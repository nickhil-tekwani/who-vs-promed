Concern of Coccidiodomycosis in San Joaquin Valley
---------------------------------------------------------
Public health officials are recommending that California hold off
with new prison construction in the southern San Joaquin Valley
because it will expose an untold number of inmates to potentially
fatal "Valley fever" [Coccidiodomycosis].
"If you put more beds down here, you can pretty much bet that some
people will be very sick and perhaps die as a result of that
decision," Kings County Public Health Officer Michael MacLean said.
Valley fever is caused by molds that grow in the region's soil. When
stirred up by construction or other means, such as wind or
earthquakes, its airborne spores can lodge in the lungs and create
symptoms ranging from a mild viral illness to respiratory failure. It
can also cause skin lesions and bone problems.
Last year [2006], more than 500 Valley fever cases were reported at
the 5000-inmate Pleasant Valley State Prison in Coalinga. A total of
4 inmates at the prison died of Valley fever in 2005.
As a result, health professionals and researchers submitted a report
urging the state not to add prison beds "in the hyper-endemic area,"
where Valley fever spores are prevalent. They also suggested that the
state evaluate exposure to the disease and "consider relocating all
inmates" from Pleasant Valley if it can't fix the problem. "People in
that prison population are at high risk of coming down with Valley
fever," Edward Moreno, director of the Fresno County Health
Department, said.
The recommendations were generated by a working group that includes
physicians from the California Department of Corrections and
Rehabilitation, public health officers from 7 counties and 2
University of California academic experts. The report was submitted
in June [2007] to federal receiver Robert Sillen, who oversees
medical care in California prisons, and is posted on his Web site.
Corrections officials said they are preparing a response to the
report that will include mitigation measures "in terms of
construction and in terms of health care," said Robin Dezember, the
prison agency's chief of health care services.
Inmates last year made up two-thirds of all the Valley fever cases in
Fresno and Kings counties, according to the report.
In the San Joaquin Valley, the disease hits hardest in populations
that are not native to the area. MacLean said infections also occur
in his county at higher rates at the Lemoore Naval Air Station and
among African-Americans, who are disproportionately represented in
the prison system.
The report to Sillen was prepared by Dr. Dwight Winslow, the prison
system's statewide medical director. New construction, Winslow said,
is going to cause a problem at the San Joaquin Valley prisons, no
matter if the infill program expands their population or merely
replaces the emergency beds.
"Whether they have construction methods that can mitigate it, I don't
know," he said. "I do know that disturbing the soil is going to be an
issue."
Reported instances of Valley fever among inmates in the southern San
Joaquin Valley increased more than 6-fold from 2001 to 2006, to 672
cases last year [2006], including 514 at Pleasant Valley State Prison
and 91 at nearby Avenal State Prison. Officials suspect construction
of a new hospital near Pleasant Valley for the big jump in its Valley
fever rate. It reported only 47 instances of Valley fever in 2002.

[Valley fever is caused by a fungus, _Coccidioides immitis_, found in
soils primarily in southwestern states in the USA. The fungus is
stirred into the air in dry, dusty conditions and inhaled. Prevalence
surveys 50 years ago in California central valley estimate an annual
risk of infection of up to 15 percent in school children, but more
recent studies suggest that present rate is around 3 percent per
year. It is possible that repeated exposure results in a degree of
protective immunity, which mean that immigrants from non-endemic
areas have a higher risk of symptomatic infection. The symptoms are
cough, chest pain, shortness of breath fever and fatigue. It can
easily be confused with pneumonia from other causes and asthma. -
