Source: Periodic update on the Zika outbreak in Yap State, Federated States
of Micronesia [edited]

Cases of Zika have significantly slowed on Yap Proper. The most recent
suspected case presented on 17 July [2007] at Yap Memorial Hospital. The
total cases that presented to health care are now 99 confirmed cases (by
PCR [polymerase chain reaction] and IgM analysis) and 54 probable cases.
Probable cases have been identified in the neighboring islands Ulithi,
Fais, Earpik, Woleai, and Ifalik. A travel advisory [notice has been
issued] and the distribution of WHO donated mosquito repellent to the
neighboring islands is ongoing. Serum collection on the affected
communities has been coordinated for the next field trip.
To review:
The community survey of Yap Proper has been completed and data is now being
analyzed. It involved an environmental survey, entomologic collection, and
serosurvey. The success of the survey owes much to the Wa'ab Community
Health Center (WCHC). The WCHC utilizes health workers from each area of
Yap Proper. They provide outreach into their own communities and were
essential in getting the survey teams into the villages. The survey also
had vital technical support from the CDC, FSM National Government, WHO and
Institut Pasteur. The data is currently undergoing analysis.
A travel advisory for all in-bound and out-bound passengers to Yap remains
in effect. It asks that individuals visiting Yap avoid mosquito bites. If a
visitor to Yap falls ill while in Yap or after returning home, they are
requested to report to a health professional. In order to reduce the risk
of infecting other islands or other countries, individuals are strongly
advised not to travel if they are feeling ill.
