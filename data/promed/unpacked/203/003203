Foot-And-Mouth Beats Retreat in Rwanda
-----------------------------------------------------------
Kigali, Rwanda: Official sources in Kigali Thursday said a foot-and-mouth
epidemic, which has raged [in] Rwanda since February [2001], was at length
receding. "Of recent," said Agriculture, Livestock and Forestry minister
Ephraim Kabaija, "quarantine measures in affected Provinces have had a
visible effect checking a spread of the disease." Kabaija announced at a
news conference that the quarantine would be lifted next week in the Butare
Province and North Kigali. The north-eastern province of Umutara (most
affected by the disease) and the eastern province of Kibungo would have to
wait until the end of May before they get a break with quarantine measures,
the minister said.
Agriculture and livestock officials blame the latest attack on 3 Umutara
farmers said to have brought in affected cows from Tanzania and Uganda.
Rwanda is currently receiving technical aid from the Food and Agriculture
Organisation and South Africa to contain the epidemic.
"This disease has to be eradicated before the beginning of the dry season,
otherwise farmers would lose a lot of livestock," Kabaija warned.
Meanwhile, a ban on beef sales has been lifted in the north-western
provinces Ruhengeri and Gisenyi. Butchers had been ordered to slaughter
animals only in the presence of a veterinary doctor who would inspect the
meat before its transportation in refrigerated trucks escorted by security
forces all the way to the point of sale.
As part of measures to counter the outbreak, 39 cows were incinerated
following a compensation agreement between the government and breeders. The
quarantine imposed in several regions of the country shot the price of meet
and dairy products up more than 100 per cent.
According to officials at the Agriculture ministry, Rwanda recorded export
losses of about 75 000 US dollars in February and early March.
