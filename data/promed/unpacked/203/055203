[This outbreak is continuing, with numbers of reported cases increasing
from 10 on 4 Oct 2010 to the 38 confirmed and a total of 204 confirmed and
suspected cases in the report above. ProMED-mail would be interested in
receiving information about measures being taken to control the _Aedes_
mosquito vectors. Since _Aedes_ mosquitoes can transmit both chikungunya
and dengue viruses, this area is at risk of dengue virus transmission as well.
