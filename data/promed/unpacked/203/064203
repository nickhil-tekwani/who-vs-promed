Coclé provincial health authorities have confirmed the first hantavirus [infection] case this year [2022]. They indicated that this is a 43 year old female patient from the Olivo community in the Nate district, who presented with the first symptoms of the disease. They explained that the patient was kept between 24-28 hours in the intensive care unit in the Rafael Estévez Hospital, and later transferred to a ward in stable condition where she remains.

One of the patient's family members survived a hantavirus [infection] 10 years ago, according to the medical team.

Health detectives indicated that epidemiological and health personnel are touring the area where this case of hantavirus was detected, in order to confirm if there are other cases.

Hantavirus infection is an emerging zoonotic disease transmitted by rodents including mice and rats. It is characterized by presentation of symptoms including fever, myalgia, and gastrointestinal signs followed by the beginning of sudden respiratory distress and hypotension.

The situation in Los Santos
---------------------------
In less than 3 months of the current year [2022], the Los Santos province has recorded a cumulative total of 5 cases of hantavirus [infections], a disease that was first detected in this region of the country in 1999.

Los Santos is one of the areas of greatest infection, and although in 2021 it accumulated 10 cases, in 2 1/2 months [of the current year, 2022], at least half of that number has been confirmed. Another aspect that draws attention is that, unlike in other years, the cases [this year, 2022] are not located in a single area. Instead, several districts have already confirmed cases of the disease.

[This is the first report of a case of hantavirus infection in Cocle province so far this year (2022). Cases have occurred in this province before with 1 fatal case in 2018 (see Hantavirus - Americas (49): Panama (LS, CC) 20180815.5968541), 1 non-fatal case in 2019 (see Hantavirus - Americas (02): Panama WHO 2018 review 20190106.6245148) and 1 death in 2021 (see Hantavirus - Americas (06): Panama 20210622.8465364).

Although the above report and previous ones do not indicate which hantavirus is responsible for these cases, an earlier WHO report indicates that Choclo is the hantavirus identified in those previous cases, based on genomic sequence analysis (see Hantavirus - Americas (02): Panama WHO 2018 review 20190106.6245148). Curiously, Choclo virus is never mentioned in the popular press reports that come to ProMED from Panama, including this one. It is reassuring to know that the virus responsible for the cases described in the WHO report mentioned above -- or at least the ones for which samples and diagnostic testing were done -- was Choclo virus, which confirms the ProMED conclusion.

Earlier, Dr Jan Clement suggested that Seoul hantavirus might be involved in some of the cases in the Americas, including Panama. The rodent reservoir of Seoul virus is the ubiquitous brown rat (_Rattus norvegicus_). Presumably, genomic analysis by the Gorgas Lab would have detected this virus. Nonetheless, diagnostic laboratories should be aware of this possibility and look for it.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents live in and around agricultural areas and the adjacent houses and buildings. They can be persistently infected with the virus and shed it in urine, feces, and saliva, the source of human infection. - Mod.TY
