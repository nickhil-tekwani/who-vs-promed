[The health authorities have promptly mounted an integrated response to this single case of Nipah virus infection. The circumstances under which this young man became infected is not stated. Perhaps the follow on investigation may provide some clues. Field studies of _Pteropus giganteus_ fruit bats in the area would be of particular interest. One hopes that there will be no further infections among the contacts of the case. - Mod.TY
