Dead and dying raccoons have been showing up throughout the Duluth area
this summer, the apparent victims of canine distemper. Dave Yankus, a
Duluth-based wild animal rescuer, said the highly contagious disease could
be affecting up to one-third of the area's raccoon population. "But there's
really no way to know for sure," said Carrie Siegle, the director of the
Duluth Animal Shelter, which has been fielding calls about sick and erratic
raccoons for about three months. "There's been so many different people
trying to deal with the problem, that we don't know how many animals are
affected," she said. "But we're talking about hundreds."
The distemper outbreak could cause trouble for family pets. Unvaccinated
dogs can easily catch the disease, which is almost always fatal, from
raccoon saliva or droppings. The disease can also be transmitted through
the air. Pet owners in the area are urged to get their pets vaccinated for
distemper.
On Thursday, Yankus collected two ailing raccoons, one on each side of the
city, and both suffering from the disease. The animals were euthanized and
sent to Minneapolis [presumably The University of Minnesota Veterinary
School] for necropsy. Disease confirmation is awaited. For the time being
the authorities are working on the assumption that canine distemper is the
culprit.
What was a thriving raccoon population, after two mild winters, is dying
all over the area. The raccoons display the symptoms of canine distemper:
discharge from the eyes, respiratory distress, seizures and convulsions.
The animals also show no fear and are often found wandering in the open
during the day, a highly unusual behavior for the normally nocturnal and
human-wary mammals. Affected animals are being euthanized as recovery is
unlikely and to stop spread of the infection. It presents no danger to
humans.
An adult male raccoon caught Thursday morning near Denfeld High School was
just standing in the shade between two garages. When approached, the animal
scaled a tree but suffered a seizure and fell.
The second raccoon captured Thursday took Laura Blackmon by surprise. She
was working in her backyard on East 10th Street, when she realized a young
raccoon was standing near her feet. The animal was captured and destroyed.
It, too, showed characteristics of distemper, with crusty, watery eyes and
a lethargic demeanor.
The illness affecting raccoons started appearing in late May. "Raccoons
were dropping like flies in June," Yankus said. He believes the
naturally-occurring disease spread rapidly in what was a larger-than-normal
raccoon population. He hopes that a cold winter in 1999 will eliminate
diseased animals.
Duluth veterinarian Deserie Bremer said that anyone who spots a raccoon
displaying the symptoms described shouldn't attempt to handle it; call the
Duluth Animal Shelter at 723-3259 or call 911.

[Never approach a wild animal in these circumstances but call the relevant
control agency to deal with it. Unless you know what you are looking at,
the non-veterinary public should always keep in mind that it could be a
rabid raccoon. It would be appreciated if our academic veterinary
colleagues at the Universithy of Minnesota would provide the missing
background information on this outbreak. - MHJ]
