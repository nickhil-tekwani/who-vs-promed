A comment: Australia should not immediately sanction influenza
vaccination of the general horse population
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The diagnosis, control, and eradication of equine influenza from the
Australian horse population following its 1st ever introduction in
August 2007 and its eradication by December 2007 was an outstanding
example of disease control in the modern era.

The chief veterinary officers (CVO) in each of the 3 affected states
and CVO (Australia), and their staffs including laboratory support
did a remarkably effective job in pursuing eradication to the last
case. There was highly coordinated support from the veterinary
profession and most of all from horse owners.

At the outset there were 2 simple but serious breaches of
well-established quarantine protocols that led to the introduction of
equine influenza into Australia.

First, 13 horses (7 shuttle stallions and 6 mares) were transported
from Japan to Melbourne; 4 of the stallions continued on the flight
to Sydney and then to the Eastern Creek Quarantine Station.

There is evidence that active equine influenza virus infection was
present in the group of Japanese horses.

Existing pre-export quarantine protocols should not have allowed
infected horses to leave Japan.

The 2nd breach, this time of post-arrival protocols, occurred at the
Eastern Creek Quarantine Station and these breaches led to the wide
dissemination of the virus in New South Wales and Queensland.

In ProMED-mail posting "Equine Influenza - Australia (05)
20080925.3037," NSW Primary Industries minister Ian Macdonald
recommends voluntary vaccinations of all horses in NSW.

It was suggested that the decision on compulsory vaccination should
be left to individual sectors within the horse industry; each sector
would have the ability to impose its own rules.

Such recommendations would almost certainly lead to equine influenza
becoming endemic in Australia, as it is in most of the rest of the
world, with accompanying large annual costs. The recommendation would
undo the enormous achievement of eradicating the disease.

The immediate objective should be to maintain the equine influenza
disease free status that existed in Australia before August 2007 and
let the recommendations of the Callinan enquiry
(<http://www.equineinfluenzainquiry.gov.au>), aimed at making our
biosecurity arrangements for the horse industry as safe as possible,
take effect.

It is self-evident that the experiences of the equine influenza
epidemic and its aftermath cannot be viewed as a horse industry
specific phenomenon. The same agencies and people are involved in
animal biosecurity in general and the expected tightening of animal
biosecurity matters will flow through to all sections. The ad hoc
industry specific proposals now being advanced for the horse industry
could set a dangerous precedent whereby special interest groups could
influence national disease control programs.

As evidenced by the infected, vaccinated Japanese horses that arrived
in Australia 8 Aug 2007, equine influenza vaccine, regardless of the
type of vaccine used, does not guarantee full protection from
disease, infection, or the elimination of the virus. Vaccination does
reduce the severity of clinical signs and in so doing can mask the
presence of the virus leading to a chain of infection that may run
for a long time before the virus is detected. Vaccination will almost
certainly lead to the virus becoming endemic and remaining endemic
for the rest of time.

Overseas experts from the UK and US are quoted as providing support
for Minister MacDonald's view. The experts are from counties where
equine influenza is endemic and where the disease carries a large
annual cost. The experts should look at the Australian experience and
appreciate that equine influenza is an eminently eradicable disease.
There is no long-term carrier status for the virus in horses and no
significant other animal reservoirs, as is the case for influenza
viruses of other species.

As pointed out in ProMED-mail "Equine Influenza - Australia (06)
20080927.3063" from Dr Andy Carroll CVO (Australia), equine influenza
has been eradicated from Australia and the country has remained free
from any evidence of the disease; following the last case in December
2007 more than 35 000 horses have been tested by PCR [polymerase
chain reaction] and none tested positive for the virus.

In a broader setting it is notable that since the early 1980s more
than 80 new or re-emerging virus diseases of humans, many transmitted
to humans from other animals, have been recognised and many, such as
SARS, Hendra, Nipah, and monkeypox, were quickly recognised and contained.

When first recognised such diseases throw up many questions for
policy formulation. Uninformed wrong decisions can be made, none more
devastating than the human tragedy that is HIV/AIDS, which with the
luxury of hindsight was poorly dealt with when it first emerged in
the early 1980s. There was much misunderstanding and misinformation,
one case in point: an authority stated that 'the first case in a
particular city had been diagnosed but that it was a mild case and
there was no need to worry.' This of course was done to allay fear in
the general community. Decisions did not take account of what had
been learned from the prototype lentivirus, similar to HIV, that
affected sheep in Iceland in the 1930s and was shown to be non
eradicable other than by removal and restocking programs.

Equine influenza is at the opposite end of the spectrum of diseases
to HIV and can be eliminated in a regional setting such as Australia.

It is possible that the sectional industry view supporting general
vaccination will prevail and that in Australia equine influenza will
become endemic for the rest of time.

Such a view, at least in the short term, should not be countenanced.
Strategic use of vaccine in Australia has been available for many
years as required for horses competing overseas or as a condition of
export sale and that use of equine influenza vaccine should continue.

The re-enforcement and improvement of Australian animal biosecurity
measures that will follow the eradication of equine influenza should
be allowed to work.

The potential for Australia to remain free from equine influenza
virus should not be compromised by general or partial equine
influenza vaccination programs.

[ProMED-mail welcomes the opportunity to communicate Professor
Michael Studdert's views on the undesirability of continuing equine
influenza vaccination in Australia. - Mod.CP]

[Containment and eradication of diseases generally involve a large
measure of biosecurity and vaccination or slaughter. Slaughter within
the horse industry is not viewed favorably. Biosecurity breaks are
not respective of vaccine effectiveness. Consequently to recommend
not vaccinating here, may have extended the outbreak and although the
vaccine may not be 100 percent effective, the current risk of
reinfection is high enough that vaccination for a limited time may be
justifiable. Likewise, shoring up biosecurity regulations and
operations is a separate issue than vaccination. - Mod.TG]
