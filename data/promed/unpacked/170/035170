Following the outbreak of Japanese encephalitis in Chitwan, awareness campaigns have been launched in the district. A rapid response team coordinated by chief of the district health office has been formed, and special measures have been adopted to contain the risks of the disease, according to health office Chief Durgadatta Chapagain. So far, of 22 tests, 9 cases of Japanese encephalitis have been confirmed in the district.

"Representatives from Bharatpur Hospital, 2 medical colleges, a private hospital and Nepal Red Cross Society are members of the response team that has been on standby in all 7 local levels," he said. Following the decision, buffer stocks of medicines required during the pandemic at all the local levels and health office have been managed. "The team will immediately reach out and respond to the crisis when there is a sudden outbreak of any disease," said Chapagain.

Arrangements have been made for the main response team to prepare report on a daily basis when it finds suspects of any pandemic, including Japanese encephalitis. "Doctors belonging to the World Health Organisation were consulted on what types of Japanese encephalitis patients should be under surveillance," he said. Reportedly, doctors have continuously taken stock of infected patients and their families.

The team also discussed with medical superintendents and directors of major hospitals in the district and chief of the medical department on matters related to preparedness. Chiefs of the health sections at all the local levels have been asked to adopt preparedness measures.

So far, 4 cases of Japanese encephalitis have been confirmed in Bharatpur metropolis, 2 in Madi Municipality, and one each in Rapti, Ratnanagar and Kalika municipalities. The infection was first detected in the 1st week of August [2022] and 7 cases were diagnosed last week alone. This suggests that the district has been hit. Of the infected, 5 were females and 4 were males, aged 29-75 years.

According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a flavivirus related to dengue, yellow fever and West Nile viruses, and it is spread by mosquitoes. For every case detected, there may be 300 hidden cases. As per WHO, the infection is mostly asymptomatic and has mild short-lived symptoms.

Office Chief Durga Dutta Chapagain said, "On the basis of the WHO assessment, it can be said that the district is probably gripped by Japanese encephalitis, as there may be 2700 cases across the district. This is probably the 1st time the district is tackling the situation at this level. So far, no JE fatality has been reported in the district."

In 2018, 2020 and 2021, the district reported one case each year and the figure was nil in 2019.

As per the WHO, the virus is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected _Culex_ mosquitoes, which lay eggs in irrigated rice fields and other pools of stagnant water. Pigs and birds serve as amplifying vertebrate hosts.

The 1st case of Japanese encephalitis was detected in Nepal in Rupandehi in 1978, and the year 2004 observed a nationwide campaign against the infection.

In 2006, 2011 and 2016, Nepal observed a national campaign for containment of the infection. Likewise, vaccination against Japanese encephalitis has been incorporated in the national immunisation schedule since 2009. The vaccine is given when a child completes 12 months.

The case fatality rate can be as high as 30% while permanent neurologic or psychiatric sequelae can occur in 30% to 50% of those with encephalitis, WHO says. The infection is primarily seen from April/May to September/October.

According to Bharatpur Hospital's physician Dr Govinda Kunwar, pigs and ducks are primary carriers of the virus that is transmitted to mosquitoes when they bite the infected animals. It is then passed to humans when the same mosquito bites humans. It is not transmitted from human to human. The rural areas in the district seem vulnerable to the infection. Its symptoms include high fever, headache, vomiting, unconsciousness, stiff neck and body convulsions.

Information officer Ram KC has advised all and sundry to expedite proper management of the areas where pigs and ducks are reared. He has also sought prompt medical intervention in suspected cases.

[Chitwan District is located in southeastern Nepal. It is a lowland, agricultural area and Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus likely is endemic there. It is interesting to note that the reported JE cases are all adults aged 29-75 years and not children, as is the case in northeastern India. The absence of cases in children may reflect JE vaccination inclusion in routine childhood vaccination efforts. The mobilization of the established main response team in response to these JE cases should provide coordination of surveillance and treatment efforts. - Mod.TY
