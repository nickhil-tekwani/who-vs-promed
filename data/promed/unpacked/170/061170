In the municipality of Sedrata (Souk Ahras), an outbreak of 15 cases of brucellosis among cattle has been recorded, as reported on Tuesday [12 Apr 2022] by the state veterinary inspectorate.

The veterinary inspector, Ahmed Muqati, explained to Algeria Press Service that this outbreak was investigated on Monday evening [11 Apr 2022] following the results of veterinary analysis conducted by the regional veterinary laboratory of the neighboring state of El Tarf. Blood samples were taken from 62 dairy cows on the same livestock farm in the municipality of Sedrata.

The results of the analysis revealed 15 positive cases out of 62 cows, as indicated by the same official, adding that the legal procedures in force were initiated by sending an order for the mandatory slaughter of the 15 cows infected with brucellosis.

The state veterinary inspector said that after the compulsory slaughter of the cows concerned, the farmer concerned will submit a file for compensation in accordance with veterinary legislation.

[The following comment by Mod. SF is notable: "Brucellosis is endemic and enzootic in Algeria. Human cases have often been the revealer of an infection of insidious evolution in animals. The infection is transmitted to people by direct or indirect contact with infected animals or their products (especially raw milk and other dairy products derived from raw milk)".

Results of a 2021-published study showed that _B. abortus_ biovar 3 is the dominant species in cattle in Algeria. _Brucella melitensis_ biovar 2 and biovar 3 were also recovered. In total, 161 cattle from 97 dairy farms in 56 towns of 13 wilayas (provinces), sampled during a period of 30 months, were examined in the study (Citation: Lounes N, Melzer F, Sayour AE, Tali Maamar H. et al. Identification, geographic distribution and risk factors of _Brucella abortus_ and _Brucella melitensis_ infection in cattle in Algeria. Veterinary Microbiology Vol 254, March 2021, 109004. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2021.109004).

Infection with Brucella in cattle is usually caused by _B. abortus_. _B. melitensis_, the main causative agent of brucellosis in sheep and goats, is known to infect cattle exposed to infected sheep/goats. In regions suffering endemic _B. melitensis_ in small ruminants, such as West Asia/North Africa, its spillover to cattle appears to be more common than earlier recognized. This pathogen is less abortifacient in cattle than _B. abortus_, but it readily infects the mammary glands, exposing rural communities, relevant professionals (such as dairymen, veterinarians and slaughterhouse personnel) and (but to a lesser extent if milk is pasteurized), consumers.

_B. melitensis_ is of relative high pathogenicity to humans ("Malta fever").

For a definitive identification of a _Brucella_ species, a combination of growth characteristics, serological, bacteriological or molecular methods is required. Further information from knowledgeable sources about the _Brucella_ identified by laboratory tests in samples from the (15) brucellosis-suspected, slaughtered cattle from Souk Ahras province, would be appreciated. - Mod.AS
