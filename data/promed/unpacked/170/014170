I did a Google search and got some feedback. 5 children died in Shanghai
Children's Hospital (SCH), Beijing Road (there is another branch in
Dongfangdadao). The local communicable disease control collected specimens,
but no test results have been reported as of yet. The hospital has been
under guard since the incident (no surprise, after 5 mysterious deaths in
one night). All the children had been transferred to SCH from other
hospitals in Shanghai or other cities (not named). Autopsy results might
take 10 days. The hospital declared that the children were mostly premature
[infants] and seriously ill when transferred to SCH, but the parents denied
this. One news report said there were 20 more children under close
monitoring. I will keep a close eye on the situation; this is all I have so
far.
