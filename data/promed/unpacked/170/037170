[Receiving timely information on events such as this one is always of value. However, with the specific case of Cambodia, an answer to a request for information made in posting 20160127.3970770 is still pending. In January 2016 thousands of birds (poultry) died in the province of Kampong Thum. Knowing the results of the epidemiological investigations, the type of laboratory tests used, and whether or not the cause of death was determined would be helpful.

In 2015, Cambodia reported to the OIE 2 outbreaks of HPAI H5N1. These outbreaks were located in the provinces of Battambang and Siem Reap. That event was resolved on 18 Nov 2015. See event summary and map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=19082
