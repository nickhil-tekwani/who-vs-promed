Six More Crows Test Positive for West Nile Virus In Illinois
------------------------------------------------------------
CRETE, Illinois: A total of 6 dead crows found in Will County, 3 in the
Crete and Steger areas, have tested positive for West Nile virus. The birds
were among 12 sent to the Illinois Department of Agriculture laboratory in
Galesburg by the Will County Health Department, according to Vic Reato,
media services manager for the department. Will County is now one of 5
Illinois counties where West Nile virus-infected birds have been found. A
total of 96 birds have tested positive. "At some point really (it) becomes a
moot point because birds fly," Reato said. "If you find one bird in the
county, it would be safe to assume that all birds could be affected because
birds travel and mosquitoes travel. They have been found in Cook, Lake and
DuPage.
The affected birds were found in Crete, Steger, Lockport, Shorewood and
Frankfort Square. In addition 2 birds, one from New Lenox and one from
Joliet, tested negative. No human cases have been reported in Illinois.

is difficult to draw any conclusion about the course of the outbreak in
