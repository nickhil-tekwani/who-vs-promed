Update number 351 (based on data up to 15 Sep 2019)
---------------------------------------------------
Information in this report is categorized by influenza transmission zones, which are geographical groups of countries, areas or territories with similar influenza transmission patterns. For more information on influenza transmission zones, see the link below:

Summary
-------
- In the temperate zones of the southern hemisphere, influenza activity was low in most countries, except Chile where a 2nd wave of influenza activity of predominately B viruses was reported.
- In the Caribbean, and tropical South American countries, influenza activity was low overall. In Central American countries, influenza activity continued to increase in El Salvador.
- In tropical Africa, influenza activity was low across reporting countries.
- In Southern Asia, influenza activity was low across reporting countries except in Bhutan where influenza activity continued to be reported above alert threshold.
- In South East Asia, influenza activity was low in most reporting countries and continued to be reported at moderate level in Malaysia and Myanmar.
- In the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere, influenza activity remained at inter-seasonal levels overall.
- Worldwide, seasonal influenza A viruses accounted for the majority of detections.

National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 80 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from 2 Sep 2019 to 15 Sep 2019 (data as of 27 Sep 2019 04:26:41 UTC). The WHO GISRS [Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System] laboratories tested more than 36 387 specimens during that time period. 2704 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 1650 (61%) were typed as influenza A and 1054 (39%) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 405 (31.7%) were influenza AH1N1)pdm09 and 874 (68.3%) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 63 (17.7%) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 292 (82.3%) to the B-Victoria lineage.

The WHO Consultation and Information Meeting on the Composition of Influenza Virus Vaccines for Use in the 2020 Southern Hemisphere Influenza Season was held on 23-26 Sep 2019 in Geneva, Switzerland. It was recommended that trivalent vaccines contain the following: an A/Brisbane/02/2018 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus; an A/South Australia/34/2019 (H3N2)-like virus; and a B/Washington/02/2019-like (B/Victoria lineage) virus. It was also recommended that quadrivalent vaccines containing 2 influenza B viruses contain the above 3 viruses and a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like (B/Yamagata lineage) virus.

Source of data
--------------
The Global Influenza Programme monitors influenza activity worldwide and publishes an update every 2 weeks. The updates are based on available epidemiological and virological data sources, including FluNet (reported by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System), FluID (epidemiological data reported by national focal points), and influenza reports from WHO Regional Offices and Member States. Completeness can vary among updates due to availability and quality of data available at the time when the update is developed.

[2] Composition of the southern hemisphere 2020 vaccine
Date: Fri 27 Sep 2019

http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/09/two-strains-changed-southern-hemisphere-2020-flu-vaccine


A World Health Organization (WHO) advisory group that met this week [23-26 Sep 2019] in Geneva to assess strains to include in the southern hemisphere's 2020 flu vaccines recommended swapping out the H3N2 component and one that covers the influenza B Victoria lineage.

The new H3N2 component is A/South Australia/34/2019, which replaces A/Kansas/14/2017 -- the group's delayed pick for the northern hemisphere's upcoming flu season. The newly recommended H3N2 strain is also a change from the one included in this season's southern hemisphere vaccine, which was A/Switzerland/8060/2017.

Also, the new influenza B Victoria lineage strain is B/Washington/02/2019, which bumps out B/Colorado/06/2017, the one the experts recommended for last season's northern hemisphere vaccines and this season's southern hemisphere vaccine.

The group's pick for the 2009 H1N1 strain is the same as this season's northern hemisphere vaccine, but is different than the one included in the current southern hemisphere vaccine, which is A/Michigan/45/2015.

The WHO recommends the following for the southern hemisphere vaccines:
- for H1N1, an A/Brisbane/02/2018-like virus
- for H3N2, an A/South Australia/34/2019-like virus
- for B Victoria, a B/Washington/02/2019-like virus
- for Yamagata, a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus

For egg-based trivalent versions that have only one B strain, the experts recommended including the Victoria lineage vaccine virus (B/Washington/02/2019).Overall pattern shows little flu B activity

Overall pattern shows little flu B activity
-------------------------------------------
When the advisors looked at flu patterns between February and September [2019], they noted that influenza A viruses predominated in most countries, with cocirculation of 2009 H1N1 and H3N2 seen in all countries.

Influenza B, however, circulated in higher proportions in Southeast Asia and in some countries in the southern cone of South America, such as Chile. The Victoria lineage was predominant in most global regions, except South America, which saw more Yamagata lineage viruses.

Increasing proportions of H3N2 subclade
---------------------------------------
In March [2019], when the experts announced their delayed H3N2 pick, they said they were watching increased numbers of genetically and antigenically diverse strains, with the number of 3C.3a viruses rising in several geographic regions. In their report today [27 Sep 2019], they said there's a significant increase in the proportion of viruses within the 3C.2a1b subclade.

Tests using ferret sera and human serology studies found that the A/South Australia/34/2019 vaccine strain offered better protection than the strains included in the current southern hemisphere vaccine and the latest version of the northern hemisphere vaccine.

The vaccine advisory group meets twice a year to recommend influenza vaccine viruses, in February to select ones for the next northern hemisphere flu season and in September to pick strains to include in southern hemisphere vaccines that will be offered for its next season.

During their meetings, the experts also review the latest information on zoonotic flu viruses and recommend new candidate vaccine viruses for pandemic preparedness, if needed. The WHO said the group's zoonotic flu summary from the meeting will be available shortly and will appear on the agency's website.

[3] Implications of southern hemisphere vaccine selection for the northern hemisphere
Date: Mon 30 Sep 2019
Source: STAT News [abridged, edited]
https://www.statnews.com/2019/09/30/flu-vaccine-selections-may-be-an-ominous-sign-for-this-winter/


It's never an easy business to predict which flu viruses will make people sick the following winter. And there's reason to believe 2 of the 4 choices made last winter for this upcoming season's vaccine could be off the mark.

Twice a year influenza experts meet at the World Health Organization to pore over surveillance data provided by countries around the world to try to predict which strains are becoming the most dominant. The Northern Hemisphere strain selection meeting is held in late February; the Southern Hemisphere meeting occurs in late September.

The selections that officials made last week for the next Southern Hemisphere vaccine suggest that 2 of 4 viruses in the Northern Hemisphere vaccine that doctors and pharmacies are now pressing people to get may not be optimally protective this winter. Those 2 are influenza A/H3N2 and the influenza B/Victoria virus.

The strain selection committee concluded the H3N2 and B/Victoria viruses needed to be updated because the ones used in the Northern Hemisphere vaccine didn't match the strains of those viruses that are now dominant. Influenza epidemiologist Dr. Danuta Skowronski described the significance of those 2 changes in one word: "mismatch."

"I think the vaccine strain selections by the WHO committee are obviously important for the southern hemisphere but they're also signals to us because they're basing their decisions on what they see current predominating on the global level," said Dr Danuta Skowronski, who is with the British Columbia Center for Disease Control in Vancouver.

Flu vaccine is a 4-in-1 or a 3-in-1 shot that protects against both influenza A viruses -- H3N2 and H1N1 -- and either both or one of the influenza B viruses, B/Victoria and B/Yamagata. Most flu vaccine is made with killed viruses, and most vaccine used in the United States is quadrivalent -- 4-in-1.

There was great uncertainty around which version of H3N2 to choose for the northern hemisphere vaccine when the committee met last February [2019] -- there was a lot of variation between the strain the US was seeing and the H3N2 viruses sickening people in Canada and Europe. There was so much uncertainty, in fact, that the committee delayed making the choice of the H3N2 strain for a month to try to get a clearer picture.

In the end, the committee selected a version of the virus that was causing a wave of late season illness in the United States. (Canada also had a late season surge of H3N2 activity, but caused by a different version of the virus.)

"That H3N2 wave was late and it was evolving at the time that they met in February [2019]," Skowronski said of the strain selection committee. "And there was a diverse mix of H3 viruses. And it wasn't clear to them, I guess, [which strain] ... would emerge the clear winner."

It appears the virus that was ultimately selected is not the H3N2 that dominated during the southern hemisphere's winter 2019 season.

Scott Hensley, an associate professor of microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania, said the variant of H3N2 viruses that just swept through the southern hemisphere is more likely to be the main cause of H3N2 infections for the northern hemisphere this winter [2019-20] than was the case in the US late last winter [2018-19] and into the early spring.

But that version of H3N2 is difficult to grow in eggs, which is the way the vast majority of flu vaccines is made, he noted, suggesting that fact may have influenced the thinking of the selection committee last March.

In recent years the H3N2 component has generally been the least effective part of the vaccine. If H3N2 viruses predominate this coming flu season, a vaccine mismatch could add to the severity of the season. But if those viruses play a smaller role this winter, the impact of a mismatch will be less significant, making it hard to predict if this choice is going to turn out to be a problem.

Flu circulation "remains difficult to predict and flu viruses are constantly breaking rules that we try to establish for them," Hensley said, adding that flu vaccines "often protect against severe disease even when ... mismatched."

[The selection of the annual influenza vaccine is based on the best possible 'guesstimate' inferred from surveillance, and antigenic and genetic analyses of the circulating influenza A & B strains. The WHO's Global Influenza Programme (GIP) provides global standards for influenza surveillance. In addition GIP collects and analyzes virological and epidemiological influenza surveillance data from around the world. The regular sharing of quality influenza surveillance and monitoring data by countries allows WHO to:
- provide countries, areas, and territories with information about influenza transmission in other parts of the world to allow national policy makers to better prepare for upcoming seasons;
- describe critical features of influenza epidemiology including risk groups, transmission characteristics, and impact;
- monitor global trends in influenza transmission; and
- support the selection of influenza strains for vaccine production.
