Tompkins County [New York State, USA] has seen an uptick in gonorrhea cases this year [2015], according to statistics provided by the New York Department of Health.

So far, in 2015, 37 cases of gonorrhea in Tompkins County have been reported. That's up from the following statistics for the same point in previous years: 2014 -- 13; 2013 -- 17; and 2012 -- 13.

"Yes, it has increased, and it is of concern," says Theresa Lyczko, spokesperson for the Tompkins County Health Department, in an interview on Friday [7 Aug 2015]. The reason for the increase is unclear, Lyczko said. The rise of gonorrhea cases locally was highlighted by Dr. Edward Koppel at a meeting in late July 2015 of the Tompkins County Board of Health. There are plans underway to increase local education and awareness about the prevention of sexually transmitted infections (STI), including gonorrhea, Lyczko said. "We're educating them and reminding them that it goes for all STI's that people need to take precautions," she said.

The increase in gonorrhea, she said, spanned different age spectrums. That included everyone from teenagers to older adults and seniors, she said.

Rates of chlamydia [infection] also appear to be at least slightly higher this year [2015] than in previous ones, according to the statistics. Here are the chlamyida rates at this point in the year since 2012: 2015 -- 174; 2014 -- 137; 2013 -- 131; and 2012 -- 156.

Lyczko said the numbers underscore the importance of taking precautions when having sex. "There's always the possibility of being infected," she said. "It's always important to take precautions and preventative measures."

[Gonococcal infection is caused by a sexually acquired Gram-negative diplococcal bacterial pathogen, _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_. _N. gonorrhoeae_ may be acquired at multiple mucosal sites in the lower urogenital tract, including the urethra, cervix, Bartholin's and Skene's glands in women, as well as the anorectal canal, pharynx, and conjunctivae. The infection in women may spread to the upper genital tract, uterine tubes, and abdominal cavity, as well as other systemic sites.

The news report above says that there has been an increase in cases of gonococcal infection Tompkins County in northern New York State in 2015. The cases are said to be occurring in adolescents and adults of all ages, but the report does not characterize the cases further. Were the cases both male and female, or were the cases predominantly male, as is happening in other locales, where an epidemic of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) has been occurring in men who have sex with men (MSM)?

Because, unlike men, most women with gonococcal infection do not have any symptoms, the presence of gonococcal infection in women can be underreported. Screening for gonococcal infection in women is critical to appreciate its true occurrence in women. Routine urogenital screening is recommended annually in the U.S. for all sexually active women at risk for infection, including women aged under 25 years and older women with one or more of the following risks: a previous gonococcal infection, the presence of other sexually transmitted diseases, new or multiple sex partners, inconsistent condom use, commercial sex work, drug use, or human immunodeficiency virus infection with sexual activity or pregnancy. How are women in Tompkins County being screened for gonococcal infection?

Pharyngeal gonococcal infections, common in adolescents, as well as rectal infections, are also predominantly asymptomatic, and specific screening is necessary to identify affected individuals.

Is there an associated increase in incidence of other STDs such as syphilis and HIV infection in Tompkins County? Is the outbreak of gonococcal infection in Tompkins County being facilitated by use of psychoactive drugs or use of smartphone apps that allow anonymous sexual hook-ups through the Internet? ProMED-mail would appreciate more information on this outbreak from knowledgeable sources.

Tompkins County is located in the Central Region of counties in the U.S. state of New York (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tompkins_County,_New_York). Its population is over 100 000, a large portion of which reside in the metropolitan area of the city of Ithaca, the county seat and home to both Cornell University, with a total student enrollment of over 20 000 in 2013 (https://www.cornell.edu/about/facts.cfm) and Ithaca College, with a total student enrollment of over 6500 (http://www.ithaca.edu/admission/facts/). - Mod.ML
