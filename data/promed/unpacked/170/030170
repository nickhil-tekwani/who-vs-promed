An outbreak of scrub typhus, a bacterial disease, has claimed the lives of 5 people in Nagaland's Noklak district bordering Myanmar, officials said. More than 600 others tested positive for the disease but recovered after treatment.

Scrub typhus, also known as bush typhus, spreads to people through bites of larval mites. The symptoms include fever, headache, and body ache. The district's Sub-Divisional Officer (Civil), C Phuniang, said Noklak has had to grapple with the disease in the past too, although there had been no scientific study on the whys. "People recover if treated in time. Unfortunately, 5 people died probably because they were ignorant about the disease," he stated.

Doctors and other healthcare workers in the district have been trying to create awareness on a large scale to contain the spread of the disease. "Doctors have advised people to visit a hospital in case they have the symptoms. The hospitals are well-equipped with testing kits," Mr Phuniang said.

Nagaland is a state in the far northeastern part of India. It borders the state of Assam to the west, Arunachal Pradesh and part of Assam to the north, Myanmar to the east, and Manipur to the south. Noklak, with a population of 7,674 residents in 2011, is the newest of Nagaland's 12 districts, being established on 21 Dec 2017 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noklak). A map of Nagaland districts showing the location of Noklak can be found at https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Districts_in_Nagaland.

Scrub typhus presents clinically with chills, fever, headache, muscle pain, and sometimes with a macular or maculopapular rash and eschar at the site of the chigger bite; confirmation requires laboratory testing, usually by indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay, but this will require a 4-fold rise in antibody titer between acute and convalescent specimens. Results from a single acute serum sample are unreliable, as it takes 7-10 days for IgG antibody to be detectable, and antibody will be present in a high percentage of healthy people in an endemic region. The Weil-Felix test is unreliable (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16941792), and molecular methods like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) may not be available in endemic regions. The laboratory method by which the diagnosis of scrub typhus was made in these patients is not stated.

ProMED has posted multiple reports of scrub typhus in several Indian states in the past, especially since 2011. For background information, see ProMED post Scrub typhus - India (05): background 20111208.3546. - Mod.ML]
