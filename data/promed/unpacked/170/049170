Outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa 12th update, 30 Jun 2015
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Developments since the 11th update: As of 27 Jun 2015, WHO has reported 27 541 cases, including 11 235 deaths, linked to the West African epidemic of Ebola virus disease (EVD) that began in December 2013. Ten countries reported EVD cases. Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone experienced widespread and intense transmission between July 2014 and April 2015. Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Spain, the United Kingdom, USA and Italy reported imported cases or import-related local transmission linked to the epidemic in West Africa. Liberia was declared Ebola-free on 9 May 2015, however a new confirmed case was reported on Mon 29 Jun 2015. This case has not yet been acknowledged by WHO. The 20 new confirmed cases reported in the week from 14 to 21 Jun 2015 indicate that the weekly incidence of new cases, which has leveled off over the last 10 weeks remains unchanged. Low intensity transmission continues due to incomplete contact tracing, inadequate case detection and management of new infections.

The area of transmission has expanded slightly in recent weeks and, for the 1st time in several months, 2 healthcare workers were reported to have become infected. Cases continue to be reported from the capital cities of both Guinea and Sierra Leone. Cases are still occurring outside known transmission chains. The risk of EVD spreading to countries that share borders with Guinea and Sierra Leone remains high due to frequent cross-border movement of people and insufficient Ebola surveillance in the border areas. There are particular concerns about the current transmission in Boke prefecture in northwestern Guinea and the risk of spread to Guinea-Bissau. The rainy season, which started in April 2015 and usually lasts until November, makes transportation of staff and equipment difficult and could further impair outbreak control efforts, particularly in hard-to-reach areas. The rains also increase the risk of outbreaks of other communicable diseases, such as malaria, cholera or infectious diarrhoea, which may mask symptoms of EVD and delay testing for Ebola.

Resurgence of the Ebola outbreak remains a possibility until all contacts of all cases have been identified and monitored for 21 days without developing symptoms. There is a risk that Ebola virus may be reintroduced and transmission re-established in areas that have been declared Ebola-free. Failing to achieve zero cases in all regions of the 2 countries within the next few months could result in a low-intensity, persistent human-to-human epidemic in West Africa, with recurrent surges of intensified transmission. The re-emergence of EVD transmission in countries where intense, widespread transmission has occurred and subsequently declined remains possible as a result of new transmission from the animal reservoir or reintroduction through the importation of an infectious case. Transmission is also possible from a recovered case still hosting the Ebola virus (through sexual or other contact involving immune-privileged bodily fluids.)

[3] WHO statement on recurrence of Ebola transmission in Liberia
Date: Fri 3 Jul 2014
Source: WHO [edited]
http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/ebola/03-Jul-2015-liberia/en/


On 9 May 2015, Liberia marked an important milestone in the management of their Ebola outbreak. On that day, the country was declared free of Ebola transmission because no new cases had been identified for 42 days after the safe burial of the last person confirmed to have been infected with Ebola virus disease.

Although transmission of the virus had ceased, Liberia remained at high risk of a recurrence of Ebola due to ongoing transmission in neighbouring Guinea and Sierra Leone. For this reason, Liberia then entered a 90-day period of vigilance involving testing anyone with features of Ebola virus disease and testing post-mortem swabs for Ebola virus.

On Mon 29 Jun 2015, midway through that 90-day period, a post-mortem swab taken from a 17-year-old male who died on 28 Jun 2015 from a febrile illness managed as malaria tested positive for Ebola virus disease. In accordance with standard practice for the current period of heightened vigilance throughout Liberia, a Safe and Dignified Burial team buried the young man's body safely on the same day that he died. That team also took the swab that later tested positive for Ebola virus.

Every week, Liberia has been testing hundreds of such swabs and blood samples taken from anyone with symptoms that may be caused by Ebola virus disease. When this 1st sample proved positive, the Liberian incident management system immediately activated a team to carry out a detailed investigation in the area and began tracing people who had been in contact with the young man while he was symptomatic.

The investigation revealed that close to 200 people had been in contact with the young man while he had symptoms of Ebola, and these people are now being closely monitored. Two of those people have developed symptoms and have tested positive for Ebola virus. Both of these people are being treated in an Ebola treatment centre that had been kept at the ready as part of the 90-day heightened vigilance period.

People in the community where the young man died are now very involved in ensuring that all people who have been in contact with others infected with Ebola do not leave the area and are monitored closely. Where households are quarantined, food and supplies -- such as bedding and tents to ease household crowding -- are being provided by UN agencies, including UNICEF and the World Food Programme.

The United Nations system and nongovernmental organizations are supporting the Government with necessary supplies such as protective equipment, alcohol-based hand sprays, temperature monitors, and staff already based in Liberia. WHO is sending additional experts in epidemiology and social mobilization to ensure the community is fully involved in identifying contacts and preventing any further disease spread.

The Government has informed the people of Liberia about what is happening, and has reminded them of the key steps needed to keep themselves and their communities safe.

3 Jul 2015: Ghana launches public campaign on safety of Ebola vaccine trial
http://www.coastweek.com/3827-focus-10.htm

5 Jul 2015 Ghana: Doubts over integrity of Ebola trials
http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Doubts-over-integrity-of-Ebola-trials-366573
[The public outcry against the Ebola vaccine trials in Ghana has abated. There are still unanswered questions, however.
The main concerns raised by the Technical Committee of the Academy relate to the following:
"1. Uncertainties about the appropriateness of the vaccine, including:
a. The nature and origins of the Ebola virus, including the circumstances of its appearance in Guinea;
b. Whether the Zaire strain of the virus, which is the one being used in the GSK vaccine to be tested in Ghana, is the strain responsible for the Ebola epidemics in Liberia, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal and Sierra Leone, and
c. The identity and characteristics of other strains of the Ebola virus that might exist;
2. The use in the GSK/NIH vaccine of a gene particle of the wild species of the Zaire Ebola virus, rather than the gene particle of the Makona strain isolated in the epidemic in Guinea;
3. What pre-clinical animal experimentations had been carried out with a vaccine based on the Makona strain to establish evidence of safety, immunogenicity and protection; ... - more"
[It appears that a dialog between scientists and the community is needed to allay fears as much as possible. - Mod.LK]

1 Jul 2015 Liberia: China cautious as Ebola returns to Liberia
http://citizentv.co.ke/news/china-cautious-as-ebola-returns-to-liberia/
[The commander of the Chinese peacekeeping contingent called on all its 558 members to upgrade prevention and control levels. Personnel in protective suits have also thoroughly sterilized the contingent's base.

According to He Long, the commander: "We've launched an emergency plan in response to the new Ebola case. All officers must wear masks, gloves and protective suits before going out on missions. All vehicles must be sterilized upon return to the camp, while officers must sterilize their hands and shoes and have their temperatures taken," said He Long, the commander."]

2 Jul 2015 Liberia: UPDATE 2-Liberia investigating animal link after Ebola re-emerges
http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/02/health-ebola-liberia-idUSL8N0ZI1WB20150702?rpc=401
[According to Dr Moses Massaquoi, case management team leader for Liberia's Ebola task force, the 3 villagers who tested Ebola-positive ate dog meat together. Some locals said the deceased patient and others in the village had recently dug up and eaten a dead dog.

There is concern about the possibility of domestic animals being able to carry the virus. Fruit bats of the Pteropodidae family are known to serve as Ebola virus reservoirs.

Dr Moses Massaquoi, case management team leader for Liberia's Ebola task force, said that an investigation by the response team is underway to discover whether domestic animals might be carrying the virus, he said, referencing mysterious deaths of hundreds of cattle in remote Lofa County, which is in the northern-most portion of Liberia.

According to Ben Neuman, a virologist and Ebola expert at Reading University (UK), a possible cause of the virus resurgence could be from survivors carrying small parts of the virus in their bodies, which has reactivated the disease.

Another cause of the new Ebola cases in Liberia could be by sexual transmission, due to the persistence in semen for up to 90 days. [ProMED-mail Rapporteur Joe Dudley]

[Antibody prevalence in 15 of the 99 dogs sampled in Mekambo (15.2 percent prevalence rate).
For the full reference on Ebola virus antibody in dogs, see Allela L(1), Boury O, Pouillot R, et al. Ebola virus antibody prevalence in dogs and human risk. Emerg Infect Dis. 2005 Mar;11(3):385-90.
Abstract. During the 2001-2002 outbreak in Gabon, we observed that several dogs were highly exposed to Ebola virus by eating infected dead animals. To examine whether these animals became infected with Ebola virus, we sampled 439 dogs and screened them by Ebola virus-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) G assay, antigen detection, and viral polymerase chain reaction amplification. Seven (8.9 percent) of 79 samples from the 2 main towns, 15 (15.2 percent) of 99 samples from Mekambo, and 40 (25.2 percent) of 159 samples from villages in the Ebola virus-epidemic area had detectable Ebola virus-IgG, compared to only 2 (2 percent) of 102 samples from France. Among dogs from villages with both infected animal carcasses and human cases, seroprevalence was 31.8 percent. A significant positive direct association existed between seroprevalence and the distances to the Ebola virus-epidemic area. This study suggests that dogs can be infected by Ebola virus and that the putative infection is asymptomatic.]

http://allafrica.com/stories/201507021503.html?viewall=1
[A village neighbor said 2 people and a pregnant woman also ate the dog meat. Both people are still at large.

The Unification Town Clinic -- which backs onto the runway of Liberia's international airport, and is where the case was treated for a diagnosis of malaria prior to his death -- was quarantined. About 30 meters (100 feet) away from Unification Town Clinic, a security guard stands at the metal gate through which one may access the airport runway. There is a chlorine bucket by his side.

Workers from the Global Communities visited the clinic one Wed 1 Jul 2015 to disinfest the facility. A friend of the case was treated at another clinic, Charlesville clinic.]

<http://www.euronews.com/2015/07/02/new-ebola-cases-in-liberia-raise-fears-of-fresh-outbreak/
[The village of Nedowein, the home of the deceased 17-year-old young man, has been placed under quarantine. Health officials, wearing boots and rubber gloves, went house-to-house informing the residents of the order to remain in their homes. According to Cestus Tarpeh, a health authority spokesperson in Margibi County, the 2 new cases had been in contact with him. According to Dr. Moses Massaquoi, case management team leader for Liberia's Ebola task force, the people under surveillance include 14 health workers who have placed themselves in quarantine.

Also see http://sentinelrepublic.com/liberia-quarantines-community-where-corpse-tested-for-ebola-san-diego-6/19471/. It is noteworthy that Liberians proceeded correctly upon learning of the case. The teenager's parents called the national Ebola hotline the day their son died, and a "safe burial team," whose members wear full protective gear and are trained to handle bodies infected with Ebola, buried him that day, [Deputy Health Minister Tolbert] Nyenswah said. - Mod.LK]

3 Jul 2015 Liberia: Ebola - As virus resurfaces in Liberia, UNICEF teams and supplies arrive in affected areas
http://allafrica.com/stories/201507031638.html?viewall=1
[The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has begun distributing emergency supplies in the affected communities including tents for isolating those under quarantine, hygiene kits and chlorine and buckets for hand-washing stations. To minimize the risk of further infections and to protect and assist those affected in Margibi County, apparently the site of the index case for this outbreak, UNICEF social mobilization teams are on the ground conducting door-to-door awareness campaigns on Ebola prevention. In the next few days, the facility where the victim attended school will be decontaminated, new hygiene stations will be set up, and soap and chlorine distributed. UNICEF and Liberia's government will work to ensure anti-Ebola measures (i.e., taking the temperatures of the students before they enter the school) will be followed.]

http://www.itv.com/news/update/2015-07-03/patient-admitted-to-liverpool-hospital-for-ebola-testing/
[According to Dr Deborah Turbitt, Ebola National Incident Director at Public Health England, "Public Health England can confirm a patient has been admitted to Royal Liverpool University Hospital and is currently undergoing a series of tests, one of which is for Ebola. Ebola is considered very unlikely, but testing will take place as a precaution, as is our usual practice in these circumstances." [The patient has a history of travel in West Africa.]

But according to news on 5 Jul 2015: "UK: Ebola scare: Patient admitted to Royal Liverpool hospital tests negative for deadly virus."
