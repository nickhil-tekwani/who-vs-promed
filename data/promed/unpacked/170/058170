A 15-year-old boy has surprised doctors by contracting cowpox, a historical disease now so rare it has not been seen in Wales for more than a decade.

The teenager, who lives on the Wrexham-Cheshire border, developed lesions on his hands after feeding calves.

Public Health Wales said the last reported human case in Wales was some 10 to 15 years ago. Cowpox was more common in the 18th century when milking maids often caught it. The virus, which is not contagious from person to person, has all but disappeared because industrial farming methods mean fewer people milk cows by hand. Now it is very rare in both humans and animals, according to Public Health Wales, with feral cats most likely to catch it from rodents.

The boy's mother, who does not want to be identified, said the calves he had been feeding had nibbled on his hands, causing them to become grazed. He then developed pus-filled lesions on his hands, arms and feet. "We were really unsure what it was," she said. "The one on his ankle was worrying - it was weeping a clear liquid down his ankle."

After seeing their GP, they got sent straight to the Countess of Chester Hospital, where he was diagnosed with cowpox.

"I didn't really know what it was, so I was quite concerned. The 1st thing you do is look on the internet and that's when I found out it was quite rare," she said.

"It took weeks and weeks to go, a long time. He still has some marks on his hands."

Dr. Aysha Javed, who diagnosed the teenager after seeing the distinctive pus-filled lesions on his hands, arms and feet, said it was the 1st case of cowpox she had seen. "I think the boy and his family were quite bemused when we told them - I don't think they expected that to be the diagnosis," she said. "I think it was very itchy for him but it wasn't particularly painful."

Dr. Robert Smith, clinical scientist lead for zoonoses at Public Health Wales, said cowpox had not been reported in Wales for some 10 to 15 years. "A total of 29 laboratory reports of cowpox were received by the public health laboratories (PHLS) communicable disease surveillance centre between 1975 and 1992 (with a range of 0 to 4 reports annually)," he added.

The boy was diagnosed about 3 months ago, but his case came to light when Dr. Javed and her colleagues alerted other medics to it during a recent European Society for Pediatric Dermatology annual meeting. "We have to inform other colleagues about rare cases and, if it's something that's going to be re-emerging, public health professionals need to be alerted," she added. "We don't really see cowpox anymore - it's one of those diseases that went away."

The British Association of Dermatologists said it was very useful for doctors and members of the public to be aware of "what we might consider historical diseases making resurgence".

"Cowpox is quite unusual and, as the doctors note, when you look at a pox-like rash on a child these days the 1st thing that tends to spring to mind is chicken pox," a spokesman said. "Although this resurgence is interesting, it's not something that is particularly worrying as cowpox tends to be benign in nature to otherwise healthy people."

Subscribers are referred to Mod.CP's commentary in 20110629.1982:

"As previously commented, cowpox virus is a misnomer. Cowpox virus is not normally present in cows. The natural hosts are probably rodents, but it has been isolated from a variety of animals, including domestic and wild felines and canines, elephants and humans. Human infections have usually been traced to handling of cowpox-infected animals. Human cowpox is a rare zoonotic infection, evoking a self-limiting disease, except in the case of immunocompromised and eczematous patients (particularly children), where it can become severe.

Cowpox virus is distributed widely in Europe, western parts of the former Soviet Union, and adjacent areas of Northern and Central Asia, with an increasing number of reports originating from Europe. Genome sequence analyses have revealed considerable diversity among isolates of cowpox virus. There is a considerable literature on cowpox virus and human infection that can be accessed via the ProMED-mail archived material listed below".

A recent (2017) paper (Ref 1) included the following literature-derived comments (for the references, please go to the paper's URL):

"Cowpox virus is an orthopox virus causing rare zoonotic infections in humans. The genus _Orthopoxvirus_ is a group of large, double-stranded DNA viruses which replicate in hosts cytoplasm. Other members of the genus which infect humans are variola (causative agent of smallpox), vaccinia and monkeypox viruses. Research on cowpox virus played important part in the history of medicine. Edward Jenner's observations that infection with cowpox virus induces immunity against smallpox led to the development of the 1st vaccine.

"Humans are accidental hosts and acquire cowpox virus by close contact with infected animals. Despite its name, cowpox virus sporadically infects cattle. Most cases of human cowpox result from transmission from cats, however there have been reports of passage from rats and zoo animals. Based on geographical distribution and serological studies small rodents are currently believed to be the reservoir hosts of cowpox. Cats and other animals".

The bovine source of the reported, recent case in Wales is in need of verification.

Perhaps this human cowpox case is related to environmental exposure to the virus. Cowpox virus is endemic in voles (_Microtus agerestis_) in the UK that have population flections. There is evidence that as vole populations build up, there is increased prevalence of cowpox virus with a delay. Prevalence peaks as the vole population declines and cowpox infection may be a factor in determining vole population dynamics. When populations of infected voles are abundant, that may provide a source of human infection in those extremely rare cases- Mod. TY

Some historical information excerpted from CDCs history of smallpox:
"One of the first methods for controlling the spread of smallpox was the use of variolation. Named after the virus that causes smallpox (variola virus), variolation is the process by which material from smallpox sores (pustules) was given to people who had never had smallpox. This was done either by scratching the material into the arm or inhaling it through the nose. With both types of variolation, people usually went on to develop the symptoms associated with smallpox, such as fever and a rash. However, fewer people died from variolation than if they had acquired smallpox naturally.

"The basis for vaccination began in 1796 when an English doctor named Edward Jenner observed that milkmaids who had gotten cowpox did not show any symptoms of smallpox after variolation. The first experiment to test this theory involved milkmaid Sarah Nelmes and James Phipps, the 9 year-old son of Jenner's gardener. Dr. Jenner took material from a cowpox sore on Nelmes' hand and inoculated it into Phipps' arm. Months later, Jenner exposed Phipps a number of times to variola virus, but Phipps never developed smallpox. More experiments followed, and, in 1801, Jenner published his treatise "On the Origin of the Vaccine Inoculation," in which he summarized his discoveries and expressed hope that "the annihilation of the smallpox, the most dreadful scourge of the human species, must be the final result of this practice."

"Vaccination became widely accepted and gradually replaced the practice of variolation. At some point in the 1800s (the precise time remains unclear), the virus used to make the smallpox vaccine changed from cowpox to vaccinia virus."
