Wastewater samples taken from a San Francisco treatment plant this week have detected traces of monkeypox virus, researchers say.

Results of a 2nd detection of the virus came on Friday [24 Jun 2022], according to representatives from the Sewer Coronavirus Alert Network (SCAN).

The Oceanside Treatment Plant serves about 1/3 of San Francisco's residents on the city's west side. The samples were taken Monday [20 Jun 2022] and Thursday [23 Jun 2022]. The samples "showed small concentrations of viral DNA for the disease," researchers said.

SCAN has been testing wastewater for COVID-19 during the pandemic. Earlier this month they began testing for monkeypox DNA.

"With 2 samples in the same area, we have confidence this is a true result," said SCAN researcher Alexandria Boehm, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University.

In a news release, SCAN said the relationship between levels of monkeypox DNA in wastewater and the number of cases in the community is not yet known. They will monitor to see if there are increasing or decreasing rates of detection.

As of this week, San Francisco has 10 confirmed and probable cases of monkeypox.

On Thursday [23 Jun 2022] Bay Area health officials urged awareness of the monkeypox virus as summer travel and gatherings get underway. That same day, Santa Clara County announced its 1st suspected case of the virus.

There is treatment that can be used for monkeypox, but it's generally used in severe cases.

The Chile government declared a health alert due to the advance of monkeypox in the country. Currently, 6 people have been infected with the disease according to Soy Chile (https://www.soychile.cl/Santiago/Sociedad/2022/06/24/763593/alerta-sanitaria-viruela-del-mono.html).

The national Minister of Health, María Begoña Yarza, issued the announcement together with the international advisor of the Pan American Health Organization, Mario Cruz.

In Chile, the declaration of a health alert implies the injection of more resources for supplies, health residences, specialized personnel, and other types of tools that are needed depending on the contingency.

In any case, the authorities called for calm, a measure with which the specialists who participated in the official announcement agree.

Brazil confirmed this past Thursday [22 Jun 2022] the 1st locally acquired cases (in patients who did not travel recently) of monkeypox, in 3 people living in the city of Sao Paulo.

With the new report, the South American giant adds 14 cases in total and ranks as the nation with the most confirmed infections of the disease in Latin America.

According to the Ministry of Health, the locally acquired cases correspond to 3 men between 24 and 37 years of age "with no history of travel to countries with confirmed cases."

The remaining 11 cases were diagnosed in people who recently visited Spain, Portugal, and England, countries where the disease is on the rise.

Most of the diagnoses have been registered in the state of Sao Paulo, with 10 cases, all in its homonymous capital. The other 4 were reported in the states of Rio de Janeiro and Rio Grande do Sul, with 2 patients each.

According to the Health agency, all cases, all diagnosed patients, including those under suspicion, are isolated and under the supervision of health surveillance teams.

Cases have multiplied in the country in just 2 weeks, after health authorities reported the 1st case in Brazil on 8 Jun 2022.

[6] WHO: surveillance, case investigation, and contact tracing
Date: Fri 24 Jun 2022
Source: WHO
https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-MPX-Surveillance-2022.2


Overview
--------
This is an updated version of the previous guidance published on 22 May 2022. It applies to all countries with potential monkeypox cases, including countries that have historically documented monkeypox transmission and those that have not.

The confirmed case definition has been updated to include polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive cases, regardless of associated symptoms or their absence, in order to more fully characterize pre-symptomatic, pauci-symptomatic, or asymptomatic infections. The contact definition has been amended to include more examples of potential exposures, as well as the contact risk levels established by the monkeypox immunization guidance.

The overall goal of surveillance, case investigation and contact tracing in this context is to stop human-to-human transmission to control the outbreak. The key objectives of surveillance and case investigation are to rapidly identify cases and clusters in order to provide optimal clinical care; to isolate cases to prevent further transmission; to identify, manage and follow up contacts to recognize early signs of infection; to protect frontline health workers; to identify risk groups; and to tailor effective control and prevention measures.

Clinicians should report suspected cases immediately to local and national public health authorities. Probable and confirmed cases of monkeypox should be reported as early as possible, including a minimum dataset of epidemiologically relevant information, to WHO through IHR national focal points (NFPs).

If monkeypox is suspected, case investigation should consist of clinical examination of the patient while using appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), questioning the patient about possible sources of infection, and safe collection and dispatch of specimens for monkeypox virus laboratory examination.

As soon as a suspected case is identified, contact identification and forward contact tracing should be initiated. Contacts of probable and confirmed cases should be monitored, or should self-monitor daily for any sign or symptom for a period of 21 days from last contact. Quarantine or exclusion from work are not necessary as long as no symptoms develop.

[Accurate surveillance depends on timely diagnostic testing. In addition to the CDC test recommendations, a 23 Jun 2022 report in medRxiv (https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.06.23.22276033) entitled, "An accurate and rapid real-time PCR approach for human monkeypox virus diagnosis," states, "In this study, we present an accurate and rapid real-time PCR approach, based on conserved regions of both MPXV clades, that can be used to test clinical samples from MPXV-suspected persons. Our real-time qPCR assay can be used for the 2022 multi-country outbreak of human MPXV."

WHO Director-General's statement on the report of the Meeting of the International Health Regulations (2005) Emergency Committee regarding the multi-country monkeypox outbreak
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Monkeypox outbreak represents evolving threat that needs collective response

I am deeply concerned by the spread of monkeypox, which has now been identified in more than 50 countries, across 5 WHO regions, with 3000 cases since early May [2022]. The Emergency Committee shared serious concerns about the scale and speed of the current outbreak, noted many unknowns, gaps in current data and prepared a consensus report that reflects differing views amongst the Committee. Overall, in the report, they advised me that at this moment the event does not constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, which is the highest level of alert WHO can issue, but recognized that the convening of the committee itself reflects the increasing concern about the international spread of monkeypox. They expressed their availability to be reconvened as appropriate.

This is clearly an evolving health threat that my colleagues and I in the WHO Secretariat are following extremely closely. It requires our collective attention and coordinated action now to stop the further spread of monkeypox virus using public health measures including surveillance, contact-tracing, isolation and care of patients, and ensuring health tools like vaccines and treatments are available to at-risk populations and shared fairly.

As the Committee pointed out, monkeypox has been circulating in a number of African countries for decades and has been neglected in terms of research, attention and funding This must change not just for monkeypox but for other neglected diseases in low-income countries as the world is reminded yet again that health is an interconnected proposition.

What makes the current outbreak especially concerning is the rapid, continuing spread into new countries and regions and the risk of further, sustained transmission into vulnerable populations including people that are immunocompromised, pregnant women and children.

That is why it is urgent that all Member States, communities and individuals take the recommendations of the Committee for stepped-up surveillance, improved diagnostics, community engagement and risk communication, and the appropriate use of therapeutics, vaccines, and public health measures including contact tracing and isolation.

Since learning about the outbreak of monkeypox on 7 May 2022, WHO has issued clinical guidance and convened hundreds of scientists and researchers to speed up research and development into monkeypox and the potential for new tools to be developed. WHO has also convened meetings of community members and organizations from the LGBTQI+ community so that health information and advice on protection measures are shared effectively around mass gatherings.

WHO calls on Member States to collaborate, share information, and engage with affected communities so that public health safety measures are communicated quickly and effectively.

WHO calls on Member States and manufacturers to work together to achieve the global public health goals of ensuring that affected populations receive medical countermeasures for monkeypox and that these are used through standardized research and data collection for further evaluation of clinical effectiveness of therapeutics and vaccine effectiveness evaluations.

I thank the scientists and public health experts from around the world who participated in the Emergency Committee. We will continue to monitor the situation closely, follow their advice for continuing vigilance and possible reconvening in the coming days and weeks based on the evolution of the outbreak.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
The largest monkeypox virus (MPXV) outbreak described so far in non-endemic countries was identified in May 2022. Here, shotgun metagenomics allowed the rapid reconstruction and phylogenomic characterization of the 1st MPXV outbreak genome sequences, showing that this MPXV belongs to clade 3 and that the outbreak most likely has a single origin. Although 2022 MPXV (lineage B.1) clustered with 2018-2019 cases linked to an endemic country, it segregates in a divergent phylogenetic branch, likely reflecting continuous accelerated evolution. An in-depth mutational analysis suggests the action of host APOBEC3 in viral evolution as well as signs of potential MPXV human adaptation in ongoing microevolution. Our findings also indicate that genome sequencing may provide resolution to track the spread and transmission of this presumably slow-evolving dsDNA virus.

[A 24 Jun 2022 report stated that the strain of monkeypox involved in the current global outbreak differs from its parent strain by about 50 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) -- far more than would be expected for an orthopoxvirus, researchers reported.

There's also evidence of continued evolution and adaptation during human-to-human transmission that's occurring faster than expected, which may account for its apparently increased transmissibility, João Paulo Gomes, PhD, of Portugal's National Institute of Health in Lisbon, and colleagues reported in Nature Medicine (https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/generalinfectiousdisease/99408)

An interesting 24 Jun 2022 comment on the Nature Medicine article above was published on the Science Media Center. Dr Hugh Adler, Department of Clinical Sciences, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said:
"This report supports the prevailing hypothesis about the current outbreak: a single imported case, amplified through one or more super-spreader events. The authors describe an unexpectedly high number of mutations in the virus, but their implications for disease severity or transmissibility are unclear. We have not identified any change in the severity of clinical disease in patients diagnosed in the current outbreak.

"These findings also underline many gaps in our knowledge about the underlying genetics of monkeypox virus and the role of different genes in transmission and disease, even though this virus was 1st identified in humans half a century ago. We are seeing fascinating insights into the biology of monkeypox now that it has caused an outbreak in high income countries -- but as ever, if the global community had applied these same scientific resources to monkeypox outbreaks in Africa, we might already have a stronger knowledge base."
