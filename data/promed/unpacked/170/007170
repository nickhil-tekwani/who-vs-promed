Recently, members of the fungal genus _Neopestalotiopsis_ have been reported worldwide to affect strawberry crops. A number of species have been identified in different areas, including a potentially new species in the US [see ProMED post 20200207.6963169]. However, there is some confusion with taxonomy of the genus which has undergone multiple reclassifications. Consequently, some pathogens in earlier reports may have been misidentified. The spread of the diseases is associated with the trade of transplants.

_Neopestalotiopsis_ species cause leaf blight or spots, shoot dieback, fruit rots, and postharvest diseases on a wide range of hosts. They can also be benign endophytes or saprophytes on plants.

[_Neopestalotiopsis_ pathogens cause root and crown rot on strawberries; they can also cause leaf spot and fruit rot on the crop. Spores are mainly spread by rain and wind. External stress factors and bad growing conditions of the host favour disease development. Not much is known about the life cycle of the fungi. Disease management in strawberries may include cultural methods (no overhead irrigation, removal of affected plants, optimising plant nutrition), phytosanitary measures, and sprays with agrochemicals or copper fungicides. Some species of _Pestalotiopsis_ also affect strawberries with similar symptoms.

In North America, increased aggressiveness of root and crown rot on strawberries was noted recently. The corresponding outbreaks (see ProMED post 20200207.6963169 and links below) in both the US and Canade have now been traced to one nursery in North Carolina. Research is in progress (see link below) to determine whether this severe pathogen really is a potential new species in the genus or perhaps a new strain of a known species. Molecular studies are needed to distinguish between these possibilities.
