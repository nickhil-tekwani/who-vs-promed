[1] Geographic spread

The monkeypox virus may have spread to 11 states with 74 suspected cases recorded, Minister of Health, Isaac Adewole, has said.

Mr. Adewole made the disclosure in Abuja on Wednesday [18 Oct 2017] when he briefed State House correspondents on the outcome of the meeting of the Federal Executive Council, FEC.

President Muhammadu Buhari chaired the meeting held at the State House Council Chamber, Abuja.

The Federal Government on 11 Oct [2017] confirmed that 33 suspected cases of the virus were recorded in 7 states.

However, after samples of the suspected cases were sent for test at a WHO laboratory in Senegal, only 3 cases from Bayelsa tested positive.

Monkeypox is a rare viral zoonosis (a virus transmitted to humans from animals) with symptoms in humans similar to those seen in the past in smallpox patients, although less severe.

Smallpox was eradicated in 1980. However, monkeypox still occurs sporadically in some parts of Africa.

The minister, who updated the Council on developments in respect of the outbreak, listed the affected States as Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Cross River, Delta, Ekiti, Enugu, Imo, Lagos, Nasarawa and Rivers as well as the FCT.

"The Council also received an update on the state of the public health of the nation. We informed the council about the latest development in respect of the monkeypox virus outbreak. So far as of today, there are 74 suspected cases in 11 states of the country.

"We have confirmed 3 from Bayelsa, and 12 of the suspected cases from Bayelsa tested negative; 4 suspected cases from Lagos tested negative. We are still expecting the results of the other ones.

"We are also doing tests at the African Centre of Excellence for Genomics of Infectious Diseases (ACEGID), Edeh, to really understand the genomics of this virus. "Even when they are negative, the laboratory attendant should be able to tell us what exactly they are," he said.

The minister dismissed the rumour that the military was spreading monkeypox virus through vaccination. He said that the military was never involved in any vaccination in the country, adding that any vaccination must involve state governments and the Federal Ministry of Health.

"It is also important to dispel the rumour circulating in the country that the military is vaccinating people and trying to spread monkeypox across the country. The military is not involved in any vaccination exercise."

"And I must educate Nigerians about how vaccination campaigns are done. The Federal Government will take the lead, but we do not conduct campaigns without working with states. So, there is no way we will do campaigns without working with the states,'' he said.

[So far, the only confirmed cases are the 3 from Bayelsa state. The status of the 74 cases in the other 10 states is not yet determined by laboratory test. However, the above report indicates that 12 other cases in Bayelsa state and 4 from Lagos were tested and found negative for monkeypox.

It is not clear whether these 16 cases are included in the 74 untested suspected monkeypox cases or have been subtracted from a larger 90 case total. What is urgent, given the apparent spread of cases to 4 new states, is that these cases be laboratory tested to confirm or eliminate monkeypox as the etiological agent involved. Earlier, a health official indicated that some of these cases were varicella (chickenpox). The appearance of this many cases in such a wide geographic area in just a few days would be very unusual for monkeypox.

As noted before in the previous post, the main reservoirs of monkeypox virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp; an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_). Laboratory confirmation of the etiologies of these 74 suspected cases either as monkeypox, chickenpox, or some other pathogen are essential in order to understand what is going on. There may well be more than one pathogen circulating in the 11 states.
