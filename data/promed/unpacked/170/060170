The New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) reported Friday [20 Nov 2020] that an adult from Newport, NH tested positive for Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV). The patient was hospitalized with left side weakness, unresponsiveness and multiple seizures. The patient remains in hospital, having not recently improved.

This is the 5th person in New Hampshire to test positive for the virus this year [2020].

JCV is transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito. There are no vaccines to prevent JCV and treatment consists of rest and monitoring for escalating symptoms.

The arboviral risk level for cities and towns indicates the risk of transmission of mosquitoborne diseases to people. Risk levels will be adjusted to reflect the end of season risk for 2020, and for awareness of continued risk in the 2021 mosquito season. The arboviral risk level for Newport will be increased to high. The risk level for surrounding towns of Cornish, Croydon, Sunapee, Goshen, Unity and Claremont will increase to moderate.

"Although JCV is still a rare disease, we are seeing more infections in NH, which is concerning," Dr Benjamin Chan, New Hampshire state epidemiologist, said. "Similar to other diseases in NH that are spread through mosquito bites, like West Nile virus and eastern equine encephalitis virus, infection with JCV can cause a severe neurologic disease. The risk for mosquito-transmitted infections is present from when snow melts in the spring until there is a mosquito killing frost in the fall."

JCV is a mosquitoborne pathogen that circulates widely in North America primarily between deer and mosquitoes but can also infect humans. In addition to JCV, eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) and West Nile virus (WNV) circulate when mosquitoes are actively biting.

People can be infected with [any of the] 3 mosquitoborne diseases and not develop any symptoms, or only develop very mild symptoms. Early symptoms can include fever, muscle aches, headaches, and fatigue. More serious central nervous system disease, including meningitis or encephalitis, can occur with these diseases. If you or someone you know is experiencing symptoms, including fever and headache, contact your local medical provider.

Reports of JCV in humans have been increasing over the last several years as recognition and testing for this virus has increased. This is New Hampshire's 14th case of JCV since the 1st report of the disease in the state in 2013. Many illnesses caused by JCV are mild, but moderate-to-severe central nervous system involvement requiring hospitalization have been reported, including fatal infections. In NH, human cases of JCV have been recorded as early as mid-May and as late as early November.

[This is now the 5th Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV) case in New Hampshire this year (2020). As noted above, JCV cases are not new in New Hampshire. They were diagnosed in the state last year (2019) and in 2013, 2017, and 2018. JCV infections are extremely rare, and, if laboratory confirmed, the 2018 case was the 1st documented death due to the virus (see Jamestown Canyon virus - USA: (NH) fatal, susp 20180629.5882078).

As noted in previous ProMED posts, JCV was first isolated from a pool of 9 _Culiseta inornata_ mosquitoes captured in Jamestown Canyon, Colorado, in 1961 and later shown to be widely distributed in the eastern and midwestern USA. Boreal (northern) aedes and ochlerotatus mosquitoes are the primary vectors. As with the other California serogroup orthobunyaviruses, transovarial virus transmission is common, with newly emerging female mosquitoes already infected with the virus in the spring and ready to transmit it. White-tailed deer, _Odocoileus virginianus_, are the principal amplification hosts.

As Drs Charles Calisher and Paul Grimstad pointed out in ProMED archive no. 20040807.2171, JCV frequently seems to be forgotten as an etiological agent of human disease. The previous report provided related references. - Mod.TY
