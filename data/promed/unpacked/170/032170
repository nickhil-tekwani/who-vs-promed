Rift Valley fever in Sudan - WHO update 4
-----------------------------------------
Human cases of Rift Valley fever (RVF) continue to occur in Sudan. As of
Wed 19 Dec 2007, a total of 601 human RVF cases, including 211 deaths, have
been reported from White Nile, Sennar, Gazeera, and River Nile States. In
addition, 31 cases including 7 deaths were reported in Khartoum State, but
they are believed to have acquired the infection in the other affected
areas. Gazeera State continues to report the most human cases and now
accounts for 406 cases and 148 deaths.
In RVF outbreaks, the vast majority of human infections result from direct
or indirect contact with the blood or organs of infected animals. The virus
can be transmitted to humans through the handling of animal tissue during
slaughtering or butchering, assisting with animal births, conducting
veterinary procedures, or from the disposal of carcasses or fetuses. Human
infections have also resulted from the bites of infected mosquitoes. Humans
may also become infected with RVF by ingesting the unpasteurized or
uncooked milk or meat of infected animals.
Continued integrated intensive social mobilization efforts are urgently
needed using all locally available media, including television and radio
channels, as well as community and religious leaders, to ensure that
at-risk communities are fully aware of the measures that need to be taken
to reduce the risk of human infection.
