An outbreak of measles in an orthodox Jewish community in Antwerp, Belgium,
2007-2008: different reasons for accumulation of susceptibles

From August 2007 to May 2008, an outbreak of at least 137 cases of measles
occurred in some orthodox Jewish communities in Antwerp, Belgium. The
outbreak was linked to outbreaks in the same communities in the United
Kingdom and in Israel. The reasons for this outbreak were diverse: cultural
factors, misinformation on vaccination by some medical doctors, and the
lack of a catch-up vaccination programme in private Jewish schools. The
identification of smaller susceptible groups for measles transmission and
vaccination of these groups represent a major challenge for the measles
elimination programme.

Introduction
------------
Outbreaks of measles have been described in several European countries in
2007 and 2008. Travelling played an important role in several of these
outbreaks. Roma populations and Irish travellers are some of the
susceptible groups for measles transmission. Other susceptible groups
identified in 2007 were orthodox Jewish communities [1,2]. These latter
communities were also affected in an outbreak of measles in Belgium that
occurred in Antwerp between August 2007 and May 2008 [3].

Measles vaccination in Belgium (trivalent measles-mumps-rubella (MMR)
vaccine) has been offered free of charge since 1985 through the routine
childhood immunisation programme (1st dose at the age of 12 months) and
through school health centres (2nd dose at the age of 10-13 years since
1995 and catch-up vaccination for both doses). Following the introduction
of routine immunisation, the incidence of measles in Belgium has decreased
from 998 cases per 100 000 inhabitants in 1982 to 6 cases per 100 000 in
1999 [4]. The national incidence of measles in Belgium in 2006 was
estimated at between 5 and 10 cases per million inhabitants [0.5-1/100 000.
- Mod.SH], based on data reported by a voluntary surveillance network of
paediatricians and general practitioners (GPs), a laboratory network, and
mandatory notification of measles cases in schools [5].

Overall vaccine coverage for the 1st dose of measles vaccine (MMR1) in
Antwerp is 94 per cent, according to a vaccine coverage study in children
aged 18-24 months in 2005 [6]. Separate information on measles vaccine
coverage in particular groups such as Jewish communities in Belgium is not
available.

Antwerp is home to several Jewish communities, all residing in the same
part of town. Orthodox Jewish communities are very isolated, with children
going to Jewish schools. In October 2007, a school health service in
Antwerp reported several suspected cases of measles in 2 Jewish schools in
the city. The objectives of this study were to describe the outbreak and to
identify reasons for non-vaccination and accumulation of susceptible
communities in Antwerp, in order to implement control measures and prevent
outbreaks in the future.

Methods
-------
Investigation of the cluster was carried out by the Public Health
Surveillance of Flanders, in collaboration with the Scientific Institute of
Public Health (IPH). Cases were reported by school health services in
Antwerp (mandatory notification), by paediatricians and GPs (voluntary
notification), through the Jewish communities (after an awareness
campaign), and by the national laboratory for measles and rubella (IPH).

All cases that met with the clinical case definition of measles (rash and
fever and at least one of the following symptoms: coryza, cough, or
conjunctivitis) and were either member of a Jewish community or had an
epidemiological link with a case associated with the outbreak, were
included. The diagnosis of measles was confirmed on saliva and
nasopharyngeal samples (IgM and/or PCR) on as many cases as possible.
Genotyping was performed by the national laboratory for measles and rubella
(IPH) and the World Health Organization (WHO) regional reference laboratory
in Luxembourg.

Epidemiological data were collected through a structured questionnaire,
administered by the outbreak investigation team to cases or their parents,
during a house visit or a phone interview. Patients or their parents were
questioned on demographical data, clinical data, contact with other
patients, stay abroad, and vaccination status (validated when possible by
vaccination card). The electronic vaccination database of Flanders
(Vaccinnet) was used to complete missing information on the vaccination
status (for all cases).

Results
-------
At least 137 cases of measles were identified in this outbreak between
August 2007 and May 2008. The questionnaire was filled in for 128 cases (93
per cent). Epidemiological investigation indicated that the 2 1st cases of
measles, 2 children belonging to an orthodox Jewish community, had attended
a summer camp in the United Kingdom (UK). Both fell ill on their return.
Further spread among ultra-orthodox Jewish communities may have been
reinforced at different moments, as the outbreak points out, with possible
re-importation of the virus from the UK and from Israel.

Almost all cases of the outbreak (96 per cent) lived in the same
neighbourhood in Antwerp, and 129 cases (94 per cent) belonged to orthodox
Jewish communities. The majority of cases (81 per cent) were under 10 years
of age. Of the 16 children that were under 12 months of age, 3 (19 per
cent) were between 3 and 6 months old, 7 (44 per cent) were 6-9 months old
and 6 (37 per cent) were 9-11 months old. 2 children (one 4 and one 11
months old) were infected by their mother [4 months and 11 months and
different mothers, or 4 years and 11 months, and possibly the same mother?
- Mod.SH]. Half of the non-Jewish cases were adults. 71 of 135 cases (for
whom sex was known) were male. Complications (otitis, bronchitis,
pneumonia) occurred in 14 per cent of cases and 7 per cent were
hospitalised (n=130 for whom the information was available). The diagnosis
of measles was confirmed for 27 per cent of cases. Genotyping was performed
on 25 samples. The virus isolated was of genotype D4.

Data on vaccination status were collected for 129 measles cases (94 per
cent), of whom 28 children (22 per cent) were vaccinated with one dose of
measles containing vaccine, according to their parents. However, this
information could only be validated for 15 children (12 per cent). Of the
101 unvaccinated cases (according to the parents), 78 (77 per cent) were
eligible for vaccination according to their age.

For 69 (88 per cent) of these cases, information on the reason for
non-vaccination could be collected. Reported reasons were: 'on advice of
the GP or paediatrician' for 26 cases (38 per cent), 'by omission' for 18
cases (26 per cent), and 'out of fear of side-effects, allergy or frequent
disease in childhood' for 16 children (23 per cent). Opposition to
vaccination as reason for non-vaccination was reported for only 9 cases (13
per cent), representing 3 families (5 per cent of all Jewish families
involved in the outbreak). 56 per cent of the non-vaccinated eligible cases
were patients of the same GP, known to be opposed to vaccination. None of
the families mentioned religious beliefs as reason for non-vaccination.

Control measures
----------------
Awareness among the Jewish communities was raised through publications in a
local paper (in Yiddish and in Flemish), with the help of Jewish doctors,
rabbis, and a Jewish health organisation. GPs and paediatricians in Antwerp
were informed about the outbreak and invited to perform laboratory testing
(on saliva) for confirmation of the diagnosis in suspected measles cases,
to report the cases to the division of infectious disease control of at the
Public Health Surveillance of Flanders and to check the measles vaccination
status of all patients.

In response to the notification of the 1st measles cases in October 2007,
vaccination was offered by the school health service to non-vaccinated
children in the 2 affected subsidised Jewish schools in Antwerp. As the
epidemic continued in spring 2008, a 2nd vaccination campaign was carried
out in May 2008 in all subsidised Jewish schools. Setting up a catch-up
vaccination campaign in private Jewish schools was more difficult and time
consuming, and took place in June 2008. Although no recent cases had been
identified, about 500 school aged children were vaccinated, to avoid new
import of measles during the summer holidays by the remaining susceptible
children.

Discussion
----------
Similar to other culturally closed communities such as Roma and Irish
travellers, orthodox Jewish communities belong to the group of
hard-to-reach populations identified in Europe, as contact with "outsiders"
is regarded with suspicion. Building up contact with representatives of
these communities took time, but once established, investigation and
control activities were carried out with their support.

As measles is not a mandatorily notifiable disease, some doctors refused to
report cases. It is therefore likely that some cases were not identified.
Nevertheless, active case finding through house visits allowed the
description of the outbreak, and parents of cases collaborated well, which
resulted in a high response rate to the questionnaires.

The virus strain circulating in Antwerp (D4) was of the identical genotype
as the strain responsible for the outbreak in Jewish communities in the UK
[1] and in Israel [2]. Although D4 strains have recently been implicated in
major outbreaks in Europe [7,8] and information on circulating genotypes in
Belgium or Antwerp before the outbreak is not available, it is most
probable that the virus was imported from the UK.

Transmission of the virus within the Jewish communities occurred mainly at
school, with further spread to the non-protected younger siblings at home.
The high MMR1 coverage in the general population and the socially isolated
way of life of ultra-orthodox Jewish communities avoided spread of the
outbreak to the whole town or country. In total, only 8 non-Jewish
individuals were infected with measles during this outbreak. Except for 2
vaccinated children, the affected non-Jewish cases were either too young or
too old to have taken part in the routine vaccination programme.
Transmission to non-Jewish individuals occurred in the neighbourhood,
through work or in the waiting room for paediatric consultation at a
hospital in the area. Non-Jewish adult cases were initially diagnosed as
having an allergic rash in response to antibiotics prescribed for a
supposed respiratory tract infection.

The outbreak investigation highlighted that there were no religious reasons
for opposition to vaccination. Similar to findings of a qualitative study
among the orthodox Jewish community in London, many families had partially
immunised their children [9]. Cultural factors (routine vaccination
schedule started later and with a longer interval between vaccines, large
families with omission of vaccination for one or 2 children) and lack of
information or misperception of possible side effects or interaction with
other diseases were important reasons why children did not get a 1st dose
of MMR vaccine during their childhood. In subsidised schools where
follow-up of health and vaccination status is provided by public health
services of school medicine, catch-up vaccination is offered to the
children at each of their regular consultation appointments (every 2-3
years). Pupils of private schools that do not have a school health service
are not offered (catch-up) vaccination and have to rely on their
paediatricians and GPs for information on vaccines and for vaccination
itself. The investigation revealed that 2 physicians in Antwerp, known to
serve a high proportion of the orthodox Jewish communities, are advising
mothers not to vaccinate their children. Within families, the index case of
measles was generally infected at (primary) school. Early catch-up
vaccination for the 1st dose of MMR in schools, and systematically offering
the 2nd dose of MMR, not only in subsidised schools but also in private
schools might have avoided this outbreak.

Because of the outbreak and the vaccination campaigns, we can expect that
all the individuals that had been susceptible to measles in these
communities are now protected -- through natural disease or vaccination. To
avoid new accumulation of susceptibles, an agreement must be found to offer
the routine childhood vaccines to pupils of private schools that do not yet
have a school health service.

Conclusion
----------
Very diverse reasons have led to an accumulation of people susceptible to
measles within part of the population in the centre of Antwerp. The nature
of social behaviour in Jewish communities, with frequent travelling and
lots of international contacts, led to the importation of measles among
these susceptibles, leading to an outbreak of at least 137 cases.

The orthodox Jewish communities were previously not identified as a risk
group for measles transmission in Belgium. Other unidentified groups may exist.

The identification of smaller susceptible groups for measles transmission
and systematic vaccination of these groups represent a major challenge for
the measles elimination programme in Europe.

[This retrospective analysis of a measles outbreak in Antwerp, Belgium, in
2007-2008 revealed a number of contributory factors. The outbreak affected
almost exclusively communiies of orthodox Jews in the city, although these
communities had no religious reasons for opposition to vaccination. The
accumulation of susceptible in these communities was a consequence of
social isolation and lack of provision of routine childhood vaccines to
pupils of private schools that did not yet have a school health service. A
more unusual feature was the revelation that 2 physicians in Antwerp, known
to serve a high proportion of the orthodox Jewish communities, were
advising mothers not to vaccinate their children.
