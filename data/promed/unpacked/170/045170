Saudi Arabia has sent frozen samples of dead camels to France to try
to discover why dozens are dying each day, along with cattle and
sheep, newspapers said on Wednesday [29 Aug 2007].
Al-Watan newspaper said 60 more camels died on Tuesday [28 Aug 2007]
as well as 400 sheep and 7 cows. There was no official confirmation
of the figures.
The camel samples were sent on Tuesday [28 Aug 2007], as Saudi
officials came under increasing criticism by owners of herds for not
acting more quickly to try to determine ways to tackle the problem.
On 25 Aug 2007, some 2 weeks after the beasts began to die,
Agriculture Minister Fahd bin Abdel-Rahman Balghnaim said nearly 2000
camels had died. "It is not because of an infectious disease. These
were cases of poisoning," the minister was quoted as saying by the
SPA state news agency.
Balghnaim said the animals were fed bran that had been bought from
traders whose bran stocks were contaminated. He put the final number
of dead camels in recent weeks at 1982.
Laboratory research was being carried out to reveal exactly what was
wrong with the animal feed, he said at the time.
According to figures in the Saudi press, at least 5000 camels have
now died and thousands more are sick. Official figures put the total
number of camels in the kingdom in 2005 at 862 000.
Just before the camels began to die, newspapers had reported an
outbreak of foot-&-mouth disease [FMD] -- which can also affect
camels -- in the kingdom. [FMD is generally regarded to be
subclinical in camels; its role in the syndrome described above seems
most unlikely. - Mod.AS]

A senior Health Ministry official yesterday [29 Aug 2007] blamed
poisonous chemicals for the death of more than 2000 camels in
different parts of the country. The official also warned the public
against eating the meat of sick camels before determining the reason
for the disease in these camels.
"According to available information the camels died of poisonous
chemicals. As the chemicals cannot be removed by cooking, it is
dangerous to eat the meat of affected camels," Falah Al-Mazroue,
director of preventive medicine at the ministry, told Al-Watan Arabic daily.
The Ministry of Agriculture has sent frozen samples of dead camels to
France to try to discover the reason for their death.
On 25 Aug 2007, some 2 weeks after the animals began to die,
Agriculture Minister Fahd Balghnaim said nearly 2000 camels had died.
"It is not because of any infectious disease. These were cases of
poisoning," the minister told reporters in Riyadh.
Balghnaim said the animals were fed bran that had been bought from
traders whose bran stocks were contaminated. He put the final number
of dead camels in recent weeks at 1982. Laboratory tests were being
carried out to reveal exactly what was wrong with the animal feed, he
said at the time.
According to figures reported in the Saudi press, at least 5000
camels have now died and thousands more are sick.
Officials of the Commission for Supervision and Investigation will
tour the areas where camel deaths were reported to make a field
assessment of the problem and review the measures taken by the
Agriculture Ministry to address the situation. "We will take the
assistance of experts in testing samples of fodder that was present
in the market during the time of camel deaths," the commission said
in a statement carried by the Saudi Press Agency. The commission
will also check the measures taken by municipalities to dispose of dead camels.
The increasing deaths of camels have sent shockwaves among limited
income farmers who depend on these animals for their daily bread. In
order to compensate their losses, Prince Abdul Rahman, deputy
minister of defense and aviation, donated 300 of his camels. Riyadh
Gov. Prince Salman, meanwhile, instructed officials to postpone a
camel contest in Wadi Al-Dawasser following the death of several
camels in the region in recent weeks.

[Mass-mortality in camels has been, reportedly, observed in Saudi
Arabia since 13 Aug 2007 or earlier. Its etiology, unfortunately
still obscure, was initially suspected to be fodder poisoning. The
issue has recently led to diminished sales of camel meat in the
Kingdom, due to (apparently justifiable) growing consumer concern,
since animal breeders -- in Saudi Arabia as elsewhere -- are expected
to try get rid of their food-animals before they show signs of
disease, be it infectious or otherwise.
This is the 1st time cattle and sheep, not only camels, are mentioned
in the media as being (possibly) affected. A coincidence? A common
fodder source? A common infection?
An official statement from the Saudi authorities on the
investigations so far and on the consumer-health protection measures
undertaken, is anticipated. Any available test results (positive or
negative) from laboratories in Saudi Arabia, France, or elsewhere,
will be welcomed. - Mod. AS]
