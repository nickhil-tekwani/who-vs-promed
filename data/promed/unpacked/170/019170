A 55-year-old woman, resident of the Paris de Parita neighborhood, Herrera province, became the 2nd case of [a] hantavirus] infection in the region so far in 2014. She was ordered to be taken to the intensive care unit of Santo Tomas Hospital in the capital city [Panama City].

The patient was admitted to the Cecilio A. Castillero Hospital in Chitre with symptoms including 6 febrile days, headache, muscle and back pain and was later moved on 8 Dec [2014] to Panama City. The Herrera Regional Health Director, Alcibiades Dominguez, confirmed that the patient remains with a reserved prognosis and added that [field] investigations were being carried out and [rodent] traps placed.

[These cases have all occurred in the same general area, in the Azuero peninsula region. Most cases this year (2014) have occurred in neighboring Los Santos province.

Although not specified in the report above, or in the previous ones, the hantavirus most likely involved is Choclo virus, since it is the only hantavirus known to cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome with hospitalizations in Panama. The number of reported cases of Choclo virus infection in Los Santos province continues to increase, and now there are 2 cases in Herrera province. The Azuero region is endemic for Choclo virus, and several cases this year (2014) and in the past have come from there. The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg.

There is concern about the small trash deposits that the locality generates that promote the proliferation of rodents.

The General Director of the Eva Peron in Hipolito Yrigoyen, Dr. Enrique Medina, confirmed the occurrence of a case of a hantavirus [infection] in that locality in the past 10 days.

Medina stated, moreover, that there is another case for which confirmation is awaited, both [cases] in the Hipolito Yrigoyen locale.

The 1st case affected a middle-aged teacher, and, according what the physician said, this patient overcame the acute phase and is recuperating favorably.

The 2nd [case], although awaiting confirmation, is by all indications with symptoms that are highly compatible with and indicate the [same] disease. That patient, who is a rural worker, is hospitalized currently in a private clinic in San Ramon of Nueva Oran.

Obviously, this situation places everyone in the health system in the locality on alert. From the epidemiological point of view, they are working to take all the collections that the disease requires.

"We are going to hold a meeting with the APS [primary health care providers] to determine the epidemiological follow up [to be taken] with patients and family members to corroborate where the virus was contracted," explained the hospital director.

According to statistical data, in 2014, a hantavirus [infection] case was confirmed, and confirmation of the 2nd one is awaited. "Epidemiologically, we anticipate 4 cases based on the statistics from recent years," said Medina.

It is recalled that last year [2013], this disease caused the death of a 12-year-old girl in this city.

"We are not afraid; we are very careful. Go to the hospital and ask for related information. If you go to a rural area, avoid places where there is trash or abandoned camps where food might have remained that the rodents might have eaten," suggested the professional.

Concluding, Medina said, "This is also generated by bad habits; there is trash on all sides, and this attracts rodents, and it is caused by irresponsible people. Trash anywhere is an attack on health."

On the other hand, the official story that the hospital publicized in social networks [stated], "We take care of environmental sanitation; when a febrile syndrome appears, go for healthcare with urgency."

[It would be of interest to know the species of rodents and the specific hantavirus involved in this situation. The hantavirus involved in this case is not identified, and ProMED would be interested in knowing whether a specific virus is laboratory identified.

Cases of hantavirus infections were reported from various parts of Argentina over the past 3 years (2012, 2013, and 2014). As noted in ProMED-mail archive no. 20110430.1348, several endemic hantaviruses have been associated with human infection in Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Lechiguana (in central Argentina in the yellow pygmy rice rat _O. flavescens_); Oran (in northwestern Argentina in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat _O. longicaudatus_); and Bermejo (western Argentina in _O. flavescens_). Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved. Andes virus seems unlikely in this case, but this case in the Oran area in Salta province may have been caused by Lechiguana virus infection.

An image of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat, _O. longicaudatus_, is available at http://www.hantavirus.cl/educacion_prevencion/galeria_reservorio.htm.
