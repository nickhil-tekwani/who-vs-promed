1st Report of Anthracnose Caused by _Elsinoe ampelina_ on Grapes in Michigan.
A. M. C. Schilder, S. M. Smokevitch, M. Catal, and W. K. Mann,
Department of Plant Pathology, Michigan State University, East
Lansing 48824. Plant Dis. 89:1011, 2005; published on-line as DOI:
10.1094/PD-89-1011A. Accepted for publication 24 Jun 2005.
In 2001, dark brown-to-purple, sunken lesions were observed on shoots
and berries of 5-year-old 'Mars' and 'Marquis' table grapes (_Vitis_
spp.) in Onondaga, MI. The disease affected >90 percent of the vines.
Many leaves were curled and distorted and some shoot tips had died
back. Older wood showed crater-like indentations. No fruit was
harvested due to poor fruit quality.
Lesions (at least 10 per sample) were surface-disinfested with 1
percent sodium hypochlorite, placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA),
and kept at 23 to 25 deg C under ambient light. _Sphaceloma
ampelinum_ de Bary (teleomorph _Elsinoe ampelina_ Shear) was isolated
from shoots, leaves, and clusters (4). Colonies appeared as
slow-growing, dark red mounds. Conidia were hyaline, ovoid, and
measured 2.5 to 5 x 5 to 12.5 micrometers (average 3.5 x 7.4
micrometers).
While grape anthracnose is usually considered a southern disease,
occasional outbreaks have been reported in Ohio (1) and it appears to
have become more common in Michigan in recent years. Several old
herbarium specimens and records of the fungus on grapes in Michigan
exist (2,3), but pathogenicity was not proven.
In 2004, the disease was confirmed in 8 table-grape vineyards (3
'Marquis', 2 'Concord Seedless', 2 'Mars', and one unknown variety),
one juice grape ('Niagara'), and one wine grape vineyard ('Vidal') in
various locations in Michigan.
To determine pathogenicity, shoots of 2 potted 'Mars' plants were
sprayed until runoff with a suspension of 1 million conidia/ml of an
isolate from 'Marquis' grapes in Lawton, MI. The plants were covered
with clear plastic bags for 48 h and kept at 23 to 25 deg C on the
lab bench for 2 weeks. Shoots sprayed with water served as controls.
After 4 days, numerous brown spots appeared on inoculated young
leaves, petioles, internodes, and tendrils. Lesions continued to
enlarge and coalesce into large necrotic areas. The fungus was
successfully reisolated on PDA using the procedure described above.
ITS1F/ITS4 amplification of 3 isolates from 'Marquis' vineyards in
St. Joseph, Lawton, and Onondaga, MI produced a product of
approximately 1040 bp. The sequences most closely matched that of _E.
banksiae_ I. Pascoe & P Crous from _Banksia prionotes_ Lindl. in
GenBank, but no _E. ampelina_ sequences were available for
comparison. The sequences of the 3 isolates in this study were
submitted to GenBank (Accession Nos. AY826762, AY826763, and
AY826764).
The disease in the vineyard in Onondaga may have been present on the
plants, which originated in Arkansas. Additional evidence for nursery
stock as a source of inoculum was the discovery of anthracnose on
'Concord Seedless' plants at a retailer in Okemos, MI in 2004.
Anthracnose was also found on riverbank grape (_Vitis riparia_
Michx.) in Holland, MI, indicating the potential of wild hosts to be
an inoculum source. However, nothing is known about the ability of
isolates from wild grapes to infect cultivated grapes. Control
methods, such as the use of disease-free plants, pruning, and
effective fungicides are necessary to avoid serious losses in
susceptible varieties, particularly in years with heavy rainfall.

[The grape anthracnose fungus, _Elsinoe ampelina_, overwinters in
infected plant material. In the spring when the temperature is at
least 2.2 deg C, spores are spread by wind and splashing rain and can
infect all aboveground parts of the plant. However, warmer conditions
(up to 32.2 deg C) promote more severe infections. The primary winter
survival mode for the fungus is in mummified berries and in other
infected plant material. Management of grape anthracnose disease
consists of the following procedures: 1) pruning and destroying
diseased plant material while they are dormant to reduce the
potential for disease in the following year; 2) removing wild grapes
in the vicinity because they can harbor pathogens; 3) avoiding
planting anthracnose-susceptible grape cultivars; 4) and promoting
drying of the canopy by pruning, training, row orientation, and
proper spacing. Grapes in New Zealand are treated with regular
dormant and regular fungicide sprays during the season.
