Low pathogenic avian influenza (poultry), Chile
-----------------------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 6 Jan 2017 from Dr Jose Ignacio Gomez Meza, Jefe de la Division de Proteccion Pecuaria, Servicio Agricola y Ganadero (SAG), Ministerio de Agricultura, Santiago, Chile

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 26 Dec 2016
Date of confirmation of the event: 6 Jan 2017
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence of a listed disease in the country
Causal agent: low pathogenic avian influenza virus
Serotype: H7
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Las Palmas, Marga Marga, Valparaiso
Date of start of the outbreak: 26 Dec 2016
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed
Birds / 344 540 / 5534 / 5534 / 339 006 / 0
Affected population: The outbreak is contained to the farm Las Palmas, which is composed of 8 sectors of turkeys for fattening.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]:
Species / morbidity rate / mortality rate / case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Birds / 1.61 / 1.61 / 100 / 100
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: Stamping out has been applied to the entire susceptible population. The Official Veterinary Service of Chile maintains the whole production system under strict official control and additional monitoring and control measures have been implemented in the area adjacent to the outbreak.

Control measures
Measures applied: disinfection/disinfestation; traceability; quarantine; surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; stamping out; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; control of wildlife reservoirs; zoning; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Official Laboratory Lo Aguirre (national laboratory) / Birds / reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 30 Dec 2016 / Positive
National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL), United States of America (OIE reference laboratory) / Birds / virus sequencing / 6 Jan 2017 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[The following information was obtained from a publication titled "Avian Influenza in Chile: A Successful Experience": "Avian influenza (AI) was diagnosed in May 2002 for the 1st time in Chile and South America. The epidemic was caused by the highly pathogenic AI (HPAI) virus subtype H7N3 that emerged from a low pathogenic virus. The index farm was a broiler breeder, located in San Antonio, V Region, which at the time was a densely populated poultry area. Stamping of 465 000 breeders, in 27 sheds, was immediately conducted. Surveillance activities detected a 2nd outbreak, 1 week later, at a turkey breeding farm from the same company. The 2nd farm was located 4 km [2.5 mi] from the index case. Only 25 percent of the sheds were infected, and 18 500 turkeys were destroyed. In both outbreaks, surveillance zones and across-country control measures were established: pre-diagnosis quarantine, depopulation, intensive surveillance, movement control, and increased biosecurity. Other measures included cleaning, disinfection, and controlling the farms with sentinels to detect the potential presence of the virus. Zoning procedures were implemented to allow the international trade of poultry products from unaffected areas. Positive serologic results to H5N2 virus also were detected in other poultry farms, but there was no evidence of clinical signs or virus isolation. Epidemiological investigation and laboratory confirmation determined that positive serology was related to a contaminated imported batch of vaccine against inclusion body hepatitis. All actions taken allowed the control of the epidemic, and within 7 months, Chile was free of AI. Epidemic and control measures that prevented further spread are described in this article, which illustrates the importance of a combination of control measures during and after an outbreak of AI. This study is a good example of how veterinary services need to respond if their country is affected by HPAI".

According to a press release issued by the Agriculture and Livestock Services on 6 Jan 2017: "The avian influenza virus that was detected from a samples taken from a commercial turkey flock in the municipality of Quilpu√© [Marga Marga province, Valparaiso] is of low pathogenicity, which presents a lower risk for animal health. The results confirm that Chile continues to be a country having high animal health standards, thus allowing the trade of Chilean livestock products to continue to flow to those countries to which it exports. For markets temporarily closed to Chilean poultry meat, there is a normal procedure which ensures that such markets will be re-opened in the short term." http://www.sag.cl/noticias/resultados-oficiales-de-chile-y-eeuu-confirman-baja-patogenicidad-de-virus-de-influenza-aviar [in Spanish].

Low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) occurs naturally in wild birds and can spread to domestic birds.

Avian influenza viruses are divided by subtypes based on 2 proteins found in the viruses: a hemagglutinin, or "H" protein, and a neuraminidase, or "N" protein. There are 16 H types and 9 N types yielding a total 144 possible combinations.

The H5 and H7 subtypes are of particular concern, given the ability of these 2 H-types to mutate from low pathogenic to highly pathogenic strains. These 2 H-types have been known to cause serious disease and mortality in domestic poultry (http://www.inspection.gc.ca/animals/terrestrial-animals/diseases/reportable/ai/fact-sheet/eng/1356193731667/1356193918453).

The results regarding the N type involved in this current event are still pending. - Mod.CRD
