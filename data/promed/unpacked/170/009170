Mysterious disease claims 19 lives
--------------------------------------------
A mysterious disease is reported to have claimed 19 lives in two villages
Bichhu and Dwargarh, of Jaunpur block of Tehri Garhwal district, and many
are believed to be in the grip of this epidemic, which has hit the hilly
areas last week.
Due to inaccessibility of these far-flung villages, some 45 km from
Mussoorie and 100 km from the new Tehri town, medical teams could not reach
the affected areas on time. [A Few deaths are attributed to this delay and
some of them are admitted to hospitals in Mussoorie in a serious condition.
"The affected victims were vomiting profusely with symptoms of diarrhoea,"
says a report.
The report quoting the chief medical officer of Tehri Garhwal M.S. Kunwar
says, the potable water flowing into the villages was contaminated due to
the carcass of a dead animal with some poisonous substance.
It further stated that the panic- stricken villagers have begun fleeing the
area. The two villages, Bichhu and Dwargarh, have some 105 and 60 families
residing there.
A four-member medical team is understood to be posted in the villages to
provide necessary medicare to the affected victims.
