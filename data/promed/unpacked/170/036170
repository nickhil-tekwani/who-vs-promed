[The 2 newly reported cases were in Lanarkshire. Last Mon 24 May 2010
was the Whitsun Bank Holiday and new cases are therefore not
unexpected though this series of cases is stretching out and out. If
they continue as they are doing, one may begin to speculate that
possibly the Scottish authorities are having to deal with more than
one contaminated batch of heroin. But then one would ask, "Why
Scotland?"
