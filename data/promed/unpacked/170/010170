"About 9000 Americans die every year from food poisoning..." AP 12-17-97
I would refer you to the May/June issue of the Columbia Journalism Review
for an article on page 16 "Food Poisonings' Phoney Figure." This article
addresses the figure of 9000 annual deaths from food poisoning being a
bogus estimate from the Council for Agricultural Science and Technology.
The number comes from a mathematical model that was not based on known
cases. (A second mathematical model produced the estimate of 523 annual
deaths from food poisoning.)

It might be old news by now, but for those interested in foodborne disease
and the factors contributing to its occurrence, I would highly recommend the
book "SPOILED: The Dangerous Truth About a Food Chain Gone Haywire" by
Nicols Fox, published by Basic Books, copyright 1997.
I have found it readable, well-documented, and an excellent introduction to
human manipulation of food and the environment, both of which have led to an
increase in foodborne outbreaks of disease.

[I suspect that this subject has received as much attention as it deserves
at this time, so the thread is cut. Thanks. - Mod.MHJ
