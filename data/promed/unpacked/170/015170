Viet Nam has recorded 42 181 cases of dengue fever nationwide as of
October [2011], including 44 fatalities, according to the Preventive
Medicine Department.

Tran Thanh Duong, vice head of the department, said that cases of
infection and the number of fatalities have declined from the same
period of 2010, and no epidemic hot spots have been detected.

Some cities and provinces saw an increase of the disease, namely Ca
Mau, Ho Chi Minh City, Dong Nai, Binh Duong, Binh Phuoc, Tay Ninh, Bac
Lieu, Hanoi, and Binh Thuan.

There was also a rise in the number of patients hospitalized for this
disease at the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases.

The hospital director, Nguyen Van Kinh, said that each day it receives
3-4 serious cases of dengue fever. The hospital, he said, has treated
more than 600 patients of this disease since early 2011; none of them
died. Most of these patients were transferred from provinces
nationwide.

Dengue fever is periodic and often occurs in the Mekong Delta.
