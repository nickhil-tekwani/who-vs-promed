Bluetongue, Spain
-----------------------
The information regarding the Bluetongue epidemic in Spain is
scant in the regional press and almost absent from the major
national newspapers.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Ministerio de
Agricultura, Pesca y Alimentacion, MAPA) has a website with
information about the BT epidemic.
<http://rasve.mapya.es/Publica/Noticias/LenguaAzul/Focos_Lengua
Azul.asp>
The following data are derived from the aforesaid website.
Briefly, the evolution during the last 2 weeks has been as follows:
Up to 11 Nov 2004: 117 outbreaks (Andalucia 95, Extremadura 22)
Up to 16 Nov 2004: 174 outbreaks (Andalucia 136, Extremadura
38)
Up to 25 Nov 2004: 201 outbreaks (Andalucia 161, Extremadura
38, Ceuta 2)
The breakdown in the 3 regions was as follows:
Andalucia: 161 Outbreaks in 3 provinces
-- Malaga (35, in 12 municipalities)
-- Huelva (3, in one municipality) and
--Cadiz (123, in 23 municipalities).
Extremadura: 38 Outbreaks in 2 provinces
-- Caceres (24 outbreaks in 7 municipalities) and
-- Badajoz (14 outbreaks in 5 municipalities).
Ceuta: 2 Outbreaks (Ceuta is situated on the African continent, and
borders Morocco).
A map depicting the general distribution of outbreaks and restriction
zones can be seen at
<http://rasve.mapya.es/Publica/Noticias/Ficheros/municipios%20af
ectados.jpg>
Extracts from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food PDF
report posted on the website follow:
"The main hypothesis regarding the origin of the epidemic is that it
originated in Morocco (the Gibraltar strait is only 14 km wide).
The BT virus serotype 4 is the same for both countries. Weather
charts elaborated in Spain and in the OIE Orbivirus Reference
Laboratory (Institute for Animal Health, UK) depict a regular
movement of air masses through the summer from Morocco to
Spain.
The Ministry's report also says that animals originating from the
affected zones have been detected in Salamanca, Murcia, Ciudad
Real, Cuenca, Avila, Zamora and Valencia. These areas cover
most of the centre, north and south-east of peninsular Spain. In
these areas all in-contact animals have been tested twice at 2
weeks intervals by ELISA and RT-PCR and all found negative.
Only severely affected animals are destroyed and [such decisions
are] based on humane grounds. Morbidity is around 50 percent and
mortality at 5 percent on average. In some outbreaks, a 30
percent mortality has been registered. Main clinical signs are
lameness, fever and facial edema.
3 areas have been demarcated around the outbreaks: a restricted
zone, protection zone and free-of-restrictions zone. However, the
website does not provide definitions of the zones.
There is a detailed description of the regular serological and
mosquito surveillance system established for the whole country
before the outbreak.

[This is a significant addition to the information available so far on
this major outbreak, for which Pablo Nart is gratefully
acknowledged. The affected area in Spain covers vast areas in the
south and southwestern parts of the Iberian peninsula; it is
therefore not surprising that the disease has now been reported
from Portugal as well (see a separate OIE emergency notification).
This seems to be the 1st publication of BTV4 as the serotype
responsible for this major outbreak. Morocco reported in October
2004 the identification of BTV4 as the causative agent of the
current outbreak there. Readers are referred to the recent review
of USDA's Veterinary Services (Center for Emerging Issues) on
Bluetongue in the Mediterranean Basin:

dBasin_EDNotice_Sep_04.htm>.
Further details on the Spanish and Portuguese BT situation,
especially regarding the susceptibility of different sheep breeds, will
be of interest. - Mod.AS]
