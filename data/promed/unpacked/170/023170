Soy rust shows up in 81 Brazil test farms - Embrapa
-----------------------------------------------
The number of Brazilian municipalities that registered cases of Asian
soybean rust disease jumped to 81 from 51 in 6 days, the government's crop
research department Embrapa said on Tuesday [21 Dec 2004].
Embrapa said the fast-spreading fungus, which can reduce crop yields by as
much as 80 percent if left untreated, was detected on test farms in the
Federal District and in 8 producer states: Mato Grosso, Parana, Rio Grande
do Sul, Goias, Mato Grosso do Sul, Minas Gerais, Sao Paulo, and Maranhao.
"It is important that producers intensify the monitoring of their areas and
remain attentive to new information over rust outbreaks," Embrapa
researcher Ademir Henning said.
The disease becomes more prevalent as the crop season progresses. Planting
of the new crop has just been finished, and, as soy plants begin to flower
and form beans, they become more vulnerable to rust.
The number of commercial areas that have registered outbreaks of rust rose
to 27 on Tuesday [21 Dec 2004] from 19 last week, Embrapa said. Many
producers in the surrounding areas of registered cases of rust are spraying
preventive fungicide applications on their fields.
The disease caused losses of over 4.5 million tons in soybean output from
last year's [2003] crop and has been claiming greater losses every year
since it 1st appeared in South America in 2001.

[In the absence of any commercial cultivars that are resistant to soybean
rust (SR), farmers have only chemical fungicides for disease management.
Early diagnosis and treatment are critical for soybean rust management.
Currently, there is no effective resistance to _Phakopsora pachyrhizi_, the
fungus that causes SR. Availability of SR-resistant soybean varieties in
the U.S. is still many years away (5 to 7 years). The Canadian Food
Inspection Agency (CFIA), USDA and the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture and
Food (OMAF) are monitoring and assessing the extent of these infections and
the likely size of the impacted area. If this confirmation leads to an
over-wintering SR population in the southern US, SR spores could migrate in
a similar manner that wheat rust and common rust of corn are spread into
Canada from these regions and Mexico. The impact and potential losses will
vary from year to year and will depend upon factors such as initial
infection levels (mild versus severe), soybean crop stage, environmental
conditions, and timing of fungicide applications.
