A mysterious disease has affected nearly 300 date palm trees in the middle of a grove in Tozeur governorate, causing great fears for farmers.

The Regional Centre for Agricultural Research explained that this disease is not new. Its proliferation was the result of the excessive application of pesticide. A quantity of the liquid accumulated in the center of the trees, creating favourable conditions for fungi to grow. The centre took samples for diagnosis before technicians will clean the palms. An experimental treatment was carried out as a 1st step of disease control.

Date palm (_Phoenix dactylifera_) is cultivated in many hot, dry regions as a staple food source. Trees can live for more than 100 years. A large number of fungi and a number of other pathogens are known to affect the crop. Standing pools of watery liquid in the heart of palms, as mentioned above, would encourage growth of most fungal or bacterial pathogens.

There are also several diseases of unknown aetiology for this crop, including brittle leaf. In Tunisia, it is regarded as an emerging disease since the early 2000s, with presence in all date palm growing areas (see link below). Its cause is yet unknown, but a contagious pathogen is suspected; several disease-specific, small RNAs have been reported (for more information see ProMED post 20080919.2934). Disease foci are common in palm groves. It is possible that this is the disease referred to above.

Date palm production is facing serious problems worldwide, including lack of research, pests, and spread of diseases. Productivity of the crop has declined globally. Environmental stress factors may predispose the trees to pathogen attacks. Reliable diagnosis of pathogens affecting specific areas is needed to be able to design effective disease management strategies.
