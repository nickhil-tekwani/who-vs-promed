West and Central Africa: Weekly Regional Humanitarian Snapshot (16-22 Aug 2022)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On 12 Aug 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) was notified of an outbreak of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in Podor District, Saint-Louis region*, in the northwest. The 1st confirmed case is a 38-year-old woman who presented with fever, headache, fatigue, and hemorrhagic symptoms. She died on 7 Aug 2022 due to complications by the virus. A 2nd case who is a contact of the 1st one has been detected positive on 14 Aug 2022. The CCHF virus causes severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10 to 40%.

[*Saint-Louis is a city on the northwest coast of Senegal. It's known for its colonial architecture. The old town is on N'Dar Island, in the Senegal River. This island is linked to the mainland by the 1865 Faidherbe Bridge, designed by Gustave Eiffel. Place Faidherbe has well-preserved buildings, including the Governor's Palace and the neoclassical cathedral. The Mus√©e du CRDS exhibits historical artifacts and art.]

On 12 Aug 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) was notified of a confirmed outbreak of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) ongoing in Podor District, Saint-Louis region, Senegal.

The index case is a female patient aged 38 years who presented with fever, headache, myalgia, fatigue and hemorrhagic symptoms, and was detected through the VHF surveillance system.

The disease started on 20 Jul 2022; she consulted on 5 Aug 2022, was sampled on 6 Aug 2022 and died on 7 Aug 2022. There is an history of travel to Mauritania on 2 Jul 2022. A 2nd case who is a contact of the index case has been confirmed positive on 14 Aug 2022.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is a widespread disease caused by a tick-borne virus (Nairovirus) of the Bunyaviridae family. The CCHF virus causes severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40%.

Animals become infected by the bite of infected ticks and the virus remains in their bloodstream for about one week after infection, allowing the tick-animal-tick cycle to continue when another tick bites. Although a number of tick genera are capable of becoming infected with CCHF virus, ticks of the genus _Hyalomma_ are the principal vector.

The CCHF virus is transmitted to people either by tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians. Human-to-human transmission is possible.

[CCHF can cause serious disease in humans, with a case fatality rate of 10-40%. It can be responsible for severe outbreaks in humans, but it is not pathogenic for ruminants, their amplifying hosts. WHO states that the onset of symptoms in humans is sudden, with fever, myalgia (muscle ache), dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, backache, headache, sore eyes and photophobia (sensitivity to light). There may be nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and sore throat early on, followed by sharp mood swings and confusion. After 2-4 days, the agitation may be replaced by sleepiness, depression, and lassitude, and the abdominal pain may localize to the upper right quadrant, with detectable hepatomegaly (liver enlargement). Other clinical signs include tachycardia (fast heart rate), lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes), and a petechial rash (a rash caused by bleeding into the skin) on internal mucosal surfaces, such as in the mouth and throat, and on the skin.

The disease now occurs sporadically throughout much of Africa, Asia, and Europe and results in an approximately 30% fatality rate. In West Africa, recurrent CCHF outbreaks have been constantly observed in Mauritania and Senegal. Moreover, acquisition and epidemiology of the infection in humans are correlated with the occurrence and seroprevalence of the virus in livestock, through various seroprevalence studies (https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03149974/).

Sporadic human infections may be expected in people with regular contact with livestock in endemic areas, but these are preventable through use of repellents, protective clothing, and gloves to prevent tick bites, and by avoiding contact with blood and body fluids of livestock.

To prevent outbreaks of CCHF, public awareness campaigns aimed at the populations most at risk -- livestock farmers, butchers, and health personnel -- must be conducted, and the epidemiologic alert systems must be strengthened. In addition, conditions that enhance maintenance of the virus in nature and its transmission to humans must be better understood so adequate control measures can be developed. - Mod.UBA
