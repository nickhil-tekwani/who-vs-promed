RABIES, QUARANTINE CHANGES - USA (HAWAII)
=========================================
[see
Rabies - UK: possible quarantine changes 961020202719

from The Economist, 23-30 May, 1997
On May 13th the Governor, Benjamin Cayetano, approved the plan to reduce the
quarantine for animals arriving in Hawaii from four months to 30 days. Under
the new rules, every animal entering the islands must (1) have been
vaccinated for rabies before it arrives; (2) it must also have had a blood
test for antibodies and a second test on arrival; and (3) carry a microchip
identification. It will be released from quarantine after thirty days if it
has shown no signs of rabies but must return for monthly testing for the
next three months. The old regime cost $620; the new will be around $200.
The changes followed a long campaign for change by the US Army.
ProMED readers will recognise that this new and enlightened plan mimics
those of Sweden and New Zealand. One can hope that the UK will follow suit.
