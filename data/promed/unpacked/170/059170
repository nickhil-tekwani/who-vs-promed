HEPATITIS A OUTBREAK IN A SOCIALLY-CONTAINED RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY IN RURAL
SOUTHERN ONTARIO
On 14 January 1997, a public-health unit in southern Ontario was alerted to
four possible cases of hepatitis A in one of its rural farming communities.
This [index] family of eight belonged to a socially-contained religious
community of approximately 6,000 people. Over the course of 4 months,
mid-December to mid-April, a total of 21 cases of hepatitis A were
identified within the religious community of the index family; 14 of these
were laboratory confirmed. Over one-third of the cases (8/21) were between
14 and 19 years of age. These cases were known to have participated in
weekly youth gatherings held at their homes for socializing and sharing
meals. The investigation established four generations of infection with
linkages back to the index family.
An immunization clinic was established on 17 January by the health unit, 5
days following the original investigation. Immune globulin (IG) was
administered to all persons potentially exposed to hepatitis A during the
previous 2 weeks. Initially, individuals were considered exposed contacts
if they were household family members of a case, had attended a meal with
one of the identified cases while he or she was infectious, had eaten food
prepared by an infectious case, or had slept over at the home of an
infectious case. The ill school teacher and all 28 students of the two-room
school attended by the children of the index family were also given IG. In
total, 125 contacts were given IG during this first response.
Ninety-six contacts were assessed to be too late to receive IG (2 weeks had
passed since exposure). All contacts were advised of symptoms and to alert
the health unit and/or their physician if any such symptoms occurred among
family members. Information was also given on appropriate hygienic
precautions to prevent the spread of disease.
It became apparent that many contacts were too late to receive IG by the
time the local health unit had been notified. On average there were 30
contacts per case, 11 (35%) of whom were too late for IG. As well, the lack
of ready access to adequate washing facilities within the community (e.g.
the lack of running water or flush toilets, shared hand towels, limited hot
water) meant that the recommended hygienic practices to prevent the spread
of disease were absent. As a long-standing tradition, community members
continued to meet regularly in large family gatherings following a church
service, or for social events for youth to share meals.
Under these circumstances, the outbreak team decided that a hepatitis A
vaccination program for the community was necessary to control the
outbreak. On 5 March, a joint request was made to the Ministry of Health
for a supply of vaccine to be administered by health-unit staff to all
community members between 2 and 45 years of age. The selection of this age
group for vaccine targeting was based on the age distribution of cases to
date. The lack of older cases supported historic reports from community
members of hepatitis A illness in the community more than 40 years ago.
After a review of the available information and noting that the closed
nature of the community made a vaccine campaign response feasible, the
Ministry agreed.
Over the course of the month, an estimated 69% (3,487/5,054) of the target
population received vaccine from 39 temporary, community-based clinics. No
new cases were identified for over 8 weeks following the vaccine campaign.
The outbreak was declared over.
In this particular outbreak, the actual number of new cases did not
escalate over time. This can be largely attributed to the use of IG among
contacts. During the month before the vaccine campaign, one new adult case
had been reported. Whether or not there would have been a resurgence of
cases without the use of vaccine is not known. The risk, however, of
transmission through children with subclinical illness still remained. The
vaccination campaign resulted in a 77% vaccine coverage for children 2 to
13 years of age, thereby greatly diminishing this risk.
CCDR Editorial Comment
This outbreak emphasizes the importance of prompt reporting, investigation,
and intervention in the control of hepatitis A infection. Cooperation
between involved health units in responding to this specific situation is
to be commended. The precise place of hepatitis A vaccine in outbreak
control is not well defined. Vaccine has been used in a number of outbreak
situations, including in Canada, with apparent advantage; however, it is
not clear, for example, when vaccination should be initiated, how to target
the delivery of vaccine, and what level of vaccination delivery is
beneficial. From the current report, it cannot be determined if vaccine
usage significantly contributed to extinguishing the outbreak.
