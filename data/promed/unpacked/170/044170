Medical Officials Fear Outbreak of Typhoid
------------------------------------------
NAZRAN, Russia (Reuters) - Medical officials said Wednesday they feared an
outbreak of typhoid among Chechen refugees in Ingushetia after a young girl
was diagnosed with the disease. A 13-year-old refugee from the Chechen
capital Grozny became ill last week in the Ingush town of Nazran where she
arrived with her mother and brother, doctors said.
Zarema Albogachieva, a senior Ingush medical official, told Reuters it was
the first case of the disease since 1982 in Ingushetia, the Russian region
bordering Chechnya.
Medical officials have sounded the alarm about a possible typhoid epidemic
in Chechnya itself due to a shortage of running water. They say there are
at least 20 confirmed cases so far and dozens more are hospitalized with
suspected typhoid.
Officials have called for the rebuilding of Grozny's water infrastructure
to prevent the spread of typhoid, a daunting task in a region devastated by
years of war and neglect and a severe shortage of funds. Mazhit Albakov, an
Ingush doctor, said authorities had started adding chlorine to water and
taking special measures to prevent the spread of typhoid.
Doctors said the constant flow of refugees in and out of Chechnya increased
the risk of contagion. They said the stricken girl may have contracted
typhoid from an aunt who recently visited the family from Chechnya.
