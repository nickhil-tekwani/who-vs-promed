[Equine infectious anemia (EIA) is a persistent viral infection of equids. The causative agent, EIA virus (EIAV), is a lentivirus in the family _Retroviridae_, subfamily _Orthoretrovirinae_.

EIAV is not considered a risk for human health.

For additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2014, Chapter 2.5.6 "Equine infectious anaemia" at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.05.06_EIA.pdf (adopted by the World Assembly of Delegates in May 2013).

The clinical signs of acute EIA are often nonspecific. In some cases in horses, the only sign is a fever, which is sometimes accompanied by transient inappetence. In mild cases, the fever can last less than 24 hours. More severely affected horses can become weak, depressed and inappetent, with additional signs that may include jaundice, tachypnea, tachycardia, ventral pitting edema, thrombocytopenia, petechiae on the mucus membranes, epistaxis or blood-stained feces. Anemia can occur, although it is more likely to be severe in chronically infected animals. Occasionally, horses become gravely ill and may die during the acute stage. After the initial bout, most horses become asymptomatic carriers; however, some animals develop recurring clinical signs that vary from mild illness and failure to thrive to fever, depression, petechial hemorrhages on the mucus membranes, weight loss, anemia and dependent edema. Inapparent infections may become symptomatic during concurrent illnesses, severe stress or hard work. Death is possible during these febrile episodes. Ophthalmic lesions, characterized by depigmentation with prominent choroidal vessels, have been reported in chronically infected horses.
