[Re: ProMED-mail Dioxin contamination - Germany, Netherlands: table
eggs, organic 20100511.1540]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Further to the questions asked about the levels of dioxin and PCB's in
table eggs, there is an official publication on this topic by the
German Bundesinstitut fuer Risikobewertung (BfR) [Federal Institute
for Risk Assessment] of 5 May 2010 when this issue became public,
available [in German] at
<http://www.bfr.bund.de/cm/208/bewertung_von_dioxingehalten_in_eiern_auf_grund_einer_warnung_im_eu_schnellwarnsystem.pdf>.

[The report includes] a table with official results from German and
Dutch laboratories. The highest level is 14.89 WHO-PCDD/F-PCB-TEQ pg/g
[fat] [WHO-polychlorinated
dibenzo-para-dioxins/dibenzofurans-polychlorinated biphenyls-toxic
equivalent]

In a Dutch Food Inspection press notice of today [12 May 2010] the
dioxin values are quoted as 2-4 times the legal limit.

[I appreciate Mr Michels sending the report. It appears that while
this situation became public on 5 May 2010, there is evidence that the
contaminated eggs were known as far back as 16 Mar 2010
<http://taz.de/1/zukunft/umwelt/artikel/1/kontrolleure-warnten-erst-spaet/>.

The ministry of agriculture of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in Germany
stated that tainted feed has been distributed to goat and pig farms as
well. So it is probable we have not heard the last of this situation.

While the levels quoted above are 2-4 times the legal limit, what is
the legal limit? - Mod.TG]
