The family and relatives of Birgitte Kallestad wanted to say goodbye to the young woman under sheltered and private frames.

At 1:00 p.m. today [Wed 15 May 2019], the 24-year-old was buried in the upbringing municipality of Fjell in Hordaland.

"Intangible to all of us, her goodness became her path. Nevertheless, according to Birgitte's heart, it is now possible to give a gift to the Animal Protection. It's a great way to honor her memory," priest Maria Tveiten said in the memorial in the Foldnes church.

On [Mon 6 May 2019], she died of rabies at Forde central hospital in Sogn og Fjordane, which was the bioengineer's own workplace.

It is the 1st time since 1812 that rabies -- also known as dog madness -- was registered on Norway's mainland.

The 24-year-old was infected by bites on her fingers from a dog puppy when she and friends were traveling in the Philippines in February this year [2019]. The death of the fun-loving, young woman has made a deep impression on all she knew.

Shortly after her death, the family sent out a statement through a spokesperson, Jens Eikas, a communicator, about what had happened. The death and the family's openness have focused on a risk factor in about 150 countries but have gone under the radar here at home.

"Our dear Birgitte loved animals. Our fear is that such fate may happen to others who have a warm heart like her. We want rabies vaccine to be included in the program for travellers to locations where the disease is present, and that people become more aware of the danger. If we manage to achieve this, the death of our sunbeam can save others. Warm greetings from the family."

The family's thoughts about the future have also made an impression in a country with many on the road.

Birgitte discovered a helpless puppy at the roadside when she and her friends were on a moped trip in the Philippines. Birgitte picked it up in a basket and took it to the house where they were staying.

There, the puppy got on, playing with everyone and nibbling the new playmates in the fingers, as puppies do. But Birgitte, with her daily ballast as a health worker, was not afraid that these little bites were not sterile, the family reported after her death.

She got sick long after she came home, and after several doctor visits one of the doctors suggested that she should be checked for rabies. The family boasts of the follow-up she received from the health service.

The Norwegian Institute of Public Health has not received reports [of illness] from the others on the trip to the Philippines or in the house where [the friends] played with the puppy in the garden.

Several people in Birgitte Kallestad's vicinity have been vaccinated against rabies in retrospect. The vaccination may have an effect on the virus.

Professor OLrjan Olsvik at the University of Tromso has informed the VG that the rabies [virus] in most cases lies in the body for up to a few months before [the infected person] becomes ill. But the infection can also lie in the body several years before it strikes.

Rabies is widespread especially in southeast Asia and Africa. Dogs are the source of human infection in far more than 90% of cases.

The family, who live in the municipality, wants to be spared from inquiries from the press. Eikas is appointed as the spokesperson of the family. The rabid-infected woman died on Monday [6 May 2019] night as a result of the very serious viral disease.

"She was also at an age where she has a large network [of friends], and with many close. The family is very affected by [her death]", says Eikas.

Crisis staff have therefore been established in the Sotra municipality, west of Bergen.

"All the relatives live here. We have established a crisis team when we know that some of the relatives want such a contact," confirms vice president Steinar Nesse.

The woman is from a village with few inhabitants, and the councilor believes that everyone here knows the person.

"It is a terrible matter, and it is the 1st time in 200 years that someone has died of rabies in Norway," says Nesse.

The woman lived in Forde and died at Forde central hospital with her closest family around her. Only on Tuesday [7 May 2019] was the municipality informed that the woman is from Fjell.

"It is very heavy and vulnerable for the family," says health manager Terje Handal in the municipality. He says that a crisis team was established before the municipality was contacted by Helse Forde.

- What does such a crisis team consist of?

"People in psychiatry, a municipal psychologist, a health nurse, and a doctor. All are needed, and those who are best qualified when it comes to crisis management," he says.

Fjell Mayor Marianne Sandahl Bjoroy tells VG that the crisis team has been in contact with the relatives. "This is very sad for the relatives, who are probably left with many unanswered questions," she says. "The municipality of Fjell will set up for them and give them the help they need as long as they want it."

Municipal consultant at Forde, Oystein Furnes, says that the municipality has not had treatment responsibility for the patient during the course of the disease, but that they had contact with her at the very beginning when she started to get symptoms. He does not want to comment on the symptoms in the case in question but says, on a general basis, that the disease often gives rise to diffuse symptoms at 1st, such as agitation, anxiety, and depression, before it gradually becomes more serious.

"The woman was admitted to Forde central hospital on Thursday [2 May 2019] but consulted a doctor several times before this, according to Furnes. She was admitted to the emergency room for 24 hours but was discharged again."

"What we can see here is that it has been quite natural that there has been contact with the primary health service. If one had suspected that it was a serious illness, one would, of course, admit her to the hospital, which she eventually became."

- Was there any other illness suspected before she was admitted?

"In all cases, different explanations of symptoms will be considered."

VG has asked whether the woman was vaccinated before or after the incident, but Helse Forde says they cannot answer this.

"We do not endorse any information about anything in the process," says Trine Hunskar Vingsnes, vice president, Helse Forde. "Between 25 and 30 employees at Forde central hospital are vaccinated against rabies. There are also a number of health workers in Forde municipality after contact with the infected woman."

- Do these get any kind of further follow-up?

"It doesn't seem to have been needed. We have had close contact with them, and they have open lines if they want to talk. We have received feedback that they feel well taken care of," says Furnes.

Norwegian tourist Birgitte Kallestad was such an animal lover, she didn't think twice about stopping for a stray puppy she spotted on the side of the road while on vacation with friends in the Philippines in February [2019].

Kallestad, 24, picked up the puppy and took it with her back to the resort where she was staying, washed it, and played with it, according to the BBC, never thinking she was in any danger. The puppy did bite her several times, news reports indicate, but she didn't think much about that either; after all, it was just a baby.

A health worker herself, she washed the cuts out and didn't seek further treatment, according to a family statement given to Norway's state-owned broadcaster NRK, USA Today reported.

When Kallestad returned home to Norway, she actually felt fine for a while. It wasn't until 28 Apr [2019] that she was 1st admitted to a hospital, her family said, but by then the illness was so far advanced that doctors had a hard time diagnosing it. When they did, it was too late. Kellestad died from rabies last Monday [6 May 2019].

A 24-year-old Norwegian woman died this week of rabies, after she was bitten by a puppy she rescued while on vacation in the Philippines, her family announced.

In February [2019], while on holiday with friends, Birgitte Kallestad found a "helpless" puppy on the side of the road during a scooter ride.

"Birgitte put the puppy in a basket and brought him home. She cleaned it and cared for it, and to her joy, it started healing. They played with the puppy in the garden" of the resort where they were staying, the family said in a statement published on Thursday [9 May 2019] evening. "After a while, the puppy started trying to bite them, like puppies do. It nipped their fingers when they were playing," the statement continued.

The young woman, a hospital employee, started feeling ill after her return to Norway and was put into intensive care at Forde hospital, where she worked and where she passed away on Monday [6 May 2019] evening.

According to the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, the last recorded case of rabies contracted by a human in mainland Norway dates back to 1815, and to 1826 for an animal.

According to the family no one in the group of friends had been vaccinated against rabies. "Our dear Birgitte loved animals. Our fear is that this will happen to others who have a warm heart like hers," her family said.

At least 59 000 people worldwide die each year worldwide from the animal-borne disease, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

More than 99% of victims are concentrated in Asia, Africa, and South America.

A Norwegian tourist has died after she was infected with rabies months ago from a stray puppy in the Philippines, Norwegian media reported. Birgitte Kallestad, 24, died earlier this week, her family said in a statement Thursday [9 May 2019], according to NRK, Norway's state-owned broadcaster.

Kallestad and her friends were in the Philippines in February [2019] and spotted the puppy on the side of the road, NRK reported. The woman grabbed the puppy and bathed it after bringing it back to where they were staying, but soon the small dog began nibbling on her and her friend's fingers, the family said, according to NRK. No one thought much of it, and Kallestad, a health worker, washed the small cuts out, NRK reported. But when the woman returned home to Norway, she fell ill.

According to Verdens Gang, a Norwegian tabloid, Kallestad went to doctors multiple times before her death, but none connected her symptoms to rabies. The tabloid reported that doctors said it was the 1st rabies-related death in the Scandinavian country in 200 years.

Rabies is a deadly, viral disease that infects the central nervous system. Post-exposure vaccines are used to prevent progression of the disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Symptoms -- such as fever, headache, and weakness or discomfort -- can appear similar to other diseases at 1st. Other more serious symptoms develop later, including insomnia, anxiety, confusion, slight or partial paralysis, excitation, hallucinations, agitation, hypersalivation (increase in saliva), difficulty swallowing, and hydrophobia (fear of water), the CDC says.

Rabies deaths are rare in the United States, though wild animals do still carry the virus. In the Philippines, there is a "high risk" of contracting rabies, the World Health Organization said in 2013.

"Our dear Birgitte loved animals," her family said, according to the BBC. "Our fear is that this will happen to others who have a warm heart like her."

[In ProMED-mail's initial posting on this tragic event (archive no. 20190509.6461913), we stated that the report lacked detail. The additional media reports presented above have added several significant pieces of information:
- the visited rabies-affected country was the Philippines;
- the victim started showing clinical signs at an unspecified time after returning to Norway, remaining undiagnosed. She was first admitted to a hospital on 28 Apr 2019, more than 2 months after her exposure to the rabid animal. The date and mode of diagnosis are not specified. She died there on 6 May 2019;
- some (or all?) of her travelmates, who may have been exposed to the rabid animal, have undergone (or are undergoing) post-exposure treatment (PET) in Norway;
- potentially exposed personnel in the hospital have undergone PET; and
- last, but certainly not least, the rabid animal in the Philippines was a collected, unwell puppy dog.

The latter piece of information deserves special attention. Stray puppies are notorious rabies vectors, in particular exposing children who are often involved in such situations, while exercising close contact with the to-become pets. The clinical signs of rabies in puppies may often be non-typical if not misleading, and -- in particular if the animals retain residual maternal immunity -- show minimal abnormalities while being infective. Every veterinary clinician in rabies-stricken regions is expected to know this, in many cases from their own experience. Also, residents of countries where rabies is prevalent, and visitors to these countries, should know that a "friendly" wild animal (e.g., foxes), which come close in a seemingly fearless way to humans, may be just rabid. Vets and public health professionals are supposed to educate the public. This information should be delivered to all: both visitors to rabies-affected countries as well as local residents.

Members of the public should refrain from collecting strange, stray puppies or offspring of other, non-domestic canids (e.g., foxes, jackals, etc.). Such activities should remain exclusively in the hand of the authorities or qualified/certified agencies.

It remains to be known if all co-travelers of the late Birgitte have been traced back and undergone PET. The incubation period for rabies is typically 1-3 months but may vary from less than a week to more than 2 years. Due to the potentially long incubation period for rabies, there is no time limit for giving PET, and all potential exposures should be risk-assessed. This and much more useful updated information on PET is available in the recently (April 2019) published "Guidelines on managing rabies post-exposure" (Public Health England, April 2019, 40 pages) at https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/800017/PHE_guidelines_on_rabies_post-exposure_treatment.pdf. - Mod.AS
