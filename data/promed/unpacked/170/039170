On Thu 3 Nov 2005, 4 cases of IgM-positive hepatitis A virus (HAV)
infections were notified to the Department of Epidemiology at Statens
Serum Institut in Denmark. All 4 patients fell ill between 12 and 20
Oct 2005. The patients, 3 women and one man, were part of a group of
29 Danish tourists who travelled to Turkey on an individually
arranged group holiday at a resort near Antalya, between 17 and 24
Sep 2005. The group travelled together on a direct flight from Copenhagen.
The Danish authorities immediately posted an alert on the European
Early Warning and Response System, because the investigation revealed
that German and Russian speaking guests also stayed at the resort
during the same period. In addition, the Europe office of the World
Health Organization was informed, which then contacted the Turkish
authorities. It seems that there were no other Danish tourists at the
resort during that week of 17 to 24 Sep 2005.
Investigation
-------------
A retrospective cohort study was carried out to identify potential
risk factors. A case was defined as a member of the Danish group who
visited the resort in Turkey, and who fell ill with an IgM-positive
hepatitis A infection in October 2005. Based on information gathered
during a telephone interview with one case, a standard questionnaire
was designed to collect information on clinical symptoms and exposure
factors (food and drink consumption, use of recreational facilities
and, previous HAV vaccination, and recommendation to receive
hepatitis A vaccination before travelling). Questionnaires were sent
out to all 29 tourists (26 by email, 3 by post) on 7 Nov 2005.
Results
-------
25 of 29 questionnaires were returned. No additional cases were
identified; only the 4 cases already known to have met the case
definition. 3 of these 4 patients needed in-patient hospital treatment.
The group consisted of 17 females and 12 males. The median age was 52
years (range 1 to 68). None of the group members had previously had a
hepatitis A infection. 9 people, none of whom were patients, reported
that they had received at least one vaccination against hepatitis A.
Some of these vaccinations had been given more than 10 years ago. All
cohort members who reported previous vaccination were excluded from
the analysis. 22 tourists reported that hepatitis A vaccination had
not been recommended to them before travel.
Only a few food items had been consumed outside the resort, and after
analysis, eating outside the resort was shown not to be a significant
risk factor for infection. The 2 risk factors significantly
associated with illness were: ice cream served from open containers
and dried fruit (Table). The patient sample sent for genotyping was
found to be genotype 1B. To our knowledge, no environmental
investigation has been conducted at the resort, but information from
the questionnaire indicated that ice cream was served at the resort's
buffet in large plastic containers, and guests at the resort were
invited to serve themselves with ice cream using a communal spoon
that was placed in an adjacent container of water.
Table. Selected exposure factors
--------------------------------
(Abbreviated; see original text for details and statistical analysis)
Food / Exposed Attack rate (percent) / Unexposed Attack rate
(percent) / Relative risk
Ice cream / 67 / nil / Infinite
Dried fruit / 75 / 8 / 9
Nuts and unpackaged snacks / 60 / 9 / 6
Cocktails / 50 / nil / Infinite
Discussion
----------
Our results suggest that ice cream served in open containers and
dried fruit were the potential vehicles of transmission of hepatitis
A in this outbreak, but interpretation of the results is limited by
the small number of cases. The dates of onset of illness point toward
a common source (that may be ongoing) but not to person-to-person
transmission. The genotype 1B found in one sample is not a common
type in Denmark, and is predominantly seen in cases imported from
outside Europe.
In Denmark, it is recommended that tourists travelling to Turkey be
vaccinated against hepatitis A before travelling. This outbreak
demonstrates the importance of this recommendation. We encourage
other countries to remain vigilant for cases in tourists returning
from Turkey and suggest an environmental investigation by Turkish
authorities, as the source of the outbreak may be continuing to cause
illness. At present there is no formal feedback from the Turkish
authorities and, to our knowledge, no additional cases have been detected.

[A previous report of hepatitis A virus infection in Denmark
indicated that infection was predominantly among men having sex with
men. Lack of awareness of the risk for travellers may explain the
poor uptake of hepatitis A vaccine. The data, although limited,
illustrate the high level of protection conferred by vaccination. - Mod.CP]
