More infections of hand-foot-mouth disease [HFMD] in Viet Nam have been caused by EV71 [human enterovirus 71], the most common and dangerous strain of enterovirus, which [causes] the disease, a health official said. Doctor Nguyen Tran Hien, head of Viet Nam National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, said the increasing influence of the strain "is the most worrying factor about HFMD infections in Viet Nam at the present," according to a report Friday [1 Jul 2012] by news website Dan Tri.

Viet Nam has reported 27 HFMD deaths out of around 50 000 infections so far this year [2012], and all the fatalities were caused by the EV71, according to latest statistics from the Health Ministry. The statistics also showed EV71 has caused around 80 percent of the infections this year.

Last year [2011], many but not all of 169 deaths were caused by the virus strain and only 20 percent of the 110 000 infections [were caused] by it. Most of the cases were instead caused by [a coxsackievirus] strain, Hai told the media on the sidelines of a Nha Trang conference. He said EV71 is the most toxic among intestinal viruses, "capable of causing brain, neurological, and respiration complications that lead to death."

Hai said health agencies are working to find answers for the remarkable changes in the disease, which [usually] begins with mouth sores and blisters on hands and feet. They will also try to explain the sudden increase of infections in the north, which last year [2011] reported fewer cases than the south, but at present is accounting for half of the infections nationwide with around 22 000 patients.

Hai said there's a theory that the molecular structure [genotype] of EV71 in the north is different of that in the south of Viet Nam. He said studies by the institute found the genetic structure of the virus strain has changed since 2008.

There's no vaccine or specific medication for the disease and doctors say that the best defense against it is good hygiene.

[ProMED-mail and Mod.CP thank Ronan Kelly for drawing attention to this earlier report which indicates that the HFMD situation in Viet Nam is similar to that affecting neighbouring Cambodia and which was reported there initially as an undiagnosed fatal illness of children.

This report from Viet Nam adds the information that the greater severity of some cases of the disease in the north of Viet Nam may be a consequence of the appearance of novel genotype of enterovirus 71.
