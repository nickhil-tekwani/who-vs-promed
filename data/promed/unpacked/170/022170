This year's [2017] mumps outbreak is the highest number of reported cases Florida has experienced in the last 5 years combined.

At least 56 cases of mumps have been reported in the Sunshine State in 2017 across all ages.

Half of those cases are in patients who have received the MMR vaccination which is meant to prevent measles, mumps and rubella.

Though Florida is experiencing a significant rise in infections, it is well below outbreaks in other states that have seen hundreds of cases of mumps this year [2017]. Health officials estimate that there are about 5000 cases of reported mumps across the US this year.

The majority of those outbreaks are in Arkansas, Missouri, New York, Washington, and Texas.

In Florida, most infections were reported in Broward, Collier, Duval, Hillsborough, and Palm Beach counties, according to a Florida Department of Health.

The 2017 count includes confirmed and probable cases, according to Brad Dalton, a health department spokesman, the Miami Herald reports.

This is the largest mumps outbreak in Florida in the past decade, though infection rates have been steadily increasing the past couple of years.

In 2016 there were 16 cases and 2015 there were 10 reported cases, meaning 2017 showed a significant increase.

Health officials suspect that there are more cases that have gone unreported due to patients experiencing minor to no symptoms. Symptoms typically include swollen glands, puffy cheeks, headaches, fever, chills and fatigue and usually appear about two weeks after being infected.

Mumps spreads through contact with infected saliva or mucus, commonly from sharing drinks or eating from the same cutlery.

Outbreaks in Florida have been reported among those in close settings such as roommates or sports teammates.

Treatment for mumps focuses on relieving symptoms until the body's immune system fights off the infection.

There are currently no medications to treat the mumps virus and it typically takes two weeks to fully recover.

According to the CDC, the best way to prevent contracting the infection is to receive the MMR vaccination which is effective 88 percent of the time.

[From 1 Jan-2 Dec 2017, 48 states and the District of Columbia in the US reported mumps infections in 4980 people to CDC. Before the US mumps vaccination program started in 1967, about 186 000 cases were reported each year, but the actual number of cases was likely much higher due to under-reporting. Since the pre-vaccine era, there has been a more than 99 percent decrease in mumps cases in the United States. Since the 2-dose vaccination program was introduced in 1989, mumps cases have ranged year to year from a couple of hundred to several thousand. However, in recent years, there has been an increase in the number of reported cases, from 229 cases in 2012 to 5833 cases in 2016. The recent increase has been mainly due to multiple mumps outbreaks reported across the country in settings where people often have close contact with one another, like college campuses (from https://www.cdc.gov/mumps/outbreaks.html, includes a map showing case numbers by state and figure showing cases over time, from 2000-2017, as of 2 Dec 2017).

[2] Alaska (Anchorage)

The [Alaska] state health department says a mumps outbreak in Anchorage has surpassed 100 confirmed cases, and the department is updating its vaccination recommendations.

The state has confirmed 119 cases of the disease, with another 19 classified as "probable." The state says a booster dose of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is the best way to protect yourself, if you haven't received 2 doses of the vaccine already.

The state now recommends a 2nd dose of the vaccine for school-age children who have only received one dose, and for adults who are at high risk of mumps exposure, like healthcare workers, international travelers, and post-secondary students.

For people in group settings where mumps is currently circulating, or for Anchorage residents who are Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islanders, the state is recommending a 2nd dose of the vaccine for anyone whose 1st dose was at least 4 weeks ago, and a 3rd dose for anyone whose last round of the vaccine was more than 5 years ago.

The state says anyone with mumps should self-isolate by staying home and away from public spaces like school and work for 5 days after the onset of swollen glands.

The symptoms are tender, self-limited swelling of the parotid or other salivary glands lasting more than 2 days without another apparent cause. Headaches and muscle aches are also a sign.

It's spread by direct contact with respiratory droplets like coughing and sneezing and incubation is between 12 and 25 days. The disease is most contagious between 2 days before swelling, and 5 days afterward.

[3] North Island (Auckland)

The mumps outbreak is an epidemic, say Auckland health leaders, who have asked the Ministry of Health to launch a nationwide vaccination campaign.

The public health officials say the low immunisation rates are also leaving the city vulnerable to a potentially deadly, large scale measles outbreak.

They said they were now dealing with an epidemic because the disease can't be contained.

More than 1000 people have contracted mumps in Auckland this year [2017], most of them from the so called "lost generation" of 11-29 year olds with low rates of measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccination.

The chief executives of Auckland, Counties Manukau and Waitemata district health boards [DHBs], and 2 senior Auckland Regional Public Health service officials, wrote to the ministry saying a national response was needed to help slow the disease.

Current measures were having little impact, their letter said. It asked for a "catch-up" campaign for all those who haven't been vaccinated -- most of them adolescents and adults. That was crucial to bringing the outbreak under control and prevent it taking hold nationally, the letter said.

Mumps cases have already been reported in Dunedin, Whanganui, Northland, and Hamilton.

In a statement to RNZ [Radio NZ], Auckland Regional Public Health Service director Julia Peters said the outbreak could now be described as an epidemic because it was widespread and it was not possible to stop its transmission.

The outbreak was likely to continue for 2 years but with a nationwide vaccination programme the number of cases could be cut by 1/3, she said.

About 1.3 million New Zealanders are aged 10-29 and if the estimate that 40 percent are not fully vaccinated is correct, that would mean 570 000 are susceptible to mumps.

The Ministry of Health said in a statement it would give a response to the DHBs shortly.

A suspected case of mumps has health officials warning that the recent outbreak may have spread to the top of the South Island.

People who stayed at the Inlet Backpackers in Collingwood on 27 Dec 2017 or Blue Moon Lodge in Havelock on 25 or 26 Dec 2017 may have been exposed to mumps.

The person with mumps has now been isolated, and people do not need to cancel bookings or alter their holiday plans, but remain alert to the symptoms.

Nelson Marlborough Public Health Service locum medical officer of health Dr Simon Baker said early symptoms of mumps included fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, and loss of appetite. Later, the salivary glands on one or both sides of the face, cheeks, or jaw may become swollen and sore.

"Should you develop any of these symptoms in the next 2-4 weeks please isolate yourself, and contact a doctor, who will probably call you in to have a swab taken, and give you further advice," Baker said.

"Immunisation is the best way to protect yourself from mumps, and we recommend you check your child health book or contact your doctor to make sure you have received 2 doses of the MMR vaccine, and are therefore fully immunised."
