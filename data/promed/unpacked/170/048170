100 confirmed typhoid cases
----------------------------
100 cases of typhoid have been confirmed so far in 2005, the Ministry of
Health says. Director of Public Health Doctor Timaima Tuiketei said the
ministry had identified many other suspected cases and carriers who were
being treated and followed up on.
Of the 100 confirmed cases so far, 38 were reported in the Central
Division, one from the West and the largest number, 61, from the North. 2
people have died since the infection broke out.
Dr Tuiketei said health workers in the North were on alert after a fresh
outbreak was suspected in Wainunu, Bua.
"We cannot confirm if the cases are typhoid. It could be other forms of
diarrhea with similar symptoms," she said. Dr Tuiketei said the ministry
had received reports of 12 people having symptoms similar to typhoid in
Wainunu.
Earlier reports said 5 students were suspected of having typhoid, taking
the total number of student cases in Bua to 45.
Only 2 of the 13 students from Ratu Luke Memorial School have been kept at
Nabouwalu Hospital for observation, with the rest sent home, said Nabouwalu
Hospital medical officer Doctor Marvin Ketenalagi.
Northern Division health services director Doctor Ami Chandra said they
were still waiting for results of laboratory tests to confirm the cause of
the outbreak among the 13 school children.
He said field investigations had yet to be completed, but the school was
allowed to operate normally. "Right now we're 90 percent sure it's not
typhoid but we are still awaiting lab results," Dr Chandra said.
He said cases observed at the Nabouwalu Hospital had symptoms ranging from
bloody stools and acute diarrhea, which could be attributed to shigella
bacterial infection.

Students hospitalized for typhoid
-----------------------------------
11 students from Ratu Luke Primary and Ratu Luke Secondary School are still
admitted at the Nabouwalu hospital with suspected typhoid. Despite hospital
authorities in Nabouwalu refusing to divulge any information on the
progress of the students, school manager Eroni Tabakece said they are still
admitted at the hospital.
Blood samples and water samples were also taken from the school but results
of the tests are still pending. The students' stools were taken to Labasa
hospital for tests. Last week, the school was forced to close after 11
students were admitted at the Nabouwalu hospital suffering from suspected
typhoid.

[It seems that not all of the student cases are likely to be typhoid
infection. Indeed, even without bloody diarrhea -- which is much more
suggestive of shigellosis or amoebiasis -- constipation is often more
prominent than diarrhea in typhoid fever. - Mod.LL]
