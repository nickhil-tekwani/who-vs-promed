We would like to inform you that the diagnostic laboratory at the Animal Health Trust (AHT) in Newmarket, UK has recently confirmed 2 positive cases of equine influenza in the UK.

The 1st case was in North Yorkshire affecting an unvaccinated 4-year-old Connemara that presented with clinical signs of pyrexia, inappetance, mild dry cough and mucopurulent nasal discharge for the preceding 6 days. Positive diagnosis was made by qPCR on a nasopharyngeal swab performed at the AHT. Three other horses were affected out of 10 at the premises.

The 2nd case was in the Scottish Borders affecting a 6-year-old unvaccinated Irish sporthorse mare that presented with mucopurulent nasal discharge and cough for the preceding 4 days. Positive diagnosis was confirmed by qPCR on a nasopharyngeal swab performed at the AHT. There were 20 in contact horses at the premises.
