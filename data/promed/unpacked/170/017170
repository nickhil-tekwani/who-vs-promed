[The previous, initial report on the occurrence of FMDV type SAT2 in Libya
mentioned 5 cases in bovines, which were not destroyed nor slaughtered. The
current report says that all 50 susceptible exposed bovines, of which 10
were reportedly infected, have been destroyed. This step seems necessary in
light of the seriousness of the threat.
According to FAO statistics, the animal population of Libya includes 152
000 bovines, 6.4 million ovines and 2.2 million caprines. Preventing the
introduction of the SAT 2 virus into small ruminants, which may become
subsequently virus carriers for an unpredictable period (theoretically, up
to several months), will need significant efforts. -Mod. AS].
