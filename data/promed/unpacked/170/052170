First Equine Case of West Nile Virus Infection in Washington State
-------------------------------------------------
The Washington State Department of Agriculture announced today that West
Nile virus has been confirmed in a 14-year-old horse in Island County. The
horse, which became ill early in October 2002, is recovering. It is the
first horse known to have become infected with West Nile virus in
Washington. "This is a reminder for horse owners to consider vaccinating
their horses," said Dr. Robert Mead, state veterinarian. "Now may be a good
time to act, because the vaccine requires 2 doses 3 to 6 weeks apart, and
immunity will not be achieved until 5 weeks after the second vaccine. An
annual booster should be given just prior to the start of the mosquito
season in your area."
The Island County horse had received the 2-shot vaccine on 4 Sep and 2 Oct
2002. The animal became ill 10 days later, indicating that a mosquito bit
it before immunity was established. The test results were reported by the
Washington Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory in Pullman and confirmed
yesterday by the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa.
West Nile virus affects horses, mules, donkeys, and other equines much more
often than other domestic animals. Most horses do not become ill and show
no symptoms at all. Those that do become ill show signs such as loss of
appetite, loss of coordination, confusion, head pressing, fever, stiffness,
and muscle weakness. About one-third of horses that become ill die.
The best way to minimize the threat of West Nile virus is to control
mosquito populations and prevent horses from being exposed to adult
mosquitoes. Some protective measures include changing the water in
livestock troughs, fountains, birdbaths and wading pools weekly during
mosquito season. Owners may also consider draining or treating stagnant
water, mowing grass and weeds, applying repellents, putting up screens to
protect homes and stables from mosquitoes, and putting horses in stables at
night.
Repellents and insecticides should be used only according to directions. To
report a potential case of West Nile virus in horses, call the State
Veterinarian's Office at 360/902-1878, or the U.S. Department of
Agriculture in Olympia at 360/753-9430.

West Nile Virus Activity; Missouri - Jan 1 to 9 Nov 2002
--------------------------------------------------------
During the period 1 Jan to 9 Nov 2002, the Missouri Department of Health
and Senior Services (MDHSS) identified 168 persons with laboratory evidence
of West Nile virus (WNV) infection; 34 cases were confirmed by CDC on the
basis of the plaque-reduction neutralization test, and 134 cases were
classified as probable pending CDC confirmation. Of the 5 cases that were
fatal, all had encephalitis.
The 168 patients had a median age of 53.2 years (range: 4 to 92 years); 91
patients (53 percent) were male. Median age of decedents was 75.6 years
(range: 61 to 88 years). Dates of illness onset ranged from 11 Jul to 12
Oct 2002.
Of Missouri's 114 reporting local public health agencies (LPHAs), 109 (96
percent) have reported WNV-positive animal tests, representing nearly all
geographic regions and human population centers in Missouri. Human WNV
cases have occurred among persons from 32 (28 percent) of LPHA districts;
126 (75 percent) patients resided in metropolitan St. Louis districts. The
metropolitan Kansas City area has recorded 8 cases; no human WNV cases have
been reported from the Springfield area (Greene County). The elevated WNV
incidence rate in the metropolitan St. Louis area, especially within St.
Louis city limits (16.1 cases per 100 000 population), is under investigation.
Of 134 Missouri WNV cases for which case investigations are completed, 86
(64 percent) patients recalled being bitten by a mosquito 3 weeks before
onset of illness. In addition, 86 (64 percent) patients reported not using
repellent during that time. Patients spent an average of 4.4 hours outdoors
per day for leisure and work. Morning (47 percent) was the time that
patients most frequently reported being active outdoors for leisure and
work. A total of 58 (43 percent) patients reported having standing water
around their home during the 3 weeks preceding onset of illness. The top 4
reported sources of standing water were birdbaths, flowerpots, pet watering
containers, and tires.
MDHSS provides frequent updates on human cases of WNV and activity by
county for dead birds and infected horses on its
website: <http://www.dhss.state.mo.us/WestNileVirus/positives.pdf>
Results on specimens submitted for laboratory testing are provided to
patient providers, submitting laboratories, and local health departments.
MDHSS issues press releases updating case numbers, reminding the public of
personal protection measures, and advising elimination of sources of
standing water around residences. MDHSS produced a statewide prevention
campaign based on the slogan "Don't Let It Bug You," which included posters
and brochures distributed to all 114 LPHAs, direct-mail appeals to St.
Louis area clergy for increased community awareness of mosquito habitats,
television and radio public service announcements, and a toll-free hotline
for citizens' questions.
Mosquito-control program recommendations, developed by MDHSS are available
at <http://www.dhss.state.mo.us>.
The decision to initiate a control program has been left to local
municipalities.
