WellPet has initiated a voluntary recall of a limited amount of one canned topper product due to potential elevated levels of naturally occurring beef thyroid hormone.

Recalled Product Details:
- Wellness 95 percent Beef Topper for Dogs - 13.2 oz
- Best-By Dates of 02 FEB 19, 29 AUG 19 and 30 AUG 19, located on the bottom of the can.

Three best-by date codes of one recipe have the potential to contain elevated levels of naturally occurring beef thyroid hormone. Elevated levels may affect a dog's metabolism and can be associated with anxiousness, increased thirst, increased urinary output and weight loss. However, with prolonged consumption, these signs may increase in severity and may include vomiting, diarrhea, and rapid or difficulty breathing.

Although multiple studies indicate that for the vast majority of pets, signs are reversible once the pet stops eating product with elevated thyroid hormone, if your pet has consumed this product and has exhibited any of these signs, please contact your veterinarian.

The recipe is a mixer or topper and is intended for intermittent or supplemental feeding only; the likelihood of a dog being affected is remote. Even though the chance of a dog being affected is unlikely, WellPet is voluntarily recalling this recipe with these 3 best-by dates. No other Wellness products are affected. Affected products were distributed at pet specialty retailers throughout North America and online.

Although the WellPet Consumer Affairs team has received no reports of any health problems to date as a result of feeding this recipe, the FDA advised WellPet of 3 dogs that were affected. WellPet immediately initiated an investigation, and based on follow-up research, decided to recall the lots in question. The dogs are now fully recovered and doing well.

"Please know that safeguarding the health and wellbeing of pets is of the utmost importance to us," said Camelle Kent, chief executive officer of WellPet, the maker of Wellness products. "We fully intend on maintaining the trust you have placed in us to keep your pets healthy and happy and are removing this product as part of our ongoing commitment to quality and food safety."

If you have any of the 13.2 oz recipe with these 3 best-by dates, please email WellPet at <wecare@wellpet.com> or call 1-877-227-9587. For more information, please visit WellPet's website for a letter from the CEO.

[While the product is intended as a topper to other regular food, it may not always be used in that fashion. Some individual animals may receive more than just a tasty topping of this particular food.

A small amount of this food may have no affect, but an animal on treatment for a thyroid condition may perhaps be more affected than a normal animal.

Be safe, and return the pet food, and have your pet tested for any thyroid issues, generally a blood test at the veterinary office. - Mod.TG]
