Syphilis, which had been so rare that health officials believed it
would be eliminated by 2005, is becoming more common in New York City
and throughout the country, the New York Times reports
(<http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/12/nyregion/12syphilis.html?_r=1&ref=health&oref=slogin>).
Some 260 cases were diagnosed in the city during the 1st quarter of
this year [2007] -- more than twice the number diagnosed during the
1st quarter of 2006. The condition, which had been largely limited to
men who have sex with men, is becoming more common in women (10 cases
occurred in women, after 10 years of nearly no female cases). Health
officials say an increase in bisexual behavior among homosexual men
may have spurred the increase in female cases.
"Risky behaviors and unsafe sex appear to be on the rise," the
article notes. "And many health experts warned that a spike in HIV
cases could come on the heels of the syphilis outbreak."

[The total number of cases of syphilis (primary, secondary, and
tertiary) reported annually in the United States declined
dramatically in the 1940's to a low in 2000. As the rate of primary
and secondary (infectious) syphilis (a better indicator of disease
activity) decreased among homosexual and bisexual males, largely
because of changes in sexual behavior due to AIDS, a spike occurred
in the late 1980s among heterosexual men, women, and neonates
(congenital syphilis) that was attributed to epidemic of crack
cocaine use and exchange of sex for drugs. Cases of syphilis again
dropped from 1990 to 2000. In 2000, the rate of primary and secondary
syphilis in the United States was 2.1 cases per 100 000 population,
the lowest since reporting began in 1941. From 2001 to 2004, the
primary and secondary syphilis rate increased nationally to 2.7,
primarily as a result of increases in cases among men who have sex
with men (<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5510a1.htm>).
The recent upsurge in syphilis cases in Manhattan has also been
centered among gay men, and there has been an increase in cases among
women, who may be having sex with bisexual men. Infectious syphilis
can increase the chance of HIV transmission 3 to 5 fold and
infectious syphilis in women can be followed by an increase in
neonatal syphilis.
Multiple factors likely account for the recent resurgence in
syphilis, including "HIV prevention fatigue", which appears to limit
effective condom use, and use of "club" drugs, such as
methamphetamine, gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB), Ecstasy, and ketamine,
that can also lead to unsafe sex with multiple partners
(<http://www.nida.nih.gov/infofacts/Clubdrugs.html>.)
Use of the Internet for sexual partnering may also be a contributing
factor. The problem is not isolated to the US; in Canada, syphilis is
now reported to be 9 times the rate it was in 1997
(<http://www.thestar.com/article/245612>). - Mod.ML]
