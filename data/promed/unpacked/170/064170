SYPHILIS
========

We are experiencing an unusual outbreak of syphilis in a relatively affluent
population. Despite the presence of chancres and obvious clinical signs of
syphilis, we have gotten several false negative tests which we have been told
is due to the presence of cocaine in the blood.
Any further information on the affect of illicit drugs on syphilis testing
would be appreciated.
