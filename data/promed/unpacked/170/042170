FDA recalls popular heartworm drug for dogs
Medicine linked to thousands of injuries, deaths
------------------------------------------------
ProHeart 6, a twice-a-year time-released heartworm medication used to
treat millions of dogs, was recalled Friday at the request of the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) after thousands of animals suffered
adverse reactions.
ProHeart 6 was the 1st, and only, product approved by the FDA to be
administered once every 6 months to treat heartworm disease [caused by
_Dirofilaria immitis_] in dogs. Its active ingredient, moxidectin, has been
administered without problem to horses and cattle.
The time-released version caused few problems when given to dogs at
higher doses in clinical trials. Health and safety problems quickly
cropped up, however, when ProHeart 6 was used to treat dogs after
receiving FDA approval.
Reports of injuries, deaths
---------------------------
As of 4 Aug 2004, the drug agency received 5552 reports of adverse
reactions after dogs received heartworm shots. About 500 dogs died,
though the agency said many deaths were not directly attributable to
the product, manufactured by Fort Dodge Animal Health, based in
Overland Park, Kansas, a subsidiary of the pharmaceutical company Wyeth.
Some dog deaths were linked convincingly to the heartworm medication,
which prompted the recall, said Dr. Stephen F. Sundlof, director of
the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine.
Dog owners were urged to consult veterinarians about other
medications to prevent heartworm.
The agency had already asked Fort Dodge to revise the drug's label
and to issue notices to veterinarians and dog owners pointing out
safety questions associated with the product.
"Despite all of the things that have been done, we continue to see
these adverse events at approximately the same rate," Sundlof told
reporters late Friday.
The problems suffered by dogs include sudden lethargy, uncontrolled
bleeding, vomiting, diarrhea, heart and liver problems and such
nervous system abnormalities as seizures.
"We don't really understand why this product is causing these
problems," Sundlof said. "It affects dogs of all sizes and,
apparently, dogs of all ages."
Fort Dodge Animal Health is cooperating with FDA's request for a
recall but has "concerns about how the agency interpreted these
complex data," the animal health product manufacturer said in a
prepared statement.
"Based on a thorough evaluation of FDA's data and consultation with
independent experts in veterinary medicine and epidemiology, Fort
Dodge Animal Health stands behind ProHeart 6."
The FDA will convene an independent scientific advisory committee to
review the matter.
Heartworm disease is caused by a parasite transmitted to dogs via
mosquito bite. Roughly 250 000 dogs develop the potentially fatal
ailment each year. Fort Dodge Animal Health said it has sold 18
million doses of ProHeart 6 to veterinarians since FDA approval in
June 2001.

[Sponsors (companies) that develop drugs and secure their approval for
marketing through FDA are required to report adverse events. There are forms
that must be submitted to the FDA. When the adverse events cause deaths in
substantial numbers, then the FDA usually takes action.
The FDA can cause the sponser to amend the label, which Fort Dodge has done.
However, the problems have continued at a level that the FDA believes
warrants stronger action. Currently that is to recall the product.
It may be re-formulated, and marketed later, or more investigations as to the
animal deaths may determine that these were not directly related to the
product. - Mod.TG]
