Fatal Case of Measles Without Rash Found in Young Woman
--------------------------------------------------
A fatality from measles with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but without rash, has been reported, according to a study published online on 11 Jan 2012 in the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Emerging Infectious Diseases journal.

Julien Lupo, from the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Grenoble in France, and colleagues describe a fatal case of measles, with intractable ARDS [Acute Resporatory Distress syndrome], without rash, in a 29-year-old woman in France. The authors report that five days after receiving outpatient care with initiation of an anti-infective agent and oral prednisone for fever, cough, coryza, diarrhea, and weight loss, the patient was admitted to the hospital with persistent illness. Lab tests showed non-regenerative anemia and leukopenia with profound lymphopenia, and a chest radiograph revealed bilateral diffuse interstitial infiltrates; further antimicrobial therapy was started. Extensive testing did not find evidence of an underlying immunosuppressive disease; test results indicated an acute viral infection. On day three, severe respiratory failure occurred and the patient was transferred to an intensive care unit. On day six, a broad serological investigation identified isolated immunoglobulin M against measles virus. The patient was treated with ribavirin, corticosteroids, and intravenous immunoglobulin. Although the lymphocyte level returned to the reference range, the respiratory condition did not improve, and the patient died. The measles strain was genotyped as D4, an epidemic strain circulating in France and other parts of Europe. The patient had no history or presentation of enanthem or morbilliform rash, and no documented history of measles vaccination.

"This unusual case underscores the need for physicians to consider a diagnosis of measles, even in the absence of classical clinical features, during measles outbreaks. It also reemphasizes the insufficient vaccination coverage against measles in France," the authors write.

Measles outbreak in Chechnya
-------------------------
On the Republic of Chechya the health care authorities are currently treating 25 children who have contracted measles. The actual number of of children with measles is probably much higher, and the situation is quite serious. An an employee of the Ministry of Health of Chechnya told a representative of "The Caucasian Knot" that parents should continuously monitor their children's health, take appropriate preventative measures, and ensure that their children have been vaccinated.

Children of early school age are at greatest risk of contracting measles virus infection. The disease is transmitted by droplet infection and is highly contagious. In children complications may lead to the development of bronchitis and pneumonia. In more severe cases, the disease can cause central nervous system damage.

Measles outbreak in Lviv Oblast attributed to migrants from Italy
------------------------------------------------------
The Department of Health of the Lviv Oblast Administration has associated the outbreak of measles in the region with increased migration of people from Italy to Ukraine at the end of2011.

An increase in the incidence of measles in the Lviv Oblast occurred in the second half of 2011, coincident with an increase of measles virus infection in Italy. During the same period there was an enhanced displacement of of communities into Ukraine from other European countries notably from Italy

Surveillance by the Lviv Oblast Sanitary and Epidemiological authority established that measles of D4 genotype was the most frequently observed genotype. Genotype D4 measles virus has been prevalent throughout Europe, and in Italy in particular during the first half of 2011. Reduced levels of vaccination have been one of the reasons for the increase in incidence of measles throughout Europe.

In the Lviv Oblast during the period from1 Jan 2012 to 11 Jan 2012 303 cases of measles, including 131 cases in children, have been diagnosed. In total during the period 1 Dec 2010 to 11 Jan 2012 there have been 1118 cases of measles, 579 of whom were children , in the Lviv Oblast.

Besices the Lviv Oblast, measles outbreaks have been recorded in the Ivano-Frankivsk, Volyn, Rivne, Transcarpathia Oblasts, as well as in the city of Kiev.

Glasgow schoolchildren offered MMR vaccine as measles cases rise across Europe
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The NHS [National Health Service] is to write to all secondary schoolchildren whose immunisation records are incomplete. Secondary schoolchildren in Glasgow are being offered the MMR vaccine amid fears that measles outbreaks across Europe could spread to Scotland.

NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde is sending out letters to schoolchildren across the city whose vaccine records are incomplete. Uptake of the triple measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine dropped after a paper in The Lancet in 1998 suggested a possible link with autism. The claim has since been discredited by further medical research and the author of the report, Andrew Wakefield, was struck off the medical register after the General Medical Council found him guilty of serious professional misconduct. Cases of measles have been rising in several western European countries in recent years, causing concern that the disease may spread further. In the Republic of Ireland measles cases increased by 60 per cent in 2010.

Dr Syed Ahmed, consultant in public health medicine with NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, said many parents may not have got round to immunising their children after the MMR controversy. He told STV News: "I suspect it's something to do with the vaccine scare we had during 1995-96, the link with autism. I think what might have happened is parents probably thought they would revisit it some time later and they've forgotten about it. "So that's why we're sending out this letter to all parents whose children haven't got the full record saying here is another chance."

Ubundu: children dying every day from measles since October
----------------------------------------------------
Since October [2011], children are dying every day from measles in the vicinity of Ubundu [Orientale province] of the Democratic Repubic of Congo [Congo DR] which is located 125 km from Kisangani. This information was communicated to Radio Okapi on Tue 3 Jan 2012, by the staff of the local NGO [non-governmental organisation] Good Shepherd. The Chief Medical Officer of Health confirmed the extent of the outbreak but disputed the number of fatalities.

The head of the Good Shepherd organisation, Anthony Musemena, claims he had attended the funeral of three children, aged seven, four and three years, on Fri 30 Dec 2011. "Innocent children are dying in large numbers at a rate of two, three or even five children a day after the outbreak of measles," said Antoine Musemena, stating that this requires the political and administrative authorities to address the issue.

The Obundu Distinct surgeon, Dr Lukusa, acknowledged that since the end of November a few cases of measles had been reported accompanied by several deaths. Sick children are being taken care of without payment through the intervention of the international NGO IRC [International Red Cross]. According to Dr. Lukusa, a mass vaccination campaign will have to be be organized to prevent further spread of the spread of the disease. This part of the Eastern Province [Orientale province], around Maniema, is near where a measles epidemic raged a few months ago.

Measles cases confirmed in southwest Kansas
--------------------------------------
GARDEN CITY: Health officials in Finney County have confirmed two cases of measles.The Finney County Health Department is investigating and contacting all those who might be at risk for the disease.

Because of the widespread use of the MMR [Mumps, Measles and Rubella] vaccine, cases in the US are rare, but it kills 200 000 people worldwide each year. Measles is spread through the air by breathing, coughing, or sneezing. It is so contagious that any person who is exposed to it and is not immune will probably will get the disease. Measles can be spread to others from four days before to four days after the rash appears.

There has been no recent report of measles cases in this area, so it must be presumed that the infection has been transmitted from a visitor from elsewhere to the county. Further information is awaited. - Mod.CP]


[Measles remains prevalent worldwide and has reappeared in the USA after a brief absence. The recognition of a fatal case of measles virus infection in the absence of the characteristic measles rash, described above, is a novel observation. - Mod.CP
