[Re: Avian influenza (174) - Viet Nam, Germany, wild birds 20060806.2197,
posted on 6 Aug 2006]:
The item on HPAI in Germany contains the (editorial) correction:
"Last February [2005], Germany suffered an outbreak of H5N1, which can be
fatal to humans, among wild birds, and in April 2006, the virus was detected
among domestic fowl."
The 2005, however, should read 2006. It was, as the text reads, last February.
