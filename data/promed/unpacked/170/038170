From September 2000 and up until the end of that year, the national
salmonella centre at the Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu
(RIVM, the National Institute of Public Health and the Environment)
has noted an explosive increase of isolates of _Salmonella enterica_
subspecies _enterica_ serovar Typhimurium (_S._ Typhimurium)
definitive phage type (DT) 104 from humans, which has since plateaued
at a level double that of previous years (1).
The proportion of cases of DT104 infection (15% of all isolates of
salmonellae in November) in humans in the Netherlands is now among the
highest in Europe. Eurosurveillance Weekly reported outbreaks of this
strain in September 2000 and July-August 2001 (2-7). The 2001 outbreak
was associated with contaminated batches of a sesame seed product in
Sweden, Australia, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Norway. The Dutch
paper examines whether the doubling of the proportion of DT104 in
humans in the Netherlands is a threat to public health and if there
are ways of stopping this development (1).
Resistance of DT104 and subtypes
------------------------------
DT104 is resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin,
sulphonamides, and tetracyclines (ACSSuT). One complication of the
multiresistant character of DT104 is the fact that the pentaresistance
is chromosomally coded and integron mediated. It is therefore unlikely
that reduced use of antimicrobials can reduce its resistance. To an
increasing degree, resistance to trimethoprim and decreased
susceptibility to fluoroquinolones is found abroad. In England in
1994, 1% of all DT104 exhibited decreased susceptibility to
ciprofloxacin, in 1998 16%.
The occurrence of decreased susceptibility to fluoroquinolones is a
great concern as this antimicrobial is used for treating serious
salmonella infections. Also, in the Netherlands, resistance to
trimethoprim and cotrimoxazole is increasing, but resistance to
fluoroquinolones is only sporadic. Of some concern is that the same
pentaresistance property as in DT104 has been identified in isolates
of _Escherichia_ coli from farm animals. Chromosomal exchange of
advantageous attributes across the species barrier is possible and may
occur increasingly with the growing prevalence of resistant DT104
strains.
In the Netherlands, DT104 is further differentiated into the Dutch
phage types 506 and 401 that do not directly correspond with phage
types in the European typing scheme. PT401 occurs least often. In
humans it accounts for 18%, in cattle for 27%, in pigs for 12%, and in
poultry for 5%. PT401 is fully susceptible to chloramphenicol and is
more often susceptible to ampicillin.
Serious clinical course
-------------------------------
Colitis, sepsis, and miscarriage as a result of infection with DT104
have been described in cattle. On the basis of a case-control study in
England and Wales and an outbreak investigation in Denmark in 1998 it
has been suggested that DT104 infection takes a more serious course in
humans compared with other types of salmonellae. A questionnaire
survey was conducted among patients who had had a salmonella infection
in March to May 2001 and whose isolates were received by RIVM.
Information on symptoms, duration of illness, admission to hospital,
use of antibiotic agents, and travel in patients infected with DT104
were compared with patients infected with other phage types of _S._
Typhimurium, or _S._ Enteritidis. As in preceding years, most cases in
both _S._ Typhimurium patient groups were 0-5 year olds and for _S._
Enteritidis were adults older than 20 years.
The observed clinical course of the DT104 infection was severe. The
number of hospital admissions was as high as that reported in England
and Denmark (over 40%), but twice the number of patients had blood in
their stools, and there was one death as a result of infection.
Specimens sent to the laboratory, however, may have been from patients
selected because of the severity of their symptoms. Faecal DT104
specimens sent in were 1.5 times more often sent by a specialist.
The calculated origin of human salmonellosis from an animal reservoir
supported the assumption that types from pigs and cattle (mainly _S._
Typhimurium, especially DT104) are more pathogenic than those from
chickens. Differences in food preparation may also play a part.
Dispersal of manure
----------------------------
An important cause for the explosive increase of DT104 in humans in
2001 is undoubtedly its sustained increase in cattle and pigs. In
addition, the veterinary health service noted in a farm case-control
study (submitted to Prev Vet Med , 2001) that the risk of infection
with _S._ Typhimurium in farms that had bought pig manure was over 20
times higher. Also, the practice of keeping animals inside the modern
dairies was associated with contamination and this practice has been
increasing. The rise in the national dispersal of manure is an
important, fairly new, risk factor for the spread of DT104 and
possibly also for other pathogens. In the Netherlands, discussions
about safer ways to disperse manure and reduce contamination were
started after questions were asked in parliament.
Future and recommendations
--------------------------------
For a period of 12 months from April 2002, all patients with
salmonella infection of whom an isolate has been reported to RIVM by a
regional laboratory are being asked to participate in a case-control
study about the clinical course of their illness and other risk
factors, including possible source foodstuffs, and other routes of
transmission.
The dispersal of manure may be a significant factor in the spread of
DT104. Further investigation into the contamination of manure and the
control of this risk factor should be considered by other countries.
