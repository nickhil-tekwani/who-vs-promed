An anthrax outbreak has killed over 50 head of cattle in Mwenezi over the
past week, causing fear and apprehension among villagers who fear their
beef herd might be decimated by the plague. The hardest hit areas are
Maranda, Neshuro and Rutenga amid calls by villagers for the government to
deploy vaccines.

The outbreak in Mwenezi -- which is one of Masvingo's key beef producers --
has left ranchers worried. Zimbabwe Farmers Union regional manager Mr
Jeremiah Chimwanda confirmed the outbreak, saying efforts were underway to
find ways of containing the outbreak. "We are currently mobilising vaccines
as ZFU, and we will soon be handing over the vaccines to villagers in the
affected areas since we want to preserve our beef herd," said Mr Chimwanda.

Veterinary Service Department officials could not be reached for comment at
the time of going to print.
