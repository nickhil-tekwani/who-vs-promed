Iran Bans Transportation of Fever Animals
------------------------------------------
Iran's veterinary officials have banned the transportation of livestock
from the southeast to the rest of the country after an outbreak of a deadly
fever. The deadly Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF), which has killed
6 people in southeastern Iran this summer, is acquired from bites by ticks
carried by domestic animals.
The daily [newspaper Kayhan said livestock smuggled into Iran from
Afghanistan have infected Iranian animals, which have in turn infected
humans. [Actually, it is infected ticks (infected by biting the animals)
biting the people, not the animals. - Mod.TG
Seven people remain symptomatic and in hospitals.
More than 300 000 domesticated animals have been smuggled into Iran through
the country's eastern borders between March and August 2000, a veterinary
official said during a scientific seminar on the disease in the
southeastern city of Zahedan. "More than 400 000 animals...have been
sprayed [for ticks in the last 2 months since the symptoms of the fever
were first spotted in the province," Ali Asghar Baraee-nejad said.
CCHF causes extensive liver damage resulting in jaundice and even death in
humans. Animal carriers are not affected.
The fever killed 14 people in eastern Iran last year.

[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever has been reported in Iran rarely. With
respect to Afghanistan, in 1998, 19 cases (12 fatal) were reported in
Takar Province -- serological tests were not confirmatory. While this
article refers to an outbreak this summer with 6 deaths, there is also
mention of an outbreak last year in the east of Iran with a resultant 14
deaths, suggesting that CCHF is now "resident" in the country (enzootic).
ProMED-mail would be interested in further information on these outbreaks.

[In nature, the reservoir is believed, by some to be hares and birds and
the _Hyalomma_ spp of ticks in Russia. The reservoir hosts remain undefined
in Africa, but _Hyalomma_ and _Boophilus_ ticks, insectivores and rodents
may be involved. Domestic animals such as sheep, goats, and cattle may act
as amplifying hosts during epizootics. - Mod.TG
