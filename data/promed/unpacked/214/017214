--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Background
Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with dysregulated inflammation. The effects of combination treatment with baricitinib, a Janus kinase inhibitor, plus remdesivir are not known.

Methods
We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating baricitinib plus remdesivir in hospitalized adults with COVID-19. All the patients received remdesivir (10 days or less) and either baricitinib (14 days or less) or placebo (control). The primary outcome was the time to recovery. The key secondary outcome was clinical status at day 15.

Results
A total of 1033 patients underwent randomization (with 515 assigned to combination treatment and 518 to control). Patients receiving baricitinib had a median time to recovery of 7 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 6 to 8), as compared with 8 days (95% CI, 7 to 9) with control (rate ratio for recovery, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.32; P=0.03), and a 30% higher odds of improvement in clinical status at day 15 (odds ratio, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0 to 1.6). Patients receiving high-flow oxygen or noninvasive ventilation at enrollment had a time to recovery of 10 days with combination treatment and 18 days with control (rate ratio for recovery, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.10 to 2.08). The 28-day mortality was 5.1% in the combination group and 7.8% in the control group (hazard ratio for death, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.39 to 1.09). Serious adverse events were less frequent in the combination group than in the control group (16.0% vs. 21.0%; difference, -5.0 percentage points; 95% CI, -9.8 to -0.3; P = 0.03), as were new infections (5.9% vs. 11.2%; difference, -5.3 percentage points; 95% CI, -8.7 to -1.9; P = 0.003).

Conclusions
Baricitinib plus remdesivir was superior to remdesivir alone in reducing recovery time and accelerating improvement in clinical status among patients with COVID-19, notably among those receiving high-flow oxygen or noninvasive ventilation. The combination was associated with fewer serious adverse events.

[In explaining the rationale for this study and noting the continued morbidity and mortality in patients treated with remdesivir alone, the authors explain: "Emerging data suggest that disease severity may be due in part to a dysregulated inflammatory response.(2) It is postulated that mitigating the immune response and preventing a hyperinflammatory state may further improve clinical outcomes. Baricitinib, an orally administered, selective inhibitor of Janus kinase (JAK) 1 and 2, was predicted with the use of artificial intelligence algorithms to be a potential therapeutic against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).(3,4) Baricitinib inhibits the intracellular signaling pathway of cytokines known to be elevated in severe COVID-19, including interleukin-2, interleukin-6, interleukin-10, interferon-gamma, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; acts against SARS-CoV-2 through the impairment of AP2-associated protein kinase 1 and the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry and infectivity; and improves lymphocyte counts in patients with Covid-19.(3,5-8) In 3 case series of patients with Covid-19, baricitinib treatment was associated with both an improvement in oxygenation and a reduction in select inflammatory markers.(9-11) Randomized, controlled trials are needed to further understand the role of immunomodulation in patients with COVID-19.(12) After the successful completion of ACTT-1, we designed the next iteration of ACTT (ACTT-2) to evaluate whether the combination of baricitinib plus remdesivir was superior to remdesivir alone."

In their discussion, the authors mention that the greatest improvements were seen in individuals with moderate disease requiring either supplemental oxygen or high flow oxygen or non-invasive ventilation. Notably, less improvement was seen in critically patients who were already requiring invasive oxygenation (intubation and mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) at the time of enrollment. However, patients with moderate disease treated with the drug combination were less likely to progress to requiring invasive oxygenation when compared with the control group.

The authors also raise the need for clinical trials directly comparing the use of dexamethasone plus remdesivir with baracitinib plus remdesivir, as study designs on the 2 regimens are not comparable.

Over the last week, 8061 and 4575 cases were reported from Nepal and Sri Lanka, respectively, around 2 thousand lower in Nepal, but more than 500 higher in Sri Lanka compared with corresponding records of the previous week, suggesting a declining trend in Nepal while an increasing trend in Sri Lanka. The new cases are stable or in a slightly decreasing trend in Bangladesh as the overall daily case-positivity was below 13% against the number tested across the country. The new cases in Pakistan are increasing a bit, and the overall case-positivity was 7.8% on 10 Dec 2020 against the number of samples tested across the country. Over the week, India's daily new case count was below the mark of 35 000, and on 2 days, it was even below 30 000, indicating a significant reduction of daily new cases in the country compared with the previous week.

To compare the situation in South Asian countries above with previous disease data, ProMED-SoAs readers are referred to the [South Asia Archives]

Re: COVID-19 update (533): Italy 2019, USA reinfection, USA vaccine, WHO, global 20201212.8012530

I am not surprised, but pleased (please understand the real reason) that the tool of epidemiology is powerful and is proven right in this case of laboratory confirmation of SARs-CoV-2 infection in November 2019 in Italy.

In February-March, Indian Government experts had assured us that India had some hidden advantages against the pandemic virus, using Italy-India comparison. Italy had a lot of infections but India had very few. Refuting that argument, we (John TJ, Seshadri MS) did an epidemiological analysis and published the results in Economic and Political Weekly (India) 2020; 55:13-17 with the title "COVID-19 mortality trends and reporting: Comparing India and Italy".

We had concluded with supporting epidemiological evidences that "the start of the epidemic in Italy was by November 2019, even before the world became aware of the Wuhan epidemic and before PCR testing was available". We wrote: "The differences in cumulative numbers infected in India and Italy are largely explained on the basis of earlier and more frequent unrecognized importations of the virus into Italy before an alert came from WHO and before PCR testing was available".

Epidemiology is truly a powerful tool for detective scrutiny of epidemics.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 218 (Samoa has not been added as yet)].

Data by country, area, or territory for 13 Dec 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesDEC13_1607903154.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 53.3% of daily case numbers and 47.6% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours but maintained its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 30.1 million cases. The USA continues to dominate, followed by Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Canada, and Argentina. Other countries reporting more than 1000 cases include Panama, Peru, Chile, Paraguay, Dominican Republic, and Costa Rica. And countries/territories reporting more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000 in the past 24 hours include Ecuador, Puerto Rico, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.

- The European region reported 33.7% of daily case numbers and 39.4% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 21.9 million. Countries not reporting cases today (13 Dec 2020) include Spain, Ukraine, Switzerland, Israel, Sweden, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan among others. Countries reporting more than 10 000 cases in the past 24 hours include Turkey, Russia, UK, Germany, Italy, France, and Poland. There are 21 additional countries reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours and 4 countries reporting more than 500 but less than 1000 cases.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 3.7% of daily case numbers and 5.1% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 4.49 million cases. Iran is dominant, with decreasing daily case counts now below 9 000, followed by Morocco, Pakistan, Palestinian Authority, Jordan, Lebanon, Tunisia, UAE, and Iraq. Oman, Libya, Sudan, and Somalia have not reported any cases in the past 24 hours.

- The African region reported 1.7% of daily case numbers and 1.8% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.62 million cases. South Africa maintains its dominance, reporting more than 7800 new cases, followed by Uganda, Nigeria, Algeria, Burkina Faso, Ghana, DR Congo, Senegal, Mozambique, Angola, and Rwanda. Many countries in the region did not report cases for the last 24 hours, among which are Kenya, Ethiopia, Cameroon, Zambia, Madagascar, Botswana, Namibia, and Zimbabwe.

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.1% of daily case numbers and 0.59% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.96 million cases. Japan is dominant, followed by Malaysia, Philippines, South Korea (having reported over 1000 cases), and China.

- The South East Asia region reported 6.4% of the daily newly reported cases and 5.6% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 11.3 million cases. As previously, India remains dominant, followed by Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Nepal, and the Maldives.

Impression: Basically unchanged on the regional levels with the continued dominance of Europe and the Americas region representing over 86% of both newly confirmed cases and newly reported deaths in the past 24 hours. This is in the face of weekend reporting decreases as seen most clearly in Europe, with high transmission countries not reporting to WHO in the past 24 hours. At the country level, South Korea continues climbing in daily reports with the most recent over 1000 cases. Indonesia reported over 6000 cases. Iran may have "peaked" as seen by decreasing daily new cases. South Africa reported over 8000 new cases. Mexico has a significant presence in the Americas with reports of over 12 000 cases. The USA maintains its position as the country reporting the most cases on a daily basis, now reporting almost 250 000 cases in the past 24 hours, in spite of weekend reporting slowdowns.

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (187 901), Russia (28 080), India (27 336), Turkey (26 919), and Brazil (21 395), have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 7366 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (12-13 Dec 2020)

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (9 countries) include the USA, Russia, India, Turkey, Brazil, UK (18 447), Italy (17 937), Germany (17 891), and France (11 533). A total of 53 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours, compared with 62 on Fri 11 Dec 2020; 26 of the 53 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 11 are from the Americas region, 8 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 4 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and one from the African region. Countries not reporting newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours include Spain, Switzerland, Sweden, Costa Rica, among others, consistent with previously noted weekend reductions in reporting.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 21.7%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 0.81%.
