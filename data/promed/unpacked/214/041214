Novel Picornavirus Associated with Avian Keratin Disorder in Alaskan Birds
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract
--------
Avian keratin disorder (AKD), characterized by debilitating overgrowth of the avian beak, was 1st documented in black-capped chickadees (_Poecile atricapillus_) in Alaska. Subsequently, similar deformities have appeared in numerous species across continents. Despite the widespread distribution of this emerging pathology, the cause of AKD remains elusive. As a result, it is unknown whether suspected cases of AKD in the afflicted species are causally linked, and the impacts of this pathology at the population and community levels are difficult to evaluate. We applied unbiased, metagenomic next-generation sequencing to search for candidate pathogens in birds affected with AKD. We identified and sequenced the complete coding region of a novel picornavirus, which we are calling poecivirus. Subsequent screening of 19 AKD-affected black-capped chickadees and 9 control individuals for the presence of poecivirus revealed that 19/19 (100 percent) AKD-affected individuals were positive, while only 2/9 (22 percent) control individuals were infected with poecivirus. Two northwestern crows (_Corvus caurinus_) and 2 red-breasted nuthatches (_Sitta canadensis_) with AKD-consistent pathology also tested positive for poecivirus. We suggest that poecivirus is a candidate etiological agent of AKD.

The gross beak deformities termed "avian keratin disorder" (AKD) were 1st reported in back-capped chickadees (BCCH) in Alaska in the late 1990s. AKD is an emerging disease of wild birds that has been increasing both in geographic scope and in the variety of species affected. The strong association between poecivirus and AKD in BCCH suggests that this is a promising candidate for the etiological agent of this disease. The available data suggest that mortality rates from this disease can be high among the adult breeding population; this could result in deterministic population declines if individuals are dying faster than they are replaced by recruitment of juveniles or migrants, for which it is of concern for the conservation of avian biodiversity. - Mod.PMB
