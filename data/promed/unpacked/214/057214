[Canada has recently issued a publication regarding their surveillance program for chronic wasting disease (CWD) of cervids. The title of the survey and several paragraphs of this 7 page report are reported below. - Mod.TG]

Ontario Chronic Wasting Disease Surveillance Program - 2011 Progress Report

Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal disease which infects members of the cervidae family. CWD is caused by abnormally folded proteins called prions, which cause lesions on the brain and often leads to death. The disease is not known to infect any species outside the cervidae family. It has become endemic in several states in the western United States (i.e. Colorado and Wyoming) and has been identified in 2 western Canadian provinces (Alberta and Saskatchewan). More recently, the disease has also gained a foothold in the eastern United States in several states (i.e. Wisconsin, West Virginia). Currently, CWD is not known to exist in Ontario, but has been discovered in 3 bordering states; New York (2005), Minnesota (2002), and Michigan (2008). In the primary infection area of the western US, white-tailed deer, elk, and mule deer have been shown to be very susceptible to CWD, and a small number of moose in Colorado have also tested positive for CWD.

During the 2011 Ontario chronic wasting disease (CWD) surveillance program a total of 483 white-tailed deer and 12 elk samples were collected and sampled from the Peterborough-Bancroft area. All samples were collected between October and November of 2011. The sample size target for this area was 460 samples, which was exceeded. All test results proved negative for presence of CWD prions. To the best of our knowledge, this area of Ontario that was tested during 2011 still remains CWD free.

Populations of white-tailed deer appeared to be healthy in the Peterborough-Bancroft area during the fall of 2011. The vast majority of our samples were collected during the 1st week of the firearm hunt (7-12 Nov 2011). The weather conditions during this week were quite warm, but anecdotally most hunters appeared to have a successful hunt, with the hunters in WMU [wildlife management unit] 57 possibly having been more successful than in other WMUs sampled. Hunters continue to support the surveillance program and express concern about the possible future entry of CWD into Ontario's deer herd. Several hunting camps remarked that MNR crews had tested their samples during the previous surveillance campaign in 2006. Awareness about CWD in the general Ontario hunting community appears to be high, but specific knowledge about CWD appears to be vague amongst most hunters. The news in neighbouring jurisdictions to Ontario in 2011 was mostly positive. Minnesota discovered their 1st case of CWD in a wild deer in 2010 in the southeast part of the state and initiated an intense response action. 2300 deer were tested for CWD in the area surrounding the 2010 case, all tested negative for CWD. It is too early to tell yet, but the Minnesota response may be another successful example of vigorous surveillance, early detection, and rapid response halting a CWD outbreak. Further positive news came from both New York State and Michigan who did not register any further cases of CWD in 2011 since their initial cases in 2005 and 2008 respectively. At a broader scale, there appear to be 2 outbreaks of CWD in eastern North America. One large outbreak is in the Wisconsin-Illinois area that has persisted since 2002 and may be responsible for the recent Minnesota case. This outbreak area is approximately 550 km [340 mi] west of the Ontario border. The 2nd, more recent outbreak area, is in the West Virginia-Virginia-Maryland area. It is relatively smaller and less intense but may be spreading. This outbreak is approximately 400 km [250 mi] southeast of the Ontario border.
