Equine infectious anaemia (EIA) has been detected in a horse in
Devon, after the owner requested a private vet to examine a sick
horse, Defra confirmed today [Sat 11 Sep 2010].

The premise is currently under restriction, and the infected horse
will be humanely destroyed in line with existing regulations. The
other 2 horses on the premises are currently being tested for
evidence of infection.

The horse has been in this country for 2 years and only became ill
very recently. The investigation into the origin of this case is
ongoing.

Chief Veterinary Officer Nigel Gibbens said: "The risk of notifiable
exotic disease is ever present. This case demonstrates the importance
of owners being vigilant and identifying illness in their animals and
consulting their vet, who should then report any signs of exotic
disease to the Animal Health Agency."

Notes
1. Equine infectious anaemia is a virus disease of horses causing
intermittent fever, anaemia, emaciation and death. It can be
transmitted by the exchange of blood by biting insects and occurs
typically in low-lying swampy areas.

2. EIA is not a zoonotic disease. The Health Protection Agency advice
is that EIA is not a risk to human health and that there is no
evidence that this outbreak presents a risk to the local community.

3. A notifiable disease is a disease named in section 88 of the
Animal Health Act 1981 or an Order made under that Act and must be
reported.

4. This disease occurs in horses, mules and donkeys. Animals may be
acutely, chronically or subclinically affected. The incubation period
is variable, from a matter of days to a few months but generally 1-3
weeks. Antibodies usually develop 7 to 14 days after infection and
last for life.

5. For an animal testing positively for EIA, the only course of
action is to humanely put it down. This may be for the welfare of the
affected horse, but also to protect other horses from infection. Once
infected, horses are infected for life and can pose a risk to other
horses in close proximity. We have agreed with equine industry
veterinary surgeons that destruction is the only policy. This
response is in accordance with both the Infectious Disease of Horses
Order 1987 and the Specified Disease (Notification and Slaughter)
Order 2006.

6. Defra also confirmed on 7 Sep 2010 that EIA was detected in a
horse in Northumberland as part of routine post import testing
following import from the Netherlands [see commentary]. At present,
there is no known link between the cases [in Northumberland and in
Devon], and the investigation is ongoing.

[From the above information, it appears that the infected horse had
been imported to the UK 2 years ago. It will be interesting to obtain
the identity of its country(s) of origin; whether it had been tested
for EIA prior to the importation; and whether it has shared, during
or following its introduction to the UK, premises including other
imported horses. In case affirmative, the EIA status of these
animals, in particular their EIA testing history, is of interest as
well.

On 7 Sep 2010, the UK submitted to the OIE an immediate notification
on a case of EIA in Northumberland; a follow-up report was sent on 10
Sep 2010. Both, as well as a map, are available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=9682>.

The report included the following epidemiological comments: "The
horses were introduced to the UK as legal imports [from the
Netherlands] on 15 Aug 2010. They were subjected to documentary,
identity, and physical checks as part of routine post-import testing.
These checks disclosed documentary irregularities, and, as a result,
the horses were sampled for EIA on 1 Sep 2010. One horse was
confirmed as positive for EIA by AGID (Coggin's) test, and the
premises and all horses on it have been placed under restriction. The
remaining 5 imported horses were confirmed negative by AGID. All
horses on the premises are being sampled and tested today (7 Sep
2010). The veterinary epidemiology inquiry is ongoing." - Mod.AS]
