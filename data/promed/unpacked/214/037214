The World Health Organization said on [Mon 8 Jan 2018] that 3 people in South Sudan have died of a suspected viral haemorrhagic fever and 60 of their contacts are being monitored for any infection.

Ebola, Marburg, and yellow fever are among viral hemorrhagic fevers that have caused deadly outbreaks in Africa. More than 11 300 people died during the worst outbreak of Ebola, a highly contagious disease, which mainly affected Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone from 2013 to 2016.

The 3 people in South Sudan -- a pregnant woman, teenage girl, and boy -- all died in December [2017] and were from the same village in Yirol East county in the Eastern Lakes state. But there had been no known contact among them, it said.

No tissue or blood samples were collected from their bodies for analysis, and South Sudan health authorities reported the cases on [28 Dec 2017], the WHO said in a statement.

"The outbreak of suspected viral haemorrhagic fever in South Sudan could rapidly evolve, and critical information including laboratory confirmation of the etiology of disease is needed to direct response efforts," it said.

National health authorities and WHO are investigating and have found evidence of zoonotic haemorrhagic illness in goats and sheep in the area, including some deaths, as well as deaths among wild birds at the time, it added.

[Since no samples were taken from the 3 fatal cases, it is unlikely that a definitive diagnosis will be reached. There have been undiagnosed cases of hemorrhagic disease in South Sudan several times before. In 2016, there was an outbreak of hemorrhagic disease. Unfortunately, despite the efforts of several reference laboratories, the etiological agent of that South Sudan hemorrhagic fever outbreak was not determined. In that outbreak, several possible viruses were discarded by laboratory tests (see Undiagnosed hemorrhagic illness - South Sudan (02): addtl. information 20160625.4309572). In 1999, an outbreak of hemorrhagic disease occurred in the southern part of Sudan due to infections with the bacterium _Borrelia recurrentis_, the cause of louse-borne relapsing fever.

If the cases of hemorrhagic illness in goats and sheep and death in birds is related to the 3 current human cases, yellow fever virus infection is unlikely. However, these zoonotic cases may be unrelated to the human ones, and perhaps are due to Rift Valley fever virus infections.
