Q-fever in the Netherlands: Vaccination strategy -- 2009
-----------------------------------------
a. [History Q fever in animals, Netherlands]

1. 2005: _Coxiella burnetii_ was 1st identified as the cause of
abortion on 2 dairy-goat farms in the Netherlands.
2. 2006: Q-fever outbreaks diagnosed on 6 dairy-goat farms and one
dairy-sheep farm
3. 2007: Q-fever outbreaks diagnosed on 7 dairy-goat farms
4. 2008: Q-fever outbreaks diagnosed on 7 dairy-goat farms and one
dairy-sheep farm.

b. [History Q fever in humans, Netherlands]

1. Period 1997-2006: N=93.
2. Period 1 Jan 2007-4 Mar 2009
2007: N=192; 2008: N=958, 2009: N=3

Experts believe there is a connection between the outbreaks on goat
and sheep dairy farms and the human outbreak, [since] large amounts
of _Coxiella burnetii_ are spread by infected animals mainly via
feces and in case of abortions.

c. Measures taken in 2008:

1. Notification obligation for goat and sheep farms in case of high
abortion rates:

- For farms with less than 100 animals: 3 abortions within 30 days
- For larger farms: greater than 5 percent abortion of pregnant
animals within 30 days

2. Restrictions for infected farms:

- No visitors allowed in the stable for 3 months
- No manure may be removed from the stable for 3 months

d. Vaccination of animals:

1. 2008 - voluntary, applied vaccine "Q-fever vaccine Coxevac,"
Produced by CEVA (already in large scale use in France; not
authorized, but application has been submitted).
2. Technical details: Inactivated, no adjuvants; 100 g/mL antigen.

e. Measures that will be taken in 2009:

1. Notification obligation for goat and sheep farms in case of high
abortion rates (same as in 2008)
2. Compulsory vaccination of "high risk" goat and sheep farms of the
Netherlands: Large dairy-goat and dairy-sheep farms (at least 50
animals), and Goat/sheep farms with a public function (e.g.
children's petting farms)
3. Voluntary vaccination in the rest of the Netherlands
4. Hygiene protocol, which is in part mandatory
5. Extra research

[Netherlands has become Europe's heaviest Q-fever-infected country,
with significant public health concern. Consequent to the unusually
extensive infection in humans, in 3 provinces, special preventive and
control measures in animals have been applied. During the due 2009
season, compulsory vaccination will be carried out, involving goat
and sheep herds, which are regarded "at risk" according to their size
or to their status as having a "public function" potentially exposing
humans to infection.

Subscribers are referred to the above URL of the presentation for
additional information, including maps and diagrams illustrating
possible transmission routes of Q-fever. Dr Christianne Bruschke, the
presenter, is Alternate to the Chief Veterinary Officer of the
Netherlands and a member of the Steering Council of the European
Technology Platform for Global Animal Health (ETPGAH).

Information on the results ascribed to these steps, as well as their
impact on the rate of human infection, is anticipated with great interest.
