An imported case of acute chikungunya fever virus infection returning
[to France] from Benin was serologically confirmed at the University
Hospital of Bordeaux, France. The patient's trip was planned from 20
Oct - 2 Dec 2010, and shortened because of an acute algo-febrile
presentation on 30 Nov [2010]. On 20 Dec [2010], he was admitted in
our unit because of persistent asthenia and severe incapacitating
arthralgia mainly located on neck, elbows, and wrists and was
subsequently investigated for the condition.

[Although chikungunya virus (CHKV) was transmitted in southern France
during warm weather following importation of the virus in 2010 (see
ProMED-mail archive number 20100926.3495), there was no risk of
ongoing CHIKV transmission in Bordeaux at the season of the year of
the imported case above. This report is of interest because
ProMED-mail receives few reports of CHKV infections in Africa, where
it is endemic. This is the 1st report of CHKV transmission in Benin.
Drs Receveur, Boidin, and Malvy are thanked for this first-hand
report. It will be interesting to learn how long the patient's
arthralgia persists. A recent study reported that on average, 2 years
after infection 43 per cent to 75 per cent of CHKV-infected people
reported prolonged or late-onset symptoms (arthralgia) highly
attributable to infection by this virus (see ProMED-mail archive
number 20110115.0178).
