Fulminant Myocarditis Associated With Pandemic
H1N1 Influenza A Virus in Children
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Acute myocarditis is a well-recognized, albeit
rare, manifestation of numerous viral infections
(1) with a broad spectrum of symptoms and
clinical features (2). Fulminant myocarditis may
present with fatal arrhythmias, atrioventricular
block, and/or varying degrees of cardiogenic
shock (3). The prevalence of myocardial
involvement in influenza infection ranges from 0
to 11 percent depending on the diagnostic
criteria used to define myocarditis (4).
Fulminant myocarditis is an uncommon
complication, typically diagnosed in association
with circulatory collapse or at autopsy in
patients with influenza- associated fatal
outcomes (5). A few case reports and series
(6­8) represent the incidental diagnoses of
influenza-associated acute fulminant myocarditis,
but the true prevalence remains unknown. Here we
present the first known report of acute
myocarditis in pediatric population associated
with the present pandemicH1N1 influenza A virus
infection. Four cases occurred within a 30-day
period, and 3 of them were diagnosed as fulminant
myocarditis with fatal or near-fatal outcomes.

A retrospective chart review was conducted on all
patients admitted to Rady Children's Hospital­San
Diego with the diagnosis of H1N1 influenza A
infection during October 2009. Criteria for
fulminant myocarditis included echocardiographic
and clinical evidence of severely decreased left
ventricular systolic function and/or lymphocytic
infiltration of the myocardium documented at autopsy.

Within a 30-day period, 80 children were admitted
with H1N1 influenza A infection to Rady
Children's Hospital­SanDiego. Serum troponin I
and creatine phosphokinase myocardial band levels
were obtained in 11 children, and
echocardiography was performed in 8 children. We
included 4 H1N1 influenza­associated myocarditis
cases based on elevated cardiac enzymes (n = 2),
significant acute decrease in left ventricular
systolic function demonstrated by the
echocardiogram (n = 3), or histologic evidence of
severe myocarditis . Three children presented
with fulminant myocarditis, 1 with a fatal
outcome and 2 requiring extracorporeal membrane
oxygenation support. None of the children with
fulminant myocarditis had evidence of sepsis or
bacterial infection (negative blood, urine, and
tracheal aspirate cultures). Two of the 3
children with decreased systolic function
experienced recovery in 5 to 7 days. All 4
children had a positive rapid influenza enzyme
immunoassay test result from a nasopharyngeal
swab sample that was subsequently confirmed as
H1N1 by reverse- transcriptase polymerase chain
reaction performed at the San Diego County Department of Health.

Fulminant myocarditis due to viral infection is
an uncommon form of acute myocarditis. Influenza
A virus­associated fulminant myocarditis is
exceedingly rare, with only a few cases reported
in the literature. We report the 1st 4 cases of
acute myocarditis in children associated with the
pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus, all occurring
within a 30- day period. Our tertiary care
hospital serves a geographic region that includes
approximately 800 000 children. During the past 3
years, there was an annual average of 2 cases of
acute myocarditis due to suspected viral
etiology, none of which had evidence of influenza
infection. Within a 30-day period in October
2009, there were 3 cases of acute fulminant
myocarditis and 1 case of acute perimyocarditis
at Rady Children's Hospital­San Diego, all
associated with confirmed H1N1 influenza A
infection. There was serologic,
echocardiographic, and/or histologic evidence of
myocardial involvement in all cases . Three
children had echocardiographic evidence of an
acutely decreased myocardial function. One child
died likely due to acute atrioventricular block,
as suggested by severe lymphocytic infiltration
of the conduction system. Two children required
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support with
gradual improvement of the ventricular systolic
function over a 1-week period, which is typically
observed in patients with fulminant myocarditis (2).

The prevalence of influenza-associated fulminant
myocarditis is not known because of the lack of
comprehensive screening, with only a handful of
clinical cases and autopsy findings reported in
the literature (5­8). Our documented 4 cases
within a 30-day period, compared with our
previous experience, raise the possibility that
the novel [pandemic] H1N1 influenza A virus is
more commonly associated with a severe form of
myocarditis than previously encountered influenza strains.

Our observations warrant a high index of
suspicion for myocarditis in children with H1N1
influenza A infection. Early detection and
aggressive management are paramount. Timely
intervention with circulatory support may
decrease morbidity and mortality, with the
potential for a favorable cardiac prognosis.
