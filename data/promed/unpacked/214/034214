Summary
-------
A total of 57 cases of West Nile virus (WNV) infections (54 with
neuroinvasive infection and 3 with fever) were identified in Romania
between July and October 2010. The median age of the cases was 53.4 years,
with the highest incidence in the age group 60Â­69 years. The case fatality
rate was 8.8 per cent. Cases were distributed in 19 districts in the
southern, western, central and eastern parts of the country. Molecular
investigation revealed lineage 2 West Nile virus, related to the Volgograd
2007 strain.

Discussion
----------
With 52 confirmed cases of WNV infection widely distributed in the country,
the 2010 transmission season was associated with the most important WNV
infection outbreak since 1997, when the WNV surveillance system was
implemented in Romania.

Weather conditions (rainfalls, high temperatures) in 2010 were favourable
to the increase of mosquito populations. _Culex pipiens_ had already been
identified as the vector of WNV in the 1996 outbreak. In late summer, at
least in urban areas, _Cx. pipiens_ is the main mosquito biting humans, and
we may assume that in this type of environment, this species was the WNV
vector in 2010 also.

A specific feature of this outbreak was its extended area in the country:
cases were distributed in 19 districts, with some concentration of cases in
the south eastern district of Constanta and in urban areas such as Blaj
(western part) and Bucharest. Although most cases occurred in the already
known endemic area in the south (in the Danube lowland and Delta
neighbouring counties), in the 2010 transmission season, cases were also
recorded in previously unaffected areas, from the valleys of other major
rivers, known to be bird migration pathways.

Partial sequencing of the NS5 gene from a WNV-positive serum of a Bucharest
resident revealed a virus strain belonging to the genetic lineage 2, highly
similar (99.3 percent) to the Volgograd strain involved in the 2007 WNV
outbreak in the Volga Delta area. It is unsure whether the same WNV strain
was involved in the outbreak beyond the Carpathian Mountains in
Transylvania in 2010. Lineage 2 WNV strains were previously thought to be
of low virulence.

Nevertheless recent studies in South Africa suggest that lineage 2 WNV
strains are a cause of neurological disease in horses and humans. The WNV
strain circulating in Romania from the 1996 epidemic belonged to the
genetic lineage 1 and was associated with a case fatality rate of 4.3
percent (an 8.8 percent rate was recorded in 2010). In conclusion, a change
in the epidemiological profile of WNV infection was recorded in 2010 in
Romania, with emergence of cases in previously unaffected areas in western
and eastern parts of the country, and the emergence of a neuroinvasive
lineage 2 WNV strain.

[West Nile virus (WNV) infections in humans have been occurring in Romania
for several years (see below). This past transmission WNV season (2010) was
particularly active in Eastern Europe, including Romania. The above report
raises the total individuals infected from 41 (with 4 deaths) reported on
20 Sep 2010 (see ProMED-mail archive number 20100922.3428) to 54 with 5
deaths through October 2010.
