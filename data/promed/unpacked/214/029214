Swine-origin triple reassortant influenza A(H3N2) viruses in North
America - ECDC Risk Assessment
------------------------------------
Conclusions and recommendations:
Following recent infections in children in North America with a
swine-origin triple reassortant influenza A(H3N2) virus that includes
a genetic component from the pandemic [H1N1] 2009 virus, and with
probable human-to-human transmission of these viruses, ECDC has come
to the following preliminary opinion:

- These viruses are known to be found in pigs in North America, but
they have not been found in pigs in Europe (EU/EEA countries).
However, surveillance for influenza in pigs is weak in both North
America and Europe, and surveillance for infections in humans in close
contact with pigs is notably weak in Europe. Hence, all such
statements on the epidemiology of swine influenzas must be treated
with caution.
- Most of the US cases experienced only mild disease. Those
hospitalised had underlying conditions, and all patients recovered
completely.
- These viruses are susceptible to the neuraminidase inhibitors
(oseltamivir and zanamivir) though the current A(H3N2) component of
seasonal influenza vaccines is unlikely to provide protection. Older
people are likely to have some protection from exposure to earlier
vaccines.
- It is considered by the United States Centers for Disease Control
(CDC) that there had already been some very limited human-to-human
transmission of these and similar viruses in the US.
- Unlike in March 2009 (the start of the pandemic), there are no
reports of numbers of unexplained influenza infections elsewhere in
the Americas. Hence, it is unlikely that these US cases represent
outliers for a larger phenomenon.
- Overall, therefore, the immediate direct threat to human health in
Europe is low.
- ECDC staff are following the situation closely and are in direct
contact with the WHO, the US CDC and relevant experts in EU Member
States.
- There is a need to ensure that these infections could be detected
through diagnostic testing in European national influenza
laboratories.
- There are strong public health arguments for more active
virological surveillance of pig herds in Europe (and North America)
including active surveillance of infections in humans that are in
direct or indirect contact with pigs.
- Equally justified are more formal approaches to assessing emerging
influenza viruses for their pandemic potential, and such virological
risk assessments should continue to be developed.
- Unusual influenza viruses should continue to be referred to
National Influenza Centres and on to the WHO Collaborating Centre in
Europe, along with relevant clinical and epidemiological data.

Public Health Issue:
[There is] implication for Europe of recent human infection and
limited probable human-to-human transmission in the United States with
triple reassortant swine-origin influenza S-OtrA(H3N2) viruses with a
unique gene segment combination including the M gene from the 2009
A(H1N1) pandemic viruses.

However, since these are now seasonal viruses and no other human
adapted A(H1N1) viruses have been found in the last Northern and
Southern seasons in this risk assessment, they will generally be
referred to as A(H1N1) in text for brevity. Swine influenza viruses
are generally designated as S-O to indicate swine origin.

Disease background information:
Animal infection and disease: Swine influenza is an acute viral
infection of the respiratory tract in pigs. The mortality in pigs is
low, and recovery usually occurs within 7-10 days. An infected pig may
have rapid onset of fever, loss of appetite, laboured abdominal
breathing and coughing, but subclinical infections are common. The
infections are considered endemic in pigs in Europe and elsewhere in
the world. Serological surveys indicate that a significant proportion
of all pigs are infected during their lifetimes. Unlike human
influenza in temperate countries, there is no seasonal pattern for
influenza among pigs. However, surveillance of influenza in pigs
remains incomplete and patchy even in Europe and the USA, mostly
because swine influenza has little significance for food production
and food safety. There is little relevant legislation, and swine
producers are reluctant to allow voluntary testing.

Swine influenza is not a notifiable animal disease in the EU, and
there is no extensive surveillance. The most relevant EU data come
from research work in a limited number of countries supported by the
European Commission. Given the limitations of surveillance in Europe,
statements on the epidemiology and virology of swine influenza in
Europe can only be preliminary. The swine influenza subtypes currently
circulating in pigs in Europe are known to include A(H1N1)i, A(H3N2)ii
and A(H1N2). Recently, a reassortant pandemic A(H1N1) influenza
influenza virus has been identified circulating among pigs in Germany.
These are swine influenzas not human influenzas.

The epidemiology and virology of swine influenza viruses in Europe and
the United States seem to be quite different. The triple reassortant
viruses, S-OtrA(H3N2) seen in pigs and humans in the USA have not been
found in Europe to date. The main swine influenza viruses circulating
in US pig herds in recent years have been swine triple reassortant
A(H1N1) viruses, A(H3N2) and A(H1N2) viruses. An important point is
that there is little if any movement of live pigs between continents.
Indeed, it is not legal for live pigs to be imported from the USA to
Europe. Hence, there is little risk of spread of the American viruses
to pigs in Europe. This is in contrast to the situation, for example,
of the transmission of avian influenza through movement of wild birds
and trade in domestic poultry. It is considered that there is no risk
to humans of acquiring infections with swine influenza from
consumption of food.

Infection with swine influenza virus has occasionally been detected in
humans since the 1950s. Because of weaknesses in surveillance,
statements on how common these infections are in humans must be made
with caution. Human disease is usually clinically similar to disease
caused by infections with human influenza viruses. Complications have
only rarely been reported in the literature, although they have
occurred even in otherwise healthy adults. An exception is a well
known 1976 outbreak of swine influenza among young, essentially
healthy adult military recruits at a basic-training centre in New
Jersey (Fort Dix). This was caused by a swine-origin A(H1N1) virus and
resulted in at least 230 infections, 13 of whom experienced severe
disease, and one death of a previously healthy man. After intense
local transmission over a one-month period, that virus was then never
observed again. Hence, the pandemic 2009 A(H1N1) virus is so far the
only swine-origin virus that has shown the capacity to spread rapidly
between humans.

Serological surveys undertaken in North America among persons working
with pigs have shown that they quite often have evidence of prior
infection with swine influenza viruses. Interpretation of
sero-prevalence data can be difficult due to cross-reactivity (i.e.
infection with a seasonal influenza virus might be misinterpreted as
indicating prior swine influenza infection). There are few
contemporary serological data from humans for Europe [17].

Overall Conclusion:
The viruses in question have not been seen in pigs in Europe (EU/EEA),
but there has been swine-to-human transmission in Europe with European
viruses. However, there are no reports of anything but mild,
self-limiting illness and no ongoing transmission. The clinical
picture is in stark contrast to avian influenza A(H5N1) infections.
