The cloudy weather and incessant rain in the last few days, experts at
Punjab Agricultural University [PAU] say, is good for wheat, sugarcane and
oilseed crops. The news might not be all that good for potato crops,
though, which could see some rise in late blight due to the rain. Dr GS
Bains, head of PAU's Department of Agrometeorology, said that the maximum
temperature was much lower and the minimum temperature was higher than normal.
Plant pathologists highlight that there are chances of further development
of the disease in potato. The farmers should follow the recommendations of
PAU on the management of late blight of potato. The current weather
conditions are highly conducive for development and spread of late blight.
Isolated incidences of the disease have been observed in Hoshiarpur and
some adjoining areas.
Due to favourable weather, the disease can spread to other areas too. The
farmers of Hoshiarpur, Kapurthala, Jalandhar, Nawanshar and Ropar should
follow the recommendations of the university, say the experts.

Late blight, a fungal disease that affects potato crops, has returned to
haunt farmers here [Punjab] and the Punjab Agricultural University has
issued an alert to growers after coming across fresh infections in a farm
in Hoshiarpur district.
"We have found the attack of late blight disease at one potato farm at
Tanda in Hoshiarpur which has damaged the entire crop sown at one acre
field," H S Rewal, head of the Department of Plant Pathology at PAU said on
Wednesday [19 Dec 2007].
Stating that the current weather conditions are conducive to the
development and spread of disease on other fields also, he asked farmers to
spray recommended fungicide on their farms to protect their crop. "Since
this disease is weather dependent and develops very fast during high
humidity, the present weather conditions are quite favourable to
development of late blight attack on crops," he said.

"This year potato cultivators will face immense problems from the Dhasa
[potato blight] disease," said Mr Tapan Kumar Sarkar, district plant
protection officer of Jalpaiguri. "Throughout Jalpaiguri district all the
cold storages have affected seed [potatoes]. We apprised the cultivators of
Jalpaiguri not to use the affected seed as last year [2006] a majority of
potatoes were affected by Dhasa. But the farmers are not accepting our
proposal as they want to buy potatoes from local markets," said Mr Sarkar.
Mr Shekh Anwar Hussein, the principal agriculture officer of Jalpaiguri
said, "We have started campaigning throughout the district to make the
cultivators aware. The methods are being advertised in leaflets, paper and
television in all the regions. The farmers should be aware about the
diseases. If the farmer used the local seed then they should purify the
seed using certain methods which are there in the leaflets. As affected
seed will destroy all the potatoes they should not be used."

[Potato late blight (PLB) is caused by the fungus _Phytophthora infestans_,
which can also infect other solanaceous crops such as tomato or eggplant.
It is one of the most important potato diseases worldwide and affects
leaves as well as tubers. The fungus is spread by plant material (including
seed tubers), wind and water, and solanaceous weeds can serve as pathogen
reservoirs. Other fungi and bacteria often invade blight-infected tubers
resulting in total tuber breakdown. Disease management includes
preventative fungicide treatments of seed tubers, but it appears that this
has been a problem in the regions mentioned in the reports above.
In India, infected seed potatoes are typically the main source of disease
inoculum, and losses of up to 75 per cent have been reported previously in
some areas. In the subtropical plains, conditions favourable for PLB are
generally limited, but in the hills the conditions are highly congenial for
the disease. Several PLB resistant varieties are being deployed around the
country and a forecasting model has been developed to determine the timing
of fungicide applications.
Worldwide, considerable variation in aggressiveness between different
isolates of _P. infestans_ has been observed. A severe form of PLB was
responsible for the Irish potato famine in the late 1840s. PLB is
considered an increasing problem in many areas, including India, because
new and even more virulent strains continue to emerge. Some of these can
destroy a potato plant in a matter of hours and a complete crop within days.
There are 2 mating types of the fungus, A1 and A2. Where both are present,
reproduction occurs sexually as well as asexually, leading to greater
variation and fitter strains with higher fungicide resistance and increased
yield losses. A1 was the 1st mating type to spread worldwide; A2 began to
spread later and was 1st recorded in India in the northwestern hills in
1990. It is now also present in northern Europe, northern and Central
America, and other parts of Asia.
