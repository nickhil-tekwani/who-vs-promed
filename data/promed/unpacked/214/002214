A 4th person with viral haemorragic fever (VHF) symptoms has died.
The virus has already claimed the lives of a Zambian national and 2
other people at the Morningside Clinic in Johannesburg. The woman was
a cleaner at the clinic.

The National Health Department has issued an alert in Gauteng
following these deaths. Unconfirmed tests indicate they may have died
of [a] fatal viral haemorragic fever. An Outbreak Response and
Tracking Team has been set up to contain any further spread. The
department's Zanele Mngadi says investigations are still underway
into the cause of the deaths.

Mngadi confirmed the death of the 4th person, who was admitted at the
Leratong hospital last night [5 Oct 2008]. The patient, who showed
symptoms of VHF, was transferred to the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg
Academic Hospital, where she died. The health department says there
is no need for South Africans to panic. The department's Frew Denson
says the fever is highly contagious but is only transmitted through
body fluids.

It is reported that the virus can kill a person within 72 hours. VHF
is an extremely infectious and life-threatening disease caused by
[several different] viruses, including Ebola virus. The death rate
[in the case of Ebola virus] can be as high as 90 percent. Symptoms
vary but include fever, vomiting, diarrhea and bleeding.

I have just read the posting (Undiagnosed fatalities - South Africa
ex Zambia: RFI 20081005.3139) on your site, and it appears to be
rather misleading. The chronological order of events (as I can
gather) is as follows (None of this information has yet been confirmed.):

4 Sep 2008 - Index Case - female South African, (living in Zambia for
many years) begins to suffer from flu-like symptoms.

9 Sep 2008 - She is slowly deteriorating. She sees multiple doctors in Lusaka.

11 Sep 2008 - She is admitted to hospital and deteriorates over night.

12 Sep 2008 - Paramedic is called in to evacuate her to South Africa.
He does the transfer, along with another Dr assisting.

13 Sep 2008 - Index Case dies.

14 Sep 2008 Paramedic starts to develop flu-like symptoms.

14-27 Sep 2008 - Paramedic slowly deteriorates.

27 Sep 2008 - Paramedic is diagnosed as very sick and medivaced to
South Africa. Nurse who treated Index case begins to get flu-like symptoms.

30 Sep 2008 - Paramedic dies.

1 Oct 2008 - Nurse who treated Index Case is admitted to hospital.

5 Oct 2008 - Nurse who treated Index Case dies.

The information that I can gather is the following:

1. Incubation period is as little as 2 days (paramedic), but as long
as 14 days (nurse).

2. Disease course is generally 4-7 days of flu-like illness with
patient only becoming critically ill in 2nd week of disease.

3. Further information is that Index Case reportedly had an eschar on
one of her feet, thought to be from a tick-bite. She had also been in
contact with horses from Congo in the weeks preceding her illness.
Transmission is hypothesized to be by 2 means: tick-borne 1st (which
may have brought the disease into the human population from the
animal population) followed by direct contact with bodily fluids
(resulting in human to human transmission).

4. It appears further hospital staff are now critically ill in
Zambia, though this has not been confirmed.

5. If the incubation period is as long as 2 weeks, then we should
still be closely watching all "contact-cases" for any signs of the
disease. Those in contact with the Index case should be in the clear
by now, while those in contact with the paramedic and the nurse (as
well as any hospital staff who are currently sick) are still at high
risk. One should probably work on a 21-day incubation
period/quarantine period to be safe.

6. Chances are this is a new virus (or new subtype of virus) in the
[family _Filoviridae_]. The only 2 known viruses in this group are
Ebola and Marburg. It looks as though [the infection] may have
entered Zambia from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
through a tick (carried on a horse), but again this cannot be confirmed.

This comment assumes that labs in South Africa have already tested
all known VHFs. It is unlikely to be pneumonic plague, as this would
have been discovered in South Africa; however, it is still a
possibility that this [putative] viral disease has been in the
Southern Province of Zambia (and that the 4 reported cases seen there
were not diagnosed or wrongly called pneumonic plague).

7. The important steps in control are 1. effective quarantine of sick
patients, and 2. monitoring of all "in-contact" cases, with
quarantine as soon as any signs of flu or fever are noted. The
government should also ideally make a statement to calm the panic and
prevent people from fleeing the capital (potentially carrying the
disease countrywide). This disease only spreads to people who are in
very close contact with sick individuals. Those family members who
are potentially incubating the disease should be encouraged to stay
around Lusaka, so that signs can be picked up quickly and treatment
issued rapidly. Early treatment of most "viral hemorrhagic fevers"
with ribavirin has been proven to reduce the fatality rate
significantly. The country needs to import ribavirin if there is not
enough in stock.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Cantlay for her commentary, which contributes
some interesting detail. At this point, it would not be useful to
speculate further on the identity of the infectious agent responsible
for the deaths of the 4 Zambian patients. No doubt a firm diagnosis
will be available shortly from a South African reference laboratory.
Several different viruses cause viral hemorrhagic fever. Of these,
Ebola, Marburg, Lassa or Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses have
not been recorded in Zambia up to the present. A comprehensive
account of these and other viruses responsible for hemorrhagic fevers
can be found at the US CDC website:
