FAO has launched an emergency animal health campaign across Iraq's Mosul area, which was recently retaken from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). The campaign aims to protect and enhance the assets of 210 000 people who rely on rearing livestock for food and income in the Ninawa Governorate - of which Mosul is the capital. It includes vaccinating almost 1 million sheep, goats, cattle and buffalo and providing 1500 tonnes of high-nutrient feed for 60 000 animals.

The campaign is being implemented in partnership with Iraq's Ministry of Agriculture, with funding from the Iraq Humanitarian Fund.

Ninawa has been profoundly affected by conflict since ISIL took control of central and north-western Iraq in 2014. Many families fled their homes with their livestock, most of which have not been vaccinated since ISIL took over the area.

FAO is concerned that these livestock are likely to carry highly contagious epidemic diseases that can spread rapidly across national and international borders to other herds and people, leading to serious socio-economic and public health consequences.

The FAO-led initiative is the 1st comprehensive animal health campaign in the Mosul area since ISIL's arrival in 2014. Throughout the governorate, the remaining parts of which were retaken from ISIL in August this year [2017], FAO plans to vaccinate the animals against 6 diseases: sheep and goat pox, brucellosis, enterotoxaemia, blackleg disease, lumpy skin disease, and foot-and-mouth disease.

FAO is strengthening the capacity of Ministry of Agriculture staff, FAO's implementing partners, veterinarians and community animal health workers, as well as increasing awareness among livestock owners and community members to protect animals against highly contagious or transmissible diseases that have the potential to rapidly spread, including across borders.

Around 12 million Iraqis reside in rural areas and depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. Cattle, goats and sheep are raised for meat, wool, milk and skin production. After crop production, livestock is the 2nd largest subsector providing agricultural income.

[Ninawa province, situated in north-western Iraq (map at http://tinyurl.com/y8gk85rr), bordering Syria and close to Turkey, is a part of the Kurdish populated territories. This region has long been suffering political instability, accompanied by a complex animal health situation. This was, in fact, one of the last regions suffering rinderpest; it was finally eradicated as late as the mid-90's. - Mod.AS
