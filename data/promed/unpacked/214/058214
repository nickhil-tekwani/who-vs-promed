Apple proliferation phytoplasma found in the Netherlands
The Plant Protection Service of the Netherlands has recently informed the
EPPO Secretariat that ... apple proliferation phytoplasma [was] found in
the Netherlands.
Apple proliferation phytoplasma (EPPO A2 quarantine pest) was found on
apple trees in the provinces of Limburg and Noord-Brabant in autumn 1997.
Infected and neighbouring trees were destroyed. Inspections were regularly
carried out in the concerned fields, and the disease has no longer been
found. It is felt that apple proliferation phytoplasma has been eradicated.
However, inspections will continue during the next season. The source of
this infection is still under investigation.
