Authorities in Phnom Penh reported Mon, 26 Jun 2006, that 30 people suffered
from food poisoning after they ate noodles that were contaminated with
chewing tobacco, which fell out of the mouth of the cook who prepared the
batter.
The 39 year old woman, an employee at a wholesale noodle vendor who supplied
the restaurant where people started vomiting [after eating] the noodles,
said she never knew the wad fell into the ingredients while she talked.
Deputy district police chief Yort Ray said that the incident occurred last
Fri morning, 23 Jun 2006, in a village located in Banteay Meanchey province,
affecting mostly children who were eating noodle soup for breakfast.

[Inadvertent tobacco ingestion usually is related to a child eating all or
part of a cigarette. One report of ingestions of this kind found that
symptoms were reported in 1/3 of the children and included spontaneous
vomiting (up to 4 episodes) (86 per cent of those symptomatic), nausea (7
per cent), pale or flushed appearance (7 per cent), lethargy (3 per cent),
and gagging (3 per cent). All 30 symptomatic children recovered fully within
12 hours (Ref 1).
The following is derived from:
<http://www.prn2.usm.my/mainsite/bulletin/1995/prn2.html>:
Nicotine is one of the most lethal poisons known. At present, virtually all
toxicities involving nicotine are being reported from cigarettes. More than
90 per cent of toxic exposures from cigarettes in the USA are reported in
children less than 5 years of age. A report from Germany reported that most
of the cases are in small children within the 7 month to 2 year old age
range. In Nigeria, an herbal drug containing nicotine increases morbidity
and mortality in this pediatric group. Ingestion of one cigarette (or 3
butts) or drinking saliva expectorated by tobacco chewer (which is often
collected in a can) should be considered potentially toxic for children. In
adults, suicidal ingestion of nicotine-containing pesticides, and
occasionally after cutaneous exposure to nicotine, such as tobacco
harvesters can cause poisoning. Green tobacco sickness (GTS) is an illness
resulting from dermal exposure to dissolved nicotine from wet tobacco
leaves. GTS is characterized by nausea, vomiting, weakness, dizziness, and
sometimes fluctuations in blood pressure or heart rate. More than 95 per
cent of the reported cigarette toxicity is either asymptomatic (70 per cent)
or mild (25 per cent).
Respiratory stimulation and gastrointestinal hyperactivity are 2 main
symptoms of nicotine poisoning. Acute poisoning can even result from skin
contamination or inhalation of tobacco smoke, depending on the doses. Small
doses: respiratory stimulation, nausea and vomiting, dizziness, headache,
diarrhea, tachycardia, elevation of blood pressure, sweating and salivation.
The patient will gradually recover, after a period of weakness.
Large doses: burning sensation of the mouth, throat, stomach, followed
immediately by the above symptoms. Patient may progress to prostration,
convulsions, bradycardia, arrhythmia and finally coma. Death may occur
within 5 minutes to 4 hours.
