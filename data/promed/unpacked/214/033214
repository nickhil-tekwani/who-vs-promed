Mayonnaise from The Langham Hotel [Melbourne, Victoria] kitchens tested positive for the same strain of salmonella that was found in 90 people who ate at the hotel on 11-12 Jul 2015, Victoria's acting chief health officer, Michael Ackland, said.

A total of 16 people were admitted to hospital after falling ill, including a pregnant woman who was forced to deliver her baby 5 weeks early. "Through our investigations we found that the mayonnaise contained the same strain of salmonella found in the confirmed cases," Ackland said. Altogether, 90 people reported falling ill, but it was possible to confirm the infection in only 40 cases.

The Langham Melbourne managing director Ben Sington said the hotel's eggs were sourced from certified suppliers and stored in accordance with guidelines. "Nonetheless, as a precautionary measure while investigations were under way, the hotel took immediate steps ... to only use pasteurized eggs in all cooking processes except for hard-boiled and made-to-order eggs at breakfast, and the hotel ceased making its own mayonnaise," he said.

[Not surprisingly, raw eggs have been found to be the reservoir for this outbreak of salmonellosis. Salmonellosis is often thought to be associated with cracked eggs or eggs dirty with fecal matter, a problem controlled by cleaning procedures implemented in the egg industry. It is clearly the case, however, that most of the salmonellosis outbreaks linked to eggs were associated with uncracked, disinfected Grade A eggs, or foods containing such eggs. The undamaged eggs become contaminated during ovulation, and thus were contaminated with the bacteria before the egg shell was formed. - Mod.LL
