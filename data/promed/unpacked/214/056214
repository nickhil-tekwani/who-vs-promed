[3] USA: Meat plant outbreaks in 18 states
Date: Thu 21 May 2020
Source: Fox 2 Detroit [abridged, edited]
https://www.fox2detroit.com/news/meat-plants-still-covid-hotspots-as-outbreak-ravages-another-tyson-facility


Meat plants are still coronavirus hotspots, even as state lockdown restrictions ease and overall national case numbers begin to fall.

Tyson Foods Inc revealed on Wednesday [20 May 2020] that a quarter of its Wilkesboro, North Carolina, poultry facility tested positive for COVID-19 after facility-wide testing from 6-9 May [2020], according to a press release. Out of 2244 workers at the facility, 570 have tested positive for the virus, the majority of whom were asymptomatic, according to the company.

"We are working closely with local health departments to protect our team members and their families and to help manage the spread of the virus in our communities," Tyson Senior Vice President of Health and Safety Tom Brower said in a statement. "We are using the most up-to-date data and resources to support our team members, and we are committed to ensuring they feel safe and secure when they come to work."

The Wilkesboro plant is one of more than 30 Tyson facilities in the US that have rolled out advanced testing capabilities and on-site care options with Matrix Medical Network, a care management company.

Wilkesboro workers have access to daily screenings and nurse practitioners, and the facility has partnered with healthcare case-management provider Axiom Medical to track employee symptoms and help provide care. All Tyson employees are screened for symptoms before work, are required to wear face masks, and must abide by social distancing guidelines.

The North Carolina plant limited operations on 14 May [2020] so enhanced cleaning procedures could be carried out but has since ramped up production. Workers who test positive for COVID-19 are given paid leave until they meet criteria from Tyson and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to the release.

"Our team members are essential to helping to feed the nation, and their health and safety is always our 1st priority," Kevin Taylor, complex manager for the Wilkesboro facility, said in a statement. "Disclosing our testing results will help better protect our team members and help provide the wider Wilkesboro community with the information it needs to stop the spread of the virus."

The US is facing a meat supply shortage, particularly with pork and beef, due to meat processing plant shutdowns and slowdowns.

President Trump issued an executive order invoking the Defense Production Act on 28 Apr [2020] ordering meat plants to stay open during the pandemic to protect the country's food supply.

At least 15 300 reported COVID-19-positive cases have been connected to meatpacking facilities in at least 192 plants in 32 states as of 20 May [2020] -- up from 14 000 last week -- and at least 63 meatpacking facility workers have died of the virus at 31 plants in 18 states, according to an investigation by the Midwest Center for Investigative reporting.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215. This includes 19 countries (including 4 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 61 countries (including 7 territories) from the European region, 10 countries from the South-East Asia region, 22 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 54 countries (including 19 territories) from the Americas region, and 49 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
------------------------------------------
The Americas region reported 62 221 new cases (56.8% of the global newly reported cases), and 3579 deaths (63.2%) for this 24-hour period. Of the newly confirmed cases in the region, 36.6% were reported by the USA, 29.7% by Brazil, Chile 13.2 %, Peru 7.6 %, and Mexico 4.8%. The Americas region is maintaining its status as having the highest cumulative case count of the 6 WHO regions, with the European region as the 2nd-highest region.

The European region reported 21 413 new cases (19.5% of the global newly reported cases) and 1631 deaths (28.8%). Russia reported 44.0% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, followed by the UK 15.4%, Spain at 8.3%, Turkey 4.4%, Italy 3.0%, Germany and Sweden at 3.0% each.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 13 331 new cases (12.2% of the global newly reported cases) and 158 deaths (2.8%). Saudi Arabia reported 19.8% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Iran 17.3%, Qatar 13.7%, Pakistan 13%, the United Arab Emirates 7.4%, Kuwait 7.2%, and Egypt 5.9%.

The African region reported 2504 new cases (2.3% of the global newly reported cases) and 59 deaths (1.0%). South Africa reported 39.4% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Nigeria at 9.8%, Ghana 8.7%, Algeria 7.6%, Gabon 6.4%, and Cameroon 4.5%.

The Western Pacific region reported 948 new cases (0.86% of the global newly reported cases) and 27 deaths (0.48%). Singapore reported 64.8% of the newly reported cases, followed by the Philippines 17.2%, Malaysia 8.2%, and Japan 2.4%.

The South-East Asia region reported 9119 new cases (8.3% of the global newly reported cases) and 209 deaths (3.7%). India reported 73.0% of newly reported cases, followed by Bangladesh 18.6%, and Indonesia 7.0%. These 3 countries make up 98.5% of all reported cases in the region. Removing India from the denominator, Bangladesh represents 68.7% of the newly reported cases, Indonesia 25.7%, and Nepal 2.5%.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 23 May 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. Europe has significantly decreased. The Americas is increasing, as is South-East Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: It is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Johns Hopkins' CSSE or Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have, at times, significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the Johns Hopkins CSSE or Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4). - Mod.UBA
