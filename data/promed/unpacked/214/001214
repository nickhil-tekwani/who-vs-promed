Later, on the night of [Wed 6 Dec 2017] she arrived in bad condition in the Joaquín Pablo Franco Hospital in Las Tablas where she was attended but later taken to the Anita Moreno Hospital in La Villa, because there was no ventilator in the hospital in Las Tablas.

He stated that the test was positive for [a] hantavirus [infection] making her case number 20 of 2017.

[The situation under which the woman acquired her infection is not mentioned, nor is there an indication if the Ministry of Health or provincial health authorities have, or will, mount an epidemiological investigation in the area where she acquired the infection.

There is no indication of which hantavirus is involved in this or in previous cases in Panama. As noted in comments in previous posts, Los Santos and adjoining provinces are endemic for Choclo hantavirus. Although no data on this or the previous cases in earlier years include an indication of which hantavirus is responsible, Choclo is the only one of the 3 hantaviruses known to be endemic in Panama that causes HPS (hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome) or hantavirus fever. No vaccine is available for Choclo virus.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents occur in and around agricultural areas and adjacent houses and buildings. They can be persistently infected with the virus and shed it in urine, feces and saliva.
