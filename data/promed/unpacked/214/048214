Sauna Linked To Fatal Legionnaire's deaths
Researchers in the Netherlands have traced six cases of Legionnaire's
disease two of them fatal to a sauna. Health records dating back to 1991
revealed that the six cases were related to the same building.
One of the fatalities was a women who had had a kidney transplant and died
10 days after frequenting the sauna. The other fatality was a 59-year-old
man who had no history of immunosuppression. In another case, a
64-year-old man was diagnosed with Legionnaire's disease after regularly
using a footbath in the sauna, Testing revealed that his disease was caused
by the same _Legionella pneumophila_ strain as found in the woman who died.
The man was treated and recovered from acute pneumonia caused by _L.
pneumophila_. Dr J.W. Den Boer of the Municipal Health Service in
Haarlem,the Netherlands, and colleagues at other sites in Haarlem, report
that water from the air-perfused footbath was tested and found to contain
the same strain of _L. pneumophila_. In light of the cases, the sauna
operators changed the hot-water installation of the facility to prevent
water from standing or flowing too slowly. The water also is tested
regularly.
The report describes the first documented cases of lethal sauna associated
Legionnaire's disease, and confirms existing knowledge of long-lasting
spread of _L. pneumophila_ due to a persistent source of infection.
