The illness chikungunya attacked several areas in the City and the
Bogor Regency in the last 2 weeks [weeks of 11 and 18 Nov 2007].
Hundreds of residents were reported to be infected by the illness
that was spread by mosquitoes.

From information that was received by Pikiran Rakyat [newspaper], on
Sunday [25 Nov 2007], dozens of villagers of Loji Kota Bogor have
been infected by the illness [virus] chikungunya. In the Bogor
Regency, the same plague attacked hundreds of residents in 2
subdistricts, namely the Ciampea Subdistrict and Darmaga.

In the Ciampea Subdistrict, chikungunya spread in Bojongrangkas
village, Cihideung Ilir, and Cinangneng, affecting residents there.

In the Darmaga Subdistrict that neighbors the Ciampea area,
approximately 60 people were affected by chikungunya.

Officially, Kesehatan of the Bogor Regency determined that there was
an extraordinary incident [emergency] in the Ciampea territory after
dozens of residents were affected by chikungunya.

The head of the Pencegahan Field of the Eradication of the Illness
and the Health of the Environment (P2PKL), Regional Health Service,
Bogor, Dr. Eulis Wulandari, with the official of the local community
health centre, reported carrying out inspections and mass medical
treatment of the residents.

After having received the report, we at once acted to identify this
illness by checking and taking 10 samples of blood from the
sufferers, [they said].

However, to confirm whether they were affected by chikungunya or not,
we are still awaiting results of the tests on the blood that was sent
by us to Jakarta, he said.

Eulis also said, based on symptoms seen in the sufferers, they were
indeed suspected to be ill with chikungunya. The test results usually
are available in 2 weeks.

So, seeing that the number of sufferers are so many, we determined
that the illness in this area is an extraordinary incident, he said.

Dirty water channels in and around residents' housing fosters
mosquito breeding, said Bambang, who noted a lack of health education
to remind residents of the importance of the health of the
environment.

Bambang also said, anticipating the spread of chikungunya caused by
mosquitoes, that his organization had asked cadres for more
observation and reporting.

At this time, the number of residents infected numbers approximately
60 people, and the possibility is that the number of sufferers could
increase, said Bambang.

In the meantime, 17 sufferers of chikungunya in the area of the Loji
Subdistrict, Kota Bogor, gradually recovered.

[Apparently, this suspected outbreak of chikungunya febrile disease
is expanding in the Bogor area. Until there is laboratory
confirmation of chikungunya virus as the etiological agent
responsible for this outbreak, it must be considered as suspected.
Dengue fever is also occurring on the island of Java currently
(archive no. 20071126.3825), producing similar symptoms. If the dirty
water channels referred to in this report are streams or moving
surface waters, they are not suitable breeding sites for _Aedes_
mosquitoes that transmit chikungunya and dengue viruses, which breed
in still water catchments in and around houses and other buildings.
