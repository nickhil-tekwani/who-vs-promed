A mosquito-borne viral disease similar to dengue fever, which was last
reported in 2009 after its 1st appearance in 2008, has made a strong
comeback in Bangladesh, with 46 people down with the crippling joint
pain fever, a top official of the health directorate has said.

"It seems like a public health threat," Prof Be-Nazir Ahmed, director
of disease control, told reporters on Wednesday [23 Nov 2011]. But the
people "need not be worried, but rather be aware of mosquito bites,"
he said.

The reappearance of chikungunya has triggered concern among officials
and doctors, as the disease, so far treated as mainly a rural scourge,
has been detected in the capital and its suburbs. Experts attributed
environmental factors for the spread of the vector from its origin in
Rajshahi district to Dhaka. "It can attack a large number of people
but usually causes no mortality," Be-Nazir said, adding that the
challenge is in its diagnosis.

"It's very much similar to dengue fever. But treatment is not the
same. If a dengue patient gets chikunguya treatment, the condition
might worsen," he said.

Chikungunya is an alphavirus of the family Togaviridae, carried by the
_Aedes albopictus_ mosquito in Bangladesh.

The name chikungunya derives from a root verb in the East African
Makonde language, meaning "to become contorted" because of severe
joint pains.

The 1st outbreak of the disease was in southern Tanzania in 1952, and
it quickly spread to Asia, including India's rural belt. In 2006, over
752 245 cases were detected in Karnataka and 259 958 in Maharastra.

In Bangladesh, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and
Research detected the 1st outbreak in December 2008 at Poba, Rajshahi,
and Chapai Nawabganj, when some patients showed dengue-like symptoms
but were tested negative. Later, they were detected as chikungunya
[virus infections] after laboratory tests. The 2nd outbreak in 2009
was reported at Sathia in Pabna district.

This year [2011], the institute has traced the disease through its
surveillance in Dohar under Dhaka.

So far, 46 cases -- 31 at Dohar, 12 at Chapai Nawabganj, and 3 in
Dhaka city -- were confirmed from laboratory tests at IEDCR and
Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University.

"We have to be careful about mosquito bites," Be-Nazir said, "and that
the chikungunya [virus vector] mosquito breeds in dirty water, while
_Aedes aegypti_ breeds in clean water. This year's [2011] prolonged
and incessant rains caused small collections of water at different
places and may cause more mosquito breeding," he said.

As this is a new disease for doctors, health directorate guidelines
say dengue fever [causes] lower platelet counts and can trigger
bleeding, while in chikungunya, patients recover from fever and rashes
after a few days. But the crippling pain in joints continues for more
than a month and even for years.

"Fever may subside in the case of chikungunya, but pain in the joints
is severe. Then, patients need to administer drugs to ease the pain,"
Be-Nazir said. "But if they take the same drug in the case of dengue
fever, it might cause bleeding," he said, cautioning "not to take
medication without doctors' advice." He suggested community
participation to wipe out mosquito breeding sites as the only way to
combat mosquito-borne diseases.

The government has started to prepare an action plan to combat the
recurrence of chikungunya, while a vector survey will be launched in
different districts to determine the presence of the mosquito.

Management guidelines have been posted on the IEDCR website for
doctors, according to Be-Nazir.

[Although there have been chikungunya cases before in Bangladesh, this
is the 1st ProMED-mail report. It reports outbreaks in previous years.
There have been outbreaks this month (November 2011) in northeastern
India (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20111117.3390), so it is not
surprising that cases are occurring in Bangladesh.
