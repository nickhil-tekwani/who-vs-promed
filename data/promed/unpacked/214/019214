The number of people sickened by _E. coli_ O157 in Germantown has risen to 55, according to Public Health-Dayton & Montgomery County officials. The health department is investigating the outbreak, which appears to have stemmed from a customer appreciation picnic on 3 Jul 2012 at Neff's Lawn Care.

Bill Wharton, a spokesman for the health department, said 19 additional cases were identified on Wed 11 Jul 2012, with 10 hospitalizations since the event. Wharton did not know the exact status of the hospitalized patients. None of the illnesses were life-threatening. "For our community, this is a fairly large outbreak of E. coli O157," Wharton said.

The health department is not expecting the illness count to rise significantly, because the normal incubation period for this strain of _E. coli_ is 8 days, and Wed 11 Jul 2012 was the 8th day since the picnic. The number has grown over time because those who were feeling ill heard about illnesses from the picnic and contacted the health department, Wharton said.

Bob Neff, owner of the family business that hosts the annual picnic, said he's heartbroken that people became sick from carry-in food eaten at the event. "It's bad when something happens and you have no control," he told News Center 7. He said about 300 people ate food that was mostly prepared off site. He and his sons grilled some meat but do not believe that was the source of the infection because they ate leftovers for several days and did not become ill.

"All of a sudden, your life is turned upside down by one call from the health department," he said.

The picnic has been a growing event since 2007. That's the year that Neff's wife died and friends raised money to help support the family and their new business.

"(The 4th of July party) became a thank-you for friends and family, and then we had customers come," he said. The family has not decided whether they will hold the picnic next year.

[The numbers of affected individuals have continued to increase, but as noted in the posting, the incubation period is expiring. There still may be some more cases as well as household secondary ones possible. No information has yet been reported regarding a potential vehicle. If everyone ate the same thing, it may be hard to narrow the search. - Mod.LL
