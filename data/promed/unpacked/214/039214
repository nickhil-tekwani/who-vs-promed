Influenza update no. 233 [based on data up to 8 Mar 2015]
---------------------------------------------------------

Summary
--------
Globally, influenza activity remained elevated in the northern hemisphere with influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominating, although some countries in Asia, Europe and North Africa reported high levels of activity associated with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses.

- In North America, influenza activity was decreasing but remained above the threshold. Influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominated so far this season.
- In Europe, influenza activity appeared to have peaked in many countries. Influenza A(H3N2) virus continued to be predominant.
- In northern Africa and the Middle East, influenza activity continued to decrease, with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses predominating, except in Egypt, where there was cocirculation with influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B viruses.
- In the temperate countries of eastern Asia, influenza A(H3N2) was predominant, with very little influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus activity, while in western Asia, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B were predominant.
- In tropical countries of the Americas, influenza activity remained low with mainly A(H3N2) viruses detected.
- In tropical Asia, influenza activity patterns varied, with influenza(H1N1)pdm09 predominant in Bhutan and India, influenza A(H3N2) predominant in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and influenza B predominant in south China.
- In the southern hemisphere, influenza activity continued at inter-seasonal levels.

The term "swine flu" has recently been used incorrectly to refer to the seasonal influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus which infects humans during influenza season. The term "swine flu" means influenza viruses that circulate in swine populations (pigs) and infect pigs. A(H1N1)pdm09 is not a "swine flu" virus. Please see the link below for more information on the terminology of influenza viruses in humans
(http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/virology_laboratories_and_vaccines/influenza_virus_infections_humans_feb14.pdf?ua=1).

- Based on FluNet reporting (as of 19 Mar 2015 13:25 UTC), National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 95 countries, areas or territories reported data for the period from 22 Feb 2015 to 7 Mar 2015. The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 111 964 specimens. 27 176 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 17 711 (65.2 percent) were typed as influenza A and 9464 (34.8 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 3383 (33.9 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 6594 (66.1 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 1903 (97.1 percent) belonged to the B Yamagata
lineage and 57 (2.9 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

Countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere
-----------------------------------
North America
In North America, influenza activity remained elevated, but laboratory confirmed influenza detections decreased in most countries. Influenza A(H3N2) viruses continued to dominate and influenza B continued to increase.

In Canada, all influenza indicators remained similar to or decreased from previous weeks except for influenza-like illness (ILI). ILI was above the threshold but exhibited an overall decreasing pattern from the peak around the end of 2014. Influenza B detections increased slightly, particularly in the West, the Prairies and in Quebec mainly affecting the under 64-year-old population. No widespread influenza activity reported.

In the United States of America, influenza activity continued to decline following the peak around the end of 2014. However, there was a slight increase in influenza virus B detections, and the pneumonia and influenza mortality rate reported through the 122 Cities Mortality Reporting System was at 7.6 percent, slightly above the epidemic threshold (7.2 percent) for the week. The influenza detection rate continued to decrease to 11.4 percent positivity from the peak of 30.4 percent positivity at the end of the 2014. ILI outpatient visits (2.4 percent) declined as well, but remained above the 2.0 percent national baseline.

In Mexico, influenza detections decreased to 20.5 percent positivity from the peak of around 50 percent positivity at the end of 2014. Acute respiratory infection (ARI) activity remained high but was within expected levels. Pneumonia activity remained high at 4 pneumonia cases per 100 000 and above expected levels.

Europe
------
In Europe, influenza activity appeared to have peaked in many countries. Influenza activity continued to circulate, and 39 out of 40 countries reported decreased (27) or stable (12) activity. The influenza positivity had been above 50 percent since the end of January 2015 and decreased to 41 percent in the beginning of March 2015. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and B viruses continued to circulate in the region, with slightly increased B virus detections. Influenza A(H3N2) viruses continued to dominate.

Excess all-cause mortality among people aged 65 years or older was observed in Belgium, Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, according to the European project for monitoring excess mortality for public health action (EUROMOMO). This excess all-cause mortality may be associated with circulating influenza, cold weather or increased ARI. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) detections decreased to low levels across the European Region.

In Eastern Europe, ILI decreased in most countries except in Serbia and Turkey. ILI activity seemed to peak and was decreasing in the Czech Republic, the Russian Federation, and Slovakia. While influenza A(H3N2) predominated in Eastern Europe, especially in the Russian Federation, proportions of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B were higher than influenza A(H3N2) in several countries, such as Greece, the Republic of Moldova, Romania, Serbia and Turkey, and were decreasing in the Czech Republic, the Russian Federation, and Slovakia.

North Africa
----------
In northern Africa, influenza activity continued to decrease in Algeria, Egypt and Morocco. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 predominated, but co-circulated with influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B in Egypt.

Western Asia
------------
In western Asia, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B co-circulated with lower influenza A(H3N2) activity. Influenza B was predominant in Georgia, while influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was the main virus detected in Bahrain and Jordan.

Central Asia
----------
In central Asia, some countries reported influenza activity. Kazakhstan and Tajikistan had elevated influenza detection levels, while Uzbekistan reported moderate levels.

Eastern Asia
---------
In eastern Asia, influenza activity decreased overall. While influenza A(H3N2) was still predominant, the proportion of influenza B viruses detected increased slightly over the past few weeks. Influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B co-circulated in the Republic of Korea (with the proportion of influenza B viruses increased), while influenza A(H3N2) was still predominant in Mongolia and Japan, and influenza B was predominant in China. However, in Northern China, both influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B co-circulated. In Japan, influenza activity decreased. A(H3N2) had dominated this year [2015]. ILI activity decreased in China, Mongolia, and the Republic of Korea.

Countries in the tropical zone
--------------------------
Tropical countries of the Americas/Central America and the Caribbean
-----
Overall influenza activity in the Caribbean, Central America and the tropical countries of South America remained low, with influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominating. In Cuba, SARI cases increased slightly, especially in the 1-4-year-old age group, but likely due to respiratory viruses other than influenza. Influenza detections increased slightly in Jamaica, and some influenza B viruses were detected in addition to the influenza A(H3N2) virus detections. SARI activity in Ecuador is stable with infections likely caused by respiratory viruses other than influenza, especially RSV. Influenza activity in Colombia was low but with sustained co-circulation of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B viruses.

Central African tropical region
-------------
In Africa, the influenza activity varied. In western Africa, Senegal reported high influenza detections primarily with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana reported elevated influenza detections primarily with influenza type B. Eastern Africa reported decreased influenza detections with the presence of both influenza A and B.

Tropical Asia
------
In South Asia, influenza activity was high, with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 predominating, especially in Bhutan and India. The case and death counts with confirmed influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 have peaked in India and declined in the beginning of March 2015. In the Islamic Republic of Iran, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, influenza A(H3N2), and influenza B viruses were co-circulating.

ILI activity was decreasing in South China with influenza B viruses more commonly detected than influenza A(H3N2) viruses. In China Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, ILI activity was decreasing but was still high, and influenza A(H3N2) viruses were most common, with a slight increase in influenza B virus detections.

Influenza activity appeared to be low in Cambodia, the Philippines and Viet Nam, while in Lao People's Democratic Republic and Singapore, influenza activity was moderate among people with ILI. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, influenza A(H3N2), and influenza B viruses were co-circulating.

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
--------------------------
Influenza activity remained at inter-seasonal levels in the southern hemisphere countries.

Source of data
----------
The Global Influenza Programme monitors influenza activity worldwide and publishes an update every 2 weeks.

The updates are based on available epidemiological and virological data sources, including FluNet (reported by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System) FluID (epidemiological data reported by national focal points) and influenza reports from WHO Regional Offices and Member States. Completeness can vary among updates due to availability and quality of data available at the time when the update is developed.

[In the northern hemisphere, seasonal influenza is lingering longer than in previous years, but no drastically different antigenic strains have appeared, nor has there been any increase in the number of isolates with enhanced resistance to the neuraminidase inhibiters currently in use. However, the vaccine being produced now to combat the expected seasonal viruses in the northern hemisphere has been amended slightly to take account of minor changes in the current A/H3N2 virus component. - Mod.CP]
