Patient with unidentified hemorrhagic fever now showing improvement
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A 44 year old Senegalese man, suspected to have contracted a viral
hemorrhagic fever, was hospitalized last night [10 Oct 2009] at the
Spallanzani National Institute in Rome. According to institute sources the
clinical picture is consistent with that of a viral hemorrhagic fever.
However, laboratory analysis has excluded Ebola and Marburg hemorrhagic
fevers, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Lassa fever, and Rift Valley
fever. Further analysis is in progress in the high-security laboratories of
the institute. Meanwhile, the condition of the patient is satisfactory and
not considered to be life threatening.

Treatment of the patient and all laboratory procedures have been conducted
under conditions of high biosecurity, first at the hospital Amedeo di
Savoia in Turin and subsequently in the Spallanzani Institute in Rome.

The Spallanzani Institute has stated that the patient is now improving in
terms of clinical tests for blood clotting ability and liver function. The
patient has lived in Italy for 20 years, and returned to Italy on 3 Oct
2009 after a visit to his country of origin. He was admitted initially in
the Amedeo di Savoia hospital in Turin and was later transferred by air
under conditions of high biocontainment arranged by the air force to the
Spallanzani Institute in Rome. Further investigations are in progress
covering a wide spectrum of pathogens. The institute acknowledges extensive
collaboration in case management between the Amedeo di Savoia hospital in
Turin, where the patient was admitted initially, the Sacco hospital in
Milan responsible for land transport of the patient, and the air force in
constant communication with the ministry of health.
