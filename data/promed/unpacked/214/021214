The County of Santa Clara Vector Control District has confirmed the presence of 2 non-native _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes, the 1st time the insects have been detected in the county. The district is carrying out an eradication plan to combat the aggressive mosquito species and urges residents to help protect the community by removing sources of standing water on their properties.

There will be a media availability at 1:30 p.m. on Mon 24 Oct [2022] at the County Government Center at 70 W. Hedding St. in San José.

The invasive mosquitoes were found near the intersection of Dixon Landing Road and McCarthy Boulevard in San José. The district has expanded surveillance efforts for this type of mosquito by deploying a variety of traps for adult mosquitoes. Additionally, the district is employing tactics to eliminate mosquito eggs surrounding the location where the _Aedes aegypti_ were found.

_Aedes aegypti_ (pronounced AY-dees ah-JIP-tie) is not native to California, but it has been detected in 20 counties, including nearby Santa Cruz and Contra Costa counties. It has the potential to transmit several viruses, including dengue, chikungunya, Zika, and yellow fever. Currently, these viruses are not found in California, although the county has had occasional cases of these diseases among returning travelers.

[This is the 1st report of _Aedes aegypti_ in this county but not the 1st in California. _A. aegypti_ mosquitoes continue to increase their geographic range in California. In addition to Santa Clara County, Contra Costa County is also included this year (2022). In 2021, the mosquito was found in 4 other new locations: Butte, Santa Barbara, Ventura, and Yolo counties. Shasta and San Joaquin counties were added earlier, in 2020. The open question is whether these mosquitoes have been established in these localities or eradicated there. Breeding sites can be difficult to find and eliminate.

Although the report above points out that _A. aegypti_ is capable of transmitting any of the mentioned viruses, ongoing transmission is unlikely; however, it is not zero, so elimination of this mosquito as quickly as possible in the localities where it has recently been found is prudent. Once well established, this mosquito is difficult to eradicate. Control requires considerable continuous effort. - Mod.TY
