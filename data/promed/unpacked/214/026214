Joint ECDC-WHO Regional Office for Europe Hepatitis of Unknown Origin in Children Surveillance Bulletin
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Surveillance summary
-------------------
This report provides an overview of the cases of hepatitis of unknown origin in children aged 16 years and below reported to ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe through The European Surveillance System (TESSy) hosted at ECDC. As of [Tue 31 May 2022], 305 cases of acute hepatitis of unknown etiology in children aged 16 years and below have been reported from the European region, of which 305 were classified as probable and none as epidemiologically linked, by 17 countries (Austria (2), Belgium (14), Bulgaria (1), Cyprus (2), Denmark (7), Greece (5), Ireland (8), Italy (29), the Netherlands (14), Norway (5), Poland (3), Portugal (15), Republic of Moldova (1), Serbia (1), Spain (34), Sweden (9), and the UK (155)).

Since the last surveillance bulletin, which used data as of [Fri 20 May 2022], 29 new cases have been reported from 8 countries (Belgium (1), Bulgaria (1), Greece (2), Italy (2), Poland (2), Portugal (4), Spain (6), and the UK (11)).

The epicurve shows cases by the date of onset of first symptoms of disease when available (171 cases), and the date of hospitalisation (127 cases) or date used for statistics when the former are not available (7 cases). A sustained increase in the number of reported cases occurred from week 51 2021, followed by a sharp rise leading to an observed maximum on weeks 12 and 13 2022. As severe hepatitis can take some time to develop after the onset of the 1st symptoms and as investigations take time, there may be a delay in the reporting of cases. The recent decrease in cases is therefore challenging to interpret.

The majority (76.1%) of cases are 5 years old or younger. Of the 305 probable cases, 180 had reported information on outcome. Of these, 148 have recovered, while 31 remain under medical care. Of 169 cases with information, 23 (13.6%) were admitted to an intensive care unit. Of the 131 cases for which this information was available, 14 (10.7%) have received a liver transplant. There has been 1 death associated with this disease.

Overall, 199 cases were tested for adenovirus by any specimen type and had a valid positive or negative result. Of these, 118 (59.3%) tested positive. The positivity rate was the highest in whole blood specimens (68.6%). Typing data were only available for 4 cases: type 40 (n = 1), type 41 (n = 2), and type other (n = 1).

Of the 204 cases PCR tested for SARS-CoV-2, 24 (11.8%) tested positive. Serology results for SARS-CoV-2 were only available for 34 cases, of which 23 (67.6%) had a positive finding. Of the 72 cases with data on COVID-19 vaccination, 61 (84.7%) were unvaccinated.

Introduction
------------
Purpose and scope:
This report provides an overview of the cases of hepatitis of unknown origin in children aged 16 years and below reported to ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe for the period up to [Tue 31 May 2022], through The European Surveillance System (TESSy). Figures and tables describe national case-based data for surveillance of hepatitis of unknown origin in children aged 16 years and below from all the countries and areas of the WHO European Region, including the 27 countries of the European Union (EU) and the additional 3 countries of the European Economic Area (EEA).

Since the first alert launched by the UK on [Tue 5 Apr 2022], cases of hepatitis of unknown etiology in children have been reported from multiple countries worldwide. It is not yet clear whether all cases identified following the alert are part of a true increase compared to the baseline rate of hepatitis of unknown etiology in children.

The etiology and pathogenetic mechanisms of disease are still under investigation. A possible association with current adenovirus infection has been identified, but other hypotheses and possible co-factors are under investigation. Most cases continue to be reported as sporadic, unrelated cases. Data are submitted through the case-based record type NOVHEP to The European Surveillance System (TESSy) database hosted at ECDC.

Case Definition:
Cases of hepatitis of unknown origin should be reported to TESSy if they meet any of the following criteria:

Probable: A person presenting with an acute hepatitis (non-hepatitis viruses A, B, C, D and E*) with aspartate transaminase (AST) or alanine transaminase (ALT) over 500 IU/L, who is 16 years old or younger, since 1 Oct 2021.
Epi-linked: A person presenting with an acute hepatitis (non-hepatitis viruses A, B, C, D and E*) of any age who is a close contact of a probable case since 1 Oct 2021.
Discarded: A subject previously classified as case, that following further investigations did not meet the case definition criteria.
*Cases of hepatitis with known etiology such those due to specific infectious diseases, drug toxicity, metabolic hereditary, or autoimmune disorders should not be reported under this protocol.

Note that the UK local case definition includes only cases younger than 16 years which means cases aged 16 years are not reported to TESSy from the UK.

Persons Under Investigation
---------------------------
Children with Acute Hepatitis of Unknown Etiology:
While rare, children can still have serious hepatitis, and we don't always know the cause. That's why investigators continue to look at possible causes and investigate.

Numbers of persons under investigation (PUI) - 246:
PUI does not mean this person is a confirmed case. The states and CDC are looking broadly (including hepatitis cases of unknown origin in children under 10 years of age, since October, 2021), so this number may go up or down as CDC and states review medical charts and learn more.

States and Jurisdictions Reporting at Least One Person Under Investigation (38)* as of 1 Jun 2022
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*These may not be recent cases of hepatitis being reported.

States or territories with no reported PUI (all others have possible cases but no numbers given) as "To protect patient privacy, numbers for each state will not be released.": Alaska, American Samoa, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Guam, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Montana, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Marianas, Oregon, Palau, South Carolina, Vermont, Virgin Islands, West Virginia, Wyoming.

These data were posted on 1 Jun 2022 and reflect data from 1 Oct 2021. Reported PUIs are preliminary and subject to change as more data become available. Data will be updated weekly.

The number of sudden and mysterious hepatitis cases in children continues to rise. At least 650 cases have been reported worldwide so far, according to the WHO. As of Memorial Day weekend [Sun 29 May 2022], more than 200 of those were reported in the USA.

Wisconsin's Department of Health Services has investigated 7 reported cases here in the state since October 2021. "That we're looking at and doing the follow-up interviews with the family and we're also looking at the extraction of the medical records information," research scientist and epidemiologist Thomas Haupt explained.

Early on in the investigation, the state reported 2 possible cases with severe outcomes. One child died and another needed a liver transplant. However, those cases are not yet directly linked to the mysterious hepatitis illness... so they are not included in the state's current investigation. "The child that died did not die of hepatitis. Unfortunately, he had some other underlying illness underlying conditions that led to his death," Haupt said.

Haupt said current cases are seen throughout the state "including your area, the Brown County and the Northeastern Wisconsin area." A majority of the cases are in kids under the age of 5 -- too young for a COVID vaccine. Haupt said researchers are 100% certain the cases are not vaccine-related.

So what is causing this sudden illness that attacks kids' liver? "Unfortunately, we have more questions than we have answers at this particular point," Haupt said. Common viruses known to cause hepatitis have been ruled out. One theory looks at the adenovirus -- a common stomach virus -- playing a role. Still, that is questionable. Haupt explained, "because in Wisconsin, there's less than half of our cases that have been positive for adenovirus..."

Plus, pediatrician Dr. Donald Beno said not every case of adenovirus is a concern or requires medical attention. "The hardest part of springtime is the season when children have stomach virus. Not every stomach virus is going to cause hepatitis. Very, very few will. If we've only had 7 cases since 2021, we've had hundreds of 1000s of cases of stomach virus," Beno said.

There is another theory that maybe something is triggering an auto-immune response where a child's antibodies are attacking the liver. "All this is still under investigation," Haupt began. "That's why it's so very important that we continue to get the great cooperation from the astute clinicians."

The WHO says it is now aware of 650 cases of hepatitis in children with no known cause across the globe. Some of those cases are in Colorado and could have severe effects on children's livers. The CDC has said it doesn't know what is causing the cases. But over the last 7 months, cases in Colorado are continuing to pop up.

"The doctors just haven't been able to figure out exactly what it is," said Dr. Alexis Burakoff, an epidemiologist with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.

Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver. The mystery illness targeting children has been making its way around the world since at least late last year [2021], and since November [201], there have now been 19 cases found in Colorado, including 15 related hospitalizations. That number though may not represent all of the cases. "There could be kids that aren't very sick that we won't hear about because their liver function tests never get that bad," Dr. Burakoff said.

Colombia reported the 1st case of severe acute hepatitis of unknown origin diagnosed in a 2-year-old patient who has already recovered.

The Ministry of Health and the National Institute of Health of Colombia informed that the child did not have to undergo a liver transplant and that evolution was favorable during the 6 weeks in which the minor presented the clinical picture.

According to a statement from the Ministry of Health and the National Institute of Health (INS), "the patient is a 2-year-old boy, diagnosed with cholestatic hepatitis who presented liver failure, with PCR positive for adenovirus and COVID-19."

Likewise, the entities said that the child evolved satisfactorily and did not require a liver transplant, as occurred in other cases. According to the INS, the minor presented a similar clinical picture to that of other patients in the world, with COVID-19 and adenovirus antecedents. "The minor presented a clinical picture that lasted almost 6 weeks, from the onset of symptoms to its favorable evolution and discharge. The child did not require a liver transplant," the INS and the Ministry of Health said.

According to the latest WHO report as of last Friday [27 May 2022], at least 650 cases of acute childhood hepatitis of unknown origin were confirmed in 33 countries. Nine of the children died and 38 required liver transplants.

Although the disease is not contagious, the Colombian INS has recently called on health professionals to comply with epidemiological surveillance protocols in its diagnosis. Colombia now joins other countries in Latin America where 15 cases have been reported so far, namely Mexico, Panama, and Argentina.

Review of records finds 2 more kids with acute hepatitis last year; infant with the illness in April has recovered
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two retrospective cases of acute hepatitis of unknown causes have been identified. A 3-year-old developed the illness last October [2021], and an 8-year-old got it last November [2021], said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Tuesday [31 May 2022]. After laboratory testing, the 2 cases were found to be negative for the common hepatitis viruses, such as hepatitis type A, B, C and E viruses.

Both children did not have a history of COVID-19 infection prior to their acute hepatitis, and they continue to be under regular follow-up.

The look-back investigation comes after MOH asked all hospitals with pediatric services to review their patient records for those who have similar signs and symptoms as the cases reported by the WHO, which raised the alert on acute hepatitis of unknown cause occurring in young children overseas.

As at [26 May 2022], 650 probable cases have been reported to WHO from 33 countries, with 99 additional cases pending classification, according to the WHO study.

Hepatitis in young children is not uncommon and it is not unusual for the cause of some hepatitis cases in children to remain unknown, said MOH.

"Thus far, MOH has not observed any unusual increase or pattern in the number of children with hepatitis of unknown cause," the ministry said. On [30 Apr 2022], MOH reported a case of acute hepatitis of unknown cause in a 10-month-old infant. The infant has since been discharged and is currently well, said MOH on Tuesday [31 May 2022].

It added that the cause of acute hepatitis remains unknown. MOH added: "While the cause of hepatitis in all 3 cases has not been identified, it may not mean that these cases are linked to the global outbreak. We continue to monitor the situation closely and have informed all medical practitioners to be vigilant for young children presenting with signs and symptoms of hepatitis for which a cause cannot be identified."

[Until a definitive cause is found, it remains to be shown how many of the reported cases are due to the same etiology and how many subclinical or mild cases have occurred. The lack of clusters of cases is not easily explainable but genetic differences in individuals may be playing a role.

An example of this related to SARS-CoV-2 infection is illustrated by:
Zhang Q, Bastard P, Liu Z, et al. Inborn errors of type I IFN immunity in patients with life-threatening COVID-19. Science 2020; 370(6515): eabd4570; https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abd4570.

Abstract
--------
"Clinical outcome upon infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) ranges from silent infection to lethal coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We have found enrichment in rare variants predicted to be loss-of-function (LOF) at the 13 human loci known to govern Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)- and interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7)-dependent type I interferon (IFN) immunity to influenza virus in 659 patients with life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia relative to 534 subjects with asymptomatic or benign infection. By testing these and other rare variants at these 13 loci, we experimentally defined LOF variants underlying autosomal-recessive or autosomal-dominant deficiencies in 23 patients (3.5%) 17 to 77 years of age. We show that human fibroblasts with mutations affecting this circuit are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. Inborn errors of TLR3- and IRF7-dependent type I IFN immunity can underlie life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia in patients with no prior severe infection."

Dr. Casanova, the senior author on this paper has published many papers showing that subtle genetic changes can be associated with more severe disease due to a variety of pathogens. - Mod.LL]
