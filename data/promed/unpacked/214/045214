A quarantine imposed in Russia's Far East regions to combat foot and mouth
is been lifted, Viktor Volkov, chief veterinary of the Primorsky region
said in a statement issued Thursday.
The quarantine, imposed in August, was lifted Wednesday [28 Sep 2005] in
the village of Pavlo-Fedorovka in the Primorsky region, as no new cases had
been registered there in 21 days. The quarantine will be lifted completely
in the region by 10 Oct 2005.
The statement said all the cattle in the region had been vaccinated twice
against the disease.
Altogether 1715 cattle were slaughtered in the Primorsky region since the
1st cases were reported in August 2005.
