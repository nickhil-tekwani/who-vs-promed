Nearly 450 people were hospitalized in Armenia in June, July, and the 1st week of August [2014] with suspected acute meningitis, a disease caused by enterovirus infections, Gayane Sahakyan, the head of the National Immunization Program of the Health Ministry, told a news conference today [7 Aug 2014]. "Fortunately, the diagnosis of acute meningitis was confirmed only in less than 1/3 of cases. The number of people seeking [the] assistance of hospitals is gradually decreasing. There is no epidemic," she said.

Sahakyan noted that diseases caused by enteroviruses are dangerous and have a variety of symptoms. They are transmitted through air and tactile contacts with sick people or contaminated objects. The point is that a healthy person could be a carrier of the disease for 5-6 months, and thus become a source of infection to others.

"The danger is that the symptoms of enteroviral diseases can manifest themselves in many different ways, such as acute respiratory infections and diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. For an accurate diagnosis a special laboratory study is required," Sahakyan said.

"To protect against enterovirus diseases people must comply with the most basic rules of personal hygiene, wash hands, fruits, and vegetables thoroughly, disinfect homes and premises, not to swim in open water reservoirs not intended for swimming," she said.

She said preventive measures are being implemented in kindergartens and children's summer camps at the order of the health minister in order to prevent outbreaks of enterovirus infections.

Enterovirus infection is a group of acute infectious diseases caused by enteric viruses (enteroviruses), characterized by fever and [a variety] of clinical symptoms involving people's central nervous system, cardiovascular system, gastrointestinal tract, muscle, lung, liver, kidney, and other body organs.

[ProMED-mail posted a report of an outbreak of serous acute meningitis presumed to be due to enteroviruses in Armenia in May-June 2014, with a total of 38 cases recorded, mainly in the 3- to 8-year-old age group (Enteroviral meningitis - Armenia 20140628.2572211). The news report above says the diagnosis of viral meningitis has now been confirmed in "less than 1/3" of the total of 450 cases hospitalized with suspected acute viral meningitis and the number of hospitalized cases has been decreasing. The news report does not say if the enteroviral etiology has been confirmed in any of these cases.

The term "meningitis" means an inflammation of the meninges, which are the tissues that surround the brain and spinal cord. "Serous" meningitis is a term used when clinical findings (such as a stiff neck) suggest meningitis, but the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), although under increased pressure, is clear to the naked eye (http://www.bmj.com/content/2/3691/627.3).

Normally, there are 0 to 5 white cells (all mononuclear cells) per cmm [per cubic millimeter] in the CSF. CSF becomes cloudy when there are more than 500 white cells per cmm. When the CSF is visibly clear, but on laboratory examination the CSF white cell count is 6 to 500 cells per cmm, usually with lymphocytes predominating, the term aseptic meningitis is used.

The most common cause of aseptic meningitis is a viral infection and enteroviruses are common causes of viral meningitis, especially in children during the summer months. However, aseptic meningitis may be caused by other viruses, such as arboviruses, HIV, herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2, some bacteria, fungi, and parasites. Non-infectious causes include certain drugs, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and systemic diseases, such as lupus, sarcoidosis, and metastatic cancer.

Most people who get infected with enteroviruses are asymptomatic or have only a non-specific febrile illness. Enteroviruses are most often spread via the fecal-oral route from person to person through fecal contamination of water or food or contact with contaminated inanimate objects. Enteroviruses can also be spread through respiratory secretions (saliva, sputum, or nasal mucus) of an infected person. - Mod.ML
