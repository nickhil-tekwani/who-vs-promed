pending) & south to southern Maryland, USA, surpassing its 1999 limits.
(The fact that the ProMED-mail Policy Committee met this week in Toronto is
entirely coincidental.) Cold nights -- less than 60 degrees F -- have

The first possible sign of the deadly West Nile virus in Canada has been
found in a crow in Windsor, indicating the virus may be heading here.
A small amount of genetic material from a virus consistent with West Nile
was detected in a dead crow found 10 Aug 2000, scientists at the federal
government's highly sophisticated laboratory in Winnipeg have confirmed.
Tissue samples from the carcass were sent Wednesday to an American
laboratory experienced in identifying West Nile to try to confirm the
results. The results are expected in a week.
"We want to get a conclusive answer as soon as possible," said Dr. Harvey
Artsob, chief of zoonotic diseases at the Canadian Science Centre for Human
and Animal Health, one of only 12 labs in the world that can handle the
deadliest infections known.
It is a "possible positive," Dr. Allen Heimann, medical officer of health
for Windsor and Essex County, said Wednesday. But Heimann emphasized that
the finding does not mean there is an immediate threat to public health.
More than 600 dead birds across Ontario have been tested since the crow was
found and none have shown signs of the virus. No trace of the virus has been
found in humans, mosquitoes or sentinel chickens during continued monitoring.
The find has surprised and stumped some health officials who have been
monitoring for the virus. They expected it to appear first in the Niagara
Region because of that area's proximity to New York State. However,
surveillance of the virus across New York State shows that it has
"hopscotched" hundreds of km in relatively short periods, said Barker.
It could be that the mosquitoes are being blown by the wind, that infected
birds are migrating or simply that surveillance is inconsistent, he said.
Ontario does only one-fifth the surveillance now being done in New York
State.

Tests on the bird at a federal laboratory in Winnipeg showed signs of the
virus, but were inconclusive, said Dr. Harvey Artsob, head of Health
Canada's zoonotic diseases. He said tissue has been sent to a lab in the
United States that is experienced in testing for the virus. The results are
expected in about 10 days.
More than 1100 tests have been performed on dead birds across Ontario since
May and this is the only possible case of the virus, said Dr. Colin D'Cunha,
Ontario's chief medical officer of health.

West Nile Virus, avian cases - Maryland
-----------------------------------
Late Tuesday night, CDC Fort Collins confirmed the presence of West Nile
virus in a crow found in Relay, Maryland near the Baltimore County / Howard
County line. Originally discovered 13 Sep 2000, the bird was obviously quite
ill (unable to stand or perch) and transported to an animal refuge center
where it later died and was submitted to the Department of Health and Mental
Hygiene's Laboratory Administration. Preliminary necropsy findings were
consistent with intercranial lesions notably associated with WNV. Two test
sets of RT-PCR were completed and found to be positive. The specimen was
then forwarded for confirmatory testing to Ft. Collins.
An additional crow, found in Howard County, not far from the index case
has also tested positive and has been sent to CDC for confirmatory testing.
Maryland Department of Agriculture will commence ground spraying the
evening of Fri 22 Sep 2000.
Last year a WNV positive crow was found in Baltimore City. However the
findings contained in this report mark the first evidence of WNV in Maryland
this year.

The mosquito-borne West Nile virus has extended its U.S. range southward
into heavily populated Maryland suburbs, where 2 infected crows were found
dead last week, health officials said on Thursday.
One bird was discovered 15 Sep 2000 in Columbia, about 30 miles (48 km)
northwest of Washington, D.C., while a second turned up two days earlier in
the nearby community of Relay, which lies further north toward Baltimore.
Until now, West Nile virus had not been seen further south than the city of
Baltimore, where an infected crow was discovered last October 1999. The
latest discoveries were the first in Maryland for 2000.

New Jersey
Test Results as of 21 Sep 2000 [edited
<http://www.state.nj.us/health/cd/westnile/enceph.htm>

Human Testing
In total, blood and/or spinal fluid samples from 34 residents have been or
are in the process of being tested for the presence of WNV. To date, 2 tests
were positive*, 12 were negative and 20 are pending. These individuals
either had symptoms or signs that met the established WNV testing criteria
or exhibited most of the symptoms and are from counties where dead crows
and/or mosquitoes with the virus have been discovered.
New Jersey's positive human cases include a 43-year old Jersey City man
whose test was verified by the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) on 1 Sep 2000.
*In addition, a 54-year old man with dual residency in Brooklyn, N.Y., and
Cliffside Park, Bergen County, N.J., tested positive for WNV. The 54-year
old man became ill 31 Aug 2000 and was admitted to a New York City hospital
on Sept. 4. His WNV test was conducted by the New York City Health
Department and verified by the CDC on 12 Sep 2000.
Human testing for WNV is being conducted at the New Jersey Department of
Health and Senior Services' Public Health and Environmental Laboratory in
Trenton and at public health labs in other states. Testing results are sent
to the CDC for verification.
Bird Testing
To date, 838 birds (837 crows and a cockatiel) found in 16 counties have
tested positive for the presence of WNV. A total of 1527 crows have been
accepted for testing this year.
The CDC has analyzed blood samples taken from 541 house sparrows collected
in Bergen, Passaic and Sussex County in late July. No sparrows with WNV were
discovered in New Jersey.
Mosquito Testing
Twelve mosquito pools have tested positive for the presence of WNV. In
total, 1678 mosquito pools from all 21 counties have been collected by the
Rutgers Mosquito Research and Control Unit and tested by the Department of
Health and Senior Services and/or the CDC.
Sentinel Chicken Testing
Blood samples taken weekly from sentinel chicken flocks placed in all 21
counties and tested by the New Jersey Department of Agriculture have all
tested negative for the presence of WNV to date.
Horse Testing
Three horses from Atlantic, Cape May and Ocean Counties have tested positive
for WNV. The tests were conducted by the New Jersey Department of
Agriculture's animal health laboratory in Trenton and were confirmed by the
National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa.

West Nile Virus Update; 25 Birds, 8 Mosquito Pools, and 1 Rabbit Test
Positive for West Nile Virus (22 Sep 2000) [edited
<http://www.ci.nyc.ny.us/html/doh/html/wnv/wnvhome.html>

New York City Health Commissioner Neal L. Cohen, M.D., announced today that
evidence of West Nile virus (WNV) has been confirmed by the New York State
Department of Health in 25 birds, 8 mosquito pools, and one [domestic
rabbit in New York City. Weather permitting, ground spraying is scheduled
for Central Park on Saturday morning [midnight  0500 hrs; & areas of
Queens & Brooklyn, weather permitting. Temperatures of 60F or lower may
necessitate postponement of spraying activities. [And restrict mosquito
activity.  Mod.JW
Dr. Cohen said, "Despite today's announcement of the presence of virus in 34
additional specimens, we will only need to initiate new control activities
in 4 areas because our surveillance activities previously gave us sufficient
warning to have targeted those remaining areas in a timely manner."
Bird, Mammal & Mosquito Findings
The positive WNV findings announced today include:
In Queens, 4 birds (starling, house sparrow & 2 crows) collected between 2
Aug & 11 Sep 2000.
In Brooklyn, 9 birds, (robin, 8 crows) collected between 25 Aug & 9 Sep 2000.
In Manhattan, 4 crows: one from Harlem collected 8 Sep 2000, one from
Central Park collected 8 Sep 2000, & 2 from the Upper West Side collected 10
Sep 2000, and one mosquito pool collected in Central Park on 9 Sep 2000.
In the Bronx, one sparrow, collected in Port Morris 31 Jul 2000.
On Staten Island, 7 birds (6 crows & a grackle) collected between 7 & 12 Sep
2000, 5 mosquito pools one collected from 6-12 Sep 2000, & one [domestic
rabbit collected on 28 Aug 2000.

West Nile Virus Update - Posted: 22 Sep 2000 [edited

Today, the New York State Health Department's Wadsworth Center laboratories
reported 24 West Nile virus positive dead birds [from a long list of
counties.
Twelve West Nile Virus positive mosquito pools were reported in New York
City: Brooklyn, 3; Manhattan, 1 and Staten Island, 8.
One West Nile Virus positive live wild bird was found in Queens, and 1 West
Nile virus positive domestic rabbit was found in Albany County.
The total number of West Nile virus positive specimens from New York State
for this year is 839 birds, 286 mosquito pools, 1 sentinel chicken, 7 live
wild birds, 14 bats, 1 horse, 1 raccoon, 3 domestic rabbits, 1 chipmunk and
11 human cases.
[A check on the NYS map, updated to 22 Sep 2000,
<http://www.health.state.ny.us/nysdoh/westnile/update/today.gif>
shows only 2 counties (Wayne & Chenango) in the entire state with no
evidence yet of WNV activity. Plus, the map has a list showing the virus
has even killed a macaw & a hummingbird, & is having an impact on dozens of
American bird species, including the House Sparrow & European Starling (16 &
4 cases, respectively) which were at first thought to be circulating virus
without ill effects  Mod.JW.

Westchester County today postponed ground spraying plans for tonight,
Thursday, September 21, in the communities of Ardsley, Dobbs Ferry, Mt.
Pleasant, Mt. Vernon, Pleasantville, Sleepy Hollow and Tarrytown due to
anticipated cold weather.
[This is good news. If cold weather is beginning to restrict mosquito
activity in downstate New York, the days of the epidemic are numbered. 

Pennsylvania's West Nile Virus Surveillance Program
http://www.westnile.state.pa.us/StateSummary/
WEEKLY REPORT - SEPTEMBER 11, 2000 [edited

This report summarizes Pennsylvania's Mosquito Surveillance Program from 1-7
Sep 2000.
To date West Nile virus (WNV) has not been found in Pennsylvania.
Pennsylvania's Mosquito Surveillance Program began on April 3. Currently, 37
counties have active surveillance programs, with 3660 surveillance sites. 47
counties are currently in routine surveillance, and 20 counties are
currently in enhanced surveillance.
Mosquito Sampling To Date
Samples Collected 6726
Samples Contain Mosquitoes
Appropriate for Testing 842
Negative results for WNV 375
Samples with Results Pending 467

Bird Sampling To Date
Bird Samples Collected 372
Birds Tested for WNV 349
Negative results for WNV 137
Birds with Results Pending 212
[It is quite striking that although counties all over Pennsylvania have
submitted bird samples for testing, there have so far (as of 7 Sep 2000, the
latest available information) been no positives, considering that all the NY
state counties bordering on Pennsylvania have produced positives  see map
<http://nationalatlas.gov/virusmap/w36/wnavi36c.gif>
The same applies to Vermont & New Hampshire (the latter bordering on
positive counties in Massachusetts). The enzootic (outbreak in birds) seems
to be spreading quite slowly  apart from the jump to southern Maryland. 

The Department of Environmental Management this evening announced the second
finding of West Nile Virus in Westerly. The positive result came from an
American Crow that was collected from Wilcox Park in downtown Westerly on 10
Sep 2000. The bird was tested at the University of Rhode Islands Mosquito
Virus Testing Laboratory. Confirmatory test results were received by DEM at
5:30 p.m. this evening.
DEM also notified Connecticut state officials of the positive finding, since
the birds location was close to the Stonington, CT town line.
Under the states mosquito action plan, testing birds and mosquitoes for
signs of the disease has been ongoing since late May 2000. No mosquitoes
have tested positive for West Nile Virus or Eastern Equine Encephalitis
(EEE). To date, 124 birds have tested negative for either disease; 7
previously tested positive for West Nile Virus, including an American Crow
that was collected on Sherwood Drive in Westerly on 17 Aug 2000; and 2
previously tested positive for EEE. In addition, the presence of West Nile
Virus was previously reported in a horse, which was euthanized.
