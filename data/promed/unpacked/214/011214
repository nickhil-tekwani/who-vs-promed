These are interesting data and very much akin to the ecology of
_Legionella_ species. Has care been taken to assure that the antibody
specificity for _H. pylori_ has been confirmed to exclude _Legionella_ species
cross-reactivity? In a fashion similar to _Legionella_, _H. pylori_ might
then be detected in potable water samples under other conditions.
