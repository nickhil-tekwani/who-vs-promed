Between 28 Mar 2005 and 19 Feb 2006, 2406 cases of chikungunya have been
notified by the 31 physicians from a sentinel network on Reunion, including
333 cases reported during the week 13 to 19 Feb 2006.
Estimations from a mathematical model evaluate that 157 000 people may have
been infected by chikungunya virus since March 2005 on Reunion, including 22
000 persons during the week 13 to 19 February.
Since the beginning of January 2006, other countries in the southwest Indian
Ocean have reported chikungunya cases: Mayotte (924 cases) Mauritius (2553
cases including 1173 lab-confirmed cases) and the Seychelles (4650 cases).
A WHO team from the Regional Office for Africa and headquarters has been
deployed in the zone to assess the control measures under way in the different
islands. The main preventive measure is to stop the proliferation of
mosquitoes by reducing their breeding grounds. These include anti-vectoral
activities and the destruction of domestic breeding sites, coupled with an
extensive public health education campaign using mass media and community
associations to sensitize the population about protective measures.
Epidemiological surveillance and vectoral surveillance are also being
reinforced. The team has begun discussions on a sub-regional strategy for
surveillance and control of chikungunya and other arboviruses with national
authorities.

A disabling mosquito-borne disease that has hit the French Indian Ocean island
of Reunion has claimed 93 lives, and almost a quarter of the population has
been affected, Health Minister Xavier Bertrand revealed. The toll of 93 [case
fatality rate of 50 per 100 000] amounted to people whose death was directly
or indirectly attributable to the disease, known as chikungunya, he said in a
visit to the prestigious Pasteur Institute in Paris.
A total of 186 000 people [incidence rate of 24 percent] have fallen sick with
the disease in the course of the epidemic, he said. Reunion has a population
of 777 000.
France has committed emergency health and economic aid worth 91 million Euros
(USD 109 million) to Reunion to help it fight the scourge. Reunion is an
ethnically diverse department of France which lies to the east of Madagascar.
Cases have also been recorded in the nearby French island of Mayotte, as well
as in the Indian Ocean islands of Madagascar, Mauritius and the Seychelles,
and among a small number of [Reunionnese] arriving in mainland France.
"I am paying particular attention to Mayotte (where) the threshold of 2000
cases has been crossed," Bertrand said. "I want to be sure that we are getting
a true picture, and especially that all people who show up at clinics (with
chikungunya) are properly recorded" as having the disease, he said.
The French government has been under intensifying criticism for failing to
react in time as the epidemic started to unfold in early 2005. Chikungunya, a
disease believed to have originated in Africa, derives from a Swahili word
meaning "that which bends up" because of its arthritic-type symptoms that
leave victims stooped.
The disease is generally non-fatal and patients eventually recover, although
much about it remains unclear.
Some 500 French troops have already been deployed in Reunion to help health
workers spray mosquito breeding areas.
The vector for chikungunya is _Aedes albopictus_, the Asian tiger mosquito,
which also transmits dengue fever. The insect has spread far beyond its
Southeast Asian home by hitch-hiking in trade shipments, experts say.
15 cases of co-infection, in which patients were struck by both chikungunya
and dengue, have so far been reported, Bertrand said. The crisis has badly
affected Reunion's main industries of tourism and agriculture. Foreign
visitors are cancelling vacations, and local farmers are facing a slump in
demand for their fruit and vegetables because of worries about toxic
insecticides.
On Thursday, the French airline Air France said that reservations for flights
between France and Reunion over the next 3 months had plummeted by 15 percent
below normal levels.
Of the 91 million Euros earmarked for help, 60 million will be spent in the
form of economic aid. 9 million will be spent on basic research into the
disease.
