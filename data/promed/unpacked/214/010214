Verburg obtains support for bluetongue vaccination
--------------------------------------------------
Minister Gerda Verburg (Agriculture) has obtained the support of Belgium,
Germany, and France to raise bluetongue vaccination as subject for EU
discussions in Brussels on 26 Sep 2007. The vaccine must be ready before
Christmas, [so that] veterinarians will be able to carry out preventive
vaccination in spring [2008].
"The support of these other countries will secure a bigger market for the
vaccine and a better chance for permission [for vaccination] in the EU,"
the minister said today [17 Sep 2007) during an informal EU meeting in
Porto. "Bluetongue is a big problem," said Verburg. "Last year it affected
only Limburg and Brabant. This year the virus has rapidly spread throughout
the entire country: there are already more than 1400 cases."
The animal disease affects mainly sheep, with an undefined mortality rate.
"There are many stories about high mortality rates, but no clear, accurate
figures so far. We are currently compiling them." The costs of vaccination
will, in principle, be covered by the farmers. Verburg [said]: "If you keep
animals, you must take care of them. But if the sector decides to establish
a mutual insurance, I shall support them."
The Belgian minister Laruelle (Agriculture) is already willing to provide
the government's partial financial coverage of the vaccination costs. She
also wishes to raise in Brussels the issue of previous bluetongue losses.
Farmers have lost a lot of money due to the death of many sheep.
Belgium has been hit by bluetongue the hardest, compared with the other
affected countries. "A marked vaccine ["DIVA" vaccine] may be helpful in
reviving our export. They would, for example, be allowed entrance to
North-Italy, for fattening. The current ban costs a lot of money."

[According to information derived from German and Swiss sources and kindly
forwarded by Sabine Zentis, BTV-8 spread, which has recently been recorded
in Germany, is affecting also neighbouring countries as follows:
1. Bluetongue has been confirmed in a bovine in Schleswig-Holstein
(northern Germany). The 20 km (12.4 mile) surveillance zones have been
extended accordingly, similarly to the 150 km (93 mile) restriction zones.
The latter are now covering part of Denmark in the provinces of Jutland,
Funen, and Lolland.
2. Due to confirmation of bluetongue in Baden-Wurttemberg (southern
Germany), less than 100 km (62 miles) from the border with Switzerland, a
restriction zone has been declared covering the Swiss canton of
Schaffhausen. As from Wednesday [19 Sep 2007], ruminants destined for other
parts of Switzerland have to be bloodtested with a negative result prior to
transport. See
