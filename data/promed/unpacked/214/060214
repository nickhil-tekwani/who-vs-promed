Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 26 Jun 2013
Report date: 6 Dec 2013
Date submitted to OIE: 6 Dec 2013
Date event resolved: 6 Sep 2013
Reason for notification: emerging disease
Morbidity: 40 percent
Mortality: 40 percent
Zoonotic impact: no
Causal agent: _Mikrocytos mimicus_ n. sp.

New outbreaks (3)
Outbreak 1 (26 118): Brancaster, North Norfolk, England
Date of start of the outbreak: 17 May 2013
Outbreak status: resolved (6 Sep 2013)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Water type: salt water
Population type: farmed
Production system: semi-open
Affected animals:
Species / Morbidity / Mortality / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Pacific oyster (_Crassostrea gigas_) (kg) / 40 percent / 40 percent / 5000 / 2000 / 2000 / 0 / 0
Affected population: farmed population of triploid _C. gigas_, grown in bags on trestle. Adult, market-sized oysters were most affected, with losses in some bags reaching 80 percent. The infection was not seen in all adult stock on the farm, and some batches remained unaffected. There was a lower observed incidence in juvenile oysters on the site estimated at 20 percent morbidity and mortality.

Outbreak 2 (26 426): Thornham, North Norfolk, England
Date of start of the outbreak: 22 May 2013
Outbreak status: resolved (6 Sep 2013)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Water type: salt water
Population type: farmed
Production system: semi-open
Affected animals:
Species / Morbidity / Mortality / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Pacific oyster (_C. gigas_) (kg) / 20 percent / 20 percent / 250 / 50 / 50 / 0 / 0
Affected population: the infection was seen in a small isolated farmed population of triploid _C. gigas_ grown in bags on a suspended system. Adult, market-sized oysters were most affected, although some oysters remained unaffected. Around 20 percent of the oysters harvested from this small farm were affected and were rejected by the farmer at harvest.

Outbreak 3 (26 119): Blakeney Harbour, North Norfolk, England
Date of start of the outbreak: 12 Jun 2013
Outbreak status: resolved (6 Sep 2013)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Water type: salt water
Population type: farmed
Production system: semi-open
Affected animals:
Species / Morbidity / Mortality / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Pacific oyster (_C. gigas_) (kg) / 20 percent / 20 percent / 250 / 50 / 50 / 0 / 0
Affected population: the infection was seen in a small and isolated farmed population of triploid _C. gigas_ grown on trestles. Adult, market-sized oysters were most affected, although the infection was not seen in all adult stock on the farm, and some batches remained unaffected. Very few oysters were present on this site, which had been fallow for at least a year; the event affected 20 percent of the stock; none was harvested during the mortality event.

Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 3
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Pacific oyster (_C. gigas_) (kg) / 5500 / 2100 / 2100 / 0 / 0
Outbreak statistics:
Species / Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate / Apparent case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Pacific Oyster (_C. gigas_) (kg) / 38.18 percent / 38.18 percent / 100 percent / 38.18 percent
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: movement controls in the form of an initial designation were applied to the individual farm sites, which prevented the onward movement of live oysters for farming or relay. Under the conditions of the designation, movements of _Crassostrea gigas_ were permitted for direct human consumption, subject to hygiene regulations. In addition, the controls stipulated that disposal of dead Pacific oysters (_C. gigas_) of all stages must be by an approved method for disposal of Category 2 animal by-product waste. The epidemiological investigation has been completed; the designations have been lifted, and the incident has been closed. The mortalities occurred from late May 2013 and ceased in late July 2013. On 21 Aug 2013, the oysters were sampled by the Fish Health Inspectorate and showed no evidence of _Mikrocytos mimicus_ or the presence of any listed diseases.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; tracing forward; tracing back; official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste; surveillance within containment and/or buffer zone; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied: surveillance outside containment and/or buffer zone

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS) (national laboratory) / Pacific oyster (_Crassostrea gigas_) / histological test / 5 Jun 2013 / Positive
Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS) (national laboratory) / Pacific oyster (_C. gigas_) / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 26 Jun 2013 / Positive
Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS) (national laboratory) / Pacific oyster (_C. gigas_) / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 6 Sep 2013 / Negative

Future Reporting
The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

[Please note that the available information is about _Mikrocytos mackini_. According to the OIE's Aquatic Manual, infection of oysters with _Mikrocytos_ is considered to be with _M. mackini_, the causative agent of Denman Island disease.

_M. mackini_ is a protozoan of unknown taxonomic affiliations. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that _M. mackini_ may be a basal eukaryote, but almost certainly is not closely related to other known protistan taxa.

Pacific oyster (_Crassostrea gigas_), eastern oyster (_C. virginica_), European flat oyster (_Ostrea edulis_), and Olympia oyster (_O. lurida_) are oyster species susceptible to infection.

All life stages of oysters after settlement are susceptible to infection. The susceptibility of larvae is not known. Infection can be fatal depending on host and environmental conditions.

Cool temperatures of less than 10 deg C (50 deg F) for 3-4 months seem to be a requirement for disease development. Experimentally exposed oysters held at 15 deg C (59 deg F) for 3 months did not develop the disease until they were transferred and maintained at 10 deg C for an additional 4 months. The annual appearance of the disease only during the spring (March to June) could be explained by the cool temperature requirements for disease development.

Management techniques can be employed by the aquaculture industry to circumvent the impact of _M. mackini_.

For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to Chapter 2.4.8 of the OIE Aquatic Manual, Infection with _M. mackini_. This disease is no longer an OIE listed disease. http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/aahm/current/2.4.08_M_MACKINI.pdf.

Clinical signs of infection include dead and gaping oysters found in the spring. Gross examination may reveal focal lesions predominately of the vesicular connective tissue. These lesions may develop into pustules, abscesses, and ulcerations in the area of the mantle often with corresponding brown scars on the shell. These sings are similar to those of many other diseases affecting shellfish and are, therefore, not pathognomonic of _M. mackini_ (http://www.defra.gov.uk/aahm/files/Guide-Mikrocytosis.pdf).

_M. mackini_ has not been found in oysters in the UK. (http://www.defra.gov.uk/aahm/files/Guide-Mikrocytosis.pdf).

The causal agent for this particular event was identified as _Mikrocytos mimicus_ a new species of the pathogen of an unlisted disease, hence the reason for it being notified as an emerging disease. Given that it is identified as an emerging disease, the OIE recommends that it be reported to alert and make Member countries aware of the event.

The affected species was the Pacific oyster (_Crassostrea gigas_), impacting primarily adult, market-sized oysters.

For background on the Pacific oyster (_C. gigas_) and its importance in the United Kingdom, see commentaries in ProMED-mail postings 20131030.2030679 and 20131107.2043842.

Pacific oyster (_C. gigas_) photos can be seen at http://eol.org/pages/451579/overview.

The fact that outbreaks of oyster herpesvirus (see ProMED-mail archive number 20131107.2043842) and now _Mikrocytos mimicus_ have been reported recently may be an indication of UK's increased surveillance for diseases in molluscs. - Mod.CRD
