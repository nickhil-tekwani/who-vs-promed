No fewer than 10 children with leukaemia have died while 9 are in critical condition after receiving smuggled medicines in a public Kuwait hospital in Sanaa, Yemen's capital. A statement by the Houthi-controlled health authorities disclosed this on Friday [14 Oct 2022], adding that authorities will commence an investigation into the tragic incident.

AFP reports that smuggled medicines are common for hospitals across war-torn Yemen, which have been suffering from a shortage of drugs, equipment and funds as more than half of Yemen's medical facilities have been paralysed since the civil war broke out.

"Ten children suffering from leukaemia have died at Kuwait hospital," the Houthi rebels' health ministry said, adding they were among a group of 19 patients aged between 3 and 15 with the illness.

It said "bacterial contamination" had been discovered in the injections administered to the children, adding that the medication had been smuggled into the country.

Another child was in "highly critical condition," it said.

The Houthi rebels captured large parts of northern Yemen in 2014 and drove the Saudi-backed Yemeni government out of Sanaa, plunging the Arab country into a civil war that continues till date. The war has led to the death of tens of thousands of people, displaced 4 million, and pushed the Arab country to the edge of starvation.

At least 10 child leukemia patients in Yemen have died, and dozens more left seriously ill, after being administered expired doses of a cancer treatment in the rebel-held capital [Sana'a], medical officials and workers said on Friday [14 Oct 2022].

Yemen's ruinous conflict, now entering its 8th year, has caused one of the world's worst humanitarian crises and killed in excess of 150 000 people.

The children were aged between 3 and 15 [years] and died at Sanaa's Kuwait Hospital after being injected with old doses of smuggled medicine at a number of private clinics, the rebel-run Health Ministry said in a statement Thursday [13 Oct 2022]. The officials did not say when the 10 deaths occurred.

According to a half dozen health officials and workers who spoke to The Associated Press, some 50 children received a smuggled chemotherapy treatment known as methotrexate that was originally manufactured in India. They said a total of 19 children had died from the expired treatment. The officials and workers spoke on condition of anonymity, as they were not briefed to speak with the media.

Amid Yemen's war, the lack of access to basic resources, including food and medicine, has created large smuggling networks across both rebel-held Houthi and Saudi coalition-run areas. Several doctors in Sanaa said that Houthi officials secretly work in partnership with medicine smugglers who sell often expired treatment to private clinics from storage houses across the country. In doing so, they said the Houthis were limiting the availability of safe treatments.

The Houthi health ministry said it has opened an investigation into the incident. In their statement, they blamed the deaths on the Saudi coalition forces for causing a lack of available medicine in Houthi-controlled areas.

The family of one of the deceased children said that their son felt pains and cramps after receiving the expired chemotherapy treatment then died 5 days later. "The worst thing was that the hospital administration tried to hide the truth from us," said the boy's father, who asked not to be named for his and his family's safety.

[We are told in the news reports above that at least 10 children with leukemia died and many others were seriously ill after receiving injections of smuggled, expired methotrexate that was originally manufactured in India. The 1st news report above also added that "bacterial contamination" was found in the "injections administered to the children." In cancer chemotherapy, methotrexate functions as an anti-metabolite (folic acid antagonist), inhibiting the synthesis of the purines and pyrimidines that are necessary for nucleic acid synthesis. Methotrexate is also used as an immunosuppressant in auto-immune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis.

More information from knowledgeable sources would be appreciated on this outbreak, including confirmation of the bacterial species contaminating methotrexate injections and if there was bacterial contamination of unopened bottles of methotrexate, the drug's lot numbers, expiration dates, its source and distribution, the exact number of children who died and their causes of death after receiving this drug.

Yemen (pop., 30 491 000 in 2021) is a country on the southern end of the Arabian Peninsula, which borders Saudi Arabia to the north and Oman to the northeast (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen); its capital and largest city is Sanaa (pop., almost 4 million in 2012) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanaa). Since 2011, Yemen has been in a state of political crisis (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_Crisis_(2011-present)). - Mod.ML
