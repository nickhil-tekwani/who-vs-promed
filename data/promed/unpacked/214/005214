Update on avian influenza in Turkey and Romania
-----------------------------------------------
Samples collected from sick turkeys in Kiziksa, Balikesi in
Turkey and sent to the OIE Reference Laboratory for Avian
Influenza, Weybridge, UK have been confirmed today to
contain avian influenza virus H5N1. The virus isolated seems
to be very close to one of the viruses isolated in Siberia.
In Romania, laboratory tests conducted yesterday at the
Institute for Diagnostics and Animal Health (Bucharest) have
now identified the virus isolated from sick poultry in the
locality of Ceamurlia-de-Jos to be of subtype H5. Further
tests being necessary, confirmatory diagnoses are being
carried out in Weybridge, and results are expected soon. The
probability of finding the same virus is high.
The OIE again strongly recalls the importance for both
affected and at-risk countries of implementing all the
necessary measures to ensure the early detection of sick
poultry and a rapid response to the immediate control of the
animal disease. The rapid response consists of eliminating
the sick and in-contact animals in case of suspicion based
on clinical signs seen by veterinarians on the farm. Of
particular importance is the involvement of farmers in
reporting the 1st occurrence of unexplained mortalities in
their flocks and the creation of rapid and equitable
compensation schemes. Supporting national veterinary
services so that they can implement a rapid response in case
of suspicion and outbreak is also a crucial element in the
control of avian influenza in animals worldwide.
The OIE also recalls that the transmission of the AI virus
to humans by food consumption has not been reported. The
virus in meat is killed by cooking at 70 deg Celsius for
several seconds.

[The confirmation of H5N1 is only for Turkey, although H5
has been confirmed for Romania. The text of the OIE release
states there is a high probability of the virus being H5N1.
I also want to correct the record from my previous comment
in Avian Influenza - Asia (40), in which I suggest "spread
to Europe has been relatively rapid as the last official
reports placed the disease in the Urals." As Christian Griot
and others have pointed out, at that point, we had no
confirmation it was the same virus. I should have noted that
IF the virus is confirmed as H5N1, then spread to Europe was
rapid. Our readers do a tremendous service is
double-checking our postings, and it is a key contribution.
My apologies for the error, but at least now we have the
confirmation. Moreover, the press release notes that the
virus is similar to the ones found in Siberia. - Mod.PC]
