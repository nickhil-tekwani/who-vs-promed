Health partners in South Sudan have scaled-up efforts to halt a measles outbreak by vaccinating a total of 12 000 children in the Protection of Civilians (PoC) sites surrounding host communities in Juba. According to the humanitarian bulletin released on [Tue 1 Dec 2015], from the Office of the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) of the United Nations, the move comes in response to the new measles outbreak.

"Coordination Saves Lives have vaccinated over 12 000 children in the Protection of Civilians (PoC) sites and surrounding host communities in Juba in response to a new measles outbreak," reads the OCHA bulletin. "Since the beginning of October 2015, 15 suspected cases, all children under age of 5 have been reported from the Juba PoC site. The National Public Health Laboratory confirmed 9 of the 15 samples as positive for measles. In response, 3 fixed immunization sites and 4 outreach posts were established in the PoC, case search have been activated across South Sudan."

Humanitarian partners say that measles has been the 4th most common cause of morbidity in 2015 to date. "Of 1280 suspected measles cases reported since the beginning of 2015, most confirmed cases were from Central Equatoria (35 per cent) and Unity (35 per cent) states, while the rest were spread across Jonglei, Lakes, Upper Nile, Western Bahr El Ghazal, and Western Equatoria states" it says.

"Conflict, displacement and lack of access have frustrated efforts to ensure vaccination coverage. Only 6 out of South Sudan's 79 Counties have the requisite minimum 80 per cent measles vaccination coverage and 26 Counties with less than 20 per cent coverage, mostly in the Greater Upper Nile," OCHA explains. Partners said more than 230 000 vaccinations have been conducted in the hardest to reach areas through rapid response missions this year [2015]. However, an estimated 400 000 children under age 5 remain at risk of contracting the disease. "Severe measles is more likely among poorly nourished young children in refugee and internally displaced person (IDP) settings, especially those with insufficient vitamin A, or whose immune systems have been weakened by HIV/AIDS or other diseases. In populations with high levels of malnutrition and a lack of adequate health care, up to 10 per cent of measles cases result in death" according to OCHA.

Health officials in Nigeria are going out in force to vaccinate children against the very contagious viral disease, measles, with at least 3 states planning to vaccinate some 5 million children. In Kaduna State, 3 million children would be vaccinated during the ongoing immunization against measles in the state, according to Malam Hamza Ikara, Health Educator, Kaduna State Primary Healthcare Agency (SPHCA) [Sat 21 Nov 2015]. Ikara said in a statement that that children between 9 and 59 months would be vaccinated during the exercise, scheduled for 21-25 Nov [2015]. Kaduna has seen more than 700 measles cases in 2015 to date.

In Jigawa State, the government announced [Sat 21 Nov 2015] their plans to target some 1.3 million children across the state. State Immunization Officer, Alhaji Hassan Kwalam said 1440 designated vaccination centres would be used for the 5-day exercise.

A 5-day measles vaccination campaign will also began in Kebbi State. Dr Farouk Wakili, the Chairman of Kebbi State Primary Healthcare Development Agency said the campaign would target 700 000 children; 7775 trained health personnel were conducting the vaccination in 225 wards comprising 1125 centres, Wakili said.

According to the World Health Organization, in 2014, there were 114 900 measles deaths globally -- about 314 deaths every day or 13 deaths every hour. Measles vaccination resulted in a 79 percent drop in measles deaths between 2000 and 2014 worldwide and during 2000-2014, measles vaccination prevented an estimated 17.1 million deaths.

Health officials in the Central African country of Cameroon are expressing concern over the measles epidemic that has been spreading across the country. To date, 858 cases have been recorded in some "hard-to-reach" communities, according to the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). To compound the issue, health authorities say the outbreak has spread to areas controlled by the Nigerian terrorist group, Boko Haram. The security situation in the Far North Region is critical. The government of Cameroon government has declared a state of emergency in the region.

In an IFRC statement, "Of all the recorded cases, the Mokolo health district (Mayo-Tsanaga department) in the Far North region accounts for 587 cases, with a population of 211 906 inhabitants, presenting an extremely concerning attack rate." They go on to say "the Mokolo health district is located close to the Chadian and Nigerian border, raising the risk of measles epidemic spreading. It can quickly engulf all the 3 countries making the situation difficult to address, given the implementation challenges experienced in the areas, which are extremely insecure."

Measles and rubella are serious and contagious diseases with serious consequences. However, they can be eliminated by vaccination; however, for vaccination to be effective at a population level, coverage must remain above 80 per cent and coverage in Cameroon has been consistently below this level, meaning significant parts of the population are at risk, including infants (too young to be vaccinated). The IFRC is strategizing to get children in the area vaccinated, which includes human resources, security, logistics, and supply chain and communications.

Measles Outbreaks Are a Sign of Bigger Problems
------------------------------------------
This year [2015] was supposed to mark the point when measles -- one of the most infectious diseases on the planet -- was finally under control. As a step in its plan to eliminate measles worldwide by 2020, the World Health Organization set a target to reduce the number of cases by 95 percent between 2000 and 2015. The effect has been significant: Measles deaths have fallen from more than 700 000 in 2000 to around 115 000 last year [2014]. But for a disease that's easily preventable, 115 000 deaths -- the majority of them children under 5 years old -- is still too high. And as the WHO reported in November [2015], progress has flat-lined over the past 5 years, and outbreaks are still common.

What, exactly, went wrong?

At 1st glance, it seems impossible to pinpoint just one reason for all the various outbreaks around the world. In the Nuba mountains of Sudan, a key factor is the lack of access to humanitarian aid for people trapped in conflict zones; in West Africa, a measles resurgence can be attributed largely to the Ebola epidemic's crippling effect on local health systems. And in California, the blame rests squarely on the shoulders of anti-vaccine groups for whipping up unfounded fears about the safety of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccines.

However, all of these seemingly disparate cases -- and all other measles outbreaks, for that matter -- still have a common underlying cause. Whenever measles strikes, it's more than just an outbreak of a single disease, or an indication that children aren't receiving their measles shots; it's also a warning that immunization coverage in general, for all vaccine-preventable diseases, is lower than it should be. To put it another way: When rates of routine vaccination -- children receiving all their shots on schedule, as a preventive measure rather than a reaction to an outbreak -- start to fall, the 1st sign is usually a measles outbreak. In global-health security terms, these outbreaks are the proverbial canaries in the coal mine.

Measles is considered such an integral part of the global-health agenda for precisely that reason: Its contagious nature makes it a good proxy for assessing immunization levels for all vaccine-preventable diseases. But in light of the WHO's recent report about global progress towards eliminating measles -- or, perhaps more accurately, the lack thereof -- it's clear the current approach isn't working as well as it should be.

Because measles is so infectious compared to other diseases -- so contagious, in fact, it's possible to catch it just by entering a room, hours after an infected person has been there -- a much higher level of immunization coverage is required in order to achieve herd immunity. For many common infectious diseases, herd immunity kicks in when 80 to 85 percent of the population has been immunized. But for measles, an outbreak can occur as soon as coverage drops below 90 percent.

Such a high level of contagion means it's futile to attempt to eliminate the disease from each affected region in isolation. At the beginning of the 21st century, health authorities in the western hemisphere came close, reducing the number of cases in the region by 99 percent from where they'd been in 1990 -- but high levels of immunity weren't maintained, and the Americas saw new outbreaks a few years later as the virus made its way over from other parts of the world.

In general, though, elimination efforts have generally relied on region-by-region mass measles-vaccination campaigns. These campaigns are often too reactive to be effective over the long term, treating the symptom of a measles outbreak rather than the broader cause: a lack of routine immunizations. While mass vaccination against a single disease is certainly an effective tool in helping health officials respond to outbreaks, it can also draw attention and resources away from more farsighted efforts to increase routine immunization coverage. As a result, it can inadvertently increase the risk of future outbreaks of measles and other infectious diseases.

The elimination of measles, then, may depend on a more sweeping, less targeted strategy. In the remaining 5 years until 2020, the year that was supposed to mark the total elimination of measles, the WHO and other global-health agencies may be more effective if they focus their resources on routine immunizations that boost population immunity against multiple diseases, rather than playing catch-up with just one. As Tom Frieden, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) once noted, "A measles outbreak anywhere is a risk everywhere" -- and for more reasons than measles alone.
