Re: Hongjie Yu, Joseph T Wu, Benjamin J Cowling et al. Effect of closure of live poultry markets on poultry-to-person transmission of avian influenza A H7N9 virus: an ecological study. Lancet, Early Online Publication -- Summary
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Background
----------
Transmission of the novel avian influenza A H7N9 virus seems to be predominantly between poultry and people. In the major Chinese cities of Shanghai, Hangzhou, Huzhou, and Nanjing ­- where most human cases of infection have occurred ­- live poultry markets (LPMs) were closed in April 2013, soon after the initial outbreak, as a precautionary public health measure. Our objective was to quantify the effect of LPM closure in these cities on poultry-to-person transmission of avian influenza A H7N9 virus.

Methods
-------
We obtained information about every laboratory-confirmed human case of avian influenza A H7N9 virus infection reported in the 4 cities by 7 Jun 2013, from a database built by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. We used data for age, sex, location, residence type (rural or urban area), and dates of illness onset. We obtained information about LPMs from official sources. We constructed a statistical model to explain the patterns in incidence of cases reported in each city on the basis of the assumption of a constant force of infection before LPM closure, and a different constant force of infection after closure. We fitted the model with Markov chain Monte Carlo methods.

Findings
--------
A total of 85 human cases of avian influenza A H7N9 virus infection were reported in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Huzhou, and Nanjing by 7 Jun 2013, of which 60 were included in our main analysis. Closure of LPMs reduced the mean daily number of infections by 99 percent (95 percent credibility interval 93­100 percent) in Shanghai, by 99 percent (92­100 percent) in Hangzhou, by 97 percent (68­100 percent) in Huzhou, and by 97 percent (81­100 percent) in Nanjing. Because LPMs were the predominant source of exposure to avian influenza A H7N9 virus for confirmed cases in these cities, we estimated that the mean incubation period was 3.3 days (range 1.4­-5.7).

Interpretation
--------------
LPM closures were effective in the control of human risk of avian influenza A H7N9 virus infection in the spring of 2013. In the short term, LPM closure should be rapidly implemented in areas where the virus is identified in live poultry or people. In the long term, evidence-based discussions and deliberations about the role of market rest days and central slaughtering of all live poultry should be renewed.

China should close live poultry markets in big cities to disrupt the spread of a new strain of bird flu that resurfaced there earlier this month [October 2013], scientists said, after a previous shutdown was found to have slashed the number of human cases.

In a study published in The Lancet medical journal on Thursday [31 Oct 2013], researchers from Hong Kong and China said that while closing markets during the height of the 1st outbreak of H7N9 in April may have been costly, it reduced human infections dramatically and should be done again if cases rise as feared.

The findings -- of a more than 97 percent reduction in the daily number of human cases of the new H7N9 strain after the markets were closed compared with before -- should give policy-makers confidence that the economic costs of shutting markets is balanced by significant health gains.

"(This) is a highly effective intervention to prevent human disease and protect public health," said Benjamin Cowling of Hong Kong University, who led the study and had it published in the Lancet medical journal.

Based on his findings, he said the best approach to minimize the spread of the H7N9 bird flu virus ahead of an expected surge in cases during the winter flu season would be to shut down markets wherever the virus is detected.

A total of 2 new human cases of H7N9 bird flu were found in China's eastern Zhejiang province in October [2013], the 1st in what some flu experts fear may be a fresh epidemic of the deadly disease to come during China's colder winter months.

"This is of great concern because it reveals that the H7N9 virus has continued to circulate and now has the potential to re-emerge in a new outbreak of human disease this winter," said Cowling, echoing similar fears expressed by Chinese researchers in a study published last week.

Some 45 people have so far been killed by H7N9 flu strain, many of them during a flare-up in March and April [2013] just after the virus 1st emerged in humans earlier in February.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) says it has now recorded 137 laboratory confirmed cases, suggesting a death rate for the new strain of more than 30 percent.

At the start of April [2013], several weeks after the 1st human cases of H7N9 bird flu emerged, 780 live poultry markets in the Chinese cities of Shanghai, Hangzhou, Huzhou and Nanjing were closed to try and halt virus spread.

The closures have been estimated to have cost more than RMB 57 billion (USD 9.35 billion), so Cowling's team set out to study whether those costs could be justified.

The team analyzed data on every laboratory confirmed case of H7N9 in those 4 cities up to 1 Jun 2013 [7 Jun 2013 according to the summary above] and entered them into a statistical calculation method called a Bayesian model which was able to quantify the before-and-after effects of shutting down the markets.

The results found the closures cut the average daily number of H7N9 human infections by 99 percent in Shanghai, 99 percent in Hangzhou, 97 percent in Huzhou and 97 percent in Nanjing.

"Without this robust evidence, policy-makers would struggle to justify further closures of LPMs because of the millennia-old culture of trading live birds and the potential huge economic loss on the poultry industry in China," said Cowling.

Yet with it, he added, the best course of action to minimize the spread of the virus ahead of the expected surge in infections in the winter would be sustained live poultry market closure in areas of high risk of disease spread, and immediate market closure in areas where the virus appears in future.

[The H7N9 event started in Eastern China in February 2013; there are preliminary signs that it is to return for 2nd season during the winter months ahead.

In June 2013, 2 of China's leading researchers, Wu Ying and George F. Gao, wrote (see ref):

"There are some discussions as to whether or not we should permanently shut down the live market as it challenges the traditional lifestyle and has side-effects on the economy. The agriculture sector argues that the H7N9 does not cause any diseases for poultry therefore it should not be called avian influenza virus. Whereas Li et al. unambiguously demonstrated the relatedness of human infection with poultry or poultry related market. The question can be open for further discussion and we also need to see the circulation trends of the virus in the future. At least this virus should be called avian-origin influenza virus. Preliminary estimates show that the agriculture sector lost at least RMB 57 billion [USD 9.35 billion] because of the live free market shut-down. Therefore this outbreak is not only a health problem but also a serious economic issue. Burden of disease (BOD) caused by this H7N9 outbreak should be accessed in the near future to guide our future disease control and prevention."

The current paper provides information which is meant to assist China's policy makers in their complex, urgent decision, whether or not, and where, to permanently or seasonally shut down the live poultry markets.
