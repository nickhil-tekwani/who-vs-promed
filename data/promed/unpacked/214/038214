["A FMD outbreak due to serotype O occurred on [22 Nov 2016], in cattle in Zabajkal`Skij Kray, Russian Federation. VP1 sequences provided by FGBI-ARRIAH to the WRLFMD of samples collected from this outbreak were identified as O/ME-SA/Ind-2001d, which confirm the results obtained by FGBIARRIAH". http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/eufmd/docs/FMD_monthly_reports/2016/November_2016.pdf

"Further to the outbreak on [22 Nov 2016], 2 other FMD outbreaks involving different species were registered on [ 27 Nov and 14 Dec 2016] in Zabajkal`Skij Kray, Russian Federation. FMD laboratory diagnosis for the 2 outbreaks was respectively confirmed on [1st and 16 Dec 2016] and was carried out by FGBI-ARRIAH, the OIE Reference Laboratory using antigen detection ELISA, RT-PCR and complement fixation test.

These events were caused by FMDV serotype O [FMDV O/ME-SA/Ind2001d lineage], that was also responsible for the previous outbreak. Morbidity rates were particularly high for cattle as well as for pigs in the outbreak that occurred on [27 Nov 2016]. [Note: see event summary and report of the outbreaks occurred in Zabajkal`Skij Kray at, http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=21688]

Vaccine matching tests carried out on field isolates belonging FMDV serotype O provided good matching results with the following vaccine strains: O Manisa, O PanAsia/2012, O/SEA, O/Russia/2000 (PanAsia) and O/PanAsia2. In addition, the laboratory carried out the testing of 2000 sera for post-vaccination monitoring. The laboratory provided support in the epidemiological investigations of FMD outbreaks". http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/eufmd/docs/FMD_monthly_reports/2016/December_2016.pdf. - Mod.CRD
