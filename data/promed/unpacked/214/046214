The coronavirus responsible for Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is prevalent in camels throughout Saudi Arabia and has been around for at least 20 years, according to a study to be published in mBio(R), the online open-access journal of the American Society for Microbiology [see item 2 below].

"Our study shows the MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is widespread," says senior study author W Ian Lipkin of Columbia University, New York. "Adult camels were more likely to have antibodies to the virus while juveniles were more likely to have active virus. This indicates that infection in camels typically occurs in early life, and that if people get the virus from camels the most likely source is young camels."

MERS, a serious viral respiratory illness, has been identified in 182 people from 2012 through 7 Feb 2014, according to the World Health Organization; 79 people have died from the condition. While most infections have occurred in Saudi Arabia, the origin of disease, in most cases, has remained unknown. Efforts to identify an animal source of infection have focused on bats and camels. The 1st known case of MERS was in a Saudi Arabian man who had 4 pet camels.

In the study, investigators from the United States and Saudi Arabia conducted a comprehensive survey of dromedary camels throughout Saudi Arabia. They collected blood samples and rectal and nasal swabs from camels, sheep, and goats in November and December of 2013. Using mobile laboratory equipment, they tested blood samples for antibodies reactive with MERS-CoV, and the swabs and blood for active virus. They also analyzed archived blood samples from dromedary camels taken from 1992 through 2010.

Overall, 74 percent of camels sampled countrywide had antibodies to MERS-CoV. More than 80 percent of adult camels throughout the country had antibodies to the virus, while in camels age 2 or younger the prevalence ranged from 90 percent in the east to 5 percent in the southwest. Antibodies to the virus were seen in camel serum samples dating back to 1992, which strongly suggests that either MERS-CoV or a closely related virus has been circulating in the Saudi Arabian animals for at least 2 decades.

The researchers also found that active virus was frequently detected in nasal swabs in 35 percent of young camels and 15 percent of adult camels countrywide. It was less frequently found in rectal swabs and not in blood, indicating that the virus most likely is spread by respiratory secretions.

While they speculate that camels are potential reservoirs for human transmission, the authors say the current study does not prove that. "Our findings suggest that continuous, longer-term surveillance will be necessary to determine the dynamics of virus circulation in dromedary camel populations."

Lead authors for the paper were Abdulaziz Alagaili of King Saud University and the Saudi Wildlife Authority in Riyadh and Thomas Briese of Columbia University.

Abstract
--------
The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is proposed to be a zoonotic disease; however, the reservoir and mechanism for transmission of the causative agent, the MERS coronavirus, are unknown. Dromedary camels have been implicated through reports that some victims have been exposed to camels, camels in areas where the disease has emerged have antibodies to the virus, and viral sequences have been recovered from camels in association with outbreaks of the disease among humans.

Nonetheless, whether camels mediate transmission to humans is unresolved. Here we provide evidence from a geographic and temporal survey of camels in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia [KSA] that MERS coronaviruses have been circulating in camels since at least 1992, are distributed countrywide, and can be phylogenetically classified into clades that correlate with outbreaks of the disease among humans. We found no evidence of infection in domestic sheep or domestic goats.

Discussion
----------
MERS-CoV is posited to be a zoonosis. However, the evolutionary history of MERS-CoV and the reservoirs and vectors for human infection remain obscure. Early anecdotal reports that some MERS-CoV victims had exposure to dromedary camels (DC) led to serologic investigation of DC in Spain and Oman, Jordan, Egypt, and the KSA that revealed antibodies to MERS-CoV. Definitive evidence that DC can be infected with MERS-CoV was obtained when viral sequences were detected in nasal swabs from DC sampled in close proximity to outbreaks of the disease among humans in Qatar and Jeddah, KSA. Nonetheless, current data do not fulfill the 2 criteria required to implicate DC as a significant reservoir species in the epidemiology of MERS-CoV, that is, (i) that DC are sufficient to maintain MERS-CoV and (ii) that the presence of DC is essential to the continuous transmission of infection. Results presented here do not establish the latter; however, they do provide evidence for the former.

Our study is the 1st comprehensive countrywide survey of DC from the KSA, the country with the most recorded MERS-CoV cases, to use both serological and molecular diagnostic methods.

Analysis of specimens from western regions of the country, from Tabuk in the northwest, Taif in the west, and Gizan in the southwest, revealed regional differences. Although the seroprevalence was high in adults throughout the country at more than 80 percent, in juveniles, it ranged from 90 percent in the east to 5 percent in the southwest. The seroprevalence in DC up to 2 years of age was lower than that in older animals. Molecular analysis of nasal and rectal swab specimens indicated the highest prevalence of MERS-CoV sequences in DC in the west and northwest. Nasal swabs with heavy sequence loads (more than 100 000 copies) also clustered in the Taif region. A 2nd sample collection in the west (Taif) separated from the 1st by an interval of 2 months confirmed the presence of heavy viral sequence loads in nasal swabs collected from juvenile animals sampled in this area (data not shown). These findings suggest that continuous, longer-term surveillance is necessary to determine the dynamics of virus circulation in DC populations. Lower prevalence rates of both MERS-CoV and Bo-CoV [bovine coronavirus] were evident in samples from the southwest. This may relate in part to the enforcement of restrictions of livestock movement in and out of Gizan Province implemented after the Rift Valley fever outbreak in 2000 but also to the generally lower DC population density in this region than in other regions of the KSA [See Table S1 in the supplemental material at http://mbio.asm.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1128/mBio.00884-14/-/DCSupplemental].

Viral nucleic acids were more commonly detected in nasal swabs than in rectal specimens and were more frequent in juvenile than in adult animals. These findings, together with the absence of viremia and the known respiratory tract tropism of several other coronaviruses, suggest that airborne transmission is the most likely mode of MERS-CoV transmission. Although nucleic acid copy numbers were commonly highest in juvenile animals that were seronegative or had low antibody titers, positive findings were also obtained with specimens from highly seropositive and adult animals.

Our findings in archived DC specimens, although restricted to serology, strongly suggest that MERS-CoV or a closely related virus has been circulating in DC in the KSA for at least 2 decades. Complete genomic sequences of MERS-CoV found in contemporary DC in the KSA are identical to sequences of viruses recovered from human MERS-CoV victims (unpublished data). Although we speculate that DC are potential reservoirs for human transmission, we cannot prove this relationship from the current data. Rigorous epidemiological investigation of the potential for exposure to DC in sporadic cases of MERS-CoV (those where there is no opportunity for human-to-human transmission) is required to test this model.

If DC can be implicated, other questions will arise. Did MERS-CoV truly emerge as a human pathogen in 2012, or were cases of cryptic infection not appreciated because of a lack of suitable diagnostic tests? We may be able to address this conundrum by using archived human materials. If evidence of human MERS-CoV infections cannot be detected prior to 2012, we must entertain the possibility that mutation facilitated cross-species transmission. However, we see no path to address this possibility absent access to historical DC respiratory tract specimens. The only archived DC specimens we have been able to locate are DC sera; our efforts to recover MERS-CoV sequences from camel blood have been unsuccessful.

What are the roles of bats, if any, as reservoirs of MERS-CoV? These limitations notwithstanding, the most urgent public health concern, raised in work we and others have reported that focuses on DC infection, is to determine the role of these animals in sporadic human infection. The evidence is clearly sufficient to support targeted investigation of direct or indirect exposure to DC in the disease among humans.
