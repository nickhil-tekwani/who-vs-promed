The source of the meat that made dozens of teachers and staff ill following a luncheon at Roosevelt High School in October 2015 has been revealed. The taco meat was purchased from the Windsor Heights Hy-Vee at 11:39 am on 21 Oct 2015, then served at the luncheon about an hour later. A district spokesperson said the meat was left out on a table in a warming tray for the hour before it was served. School officials were forced to dismiss classes early on 22 Oct 2015 after 58 employees were sickened.

The Polk County Health Department issued the findings of its investigation into the food poisoning incident. The department said the bacterium _Clostridium perfringens_ was found in the taco meat and in stool samples from those who became sick. The report also noted "a specific point in the food preparation and handling process could not be identified as responsible."

The Health Department said the bacteria often infects meats that are prepared in large batches and left warming for an extended of time. It adds food that is not served or refrigerated promptly is also susceptible to bacteria growth.

"We do know that this bacterium is one that is temperature sensitive," said health department spokesperson Nola Ainger. "You could say the meat wasn't cooked thoroughly and then it wasn't reheated to a temperature thoroughly but we can't speculate on that because there are so many periods of time where this could have happened."

A spokesperson for Hy-Vee confirmed that school officials picked up the taco meat from the Windsor Heights store but claims it was prepared properly.

[Unlike staphylococcal foodborne illness in which the preformed toxin is ingested, in _C. perfringens_ disease the enterotoxin is formed _in situ_ in the gastrointestinal tract. The following discussion is obtained from the FDA Bad Bug Book http://www.fda.gov/food/foodsafety/foodborneillness/foodborneillnessfoodbornepathogensnaturaltoxins/badbugbook/ucm070483.htm:

"1. Name of the Organism:
_Clostridium perfringens_ is an anaerobic, Gram-positive, spore-forming rod. It is widely distributed in the environment and frequently occurs in the intestines of humans and many domestic and feral animals. Spores of the organism persist in soil, sediments, and areas subject to human or animal fecal pollution.

2. Nature of Acute Disease:
Perfringens food poisoning is the term used to describe the common foodborne illness caused by _C. perfringens_. A more serious but rare illness is also caused by ingesting food contaminated with Type C strains. The latter illness is known as enteritis necroticans or pig-bel disease.

3. Nature of Disease:
The common form of perfringens poisoning is characterized by intense abdominal cramps and diarrhea which begin 8-22 hours after consumption of foods containing large numbers of those _C. perfringens_ bacteria capable of producing the food poisoning toxin. The illness is usually over within 24 hours, but less severe symptoms may persist in some individuals for 1-2 weeks. A few deaths have been reported as a result of dehydration and other complications.

Necrotic enteritis (pig-bel) caused by _C. perfringens_ is often fatal. This disease also begins as a result of ingesting large numbers of the causative bacteria in contaminated foods. Deaths from necrotic enteritis (pig-bel syndrome) are caused by infection and necrosis of the intestines and from resulting septicemia. This disease is very rare in the USA.

Infective dose: The symptoms are caused by ingestion of large numbers (more than 100 000 000) vegetative cells. Toxin production in the digestive tract (or in test tubes) is associated with sporulation. This disease is a food infection; only 1 episode has ever implied the possibility of intoxication (i.e., disease from preformed toxin).

4. Diagnosis of Human Illness:
Perfringens poisoning is diagnosed by its symptoms and the typical delayed onset of illness. Diagnosis is confirmed by detecting the toxin in the feces of patients. Bacteriological confirmation can also be done by finding exceptionally large numbers of the causative bacteria in implicated foods or in the feces of patients.

5. Associated Foods:
In most instances, the actual cause of poisoning by _C. perfringens_ is temperature abuse of prepared foods. Small numbers of the organisms are often present after cooking and multiply to food poisoning levels during cool down and storage of prepared foods. Meats, meat products, and gravy are the foods most frequently implicated.

6. Relative Frequency of Disease:
Perfringens poisoning is among the most commonly reported foodborne illnesses in the USA. There were 1162 cases in 1981, in 28 separate outbreaks. At least 10-20 outbreaks have been reported annually in the USA for the past 2 decades. Typically, dozens or even hundreds of persons are affected. It is probable that many outbreaks go unreported because the implicated foods or patient feces are not tested routinely for _C. perfringens_ or its toxin. CDC estimates that about 10 000 actual cases occur annually in the USA.

7. Course of Disease and Complications:
The disease generally lasts 24 hours. In the elderly or infirm, symptoms may last 1-2 weeks. Complications and/or death only very rarely occur.

8. Target Populations:
Institutional feeding (such as school cafeterias, hospitals, nursing homes, prisons, etc.) where large quantities of food are prepared several hours before serving is the most common circumstance in which perfringens poisoning occurs. The young and elderly are the most frequent victims of perfringens poisoning. Except in the case of pig-bel syndrome, complications are few in persons under 30 years of age. Elderly persons are more likely to experience prolonged or severe symptoms.

9. Food Analysis:
Standard bacteriological culturing procedures are used to detect the organism in implicated foods and in feces of patients. Serological assays are used for detecting enterotoxin in the feces of patients and for testing the ability of strains to produce toxin. The procedures take 1-3 days."
