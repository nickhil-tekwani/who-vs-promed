A 32-year-old traveler was diagnosed with brucellosis after returning from a vacation in Myanmar. Consumption of milk and Lassi [traditional yogurt-based drink] was remembered. Treatment was started with rifampicin/doxycycline, which led to a clinical improvement.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Weigand for his first-hand report of brucellosis imported from Myanmar to Germany. Other travelers may also have been exposed. We would appreciate more information regarding the species of the organism and the clinical manifestations of the case. - Mod.LL]

[Additional information on the geographic locations where milk products were ingested within Myanmar would be of interest.

For the interactive HealthMap/ProMED map of Germany, see http://healthmap.org/r/1zJl; for the interactive HealthMap/ProMED map of Myanmar, see http://healthmap.org/r/1Ayf. - Mod.MPP]

[According to OIE's data, bovine brucellosis (_Brucella abortus_) is present in Myanmar; it is not a notifiable disease. Myanmar has not provided the OIE information on the situation regarding _Brucella melitensis_. In 2008, brucellosis was included among the zoonotic diseases reported in humans in Myanmar without quantitative data. It was not mentioned in the reports for the years 2009-2011. - Mod.AS]
