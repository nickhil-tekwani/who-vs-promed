There has been no outbreak of malaria in Gauteng, but the province remains
concerned and on "high alert" about the rapidly increasing infection rate
since the beginning of 2006, the province's health department said.
A spokesperson for the provincial health department, Bhungani ka Mzolo,
said that the infection rate had by the end of last week climbed to 473
with 6 dead. One person died at the Kalafong Hospital in Tshwane, 2 at
Tembisa Hospital, one at Tambo Memorial Hospital, one at Edenvale Hospital
and another at Coronation Hospital. According to ka Mzolo, many patients
have been treated and discharged, but seriously ill people remain in
hospital for further treatment and observation.
Of the 202 cases noted in Ekurhuleni, where the most cases were reported,
119 people have been discharged, on the West Rand 45 cases has been noted
and 39 patients discharged; while in the Johannesburg Metro area 142 cases
have been noted and 21 discharged. In Tshwane, 59 cases have been noted and
26 people have been discharged (one person refused treatment); and in
Sedibeng 35 cases were seen and 20 patients discharged.
"There is no outbreak in Gauteng. It is people who travelled outside
Gauteng that contracted the disease. Holidaymakers coming back from the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mozambique, Namibia and Limpopo are the
ones being treated in local hospitals," ka Mzolo said. According to the
statement, symptoms of the diseases included coughing, sweating and body
temperature fluctuations.
Any person who travelled outside the province borders and experienced
symptoms resembling those of cold should report to the nearest health
institution for a check-up, the statement said. Ka Mzolo added that the
situation was under control, while Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa urged health
institutions to be on high alert and on the lookout for malaria cases.

[Gauteng covers 17 000 sq. kilometres and includes the cities of
Johannesburg and Pretoria. The district has 8 million inhabitants. The area
is not regarded suitable for malaria transmission due to the climate. Maps
of malaria transmission in Africa including South Africa can be found at
<http://www.mara.org.za>.
With extensive travel to other countries in Southern Africa with
substantial malaria transmission and the use of prophylaxis probably not
the rule, 473 imported cases from a background population of 8 million does
not seem entirely unrealistic. Although year-round malaria transmission may
not be possible because it is too cold during the winter season, secondary
cases transmitted by local mosquitoes during summer months from imported
cases cannot be ruled out. - Mod.EP]
[There is excellent control of malaria in South Africa. Nevertheless in 2
provinces, namely Kwazalu Natal and Mpulamanga (formerly
Transvaal), there is a risk of malaria transmission, although it is very
limited in the north and northeastern areas. In the past malaria was often
introduced by people infected while travelling through the Kruger Park,
who then introduced the parasite while seeking work into other areas where
there were sometimes anopheline malaria vectors. The main vectors in South
Africa are _Anopheles gambiae_, which has spread malaria in the Kwazulu
area; _An. funestus_, which has been the vector in the Drackensburg area;
and possibly the related species _An. aruni_.
Recently, in 1999-2000, _An. funestus_ in the Kwazula area has shown
resistance to the pyrethroid insecticides. Whether or not malaria cases in
Gauteng were due to local transmission or were imported remains
questionable. Further information on this would be welcomed. - Mod.MS]
