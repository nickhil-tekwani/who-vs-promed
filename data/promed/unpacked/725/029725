The potentially-deadly Japanese encephalitis virus has been found in
Australia. The virus has been isolated in an exotic mosquito [see below
which is found in the Torres Strait, Queensland and the Northern Territory.
Scott Ritchie from the Tropical Public Health Unit says, fortunately, there
is only a slight risk the mosquito may spread the virus during the wet
season. "Most of the islands where it has been a problem where we've had
human cases have been communities with penned domestic pigs in the
backyard, right in the community. It requires pigs to be present in high
concentration," he said.

[Scott tells us that the single isolate was from _Culex gelidus_
mosquitoes. That is what is new, not the fact that JEV occurs in Badu in
the Torres Strait. - Mod. CHC
