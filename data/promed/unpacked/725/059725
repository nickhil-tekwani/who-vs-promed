Chikungunya disease has resurfaced in Ganjam district of Odisha, prompting health officials to gear up to prevent its spread.

At least 4 persons have tested positive for chikungunya so far at Bichhanapalli village under Ganjam block, official sources said today [6 Jan 2013]. "Blood samples sent to the microbiology department of MKCG Medical College and Hospital have tested positive for chikungunya [virus or antibody?]," said additional district medical officer (public health) LK Rath.

[The] outbreak of chikungunya in Bichhanapalli was reported when a number of people complained of fever with joint pain. A team of doctors from Berhampur visited the village and collected blood samples for testing as the clinical symptoms of the patients pointed to mosquito-borne viral disease.

Rath, however, said there is no need to panic as no fresh case of fever has been reported from the village. A team of doctors, led by district malaria officer (DMO) US Mishra along with paramedics visited the area 2 days ago to treat affected persons and sensitise people about the disease.

The main reason for outbreaks of chikungunya, malaria, dengue, and Japanese encephalitis is water stagnation, in which larvae originate and spread infection, said a doctor. People should take steps to prevent water stagnation to prevent breeding of mosquitoes, he added.

The team also created awareness to destroy stagnant water and dry water-logging spots in the village, said the DMO. "The diseases are under control as health officials have taken several steps to prevent their spread," Mishra said.

While the district reported over 500 dengue cases in 2012, around 30 people mostly from Boxipalli, a predominantly fisherman village in the district, suffered from chikungunya [virus infections].

[These 4 or more 2013 cases of chikungunya virus infections may be a continuation of the 2012 outbreak in the same locality mentioned in the report above. Chikungunya virus is endemic in India and cases appear sporadically in diverse locations, such as the Ganjam district. If the chikungunya virus vector mosquitoes, _Aedes aegypti_, are present, as is likely, the occurrence of additional cases can be expected unless the vector control efforts are effective. There is no commercially available chikungunya virus vaccine.
