Cholera has currently spread to 13 provinces and the epidemic will
only gain further momentum due to migrating bacterial carriers,
warned the Health Ministry Thu 8 Nov 2007. Notably, 2 chefs of a
5-star hotel and a restaurant in Hanoi tested positive for the
cholera bacterium.

The 2 new provinces on the cholera map are Nam Dinh and Ha Nam, with
one cholera patient each. The total number of patients by 8 Nov 2007
was over 1200. The 2 patients in Nam Dinh and Ha Nam ate salad,
noodle soup, and dog meat (no shrimp paste) in Hanoi before they
returned to their homes. Health experts warn the epidemic spreads
because of movement between provinces

Nguyen Huy Nga, Head of Preventive Health, said that cholera patients
are mainly over 20, and are laborers and farmers who travel often.

Deputy Minister of Health Trinh Quan Huan said that passengers at
coach and railway stations and airports in Hanoi who will travel to
other provinces must take special care. He also noted that people who
stay at hospitals to care for cholera patients are the sources of cholera.

[3] Cholera - Iraq: WHO report
Date: Sun 4 Nov 2007

(OCHA), ReliefWeb, WHO report [edited]
<http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/LSGZ-78RDC6?OpenDocument>


New laboratory-confirmed cholera cases reported during 22-28 Oct 2007:
- Kirkuk: 22 (of 410 samples tested) 5.4 percent
- Sulaymaniyah: 7 (samples tested not reported)
- Erbil: 10 (of 408 samples tested) 2 percent
- Baghdad: 13 (The number of stool samples tested not reported)
Total new cases 51

Overview
--------
The most important development this week is the steep increase in the
number of cholera cases reported from Baghdad compared to last week.
The number of laboratory confirmed cases jumped from 11 to 24 cholera
cases representing an increase of 227 percent in the cumulative
cases. 26 percent of new confirmed cholera cases this week were
reported from Baghdad Resafa; mainly from the highest risk areas in
the 3 most disadvantaged districts in Baghdad (Sadder City, Me'dain,
and Resafa districts). Data provided from Baghdad is neither complete
nor timely; therefore what is reported may be an underestimation of
the real situation.

As of 4 Nov 2007, 45 districts, 28 in northern Iraq and 17 in the
center and south have reported laboratory confirmed cases of cholera.
In northern Iraq, 13 out of the 14 districts of Sulaymaniyah
governorate, all 5 districts of Kirkuk governorate, 6 of 7 districts
of Erbil governorate, and 4 districts in Dahuk. As for the centre and
South; the affected districts are: 3 districts in each of Baghdad,
Tikrit, Mosul, and Diyala; 2 districts in Basra as well as one
district in each of Wasit and Anbar.

The results of the samples of _Vibrio cholerae_ isolates from
Sulaymaniyah, Kirkuk, Erbil, and Central Public Health Laboratory in
Baghdad were received by the US Naval Medical Research Unit No. 3
(NAMRU-3) laboratory, Cairo. NAMRU-3 results confirmed Sulaymaniyah-
and Central Public Health Laboratory (CPHL) results, confirming that
the outbreak was caused by _Vibrio cholerae_ O1 El Tor Inaba, which
is sensitive to the commonly used antibiotics, the isolated strains
were found resistant to trimethoprim-cotrimoxazole.

99 percent of Iraq's cholera cases were reported from Kirkuk,
Sulaymaniyah, and Erbil, northern Iraq. Sporadic cases with definite
history of travel and food consumption in Kirkuk were reported from
Tikrit province; however, isolated cases with no epidemiological link
to northern Iraq were also confirmed in Mosul, Wasit, Baghdad, Anbar,
and Basra.

One of the important features in this outbreak is that most of the
cases seen have mild to moderate signs and symptoms. The traditional
signs and symptoms of severe dehydrating diarrhea were seen only very
occasionally, out of the 4527 laboratory-confirmed cholera cases; 22
deaths were reported, most of the deceased had other, serious
underlying morbidity.

Specific control measures to contain this ongoing outbreak and limit
its spread to other areas have been reinforced by the concerned
governmental departments of the affected provinces, with technical
support from WHO. In non-epidemic provinces, during the period 14
Aug-4 Nov 2007, 53 cholera cases were discovered.

[4] Diarrhea - Philippines: (Northern Samar)
Date: Fri 9 Nov 2007
Source: GMA News [edited]
<http://www.gmanews.tv/story/68042/Diarrhea-outbreak-kills-1-affects-105-others-in-N-Samar>


At least one resident has died while at least 105 others were
affected in a diarrhea outbreak that started in Northern Samar
province 2 weeks ago. Radio dzRH reported late Fri afternoon [9 Nov
2007] that the number of cases from Burabod village in Gamay town
were a "trickle" at first, but greatly increased after 1 Nov 2007.

Provincial health officer Mary Ann Avalon said her staff recorded at
least 106 cases since 27 Oct 2007, with the lone fatality so far
being a 47-year-old woman. She said the outbreak could have stemmed
from a water supply contaminated by human and animal waste, and
spread by recent rains.

Making matters worse, she said, was that only 3 percent of the
village's 10 000 residents have toilets in their homes. Avalon said
that at least 65 of the victims remain confined at the Gamay district
hospital, while 41 were classified as outpatients. However, Avalon
voiced fears there may be other cases from at least 8 neighboring
villages that get their water from Burabod village.

Gamay has a population of 21 314 people in 4434 households.

[5] Cholera, refugee camps - Congo DR: (North Kivu)
Date: Fri 9 Nov 2007

Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) report [edited]
<http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/UNHCR/a35f11bb75db3917bcfeb9752206b1f3.htm>


UNHCR and its partners have stepped up this week efforts to curb the
spread of cholera which broke out in early October 2007 in 5 camps
hosting some 45 000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the
Mugunga area west of Goma in the troubled North Kivu province of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). According to health workers,
by the end of October 2007, there were a total of 439 suspected cases
of cholera, 189 of them reported over a 5-day period (24-28 Oct
2007). The latest reports from the camps indicate that the cholera
situation appears to be stabilizing as the number of new suspected
cases is slightly dropping.

North Kivu province is facing the worst internal displacement since
the end of the civil war in 2004. Some 375 000 Congolese have been
forced to leave their homes in the North Kivu province since last
December 2006 due to continued fighting between government forces,
renegade troops, and rebels. More than 160 000 were newly displaced
just over the past 2 months.

An outbreak of cholera has swept a camp housing Uganda's rebel Lord's
Resistance Army (LRA), infecting its leader Joseph Kony, his deputy
Vincent Otti, and scores of fighters, a spokesman said Fri 9 Nov
2007. The outbreak, caused by recent flooding and poor sanitation in
the Sudan-Democratic Republic of Congo frontier hideout, was 1st
reported in September 2007, but details of fatalities remain unclear.

Scores of LRA fighters were seen Thursday [8 Nov 2007] buying
medicine in the border outpost of Nabanga, according to a top
official from the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM), which
governs the semi-autonomous region of southern Sudan.

There were no reports of fatalities.
