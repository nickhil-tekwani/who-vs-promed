Subject: 2bposted - Mycobacterium bovis, badgers - UK

[Some background to what is clearly a complicately and possibly confused
situation. The eradication of bovine tuberculosis is normally
straightforward and relatively uncomplicated. In the early 1970s TB had
been removed from large areas of the UK. Final eradication was confidently
predicted. There were a couple of areas, in west Cornwall and
Gloustershire, where persistently infected herds were known and coexisted
with infected badgers. Thanks to the 1981 Wildlife and Countryside Act the
numbers of badgers increased significantly. In the face of rapidly
increasing numbers of TB infected herds the Government set up an inquiry
under the chairmanship of Professor Krebs in July 1996; Krebs started his
review in November. As might be expected his final report was delayed. When
submitted in December 1997 it said that although there was general evidence
to support the dangers to cattle of a badger TB reservoir it was not
supported by rigorous scientific proof. The committee suggested ways it
which this could be achieved. Unfortunately, since December there had been
silence from MAFF as to what exactly they intend to do and when. There was
increasing criticism from the UK National Farmers Union as well as from
individual farmers with newly identified TB reactor cows and in limbo as to
what could be done, other than the compulsory slaughter of their reactor
cows at unwelcome compensatory levels. The UK Government issued the
following press report on Monday, 17th August. I have inserted the web
addresses for the documents quoted. - Mod.MHJ]

SCIENTIFIC STUDY WILL INVESTIGATE TB IN CATTLE
A scientific study to investigate the link between tuberculosis in cattle
and badgers was given the go-ahead by the Government today. Details of the
study have been set out in the report of the Independent Scientific Group
on Cattle TB chaired by Professor John Bourne - Towards a Sustainable
Policy to Control TB in Cattle, published today.
The report presented Ministers with a difficult decision, caught between
the need to prevent the disease affecting cattle, and protecting wild
badgers. There has been a continuing debate between farming and badger
groups over the issue. The Government has listened to all sides. It now
intends to put policy on a scientific footing - which has not happened in
the past.
Government policy is based on two main principles: putting public health
first, and giving full weight to a commitment to animal welfare. Snares
will not be used in the trial and there will be a closed season on trapping
badgers.
Food Safety Minister Jeff Rooker said:
"This has been one of the most difficult decisions facing Ministers at
MAFF. We sympathise with the views expressed by badger groups. Badgers are
a protected species, and will remain so. Our policy objective is not to
eradicate badgers, but to control TB in cattle. We cannot ignore the clear
advice from both Professor Krebs and Professor Bourne - that 'the sum of
evidence strongly supports the view that, in Britain, badgers are a
significant source of infection in cattle'.
"We have a potentially serious problem affecting cattle in this country.
Bovine tuberculosis is a nasty disease in cattle and it is a serious
welfare issue. We must prevent widespread disease in cattle herds that are
used for milk and meat to feed human beings. We need to tackle the problem
now, before it becomes unmanageable. For this reason, we need to find out,
with certainty, the conditions in which controlling badgers in an area is
effective in reducing TB in cattle.
"Scientists are also working on developing a vaccine for both badgers and
cattle. However, a vaccine may take 10-15 years to develop. In the meantime
we must explore every opportunity to see how the disease can be prevented
in cattle."
The Government has set out a five-point strategy to tackle the problem:
1: to minimise the risks to humans and investigate potential links with
human health; new arrangements are being set up with the Department of
Health to track human cases; 2: for the long term, to carry out research
leading to development of a cattle vaccine, as recommended by the Krebs
Committee - this may be a 10-15 year programme;
3: to understand better how infection is transmitted - this is also built
into the Government's research plans;
4: to prevent spread from cattle to cattle - routine cattle testing,
slaughter of reactors and movement restrictions have this as their aim and
the Government is looking to see if it can strengthen them to stop the
spread of the disease in the short term;
5: to carry out the badger culling trial recommended by the Krebs and
Bourne Committees in order to find out when culling is an effective
approach and when it is not.
The trial will start this year in six of the recommended 30 areas, each of
about 100 square kilometres. These are the areas where tuberculosis in
cattle is running at the highest levels and where it is also commonly found
in badgers.
Professor Bourne's Committee has consulted badger groups and taken account
of their concerns. The Committee has recommended against the use of snares
to catch badgers. There will also be a closed season from 1 February to 30
April each year in which trapping will not take place, in order to minimise
the risk of leaving cubs underground.
Internal and external audit procedures will be put in place to monitor
procedures, efficiency and data quality and completeness.
After 25 years of protection, the badger population is not at risk. During
the whole of the trial, trapping will only take place over 2,000 square
kilometres - an area little more than half the size of Cornwall. Badgers
will not be culled outside the trial areas, nor in one third of the trial
areas, since they will be used as controls.
Because cattle will be more exposed to infection from wildlife the
Government has decided that compensation for reactors should be increased
from 75% to 100% of market value. An Order will be brought forward to allow
this to happen as soon as possible. In the comprehensive spending review an
extra BPS 6 million a year has been allocated to spending on tuberculosis
in cattle.
Notes for Editors
1. Copies of the report of the Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB
can be obtained from: MAFF Publications, Admail 6000, SW1A 2XX. (Quote

3. The Krebs Report on Bovine Tuberculosis in Cattle and Badgers was
published on 16 December last year,
http://www.maff.gov.uk/animalh/tb/krebs/krebssum.htm
together with the Government's preliminary response.
http://www.maff.gov.uk/animalh/tb/krebs/response.htm
Comments were invited on how to take its recommendations forward. When the
formal consultation period ended on 27 February the Government had received
over 300 responses, and has continued to receive a number of letters since
then. All responses have been considered carefully before deciding the way
forward. The individual responses are available for inspection in MAFF's
library.
4. Tuberculosis is a serious disease in cattle, and although fewer than a
half of one per cent of the country's herds are affected, its incidence is
rising.
NEW CONFIRMED TB INCIDENTS IN CATTLE
1995 1996 1997 1998 Jan-Jun(1)
West Region (2) 316 329 413 262
Wales 104 102 62 46
GB 449 471 515 334
(1) Figures for 1998 are for those TB incidents (breakdowns) where disease
had been confirmed by 30 June 1998. Confirmation of disease, where culture
is necessary, often takes 6-8 weeks.
(2) West Region consists of the counties of Cornwall, Devon, Somerset,
Dorset, Gloucestershire, Avon, Wiltshire, Herefordshire, Worcestershire and
Shropshire.
5. The first six areas, three on the borders of Devon and Cornwall, and
three on the borders of Gloucestershire and Hereford and Worcestershire,
have been shown on the map attached. [not available]
6. The consultation showed unanimous agreement on the need to ensure bovine
tuberculosis does not become a threat to public health. Pasteurising milk
and a rigorous system of meat inspection ensure that tuberculosis does not
spread into the food chain. However, the risks of infection by other routes
could rise if the disease becomes widespread on farms. MAFF will continue
to test all herds regularly, and is considering whether to strengthen
current arrangements. MAFF will work closely with the Department of Health
to monitor tuberculosis in humans, and improve understanding of the very
small percentage of cases which are caused by bovine tuberculosis.
7. On 20 April MAFF published in PDF format an Animal Health and Welfare
Research Requirements Document, in which proposals were invited from
research institutes for a new programme on tuberculosis starting in
1999-2000.
