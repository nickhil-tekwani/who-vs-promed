Summary:
We report the 1st detection of Seoul virus (SEOV) in humans in Europe, causing severe disease in a pregnant woman in France in October 2012. The patient's laboratory test results mimicked that of pregnancy-induced liver pathologies such as acute fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP) with severe renal failure. This led to an emergency delivery (at 27 weeks' gestation). On the basis of gene S (small) sequence analysis, the Seoul hantavirus strain detected was found to belong to the main SEOV phylogroup.

Discussion:
To the best of our knowledge, that is the 1st report of SEOV infection in a pregnant woman, although we suppose such cases of infection may have been suspected or detected in Asia. The clinical and biological picture of our case was confusing because distinguishing between this SEOV infection and certain liver pathologies of pregnancy, especially severe pre-eclampsia with haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome and AFLP was problematic. Such syndromes have been suspected in pregnant women infected with hantaviruses. In women with elevated levels of liver enzymes, thrombocytopenia and renal failure during pregnancy without hypertension, especially when laboratory test results are atypical and the symptoms begin with fever, practitioners should consider possible hantavirus infection instead of pregnancy-induced pathologies, which could potentially avoid emergency delivery and thus newborn prematurity.

As in the rest of Europe, data regarding SEOV in France are very scarce. The virus was detected in 2003 in reared brown rats in Lyon (about 60 km south of the patient's home), one human case was serologically confirmed (by neutralisation assay) and others suspected. Routine serological tests do not allow discrimination between SEOV and PUUV [Puumala virus] infections and the demand for hantavirus testing in France, especially for mild cases, is limited because these tests are not free of charge. Therefore, the occurrence of SEOV infections in humans is probably underestimated. Large studies focusing on the epidemiology of SEOV infection should be conducted in France as well in the rest of Europe, as serologically confirmed cases have been recently described in the United Kingdom.

[It is difficult to know whether this is a unique case or whether there have been others. Given the number of SEOV infections around the world and over the years, surely there have been other infections in pregnant women. It is good to have this case report on record. As the above report indicates, most reported hantavirus infections are due to Puumala virus and occur in the northeastern area of France.
