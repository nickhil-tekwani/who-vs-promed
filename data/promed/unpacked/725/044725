Strain of _Clostridium difficile_ produces high levels of toxins A and B
--------------------------------------------------
The emergence of a highly toxigenic strain of _Clostridium difficile_
may be responsible for an outbreak of disease at the Centre
Hospitalier Universitaire de Sherbrooke (CHUS) in Quebec, Canada,
according to the results of a study to be presented tomorrow at the
15th annual scientific meeting of the Society for Healthcare
Epidemiology of America (SHEA) in Los Angeles, CA, USA.
According to an SHEA news release, the toxic strain is identical to
that which caused outbreaks in 7 hospitals across 6 USA states from
2001 to 2004. Data presented in 2004 at the Infectious Diseases
Society of America meeting suggest that the bacterium is resistant to
fluoroquinolone therapy.
The study was initiated to identify the emergent strain related to
the quadrupled incidence of _C. difficile_-associated diarrhea and
almost doubled case-fatality ratio observed at CHUS during the period
from 1991 to 2003, as reported in an earlier study by Jacques Pepin,
MD.
"The perception of a number of physicians is that the strain they are
dealing with is more virulent than usual," Michel Warny, MD, PhD,
lead investigator and director of bacterial process development for
Acambis Inc, told Medscape. "This is illustrated by the substantial
increase in mortality per case of _C. difficile_ infection since the
year 2000."
In the study, a single identical strain (toxinotype III) was
identified in 82 percent of isolates collected from patients involved
in the CHUS outbreak.
"There's always a dominant strain involved in outbreaks," Dr. Warny
noted. "This finding was significant because in general the
toxinotype III strain is found in only 2 percent of isolates."
Further, the toxinotype III strain was found to produce 16 times more
toxin A and 20 times more toxin B in vitro compared with 13
variations of the toxinotype 0 strain commonly found in 80 percent of
isolates (P less than .0001 for both comparisons).
"The main pathogenic factor of _C. difficile_ is the production of
these 2 toxins," said Dr. Warny, suggesting that the ability of the
emerging strain to produce up to 20 times more toxin than more common
strains may explain reports of its virulence in patients.
Genetic analysis of the type III strain revealed deletion of tcdC, a
gene believed to be a negative regulator of toxin production that is
normally expressed during the log phase of replication. Toxin
production during the log phase rather than the stationary phase was
consistent with this finding.
"These are in vitro data and further studies are needed to confirm
whether these toxinotype III isolates are indeed more pathogenic than
the rest," Dr. Warny said. "If this strain is responsible for
increased mortality rates, it could become important to identify it
for aggressive treatment in patients diagnosed with _C. difficile_
within a geographic area where the strain was found before."
