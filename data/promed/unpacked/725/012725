villages of Lapino in the Babyninskiy district, Pavlischev bor in the
Juhnovskiy district, and Kudrinskaya in the Meshchovskiy district.

of the Ministry of Emergency Situations in the Kaluga region.

Quarantine has been declared in one of areas of [the city of]
Blagoveshchensk, within private buildings. [For the location of
Blagoveshchensk, adjacent to the border with China, see map at
<http://map.rin.ru/maps_e/Amurskaya.gif>. - Mod.AS]
Experts of the city's station for animal disease control have
discovered NCD-infected birds -- including chickens, ducks, and
turkeys -- in one of the backyard farms. Avians in neighbouring
dwellings have been culled and the premises disinfected. During the
quarantine period imposed upon the relevant city-district, the trade
in susceptible birds, such as hens, guinea fowls, and turkeys, will
be forbidden.
George Ivanchikov, the chief of the Blagoveschensk station for animal
disease control, has informed that final disinfection of the relevant
territory should be completed by Saturday [28 April]. If all actions
are accomplished as planned, the quarantine might be terminated at
the end of the next week [Sat 5 May 2007].

[The Kaluga region is located in the Central area of Russia southwest
of Moscow. It borders with the Moscow, the Tula, the Oryol, the
Bryansk, and the Smolensk regions.
The Amur region is located in the southern part of the Russian Far
East. Blagoveschensk city is the administrative center of the region.
The region borders with China in the south (the total length of the
state border is more than 1200 kilometers); the Chita region in the
West; the Republic of Sakha Yakutia in the North; and the Khabarovsk
Territory in the East. - Mod.NP
Kaluga oblast (region) is No. 6 and Amur oblast is No. 43 in the
administrative map of Russia, available at
<http://www.grida.no/graphics/CEE/russia/russieoblast.jpg>. The
distance between the 2 regions exceeds 5000 km. (3100 miles)
The 2 events might be a reminder of the presence of the NCD virus in
Russia; unfortunately, the last available information on the NCD
situation in Russia, on OIE's (World Animal Health Organization)
web-site, dates back to 2004 (a total of 12 outbreaks, in the
following 6 regions: Ivanovskaya oblast, Altayskiy kray, Moskva
(gorod), Nizhegorodskaya oblast, Smolenskaya oblast, and Bryanskaya
oblast. This demonstrates the wide geographical distribution of the
disease. (See OIE's HandiSTATUS at
<http://www.oie.int/hs2/zi_pays_mald.asp?c_pays=162&c_mald=17>)
Official confirmation of the outbreaks described above, including
laboratory test results pertaining to the pathogenicity of the NCD
virus involved, and a detailed update on the NCD situation in Russia,
are anticipated. - Mod.AS]
