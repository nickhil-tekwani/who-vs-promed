Health officials have confirmed a new case of _E. coli_ O157 in an
outbreak that has claimed the life of a woman and left 3 people in hospital.
The 81-year-old woman is stable and being treated at the Royal
Alexandra Hospital in Paisley. She had eaten cold cooked meats bought
from the delicatessen counter of one of the 2 Morrisons stores
involved in the outbreak. Investigations are continuing to pinpoint
the source of the bug, which health officials suspect came from cold
cooked meats sold in the supermarkets.
There have so far been 9 confirmed cases in the outbreak, which has
been linked to stores at Lonend and Falside Road in Paisley.
A 66-year-old woman died on Mon 13 Aug 2007, after contracting the
illness. Her 72-year-old husband is serious but stable at Glasgow's
Victoria Infirmary and a 70-year-old Paisley woman remains stable in
hospital in the Republic of Ireland.
A 71-year-old woman being treated at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in
Paisley has been cleared for discharge, but due to family
circumstances she has not yet left the hospital, and an 86-year-old
woman and a family of 3 are recovering at home.
Health officials said it was encouraging that none of the new cases
had fallen ill from meat bought since the alarm was raised.
Dr Syed Ahmed, chair of the Outbreak Control Team, said: "This latest
case dates back to the consumption of cold cooked meat from one of
the 2 deli counters involved prior to action being taken by Morrisons
to halt the distribution of deli meat from these stores. From a
public health point of view it is encouraging that all confirmed
cases so far consumed deli meat before the outbreak was identified on
13 Aug 2007."
The Outbreak Control Team are currently carrying out a wide-ranging
investigation, which involves interviewing suppliers and analysing
samples taken from the stores. They are also investigating a number
of other confirmed _E. coli_ O157 cases in Scotland and England to
establish if there is a link to the Paisley outbreak. So far none of
these cases have been linked to the outbreak.

[Since the previous posting (ProMED-mail 20070815.2655), 2 more cases
have been reported. It is important to note that, as stated in this
report, no new cases have been identified since the initial alert a
week ago (14 Aug 2007). If none of the other cases outside the area
can be linked to the Paisley outbreak, this strongly suggests a local
issue such as cross-contamination occurred. - Mod.LL]
