Feds work to confirm that 4 people were sickened by botulism poisoning
---------------------------------------------------
Slowly and carefully, a federal lab is trying to confirm whether it was
botulism poisoning that virtually paralyzed 4 people who received
anti-wrinkle injections at an Oakland Park, FL, clinic. Even though the
confirmation is widely expected, the test results have been held up several
times as researchers continue testing blood samples for the toxin from the
botulinum bacteria, which causes botulism, officials said on Mon 6 Dec 2004.
"They have to be careful to get everything right," said Christine Pearson,
a spokeswoman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
which is conducting the tests. The 4 were admitted to hospital just after
Thanksgiving, a few days after getting the wrinkle shots at Advanced
Integrated Medical Center. All remain in critical but stable condition,
breathing with help from machines.
Dr Andres Suarez, an infectious disease specialist who treated one of the
couples, said the CDC lab has confirmed their cases as being botulism, but
county and federal health officials said the final tests are still
incomplete. Labs confirm botulism by injecting mice with blood or fluid
from the victim. If the mouse is paralyzed and dies within 24 hours, it's
botulism, according to reports by researchers. [Reversal of the paralysis
by administered botulinum antitoxin confirms the diagnosis. - Mod.LL]
State and federal officials investigating the cases have focused on
unapproved, Botox-like injections as the source of the poisoning. They have
found in the clinic paperwork an Arizona company that sells such a product.
They have not determined whether that company's product was used in the
injections. Also, sources close to the investigation have said they are
investigating whether clinic personnel, including one of the victims, gave
the shots.

[Using single fiber electromyography, local injections of recommended
dosages of toxin have been found to have measurable effects in muscles
distant from the treatment (1). Although these measurable effects do not
generally have clinical manifestations, generalized muscular weakness and
even respiratory arrest have been reported with usual doses (2-4).
