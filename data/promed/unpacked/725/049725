The district office has ordered the cull of birds on a holding in the city of Roding (District Cham/Bavaria) as a precaution after laboratory testing gave an indication of the presence of Avian influenza. Further testing at the regional lab and the National Reference lab (FLI) gave results which led to declare a 'suspect outbreak'.

The type of influenza will be determined through further testing by the FLI.

On Fri 4 Dec 2015, the regional authorities ordered a complete quarantine of the affected holding. As the virus is easily transmitted to other animals, no animals [of any species] or their products can be moved off the holding. Movement of humans is restricted as well.

According to legislation (Gefluegelpestverordnung) even suspicion of infection requires the complete destruction of all poultry/birds on the farm.

On the affected holding, approx. 12 900 birds are kept (laying hens, ducks, geese and turkeys). The district veterinary office has already arranged for the culling of the birds on Friday, in close cooperation with the owner. The Government of Upper Palatinate, the Bavarian State Ministry for Environment and Consumer Protection and the State Office for Health and Food Safety are involved.

A specialized company has started today the slaughter of animals, applying strict hygienic measures and in compliance with animal protection regulations. The killed birds will be sent to a rendering plant for safe disposal. After the completion of the action extensive cleaning and disinfection will take place. The district council Cham reminds that avian influenza is a notifiable animal disease.

The control measures are implemented to prevent the spread of the virus to other animals. The health department at the District Office Cham stresses that the population in general is not at risk from avian influenza. This also applies to the consumption of poultry meat and eggs. More information, especially on issues relating to the safety of food for human consumption, can be found on the websites

In addition, the District Office has established a citizen phone helpline. It can be contacted at the telephone number 09971 / 78-450, today, 6 Dec 2015, till 6 p.m. and on Monday 7 Dec during regular office hours.

Poultry farmers in areas unaffected by AI can help preventing the spread of disease by implementing biosecurity measures, with special attention to the early testing of animals with unspecific diseases or dead poultry. In case of suspicion they are requested to notify the competent veterinary authorities immediately. The district office Cham is asking all residents and the media to stay away from the area concerned, in order not to obstruct control measures.

[From the above information, in particular the urgent application of measures during the weekend, it may be guessed that highly pathogenic avian influenza, H5 or H7, is suspected but this, as well as the serotype involved, remain to be established and published.

Germany has experienced an outbreak caused by HPAI H7N7 in July 2015 (layer flock, Lower Saxony) and earlier, between early Nov 2014 and late Jan 2015, an epizootic caused by HPAI H5N8, involving 8 outbreaks, 5 of which were in poultry holdings and 3 cases in wild birds (see links and map at http://tinyurl.com/jybjsl2). This event was declared "resolved" on 5 Mar 2015.

Tests showed that the mentioned HPAI H5N8 virus strain was similar to that identified in 2014 in Netherlands and Britain. The same strain had devastated poultry flocks in South Korea earlier in 2014. South Korea had to slaughter millions of farm birds to try to contain the outbreak. Details on recent surveillance in wild birds in Germany and other north European countries will be helpful. - Mod.AS
