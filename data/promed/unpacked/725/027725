A court has found 3 women in Australia died within a month of receiving transplanted organs from the same donor after the man passed on a rare mouse-borne virus. A colonial inquiry into the deaths of a 44-year-old woman, a 63-year-old woman, and a 64-year-old woman has prompted calls to improve communication between hospitals and medical staff. The 3 women received the organs from the same donor, a 57-year-old man, but all died within 6 days of each other -- and within a month of the transplantations.

The organ donor died from a stroke 12 days after returning to Melbourne following a 3-month stay with relatives in Serbia in 2006. The inquest heard he contracted lymphocytic choriomeningitis, an infectious virus [disease] spread by house mice, during his stay in Serbia, though he did not die as a consequence of it. However, the coroner, Audrey Jamieson, found the 3 women developed complications within days of their transplants in 2007 and all died of the virus.

The inquest heard that the donor's family was not asked about his health issues by doctors before donating his organs. The link between the 4 deaths was discovered after an autopsy on the 63-year-old woman's body. The virus had not been detected in Victoria previously. Ms Jamieson said the deaths were tragic but not foreseeable and ruled the screening process for organ transplants was reasonable. However, she called for improved communication between medical staff, hospitals and patient families.

"The discovery of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis-]like virus [LCMV-like] virus occurred some months after the deaths of the 3 recipients," Ms Jamieson said. "Until that discovery I accept that it was a strain of virus that was unknown in humans and thus not capable of being identified at the time of organ retrieval and transplantation by those involved... The LCMV-like virus is a novel arenavirus -- not previously seen or seen since, in Victoria." Ms Jamieson added that she did not want to deter people from donating organs because Australia has a low donation rate.

The partner of the 44-year-old woman said she accepted the recommendations, saying the outcome of the transplants was "unforeseeable". "I think the risks are fairly small of this ever happening again and the upside of the whole transplant program is totally beneficial," she said. "I can only still thank the donor's family for making a difficult decision at the time their father and husband died."

[In fact, LCMV infection as result of organ transplantation from an infected donor is not unknown. On 3 May 2005, the US CDC received a report of severe illness in 4 patients who had received solid organ transplants from a common donor. All 4 organ recipients subsequently were found to have evidence of infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), a rodent-borne Old World arenavirus. Preliminary findings from the ensuing investigation indicate the source of infection likely was an infected hamster in the donor's home [see MMWR Weekly, 26 May 2005. 54(Dispatch); 1-2 http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm54d526a1.htm]. Even at the time of the organ transplantation in Australia the transplant surgeons should have been aware of the hazard and carried out appropriate screening. The coroner's statement is inaccurate in this respect. Health-care providers should be aware that LCMV can be transmitted through organ transplantation. Any unexpected infectious syndromes in recipients after solid organ or tissue transplantation should trigger concern about the possibility of transplant-associated transmission of an infectious agent.

LCMV infection usually is either asymptomatic or causes mild self-limited illness in otherwise healthy persons. LCMV can cause aseptic meningitis, but the infection is rarely fatal. Infection during pregnancy can result in vertical transmission of the virus from mother to fetus; LCMV infection during the 1st or 2nd trimesters can lead to severe illness in the fetus. Serologic studies conducted in urban areas of the United States have indicated that prevalence of LCMV infection among humans is approximately 5 percent. The house mouse (_Mus musculus_) is the primary reservoir for LCMV, with a prevalence of infection of 3 percent to 40 percent [in the USA]; a high degree of focality often is noted. However, other types of rodents (such as pet hamsters or guinea pigs) can be infected after contact with infected house mice; these rodents also have been implicated in human infection. Animals can become ill or can be asymptomatic. Infection in humans occurs primarily through exposure to secretions or excretions of infected animals.

Human-to-human transmission of LCMV has not been reported, with the exception of vertical transmission from an infected mother to fetus. A large outbreak associated with pet hamsters sold by a single distributor was reported in 1975, when 181 symptomatic cases among persons with hamster contact were identified; no deaths occurred. In 2003, a cluster of solid organ transplant-associated meningoencephalitis deaths in Wisconsin was investigated and determined to be associated with LCMV infection. In that investigation, testing of donor tissues did not reveal any evidence of infection, and no exposures to rodents were found. Acute LCMV infection in an organ donor is thought to be a rare event.
