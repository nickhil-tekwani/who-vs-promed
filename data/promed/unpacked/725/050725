[Follow up on PACNET posting 21.04.98 Here are the details on what appears
to be an imported case of dengue in Saipan, CNMI. Serology information on
a related possible second case is still pending (at our level). If found
positive, this would eventually
confirm local (in-house) transmission, via _Aedes albopictus_. Thanks to
Dr. Jon Brus, Medical Director, for his summary. - YS

............
We have had our first case of confirmed dengue fever here in the CNMI. The
patient was a government employee who recently returned from Kiribati. The
patient had fever, myalgia, and intense headaches upon arrival to the CNMI.
These symptoms continued for 2 days when the patient departed for another
conference in the United States. There the patient reported the onset of a
hemorrhagic rash, hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, and epistaxis. She did not
seek medical attention in the US. Luckily she had a complete recovery.
Both her IgM and IgG for anti-dengue antibodies were positive.
After she departed to the US her son, living in the same household also
developed fever, myalgias, and headache. He did not develop any symptoms
consistent with hemorrhagic fever. Serology is pending.
We do have a vector here in the CNMI, _Aedes albopictus_. Fortunately we
do not have _Aedes agypti_. It is also the dry season when our mosquito
population is diminished. I am hoping that we will not have an outbreak on
our hands. I have alerted the physicians here at CHC and will begin
initiating press releases.
...............
[Is anyone having some news from Kiribati? How's the outbreak being
handled? - YS

[In situations such as this, it is appropriate for the laboratory that made
the diagnosis to notify the authorities in the U.S. where the (possibly
viremic) patient had attended the meeting. There may be no cause for
concern if it was not "mosquito season" in that place but that
determination is the responsibility of the local health authorities in the
U.S. - Mod.CHC
