[Classical swine fever (CSF) is a highly contagious and economically significant viral disease of pigs. The severity of this disease varies with the strain of the virus, the age of the pig, and the immune status of the herd. Acute infections, which are caused by highly virulent isolates and have a high mortality rate, are likely to be diagnosed rapidly. However, infections with less virulent isolates can be more difficult to recognize, particularly in older pigs. These infections may be relatively mild, and can resemble septicemias caused by other agents, as well as other diseases. In some herds, the only symptom may be poor reproductive performance or the failure of some pigs to thrive. The wide range of clinical signs and similarity to other diseases can make classical swine fever challenging to diagnose.

Classical swine fever virus (CSFV), a member of the genus Pestivirus and family Flaviviridae. Only one CSFV serotype has been found, but minor antigenic variability has been demonstrated between viral strains. This virus is closely related to the ruminant pestiviruses that cause bovine virus diarrhea and border disease.

Classical swine fever is highly contagious. Infected pigs are the only reservoir of virus. Blood, secretions and excretions (including oronasal and lacrimal secretions, urine, feces and semen) and tissues contain infectious virus. Virus shedding can begin before the onset of clinical signs, and occurs throughout the course of acute or subclinical disease. Chronically or persistently infected pigs can shed virus continuously or intermittently for months.

Transmission between pigs occurs mainly by the oral or oronasal routes, via direct or indirect contact. CSFV is often spread by feeding uncooked contaminated garbage. Animals can also be infected through the mucus membranes, conjunctiva and skin abrasions. CSFV can be spread by genital transmission or artificial insemination. Infected carrier sows may give birth to persistently infected pigs. The virus can also be spread on fomites, and mechanical spread by insects, birds and other wild or domesticated animals may occur. Airborne transmission seems to be possible over short distances; however, the maximum distance the virus can spread is unclear. While aerosol transmission occurred only within a radius of 250 meters in one study, transmission could occur up to 1 km in another.

The incubation period can range from 2 to 15 days, depending on the virulence of the strain, the route of inoculation and the dose. Under field conditions, disease may not become evident in a herd for 2 to 4 weeks or longer.

The signs of classical swine fever vary with the strain of virus, and the age and susceptibility of the pigs. More virulent strains cause acute disease; less virulent strains can result in a high percentage of chronic, mild or asymptomatic infections. Although highly virulent strains were once more prevalent, most epizootics are now caused by moderately virulent strains. Older animals are less likely to show severe symptoms than younger pigs. Some breed-specific differences have also been reported.

Acute swine fever is the most severe form of the disease. In this form, common symptoms include a high fever, huddling, weakness, drowsiness, anorexia, conjunctivitis, and constipation followed by diarrhea. Pigs may be incoordinated or exhibit an unsteady, weaving or staggering gait, which progresses to posterior paresis. Some pigs may vomit yellow, bile-containing fluid, or develop respiratory signs. The abdomen, inner thighs, ears and tail may develop a purple cyanotic discoloration. Hemorrhages can also occur in the skin. Severe leukopenia usually occurs soon after disease onset, and convulsions may be seen in the terminal stages. Pigs with acute classical swine fever often die within 1-3 weeks.

Subacute disease can be caused moderately virulent strains of CSFV. It may also occur in older pigs. The subacute form is similar to acute classical swine fever; however, the symptoms are less severe, and the fever may persist for 2-3 weeks. Some pigs with subacute classical swine fever may survive; others die within a month.

Chronic disease tends to be seen with less virulent strains or in partially immune herds. In the initial stages, chronic disease can resemble acute or subacute disease, with anorexia, depression, elevated temperatures, leukopenia, and periods of constipation or diarrhea. Affected pigs usually improve after several weeks; however, after a period where they appear relatively normal, they develop recurrent symptoms that may include intermittent fever, anorexia, periods of constipation or diarrhea, wasting or stunted growth, alopecia and skin lesions. Immunosuppression may lead to concurrent infections. The symptoms of chronic infections can wax and wane for weeks to months, and may affect only a few animals in the herd. Affected pigs may survive for one to three months, but chronic infections are always fatal.

In some breeding herds infected with less virulent strains, poor reproductive performance may be the only sign of disease. Sows may abort or give birth to stillborn, mummified, malformed, weak or dead piglets. Some piglets may be born with a congenital tremor or congenital malformations of the visceral organs and central nervous system. Other piglets may be asymptomatic at birth, but persistently infected. These animals are persistently viremic and become clinically ill after several months (“late onset” disease). The symptoms can include inappetence and depression, as well as stunted growth, dermatitis, diarrhea, conjunctivitis, ataxia or posterior paresis. Although affected pigs usually survive for more than six months, all typically die within a year. Congenital infections may be limited to a few piglets in the herd.

Classical swine fever can be diagnosed by detecting the virus, its antigens or nucleic acids in whole blood or tissue samples. Viral antigens are detected by direct immunofluorescence (FAT or FATST test) or enzyme–linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). The virus can also be isolated in several cell lines including PK–15 cells; it is identified by direct immunofluorescence or immunoperoxidase staining. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) tests are used in some laboratories.

The ruminant pestiviruses that cause bovine virus diarrhea and border disease can occasionally infect pigs. Serum neutralization tests, or immunoperoxidase procedures that use monoclonal antibodies, can differentiate CSFV from these viruses. They can also be distinguished using genetic methods such as RT-PCR.

Serology is used for diagnosis and surveillance. Antibodies develop after 2 to 3 weeks, and persist lifelong. For this reason, serology is most useful in herds thought to have been infected 30 or more days previously. It is particularly helpful in herds infected with less virulent strains, where viral antigens may be more difficult to find. The most commonly used tests are virus neutralization tests, which include the fluorescent antibody virus neutralization (FAVN) test and the neutralizing peroxidase–linked assay (NPLA), and various ELISAs. Antibodies against ruminant pestiviruses may be found in breeding animals; only tests that use monoclonal antibodies can differentiate between these viruses and CSFV. The definitive test for differentiation is the comparative neutralization test. Congenitally infected pigs are immunotolerant and are negative on serology.

Companion ELISAs have been developed for marker vaccines, but have limitations in their sensitivity and/or specificity.

Quarantines, movement bans and good surveillance are important in controlling outbreaks. Strict biosecurity on a farm can reduce the risk of infection. During an outbreak, confirmed cases and contact animals may be slaughtered. Although CSFV can be spread over long distances by animal transportation and other forms of dissemination, farms within a 500 meter radius of an infected farm have a particularly high risk of infection. Culling of all pigs in an area may be practiced, due to this ‘neighborhood effect.’ Infected premises are thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. Vaccination may be used as a tool to assist in controlling an outbreak and eradicating the disease. In countries free of classical swine fever, periodic serologic sampling is necessary to monitor for the potential reintroduction of disease.

Belize Threatened By Classical Swine Fever
------------------------------------------
The Belize Agricultural Health Authority (BAHA) and the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries have today issue an alert informing the general public that neighboring Guatemala is experiencing a massive outbreak of Classical Swine Fever Disease in pigs. The disease has affected almost the entire country of Guatemala which has led to the disposal of more than 7000 pigs.

This disease however, only affects pigs and Belize is considered free of this disease. BAHA in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture is presently implementing emergency measures to prevent its introduction and spread.

The BAHA alert says that these measures include: public awareness, movement control, 24 hours inspection at the Western Border with Melchor De Mencos in Guatemala, active surveillance in high risk areas, improved bio-security at farms, prohibition of the importation of live pigs and pork products from Guatemala and the cleaning and disinfection of trucks used for transporting livestock to [& presumably from, which is more important. - Mod.JW]Guatemala.

The public has been advised not to feed table scraps containing meat to pigs. Pig farmers have been asked not to feed meat and other waste from slaughtering plants to their pigs and not to allow dirty trucks into their farms.

The authorities have asked the public to notify any BAHA or Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries office of any unusual health problems in pigs.

Belize has every reason to be concerned about Guatamala having this disease. It is very contagious and seems to move when least expected. Because the pigs can shed the virus prior to presenting with clinical signs, I would want to know if any pigs were imported in the last couple of weeks. Putting those animals under quarantine may be a preventative measure worth taking for a couple of weeks.

Belize may be found on the interactive Healthmap at: http://healthmap.org/r/1AYt?
Guatemala may be found on the interactive Healthmap at: http://healthmap.org/r/1Ifb - Mod.TG]

[Obviously, the Animal Health Authorities in Guatemala and Belize don't have the same view of the situation. Can anyone provide ProMED-mail with a definitive update about the current status of the outbreak? There is a current OIE report referencing OIE Updates claiming no new outbreaks since mid December, 2011 -- see OIE WAHID website Updates referenced above. - Mod.PC]
