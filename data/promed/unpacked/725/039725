Discovery sheds light on flu infections
--------------------------------
Scientists have discovered a new gene in influenza virus that helps the virus control the body's response to infection. Although this control is exerted by the virus, surprisingly it reduces the impact of the infection. The findings will help researchers better understand how flu can cause severe infections, as well as inform research into new treatments.

Just finding this gene in the first place is important, but the find is even more significant because of the role it seems to play in the body's response to flu. Researchers found when the virus gene -- called PA-X -- was active, mice infected with flu subsequently recovered. When the PA-X gene did not work properly, the immune system was found to overreact. This made the infection worse, and did not help destroy the virus any quicker.

The study looked at how the gene affected the behaviour of "Spanish flu", a virulent strain of influenza that caused a pandemic in 1918. It was carried out by the Universities of Cambridge, Cork, Edinburgh and Utah, the Institute of Systems Biology in Seattle and the United States National Institutes of Health. Scientists discovered the PA-X gene some 30 years after the flu genome was first decoded. The researchers, whose study is published online in the journal Science [see below], found the hidden gene by analysing patterns of changes in the genetic information of thousands of different flu strains.

The flu virus has a very, very small genome - just 12 genes. Professor Paul Digard, of The Roslin Institute at the University of Edinburgh said: "Just finding a new gene is a pretty significant change to our understanding of this virus. Dr Andrew Firth, of the University of Cambridge, said: "The flu virus has a very, very small genome - just 12 genes. Finding a new gene makes a pretty significant change to our understanding of this virus."

The research was funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, the Medical Research Council, the U. S. National Institutes of Health, Science Foundation Ireland, and the Wellcome Trust.

An Overlapping Protein-Coding Region in Influenza A Virus Segment 3 Modulates the Host Response
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
By B.W. Jagger and 16 others

Abstract
--------
Influenza A virus (IAV) infection leads to variable and imperfectly understood pathogenicity. We report that segment 3 of the virus contains a second open reading frame ("X-ORF"), accessed via ribosomal frame shifting (FS). The FS product, termed PA-X, comprises the endonuclease domain of the viral PA protein with a C-terminal domain encoded by the X-ORF and functions to repress cellular gene expression. PA-X also modulates influenza virus virulence in a mouse infection model, acting to decrease pathogenicity. Loss of PA-X expression leads to changes in the kinetics of the global host response, which notably includes increases in inflammatory, apoptotic, and T-lymphocyte signaling pathways. Thus, we have identified a previously unknown influenza virus protein that modulates the host response to infection, a finding with important implications for understanding influenza virus pathogenesis.

Scientists discover influenza A virus's 13th gene
----------------------------------------
An international group of scientists has discovered a new gene in the influenza A virus that may play a role in controlling the body's response to infection, according to a study in Science [Abstract reproduced in part (2) above]. Previously, scientists believed the flu virus contained only 12 genes. The protein of the new gene, called PA-X, [encoded] in the third of the virus's eight RNA strands, is produced when the ribosome (the part of the virus that translates RNA into amino acids) skips ahead while reading messenger RNA (mRNA) nucleotide chains. The ribosome reads the nucleotides in groups of three, so if it skips forward one nucleotide, it will read the nucleotides in different combinations and produce PA-X. The researchers -- from the Universities of Cambridge, Cork, Edinburgh and Utah, the Institute of Systems Biology in Seattle, and the US National Institutes of Health --- then studied how the newfound gene affects the behavior of the 1918 pandemic H1N1 flu virus. They found that when PA-X was active, mice infected with the virus subsequently recovered, but when it did not work properly, the immune system overreacted and made the infection worse. They report that PA-X inhibits the expression of RNA polymerase II, which is responsible for translating DNA into mRNA. Paul Digard, PhD, of The Roslin Institute at the University of Edinburgh, said in a university press release, "Just finding this gene in the first place is important, but the find is even more significant because of the role it seems to play in the body's response to flu." Digard doesn't appear to be done discovering new flu genes. "I'm working on a manuscript today that describes another one," he told Discover magazine (see: http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2012/06/28/new-flu-gene-found-hiding-in-plain-sight-and-affects-severity-of-infections/).

[The genome of the influenza A virus (a negative strand RNA virus classified in the family _Orthomyxoviridae_) consists of 8 single-stranded negative sense RNA molecules spanning approximately 13.5 kilobases (kb). The segments range in length from 890 to 2341 nucleotides and thought to encode a total of 12 proteins.

The analysis described above identifies a 13th protein (PA-X) translated from an RNA generated from segment 3 (PA-encoding) by ribosomal frame-shifting. This genome product comprises the endonuclease domain of the viral PA protein with a C-terminal domain encoded by the X-ORF reading frame. This new gene product designated PA-X interacts with the host's (laboratory mouse) immune response system in a manner as yet undefined which effectively aids survival. It is being suggested that it cuts up bits of RNA from the virus's host, stopping it from activating its own genes. This process, known as host-cell shut-off, is a win-win strategy for the virus. It stops the host from mounting an effective defence against the virus, and it means that the host is more likely to manufacture proteins using the virus's genetic instructions, rather than its own destroyed RNA. An outcome likely to be beneficial to survival of both virus and host. - Mod.CP]
