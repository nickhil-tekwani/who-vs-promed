The Heybridge Basin near Maldon in Essex is one of the most scenic parts of our coast, but now some residents say public safety is being put at risk by millions of poisonous caterpillars lining the pathways. The brown tailed moth caterpillar has thousands of barbed hairs which, if you come into contact with [them], can cause serious health problems.

"It's got to be addressed now otherwise it will snowball into a massive problem. It's the hairs on the caterpillars that will get blown off on the wind and they will be carried on the wind for miles so not just people standing here would be affected, somebody a mile away could pick up a hair from this very bush." [a resident said].

In some cases the poisonous barbed hairs on the caterpillars can cause severe allergic reactions. Sometimes people who come into close contact with the nests or the caterpillars can get some rashes which can be very uncomfortable. But there are things that people can do. Look out for those silken tents in hedgerows and avoid them. Don't pick up hairy caterpillars is always a sensible bit of advice.

Concerned residents will inspect the area and will be taking action to address the infestation and erect warning signs.

[The brown tail moth (_Euproctis chrysorrhoea_) is found throughout Europe. Its larva [caterpillar] is covered by urticating hairs, which provides protection. Stinging with these hairs causes skin reactions requiring medical treatment. Strong winds and any disturbance may cause hairs to become airborne.
