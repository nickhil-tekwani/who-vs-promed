The Lake County Health Department has tied a severe illness that has
infected as many as 20 people to a worker at a Waukegan restaurant.
Employees are washing their hands every half hour at the restaurant as part
of new cleanliness procedures in place since one employee was diagnosed
with shigellosis, what used to be called dysentery.
Health officials say the restaurantÂ’s food is not contaminated and there is
no risk to the public. But county health officials are worried he could
have spread the bacteria to others before he was diagnosed on 28 Jun 2000.
Lake County Health Department executive director Dala Galassie says the
department has identified 20 cases, 10 of which are confirmed. He fears
dozens more could have been infected and have not come forward.

Eleven people told Lake County health officials Thursday that they became
ill after eating at the Waukegan restaurant believed to be the source of a
dysentery outbreak that has sickened about 20 others.
The latest group said they had eaten at the restaurant June 29 and 30, and
became ill afterward, said Leslie Piotrowski, spokeswoman for the Lake
County Health Department. Those were the same days on which others who got
sick said they had eaten at the restaurant.
So far, two people who have gotten the disease have had to be hospitalized.
They have been treated and released, health officials said. Two other
victims are seniors, who are more likely to become severely dehydrated by
the disease's diarrhea, and another is a 7-year-old child, who did not have
to be hospitalized.

[This is a classical case of an outbreak initiated by an infected food
handler. The second article (not posted in its entirety) made additional
reference to a strain of _Shigella_ "more common in Mexico" and the
restaurant is indeed a Mexican restaurant. However the authors failed to
include the microbiological characterization of the isolate. There is also
no information on the Illinois Dept. of Health website. Further
information would be appreciated. - Mod.ES]
