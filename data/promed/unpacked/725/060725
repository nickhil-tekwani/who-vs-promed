[1] Johnson & Johnson vaccine booster
Date: Fri 15 Oct 2021

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) vaccine advisory group today [15 Oct 2021] unanimously approved a booster dose of Johnson & Johnson (J&J) vaccine for all Americans 18 years old and older who received a single dose. Also today, the experts discussed mix-and-match dosing, raising several questions and airing multiple issues, but they took no vote on the issue.

Today's vote by the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) -- affirming that data support the safety and effectiveness of the J&J booster dose -- was unanimous and followed the group's unanimous nod for Moderna boosters yesterday [14 Oct 2021] for high-risk groups.

The group's decision is nonbinding, and FDA officials will make the final decision, paving the way for Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) vaccine advisors to hold their recommendation discussions, slated for next week. In February [2021], the FDA granted the J&J vaccine emergency use authorization (EUA) as a single-dose product.

Unlike the booster recommendation for the 2 mRNA vaccines (Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech), which targets those at highest risk, today's booster recommendation includes anyone who got the J&J vaccine. The booster should be given at least 2 months after the primary, or initial dose. About 14 million doses of the vaccine have been given in the United States.

Earlier this month [October 2021], the company applied to the FDA to amend its EUA, based on data it provided showing that a booster increases effectiveness to 94%. At one dose, the vaccine is 71% protective, according to the CDC, which is high, but not as high as for the mRNA vaccines.

Before today's meeting, the FDA's scientists released a briefing document indicating that a benefit for J&J boosters looked promising, but they said the data were limited (https://www.fda.gov/media/153037/download).

During today's discussions, VRBPAC members said the vaccine should be considered a 2-dose product, which got pushback from the company. Many experts consider the one-dose primary series as one of the vaccine's strengths, which makes it easier to deliver, especially in hard-to-reach populations.

After the vote, VRBPAC members discussed data from recent findings on mixed doses from a National Institutes of Health (NIH) preprint study, which found a benefit for all booster combinations, but that Johnson & Johnson recipients had a stronger immune response after getting an mRNA booster (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.10.21264827v1.full.pdf).

Michael Kurilla, MD, PhD, who directs the Division of Clinical Innovation at the NIH, wondered if it would be worth parsing out each vaccine combination and that the focus should be full approval for each of the vaccines.

Experts also worried that moving forward with mix-and-match actions would confuse the public and pose messaging challenges. Archana Chatterjee, MD, PhD, dean of Chicago Medical School at Rosalind Franklin University, said the topic is well worth exploring, especially for certain groups such as those who had allergic reactions to their initial COVID-19 shot. She added that mix-and-match issue raises a host of questions, such as what would happen with children's immune responses and how long the immune boost would last.

[2] India (Delhi): delta outbreak
Date: Fri 15 Oct 2021

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/10/covid-19-scan-oct-15-2021


Delhi's COVID-19 outbreak this past spring [2021] -- the city's 4th since the pandemic began -- showed the delta variant's high transmissibility and higher ability to infect the previously infected, researchers say in a study published yesterday [14 Oct 2021] in Science (https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj9932).

The researchers used genomic and epidemiological data taken from Delhi from November 2020 to June 2021. During the 2020 outbreaks, they found that there were no variants of concern, and the alpha variant was seen occasionally and usually in foreign travelers until January 2021. In March 2021, the alpha variant surged to comprise about 40% of the cases, but delta rapidly displaced its dominance in April [2021]. A Bayesian model indicated that the delta variant was 30% to 70% more transmissible than the other COVID-19 lineages seen in Delhi thus far. And, importantly, prior COVID-19 infection provided 50% to 90% of protection against delta compared with previous lineages.

To see how well the mathematical model held up against reality, the researchers then looked at a cohort recruited by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, India, which ranged from 832 to 1012 people across 3 time periods. From February to July [2021], the unvaccinated people who were positive for antibodies against COVID-19 went from 42% to 87.5%. Among 91 people who had COVID-19 before the delta outbreak, 27.5% had increased levels of antibodies, indicating reinfection. Also, regarding breakthrough infections, a single center showed that of 24 cases, delta was 7 times more likely to be the cause.

"The concept of herd immunity is critical in ending outbreaks, but the situation in Delhi shows that infection with previous coronavirus variants will be insufficient for reaching herd immunity against delta," said co-author Ravi Gupta, PhD, MPH, BMBCh, in a University of Cambridge press release (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/931488). "The only way of ending or preventing outbreaks of delta is either by infection with this variant or by using vaccine boosters that raise antibody levels high enough to overcome delta's ability to evade neutralisation."

"Dr. Anurag Agrawal from the National Centre of Disease Control and the CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, India, senior author and co-lead investigator, said: 'This work helps understand the global outbreaks of delta, including in highly vaccinated populations, because the delta variant can transmit through vaccinated or previously infected people to find those who are susceptible.'" - Mod.LK]

Today [15 Oct 2021], the White House announced that fully vaccinated foreign nationals can travel freely in and out of the United States beginning 8 Nov 2021. Foreign air travelers entering the United States will need to prove vaccination and have a negative COVID-19 test before boarding a flight to the country, the Washington Post reports. Foreign travelers entering through land borders need only proof of vaccination.

The existing travel bans have been in place since March 2020, when President Donald Trump's administration barred most non-US citizens from the United Kingdom, Europe, Brazil, and South Africa from entering the country.

Airline and tourism executives applauded the decision to lift the ban. "We welcome the Biden administration's science-based approach to begin lifting the restrictions on travel to the US that were put into place at the start of the pandemic," American's CEO Doug Parker said in a statement (https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/15/us-to-lift-travel-ban-on-nov-8-allowing-vaccinated-international-visitors-into-the-country.html).

As many as half of Chicago's police officers could be put on leave in the coming days for not meeting the city's COVID-19 vaccine mandate, CNN reports. The officers had a deadline of midnight Thursday [14 Oct 2021] to disclose their vaccination status or be placed on unpaid leave (https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/14/us/chicago-police-vaccine/index.html). Mayor Lori Lightfoot has mandated the vaccines.

Yesterday, a new nationwide analysis showed that 62% of police deaths last year [2020] were related to COVID-19; at least 228 officers have died from the virus so far this year [2021].

In related news, the US Navy said yesterday [14 Oct 2021] that it is preparing to discharge sailors who refuse vaccination for COVID-19 as mandated by the Pentagon, according to Fox News. 14 Nov 2021 is the deadline for active-duty sailors to get vaccinated (https://www.foxnews.com/us/us-navy-kick-out-sailors-who-refuse-covid-vax).

And finally, the Texas Supreme Court temporarily halted a San Antonio school district's vaccine mandate for teachers and school employees yesterday [14 Oct 2021], just hours before it was set to take effect, the Texas Tribune reports (https://www.texastribune.org/2021/10/14/texas-supreme-court-school-vaccine-mandate/).

All employees of San Antonio Independent School District were supposed to be vaccinated by today [15 Oct 2021] -- a move that directly challenged Gov. Greg Abbott's ban on vaccine mandates. Texas State Attorney General Ken Paxton has sued the school district.

The Johns Hopkins University tracker shows that the United States reported 83 756 new COVID-19 cases yesterday [14 Oct 2021] and 2005 deaths (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html).

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) COVID Data Tracker shows that 56.8% of Americans are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, and 65.8% have received at least one dose of vaccine (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total).

A total of 5.2% of fully vaccinated people have received a booster dose, the CDC said. That number is expected to grow as early as the 1st week of November [2021], when Americans who received the Johnson & Johnson or Moderna vaccines will be eligible for booster shots.

Global COVID-19 developments
----------------------------
- Russia today [15 Oct 2021] reported record daily highs for both cases and deaths -- 32 196 and 999, respectively, according to Reuters. The Kremlin blames slow vaccination campaigns (https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-russia-cases/russias-daily-covid-19-deaths-new-cases-hit-record-highs-idUSR4N2QQ01W).

- South Korea said today [15 Oct 2021] it will revise some of its strict measures next week as the country shifts into "living with COVID," Reuters reports. The expectation is that 80% of the population will be fully vaccinated when the economy reopens in November [2021] (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-southkorea/s-korea-eases-coronavirus-gathering-curbs-before-switch-to-living-with-covid-idUSKBN2H509G).

- President Joe Biden announced yesterday [14 Oct 2021] that the United States will send 17 million Johnson & Johnson doses to the African Union, according to the Washington Post (https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/10/14/covid-delta-variant-live-updates/%23link-FBSMOKFAAZB45JZXRWPVRIERI4/).

- The United Kingdom has suspended a private lab over false-negative COVID-19 test results. Investigators estimate that 43 000 people were given incorrect results from 8 Sep to 12 Oct 2021 (https://www.gov.uk/government/news/testing-at-private-lab-suspended-following-nhs-test-and-trace-investigation).

- The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control published a report today [15 Oct 2021] on promoting vaccine acceptance based on the 5Cs model: confidence, constraints, complacency, calculation, and collective responsibility (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/covid-19-increase-vaccination-acceptance-and-uptake).

- The global total is 239 918 710 COVID-19 cases, including 4 886 816 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins tracker (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html).

Pakistan on Friday [15 Oct 2021] reported 1086 new cases of COVID-19 in the last 24 hours, bringing the total number of active cases below the 40 000 mark for the 1st time since the 4th wave of the pandemic started in July [2021]. The country last reported fewer than 40 000 cases on [13 Jul 2021] at 39 644 cases.

According to the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC), Pakistan's total number of cases after the latest additions climbed to 1 262 771 while 28 deaths in the last 24 hours took the death toll to 28 228 in the country.

The NCOC said that the total number of active COVID-19 cases in Pakistan decreased by a little over 300 to 39 593. The positivity rate now stands at 2.02%. Meanwhile, at least 1415 people recovered from the virus in the last 24 hours, taking the tally of recoveries to 1 194 590.

COVID-19 infections are decreasing in Pakistan, with 909 new infections reported on average each day. That's 15% of the peak -- the highest daily average reported on 17 Jun 2021.

Pakistan has administered at least 93 551 193 doses of COVID vaccines so far. Assuming every person needs 2 doses, that's enough to have vaccinated about 21.6% of the country's population.

During the last week reported, Pakistan averaged about 918 586 doses administered each day. At that rate, it will take a further 48 days to administer enough doses for another 10% of the population.

The South Asian COVID-19 situation, according to data from Worldometer (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) as of 15 Oct 2021 at 07:07 GMT:

Country: Total cases / Total deaths / Deaths per million population
India: 34 037 592 / 451 847 / 323
Bangladesh: 1 564 485 / 27 737 / 166
Pakistan: 1 262 771 / 28 228 / 125
Nepal: 804 276 / 11 269 / 378
Sri Lanka: 529 755 / 13 429 / 624
Afghanistan: 155 682 / 7238 / 181
Maldives: 85 932 / 237 / 429
Bhutan: 2616 / 3 / 4

Over the last 7 days, 122 023, 3667, 6538, 3994, and 6205 COVID-19 cases were detected in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, respectively, compared with 148 862, 4907, 9695, 5221, and 6173 in the preceding 7 days, revealing the continuation of the decreasing trend of the disease in 4 of these South Asian countries. The disease trend in Sri Lanka, however, remained stable. The development of immunity in significant sections of these countries' populations due to natural infection and by vaccination could play role in seeing such sustained dropping of new cases in recent times.

Over 971.4 million COVID-19 vaccine doses have been administered in India so far (https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-covid-19-vaccination-coverage-exceeds-97-14-crore/articleshow/87037723.cms).

Bangladesh has a plan for vaccinating 80% of the population above the age of 18 years. So far, of the target population, 32% have received the 1st dose and 16% have received both the 1st and 2nd doses (http://103.247.238.92/webportal/pages/covid19-vaccination-update.php). The country has also decided to vaccinate school children below the age of 18, and a total of 112 students belonging to 4 government schools in Manikganj district in Dhaka division were reportedly vaccinated yesterday (Thu 14 Oct 2021) with Pfizer jabs as part of a test run (https://m.theindependentbd.com/post/269067).

As of 15 Oct 2021 at 6:17 AM, a total of 93 551 193 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered in Pakistan (https://ncoc.gov.pk/).

So far, Nepal has administered at least 14 852 777 doses of COVID-19 vaccine (https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/countries-and-territories/nepal/), and Sri Lanka has administered at least 27 285 321 doses of the vaccine. Assuming every person needs 2 doses, that number is enough to have vaccinated about 62.6% of the country's population (https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/countries-and-territories/sri-lanka/).
