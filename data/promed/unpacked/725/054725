[2] WHO interview: Dr Ian Norton

Mark Colvin: As chief of foreign medical teams with the World Health Organization, Dr Ian Norton will be contributing to ABC news coverage of the EVD [Ebola virus disease] crisis. He is racing against time to build 3 massive field hospitals in Monrovia [Liberia], and his goal is to get them ready in just 3 weeks. He spoke to me a short time ago....

Ian Norton: This is new for everybody. The only team that have ever done anything like a field hospital for EVD treatment before have been MSF, Medecins Sans Frontieres. And their standard operations are for 40 people. Now, here in Monrovia they've already constructed a 200-bed facility, the biggest in the world, and they're about to expand to 300 and then, perhaps, to 400. And we, the WHO, are building five 100-bed facilities. So even that alone is almost 3 times as much as anything that's ever been constructed prior to this particular outbreak.

MC: And what about the number of actual medical staff to look after people? Is that even remotely keeping up?

IN: Not at the moment. No. What we have here is a call to foreign medical teams across the world to come and assist. And we're not looking for huge numbers of foreign doctors and nurses and logistics but at least a core group of 30 to 40 who would help manage these large centres and then work alongside national medical staff and nursing. And EVD care is all about the nursing care.

MC: And are there enough nurses in the local area, or are you having to recruit nurses from around Africa and, indeed, around the world?

IN: Some of the countries affected have amongst the lowest rates of nursing and doctor ratios in the world. What's really tragic here in Liberia, where I am now, they were already 4th-last in the world ranking for numbers of doctors per population and they've lost almost 20 doctors. They only produce 10 doctors per year in a medical class.

MC: So they've lost 2 years' worth of doctors just in a few weeks to EVD?

IN: Correct. Also, there's only a couple of thousand nurses in the country and we know that at least 90 have died from the infection and another 50 or 60 have survived.... They've lost a lot of other ancillary healthcare worker staff. Tragically, we have 3 ambulance workers infected now, here in Monrovia. And so the impact on the healthcare workers is huge....

With better care, and certainly with the new EVD treatment centres and with the right number of staff treating them, we can gradually escalate care. And I'll give you examples that are coming out of Guinea for several months now. With good supportive care they can bring the mortality rate down to 30 to 50 per cent at most. So we can see a several-fold improvement in survival if we can just get the teams in here and we can just get these EVD treatment centres up and running ... [more]

I am still at a loss about calls for doctors from all over the world to come and assist in emergency medicine in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, whereas the West African postgraduate college (for Medicine) and other such institutions have not even released a piece to call on their fellows and members to come and assist.

Is respiratory protection appropriate in the Ebola response?
------------------------------------------------------------
Jose M Martin-Moreno, Gilberto Llinas, Juan Martinez Hernandez
Related to "Lives at risk under global Ebola guidelines -- experts"

We write to express our concern about one aspect of the response to the current epidemic of EVD that has, so far, received little attention, lacks an evidence base, and might be counterproductive.

The primary mode of transmission of ebolavirus is through contact with infected patients' secretions (such as blood, vomit, or faeces) directly and indirectly (for example, from contaminated needles). This transmission occurs via close family contact or in health-care settings, particularly when placing orotracheal intubation or when caring for a patient who is vomiting or bleeding. Ebolavirus is rarely transmitted via an airborne route. Although these routes of transmission are well known, most agencies, including governmental agencies responsible for repatriating western patients, apply infection-control measures appropriate for airborne diseases.

Excessive precautions could offer reassurance to those responding to EVD, yet complete respiratory protection is expensive, uncomfortable, and unaffordable for countries that are the most affected. Worse, such an approach suggests that the only defence is individual protective equipment, which is inaccessible to the general population. Moreover, the image of workers with spectacular protective clothing might contribute to the panic in some communities. If this leads people to flee affected areas it could increase the spread of infection. It also reinforces the view that some lives are more valuable than others, already engendered by decisions about the use of experimental EVD drug ZMapp.

We contend that the systematic application of precautionary measures that protect health-care personnel and others from direct contact (i.e., gloves and waterproof smocks, goggles, masks, and individual rooms or wards in the hospital) are sufficient to manage most patients (who do not experience haemorrhage or vomiting). In fact, goggles and masks might not even be necessary to speak with conscious patients, as long as a distance of 1-2 metres is maintained (the maximum distance that infectious droplets might reach)....

In western Africa now there is a need for rational and efficient use of protective equipment. This can only be achieved by communicating a consistent message that the disease is essentially transmitted through direct contact. In control of infectious diseases, more is not necessarily better and, very often, the simplest answer is the best.

The WHO recently voiced concern over the "unprecedented" number of healthcare workers hit by the [EVD] outbreak, with more than 120 workers dead and over 240 others infected....

In a co-authored editorial in the International Journal of Nursing Studies, Raina MacIntyre, a professor of Infectious Diseases Epidemiology at the University of New South Wales [Australia] said the recommendations for staff treating EVD patients to wear masks and goggles were not enough to curb the spread of infection. "I have conducted the world's largest randomised control trial of respirators and surgical masks, and it is concerning to me that we are dealing with a disease which has a fatality rate of up to 90 percent and yet we are not taking the most cautious approach," she said. "If our healthcare workers die we have no hope of controlling the outbreak. There has been no criticism of the guidelines but lots of commentary supporting them. But they're playing Russian roulette with frontline health workers' lives."

MacIntyre highlights that laboratory researchers working on the virus were required to wear full protective clothing, but goggles and face masks were deemed suitable for healthcare workers.... MacIntyre said the guidelines suggested scientists had one set of guidelines, while health workers had another. "It's like they have no concept of what the clinical setting is like," she said. "The hospital is an unpredictable, highly contaminated setting which poses higher risk of EVD transmission. Healthcare posts had to shut because people are scared to go to work. That's a really troubling thing, because of a lack of skilled healthcare workers in the 1st place."

3rd US EVD patient showing 'remarkable improvement'
---------------------------------------------------
11 Sep 2014: (Reuters) The 3rd American to be treated for EVD in the USA is showing "remarkable improvement" after receiving an infusion of plasma from US EVD survivor Dr. Kent Brantly, as well as an undisclosed experimental drug, his doctors said on Thursday [11 Sep 2014]. Dr. Rick Sacra, 51, who is being treated in a special biocontainment unit at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, received 2 doses of plasma from Brantly, which doctors are calling a convalescent serum, and has been given nightly doses of an undisclosed experimental drug, Dr. Phil Smith, one of Sacra's doctors, said in a news briefing. "I don't know how much of his recovery is due to the drug, how much is due to the convalescent serum and how much to the aggressive intravenous fluids," Smith said. Brantly's blood likely contains protective antibodies that may help buy Sacra some time while his body tries to fight off the infection, Smith said. The hospital tried a number of potential donors, but Brantly's blood type turned out to be a match for his friend and fellow missionary Sacra.

Liberia: Mary's Meals responds to EVD crisis
--------------------------------------------
12 Sep 2014: Mary's Meals is delivering food aid to thousands of people affected by the EVD outbreak in Liberia -- including patients infected by the deadly virus -- following the launch of a new emergency relief effort.

The Mary's Meals crisis response has already seen around 10 000 children receive emergency food rations in their homes and is focused on 2 counties, Grand Cape Mount and Bomi -- both of which have been cut off from the capital Monrovia by military blockade. The state of emergency declared by Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf has led to the establishment of quarantined zones and the restriction of people's movements. As a result, there have been widespread reports of soaring food prices, increased hunger and a general rise in food insecurity across the region ... [more]

[I am not seeing any discussion of the need to protect the whole face -- eyes, nose and mouth -- from touching by contaminated gloves, particularly when removing protective gear, when the urge to wipe away sweat or tears or scratch an itch may be overwhelming. Face shields should be preferred to scary masks and goggles, allowing patients to see the face of the health worker attending to them.

It is also important to note that incident investigators seem to be coming to the conclusion that the international staff who became infected were probably contaminated outside the hospitals and labs, perhaps at their hotels, where, although they may not have touched anyone, they may have contacted a contaminated surface or fomite.
