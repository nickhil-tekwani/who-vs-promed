Congo-Kinshasa: New strategies at work in 11th Ebola outbreak in DRC
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The 10th Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), which struck the eastern part of the country between 2018 and early 2020, went on to become the largest in the country's history. The 11th outbreak, currently underway in Équateur province, in the country's west, looks quite different: it progresses at a slow pace, producing small clusters in isolated areas and a lower overall mortality rate. How has the medical response evolved? How can we take advantage of the experience from previous outbreaks? Guyguy Manangama, who is leading Médecins Sans Frontières' (MSF) Ebola activities, describes the situation in this interview following a visit to Équateur province.

- What is the current status of the Ebola epidemic in Équateur province?
The 11th Ebola outbreak in DRC was declared on 1 Jun 2020. Since then, 130 people have fallen ill and 55 have died from the disease. The 1st cases were reported in the town of Mbandaka, Équateur's administrative centre, before small clusters began to appear in the more peripheral districts. Since then, the outbreak has been advancing at a slow pace. Although the situation appears to be under control, experience shows that new clusters can still occur.

At the same time, we are observing significantly lower levels of viral loads and mortality, compared to the 10th Ebola outbreak, which struck the east of the country between 2018 and 2020. Mortality is still high at 43% today, but it's down from the 67% we saw during the outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces.

A possible explanation is that some sort of natural immunity exists among people in Équateur province, as this region has experienced Ebola outbreaks before -- most recently in 2018. Reservoirs of the virus are traditionally present there. It is possible then that some people may have experienced low-level exposure to the virus before and may be immune in some way.

This is just a hypothesis based on observations: further analysis is needed to understand. Also, today we are benefitting from the scientific progress made in recent years, including our ability to use a vaccine, and curative treatments that have proven to be effective in clinical trials conducted during the previous outbreak in North Kivu.

- What are the main differences between the 10th and 11th outbreaks and how do they affect our activities?
The previous epidemic was exceptional in many ways, including that it took place in an area that had never seen the disease before and was a conflict area. The outbreak currently underway is quite different.

We don't see large urban clusters, but sporadic cases that don't appear to spread in a linear way; lacking major long-distance roads, for example, communities move along the meandering waterways of the area as they go from one small village to another. As a result, patients are scattered over a vast area that includes 12 of the 17 health districts in the province.

- What about the new tools developed during the last outbreak, including the 1st Ebola vaccine and new treatments that were provided as part of clinical trials? What role do they play in the response to the current outbreak?
The vaccine was used early on in the current outbreak and may have played an important role in reducing the spread of the virus. The strategy is based on vaccinating people who had direct or indirect contact with the sick, but in rural and sparsely populated areas it is often more expedient and effective to vaccinate the entire community. This would result in a de facto higher level of protection. After some delays, the new treatments have also been rolled out in treatment centres.

Today, these tools allow for a radical change in approach; while limiting the circulation of the Ebola virus remains a very important objective for the response, efforts are now increasingly focused on patient care and recovery.

Previously, we could do little more than isolate the sick and provide them with symptomatic treatments -- for example, for fever or dehydration. Having curative treatments at our disposal means that the patient and the quality of care can take centre stage.

More progress has come in the way of post-exposure prophylaxis; this includes administering monoclonal antibodies to people with a high probability of developing the disease, following high-risk exposure to the virus (say, through contact with a patient's blood), as long as it is done within 72 hours of exposure.

- One of the main challenges in North Kivu and Ituri was people's reaction to the arrival of the response teams. What is the relationship like with the community in Équateur province?

In northeastern DRC, we worked in an unstable context, marred by a very violent conflict that led to political tensions over long periods of time. In Équateur, the environment is much calmer.

The good relationship between healthcare personnel and local people can also be attributed to the new approach adopted by the response, which is based on empowering decentralised micro-structures for Ebola care in local healthcare facilities, close to patients and communities, relying on local health workers and limiting the use of large, centralised facilities, and imported personnel. In short, we support the local healthcare network to identify, isolate, and treat patients with Ebola disease, minimising the need for a parallel system.

We promoted this approach as early as in 2019 while tackling the previous outbreak in the east. It has now been adopted by all those involved in the medical response, including the Ministry of Health, and has many advantages. Large treatment centres are neither appreciated by communities nor easily accepted by patients and their families; they are hermetically sealed, impenetrable... they spark fear. The incomprehension and hostility the centres generated in 2018 and 2019 produced harsh reactions, sometimes very violent.

By having the option of being treated closer to home, in facilities that are known and accessible to their families, patients are much more willing to come forward in case of symptoms. If they are indeed infected with Ebola, early admission to care also increases their chances of recovery. When sending our mobile teams, we have also taken into account the broader health needs of people aside from Ebola; this has also greatly contributed to the good acceptance of our teams by communities.

This deadly virus is at last beginning to look like a very serious but treatable disease -- and even a preventable one to some extent through vaccination -- rather than a biological threat.

[The ability to learn from the previous outbreaks and revise protocol accordingly is commendable. The most important changes are a successful vaccine and anti-viral treatments now available. Another important change noted in the report above is the use of the decentralised micro-structures for Ebola care in local healthcare facilities, creating a much less intimidating and isolating experience for the patients. But if this 11th outbreak or a future one were to expand in an explosive manner, these healthcare units might not be sufficient for the number of patients that might need care. Of course, those numbers might never reach the levels seen in earlier outbreaks because of the effective vaccine. This would be a new reality for a once deadly disease. - Mod LK]

[2] Early evidence of antibody
Date: Wed 4 Nov 2020

Scientists found antibodies to Ebola virus in people up to a year before the 2018 Ebola virus disease outbreak began in the Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, or DRC. This suggests that either early cases may have been missed or that exposure occurs more commonly than previously thought, according to a study led by the University of California, Davis.

The study, published today [4 Nov 2020] in the journal One Health Outlook [see reference below], also documents the 1st detection of antibodies to Bombali ebolavirus in a person, showing that spillover of that virus from bats to humans has likely occurred. Scientists from the UC Davis One Health Institute and Columbia University discovered Bombali virus -- a 6th ebolavirus species -- in bats in Sierra Leone in 2018.

"This study highlights that, yes, these are lethal diseases, but there's a range of severity -- not everyone who is exposed dies," said lead author Tracey Goldstein, an associate director of the One Health Institute at the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine. "Spillover doesn't always cause lethal outbreaks. To prevent outbreaks, we need a better understanding of what's happening between them. If you really are trying to understand how a virus works, you need to study it at all times, not just during an outbreak."

Women at increased risk
-----------------------
For the study, scientists collected and tested biological samples from 272 people seeking care in the Rutshuru Health Zone of North Kivu Province over the year before the start of the outbreak that killed nearly 2300 people. Antibodies, which indicate past exposure to a virus, were found in 10 percent of patients.

Scientists also administered questionnaires to patients to collect demographic and behavioral information, and to better understand their interactions with domestic animals and wildlife.

While people of both sexes and all ages tested positive for antibodies, women had a significantly increased risk of exposure. This is consistent with other studies and may be due to the larger role women play in preparing food and caring for livestock and sick family members.

"These findings are important for those of us who live in eastern Congo because it shows that people may become exposed to Ebola virus without becoming ill," said Jean-Paul Kabemba Lukusa, the Gorilla Doctors' medical technologist who coordinated human surveillance for this study. "It helps reinforce the work we do to explain to people how important it is to limit direct contact with wild animals and to follow hygiene and safety best practices."

Moving forward
--------------
The study also demonstrates the need to address how humans come into contact with wildlife and the viruses they exchange.

Co-author Kirsten Gilardi directs the UC Davis Karen C Drayer Wildlife Health Center and the Gorilla Doctors program, which provides veterinary care to wild mountain and eastern lowland gorillas in Rwanda, Uganda, and DRC. As the region's country lead for the USAID PREDICT Project, Gorilla Doctors sampled both wildlife and humans for viruses that may be circulating among them.

"These findings suggest there are more spillover events than we realize," Gilardi said. "This may not happen once in a while and then the virus disappears. Preventing spillover means understanding and minimizing high-risk human-to-wildlife interactions."

Funding for the study was provided by the US Agency for International Development, or USAID, Emerging Pandemic Threats PREDICT Project.

Abstract
--------
Background
The 2nd largest Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak began in the Democratic Republic of Congo in July 2018 in North Kivu Province. Data suggest the outbreak is not epidemiologically linked to the 2018 outbreak in Equateur Province, and that independent introduction of Ebola virus (EBOV) into humans occurred. We tested for antibodies to ebolaviruses in febrile patients seeking care in North Kivu Province prior to the EVD outbreak.

Methods
Patients were enrolled between May 2017 and April 2018, before the declared start of the outbreak in eastern DRC. Questionnaires were administered to collect demographic and behavioural information to identify risk factors for exposure. Biological samples were evaluated for ebolavirus nucleic acid and for antibodies to ebolaviruses. Prevalence of exposure was calculated and demographic factors were evaluated for associations with ebolavirus serostatus.

Results
Samples were collected and tested from 272 people seeking care in the Rutshuru Health Zone in North Kivu Province. All patients were negative for filoviruses by PCR. Initial screening by indirect ELISA found that 30 people were reactive to EBOV-rGP. Results were supported by detection of ebolavirus reactive linear peptides using the Serochip platform. Differential screening of all reactive serum samples against the rGP of all six ebolaviruses and Marburg virus (MARV) showed that 29 people exhibited the strongest reactivity to EBOV and one to Bombali virus (BOMV), and western blotting confirmed results. Titers ranged from 1:100 to 1:12 800. Although both sexes and all ages tested positive for antibodies, women were significantly more likely to be positive and the majority of positives were in February 2018.

Conclusions
We provide the 1st documented evidence of exposure to Ebola virus in people in eastern DRC. We detected antibodies to EBOV in 10% of febrile patients seeking healthcare prior to the declaration of the 2018-2020 outbreak, suggesting early cases may have been missed or exposure occurred without associated illness. We also report the 1st known detection of antibodies to BOMV, previously detected in bats in West and East Africa, and show that human exposure to BOMV has occurred. Our data suggest human exposure to ebolaviruses may be more frequent and geographically widespread.
