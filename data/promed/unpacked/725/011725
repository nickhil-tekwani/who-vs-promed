The Western Cape Provincial Veterinary Services has reported a case of
Rift Valley fever [RVF] in the Great Brak River area. This is the 1st
report of this disease for 2011 and the 1st occurrence of the disease
since the large outbreak that occurred last year [2010]. Last year, 26
people and in excess of 8 500 animals, died from this disease.

The South African Veterinary Services is very concerned about a return
of the disease during the rainy season of 2011. The widespread
rainfall experienced during January 2011 could even trigger a further
occurrence of this disease. Farmers are strongly advised to ensure
that their animals are vaccinated and to be on the lookout for signs
of the disease.

[The recommendation to vaccinate is contrary to the "no vaccination"
policy indicated in South Africa's recent immediate notification on
RVF to the OIE (archived 20110119.0224). One or other of the 2
policies deserves to be officially confirmed. - Mod.AS]
