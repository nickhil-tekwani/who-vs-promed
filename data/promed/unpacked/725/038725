Authorities in Uzbekistan and neighboring Kyrgyzstan are investigating a rash of sheep deaths that they say appear to have been caused by a tainted vaccine.

Uzbek farmers and officials say thousands of sheep died in the Qashqadariyo, Samarkand, and Jizakh regions after allegedly receiving a tainted smallpox [sic: but see comment] vaccine.

Meanwhile, in Kyrgyzstan, authorities in the southern region of Jalal-Abad are probing the deaths of 1700 sheep, also following their vaccination for smallpox [sic].

Authorities have sealed off Jalal-Abad's Suzaq and Aksy districts to try and limit the vaccine or other cause from spreading.

Kyrgyz reports said preliminary investigations suggested the vaccine was brought from Uzbekistan and distributed in the region by a local veterinarian.

[The term "smallpox" should, most likely, read "sheep pox"; probably, a translation error. Most sheep pox vaccines are live attenuated vaccines. Internationally recognised requirements concerning the manufacture and testing (safety, efficacy, stability) of sheep and goat pox vaccines, as adopted by the World Assembly of Delegates of the OIE in May 2010, are included in chapter 2.7.14 of OIE's Terrestrial Manual and available at http://tinyurl.com/cxwsyl7 (go to article C. "Requirements for Vaccines").

More details on the event are necessary in order to explore its cause; particularly, disease signs, the time lapse between vaccination and the appearance of disease or death, and findings at necropsy. Since the cases are reported from separate, scattered locations, the vaccine itself and not its application (for example, contaminated injectors) is to be the suspect.

It remains to be seen if the event is related to the virus strain used (not attenuated?), to another contaminating pathogen, or to a non-viral component of the vaccine. In the past, the most common contaminant of live attenuated sheep vaccines, including sheep pox, were pestiviruses (such as border disease virus (BDV); however, BDV is not regarded as lethal).

The control of the manufacture of animal vaccines, their testing requirements, and their licensing and certification procedures, as well as the control of their application, has been subject to discussions and concern for years. A spectacular, early incident of vaccine contamination occurred in the 1930s following the use of formalin-inactivated sheep brain as a source for louping ill vaccine, which led to the transmission of scrapie to over 1000 Scottish sheep from one vaccine lot. The Taiwan 1997 outbreak of FMD was suspected to be connected with an attenuated live vaccine virus used in China. Recent events, where vaccines were suspected to cause disease in sheep or goats, have been addressed in ProMED-mail posts 20120702.1187650 and 20110616.1838.

Any additional information on the current remarkable event will be appreciated. - Mod.AS
