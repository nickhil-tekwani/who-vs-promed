MOSCOW, June 29 - Moscow on Monday recorded its second cholera case of the
year, ITAR-TASS reported, when the son of the first victim was found to
have the disease.
The first patient, a 65-year-old man, contracted the disease outside the
Russian capital, officials said last week, without giving details.
Health officials have been checking people who had contact with him since
he was exposed to the disease earlier this month.
Cholera, a water-borne bacterial disease, is extremely rare in Moscow.
