New outbreaks
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Kaepe crush, Okavango, Ngamiland, Maun [North-West
district]
Date of start of the outbreak: 4 Feb 2011
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: village
Affected animals
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 250 / 14 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: the outbreak is within a fenced subzone in
Ngamiland [North-West] district, an FMD vaccination zone. Livestock in
the area are farmed under a communal grazing system. Only cattle
showed clinical signs of FMD.

Outbreak statistics (rates are percentages)
Species / Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate /
Apparent case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Cattle / 5.60 / 0 / 0 / 0
* Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction,
and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or
inconclusive.

Epidemiological comments: an ox was found with necrotic interdigital
lesions on all 4 feet without any oral lesions on postmortem
inspection at a local abattoir located in Ngamiland, zone 2d, an FMD
vaccination zone. Other 9 animals originating from the crush showed no
similar post-mortem findings. On trace-back to the crush of origin, 14
more cattle were found with oral and feet lesions from 15 to 22 Feb
2011. Zone 2 is sub-divided into 4 subzones; which are 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d,
from north to south. The affected area was scheduled for routine
vaccination in February 2011, but due to heavy rains the vaccination
campaign was postponed. Animal and animal products movement protocol
before the reoccurrence of FMD did not allow movement of cloven-hoofed
animals and their derived fresh products out of the zone. Therefore,
the reoccurrence of FMD in zone 2d does not affect the FMD free status
in other zones.

Control measures
Measures applied: quarantine; movement control inside the country;
zoning; vaccination in response to the outbreak(s); disinfection of
infected premises/establishment(s); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Botswana Vaccine Institute (OIE's reference
laboratory)
Tests and results:
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Cattle / virus isolation / 7 Mar 2011 / Positive
Cattle / virus sequencing / Pending

[An outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is reported in a disease
control zone where vaccination is practised. Ngamiland, the North-West
district of Botswana is located north of the Kalahari Desert, it
includes the Okavango marshes and Lake.

The report bears important information on the usefulness of a
traceability system that managed to identify additional cases and thus
timely put interventions in place. According to WAHID data FMD has
been regularly reported in Botswana since 2005 as either confirmed
infection and or clinical infection limited to certain zones.

The location of the current outbreaks can be seen on the map included
in the OIE report at the source URL above. A map showing the districts
of Botswana can be seen at
<http://www.maplibrary.org/stacks/Africa/Botswana/index.php> and the
HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of the country at
<http://healthmap.org/r/0zvE>. - Mod.NM

The outbreak in Botswana is in the far north western part of the
country, while the South African outbreak is located in the far north
eastern corner of the country, near the Indian Ocean and next to
Swaziland. The outbreak in South Africa was found only by serology,
whereas the outbreak in Botswana did show clinical disease and is the
SAT2 serotype FMD virus. Thus, it is unlikely these events are
related. - Mod.PC]
