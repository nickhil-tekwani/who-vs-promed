The Guinean minister of health and public hygiene, Dr Remy Lamah, said the Guinean government launched on [Mon 12 May 2014] a vaccination campaign for 140 000 people in several prefectures located on the coasts of the Lower Guinea to prevent an epidemic of cholera. "Through our partners, we have found the necessary vaccines to succeed in this vaccination campaign to prevent the danger associated with the cholera epidemic that is sweeping already in the country," said Dr Lamah.

This national strategy of prevention aims to protect the people living on the Guinean coastline and the islands, victims each year of the cholera epidemic, which occurrence depends on the season of long rains. This vaccination campaign will be extended in other prefectures of the country where there is risk of spread of the epidemic of cholera and other diseases.

Since January 2014, Guinea has recorded 2 fatal cases of cholera in the sub-prefecture of Kamsar located more than 300 km [186 mi] north of Conakry, stated Dr Sakoba of the health ministry division of prevention and fight against cholera. In August 2013, the cholera epidemic claimed more than 60 lives among more than 2000 cases, according to statistics from the Ministry of Health.

[2] Cholera, amoebic dysentery - Philippines (Cotabato Province)

The Department of Health (DOH) said at the weekend [17-18 May 2014] that unhygienic practices, such as open defecation, could have helped trigger the rise in cholera cases in 5 barangays [the smallest administrative division in the Philippines] of Alamada, North Cotabato this month, May 2014. "From what we've gathered, the people there still practice open defecation, which creates some problems with sanitation and water supply in the area. The transmission of cholera is though the fecal-oral route," DOH spokesman Dr Lyndon Lee Suy explained to journalists.

The DOH recorded 1083 cases of "acute watery diarrhea" since 12 May 2014 mostly in barangay Dado. Others cases were in barangays Lower Dado, Pigkawaran, Rangayen, and Barangiran. There have been 8 deaths [now 9 - Mod.LL], so far, and 5 of them were children.

Dr Lee Suy said that, of the 1083 cases, the majority are tagged as amoebiasis. Of this figure, only 44 have undergone rectal swab examination and 4 of them tested positive for cholera. Reckoning from the emerging pattern of cases, Dr Lee Suy elaborated, the incident could be classified as a cholera event because "although there are more amoebiasis, but looking at the severity and at the poor outcome, we'd rather work on cholera. Because when you work on cholera, it's covering as well the aspect of amoebiasis," he added.

According to Lee Suy, the main sources of water in the affected communities are streams and deep well which could easily be contaminated by open defecation. "We are urging the communities there not to obtain their water from the streams for now; we are conducting the rationing of safe water using jerry cans. We are also asking the residents to boil their water if they don't want to avail of the water from our supplies," he said.

[Both cholera and amoebic dysentery, infections that spread through contaminated water, appear to be circulating. At least in their classical forms, cholera is the prototypic cause of acute watery diarrhea with rice water stools, little or no abdominal pain, and fever without blood or mucus in the diarrhea. On the other hand, amoebic dysentery causes fever, abdominal pain, and tenesmus (pain on passing the diarrhea) and the stools often have mucus and blood. Indeed, dysentery has been called the "bloody flux". - Mod.LL

[3] Cholera - Nepal (Central Region)

Two persons, including a child, have died of cholera in 2 villages in Rautahat district: a 13 year old girl of Chandranigahpur and a 55 year old of Mahadpur village have lost life.

Almost a month after the 1st cases of 'diarrhea outbreak' were reported in these 2 villages, National Public Health Laboratory confirmed the disease as cholera only last week [week of 12 May 2014]. "It's been a week since the government finally confirmed the outbreak of cholera in these villages," added local health assistant Govinda Timilsina. "But the government is yet to get serious about the deadly disease since it has not taken any step to promptly control the disease from spreading into an epidemic."

Though only 2 cholera-related deaths have been reported so far, more than 450 people in the villages are reported to have been affected by the deadly disease, according to Timilsina. After the sources of natural water dried up in the village, the girl drank water from some other untested ground water, according to the villagers. She started to suffer from diarrhea and dysentery since Sunday evening, 18 May 2014. As there were no health institutions in the village, she was rushed to Timilsina's pharmacy at 2 pm on that night. "She was quite dehydrated by that time they brought her to my pharmacy, and it was not possible to save her life," said Timilsina.

According to Dr Subash Chaudhary of the Rautahat District Hospital, stool test of 7 patients have already confirmed that the disease thought to be diarrhea was actually cholera. A team of senior doctors led by Dr Pranil Singh Pradhan had come to the district 3 weeks ago for testing of the sample. According to a local health assistant Govinda Timilsina, more and more people are contracting cholera every day over the past few weeks.

"Only on Sun 18 May 2014, over a dozen of people have been found affected by the disease," he said. "It is just spiraling out of control." He further said that 29 others are in critical condition and are being provided with saline drips. Similarly, auxiliary nurse midwife at Gaidatar Sub-Health Post Durga Devi Humagain said that dozens of patients have been brought to the health post just on Mon 19 May 2014. "We have sent few of the patients to Chandranigapur hospital for further treatment as their health condition deteriorated," she added.
