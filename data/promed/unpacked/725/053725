Cholera Hits Kasese
-------------------
A fresh cholera outbreak has hit some parts of the district as rains
increase, health officials have confirmed. In a press release, the district
councilor representing Maliba sub-county, Mr Saulo Maate, said 7 cases had
been reported in the past few days in his sub-county alone.
Maate said 5 cases were reported in Mubuku village and 2 others in
Nyakakindo village. Maate said all the 7 were admitted to Kilembe Mines
Hospital, where they are recovering steadily. He called for the
intervention of the district authorities before the situation runs out of
hand. The district disease surveillance officer, Mr Pedson Butala,
confirmed the outbreak when contacted on Sun 19 Sep 2004, but said there
were 2 cases.
Butala attributed the outbreak to poor sanitary conditions in affected
areas. He said there was need for more anti-cholera drugs, which he said
were in short supply in the district.

[2] Cholera - Sierra Leone
Date: Tue, 21 Sep 2004
From: Charles Chambers <cchambers@cdc.gov>

The latest update has some confusing numbers. In the update on Sierra Leone
it states that they have had 15 deaths in Freetown. In an IRIN New.org
article, dated 27 Aug 2004, it stated there were 40 deaths just in that
month.
<http://www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=3D42913&SelectRegion=3DWest_Africa&SelectCountry=3DSIERRA_LEONE>
"We have been cholera-free since 1999," Alhassan Seisay, the director of
disease prevention, said by telephone from Freetown. "But since 6 Aug 2004
authorities have recorded 374 cases of the disease and 40 deaths."

[3] Salmonellosis, ox roast - USA (NY)

Health department investigates apparent food poisoning
------------------------------------------------------
The Erie County Health Department is investigating some 80 cases of
apparent food poisoning, from the East Aurora Fire Company's annual Labor
Day ox roast. Officials suspect salmonella contamination in some of the
food served. There are about 15 confirmed salmonella cases so far.
Erie County Health Commissioner Dr Anthony Billittier said, "This is one of
those diseases that health care doesn't cure; they cure themselves, we just
try to make them feel better in the meantime." Most of the patients
complained of upset stomach and diarrhea.
The East Aurora fire chief says the health department inspects the food
before the ox roast each year.
[While it is indeed true that most cases of enteric non-typhoid
salmonellosis are self-limiting without specific therapy, significant
morbidity and mortality can occur in the elderly, infants, and in people
with impaired cellular immunity. It is not stated whether the ox meat
itself is felt to be the vehicle. Various food items were served, and an
epidemiological investigation would be needed to implicate a specific food.

[4] Salmonellosis, waterborne - USA (MT)

Water poisoning likely came from poultry pen
--------------------------------------------
A poultry pen is the likely source of drinking water contamination that
sickened at least 19 customers of a restaurant near St Ignatius and led to
its temporary closure, health officials say.
Dinnerbell Bakery and Banquets owner Glen Hochstetler said the Amish
restaurant with meals served family style will reopen when a new water
treatment system has state approval, perhaps early in Oct 2004. The
Dinnerbell closed in early Aug 2004. A new water system using chlorine will
ensure safe drinking water, said Eugene Pizzini, compliance officer for the
Montana Department of Environmental Quality.
At least 19 people experienced gastrointestinal problems severe enough for
them to seek medical attention, and were diagnosed with problems related to
salmonella bacteria, Pizzini said. Cases were reported as far away as Arizona.
Pizzini said an inspection revealed an illegally installed plumbing
connection that could have allowed backflow of water supplying a poultry
pen. The Dinnerbell had an ultraviolet light water treatment apparatus, and
it is possible failure of that system preceded the water contamination, he
said.
Regulators said that when the restaurant was being developed, an on-site
inspection of the plumbing system did not occur, but the engineering
drawings were reviewed. The link to the poultry pen was not in the drawings.
Hochstetler said the Dinnerbell was added to a farm plumbing system at the
time of the restaurant's construction a few years ago.
Pizzini anticipates no fines or other enforcement action. "We're not
looking to put anybody out of business," he said. "We want to make sure
that their water is meeting state standards."
[Although a poultry source for non-typhoid salmonellosis is certainly a
classic one, in this outbreak the bacteria spread through contaminated
water. - Mod.LL]
