A farmer and 16 cattle died after a "deadly dome of air" formed in a Wisconsin farm's manure holding tank. According to [local broadcaster] WAOW, a 29 year old farmer [MB], from Amherst, Wisconsin, died of gas poisoning on his family's farm after being overcome by fumes of either methane or sulfur oxide. Initially, 13 of the farm's cattle died as well, but 3 more followed, bringing the total to 16 cattle.

The 29 year old's father, [BB], co-owner of [B Farms], said the tragedy was the result of a "perfect storm" of unusual and unexpected weather conditions. When the tank was prepped to be pumped, warm upper air temperatures trapped the gases in a "deadly dome of air," which then poisoned [MB] and the cattle. [MB] was found dead when other workers arrived to begin hauling manure away from the tank.

The coroner says an investigation is under way in order to determine what caused [MB's] death. He says [MB] had performed the task of emptying the tank hundreds of times prior to the incident. "I know of 13 dead cows," Portage County coroner Scott Rifleman told WAOW, prior to the other 3 cows dying "There were others which were sick. I am unsure if any more died. The family is devastated, absolutely devastated."

Rifleman told [local broadcaster] WSAW that gas poisoning deaths typically occur in closed areas, making the incident even more surprising. The coroner said atmospheric pressure prevented the gases from dissipating.

Following the tragic accident, many are calling for tougher regulations to be placed on manure holding tanks in order to prevent a similar incident in the future. According to All That's News, The National Agriculture Safety Database says there should be proper ventilation where animals are stored and warning signs must be posted nearby. "In addition to adhering to proper construction and maintenance procedures for liquid manure storage facilities, owners should be encouraged to follow a few precautionary measures to protect both workers and livestock from harmful manure gases," the NASD writes.

[Most likely this incident was due to hydrogen sulfide gas.

"Hydrogen sulfide (also known as H2S, sewer gas, swamp gas, stink damp, and sour damp) is a colorless gas known for its pungent "rotten egg" odor at low concentrations. It is extremely flammable and highly toxic.

"Hydrogen sulfide is used or produced in a number of industries, such as oil and gas refining, mining, tanning, pulp and paper processing, and rayon manufacturing.

"Hydrogen sulfide also occurs naturally in sewers, manure pits, well water, oil and gas wells, and volcanoes. Because it is heavier than air, hydrogen sulfide can collect in low-lying and enclosed spaces, such as manholes, sewers, and underground telephone vaults. Its presence makes work in confined spaces potentially very dangerous.

"The health effects of hydrogen sulfide depend on how much H2S a worker breathes and for how long. However, many effects are seen even at low concentrations. Effects range from mild, headaches or eye irritation, to very serious, unconsciousness and death.

"Why is hydrogen sulfide so deadly?
- It is highly flammable and toxic, even at low concentrations;
- it is heavier than air and may travel along the ground;
- it can build up in low-lying areas, and in confined spaces (including enclosed, poorly ventilated areas, such as manure pits, sewers, manholes, and underground vaults);
- after a while at low or more quickly at high concentrations, you can no longer smell it to warn you it's there;
- it can quickly, almost immediately, overcome unprepared workers, including rescue workers."

Levels between 700-1000 parts per million (ppm) produce unconsciousness after 1-2 breaths while levels between 1000-2000 ppm produce almost instant death. Manure pits are extremely dangerous. Farm workers can be exposed when cleaning manure storage tanks or working in manure pits. The gas from the pits can kill nearby animals and/or people.

Hand held units for measuring hydrogen sulfide levels are available. These units should be available to farm workers, especially those cleaning a pit. Furthermore, they should be turned on and observed as one approaches the manure pit. For more information on the various levels of hydrogen sulfide gas, and its effect, please see https://www.osha.gov/hydrogen-sulfide/hazards.

The farm owner should consider employing the use of an air purified respirator, or even a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). All farm workers going near or working to clean a manure pit should have some or all of this equipment and be trained in how to use it.
