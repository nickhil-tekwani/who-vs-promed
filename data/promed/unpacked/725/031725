INFLUENZA, PANDEMIC: DISEASE ARCHAEOLOGY (5)
============================================
[see also archive.960530, archive.960604, archive.960607, archive.960612]
Bob Shope is correct in his reference to Dr. Thomas Francis, Jr. (or"Tommy"
as he was known to all). Dr. Francis was a charter member of the Armed
Forces Epidemiological Board, which was the overseeing parent of a number of
Commissions, of which the Commission on Influenza was one. I was a member of
that Commission during the 1950s and 1960s, and recall (but do not remember
the date) one meeting at which the potential of obtaining information on
influenza through examination of bodies long interred (post 1918-19 pandemic)
in a frozen state was discussed. The general concensus was skepticism that
anything could be learned from bodies exhumed from shallow graves in the
perma-frost of the Alaskan tundra. As it turned out, the inquiry proved
fruitless, presumably because the bodies were not buried deep enough to meet
preservation requirements.
I would suggest that to learn more about this incident interested parties
contact Dr. Theodore ("Ted") Woodward at the Department of
Medicine,University of Maryland Medical School, Baltimore,MD; he served as
President of the Board for the past many years and would thus be in a
position to lacate archived material on this episode. Failing that, a record
of the Alaskan Expedition might be obtained from
