Data from the national schistosomiasis program show decreasing prevalence
------------
Objective
To assess the impact of a decade of biennial mass administration of praziquantel on schistosomiasis in school-age children in Burkina Faso.

Methods
In 2013, in a national assessment based on 22 sentinel sites, 3514 school children aged 7-11 years were checked for _Schistosoma haematobium_ and _Schistosoma mansoni_ infection by the examination of urine and stool samples, respectively. We analysed the observed prevalence and intensity of infections and compared these with the relevant results of earlier surveys in Burkina Faso.

Findings
_S. haematobium_ was detected in 287/3514 school children (adjusted prevalence: 8.76 percent, range across sentinel sites: 0.0-56.3 percent; median: 2.5 percent). The prevalence of _S. haematobium_ infection was higher in the children from the Centre-Est, Est and Sahel regions than in those from Burkina Faso's other 8 regions with sentinel sites (P <0.001). The adjusted arithmetic mean intensity of _S. haematobium_ infection among all children was 6.0 eggs per 10 ml urine. Less than 1 percent of the children in 6 regions had heavy _S. haematobium_ infections -- i.e. at least 50 eggs per 10 ml urine -- but such infections were detected in 8.75 percent (28/320) and 11.56 percent (37/320) of the children from the Centre-Est and Sahel regions, respectively. _Schistosoma mansoni_ was detected in only 2 regions and 43 children -- i.e. 1 (0.31 percent) of the 320 from Centre-Sud and 42 (8.75 percent) of the 480 from Hauts Bassins.

Conclusion
By mass use of preventive chemotherapy, Burkina Faso may have eliminated schistosomiasis as a public health problem in 8 regions and controlled schistosome-related morbidity in another 3 regions.

[It is impressive that the schistosomiasis control program, SCP, has managed to reduce the prevalence in schoolchildren to 1 percent or less in 8 provinces. The national SCP was initiated in 2004, when baseline data found a point prevalence of 18.4-84.2 percent among all children investigated, depending on the study region. The results show that a determined effort using well-proven technologies -- biannual mass distribution of praziquantel 1st to children and from 2006 also to adults, effectively reduced the disease burden of schistosomiasis. - Mod EP
