Hundreds of people in 18 states have become sick from a salmonella outbreak linked to raw chicken products made at 3 California plants owned by Foster Farms, the USA Department of Agriculture said on Monday, 7 Oct 2013. "The outbreak is continuing," USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service said in a statement.

An estimated 278 illnesses, mostly in California, were caused by strains of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Heidelberg. The chicken products were distributed mostly to retail outlets in California, Oregon and Washington state, USDA said. The illnesses were linked to Foster Farms brand chicken through epidemiologic, laboratory and traceback investigations conducted by local, state and federal officials.

In a statement, Livingston, California-based Foster Farms said it was working with authorities to reduce the incidence of _S._ Heidelberg on raw chicken products. No recall is in effect, the privately owned company added.

The CDC is partnering with state health departments to monitor the outbreak while the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) continues its investigation, USDA said.

"In addition to collaborating with FSIS and CDC, the company has retained national experts in epidemiology and food safety technology to assess current practices and identify opportunities for further improvement," Foster Farms President Ron Foster said in a statement.

_S._. Heidelberg is the 3rd most common strain of the salmonella pathogen, which can result in foodborne illness if not destroyed by the heat of cooking.

FSIS is one of the arms of USDA that continues to work during the federal government shutdown, but with reduced staffing. Meat, poultry, and processed egg inspection activities have been maintained.

Raw products from the facilities bear one of the following numbers inside a USDA mark of inspection or elsewhere on the package: P6137, P6137A, or P7632.

The salmonella outbreak linked to raw chicken from California involves multiple antibiotic-resistant strains and has a very high hospitalization rate of 42 percent, a food safety advocate who was briefed by government officials said Tuesday [8 Oct 2013].

"There are 7 strains involved in this outbreak," and many of them are antibiotic resistant, said Caroline Smith DeWaal, the food safety director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest in Washington. DeWaal was briefed by Christopher Braden, director of the division of food-borne illness at the CDC. "The outbreak has a far higher hospitalization rate, double the normal rate for salmonella," DeWaal said.

In 18 states, 278 people have been sickened in the ongoing salmonella outbreak. It has been linked to chicken produced by Foster Farms at 3 California plants, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced Monday, 7 Oct 2013.

Most staffers at the CDC who would normally be providing information about the outbreak are on furlough. However, the CDC brought additional staff back to work to investigate the outbreak, Braden told DeWaal. There have been no deaths linked to the outbreak, according to the CDC.

Commonly used antimicrobial agents are not always effective against strains of salmonella such as this one, so stronger antibiotics must be used.

The USDA's public health alert named 3 facilities operated by Foster Farms as the likely source of raw chicken contaminated with salmonella. Most of the chicken has been sold in California, Oregon and Washington, and most of the illnesses have occurred in California, the USDA says.

No recall has been announced, and the agency's Food Safety and Inspection Service "is unable to link the illnesses to a specific product and a specific production period," the news release says. Consumers can identify products that came from the 3 plants by looking for these packaging codes: P6137, P6137A and P7632.

In its own news release, Foster Farms says it is working with USDA inspectors and the CDC to address the outbreak. The company's food safety chief, Robert O'Connor, says the USDA inspection process has not been affected by the federal government shutdown.

Foster Farms encouraged consumers to cook poultry to an internal temperature of 165 F [73.89 C] to kill disease-carrying pathogens. The USDA recommends that consumers use a food thermometer as the only way to ensure the proper temperature is reached.

Consumers shouldn't rely on cooking instructions that give a specific number of minutes of cooking for each side of chicken. The actual time may vary, depending on whether the chicken is broiled, fried or grilled and whether it was chilled or frozen when cooking began, according to the USDA.

An outbreak of the same strain of salmonella was linked to Foster Farms chicken in 2012 in Oregon and Washington. That outbreak sickened 134 people in 13 states, the CDC reported in July 2013.

In a statement on its website, Foster Farms said it has "instituted a number of additional food safety practices, processes and technology throughout company facilities that have already proven effective in controlling salmonella in its Pacific Northwest operations earlier in 2013."

To a certain extent, the CDC has been flying blind when it comes to food-borne illnesses for the past week because the government shutdown meant it had to close PulseNet. That's a national computer network that connects 87 public health laboratories and looks for trends and matches to spot food-borne illness outbreaks. It's one of the agency's most important tools in detecting this kind of problem. "They had been trying to work on this outbreak for a week, doing information exchange by phone and e-mail and found the volume of data was too large," DeWaal said.

The CDC finally was able to bring back 7 of the 8 employees who run PulseNet, and it was up and running as of Tuesday, 8 Oct 2013, Braden told DeWaal.

Salmonella is known to contaminate poultry flocks in the USA. "Salmonella is naturally occurring in poultry and can be fully eradicated if raw product is properly handled and fully cooked," O'Connor said.

Several European countries have succeeded in eradicating it in their flocks through stringent controls, but those controls are considered too costly to implement in the USA.

[It would not be likely that all the salmonellae would be identical, since 3 separate processing plants in California were reported to be involved. The high hospitalization rate reported may be a reflection of the population ingesting the undercooked chicken (as might occur in a geriatric nursing home) or perhaps a more virulent strain or group of strains.

As with enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ in ground beef, the combination of proper cooking procedures and good kitchen hygiene would have prevented most, if not all, of the cases.

It is likely that more specific information on this fairly large outbreak will be delayed due to the current political disagreements in the congress of the USA, which have affected, and will affect, surveillance of outbreaks of disease. - Mod.LL
