DF/DHF/DSS in Thailand: Corrected Figure
---------------------------------------
BANGKOK: I just want to make a correction to the total number of
dengue/dengue hemorrhagic fever cases in Thailand reported in the preceding
post. Since 1 Jan 2001 to 30 Jun 2001, a total of 43 699 cases of dengue
fever/dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DF/DHF/DSS) have been
notified, with 87 deaths.
