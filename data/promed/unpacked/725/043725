From: Camilla Rothe <rothe@bnitm.de> [edited]


On 11 Apr 2014, 2 German travelers (female 35, male 35) presented at Hamburg Tropical Institute with fever, back pain and extreme fatigue for 3 days. They had returned from a 2-week trip to Zanzibar on 5 Apr 2014.

The full blood count of the male traveler showed thrombocytopenia [low platelet count] of 78 000 per microliter [of blood]. Dengue rapid diagnostic tests for both travelers were positive. Serological results are pending.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Camilla Rothe for this firsthand report.

ProMED occasionally receives reports of dengue virus infection in individuals who have traveled to Africa and become infected there, however, without reports of cases of infection in local inhabitants in the areas where the travelers encountered their viruses. Clearly in the above cases, dengue virus was circulating in the areas that they visited.

[2] Tanzania (Dar es Salaam)
Date: Thu 10 Apr 2014

[During] an outbreak of dengue fever at Muhimbili University, a case of dengue fever was confirmed a few days ago after a middle-aged male developed high grade fever, headache, nausea and vomiting. [He was] initially managed as a case of malaria with no improvement.

Symptoms worsened over a period of 4 days, with aches, weakness, no rash, and no bleeding from the skin. His examination revealed fever, mild conjunctiva injection, no rash, and hypotension. Laboratory tests showed mild anemia, thrombocytopenia, leucopenia [decrease of white blood cells], and elevated AST, ALT. No malaria parasites [were seen] on a blood smear.

[He was] managed with I.V. fluids and broad spectrum antibiotics. A blood sample confirmed dengue [virus infection]. He made improvement upon conservative management. Two other similar cases were later reported in the same locality.

The University administration has now put up an alert for everyone to be vigilant and anyone with suspected symptoms to report to the emergency department.

[ProMED thanks Dr. G. Makanga for this firsthand report. Information coming directly from localities where dengue virus infections are occurring in Africa is especially appreciated.

The above case raises the question about how many dengue virus infections in Tanzania and other countries where malaria is common are being diagnosed as malaria in the absence of adequate laboratory testing. - Mod.TY]

Source: The Malaysian Insider, Malaysian National News Agency (Bernama) report [edited]
http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/63-deaths-from-dengue-from-january-to-april-4-this-year-bernama


Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr S Subramaniam says 63 deaths from dengue fever were recorded nationwide for the period [1 Jan to 4 Apr 2014]. He said 26 107 cases of dengue fever were reported nationwide during the period, and if no preventive measures were taken, it could be a major threat to the community and nation.

"In this regard, in conjunction with World Health Day this year [7 Apr 2014], I hope that Malaysians will be more aware of the threat of dengue, especially the _Aedes_ mosquito, the bearer of the dangerous disease [virus] which can kill," he said in a statement in Putrajaya, today [7 Apr 2014].

World Health Day is celebrated with the theme "Small Bite, Big Threat" in reference to the _Aedes_ mosquito.

The World Health Organisation has estimated that more than 2.5 billion, or 40 percent of the world's population, are at risk of being infected with dengue, and 50 million to 100 million dengue infections are expected each year. "This clearly shows that dengue fever has become a major burden to the world and is showing a very prolific rate of increase," it said.
