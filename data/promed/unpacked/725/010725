BSE Detected In Alberta
---------------------------
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) today [23 Jan 2006] confirmed
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in an approximately 6-year-old
cross-bred cow born and raised in Alberta. No part of the animal entered
the human food or animal feed systems.
This finding is not unexpected and was identified through Canada's national
surveillance program, which targets cattle at highest risk of being
infected with BSE. The program has tested more than 87 000 animals since
Canada's 1st BSE case in 2003.
The geographic location and age of this animal are consistent with the 3
domestic cases previously detected through the national BSE surveillance
program and the current understanding of BSE in Canada. The clustering of
these cases is examined in the epidemiological report "Canada's Assessment
of the North American BSE Cases Diagnosed from 2003 to 2005 (Part II),"
which is available on the CFIA's website
<http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/anima/heasan/disemala/bseesb/eval2005/evale.shtml>.
Food safety remains protected through the removal of specified risk
material (SRM) from all cattle slaughtered for human food in Canada. SRM
are tissues that, in infected cattle, contain the BSE agent. This measure
is internationally recognized as the most effective means to protect public
health from BSE.
The CFIA, working collaboratively with the producer and the Province of
Alberta, has launched a comprehensive investigation into the feeding regime
and storage practices employed on the farm as well as the production and
source of feeds delivered to the farm. Consistent with international
standards, the CFIA will identify cattle born on the farm within 12 months
before and after the affected animal as well as offspring of the affected
animal born during the last 2 years. Any live animals found from these
groups will be segregated and tested.
Definitive conclusions regarding the source of infectivity cannot be made
until the investigation is complete; however, it is probable that the
source is contaminated feed. This scenario is consistent with Canada's
previous experience and that of the international community. Although the
1st evidence of BSE in the Canadian herd was found in May 2003, and this
recent animal would have become infected with the disease prior to that
time, this case does support the need for Canada to continue to move
towards enhancing the current feed ban. In December 2004, there was a
formal call for comments on the draft regulations through the Canada
Gazette, regulations which have been the subject of extensive consultations
with the provinces and industry. The CFIA has completed its analysis and is
prepared to provide advice to the government on next steps.
Canada has a suite of safeguards that work together to systematically limit
the risks to animal and public health associated with BSE. These measures
include import controls, surveillance of the national cattle herd and the
removal of potentially harmful tissues from all animals slaughtered for
human consumption. Of principal importance from an animal health
perspective is Canada's feed ban, which is designed to limit BSE spread and
eradicate the disease over time. Analysis of previous Canadian
investigations and surveillance results to date continue to indicate that
Canada's feed ban is working as intended to effectively reduce BSE risks to
animal health through a robust compliance and enforcement strategy. Our
experiences related to the feed ban and finding cases born after the feed
ban are in keeping with other countries.
This detection is consistent with a low level of disease and does not
indicate an increased risk of BSE in Canada. Based on the guidelines and
certification recommendations of the World Organization for Animal Health,
this finding should not affect Canada's ability to export live animals,
beef and beef products. Canada has notified its key trading partners,
including the United States. Since May 2003, Canada has clearly stated the
possibility of finding a small number of additional BSE cases. This
international dialogue will continue as Canadian officials work closely
with their international counterparts to ensure the facts and supporting
science of this case are shared in an open and timely manner.
As the investigation progresses, the CFIA will provide Canadians with
regular updates. Information will be posted to the CFIA's website as it
becomes available.

[Undoubtedly, Canada had hoped to find no more cases, but clearly, their
surveillance is working. Let us hope that the US learns from our neighbors
to the north and continues its surveillance programs.
Alberta is to where the very 1st Canadian BSE cow was traced. - Mod.TG]
