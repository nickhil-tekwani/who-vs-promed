A subset of healthcare workers vaccinated against COVID-19 had unexpectedly low responses to the immunizations, according to Cedars-Sinai investigators. The findings of the new study are published in iScience, a Cell Press journal.

In a matched control study, investigators compared the vaccine responses among a group of Cedars-Sinai healthcare workers who were generally in good health. The study participants received the BNT162b2 vaccine produced by Pfizer Inc., and their average age was 48.

"It turns out that a small percentage of the healthcare worker population we studied did not have a robust response to the BNT162b2 vaccine. After vaccination, they produced lower levels of antibodies to the spike protein found on the surface of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. That low response persisted even after they received 2nd and 3rd booster doses," said Peter Chen, MD, who holds the Medallion Chair in Molecular Medicine at Cedars-Sinai and is one of the study's senior authors.

Investigators noted that the "low responders" in the study were relatively young, but their immune systems reacted to the vaccine as if they were much older.

This study is part of the ongoing Coronavirus Risk Associations and Longitudinal Evaluation (CORALE) project led by Cedars-Sinai. Investigators say this study finding of a low vaccine response among otherwise healthy people requires further research.

"We would like to study the pathways that led to the premature aging phenotype to determine if it is specifically responsible for lower antibody levels after vaccination and then try and develop a therapeutic intervention to reverse this effect," said Susan Cheng, MD, MPH, the Erika J. Glazer Chair in Women's Cardiovascular Health and Population Science and a corresponding author of the study.

"Also, our study did not evaluate the lymphocytes that are responsible for killing the cells that are already infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus; this is an important element of immunity against COVID-19," said Cheng, who is also director of the Institute for Research on Healthy Aging in the Department of Cardiology at the Smidt Heart Institute.

Investigators emphasize that while some people's immune systems have a low antibody response to the vaccine, the evidence that vaccination is a very effective tool for preventing serious illness and death from COVID-19 remains strong.

"We should all get vaccinated because the BNT162b2 vaccine we studied still provided some immunity in most of the low responders. This group still had memory cells that can generate more antibodies when attacked by the virus, even if at a lower level," said Chen, director of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Cedars-Sinai.

A study published by The BMJ today [26 Oct 2022] sheds further light on the risk of developing a very rare blood-clotting condition known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) after vaccination against the COVID-19 virus.

Health data from 5 European countries and the US shows a small increased risk of TTS after a 1st dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, and a trend towards an increased risk after the Janssen/Johnson & Johnson vaccine, compared with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.

The researchers stress that this syndrome is very rare, but say these observed risks "should be considered when planning further immunization campaigns and future vaccine development."

TTS occurs when a person has blood clots (thrombosis) as well as low blood platelet counts (thrombocytopenia). It's very rare and different from general clotting conditions like deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or lung clots (pulmonary embolism).

TTS is currently being investigated as a rare side effect of adenovirus based COVID-19 vaccines, which use a weakened virus to trigger an immune response against coronavirus, but no clear evidence exists on the comparative safety of different types of vaccines.

To address this knowledge gap, an international team of researchers set out to compare the risk of TTS or thromboembolic events associated with use of adenovirus based COVID-19 vaccines with mRNA based COVID-19 vaccines.

Their findings are based on routinely collected health data for over 10 million adults in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, the UK, and the US who received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine (Oxford-AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna or Janssen/Johnson & Johnson) from December 2020 to mid-2021.

To minimize possible error, participants were matched by age and sex and a range of other potentially influential factors such as pre-existing conditions and medication use were taken into account.

The researchers then compared rates of thrombosis and of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia between the adenovirus vaccines (Oxford-AstraZeneca or Janssen/Johnson & Johnson) and the mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) within 28 days after vaccination.

Overall, 1.3 million 1st dose Oxford-AstraZeneca recipients were matched to 2.1 million Pfizer-BioNTech recipients from Germany and the UK.

An additional 762 517 people receiving Janssen/Johnson & Johnson were matched to 2.8 million receiving Pfizer-BioNTech in Germany, Spain, and the US, and all 628 164 Janssen/Johnson & Johnson recipients from the US were matched to 2.2 million Moderna recipients.

A total of 862 thrombocytopenia events were found in the matched 1st dose Oxford-AstraZeneca recipients from Germany and the UK, and 520 events after a 1st dose of Pfizer-BioNTech.

When the data were pooled together, analysis showed a 30% increased risk of thrombocytopenia after a 1st dose of Oxford-AstraZeneca compared with Pfizer-BioNTech -- an absolute risk difference of 8.21 per 100 000 recipients.

An increase in risk, albeit not statistically significant, of venous thrombosis with thrombocytopenia was observed after a 1st vaccine dose of Janssen/Johnson & Johnson compared with Pfizer-BioNTech. But the researchers say this finding needs to be replicated in other studies before any firm conclusions can be drawn.

No differential risk of thrombocytopenia was seen after a 2nd dose of Oxford-AstraZeneca compared with a 2nd dose of Pfizer-BioNTech. Similarly, no increased risk of thrombocytopenia was noted after Janssen/Johnson & Johnson compared with a 1st dose of Pfizer-BioNTech.

This is an observational study, and the researchers acknowledge that the rarity of the condition and incomplete vaccine records may have affected the results. What's more, they can't rule out the possibility that some of the observed risk may have been due to other unmeasured (confounding) factors.

However, this was a well-designed study that allowed comparison of available vaccines with each other, rather than with no vaccination, and the results were consistent after additional analyses, suggesting that they withstand scrutiny.

"To our knowledge, this is the 1st multinational analysis of the comparative safety of adenovirus based compared with mRNA based COVID-19 vaccines," say the authors.

"Although these events are very rare, absolute numbers of affected patients could become substantial owing to the large numbers of vaccine doses administered worldwide," they warn.

As such, they suggest that the observed risks after adenovirus based vaccines "should be considered when planning further immunization campaigns and future vaccine development."

[Although some observational studies have examined the risk of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome after COVID-19 vaccination in some European countries, no clear evidence exists on the comparative safety profile of different vaccines. Given the high number of SARS-CoV-2 infections and reinfections seen worldwide, and the known effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in minimising severe infection and complications, understanding the risks of the available vaccines compared with each other is essential, rather than comparing them with no vaccination.

This is the 1st multinational analysis of the comparative safety of adenovirus based COVID-19 vaccines compared with mRNA based COVID-19 vaccines using routinely collected data from Europe and the US.

A 30% increased risk of thrombocytopenia was seen after 1st dose ChAdOx1-S compared with 1st dose BNT162b2 vaccination. A trend towards an increased risk of venous thrombosis with thrombocytopenia was observed after a 1st vaccine dose of Ad26.COV2.S, which needs replication elsewhere. The study concluded "In this multinational study, a pooled 30% increased risk of thrombocytopenia after a 1st dose of the ChAdOx1-S vaccine was observed, as was a trend towards an increased risk of venous thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome after Ad26.COV2.S compared with BNT162b2.

Although rare, the observed risks after adenovirus based vaccines should be considered when planning further immunisation campaigns and future vaccine development." - Mod.UBA]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has caused considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide. The protection provided by vaccines and booster doses offered a method of mitigating severe clinical outcomes and mortality. However, by the end of 2021, the global distribution of vaccines was highly heterogeneous, with some countries gaining over 90% coverage in adults, whereas others reached less than 2%. In this study, we used an age-structured model of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics, matched to national data from 152 countries in 2021, to investigate the global impact of different potential vaccine sharing protocols that attempted to address this inequity. We quantified the effects of implemented vaccine rollout strategies on the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the subsequent global burden of disease and the emergence of novel variants. We found that greater vaccine sharing would have lowered the total global burden of disease, and any associated increases in infections in previously vaccine-rich coountries could have been mitigated by reduced relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions. Our results reinforce the health message, pertinent to future pandemics, that vaccine distribution proportional to wealth, rather than to need, may be detrimental to all.

[The modeling data suggests that as many as 3.8 million more lives lost to COVID-19 could have been saved. The disparity is indicated by the fact that vaccination rates were 75% in high-income countries, but less than 2% in some low-income countries.

A previous study conducted by Watson et al., which used a similar modeling technique but with different data, concluded that about 45% of COVID-19 deaths in low-income countries could have been averted if the countries had achieved 20% vaccination coverage by the end of 2021, a target set by the global vaccine-sharing campaign COVAX [Watson, O. J. et al. Lancet Infect. Dis. https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(22)00320-6] - Mod.UBA].
