------------------------------------
On 12 Oct 2018, 5 confirmed cases of mumps among migrants who had been transferred between 2 detention facilities were reported by the facilities to the Texas Department of State Health Services (TDSHS). By 11 Dec 2018, 8 Texas detention facilities and 6 facilities in 5 other states had reported 67 mumps cases to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Health Service Corps (IHSC) or local health departments.

On 12 Dec 2018, TDSHS contacted CDC to discuss mumps control in detention facilities and facilitate communication with IHSC. During 4-17 Jan 2019, 6 more state health departments reported new cases in detention facilities, which prompted CDC and IHSC to launch a coordinated national outbreak response.

During 1 Sep 2018-22 Aug 2019, a total of 898 confirmed and probable mumps cases (1) in adult migrants detained in 57 facilities (18% of 315 U.S. facilities that house ICE detainees*) were reported in 19 states (Figure); an additional 33 cases occurred among staff members. Private companies operated 34 facilities; 19 were county jails that house detained migrants, and 4 were ICE-operated. 44 percent (394) of cases were reported from facilities that house ICE detainees in Texas.

Median patient age was 25 years (range = 17-67); 846 (94%) were male. Based on detainee custody status during their incubation period (12-25 days before symptom onset), most (758, 84%) patients were exposed while in custody of ICE or another U.S. agency; 43 (5%) were exposed before apprehension; and the custody status at the time of exposure of 97 (11%) was unknown. Among those with data on complications, 79 (15%) of 527 male patients reported orchitis, and at least 13 patients were hospitalized. More than half (576, 64%) of cases were confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing or viral culture testing at CDC, state public health laboratories, Association of Public Health Laboratories-CDC Vaccine Preventable Disease Reference Centers, or commercial laboratories. Sequencing of isolates from 70 patients identified genotype G, the most common mumps genotype detected in the United States since 2006 (2). IHSC provided over 25 000 doses of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine in response to mumps in 56 facilities.

Since 2015, approximately 150 mumps outbreaks and 16 000 cases have been reported in the United States, typically in close-contact settings such as universities, schools, and athletic events. This is the 1st report of mumps outbreaks in detention facilities.

MMR vaccination efforts differ among detention facilities; facilities should follow local or state health department recommendations for preventing and responding to mumps (3) and should report cases and follow disease control guidance from their health department. Detainees and staff members at increased risk for mumps should be offered MMR vaccine per existing recommendations for vaccination during outbreaks (4,5). MMR vaccine has not been shown to be effective at preventing disease in persons already infected with mumps; facilities should be aware that cases might occur among detainees exposed before vaccination.

Health departments, CDC, IHSC, and facility health administration can work together to develop appropriate control measures based on local epidemiology and the specific needs of each facility. Identifying and vaccinating close contacts of exposed or symptomatic persons with mumps in detention centers is challenging. IHSC can look up transfer history and facilitate vaccine procurement for detainees in ICE custody upon request from facility health services administrators. CDC is coordinating communication among state and local health departments, IHSC, and other federal partners to mobilize appropriate resources and is providing technical support for implementing appropriate disease control and prevention measures. Effective public health interventions require understanding of facility and custody operations, which often involve frequent transfers of detainees (between facilities and states) and multiple entities with authority for operations and detainee custody.

As of 22 Aug 2019, mumps outbreaks are ongoing in 15 facilities in 7 states, and new introductions into detention facilities through detainees who are transferred or exposed before being taken into custody continue to occur.

[Mumps is a viral illness caused by a paramyxovirus, family Rubulavirus. It spreads through direct contact with saliva or respiratory droplets from the mouth, nose, or throat. An infected person can spread the virus by
- coughing, sneezing, or talking
- sharing items that may have saliva on them, such as water bottles or cups
- participating in close-contact activities with others, such as playing sports, dancing, or kissing
- touching objects or surfaces with unwashed hands that are then touched by others

An infected person can likely spread mumps from a few days before their salivary glands begin to swell to up to 5 days after the swelling begins. A person with mumps should limit their contact with others during this time.

Before the U.S. mumps vaccination program started in 1967, about 186 000 cases were reported each year, and many more unreported cases occurred. The disease caused complications, such as permanent deafness in children, and, occasionally, encephalitis, which could rarely result in death. Since the pre-vaccine era, there has been a more than 99% decrease in mumps cases in the United States. From year to year, the number of mumps cases can range from roughly a couple hundred to a couple thousand. However, outbreaks still occur, even among highly vaccinated populations.

Orchitis occurs in approximately 20-30% of unvaccinated and 6-7% of vaccinated post-pubertal male mumps patients [In this report, 15% of the cases were noted to have this complication]. In 60% to 83% of males with mumps orchitis, only one testis is affected. Mumps orchitis has not been linked to infertility but may result in testicular atrophy and hypo-fertility (excerpted from https://www.cdc.gov/mumps/hcp.html).

Detention facilities such as those on the US-Mexico border provide the perfect environment for mumps and other highly infectious diseases such as influenza and TB to spread among detainees. It is not clear what is being done to protect the health of at-risk detainees. See earlier ProMED-mail posts on mumps in these facilities. - Mod.LK

Health officials are warning residents of mumps after 2 recent outbreaks in northeast Nebraska.

The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) said that 30 cases were identified in the jurisdictions of the Nebraska Public Health Department and Four Corners Health Department. Nebraska Public Health Department manages Cedar, Dixon, Thurston and Wayne counties, while Four Corners Health Department's jurisdiction includes Butler, Polk, York and Seward counties.

Of the 30 cases, most were among people attending a wedding in northeast Nebraska and at a work environment in the Four Corners Health Department jurisdiction.

The DHHS said they are working to investigate the cases as they work with the local health departments.

In 2018, there were only 12 reported cases of mumps and 6 in 2017. There were 49 cases in 2016.
