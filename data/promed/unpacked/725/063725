[The causative agents of sheep pox and goat pox are members of the _Capripox_ genus in the family Poxviridae. Most isolates cause disease exclusively/mainly in sheep or exclusively/mainly in goats; some isolates can cause serious disease in both species. The causative viruses cannot be distinguished from each other with current techniques. Sheep and goat pox viruses cause disease only in these 2 species.

The event in Dagestan seems to have affected sheep exclusively, controlled by "vaccination in response to the outbreak." During the previous OIE report addressing 'sheep & goat pox' in Dagestan, published in August 2015, stamping-out policy was applied (20150807.3563227). It may be assumed that the disease is regarded as regionally endemic.

Commercially available sheep/goat vaccines are live-attenuated. According to OIE's Terrestrial Manual, the immunity to virulent field virus following vaccination of sheep or goats with the 0240 strain lasts over 1 year, and protection against generalized infection following intradermal challenge lasts at least 3 years and is effective lifelong. It is expected that data related to other vaccine strains/manufacturer will present close-to-similar values. We have no information on the vaccine currently applied in Dagestan. - Mod.AS

The previous event of sheep pox and goat pox (SGP) in Russia started in July 2019; 18 outbreaks were reported and the event was communicated as resolved on 16 Dec 2020. The final report and map are available at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000037346_20201230_132541.pdf

Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Sheep / 3356 / 841 / 569 / 384 / 0
Goats / 43 / 2 / 0 / 25 / 0

SGP does not pose a risk to human health. - Mod.CRD
