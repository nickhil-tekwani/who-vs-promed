Pakistan: 4 more Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever cases admitted to hospital
------------------------------------------------
4 people, including 2 Afghans, suffering from suspected Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever virus infection have been admitted to the hospital in
Quetta (Baluchistan), where the highly contagious disease claimed 3 lives
in May 2004, a senior Health Ministry official said on Sun 16 May 2004.

The Afghans, who came from Afghanistan's southern Kandahar province, were
admitted to the Fatima Jinnah Hospital in Quetta, provincial Health
Secretary Pir Jan Khawajakahil said. They had high fever and were bleeding
through the mouth and nose, he said. He added that one Pakistani, with
similar symptoms, was brought from Qila Saifullah, 160 kilometres north
east of Quetta and another from Zhob district, bordering Afghanistan. "We
are quite sure they are suffering from Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever,"
Khawajakhail said. The patients, quarantined in a special isolation ward,
were receiving treatment, including blood transfusions, and were showing
signs of improvement, he added. A Pakistani couple, and their son from Qila
Saifullah, died on 1 May 2004 after bleeding through multiple body
openings, hospital officials said last week [2nd week of May 2004].

Blood samples from the victims who died of suspected Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever have been sent to South Africa for further tests.
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus is a tickborne virus stemming from
livestock, which is transmitted into open cuts and sores. It causes massive
bleeding through the nose, mouth and ears and can lead to organ failure.
This extremely contagious disease can be passed on by contact with the
blood, and other body fluids, of a patient. Initial symptoms include
headaches, fever, and vomiting. Khawajakhail said health teams had been
sent to the affected areas to create awareness among the villagers. They
have been advised not to kill ticks by hand, instead they should crush them
with stones.

[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is endemic in the border region between
the Baluchistan province of Pakistan and Afghanistan. Although the initial
diagnosis of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is based on a clinical
assessment in the hospital in Quetta, it can be assumed, with reasonable
confidence, that it is unlikely to be contradicted by the subsequent
laboratory diagnosis in South Africa. - Mod.CP]
