The provincial veterinary office (PVET) confirmed the presence of a case of anthrax in the town of Santo Ni単o, Cagayan. On 23 Nov 2022 the livestock technician of the local government first reported to the PVET Disease Surveillance Task Force the sudden illness of some domestic buffaloes in Barangay Calassitan. They were seen with symptoms of anthrax, such as loss of appetite, lethargy or difficulty moving and hematuria or the presence of blood in the urine and sudden death.

PVET conducted an investigation in collaboration with the Santo Ni単o Office of the Municipal Agriculturist, Regional Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory and Animal Health and Welfare Unit of the Regulatory Division of the Department of Agriculture (DA) in Region 2, and the Department of Health (DOH)-Cagayan Valley.

The test results came out recently, and it was confirmed that 4 buffaloes were affected by anthrax. Two of the buffaloes were slaughtered and sold by the owners. The buffalo meat has even reached Barangay Annafatan, Amulung.

According to Dr. Myka Ponce of PVET, among 73 people in Barangay Calassitan, Santo Ni単o who were exposed, 22 had cutaneous lesions or skin wounds. They are now undergoing isolation and close observation.

Meanwhile, around 60 people were exposed to the infected carcass or meat in Barangay Annafatan, Amulung. The observation of exposed individuals who did not show symptoms of the disease is also ongoing.

Anthrax is a disease caused by a type of bacteria that develops from a spore called _Bacillus anthracis_ and usually affects domestic animals. "Anthrax can affect ruminants such as buffalo, cattle, goats, sheep, horses, pigs, dogs, cats and other wild herbivores. Other signs of this disease in animals are fever, seizures, pain in the heart, bleeding and postmortem lesions," said Ponce. He said the infection caused by anthrax can be transmitted to humans through cutaneous contact, digestion and inhalation.

Its symptoms include the presence of blisters or lumps that itch, skin sores on the face, neck, arms and hands, fever, chills, dizziness, headache, body aches, sore throat, swelling of the neck or glands, pain of stomach, vomiting, and diarrhea. The disease can also be cured through immediate medical intervention and the use of antibiotics.

PVET advice to those who care for animals, report immediately to the authorities if there are any observed symptoms of anthrax. They are also requested not to slaughter and immediately dispose of the dead animal by burning or burying it in a deep pit.

The concerned agencies are also conducting mass information dissemination on how to prevent the disease and what to do in the event of an outbreak. On 16 Dec 2022, PVET and DA Region 2 conducted an anthrax massive vaccination among animals at risk in the anthrax zone town of Santo Ni単o and in the neighboring towns of Amulung and Alcala.

["The carabao is a domestic swamp-type water buffalo (_Bubalus bubalis_) native to the Philippines. Carabaos were introduced to Guam from the Spanish Philippines in the 17th century. They have acquired great cultural significance to the Chamorro people and are considered the unofficial national animal of Guam. In Malaysia, carabaos (known as kerbau in Malay) are the official animal of the state of Negeri Sembilan" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carabao).

It is clear that the local authorities have this recent outbreak under control, and the at-risk livestock are being vaccinated. It is still early days, so there is no information on any investigation as to how these carabao got infected. Instructing the public to not slaughter and butcher sick animals sometimes works. The most cost-effective way to prevent human cases of anthrax is to ensure that the livestock are vaccinated and that any unexpected death is immediately reported to the veterinary authorities. If it is fiscally possible, one can follow the Canadian example of paying an agreed sum to the livestock owners reporting a sudden death on its confirmation of anthrax. The Canadians started this in the mid-1960s when there was slight information but definite suspicion that there might be livestock cases going unrecognised. It was immediately very successful, revealing a real risk, and was the start of their ultimately very successful and effective control and surveillance program.

Thanks to Mahmoud and Susan, we have received multiple reports of this outbreak in the Philippines. - Mod.MHJ
