-----------------------------------------------------------------
A group of authors are to be highly commended for reporting a higher risk
of death associated with influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection
among American Indian/Alaska Natives (AIANs) when compared with the rest of
the population (1). This complements what has been described already among
several indigenous populations of the Americas and the Pacific region (2).
Reasons for this increased risk are probably multifactorial, including
higher risk of pregnancy and health disorders linked to severe forms
(particularly diabetes and asthma, with severity indexes not detailed in
the article), poverty, delayed access to health care and, possibly, genetic
factors (1,2). This increased vulnerability regarding deaths associated
with pandemic influenza remains of the same magnitude as that described
almost one century ago: the mortality rate ratio described during the
influenza (H1N1) 2009 pandemic is 4-fold higher among the AIAN population,
and this is equivalent to the disparity observed during the influenza
pandemic of 1918-1919 (3).

Interestingly, the report from CDC [US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention] demonstrates that even among persons with diabetes or asthma,
the risk among AIANs remains twice that of other ethnic groups, thus
pointing to the importance of factors other than underlying diseases, such
as access to health care or genetic factors, or reflecting higher,
non-detailed severity of these underlying diseases in AIAN populations.

Unfortunately, the CDC definition of high-risk groups for influenza
complications does not include obesity, as it had not been considered as a
risk factor in previous pandemics or seasonal influenza. This factor is
more frequent in indigenous populations (2) and seems to be of great
importance in the current pandemic (4). We believe that further studies or
analyses must take obesity into account.

[An earlier more limited comparison of American Indian/Alaskan native
hospitalised patients with hospitalised patients from the general
population of Anchorage (see ProMED-mail Influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009
(118): USA (AK) ethnicity 20091201.4108) concluded that ethnicity might be
a factor influencing the severity of response to infection by the pandemic
(H1N1) 2009 influenza virus. In both groups, however, asthma was identified
as the principal predisposing factor in development of severe disease.
Information on obesity was not reported, but should also be considered as a
predisposing factor. - Mod.CP]
