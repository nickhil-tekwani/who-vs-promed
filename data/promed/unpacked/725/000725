A sample of China-produced pork sausages ditched by tourists at Kaohsiung International Airport was again found to have been contaminated with the African swine fever [ASF] virus, the Council of Agriculture announced Friday [30 Nov 2018]. The incident marks the 3rd time Taiwan has intercepted pork meat products carrying the virus following cases reported on 31 Oct and 13 Nov 2018.

South Korea, Japan, and Thailand have reported similar cases over the past months, with sausages and other pork products imported by Chinese travelers testing positive for the virus.

Visitors are warned not to attempt smuggling dubious meat products into Taiwan, as such actions could cost them a fortune. An amendment to the Statute for Prevention and Control of Infectious Animal Disease passed a 3rd reading on 30 Nov 2018, which will subject violators to fines between NTD 10 000 (USD 322) and NTD 1 million (USD 32 150), noted COA.

Since August [2018], efforts have been ramped up to conduct inspection at immigration checkpoints targeting visitors arriving from China so as to keep undeclared pork products from entering the country.

A total of 265 violations involving fines of NTD 15 000 (USD 485) were recorded between 1 Sep and 25 Nov 2018, among which 160 violators were from China and 73 from Viet Nam, according to Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine.

[It is becoming apparent that ASF contamination in China's pork products is not rare, though its actual extent is not (yet) known. From such products, which can get to any place on earth, the virus may continue to farmed pigs, particularly in backyard pig farms, by kitchen waste getting incorporated in (untreated) swill, or served directly, or otherwise. Another route could include feral pigs/wild boar accessing garbage or waste.

The experience gained by Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and Thailand should serve all ASF-free countries. - Mod.AS
