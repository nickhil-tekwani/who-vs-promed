Scientists from the [Pune]city-based National Institute of Virology (NIV) have confirmed the presence of enterovirus which, they said, has been causing hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in children in Pune [Maharashtra state; the city was formerly known as Poona]. The contagious viral illness has been spreading among children below 5 years of age in the last 2 months. Of the 79 samples drawn by the scientists, 40 per cent tested positive for enterovirus.

"The circulating virus in the city, causing HFMD in infants and children, is enterovirus. The infection caused by the virus is usually mild. Hence, there is no need to panic," said senior scientist D T Mourya, director of NIV. The viral infection, benign but irritating, is characterised by painful rashes along with throat [pain] and fever. Coxsackieviruses and enteroviruses are the major causative agents of HFMD in India. This is the 1st time that the Virology Institute investigated HFMD cases in Pune after doctors reported a spurt [of cases] since October [2013]. Earlier, it had carried out HFMD investigations in Kerala, West Bengal, Odisha, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu in 2009-2010. Scientist V Gopalkrishna, Deputy Director of NIV, who spearheaded the HFMD study along with paediatricians, said, "79 clinical samples comprising throat swabs, rectal swabs, vesicular swabs and blood samples were collected from children below 7 years of age with suspected HFMD in Pune who went to paediatricians' clinics and hospitals for treatment in the last 2 months. Nearly 40 per cent of the samples tested positive for the etiological agent enterovirus. Now, cases are on the decline." Paediatricians from Shaishav clinic, Chiranjeev clinic, Bharati Hospital and Ajinkya Hospital from the city were involved in this study with NIV scientists.

"If a child is not eating and shows loss of appetite and has mouth ulcers, then it is time to consult a doctor," said paediatrician Sharad Agarkhedkar. Paediatrician Jayant Navarange, who is part of the NIV study and has been treating kids with HFMD in the last 2 months, said, "HFMD is contagious. Hence, infected children should stay away from schools till they completely recover," he added.

[HFMD is a common viral illness that usually affects infants and children younger than 5 years old. However, it can sometimes occur in adults. Symptoms of HFMD include fever, blister-like sores in the mouth (herpangina) and a skin rash. HFMD is caused by viruses that belong to the genus _Enterovirus_. This group of viruses includes polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and enteroviruses. Coxsackievirus A16 is the most common cause of HFMD in the United States, but other coxsackieviruses have been associated with the illness. Enterovirus 71 has been associated with more severe outbreaks of HFMD (see: http://www.cdc.gov/hand-foot-mouth/about/index.html).

HFMD is prevalent globally and infects children in all communities. Since normally the infection is mild and of short duration, there has been little incentive to identify the specific etiologic agent. Normally ProMED-mail does not record these outbreaks unless the specific etiologic agent has been identified, or there is some unusual feature. The outbreak in Pune is exceptional in that the etiologic agents have been identified. Curiously the etiologic agent was only identified in less than 40 per cent of cases.

The Western Pacific Region of WHO routinely publishes data on the incidence of HFMD throughout East Asia (but not India) [see: http://www.wpro.who.int/emerging_diseases/HFMD/en/]. The most recent update (13 Nov 2013) reported that HFMD is declining. Hong Kong (China), Macao (China), Japan and Republic of Korea (South Korea) have reported a higher cumulative number of cases in 2013 than in 2012 for the same time period. The recent trend, following seasonal patterns, is showing a decrease in China, Hong Kong (China), Macao (China), Japan, Republic of Korea, Singapore and Viet Nam.

China: Monthly average of cases has decreased from September (183 187 cases and 14 deaths) to October (134 032 cases and 8 deaths) 2013. There were 1 651 959 cases with 265 deaths reported up to the end of October in 2013.

Hong Kong (China): Surveillance for HFMD is conducted through sentinel reporting units. Based on the 3 week moving average, weekly trends in hospitalized cases, general practitioners, and general outpatient clinics decreased. In the week 27 Oct to 2 Nov 2013, 4 HFMD inpatients (relative to 5 cases in the same period in 2012) were reported by the Hospital Authority; 0.1 cases per 1000 consultations among general out-patient clinics and 0.9 cases per 1000 consultations among general practitioners.

Macao (China): Weekly trend has decreased based on the 3 week moving average. 19 cases were reported from 29 Oct to 4 Nov 2013 compared with 30 cases in the same period for 2012. The cumulative report for 2013 to the week ending 4 Nov was 2078 cases.

Japan: Surveillance for HFMD is conducted through sentinel reporting units. The weekly trend decreased based on the 3 week moving average. 4071 cases (1.29 cases per sentinel unit) were reported from 14 to 20 Oct 2013 compared with 1998 cases in the same period for 2012. Cumulative total for 2013 to the week ending 20 Oct was 281 149 cases.

Republic of Korea (South Korea): Surveillance for HFMD is conducted through sentinel reporting units. The weekly trend is decreasing based on the 3 week moving average; 3.0 cases per 1000 outpatients for the week ending 5 Oct 2013. Cumulative total for 2013 to the week ending 5 Oct was 6.3 cases per 1000 outpatients.

Singapore: The weekly trend increased based on the 3 week moving average; 914 cases were reported between 27 Oct to 2 Nov 2013 (relative to 265 for the same period in 2012). Cumulative total for 2013 to the week ending 2 Nov 2013 was 26 473 cases.

Viet Nam: The weekly number of reported cases during 7 to 13 Oct 2013 was 1610 relative to 1656 during the previous week. 63 109 cases with 19 deaths have been reported from across 63 provinces up to 13 Oct 2013.

It is unfortunate that there is so little determination of the etiologic agent(s) involved.
