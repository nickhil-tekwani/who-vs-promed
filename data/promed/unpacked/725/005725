Assam continues to be plagued by acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) with 24 positive JE [Japanese encephalitis] cases and 7 casualties reported so far till Monday [13 Jun 2016].

Assam witnessed 863 deaths due to JE from 1996 to 2007. In 2001, 160 succumbed due to JE. The following year, 472 JE cases were reported.

Experts highlighted that despite consistent awareness programmes towards prevention of JE, community consciousness towards the disease in rural pockets was still lacking.

People dwelling in the rural pockets of the state are the most vulnerable as their local living habitats are mostly surrounded by paddy fields and pools of water with a thriving pig population and birds that act as amplifying agents.

Till Monday [13 Jun 2016], Sivasagar district reported 6 JE-positive cases, and Nalbari district reported the highest casualties so far at 3. Fear still persists that there may be further escalation in the number of positive cases in the following days, as the peak season has just culminated.

[The Japanese encephalitis virus transmission season appears to be well underway in Assam. The number of cases has increased from 6 on 1 Jun 2016 to the 24 cases mentioned above, just 2 weeks later.

It is unfortunate that acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) is mentioned in this report, whereas only JE is mentioned as the etiologic agent responsible for these cases. AES is a term used for multiple etiologies or often when no etiology has been determined. No mention is made of the JE vaccination status of these affected individuals. A previous ProMED-mail post (archive no. 20160613.4283791) indicated that there was a JE vaccination effort made in 11 districts 2 years ago, but there is no mention made of a vaccination campaign planned for this season. - Mod.TY]
