A cow in a large Madison County cattle herd has brucellosis, according to the Montana Department of Livestock.

The cow was identified during a herd test by a producer whose cattle graze within the state's Designated Surveillance Area. The National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa, confirmed the infection.

State veterinarian Marty Zaluski said the area has been quarantined and adjacent livestock producers are being notified.

The state is not at risk of losing its brucellosis-free status based on regulations from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal & Plant Health Inspection Service.

As with previous cases of brucellosis in livestock, adjacent producers will test livestock as part of an epidemiological investigation to determine the source of the infection. Previous epidemiological investigations of brucellosis in livestock in Montana, Idaho and Wyoming indicated that elk were the most likely source.

"We don't like finding brucellosis-positive cows, but if it's out there, we want to find it before cattle are shipped to market or out of state," Zaluski said. "That's why we have a program; we have to assure other states we're doing everything we can to manage this endemic wildlife disease problem."

Similar to affected herds in the past, the low infection rate indicates early detection. "It demonstrates that our aggressive surveillance program finds the disease before it is allowed to spread within the herd, which reduces costs for producers and minimizes risk for our trading partners," he said.

The state has now found at least one case of brucellosis in cattle in 5 of the past 8 years.

[Bovine brucellosis (caused by _Brucella abortus_) has caused devastating losses to farmers in the United States over the last century. Collaborative efforts by the US Department of Agriculture, the livestock industries, and state animal health authorities achieved brucellosis-free status in 48 states with no known infection since 2002.

The only known focus of _Brucella abortus_ infection left in the nation is in bison and elk, which originally acquired the infection from cattle. The bacterium became established in these wildlife species and does not currently pose a threat for their populations. However, it does represent a big concern for domestic livestock.

Elk, also known as wapiti (_Cervus canadensis_), are a reservoir of the disease, originally acquired from cattle. The elk are free to move in and out of the national park of Yellowstone. The elk feed at feeding grounds in the park. It is a tremendous tourist draw to see the large number of impressive animals. Some of these animals give birth to a calf at or near the feeding grounds. _Brucella abortus_, the organism responsible for the disease brucellosis, is often spread through the birthing process, fluids, and tissues. Other animals investigate the birthing site and probably become infected with the organism at that time. These same elk are free to move in and out of the park region, and thus may be spreading the disease to cattle they come into contact with in the area, thus, the article's statement of the likely source of the disease in the cow in question being elk.

In areas where a cow is found positive, the producers test their animals prior to moving them to market. This can be time consuming and is certainly an added cost to the producer.

The Greater Yellowstone Area (GYA) is a portion of 3 states, Idaho, Montana and Wyoming. A map of the GYA showing the 3 states involved is located at http://www.yellowstonegeotourism.org/. - Mod.TG
