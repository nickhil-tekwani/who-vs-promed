Health authorities have found 2 more puppies given away at a Wal-mart/Jack
in the Box parking lot in Decatur, in Wise County, [Texas, 19 Nov 2000,
after another puppy from the litter tested positive for rabies. Texas
Department of Health (TDH) officials continue to look for people who owned
or were given other puppies from the same litter. The parking lot is
located adjacent to U.S. Highway 287 in Decatur. TDH officials believe
the rabid puppy was exposed to a rabid skunk before being given to a
resident of adjacent Montague County. The 2 puppies that were given to one
family in Rhome in Wise County are now isolated and will be under
observation for 90 days for rabies. Each of these 2 puppies has received
the first of 3 rabies shots. Other puppies in the litter also could have
been exposed to rabies and could spread the deadly virus.
Anyone who has information about the puppies' new or original owners should
contact Monty Fitzgerald, City of Decatur animal control officer, at
940-627-7888; or Jan Buck, zoonosis control technician with TDH's regional
office in Arlington, at 817-264-4920. The Wise County Messenger newspaper
has a photo of the 2 recently found puppies on its Web site at
www.wcmessenger.com.
Rabies is most often transmitted by bites, but transmission can occur in
other ways that allow the saliva from an infected animal to enter a
person's body. A series of post-exposure shots, if given in time, can
prevent rabies from developing. Once symptoms develop, rabies is almost
always fatal.
For more information contact Jan Buck, TDH Zoonosis Control Technician,
Arlington, at 817-264-4920; or Emily Palmer, TDH Office of Communications,
Austin, at 512-458-7400.
