A mystery disease has damaged the standing mustard crop in [parts of] Sangrur District. Fearing damage in other areas in coming days, the Agriculture Department has started efforts to contain the disease spread. "I have taken 13 acres on lease and sown mustard on it. But for the last 10 days, plants have been shriveling and not bearing any fruit. It's ripening time," said a farmer. The shriveling of mustard has given tension to other farmers, who have demanded quick action to prevent the spread of the mystery disease. "If the disease spreads, it will cause more heavy losses," said another farmer

Senior Agriculture Department officers disclosed that after getting information about damage to the crop, a team visited [the] field. They examined the 13 acres and have put the crop under observation to ascertain the nature of the disease. "We have been taking the required steps. The attack has been in patches. Our teams are also visiting other villages of the district and getting feedback whether the residents are facing a similar problem," said [the] Chief Agriculture Officer, Sangrur.

[Cropping mustards include a range of species in the genera _Brassica_ and _Sinapis_ (family Brassicaceae). It can be affected by a number of diseases, several of them due to fungi, but some also to due to viruses and bacteria. Most of these pathogens can also infect other brassicas which include many cultivated vegetables and wild weed species. Hence, pathogen reservoirs are rife and disease management for brassica crops can be challenging.

Reliable diagnosis is needed to determine if the problem is indeed due to an infectious agent, caused by external factors or during cultivation. Only then will it be possible to design effective management strategies for the farmers above.
