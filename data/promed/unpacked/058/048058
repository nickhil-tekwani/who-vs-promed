----------------------------------------------------------------------
Stem (black) rust, caused by _Puccinia graminis_ Pers. f. sp.
_tritici_ Eriks. & Henn., is one of the most destructive diseases of
wheat. It could be controlled through introgression of race-specific
resistance genes. However, such resistance is mostly short lived due
to emergence of new virulences. For example, resistance genes Sr11,
Sr24, Sr30, and Sr31 are no longer effective. Detection of new
virulences has remained vital in the evaluation and identification of
new sources of resistance. We report here the detection of virulence
to Sr25, a gene from _Thinopyrum elongatum_, which had been effective
or partially effective against stem rust worldwide, including race Ug99.

A stem rust isolate collected in 2006 from Karnataka (southern India)
produced susceptible reactions on the primary leaves of differential
genotype 'Agatha' carrying Sr25 and susceptible check 'Agra Local'. To
verify virulence to Sr25, single-pustule isolates from this sample
were inoculated onto seedlings of 6 additional varieties which all
carry Sr25. All these accessions were found susceptible to this
isolate, except one, which expressed resistance, indicating the
presence of additional gene(s). These genotypes are resistant to
Sr25-avirulent pathotypes.

The new pathotype is avirulent to Sr11, 13, 14, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26,
27, 29, 31, 32, 33, 35, 37, 38, 39, 40, 43, and Tmp and virulent to
Sr5, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 9a, 9b, 9d, 9e, 9f, 9g, 10, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18,
19, 20, 25, 28, 30, 34, 36, 42, Wld-1, and Gt. This pathotype has been
designated as 58G13-3 and PKTSC according to the Indian nomenclature
and the North American system, respectively. It represents race 40
based on Stakman's differentials [standard variety series to identify
stem rust pathotypes. - Mod.DHA] It may have arisen from race 40
through mutation. The type culture of the pathotype has been added to
the culture collection at Shimla [Himachal Pradesh, India].

The detection of Sr25 virulence is significant since Sr25 is an
important gene to be targeted for breeding wheat cultivars resistant
to Ug99. We should use either adult plant resistance and/or combining
two or more genes for seedling resistance to enhance the field life of
wheat cultivars.

[Wheat stem rust is caused by the fungus _Puccinia graminis_ f. sp.
_tritici_. Overall yield losses of up to 80 percent are reported, but
some fields are totally destroyed. New races are emerging, and the
most dangerous at present is strain Ug99, which has overcome the major
resistance gene Sr31 used in our current wheat varieties. An even more
virulent variant of Ug99 able to overcome the additional resistance
genes Sr24 and Sr36 has recently emerged in Kenya.

Rust spores are carried eastwards on prevailing winds, and regions at
high risk of a Ug99 incursion were identified accordingly in the
Middle East and South Asia. It is estimated that Ug99 could reduce
world wheat production by 60 million tons and the pathogen is
considered a global threat to food security. Resistance breeding
programmes have been set up with international cooperation (Delhi
Declaration, see link below) to establish wheat varieties resistant to
Ug99.
