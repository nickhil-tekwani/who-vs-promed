Rapid communications: Waterborne outbreak of acute gastroenteritis in
a coastal area in Slovenia, June-July 2008
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In June and July 2008, an outbreak of acute gastroenteritis with at
least 408 cases occurred in the municipality of Piran, Slovenia. The
town has 17 400 inhabitants and is located in a tourist area on the
Slovenian Adriatic coast. The 1st 20 cases were reported on 26 Jun
2008 to the regional Institute of Public Health Koper (IPH Koper).
Preliminary interviews indicated that the only common source of
exposure was the local water distribution system in Piran, which
supplies all inhabitants of the town. IPH Koper informed the local
water distribution company on the same day [26 Jun 2008], and control
measures for containing the outbreak were implemented immediately.

In June 2007, only 87 cases of acute gastroenteritis of infectious
etiology were notified to IPH Koper from the costal region of Koper
with 142 000 inhabitants (including the municipality of Piran). In
the whole year 2007, 1321 cases were reported in this region (between
75 and 167 cases per month).

Methods
-------
The following steps were taken in the course of the outbreak investigation:

Case finding and laboratory analysis of stool samples
-----------------------------------------------------
According to the law on communicable diseases, all cases of acute
gastroenteritis and outbreaks of communicable diseases in Slovenia
need to be reported indicating the causative agent. All general
practitioners and the regional hospital in the area were informed of
the outbreak and encouraged to report all cases of acute
gastroenteritis and to collect stool samples of cases. The samples
were tested for gastrointestinal bacteria (_Salmonella_, _Shigella_,
_Campylobacter_, _E. coli_, _Yersinia_), viruses (rotavirus,
adenovirus, norovirus) and parasites.

Risk assessment and analysis of drinking water
----------------------------------------------
A risk assessment of the drinking water distribution system and
laboratory testing of the water were systematically undertaken in the
affected area (Piran). Water samples were tested for _E. coli_,
coliform bacteria, enterococci, _Clostridium perfringens_, and the
total number of colonies at 22 deg C [71.6 deg F] and 37 deg C [98.6
deg F].

Retrospective cohort study
--------------------------
A retrospective cohort study was conducted. Our aim was to estimate
the magnitude of the event and to test the hypothesis that the
drinking water from the distribution system was the source of
infection. The information was collected by questionnaires. Because
the exact number of exposed people in Piran was impossible to
determine with many visitors staying only for the day, the
investigation targeted the 1470 households in the area of Piran. 4
questionnaires were posted to each household, 5880 questionnaires
altogether. The questions covered demographic data, disease symptoms,
and epidemiological data with an emphasis on exposure to drinking
water from the water distribution system.

A case was defined as any person that stayed in Piran on and after 19
Jun 2008 and developed one of the following symptoms: diarrhea,
vomiting, or abdominal pain. The collected data were analyzed using
EpiInfo 3.3.5 and SPSS 13.0 software.

Results
-------
Case finding and laboratory analysis of stool samples
-----------------------------------------------------
By 1 Aug 2008, 170 cases of acute gastroenteritis that could be
connected with the outbreak had been reported by health services. All
had developed symptoms between 25 Jun 2008 and 11 Jul 2008.
Laboratory analysis of stool samples was conducted for 43 reported
cases (25.3 percent). 26 samples were negative and 17 were positive.
The microbiological agents identified in the positive samples are
shown in Table 1 [the table can be seen in the source URL but
included 6 cases of _Staphylococcus aureus_ bacteria or toxin, 3
cases of campylobacterosis, 3 cases of norovirus, 2 of rotavirus, and
cases of _Bacillus cereus_ and _Giardia_. - Mod.LL]

Risk assessment and analysis of drinking water
----------------------------------------------
All water samples taken from the local distribution system in the
area of Piran on 26 Jun 2008 showed fecal contamination. The values
for all tested bacteria were above the recommended limits. It was
assumed that the water had been contaminated the night between 23 and
24 Jun [2008], when the water supply system in this area was
connected to a newly built part of the system. Measures were taken to
clean up the water distribution system in the area: the degree of
contamination was followed up daily, starting on 26 Jun [2008]. On 15
Jul [2008], the 2 consecutive water samples were negative and the
water was again suitable for drinking.

Retrospective cohort study
--------------------------
Until 1 Aug 2008 we received 624 completed questionnaires, of which
408 (65.4 percent) met the case definition. Characteristics of the
cohort and the cases are shown in Table 2 [the table can be found at
the source URL. - Mod.LL]

The epidemic curve (Figure 1 [see source URL]) showed a clear peak in
the number of cases with the onset of illness on 26 Jun 2008 and
suggests a common source exposure. Onset of symptoms for 90 percent
of cases was between 24 Jun and 3 Jul 2008. Their geographical
distribution is shown in Figure 2 [see source URL. - Mod.LL]

The mean duration of illness was 2.7 days (range up to 5 days). 130
cases (31.9 percent) sought medical advice, 16 cases (3.9 percent)
were hospitalized, none died.

The data analysis showed that people who drank only water from the
water distribution system after 23 Jun 2008 had a higher attack rate
(76.4 percent) for developing disease in contrast to those who also
drank water from other sources (attack rate 52.5 percent). Drinking
bottled water was a protective factor.

Public health measures for containing the outbreak
--------------------------------------------------
From 26 Jun to 15 Jul 2008, the following public health measures were
in place in the affected areas of Piran:
- inhabitants were advised not to drink water from local distribution system;
- inhabitants were advised to use only boiled water for cooking and
washing fruits and vegetables;
- instructions for boiling of the water were distributed to each household;
- uncontaminated drinking water (bottled water and water from water
tanks) was distributed in the affected area with the help of the
civil protection and the fire department. The water tanks were
organized in the main square. Senior inhabitants had bottled water
delivered to their homes.

Discussion and conclusions
--------------------------
The described outbreak of acute gastroenteritis in Piran started on
24 Jun and ended on 11 Jul 2008. 2 percent of cases from the
retrospective cohort study reported onset of illness before 24 Jun
2008. It is possible that part of these cases can be attributed to
recall bias, as the study started only on 10 Jul 2008. Another part
may be attributable to infection from a different source and to other
medical conditions, as the case definition was quite broad.

The peak in the onset of illness on 26 Jun 2008 suggests a common
source of exposure. The somewhat tailed distribution of the cases in
the epidemic curve can be due to the following probable causes:

- some of the isolated causative agents can be transmitted also
through human-to-human contact (calicivirus, rotavirus, adenovirus);

- as seen also by other authors, there was a problem with informing
the consumers about the contamination of the drinking water, and the
information about how to boil the drinking water was not sufficiently
adopted (1);

- some of the isolated agents have a longer incubation period
(_Giardia lamblia_) (2);

- some of the cases could have been infected by a different source.

The number of cases identified in the retrospective cohort study was
2.4-fold higher than the number reported cases by physicians. We
assume that many cases did not seek medical attention. In addition,
there is a continuous problem of underreporting of communicable
diseases by physicians in Slovenia in general. The response rate in
the retrospective cohort study was very low. One reason could be that
the questionnaires were sent to households, not to individuals, and
the exact number of inhabitants of each household was not known.
Another possible reason is that ill people are more likely to have
responded than people that were not ill.

All known cases were local inhabitants. Because Piran is a well-known
summer holiday destination for foreign and Slovenian tourists, it is
possible that the number of cases reported by the physicians and the
number of cases identified through the retrospective cohort study
(only inhabitants were included) underestimate the real extent of the
outbreak.

According to the results of outbreak investigation, retrospective
cohort study, and microbiological analysis of drinking water and
stool samples, we conclude that the source of this outbreak was most
probably contaminated drinking water from the local water
distribution system. We assume that the water was contaminated the
night between 23 and 24 Jun 2008, when the water supply system in
this area was disturbed due to the establishment of a new connection.
Unauthorized interventions to the water supply system have been done
by some inhabitants in the past, and it is likely that differences in
pressures in the system appeared when the new system was connected,
which resulted in a connection with the sewage system.

In the outbreak, different pathogens were isolated from stool samples
of patients. This is common in outbreaks caused by contamination of
drinking water by sewage water. Several similar outbreaks in the USA
in 2003/2004 were caused by different pathogens (3). Between 1997 and
2007, 20 waterborne outbreaks were notified in Slovenia, with between
5 and 181 cases reported in each outbreak. More than half of those
outbreaks were caused by contamination of drinking water from water
supply systems. In 12 outbreaks where the causative agent was
identified, the following agents were isolated: astrovirus,
calicivirus, _Cryptosporidium parvum_, _E. coli_, hepatitis A virus,
rotavirus, and _Shigella sonnei_ (4).
