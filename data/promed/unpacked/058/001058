In recent days, the health authorities in Tunisia have recorded an increase in the number of infections with the shigella bacterium (_Shigella sonnei_), which has reappeared, especially among children, in several regions of the country, years after its disappearance. Symptoms of infection with [this] gastrointestinal tract germ: sometimes severe and bloody diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, fever, and nausea. The germ is transmitted by touching sick people or consuming contaminated water.

In this regard, the specialist in virology, Dr Abdel Halim Trabelsi, said in statements to Sky News Arabia: "_Shigella_ is a bacterium that infects the digestive system and causes diarrhea. It was widespread in the 1980s and 1990s in Tunisia, before it was absent for years. It was considered a serious disease that causes dehydration in children, serious health complications, and death. The improvement of living conditions, especially the quality of water, has led to a significant decline in it, especially as it is transmitted through polluted water or vegetables and crops irrigated with polluted water."

Why did the germ return to Tunisia? To answer this question, the virologist explained: "_Shigella_ reappeared in Tunisia about a month ago, as laboratories recorded more than 200 cases in a number of governorates, most of them among children, but the infection was also transmitted to some elderly people. The level of risk for those infected with the bacteria who are undergoing treatment is not high, and it is treated with antibiotics, but they have noticed that it has become very resistant to drugs and antibiotics, compared to what it was years ago. It is likely that the germ that transmitted the infection was imported, because the cases that were monitored in Tunisia were easier to treat with antibiotics."

"_Shigella_ [infection] comes due to pollution, and it is transmitted through touch, and the level of infection with it is classified as mild at the present time," according to Trabelsi. "The germ does not cause intractable clinical difficulties, but it appears to be highly resistant to antibiotics and causes difficult complications, especially in the elderly who suffer from chronic diseases, and children under 5 years old. The germ cannot be resisted in the absence of a vaccine, except with cleanliness, especially clean drinking water, ... it is also spreading in European countries, because globalization has allowed ... the spread of infection among people."

The Tunisian Ministry of Health announced, in a statement, that "highly resistant infections have increased among children", stressing "the need to adhere to preventive measures to limit the spread of infection", by washing hands with soap and water frequently, especially before preparing food and after eating; ensuring that nails are trimmed and clean; disposing of infected children's diapers in closed bags and cleaning the surface well; not swimming until complete recovery; and disposing of household waste in a healthy way, on a daily basis.

[Of the 4 _Shigella_ species (_Shigella sonnei_, _S. flexneri_, _S. boydii_, and _S. dysenteriae_), _S. sonnei_ is the commonest species in the United States. Humans are the only reservoir for shigella, which are easily transmitted person-to-person because _Shigella_ are relatively resistant to gastric acidity, and only a few (10-100) organisms, if swallowed, will survive passage through the stomach and be sufficient to establish infection in the lower intestinal tract.

The organisms are spread via hands, mouth, food, or water that have come into contact with the stool of a person infected with _Shigella_. Although shigellosis is usually self-limited in 5-7 days without antibiotic treatment, antibiotics are commonly used to decrease fecal excretion of the organism that may otherwise last up to several weeks and for severe cases that have prolonged dysentery or sepsis. However, resistance to antimicrobials has restricted treatment options.

In 2015, ProMED posted a report of an outbreak of multidrug-resistant (MDR) _Shigella sonnei_ in the USA, affecting more than 300 people, that appeared to have been repeatedly imported by international travel in men who have sex with men (MSM) (ProMED post Shigellosis - USA (03): travel, MSM, antimicrobial resistance 20151021.3732921). In 2016, ProMED posted a report of a single clone, based on whole genome sequencing (WGS), widespread in South Asia, that was likely driving an intercontinental surge of ciprofloxacin-resistant _S. sonnei_ cases (ProMED post Shigellosis, antimicrobial-resistant - South Asia: spread 20160904.4464085). Then, in 2019, ProMED reported an outbreak between March and November 2018 in the UK of 17 cases of shigellosis caused by a multidrug-resistant (MDR) _Shigella_ clone, based on WGS, that clustered among MSM; 9 further cases were identified in the USA (ProMED post Shigellosis - UK: multiresistant, MSM 20190128.6279377 and https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/769163/SHGLL-SONN_2018275.pdf).

Resistance markers in this clone included blaCTX-M-27, which encodes an extended-spectrum Î²-lactamase (ESBL), a single gyrA mutation associated with reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones and the macrolide resistance markers erm(B) and mph(A). Consequently, treatment of infections caused by this MDR strain with fluoroquinolones, azithromycin, and ceftriaxone is unlikely to be effective. TMP/SMX had been one of the drugs of choice for the treatment of shigellosis, but emerging resistance to this antimicrobial drug limited its empiric use (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3462054/).

We are not told in the news report above the antimicrobial susceptibility of the strain of _S. sonnei_ causing the outbreak in Tunisia. More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
