A husband & wife have been admitted to St. John's Hospital in Jackson,
Wyoming. Both have been diagnosed with Legionnaire's disease, a potentially
fatal, virulent form of pneumonia, probably contracted at a hotel in Reno,
Nevada, during a convention of veterans of the US submarine service. Nine
other participants are ill with similar symptoms.
This disease is caused by water vapor borne bacteria, usually found in bad
HVAC [air conditioning systems and warm water, such as showers, jacuzzies,
pools, etc. The hotel flushes its toilets with warm water, another potential
source.
