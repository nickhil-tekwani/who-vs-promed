That was a very critical question you asked about rabies post-exposure
prophylaxis as immunoglobulins are required according to WHO guidelines of
rabies post-exposure prophylaxis in any single or multiple transdermal
rabies prone wound and have to be instilled in the wound.
There are two issues concerning rabies immunoglobulins: affordability and
availability.
99% of post-exposure treatments which occur in developing countries would
not contain immunoglobulins. I can mention only about my experiences in
Pakistan. The two types human derived and equine derived with an immense
cost difference:
Cost in US $ (days of work by clerk)
Human Rabies immunoglobulin(HRIG) 5 ml=2000 I.U (20 IU/kg) 293 (100)
Equine rabies immunoglobulin (ERIG) 10 ml=2000 I.U (40 IU/Kg) 35 (12)
The cost of ERIG is 8-10 times less than HRIG. For a 50 kg person ERIG would
cost him Pak Rs.1,256 as compared to Human Rabies immunogloblin would cost
around Pak Rs.18,747.
I feel the problems here are 1. HRIG is too expensive as dog bites afflict
the indigent population. 2. Physicians don't know much about the importance
and safety of ERIG.
Immunoglobulins would be available in big cities at their suppliers store or
at tertiary care private hospitals here. This would usually be HRIG because
physicians fear anaphylaxis due to ERIG. This fear is unjustified especially
of the new products (Rabies antiserum produced by Pasteur Merieux Connaught,
France and Swiss & Serum Institute, Berne, Switzerland) which are safe. The
chances of anaphylaxis is 1 in 40,000 and even then its preventable shown in
studies published 10 years ago in Thailand.
There are also economic disincentives and animal right activism against ERIG
production in the West. Countries like Thailand and China in Asia are
producing their own ERIG to some extent. Hence production of safe equine
immunoglobulin needs to be increased in Third World Countries and its use
has to promoted among physicians. You would find numerous publications on
Rabies Immunoglobulins coming from Thailand by Dr. Henry Wilde at Queen
Saovobha Memmorial Institute, Bangkok.
The vaccine and regimen is being used in Zambia is important. Are the wounds
being cleaned promptly and thoroughly by soap and water? Dried and applied
with tincture of iodine or 60-80% ethanol? These steps might be life saving
as they may decrease the viral inoculum and kill the virus and might be
neglected by victims, primary care providers and physicians themselves.

>From experience, I doubt it! I do not think that anyone would find RIG in
our public health institutions. Post exposure treatment in Zambia
especially, is usually composed of anti tetanus, antibiotics (if the bite
wound is severe) and post-exposure vaccination.

WHO reports that over 90% of subjects exposed to rabies and given some form
of post exposure vaccine therapy do not receive RIG (WHO/Rabies 94.210,
Geneva). In Southeast and South Asia this is also the case except for
Thailand where the National Blood Center of the Thai Red Cross manufactures
HRIG and some ERIG is also being made locally as well as imported.
Human RIG (HRIG) is simply not affordable if purchased from abroad. It
Thailand it costs the equivalent of 100 days of labor for an low level civil
servant. In the other Asian countries it is even worse.
The new Equine RIG made in Europe and in small amounts in Thailand is
highly purified and carries a 1-1.5% serum sickness rate and only 1:40,000
cases had anaphylaxis. There is not enough of it worldwide (see: Wilde, H ,
Ann Int Med 1996;125: 233-236).
How effective is rabies vaccine alone in a true exposure? We do not know
exactly as it depends on many factors such as viral inoculum, where (near
nerve endings) etc. We do know, however, that vaccination even with the new
tissue culture vaccines will not give a "protective" AB response before day
10-14. We have seen deaths here in less time.
Our group also feels that the RIG is only effective if injected into the
bite sites. Given IM elsewhere does not result in much more than a barely
detectable systemic antibody response. Recent studies by J. Lang, A
Subcharoen and E. Miranda (In print) have worked out the kinetics of RIG
administration and confirm our long held impression that this is so.
Manufacturers of ERIG have closed down plants partly due to the low
profitability of this product used mostly in poor countries and also due to
pressure from animal rights groups who do not like horses to be used as
blood donors. If you wish to know more, read the WHO document and paper in
Annals referenced above.

I recently spent 4 years in Zambia and Eritrea. While I don't know about
RIG availability in Zambia, I found it unavailable in Eritrea. When my wife
was trying to provide PEP to several individuals who had been bitten by a
rabid dog, we could only find it at the US Embassy. No local sources for
RIG were found but fortunately the US Embassy allowed their supply to be
used and replaced as an emergency measure.

[RIG appears not to be available in the developing world. As this is the
holiday season for some of us, I always try to count my blessings. One of
the things I love about this job is you never know what response you will
get if you ask our participants a question. Sometimes nothing. But in this
case, look at what we got from just a one line question! Many thanks to all
who contributed and happy holidays to all. - Mod.PC
