Next step in smallpox effort: drug for vaccine side effects
----------------------------
MARIETTA, GA: Smallpox vaccine -- made from vaccinia, a cousin to smallpox
that is grown in cows -- is among the most dangerous of vaccines. It often
produces temporary fevers and sore, swollen arms. In a small but
unpredictable number of cases, however, the vaccinia pox itself runs wild
and leaves its victims scarred, blinded, or sometimes even dead.
The only tested antidote is vaccinia immune globulin (VIG), but until this
month, the United States had only 600 to 700 doses. The antidote must be
made from the blood of people vaccinated in the last 2 months, while a
flood tide of newly minted antibodies is coursing through their veins.
Until recently, there were only a handful of potential donors.
Routine smallpox vaccinations for children stopped in 1972, and the
military stopped in the late 1980s, so the only ones with current
vaccinations were laboratory technicians working with the world's remaining
stocks of smallpox or related viruses.
Now, after hastily signing up two companies to make more, the US
government, which may vaccinate up to 500 000 health workers and 500 000
people in the military, is opening up this bottleneck a bit. By the year's
end, the government should have about 5000 doses of VIG in hand.
Theoretically, that would be enough to allow at least 40 million people to
be vaccinated. Making enough to vaccinate all 280 million Americans safely
could take 2 years, based on the most pessimistic estimates of need. But no
one knows exactly how much is needed because experts do not know how many
bad reactions will occur or how effective efforts will be to screen out the
people most likely to have them -- pregnant women, people with compromised
immune systems, and people with a history of eczema or other rashes.
In 1968, two separate studies found one life threatening reaction per 67
000 vaccinations and one per 20 000. But in 1968, far fewer Americans had
immune systems weakened by AIDS, cancer chemotherapy, or organ transplants,
and eczema was less common.
The military's supplier said it was told to assume one serious reaction per
8000 vaccinations. Asked about that, Dr Raymond A Strikas, an
epidemiologist working on smallpox vaccination protocols for the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said, "Given the uncertainties
here, that may not be a bad estimate."
VIG is no miracle drug. It was invented in the 1950s and never tested in
rigorous clinical studies. Case surveys from the 1960s suggest that it can
cut deaths from severe vaccination eczema by two thirds and stop the spread
of new sores. But it seemed to have no effect on vaccinia necrosum, in
which tissue around the site dies in ever-enlarging circles. The condition,
rare in the 1960s, can kill immunosuppressed people, whose numbers have
grown sharply. VIG also seemed not to help brain inflammation complications.
But the government wants more because "you don't have anything else," said
Dr Anthony S Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases. Dr Fauci said the government was investigating
cidofovir, a drug licensed for use against another virus. But it would be
reserved for the most severe cases if VIG failed. Cidofovir is toxic and
untested against vaccinia in humans.
The 2 companies that received rush VIG orders were the DynPort Vaccine
Company of Frederick, MD, which has a longstanding contract to supply
vaccines for smallpox, botulism, plague, anthrax, and tularemia to the
military, and the Cangene Corporation of Winnipeg, Canada, which makes
antibody products that protect babies with dangerous Rhesus mismatches,
pregnant women exposed to chickenpox, and people exposed to anthrax and
hepatitis B.
DynPort had a head start, and has not yet needed to recruit donors because
it has a large stockpile of frozen plasma from soldiers vaccinated years
ago, said Dr David Smith, DynPort's principal scientist. The plasma is
tested for HIV, hepatitis, and other pathogens, and is then "fractionated"
using a combination of ethanol and salt concentrations to yield a few drops
of antibodies, which are proteins. DynPort has produced enough VIG to treat
660 severe reactions, Dr Smith said. Dr David Clanton, a DynPort senior
scientist, said the company had tested its new antidote on volunteers and
found that even a dose 5 times as great as normal produced "no adverse
effects."
Cangene, by contrast, has a bigger contract but a less urgent time frame.
It is to produce up to 100 000 doses for the United States civilian
population over 5 years. Lacking a pool of frozen plasma, it is seeking
about 10 000 volunteers to be inoculated for smallpox and then bled twice a
week for 2 months. Plasma is spun off their blood and their red cells are
returned to them. The plasma goes to Winnipeg, where Cangene uses a newer
chromatography process, pouring it through layers of beads that filter out
everything but the antibodies. Other purification steps are added,
including solvents that destroy the lipid shells of viruses like HIV or
West Nile virus.
To find all those donors, Cangene subcontracts several "specialty plasma"
companies. The Serologicals Corporation, a 32 year old company with
headquarters in Norcross, GA, is the biggest, with 13 clinics in 7 states
drawing blood from people "stimulated" with injections to produce
antibodies to rabies, hepatitis, mononucleosis, or herpes. So far, it has
found 1300 VIG donors through advertising and word of mouth. All donors
must have been vaccinated against smallpox as children, and have the scars
as proof. They are screened for all diseases that disqualify blood donors,
and for skin problems. No donors have yet had bad reactions, said Dr
Barbara Slade, medical director of Serologicals. Each is paid $100 a week,
but 4 donors interviewed in Marietta said money was not a factor.
Because touching the vaccination site or the bandage can infect someone
else with the vaccinia virus, potential donors cannot live with anyone at
high risk for complications -- anyone pregnant, under 1 year old, with
unexplained rashes, or with a weakened immune system. The donors are given
waterproof bandages. To change them, they must wear latex gloves, bag them,
and return them to the plasma center.

Prior ProMED-mail postings discussing the smallpox vaccination strategies
in the USA and the known hazards of the vaccine (references below) have
pointed out the current shortage of vaccine immune globulin (VIG) that
might preclude the implementation of vaccination activities. According to
this newswire report, efforts are now under way to address the recognized
shortage of VIG. - Mod.MPP]
