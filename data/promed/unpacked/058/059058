The deadly encephalitis has claimed 103 lives since January this year [2018], while hundreds of patients are undergoing treatment at Baba Roghav Das Medical College [Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh/UP] official sources said on [Sun 12 Aug 2018].

They said that in 2014 until August, 249 had died; in 2015 the numbers were 135; in 2016 it was 200; and last year [2018], 182 patients had died til August.

Sources said that the number of patients was increasing gradually while there was a shortage of doctors and paramedical staff in Medical College Hospital.

Patients not only from eastern UP but also from Nepal come for treatment in the Medical College Hospital.

[The etiology of the deaths of the 103 individuals with encephalitis is not mentioned. Usually these encephalitis cases are attributed to Japanese encephalitis (JE) as a minority of cases, with acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) of unspecified etiology for the majority. This is the season for JE virus, but AES also occurs at this time. Uttar Pradesh state is endemic for Japanese encephalitis virus, with cases occurring every year. As noted in many earlier posts, the determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive. Various etiological agents have been proposed in recent years as responsible for AES cases. AES has continued to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, lychee fruit consumption, and scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_).

It is odd that no mention is made of JE vaccination in the report above.
