A 4-year-old quarter horse from a private facility in Volusia County has been confirmed with eastern equine encephalitis (EEE).

The unvaccinated horse showed signs of inability to stand, incoordination, and weakness of hind limbs earlier this month [January 2021]and was euthanized.

This is the 1st confirmed case of EEE in Florida for 2021.

[While eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) crops up every year, especially in unvaccinated animals, this is exceptionally early. It is still January. Even in the warmer southern states, this is extremely early.

It appears this may be a year of early vaccination and likely continual vaccination. EEE vaccine is often combined with Western equine encephalitis and tetanus. Sometimes there is also Venezuelan equine encephalitis in the vaccine (VEWT). Some vaccines are missing the Venezuelan portion but have West Nile virus instead. And some vaccines have all of these. Please consult your veterinarian as to what is recommended in your area.

However, EEE is one where protection wanes the earliest. Revaccinating every 3-4 months with EEE is necessary in areas where mosquitoes are most prevalent. - Mod.TG
