A 46-year-old public health physician resident in Abuja, Nigeria, who
was involved in an immunization campaign in Jalingo village, Taraba
State, Nigeria, in January 2007, became ill on 6 Feb [2007]. On 10
Feb 2007 he was admitted to the National Hospital Abuja, where he
presented with abdominal tenderness and fever; mildly elevated liver
enzymes; leucopenia and thrombocytopenia were also noted. Malaria and
viral hepatitis were ruled out. He became afebrile after 4 days of
antibiotic treatment, but on 15 Feb [2007] presented with vomiting,
generalized tonic-clonic convulsion, petechial hemorrhages on upper
trunk, bleeding from vena puncture sites, and confusion. Two days
later due to renal failure he was treated with emergency
hemodialysis. On 19 Feb[2007] he was medically evacuated from Nigeria
to a hospital in Pretoria, South Africa. Lassa fever was suspected,
and blood specimens were sent to the Special Pathogens Unit of the
National Institute for Communicable Diseases on 20 Feb 2007, where
Lassa virus infection was confirmed by RT-PCR (reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction) and serology.
Transmission of Lassa virus from its natural rodent reservoir to
humans can cause hemorrhagic fever syndrome, which is associated with
high death rates. Lassa fever is endemic in West Africa and has been
reported from Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia, and Nigeria. Only a few
cases of importation of Lassa virus into other regions have been
documented worldwide. Although importation of a Lassa fever case
raises public concern because of the possibility of human-to-human
transmission and lack of an effective and safe therapy, the actual
risk for infection spread from an imported case appears to be low.
The Lassa fever patient admitted to a hospital in Pretoria is
currently being treated in isolation. He is ill, but stable. South
African health authorities have taken all necessary measures to
prevent transmission of the virus. Medical personnel in contact with
the patient are under observation although no specific incidents
constituting overt exposure to infection have been recorded. Medical
authorities in Nigeria and WHO have been informed of the case.

[Excerpts from the US CDC Special Pathogens Branch fact sheet on
Lassa Fever
(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/lassaf.htm>
provide the following information [edited]:
"In areas of Africa where the disease is endemic (that is, constantly
present), Lassa fever is a significant cause of morbidity and
mortality. While Lassa fever is mild or has no observable symptoms in
about 80 percent of people infected with the virus, the remaining 20
percent have a severe multisystem disease. Lassa fever is also
associated with occasional epidemics, during which the case-fatality
rate can reach 50 percent.
"Lassa fever is an endemic disease in portions of West Africa. It is
recognized in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, as well as Nigeria.
However, because the rodent species that carry the virus are found
throughout West Africa, the actual geographic range of the disease
may extend to other countries in the region.
"The number of Lassa virus infections per year in West Africa is
estimated at 100 000 to 300 000, with approximately 5000 deaths.
Unfortunately, such estimates are crude, because surveillance for
cases of the disease is not uniformly performed. In some areas of
Sierra Leone and Liberia, it is known that 10-16 percent of people
admitted to hospitals have Lassa fever, which indicates the serious
impact of the disease on the population of this region."
