Rift Valley Fever Kills 44 Yemenis in 48 Hours
----------------------------------------------
SAN'A, Yemen: - Rift Valley fever has killed 44 people in north Yemen during
the past 48 hours, bringing the death toll from this mosquito-borne virus to
122 in only a matter of days, a Health Ministry official said on Sat 23 Sep.
2000. The official said 23 people died in Wadi Mour and another 21 in the
adjoining northern region of Hajjah.
The virus is transmitted from livestock to humans by mosquitoes and causes
diarrhea, nausea, and internal bleeding that can result in death.
Neighboring Saudi Arabia has reported 16 deaths from Rift Valley Fever in
its southern region near the border with the Yemen over the last 2 weeks.
At the San'a government's request, Saudi aircraft sprayed the affected areas
in Yemen this week with anti-mosquito insecticides.
Jordan, which lies north of Saudi Arabia, is currently fumigating against
mosquitoes in towns and villages and at cattle farms, slaughterhouses and
waste dumps. Jordanian health officials say neither Rift Valley nor West
Nile fever have been reported in the Kingdom, but 13 people have died in
neighboring Israel of the West Nile disease, a similar mosquito-borne virus.

[Unrelated arthropod-borne viruses are responsible for Rift Valley fever and
West Nile Fever. Rift Valley fever virus is classified as a member of the
genus _Phlebovirus_ of the family _Bunyaviridae_, whereas West Nile virus
belongs to the genus _Flavivirus_ of the family _Flaviviridae_. West Nile
virus is maintained in a mosquito-bird-mosquito cycle, involving
predominantly _Culex_ spp. mosquitoes, and only rarely causes a fatal
encephalitis in humans. Rift Valley fever virus, on the other hand, is one
of the most important veterinary pathogens, and it has been responsible for
epidemics of severe often haemorrhagic human disease. Apart from the
severity of the associated disease, Rift Valley fever virus is the greater
hazard because it has the potential to be transmitted without the
involvement of an arthropod vector, and also to survive transovarially,in
arthropods. - Mod.CP
