Influenza update number 348 (based on data up to 4 Aug 2019)
-------------------------------------------------------------
Information in this report is categorized by influenza transmission zones, which are geographical groups of countries, areas or territories with similar influenza transmission patterns.

Summary
-------
- In the temperate zones of the southern hemisphere, influenza activity appeared to have peaked in most countries.
- In the Caribbean, Central American, and tropical South American countries, influenza activity was low overall.
- In tropical Africa, influenza activity was low across reporting countries, with the exception of a few countries in Eastern Africa.
- In Southern Asia, influenza activity was low across reporting countries.
- In South East Asia, influenza activity was decreasing or low across reporting countries except in Myanmar.
- In the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere, influenza activity remained at inter-seasonal levels.
- Worldwide, seasonal influenza A viruses accounted for the majority of detections.

National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 95 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from 22 Jul 2019 to 4 Aug 2019 (data as of 16 Aug 2019 03:18:28 UTC). The WHO GISRS [Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System] laboratories tested more than 42 723 specimens during that time period. 3660 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 2340 (63.9 percent) were typed as influenza A and 1320 (36.1 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 661 (38.9 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 1038 (61.1 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 59 (7.9 percent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 687 (92.1 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

From 1 Jan to 16 Aug 2019, 544 people were confirmed to have H1N1 infection and 96 of them died, according to the Ministry of Health and Sports.

Among those deaths, the highest deaths were recorded in Yangon region, with 66 deaths. There were also 12 deaths in Ayeyarwady region, 7 in Bago region, 3 in Sagaing region, 2 from Magway region, and one each from Kachin, Rakhine, and (south) Shan states.

Most of these deaths were found to have underlying diseases such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and heart diseases.

In 2018, over 300 people were found to have H1N1 influenza infection. However, no deaths were identified. In 2017, more than 30 deaths out of over 400 confirmed cases were recorded.

[3] India (Maharashtra): H1N1
Date: Tue 20 Aug 2019

Another 5 people have succumbed to swine flu [influenza A/H1N1] in the state [Maharashtra] over the past 2 weeks, taking the number of such deaths to 197 this year [2019], so far, while as many as 2101 people have tested positive for H1N1.

Health experts say the change in climate, global travelling patterns, the transfer of viruses from one place to another, and the possibility of an antigenic shift in viruses are the major causes for the increase in the number of influenza cases this year [2019].

"The active transmission of the virus is not limited to cities anymore. Rural parts of the state, such as Satara, Solapur, Dhule, Jalgaon, Latur, and Buldhana [districts] have also started reporting positive cases and casualties," said a health official.

In urban areas, Pune, Nagpur, Nashik, Mumbai, and Kolhapur have collectively recorded 146 H1N1 deaths. Besides, the Municipal Corporation of Aurangabad has recorded 9 deaths, followed by the civic bodies of Ahmednagar (8), Thane (5), Kalyan (5), and Pimpri Chinchwad (3).

Antigenic shift is explained as a major change in the influenza virus, occurring typically when a human flu virus crosses with a flu virus that usually affects animals (such as birds or pigs). When the viruses mutate, they shift to create a new subtype that is different from any seen in humans before.

Experts said diminished immunity among masses and the co-circulation of other seasonal viruses along with [influenza A/H1N1], are other contributive factors. The wide fluctuation in day and night temperatures is conducive to the spread of the virus.

"Minute changes in the temperature affect the transmission dynamics of a virus. When the temperature is low, the virus remains suspended in air and this leads to a rise in [influenza A/H1N1] cases," said Abhay Chowdhary, the former director of the Parel-based Haffkine Institute.

Doctors said there are far more mutated virus strains this year [2019], as compared to the previous year [2018], leading to an increased number of cases. "The 2 main groups of influenza virus that we see are H1N1 and influenza A.

Influenza B virus is spreading fast and there is definitely a very severe strain that was missing in the previous years [2018]," said Dr Om Srivastava, infectious diseases specialist, Jaslok Hospital.

Private practitioners confirmed a rise in H1N1 cases and seeing 3 patients daily on average. "We continue to see 4-5 new cases of H1N1 every week. There are more patients this year [2019]. Patients in the high-risk group are being put on Tamiflu immediately," said doctors in Mumbai.

[As per the news report above, 2101 cases and 197 people had died due to influenza A(H1N1) in Maharashtra state so far in 2019. To prevent further transmission of the disease in the community, it is necessary to maintain respiratory and hand hygiene and stay at home during the illness https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/respiratory/respiratory-tract/swine-flu. -Mod.UBA]

The national death toll officially stands at 430, although the real figure could be much higher with experts saying some deaths are attributed to other causes despite flu-related complications.

In Queensland this year [2019], at least 84 people have died. Jianyun Lu, has travelled from China to study the unusual flu season under the tutelage of the University of Queensland's, Kirsty Short.

They have discovered a slight association with climatic factors, but not enough to account for the large spike. "We can't explain 100 per cent why, when it's over 25 degrees Celsius [77 deg F], we have a very sharp increase," Dr Lu said.

So they have turned their attention to the virus itself.

There was an unusual number of children hospitalised with flu over summer [2018-19] and it's the strains isolated from those patients that the researchers have under the microscope.

Dr Short said they are investigating whether certain mutations were enabling the virus to "survive longer in the environment", or allowing it to "transmit better".

"By the end of the year [2019], I think we'll have a good understanding of potential factors that could have contributed to our unusual summer flu," Dr Short said.

Professor Barr identified a large outbreak in the Northern Territory at the end of last year [2018], and a mild-2018 influenza season as contributing factors and said there needed to be year-round surveillance.

"In Australia we rely on a number of different reporting mechanisms, so we can track influenza seasons. Some of these are run all year round, but a number of them, such as the surveillance in hospitals, only run from April to November," he said.

"We need to be better prepared. Maybe we can tweak the vaccination timings if we see these early outbreaks."

A record 12.5 million vaccines have been distributed so far this year [2019].
