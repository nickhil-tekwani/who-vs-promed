Fungus attacks strawberries in Viet Nam
---------------------------------------
Fungal infections have wiped out 60 per cent of strawberry plantations
around Da Lat City, province of Lam Dong. During the last 2 months, the
total area under strawberries has fallen from 100ha to 40ha. This has led
to a 50 per cent drop in productivity. The symptoms of the disease include
infected roots, withered plants and yellow leaves, said the director of the
Department of Plant Protection, Nguyen Van Son. According to the Institute
of Plant Protection, the fungi causing the disease are _Pythium_ spp. and
_Gloeosporium_ sp.

Pythium spp fungi live in the soil and infect the roots, preventing them
from taking up water and nutrition. _Gloeosporium_ sp fungus can
proliferate in wet weather, said Son. A farmer who owns a strawberry garden
[said that] half have died. "I have planted strawberries for 10 years, but
this is the 1st time they have been hit by the disease," he said.

Meanwhile, Son said his department planned to train farmers [in] proper
techniques for growing strawberry in cooperation with the Lam Dong
Agricultural Technology Centre. Farmers will be shown when and how to use
fertiliser and advice on proper drainage. After the course, the farmers
will be given substances to kill the fungi in soil.

[_Pythium_ fungi cause damping off, root rots, and blights leading to
serious problems in a wide variety of agricultural and horticultural crops.
In strawberry, _Pythium_ species are involved in the black root rot disease
complex, lilac soft rot and root rot (stunt). The fungi are soilborne and
can also be dispersed by water and mechanical means. Crop rotation is not
always effective in controlling _Pythium_ diseases because its effect on
pathogen populations can vary. Fungicides, seed treatments, biocontrol
agents, and use of resistant crop varieties may also be useful for disease
management. In Viet Nam, _Pythium_ species have been reported to occur on a
range of crops (see link below).

_Gloeosporium_ spp. (as well as _Colletotrichum_ spp.) have been reported
to be associated with anthracnose of strawberry. The disease can cause
lesions and rots of fruit, leaves and crown of strawberry plants, depending
on pathogen species or strain. The fungi survive on crop debris and spread
occurs mainly with infected plant material and by mechanical means. Disease
management may include removal of infected crop debris to reduce inoculum,
crop rotation, fungicides (although effectiveness may be limited),
biocontrol, and cultural measures.
