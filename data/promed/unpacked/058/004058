Nodding disease has been widely believed to affect children between 5 and 15 years old, but as cases are cited among adults, worry is rife that families who are unable to cater for their livelihoods will starve.

As the nodding disease syndrome previously notable among children takes its toll on adults, fears of a looming food shortage is rife among residents, who want the government to act fast and salvage livelihoods in Acholi-sub-region.

Nodding disease, which has, according to a WHO report, affected 7000 children, has subdued economic and domestic activities by parents, as most stay at home to take care of their sick children.

The situation is, however, more worrying now that cases of the disease are being cited among adults, with Kitgum Woman MP Beatrice Anwyar placing the figure at about 49.

A 40-year-old female resident of Tumangu village, Akwang Sub-county, Kitgum district has been suffering from nodding disease since 2009 and says that if the government does not provide for affected families, the situation will become more dire.

The HIV-positive mother, who lost her son in 2009 to nodding disease syndrome, says it has become impossible for her to look after her 5-year-old orphaned niece, also suffering from the ailment. "I cannot dig because I have no energy; it is just impossible. The government should provide food items to affected families," says the woman, who believes that nodding disease is contagious and says the government should isolate sick people from the community to avoid further spread and allow for special provisions for victims.

Ms Dorothy Akwero, a clinical officer in Palabek Gem, Pader district, recently put the number of adults affected by the nodding syndrome at 19 and expressed concern about how sick children will be attended to. She said it will be difficult for affected children to adhere to medication if their parents are affected.

A 63-year-old mother is another adult victim of nodding disease syndrome. The resident of Tumangu Ward, Akwang Sub-county says she started experiencing the symptoms 6 months ago. Although she says the medication she started taking a week ago has not had much impact on her health, her greatest worry is about how she will provide food to the 8 children under her care.

Dr Alex Layoo, the medical superintendent of Kitgum Hospital, says although cases of nodding disease in adults are being reported, no confirmation of the cases or the total number of people affected have been compiled.

"We don't know the complete behaviour of the disease, so we can't deny the problem in adults, he said on Saturday [19 May 2012] while speaking to a group of American researchers and a psychiatrist headed by MP Anywar.

Dr Layoo, however, agrees that the disease is affecting families immensely and emphasised the need for broad research to ascertain the cause and mode of spread of the disease.

"Do you expect a child [suffering from nodding disease] to grow up and continue with the family line," he wondered. "It is a big problem that is threatening the existence of families," he said of the nodding disease, which he called a medical insecurity.

[The WHO press release on nodding disease from 21 May 2012 can be found at: http://www.afro.who.int/en/media-centre/afro-feature/3590-hope-as-nodding-syndrome-screening-and-treatment-centres-are-opened-in-northern-uganda.html.

The etiology of the syndrome is still elusive. The occurrence of adult cases does not help point to the cause of the syndrome. It is suggested in the article that the condition is contagious, but that adult cases appear sometimes in the same households as pediatric cases can just as well point to a common exposure.

Toxicological investigations and autopsy studies are still pending. - Mod.EP
