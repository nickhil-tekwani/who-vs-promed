Acquisition of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae by healthy travellers to India, France, Feb 2012 to Mar 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Ruppe E, Armand-Lefevre L, Estellat C, El-Mniai A, Boussadia Y, Consigny PH, et al.

We report the acquisition of carbapenemases-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) in 3 healthy French travellers returning from India, who declared no contact with any local healthcare centres during their journey in this country.

As part of the VOYAG-R study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01526187), volunteers who had planned to travel to intertropical areas for a 3-day to 3-month trip were recruited in 6 centres for travel vaccinations in the Paris area, from February 2012 to March 2013. In total, 574 travellers (222 men and 352 women) were included, who visited 72 intertropical countries located in the Americas (n=183 travellers), Africa (n=195) or in the Middle East and south-east Asia (n=196). This included 57 travellers who visited India. If travelling in groups, only one self-designated volunteer was solicited. Included travellers were those with a negative stool sample for multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (MRE) during the week preceding departure and those who provided a stool sample within a week after their return. Each sample was accompanied with a self-completed questionnaire. Before departure the traveller informed on the dates of departure and return, the visited country, the number of accompanying travellers, the malaria prophylaxis, and the type and purpose of the travel. After return, the traveller reported on the occurrence of digestive disorders during the travel, the intake of antibiotics, any contact with the healthcare system at travel destination and the compliance with malaria prophylaxis. During the follow-up the traveller informed of any antibiotic intake and purpose, any hospitalisation and any new travel to intertropical countries. If positive for MRE after return, the traveller was asked to provide stool samples 1, 2, 3, 6 and 12 months after return, until no MRE could be detected. Among 57 travellers who had visited India, 3 returned to France with CPE intestinal carriage (Table).

Discussion and conclusion
-------------------------
MRE that produce ESBL and/or plasmid-encoded AmpC-type cephalosporinases (pAmpC) have spread massively in developing countries. This phenomenon likely results from suboptimal hygiene living conditions and uncontrolled antibiotic usage [4]. Therefore, travellers may be at risk for MRE acquisition when visiting countries in which the MRE prevalence is high. In recent years, studies focusing on the acquisition of MRE during travel abroad have shown that MRE acquisition rates ranged from 14.0 per cent to 30.5 per cent [5-10]. Surprisingly, in those studies no CPE was isolated from healthy travellers, despite them having visited CPE-endemic areas such as the Indian subcontinent. Some sporadic cases of CPE importation, with no connection with any healthcare centres, have been reported, all for travellers returning from India [11-13], but not healthy travellers.

We report the acquisition of CPE in 3 healthy French travellers returning from India, who declared no contact with any healthcare centres in this country. These findings are worrisome as they attest to the development of a community reservoir for CPE, at least in India.

The Indian subcontinent had already been identified as a major reservoir for antibiotic resistant bacteria, and CPE have been found in both seepage and tap water in the city of New Delhi [14]. In our study, we only found CPE in travellers returning from India. In 2010, 7.3 million citizens of the European Union travelled to India [15]. To deal with this issue, specific recommendations about the management of patients being repatriated, or patients who have recently (within less than 1 year) been hospitalised abroad, have been published by some European countries [16]. How these recommendations could extend to subjects who have recently travelled in CPE endemic areas may be discussed.

On a positive note, the duration of CPE carriage in the 3 travellers was less than one month. In former studies of acquisition of MRE by travellers, it was not clear whether the MRE carriage could be short [5] or long [7,9]. Despite the limited number of acquisitions of CPE, our results might suggest that, travellers immediately returning from CPE endemic areas should be considered as at risk for CPE carriage, while in the absence of antibiotic exposure, travellers at several months after their return might not pose such a risk.

Our results stress the need for a specific cultivation method for assessing the intestinal carriage of CPE when suspected, such as the one we used [1], because some CPE such as those producing OXA-48-type carbapenemases (including OXA-181) do not grow on agar media formulated to detect ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae [1]. Some CPE might have been missed in former studies because no specific and sensitive detection of CPE was used.

In conclusion, we report here the acquisition of CPE by healthy travellers to India without contact with any local healthcare centre, while in this country. In addition to repatriated patients or patients who have recently been hospitalised abroad, travellers may be considered at occasional risk for CPE carriage.

[A discussion of carbapenemases produced by Enterobacteriaceae can be found in moderator ML's comments in a prior ProMED-mail post: Enterobacteriaceae, carbapenem resistant - Europe: survey, archive no. 20130712.1822582.

Enterobacteriaceae are Gram negative bacilli, many of which are normal inhabitants of the lower intestinal tract of humans and other animals. These organisms are also common causes of community-acquired and health-care-acquired infections. Enterobacteriaceae include _Escherichia coli_, salmonella, shigella, _Yersinia pestis_, klebsiella, _Proteus_ spp, enterobacter, serratia, and citrobacter.

Carbapenem antibiotics are a group of beta-lactams that includes ertapenem, doripenem, imipenem, and meropenem. Carbapenems historically have been antibiotics of last resort to treat many infections due to carbapenem-sensitive, but otherwise multidrug-resistant Gram negative bacilli, such as those that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) or AmpC beta-lactamases, which are enzymes that destroy most beta-lactams, except the carbapenems.

Resistance to carbapenems in Enterobacteriaceae is complex; it can mediated by several different mechanisms, including production of enzymes that inactivate carbapenems (carbapenemases). Many of the carbapenemases are encoded on plasmids and other mobile genetic elements, pieces of DNA that can easily spread from one organism to another of the same or even different bacterial species in the gastrointestinal tract of humans and other animals and in the environment. These mobile pieces of DNA frequently carry genes that confer resistance to multiple other classes of antibiotics, so that organisms that have these resistance genes are susceptible only to a small number of toxic or otherwise suboptimal antibiotics.

_Klebsiella pneumoniae_ carbapenemases (KPCs) are enzymes encoded by a highly transmissible gene that were 1st identified in a _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ isolate from North Carolina in 2001. KPCs are now the most common carbapenemases in the US, but have also been reported worldwide. Additional carbapenemases have emerged among Enterobacteriaceae outside the US, including the New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase [NDM], which was 1st identified in a Swedish patient who had been previously hospitalized in India, IMP, VIM (Verona integron-encoded metallo-beta-lactamase), and OXA-types (oxacillin-hydrolyzing carbapenemases).

Enterobacteriaceae commonly cause infections in health care settings as well as in the community. Over the past decade, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae have been mainly recognized in health care settings as a cause of difficult-to-treat infections associated with high mortality. Infection control interventions for health care facilities have been developed to prevent transmission of these multi-drug resistant isolates (CDC, Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee. Management of multidrug-resistant organisms in healthcare settings, 2006. Atlanta, GA: US Department of Health and Human Services, CDC, Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee; 2007. Available at http://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/pdf/guidelines/MDROGuideline2006.pdf). Carriage of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in the intestinal tract of returning healthy travelers poses an additional risk for dissemination of these organisms in community settings. - Mod.ML
