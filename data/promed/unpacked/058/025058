[1] Dead seals in 2007: CWSS status report No. 4
Date: Tue 24 Jul 2007

During the weekend [21-22 Jul 2007] the seal situation was monitored
in the Varberg area on the Swedish Kattegat coast [A map is available
at the source URL provided above]. One seal was found with clear
symptoms of phocine distemper virus (PDV).
By the end of last week [16-22 Jul 2007], no new dead animals had
been found in Denmark, indicating a possible fading out of the
epidemic. However, the finding at Varberg implies, according to Tero
Harkonen from the Swedish Natural History Museum, that the epidemic
may now have entered the large seal herds in north Halland, and the
risk of the pest taking a much more serious course than expected
before the weekend has strongly increased. Surveillance in the area
of north Halland will be intensified. Also some dead seals will be
taken for further obductions [? examination].

[2] Dead seals in 2007: CWSS status report No. 3

Dead seals have now been found at the Swedish Kattegat coast. Until
11 Jul 2007, 10 dead seals with PDV symptoms were found in the
southern part of the Swedish Kattegat coast south of Halmstad. The
dead seals were a 5-year-old (140 cm / 55 in), a one-year-old (110 cm
/ 43.3), and the rest, seals born this year [2007]. All had obvious
macroscopic symptoms. A further suspect dead seal was found at
Hallands Vadero. Virological samples have been taken and will be sent
to England for further investigations.
The seal haul-out sites on the uninhabited islands around Laeso were
checked last week, on Thu 5 July 2007, but nothing abnormal was
observed. There is no news regarding the type of PDV virus. The
Danish Veterinary Institute has not yet been able to determine the PDV-type.
On 23 Jun 2007, an unusually high number of dead seal pups were
reported on the island on Anholt, which has caused concern of a new
outbreak of a seal epidemic. Staff of the Danish Forest and Nature
Agency found 33 dead harbour seals on the small island of Hessel,
Kattegat, on Wed 4 Jul 2007.
In 2006, the seal population in the Danish Kattegat was estimated to
be about 5200 seals. In 2000, the population was estimated to about
6300. In 2003 and 2004, the numbers were 5300 and 3745 respectively.
The calculations have been based on 1-2 aerial counts per year and
thus provide only a rough estimate.

[According to status report No. 2 of 12 Jul 2007, the Danish
Veterinary Institute has not yet been able to determine the PDV-type
involved; virological samples "have been taken and will be sent to
England for further investigations". It will be helpful if (even
preliminary) results of said laboratory investigations become available.
The Wadden Sea is a shallow sea extending along the North Sea coasts
of The Netherlands, Germany, and Denmark. It is a highly dynamic
ecosystem. The Common Wadden Sea Secretariat (CWSS), established in
1987 in Wilhelmshaven, Germany, administers the trilateral
cooperation between the 3 countries, addressing the protection and
conservation of the Wadden Sea ecosystem covering management,
monitoring, and research, as well as political matters. Special
attention is paid to wildlife, mainly seals and birds. The so-called
Cooperation Area is 13 500 sq km (5212 sq mi) large.
Since 25 Jun 2007, 4 status reports on mortality in seals have been
published by CWSS; all are available at the URL above, each
accompanied by a map. - Mod.AS]
