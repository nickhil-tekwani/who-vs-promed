Influenza update - 300 (based on data up to 1 Oct 2017)
-------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
Influenza activity remained at low levels in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere. Declining levels of influenza activity were reported in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere and in some countries of South and South East Asia. In Central America and the Caribbean, low influenza activity was reported in a few countries. Worldwide, influenza A(H3N2) and B viruses accounted for the majority of influenza detections.

- In temperate South America, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) activity continued a downward trend throughout most of the sub-region.
- In Southern Africa, influenza activity continued to decrease in South Africa, with influenza B viruses most frequently detected.
- In Oceania, seasonal influenza activity started to decline, with influenza A(H3N2) predominant, followed by B viruses.
- In tropical South America, influenza and RSV activity remained at low levels overall.
- In the Caribbean and Central American countries, respiratory illness indicators and influenza activity remained low in general but RSV activity remained high in several countries.
- In Southern Asia, decreasing levels of influenza activity were reported in India and Bhutan, with A(H1N1)pdm09 most frequently detected.
- In South East Asia, influenza activity appeared to decrease in general, with some exceptions. Influenza activity increased in Cambodia and remained high in Lao PDR, with influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominantly detected.
- In Western Asia, influenza activity continued to increase in Oman, with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses co-circulating. Increased influenza A detections were reported in Bahrain in recent weeks.
- In East Asia, influenza activity remained low in general.
- In Western Africa, influenza detections continued to be reported, with all seasonal influenza subtypes present in the region. In Middle Africa, elevated ILI activity was reported in Cameroon. In Eastern Africa, influenza detections and ILI activity increased sharply in Réunion Island (French Overseas Department), with influenza B viruses predominant.
- In Northern Africa, little to no influenza virus detections was reported.
- In Central Asia, there were no updated reports on virus detections or respiratory illness indicators.
- In Europe, little to no influenza activity was reported.
- In North America, overall influenza virus activity remained low with detections of predominantly influenza A(H3N2) and B viruses in the past few weeks.

National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 85 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from 18 September 2017 to 01 October 2017 (data as of 13 Oct 2017 03:40:32 UTC).The WHO GISRS [Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System] laboratories tested more than 56 528 specimens during that time period. 3496 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 2566 (73.4 percent) were typed as influenza A and 930 (26.6 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 260 (15.1 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 1460 (84.9 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 192 (81 percent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 45 (19 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

[According to this report, influenza A viruses still predominate with more A(H3N2) circulation compared to A(H1N1)pdm09. Some countries in the northern hemisphere reported increased influenza detected but largely the reported activity remained low. No novel influenza viruses were reported during this period. - Mod.UBA]

Abstract
--------
Reduced intensity of the fluorescence signal in the amplification curve was observed when using a WHO recommended real time RT-PCR for influenza virus detection. A single mutation, G189T, in the conserved region of influenza virus matrix gene was detected by Sanger sequencing. The mutation is located in the probe binding region, hence we speculated it could be the reason for the atypical shape of amplification curve. The mutation was first noted in Slovenia in 2011 and 2013 for seasonal influenza A virus types A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2), respectively. In the following years, 2014 and 2015, the majority of influenza A(H3N2) viruses alone carried the mutation. The amplification of matrix gene for these influenza A(H3N2) viruses continuously resulted in the atypically shaped amplification curves. The performance of the particular assay was critically affected; therefore, the assay was no longer usable as diagnostic tool for influenza virus detection. Mutations in the conserved region of influenza virus genome are more common than expected and this would need to be considered when targeting matrix gene.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Infection with the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus results in a high incidence of mortality in humans. Severe complications from infection are often associated with hypercytokinemia. However, current neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) have several limitations including the appearance of oseltamivir-resistant H5N1 virus and the inability to completely ameliorate hyper-immune responses. To overcome these limitations, we evaluated the anti-viral activity of mycophenolic mofetil (MMF) against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1) virus infection using MDCK cells and mice. The IC50 [half maximal inhibitory concentration] of MMF (0.94 μM) was comparable to that of zanamivir (0.87 μM) in H5N1 virus-infected MDCK cells based on ELISA. Time-course assays demonstrated that MMF completely inhibited H5N1 viral mRNA replication and protein expression for approximately 8 h after the initiation of treatment. In addition, MMF treatment protected 100% of mice, and lung viral titers were substantially reduced. The anti-viral mechanism of MMF against H5N1 virus infection was further confirmed to depend on the inhibition of cellular inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) by exogenous guanosine, which inhibits viral mRNA and protein expression. Moreover, IL-1β, IFN-β, IL-6, and IP-10 mRNA expression levels were significantly downregulated in MDCK cells with MMF treatment. These results indicated that MMF could represent a novel inhibitor of viral replication and a potent immunomodulator for the treatment of H5N1 virus infection.

Abstract
--------
Nitazoxanide is a thiazolide compound that was originally developed as an anti-parasitic agent, but has recently been repurposed for the treatment of influenza virus infections. Thought to exert its anti-influenza activity via the inhibition of hemagglutinin maturation and intracellular trafficking in infected cells, the effectiveness of nitazoxanide in treating patients with non-complicated influenza is currently being assessed in phase III clinical trials. Here, we describe the susceptibility of 210 seasonal influenza viruses to tizoxanide, the active circulating metabolite of nitazoxanide. An optimised cell culture-based focus reduction assay was used to determine the susceptibility of A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and influenza B viruses circulating in the southern hemisphere from the period March 2014 to August 2016. Tizoxanide showed potent in vitro antiviral activity against all influenza viruses tested, including neuraminidase inhibitor-resistant viruses, allowing the establishment of a baseline level of susceptibility for each subtype. Median EC50 [half maximal effective concentration] values (+/- IQR) of 0.48 μM (0.33-0.71), 0.62 μM (0.56-0.75), 0.66 μM (0.62-0.69), and 0.60 μM (0.51-0.67) were obtained for A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), B(Victoria lineage), and B(Yamagata lineage) influenza viruses respectively. There was no significant difference in the median baseline tizoxanide susceptibility for each influenza subtype tested. This is the first report on the susceptibility of circulating viruses to tizoxanide. The focus reduction assay format described is sensitive, robust, and less laborious than traditional cell based antiviral assays, making it highly suitable for the surveillance of tizoxanide susceptibility in circulating seasonal influenza viruses.

Abstract
--------
Most pre-clinical animal studies test influenza vaccines in immunologically naïve animal models, even though the results of vaccination may not accurately reflect the effectiveness of vaccine candidates in humans that have pre-existing immunity to influenza. In this study, novel, broadly-reactive influenza vaccine candidates were assessed in pre-immune ferrets. These animals were infected with different H1N1 isolates before being vaccinated or infected with another influenza virus. Previously, our group has described the design and characterization of computationally optimized broadly reactive HA antigens (COBRA) for H1N1 isolates. Vaccinating ferrets with virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines expressing COBRA HA proteins elicited antibodies with HAI activity against more H1N1 viruses in the panel than VLP vaccines expressing wild-type HA proteins. Specifically, ferrets infected with the 1986 virus and vaccinated with a single dose of the COBRA HA VLP vaccines elicited antibodies with HAI activity against 11-14 of the 15 H1N1 viruses isolated between 1934 and 2013. A subset of ferrets was infected with influenza viruses expressing the COBRA HA antigens. These COBRA pre-immune ferrets had superior breadth of hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) activity following vaccination with COBRA HA VLP vaccines than COBRA pre-immune ferrets vaccinated with VLP vaccines expressing wild-type HA proteins. Overall, priming naïve ferrets with COBRA HA based viruses or using COBRA HA based vaccines to boost pre-existing antibodies induced by wild-type H1N1 viruses, COBRA HA antigens elicited sera with the broadest HAI reactivity against multiple antigenic H1N1 viral variants. This is the 1st report demonstrating the effectiveness of a broadly-reactive or universal influenza vaccine in a pre-immune ferret model.
Importance. Currently, many groups are testing influenza vaccine candidates to meet the challenge of developing a vaccine that elicits broadly reactive and long-lasting protective immune responses. The goal of these vaccines is to stimulate immune responses that react against most, if not all, circulating influenza strains, over a long period of time in all populations of people. Commonly, these experimental vaccines are tested in naïve animal models that do not have anti-influenza immune responses, however, humans have pre-existing immunity to influenza viral antigens, particularly antibodies to the HA and NA glycoproteins. Therefore, this study investigated how pre-existing antibodies to historical influenza viruses influenced HAI-specific antibodies and protective efficacy using a broadly protective vaccine candidate.

Abstract
--------
Each influenza season, a set of wild-type viruses, representing one H1N1, one H3N2, 1-2 influenza B isolates, are selected for inclusion in the annual seasonal influenza vaccine. In order to develop broadly reactive subtype specific influenza vaccines, a methodology called computationally optimized broadly reactive antigens (COBRA) was used to design novel hemagglutinin (HA) vaccine immunogens. COBRA technology was effectively used to design HA immunogens that elicited antibodies that neutralized H5N1 and H1N1 isolates. In this report, the development and characterization of 17 prototype H3N2 COBRA HA proteins were screened in mice and ferrets for the elicitation of antibodies with HAI activity against human seasonal H3N2 viruses that were isolated over the last 48 years. The most effective COBRA HA vaccine regimens elicited antibodies with broader HAI activity against a panel of H3N2 viruses compared to wild-type H3 HA vaccines. The top leading COBRA HA candidates were tested against co-circulating variants. These variants were not efficiently detected by antibodies elicited by the wild-type HA from viruses selected as the vaccine candidates. The T-11 COBRA HA vaccine elicited antibodies with HAI and neutralization activity against all co-circulating variants from 2004-2007. This is the 1st report demonstrating broader breadth of vaccine induced antibodies against co-circulating H3N2 strains compared to the wild-type HA antigens that were represented in commercial influenza vaccines.
Importance. There is a need for an improved influenza vaccine that elicits immune responses that recognize a broader number of influenza virus strains to prevent infection and transmission. Using the COBRA approach, a set of vaccines against influenza viruses in the H3N2 subtype were tested for the ability to elicit antibodies that neutralize virus infection against not only historical vaccine strains of H3N2, but also a set of co-circulating variants that circulated between 2004-2007. 3 of the H3N2 COBRA vaccines recognized all the co-circulating strains during this era, but the chosen wild-type vaccine strains were not able to elicit antibodies with HAI activity against these co-circulating strains. Therefore, the COBRA vaccines have the ability to not only elicit protective antibodies against the dominant vaccine strains, but also minor circulating strains that can evolve into the dominant vaccine strains in the future.
