DYSENTERY OUTBREAK UNDER INVESTIGATION
Three homeless men at the Milwaukee Rescue Mission have confirmed cases of
a bacterial dysentery, and Milwaukee Health Department officials were cited
as saying Thursday they are investigating 22 other potential cases in the
outbreak.
Seth Foldy, the department's medical director, added the department has
alerted other shelters and health clinics that minister to the homeless to
be on the lookout for people with diarrheal disease and to report such
cases immediately.
The bacteria in the three confirmed cases are _Shigella sonnei_. The strain
is one of four types of dysentery and produces the mildest form of the
disorder, known more properly as shigellosis.
The story says the disease is passed between humans through contaminated
feces, due to poor hygiene such as lack of adequate hand washing. It can be
passed from person to person by sharing common utensils or cigarettes, for
example, or by an infected person contaminating food or beverages that then
are consumed by others. A person can remain infected for up to two weeks.
The story adds that the bacteria do not originate in food or other animals.
Health department officials said they had a list of 22 people who
frequented the rescue mission and had reported recent illnesses, although
not all had classic symptoms of the disorder.
