Filcho Filev, Mayor of the town of Provadiya, announced on Sunday [9 Aug 2015] that another animal had died of anthrax in the village of Bozveliysko, municipality of Provadiya, district of Varna.

The dead animal was a ram from the same flock as that of the sheep that died on 24 Jul 2015 and was sent to the incinerator in Varna.

Samples of the animal were sent to a lab, as well as samples given by the 35-year-old shepherd, though he said he had not consumed infected meat. All 545 animals in the village were vaccinated. A ban was imposed on the trade of animals.

The village of Bozveliysko has the 2nd anthrax outbreak after the one in Mlada Gvardiya.

Zhivko Panev, Mayor of Bozveliysko, again speaking for Radio FOCUS, announced on Saturday [8 Aug 2015] that all people who had been in contact with anthrax-infected animals were under medical supervision. He reported that lab results would confirm the disease in the 2nd animal by Tuesday [11 Aug 2015]. Panev said that the animal had been immediately buried. The mayor said that all animals in the village had been vaccinated but that the next 7-8 days were critical.

Biser Chilingirov, chairperson of the National Sheep-breeding Association, commented on the recent outbreaks of anthrax and brucellosis, speaking for FOCUS News Agency on Saturday [8 Aug 2015]: "A month and a half ago, there was a meeting between farmers and representatives of the Bulgarian Food Safety Agency to tell farmers what to do in terms of the anthrax disease," he said. Chilingirov added that the major diseases came from Greece, Turkey and Macedonia. "In case of suspicious and atypical behavior of animals (goats, sheep, cows or others), farmers should contact a vet." Mr Chilingirov added that in case there was no private vet in the region, farmers might contact a state vet or the mayor of the settlement.

"Indeed, anthrax is very dangerous, and its spores can live underground for 50 to 70 years as a potential source of disease. We cannot avoid these diseases, but we can provide prevention. There is a need to be literate and have high awareness and to know what to do in such situations," Mr Chilingirov commented. "The sheep-breeders' trade association calls on people not to consume raw meat and raw milk," the expert said.

Chilingirov urged stock-breeders and farmers to wear wire mesh gloves when butchering animals to prevent themselves from getting cuts. He added that the risk of an anthrax infection was highest during animal butchering. Biser Chilingirov told people to purchase products directly from farms, as they were "ecologically clean."

[It would be helpful to know whether all animals on the additional infected holdings have been vaccinated against anthrax; in case confirmed, time of vaccination will be helpful.

The advice given to Bulgarian consumers to avoid raw milk is generally sound, especially in view of the recent brucellosis situation (yet to be reported to the OIE). Regarding raw meat, explanation will be helpful; anthrax deserves to be addressed by proper surveillance and meticulous vaccination of ruminants in endemic regions.

According to Mod.MHJ's commentary in posting 20150720.3523608, the affected northeast region of Bulgaria is regularly afflicted with livestock anthrax outbreaks year after year. For more information on the Bulgarian anthrax situation, subscribers are referred to the said commentary. - Mod.AS
