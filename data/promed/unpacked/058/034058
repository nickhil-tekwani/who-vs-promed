Subject: Anthrax Interagency Update 3 Aug 2001
Total number of carcasses found so far: 82 bison (44 bulls, 37 cows and one
unknown) and one cow moose.
Initial area closed: 341 square kilometers. Area closed was expanded to
2700 square kilometers on 25 Jul 2001 due to the discovery of three
outlying carcasses.
Fixed wing aircraft surveys over other primary bison ranges have not
discovered any further outbreaks areas. The last 2 rotary wing surveys
could not find any fresh carcasses. The outbreak area has experienced
cooler temperatures and rain over the last week. The next rotary wing
surveys are scheduled for this Saturday and Sunday (4 Aug and 5 Aug 2001).
We are cautiously optimistic however we also recognize that last year's
outbreak in the delta started on 1 Aug 2000 and ended 18 Aug 2000.
The new closure is larger than the actual outbreak area. Our Geographic
Information System technician, Christina Kaeser, developed the area
boundaries based on an assessment of recent herd observations over the last
2 years, carcass locations from previous anthrax outbreaks, and potential
bison habitat (based on a classified Landsat satellite image). This area
closure process has been one of the lessons learned from this year's
outbreak. With this type of analysis backing our closure decisions we can
be sure we are fully mitigating the potential risk of human-carcass
contact. Secondly, by closing all potential bison habitat in the area we
decrease the need for incremental closure area increases every time a
carcass is discovered outside the current boundaries. We found last year
that each area increase became a media event...forcing us to spend valuable
time doing interviews about lines on maps.
We are still looking at formaldehyde treatment options and ground torch
burning. We have been able to borrow a ground torch unit and expect it here
late next week. I am working on health and safety issues around using
formaldehyde and jellied gasoline products. So far I have found that there
aren't many pieces of protective equipment that work for both anthrax and
jellied gasoline....! We discovered this week that formaldehyde is listed
on the Pest Control Products Act. As a result, a full Canadian
Environmental Assessment Act environmental screening is required (with
input from Environment Canada and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans).

[It should be pointed out that this site is hundreds of miles from anywhere
and that formaldehyde degrades to a useful nitrogen source in a matter of a
few weeks. The point of using 5% formaldehyde in the field, by spraying it
over the carcasses when found, is that it stops scavengers immediately and
thus very significantly reduces the spore contamination of the area, quite
apart from any disinfection benefits accruing from its use. Yet again we
thank Jonah for keeping us informed. - Mod.MHJ
