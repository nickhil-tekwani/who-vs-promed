The state's 1st West Nile-positive mosquitoes of the year [2007] have
been confirmed in a batch from Clarkdale in Yavapai County, health
officials said.
"We've had some pretty heavy rains. That's creating backyard
breeding," said Craig Levy, head of the state Department of Health
Service's vector-borne and zoonotic diseases section. "That's
probably why we're noticing mosquitoes a little earlier than usual."
Maricopa County workers are checking traps at about 500 locations and
haven't found a West Nile-positive mosquito yet, said John Townsend,
manager of the county's vector control program.
But traps in Gilbert, Tempe, east Mesa and elsewhere are collecting
hundreds of _Culex_ mosquitoes, the variety that most commonly
carries the deadly West Nile virus.
Last year [2006], it was late June before the 1st West Nile-carrying
mosquitoes were confirmed, and they were in La Paz County.
By October [2007], the virus had infected 150 Arizonans and killed 11
of them, including 6 in Maricopa County, health officials said.
In 2005, there were 106 human cases and 4 deaths, with 16 deaths and
391 cases in 2004, according to state statistics.

[West Nile virus activity is beginning to show up in the southern
tier of states in the U.S. It will be interesting to see whether
there are more human and animal (equine, wild bird) cases than last
year (2006), given this early start to the season.
