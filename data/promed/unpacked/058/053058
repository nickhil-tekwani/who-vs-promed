Yellow smut attacks wheat crop in Kandi area
--------------------------------------------
An attack of yellow smut disease [stripe rust] on wheat crop has
recently been noticed in the Kandi area of [Hoshiarpur] district. The
chief agriculture officer, Dr Sarbjit Singh Kandhari, said that more
than 500 hectares [1235 acres] had been affected where 5 to 10 per
cent damage had been caused due to infection.

Agriculture officials had visited the affected areas and instructed
farmers to control its further attack. Fungicide was being given to
the farmers on 50 per cent subsidy.

Dr Kandhari appealed to the farmers to regularly check their standing
crops, and in case of any sign of yellow smut they should immediately
inform the agriculture officer of their respective area so that
necessary steps could be taken to control the disease.

[Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereals is caused by the
fungus _Puccinia striiformis_ var. _striiformis_. It causes yellow
leaf stripes and stunting of plants with yield losses of 40 to 100 per
cent. The disease affects wheat, some barley varieties, triticale, and
a number of wild grasses. Spores are wind dispersed in several cycles
during the cropping season, and the fungus survives on living host
plants generating a "green bridge" between seasons. Disease management
includes the use of resistant varieties, fungicide applications, and
control of volunteer crops.

New stripe rust strains with increased virulence are emerging
worldwide. Regional monitoring programmes to recognise them, as well
as resistance breeding programmes have been established, but the
process of releasing new varieties to farmers is slow.

In India, the emergence of a new strain was confirmed in Punjab and
Himachal Pradesh in 2009, and a change of wheat cultivars was
recommended to farmers (ProMED-mail post 20090329.1216). It is not
clear from the report above whether a change of varieties is taking
place in the region.
