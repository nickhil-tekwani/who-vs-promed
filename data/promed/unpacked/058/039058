Cholera in Burundi
------------
As of 15 Jul 2002, the Ministry of Health has reported a total of 217
cases, including 2 deaths, since the outbreak began on 17 Jun 2002, with
the majority of cases in Bujumbura Rurale, particularly affecting Rushubi,
Nyambuye, Gihosha, Gikungu. The main cause of the outbreak has been an
inadequate supply of safe drinking water and use of polluted local water
sources.
The Ministry of Health has established a technical committee to contain the
outbreak. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian
Affairs (OCHA), is working with the Ministry of Health and nongovernmental
organizations to coordinate the response. A treatment center has been
established by Medecins sans Frontieres in Gihosa, water purification
tablets have been distributed and a plan for the long-term decontamination
of the Nyakabugu River has been developed.

6 die of cholera as Niger faces outbreak in South
-------------------------
NIAMEY - 6 people have died of cholera in the past week in southern Niger,
where 70 cases have been recorded, the health ministry said in a statement
received here Wednesday, 17 Jul 2002. Most of the cases are confined to
the Gaya region of the semi-desert west African country.
The statement called for calm and urged strict adherence to hygiene rules
that help prevent the spread of the infectious and potentially fatal
disease, such as washing hands before eating and disinfecting fruit and
vegetables with chlorinated water. The health ministry also warned against
eating raw food or drinking dirty water.
The statement said the ministry would step up safeguards against cholera
across the impoverished country, adding that medication was available at
health clinics to forestall an epidemic.
Cholera invaded west Africa in 1970, more than a century after the last
case was seen in the region, according to the UN World Health Organization
(WHO). The disease quickly spread, and eventually became endemic to most of
the African continent.

Cholera (Tatarstan, Russia Federation)
---------------
A peak of the cholera outbreak is over in the capital of Tatarstan. The
doctors and city's municipal services have gained full control of the
situation, stated Gennady Onishchenko, Deputy Health Minister of the
Russian Federation.
According to the Echo of Moscow radio station, the cholera bacterium was
found in 47 people out of 247 who were admitted to the hospital for
suspicion of cholera infection, 5 people more than yesterday. No new
cholera cases have been reported over the past 3 days.
92 000 citizens have been examined by doctors in the new quarter of the
city, where the disease broke out, and no cholera cases have been found.
According to the cholera taskforce headquarters, 8000 living in the 7
suburban villages will also be examined. The villages are situated on the
banks of the river into which the infected waters might have been
discharged, due to an accident at a water collector.
In addition to the working 300 doctors, another 180 specialists and 10 cars
have been deployed to tackle the disease. All those examined by doctors in
Kazan are being given corresponding certificates, to prevent them from
undergoing additional medical testing in other regions of Russia.
