Ebola Situation Report -- 15 Jul 2015 [as of 12 Jul 2015]
---------------------------------------
SUMMARY
There were 30 confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) reported in the week to 12 Jul 2015: 13 in Guinea, 3 in Liberia, and 14 in Sierra Leone. Although the total number of confirmed cases is the same as the previous week, there has been a shift in the foci of transmission. For the 1st time in several months, most cases were reported from Conakry and Freetown, the capitals of Guinea and Sierra Leone, respectively. All 9 of the cases reported from Conakry and all 10 of the cases reported from Freetown were either registered contacts of a previous case or have an established epidemiological link to a known chain of transmission. One of the 30 cases reported in the week to 12 Jul 2015 arose from a yet unknown source of infection. However, a substantial proportion of cases (7 of 30: 23 percent) continue to be identified as EVD-positive only after post-mortem testing. This suggests that although improvements to case investigation are increasing, our understanding of chains of transmission, contact tracing -- which aims to minimise transmission by identifying symptoms among contacts at the earliest stage of infection -- is still a challenge in several areas.

Guinea
-------
In Guinea, cases were reported from the prefectures of Conakry, Forecariah, and Fria. The northern prefecture of Boke, which has been a focus of transmission for over a month, has not reported a case for 11 days; 9 cases were reported from Conakry, 7 of which are linked to a chain of transmission in the Ratoma area; 3 cases, one of whom is a health worker, were reported from Forecariah. The source of exposure of the health worker is under investigation. The remaining case in Guinea was reported from the prefecture of Fria, which had not reported a case for over 40 days. The case is a contact from Boke who had been lost to follow-up.

Liberia
-------
Three new cases were reported from Liberia in the week to 12 Jul 2015, taking the total number of cases since 29 Jun to 6. The country had not previously reported a case since 20 Mar 2015. All 3 confirmed cases reported in the week to 12 Jul 2015 were registered contacts associated with the same chain of transmission as the 3 cases reported the previous week. One of the cases reported in the week to 12 Jul 2015 had symptom onset in a quarantined home in Montserrado County, near to the capital, Monrovia, before being transferred to an Ebola Treatment Centre. The origin of the cluster of cases remains under investigation. Preliminary evidence from genomic sequencing strongly suggests that the most likely origin of transmission is a re-emergence of the virus from a survivor within Liberia.

Sierra Leone
------------
In Sierra Leone, 14 cases were reported from Freetown, Kambia, and Port Loko. Of the 10 cases reported from Freetown, 8 came from quarantined homes in the Magazine Wharf area of the city, which has been a focus of transmission for several weeks. The remaining 2 cases from Freetown were reported from other areas of the city but are associated with the Magazine Wharf chain of transmission. Two chiefdoms in Kambia reported cases this week, compared with 4 the previous week; 2 cases were reported from the northwestern chiefdom of Samu, one of which was a community death. The remaining case from Kambia was reported from Tonko Limba chiefdom. In Port Loko, a single case was reported from the chiefdom of Marampa.

On 12 Jul 2015, there were 3552 contacts being monitored across 6 prefectures in Guinea, 2 counties in Liberia, and 3 districts in Sierra Leone.

One new health worker infection was reported from Forecariah, Guinea in the week to 12 Jul 2015. There have been a total of 876 confirmed health worker infections reported from Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone since the start of the outbreak, with 509 reported deaths... - more

UNHRD Operations Update. Response to the Ebola Outbreak
-----------------------------------------------------------------
UNHRD is a network of depots around the world (in Ghana, Italy, UAE, Malaysia, Panama, Spain) that procures, stores, manages, and transports emergency items on behalf of the humanitarian community.

UNHRD facilities in Accra and Las Palmas have served as regional staging areas, and the Accra depot hosted UNMEER headquarters. UNHRD Accra continues to support the transportation of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) in the region. PPE kits were prepared by the team in Accra and are being shipped across West African countries as part of a WHO preparedness initiative, providing protection to 12 500 health workers.

On behalf of the World Food Program (WFP), UNHRD procured and dispatched construction material and equipment for remote logistics hubs, Ebola Treatment Units and Community Care Centres. Most recently, in collaboration with WHO, UNHRD began procuring and dispatching equipment to establish camps for teams tracing EVD. Members of the Rapid Response Team (RRT) are building the camps.

https://ebolaresponse.un.org/sites/default/files/150710_-_unmeer_external_situation_report.pdf


UN Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER) External Situation Report
---------------------------------------
Key Points:
In Liberia, ETUs ready for EVD patients;
In Sierra Leone, Kambia District hosts cross-border meeting;
In Guinea, FAO project aims to detect EVD in animals.

Key Political and Economic Developments
--------------------------
1. NTSR (nothing significant to report)

Response Efforts and Health
---------------------
2. In total, 27 585 confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of Ebola have been reported in the 3 most affected countries. There have been 11 253 reported deaths.

3. Liberia's Ministry of Health has so far confirmed 5 EVD cases in the recent outbreak in Nedowein, Margibi County. That includes 2 new cases confirmed on 7 Jul 2015, which are on the contact list and are being actively monitored. As of 9 Jul 2015, there were 132 contacts (115 in Margibi County and 17 in Montserrado County) from the 5 cases; 9 homes are under voluntary precautionary observation, with food, water and other supplies such as hygiene kits having been rapidly deployed to support these families and their communities. Hand washing stations have been installed in 6 communities in the affected communities.

4. In Liberia, the source of transmission of the recent EVD outbreak is still unknown, but investigations continue. Meanwhile, Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs) are ready to receive referred patients. There are approximately 90 beds in the ETUs that are on alert for referrals. The Government continues to advocate testing of all corpses and conducting of safe and dignified burials.

5. In Guinea, FAO is implementing a project that will rapidly detect EVD in animals and prevent animal-to-human transmission. The project involves developing animal surveillance systems and supporting the collection and analysis of epidemiological data in animals. Local partners will be trained in the collection of wildlife epidemiological data using appropriate biosecurity measures. Already, FAO has selected 50 persons as part of a network conducting surveillance of human and animal diseases in the Mamou prefecture.

6. In Sierra Leone, the bi-monthly cross-border taskforce meeting was hosted by the Kambia District Ebola Response Centre on 9 Jul 2015. Surveillance and social mobilisation response workers from Guinea's Forecariah Prefecture and Northern Sierra Leone attended the meeting. Both teams shared experiences and updated everyone on their respective epidemiological situations, quarantine and social mobilisation activities. The Guinean team also briefed attendees on recent efforts to curtail EVD transmission in the sub-prefecture of Benty, including measures to prevent movement of missing contacts across the border to Kambia District.

7. UNMEER Acting-SRSG Mr. Peter Graaff on 9 Jul 2015 met with 15 publishers, editors and proprietors of various media institutions in Sierra Leone. He briefed them on the Ebola situation in the region, UNMEER transition and post-Ebola, and lessons learned. The SRSG reminded them that getting communities' cooperation has proven to be an effective way to achieve zero transmission. He said that even as UNMEER winds down its operations, the UN will continue to support the governments in Ebola-affected countries to strengthen social services, particularly the health system.

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/12/guinea-president-alpha-conde-ebola-aid
[According to Guinea president, Alpha Conde, "Ebola is contrary to all Guinean customs and habits. Ebola goes against all of our systems, all of our rites, our funeral rites, our habits. We are naturally warm people; we embrace. Ebola forced us to change, completely ... it forced us to act completely against our very natures and customs." President Conde was adamant that rebuilding a functional health system remained his main priority. In addition, President Conde said: "People flee hospitals where Ebola is being treated. So with Ebola, people die of other diseases, because they are afraid. Ebola has, as a consequence, increased the number of deaths from other diseases, particularly malaria."]

[According to David Nabarro, Senior United Nations System Coordinator for Ebola virus disease, the Ebola epidemic has not run its course. Approximately 30 people are still getting infected each week. Under normal circumstances, an infection rate of 30 people a week would be considered "a major, major outbreak." In addition, Mr. Nabarro said: "Probably about 1/3rd of these people are not coming from the contact list, which means they are surprise cases, and that's a big worry." Olawale Maiyegun, social affairs director at the African Union Commission, said it seemed communities were forgetting a key "ABC" or "avoid body contact" rule and becoming complacent. Mr. Maiyegun said: "Where is the ABC rule? I saw people dancing together, I was alarmed in (Sierra Leone's capital) Freetown."]

http://asia.nikkei.com/Tech-Science/Science/Fujifilm-developing-treatment-for-post-Ebola-syndrome
[Fujifilm is developing a treatment for "post-Ebola syndrome," a condition in which Ebola virus remains in patients' bodies after they receive treatment and continues to cause medical problems, primarily with the eyes. The Japanese photographic film manufacturer will use the influenza drug Avigan, developed by its group company Toyama Chemical, to treat Ebola survivors in West Africa. Their number exceeds 15 000, and 30-50 per cent of them suffer from continuing physical problems. In late May 2015, Fujifilm submitted a clinical trial plan to treat post-Ebola syndrome to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration through its American affiliate. Fujifilm will conduct the clinical trial in West Africa. The company plans to work with U.S. and European research institutions to decide on evaluation methods and which patients to target. The clinical trial will focus on whether Avigan can shorten the time the Ebola virus stays in patients' bodies. ... Recent studies suggest that such symptoms are caused by Ebola virus that remained in some organs [shielded from] immune systems. There are also cases in which the Ebola virus is found in patients' semen a few months after the virus became undetectable in the blood... - more]
