A veterinarian should be called promptly in cases of skin disease in horses, according to researchers, who have described a case of fungal dermatitis resulting in the gelding becoming very unwell.

The researchers, writing in the journal Animals (https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/10/5/871), have reported on what they describe as a rare case of generalized fungal dermatitis in a horse caused by _Geotrichum candidum_.

There are 13 species of this yeast-like fungi, commonly found in soil, air, water, milk, silage, and plant tissues. It can be isolated from the digestive tract, skin, vagina, and mouth of humans and other mammals. On occasion, it is known to cause localized skin disease in humans and animals.

Barbara Padalino and her colleagues said the 11-year-old bay saddle horse developed a well-defined area of non-itchy nodules, about 1 to 2 cm across, on the neck. The lesions appeared a week after standing surgery to remove a fracture from the splint bone, after which the horse received antibiotics to reduce the risk of infection.

Following surgery, the horse was boxed and wore a winter waterproof wool blanket with a neck cover to stay warm. He was bedded on straw.

On the development of the skin lesions, the owner did not consult with a veterinarian, as they were suspected to represent an allergic reaction. The owner gave corticosteroids orally for a week.

No improvement occurred and the horse lost weight -- an estimated 50 kg (110 lb) over 3 weeks, which was attributed to reduced appetite. A week after stopping the steroids, a veterinarian was consulted.

The veterinarian identified further skin nodules, devoid of hair, on the upper part of the front legs. Parental corticosteroids and antihistamine were prescribed for a week, as an allergic reaction was still clinically suspected.

During this 2nd treatment regimen, and continuing for an additional 2 weeks, dermatitis spread to the head, shoulders and legs. The horse's appetite remained poor and he became lethargic, with clinical signs of colic, which were then treated with flunixin meglumine.

A 2nd veterinarian was then consulted, about a month after the initial nodules developed over the neck. The horse had a fever and increased heart and respiratory rates. Hair was shedding or easily pulled from the head, neck, shoulder, chest and all 4 legs, with severe swelling of the hind limbs and carpal region.

Yellow exudate could be easily squeezed from the surface of a skin erosion on the left knee. Large white loosely adherent scales coated the developing bald areas, with thick keratin-rich crusts. Blood, hair samples and skin biopsies were taken for analysis.

Blood analysis revealed mildly elevated levels of white cells and excess globulins. There was further evidence of inflammation.

Testing of the collected samples ruled out parasites and bacteria. Further analysis identified yeast-like structures and _G. candidum_ was isolated on culture. The horse was successfully treated with an antifungal solution and antioxidants.

Three weeks after topical treatment, the horse had gained weight -- about 80 kg (176 lb), according to a body-weight tape -- and the bald regions showed new hair growth with fewer crusts. Blood and biochemical parameters had returned to the normal range.

The antifungal treatment was continued 2 times a week for 3 more months. The horse recovered completely. Antioxidant supplementation was recommended as an ongoing dietary supplementation as prescribed.

The authors said the infection had caused chronic skin disease and significant illness, partly attributed to incorrect clinical management.

"The goal of this case report is to educate horse owners, trainers and veterinarians to consider utilizing various diagnostic tools to enable accurate diagnosis of disease, especially where the initial clinical response to treatment is poor."

Discussing the case, the authors say the early corticosteroid treatment may have impaired the immune system of this horse, making the horse susceptible to contracting a fungal infection.

"This case report highlights the importance of collecting appropriate samples to enable a thorough clinical workup of skin diseases in horses.

"Due to the initial lack of appropriate treatment when the skin disease first developed, this horse experienced prolonged sufferance for more than 2 months, developing chronic, spreading skin disease, with systemic signs of illness including weight loss, inappetence, fever, and colic.

"But this case demonstrates appropriate laboratory tests should always be conducted as part of the basic principles of responsible pet ownership and proper veterinary duty of care, which are important to safeguard animal health and well-being."

They said the housing conditions of this horse may have been beneficial for fungal infection to become established.

"The waterproof wool blanket may have created a humid microenvironment and increased sweat production as previously reported, favoring the growth and spread of the fungus.

"Moreover, the horse was stabled day and night, with little exposure to direct sunlight, which is vital for vitamin D production, important to keep skin healthy.

"Glucocorticoid and antibiotic usage, and perhaps some debilitation induced from the previous surgery, may have further predisposed the horse to developing fungal infection."

They said the failure to identify the disease early in its course also played a role in the development of extensive skin disease.

While there are 13 species of _Geotrichum_, _G. candidum_ is one of the most important species reported to cause infection in animals. _G. candidum_ had been isolated in 28.1% of the horses in a retrospective study of 64 horses presenting with skin lesions referable to fungal infection, the authors noted.

The case report team said a veterinarian should be promptly called in cases of skin disease in horses, and appropriate samples should be collected for testing.

"In the case of suspected fungi disease, multiple skin biopsy samples and crusts should be collected and submitted to the pathology laboratory.

"Late intervention, incorrect diagnosis, and inappropriate treatment regimens may lead to poor health and sufferance of patients, which should and can be avoided."

The study team comprised Padalino, who is with the Department of Agricultural and Food Sciences at the University of Bologna in Italy; Jeanine Rhoda Sandy, with the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory at the City University of Hong Kong; and Roberta Barrasso, Adriana Trotta, Giancarlo Bozzo and Claudia Cafarchia, all with the Department of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Bari in Italy.

[_Geotrichum candidum_ is an extremely common fungus with a worldwide distribution. It is commonly isolated from soil, air, water, milk, silage, plant tissues, and the digestive tract in humans and other mammals. Pulmonary involvement is the most frequently reported form of the disease in humans and animals, but bronchial, oral, vaginal, cutaneous and alimentary infections have also been noted
(https://mycology.adelaide.edu.au/descriptions/hyphomycetes/geotrichum/).

_G. candidum_ is a mold rather than a yeast, but in its early colonial growth, it appears yeastlike. This fungus is found widely in nature, and its isolation is not necessarily significant. Two cultural forms occur. They are referred to as the glabrous, or yeastlike, and the fluffy form. The glabrous form of _G. candidum_ is the form usually associated with disease.

Infections due to this fungus in animals are rare. They have been reported from pigs, ocelot, horses, cattle, dogs, fowl, and humans. The bronchi, lungs, udder, and the mucous membranes of the alimentary tract are most frequently affected. The disease is usually mild and is characterized by the formation of granulomas that may suppurate.

Purulent material or scrapings from lesions are examined in wet mounts. The organism appears as rectangular (4-8 microns) or large spherical (4-10 microns) arthroconidia. They are thick-walled, nonbudding, and in stained smears are strongly gram-positive (https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/geotrichum-candidum).

While steroids can be useful for a number of different issues, use of them without knowing what is being treated can depress the immune system and allow other disease processes to essentially take over. It seems this is what was happening in this horse. As this particular organism can and does affect humans, one is wise to not mess with unknown skin/disease situations but to seek prompt medical care. Had this individual called the veterinarian and testing was performed earlier, this animal would not have suffered so much and would have bounced back so much quicker. - Mod.TG
