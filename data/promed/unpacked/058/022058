The Centers for Disease Control's "Summary of Health Information for
International Travel", commonly known as the Blue Sheet, recently has
provided an update of vaccination requirements for travel to Saudi Arabia for
the upcoming pilgrimage to Mecca. There are also requirements for yellow
fever and diphtheria vaccination, depending on country of origin and route of
travel.
The statement is reprinted from the WHO Weekly Epidemiologic Record, No. 50,
13 Dec 96. The Blue Sheet is also available on the CDC website for those
with such access. The entire CDC "Health Information for International
Travel" (so-called Yellow Book) is reached at http://www.cdc.gov/ . Choose
the Travelers' Health menu.

The Islamic year being of a different length to the solar year, or the year
of most [other] calendars, (? about 11 days shorter), the period of the Hajj
slowly moves through the different seasons of the solar year. This has
implications for health problems, certainly for heat-exhaustion among
pilgrims (addressed by the Saudi Arabian authorities) and also for infections.
