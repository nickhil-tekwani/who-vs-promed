[This is the 2nd part of the daily update following the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on selected countries of interest. To reduce the size of these posts, there will be changes over the coming days. The tables will be reduced but are available at the source URLs and will be referred to in the summaries of daily changes for each country. Countries that have almost interrupted transmission and have been lifting restrictions (China, South Korea) and have lessons to learn as they attempt to prevent explosive 2nd waves will continue to be profiled. We will attempt to select countries from each region on a daily basis. - Mod.UBA]

[According to the report above, in the past 24 hours, there have been 6 newly confirmed cases in China, 1 indigenous and 5 imported. No new deaths were reported. Also, 3 new cases were reported in Hong Kong, none in Macau and Taiwan. A total of 1776 imported cases have been reported. There have been no new deaths reported for several weeks, further supporting a reduced level of cases in the country.

There were 5 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic individuals in the past 24 hours, 4 of which were imported. There was one case of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The previous report of a conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic was on 4 Jun 2020 when 1 conversion was reported. Prior to that, there were 2 cases on 1 Jun 2020, and a single case was reported on 18 May 2020 (COVID-19 update (194): China, S Korea, countries w/ high local trans, Italy phase 2 20200519.7352327).

Recurrent questions: What is the total number of asymptomatic cases? What is the total number of asymptomatic cases that converted to symptomatic? What is the proportion of asymptomatic imported cases that have been linked to transmission chains resulting in outbreak clusters?

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 57 cases and no new deaths compared with 51 cases and no new deaths in the previous day (5 Jun 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 62 consecutive days. Today's (6 Jun 2020) breakdown of cases: 53 cases were locally transmitted, and 4 were imported cases. Locally acquired cases were in Seoul (27), Gyeonggi (19), Incheon (6), and 1 in Deagu. Imported cases were in Incheon (1), Chungcheongbuk (1), and Quarantine (2). Note that 11 provinces did not report any newly confirmed cases.

The English language page, notice 360 (https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030), update on clusters from 6 Jun 2020:
- Coupang logistics center cluster in Bucheon-si, Gyeonggi Province, 3 additional cases were confirmed. In total, 133* cases have been confirmed: 79 workers of the logistics center; 54 contacts / Gyeonggi=63, Incheon=49, Seoul=21
- Newly [established] churches in the Seoul Metropolitan Region, 2 additional cases were confirmed. In total, 82* cases have been confirmed: Related to churches = 31; Contacts = 51 / Incheon = 44; Seoul = 23; Gyeonggi = 15
- Richway in Gwanak-gu, Seoul, 3 additional cases were confirmed. In total, 45 cases have been confirmed. All persons who have visited Richway (Seoul Gwangak-gu Siheungdae-ro 552 Seocheon Building Floor 8) between ca. 21 May - 3 Jun 2020 are advised to get tested regardless of symptoms; Seoul = 27; Gyeonggi = 7; Incheon = 8; Chungnam = 2; Gangwon = 1
- In Yongin-si, Gyeonggi Province, investigation of the transmission route of the confirmed case of 2 Jun 2020 revealed that the case had met with a pastor from a church Yongin-si (Grace Forest Church) on 27 May 2020. From testing of all contacts, 7 additional cases were confirmed. Further epidemiological investigation on chains of transmission is underway: Family = 1; Acquaintance = 6 / Seoul = 4; Gyeonggi = 2; Incheon = 1

Impression: Lifting of measures has been accompanied by increases in locally acquired infections through increasing clusters related to gatherings of people at employment (bringing it outside employment to contacts), and in houses of worship, and bars and clubs. It just takes one super spreader in a crowded place to transmit and lead to a sizeable cluster.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 234 801 cases, including 33 846 deaths, up by 270 cases and 72 deaths in the past 24 hours. The previous day's (4 Jun 2020) 24-hour change was 518 cases and 95 deaths. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are still in decline. The major increase in cases was in Lombardy, reporting 142 newly confirmed cases.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in the northern part of the country (see table at http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_notizie_4862_0_file.pdf), in Lombardy, the original epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna, Piedmont, and Liguria. These 4 provinces combined today (6 Jun 2020) account for 93.1% of reported newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Lombardy again reported the largest number of newly confirmed cases in the 24-hour period (142) and was the only province reporting more than 50 new cases. Also, 16 provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (5 provinces reported no new cases), with another 4 provinces reporting fewer than 50 newly confirmed cases, all signs of decreasing local transmission.

The top 5 provinces by cumulative case count are Lombardy, followed by Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Tuscany. The top 5 provinces by number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours are Lombardy (142), followed by Piedmont (38), Lazio (28), Emilia-Romagna (17) and Liguria (13).

Italy is now 33 days post phase 2 initial opening up and 17 days post 2nd stage of phase 2 opening up. All eyes are now on Italy as lockdown restrictions are phased out. The increase in positive cases in Lombardy related to screening activities bears watching.

[4] Iran: 169 425 total cases, 8209 deaths
Date: Sat 6 Jun 2020

The number of daily new coronavirus cases in Iran has fallen back to under 3000, the health ministry said Friday [5 Jun 2020], a day after hitting a new peak.

Authorities registered 2886 new cases of infection, health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said, bringing the total number to 167 156 since the start of the outbreak in February 2020.

The Islamic republic on Thursday [4 Jun 2020] announced a record 3574 daily infections, passing a high point set in March 2020, after breaching the 3000-mark for several days.

Jahanpour said Friday [5 Jun 2020] that 63 more people had died, with the official death toll now at 8134, the highest in the Middle East.

There has been some skepticism at home and abroad about Iran's official figures, with concerns that the real toll could be much higher.

Authorities have been progressively lifting restrictions imposed to curb the outbreak, and life has almost returned to normal in most of the country's 31 provinces. But the southwestern province of Khuzestan remains classified as a "red zone," the highest level of risk in the country, and with greater restrictions.

Seven other provinces, mainly in the south and west, are still under a "health alert," Jahanpour said, down from 9 announced earlier this week. He urged people in these areas to "follow social distancing instructions, wear a mask, and avoid unnecessary travel."

The rising trajectory of infection figures since a low in early May 2020 has authorities worried, and the health ministry has stepped up a public health campaign.

Officials have also suggested that the surge could be a result of wider testing, with Jahanpour saying Thursday [4 Jun 2020] that Iran had conducted over a million tests.

[As of 5 Jun 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran is 169 425, including 8209 deaths, an increase of 2269 new cases and 75 deaths since 4 Jun 2020, and a decrease in daily newly confirmed cases from 2886 newly confirmed cases and slight increase in deaths from the 63 reported in the preceding 24-hour period. Iran has started relaxing restrictions on a more widespread basis in the country. With the increasing daily case reports almost approaching the prior peak in late March-early April 2020, it is clear that there is now a 2nd wave, most likely due to too early lifting of restrictions.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA as per Worldometer data. I have tried to find out where the 12 800 newly confirmed cases in New York State came from, unless they are from the addition of enhanced screening and contact tracing that has begun. These data do not sync with the official published data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 1 989 544, including 111 627 deaths, an increase from 1 965 708 cases and 111 390 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York City had a cumulative total of 203 430 as of 13:00 EDT on 6 Jun 2020 (an increase of 601 newly confirmed cases since 5 Jun 2020) including 17 113 confirmed deaths (an increase of 58 deaths since 4 Jun 2020) and an additional 4702 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

The top 10 states in terms of daily reported cases in descending order are California, Texas, North Carolina, Florida, Arizona, New York, Illinois, Virginia, Georgia, and Maryland.

In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by New Jersey, California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Texas, Michigan, Florida, and Maryland. A total of 35 states and entities have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) has a growth curve and a table giving demographics (age and ethnicity) when known.
