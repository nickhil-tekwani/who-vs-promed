BACTERIAL WILT, BANANA - UGANDA: CONTROL MEASURES

For half a century Margaret Nabukeera of Busaana sub-county in Kayunga
district has grown bananas (matooke). The crop has been the main food and
cash crop for her like for many peasants in the area. But recent
developments have threatened her source of livelihood and she does not see
a solution in the near future.
[Ms Nabukeera], now in her 70s, neither knows the disease that is
destroying her garden nor any possible cure. "What I see is my bananas
drying up and ripening before they mature, I have never heard or used any
method to control the disease because I don't know it," she says. She is
talking about banana wilt, better known as banana bacterial wilt disease
(BBWD) in agricultural circles. BBWD started in Mukono district and spread
through central Uganda to the western region, particularly in the banana
growing districts of Bushenyi, Isingiro, and Ntungamo.
According to Peter Ssetenda, programme assistant at the Centre for
Integrated Development (CIDev) in Kayunga, BBWD is known to have begun in
Bulyanti village, Kyabaala parish, in Mukono district in September 2001. It
has spread to 19 districts and continues to spread. The most affected areas
in Kayunga district, which were formerly under Mukono, are Busaana, Nazigo,
and Kangulumira sub-counties.
It is difficult to trace how the disease spreads but Mbarara district
agriculture officer, Charles Byaruhanga, suspects traders had a hand in it.
Daily Monitor went to Kayunga and Mbarara to find out why the disease has
persisted and the efforts being made to control it. Byaruhanga told Daily
Monitor in Mbarara that the lorries, which used to bring vanilla from
Mukono to Bushenyi, could have brought the disease.
No new outbreaks
----------------
"We think the disease could have been transmitted through the tyres of the
lorries which would leave infected mud in other areas. Also, some farmers
used to load vanilla and infected bananas together with soil, which would
be planted in Bushenyi."
Mr Byaruhanga confirms that BBWD arrived in Mbarara 2 years ago and up to
now the disease has no local name although they have taken measures to
control it. "We have not been having new outbreaks in the region ever since
we started preventive methods," he says. The measure begins with
identifying the disease.
According to Byaruhanga, BBWD is a soilborne disease and gains entry in
plant bodies through roots and openings on plants caused by nematodes. It
is most serious in poorly drained soils and it can be spread through
infected suckers. Initially, it appears in older leaves and then premature
fruit starts ripening. Soon after, the male bud (empumumpu) starts
withering and rotting. In the end, the bud dries up and drops off.
This is confirmed by Moses Kibumba, the BBWD district coordinator in
Kayunga. "The leaves tend to turn yellow as if they have been burnt by fire
and the banana fingers develop a rare yellowish colour, before rotting
within a short time," he says. He adds that, "When peeling banana fingers
from the infected plant you realise that they are brownish inside or at
times coloured black. The brown and black colours are a true indication of
the disease." "And also when you cut the banana stem or peel the fingers,
after about 5 to 15 minutes, the sap turns creamish in colour," he adds.
In the western region, the disease mainly affected areas of Mwizi
sub-county, Nyamitanga, and Ruharo divisions in Mbarara municipality. In
Kayunga and Mbarara, NGOs (non-governmental organisations) like CIDev,
Caritas, a Catholic Church NGO, government agencies like the National
Agriculture Advisory Services (Naads) and National Agriculture Research
Organisation (Naro), have set up task forces to champion control measures
among farmers.
Members of the taskforces include district secretaries for production,
farmers, and extension workers at the sub county and local council levels.
"Many farmers have been following the different ways of controlling the
disease while others are either reluctant or too old to follow the steps,"
Byaruhanga said. The taskforces also guide farmers on how to prevent the
disease where it has not reached.
Many farmers have become aware and can identify it at an early stage. Mr
David Bogere, the vice chairman of Biharwe banana wilt task force in
Mbarara, one way of spreading the disease has been through using tools on
both infected and healthy plants. But taskforces have found a way out. "We
simply rinse tools used on an infected plant in a diluted disinfectant such
as 'jik' or alcohol like 'waragi' or heat them up in fire," says Bogere.
"One cup of 'jik' can be mixed in 5 cups of water and this helps to kill
the bacteria, thus controlling the spread to other plants," he says.
Disease persists
----------------
Mbarara is one of the biggest producers of matooke in the country. It
exports to Rwanda, Tanzania, Burundi, and eastern DR Congo; within
[Uganda], it sells to Soroti, Mbale, and Kampala where the demand is very
high. Despite it being a major cash and food crop in the country, it is
amazing that the disease has persisted since 1999.
Mr Ssetenda explains the delay in eradicating BBWD. "As an NGO, which
started 2 years ago, it took us time to convince farmers about preventive
methods. At first, very few took up the measures but when their plantations
continued drying up, many came to us and now the response is good after
realising the damage the disease can do to bananas," he said.
Part of this reluctance was due to the heavy cost of controlling the
disease. Ssetenda explains the difficulty faced in implementing control
measures. "We lacked cooperation from farmers because many could not accept
to cut down their entire plantation thinking that the disease was just like
any other banana disease." A recurrent problem faced was shortage of
extension workers. Kayunga district has very few extension workers and yet
these people are meant to train farmers and help such vulnerable groups.
Farmers are also advised to avoid moving things like leaves, stems, or even
bananas from places where the disease has been identified. Cutting off the
male bud early using a long dry forked stick also helps and use of
'lusolobyo', a tool where a sickle or knife is attached to a stick used to
cut leaves of the bud is discouraged. "The methods are simple though some
farmers tend to neglect them," says Kibumba.
The disease has affected the social-cultural aspects of the residents in
some of these areas. "I abandoned growing bananas thinking that this
disease would never get any cure because I have never received any
information or someone from the task force telling me about the control
methods," says Ms Nabukeera.
Naro's challenge
----------------
Mr Kibumba taught [Nabukeera] control measures and that is when he realised
they still have a lot of ground to cover. "I am surprised that we still
have some work to accomplish. All along, I have been thinking that the
information about the disease spread to everybody," he says. But apart from
the mechanical methods, Mr Kibumba thinks a modern method should be
developed to control or treat the disease. "I think Naro still has to come
up with some scientific methods which could be used by old people like
Nabukeera who have no helpers and cannot cut the suckers [themselves]."
Until such a method is found Ms Nabukeera and many other farmers all over
the country can only apply existing mechanical methods and pray that
science produces a cure.

[We seem to have further clarification on the issue of which type of banana
wilt -- fungal or bacterial -- is causing the recent concerns in East
Africa (see previous posts listed below). Putting a plant pathology problem
into a social context, this story shows the importance and difficulties of
agricultural liaison work.
