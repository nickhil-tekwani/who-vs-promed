[The above is the official confirmation and notification of the event
reported in ProMED-mail posting 20081107.3494. The 3 affected farms are
located in County Bentheim, Lower Saxony, very close to the border with the
Netherlands and in particular to the BTV-6 affected Dutch province
Overijssel (see the map included in the above notification; zoom in).

It would be interesting to note which clinical signs were observed (the
"Nature of diagnosis" included "Clinical").

The source of the infection and/or the route of its introduction remain,
for the time being, unknown. The epidemiological comment, addressing the EU
approach towards vaccination (against BTV-6?) is somewhat vague; do the
authorities suspect that an uncertified BTV vaccine has been applied
locally? Clarification would help. - Mod.AS]

[BTV-1 was reported from southern Portugal during 2007; its allegedly
confirmed circulation in sheep from a farm located in the region of Alcacer
do Sal [south east of Lisbon] was included in a Spanish report of 21 Jul
2008 (see 20080724.2251). The current discovery of this serotype in
northern Portugal, an area hitherto not affected, means a significant leap
of this virus, which now covers vast areas in the Iberian peninsula and
France. The potential of BTV-1 to expand its spread in Europe has recently
been demonstrated by the discovery of 2 BTV-1 positive cows, imported from
France to the Netherlands through Belgium. According to a press release of
the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture dated 7 Nov 2008, the 2 cows, which were
imported on 8 Oct 2008, have been euthanised following their discovery on a
farm in the Dutch province Gelderland. Animals in the vicinity of the
importing farms are being tested; results will become available during the
coming week. The press release, in Dutch, is available at

[The affected farm is very close to the German border, but no cases of
bluetongue have reportedly been detected in this part of south eastern
Germany (Bavaria). It would be helpful to note the detailed history of the
single positive, non-clinically affected cow, excluding possible past
importation. - Mod.AS]

[The Greek Island Lesvos is close to the Turkish mainland, from where, most
probably, infected vectors (or, though less likely, infected ruminants)
have been introduced. Information on the breed of the affected sheep would
be helpful. The virus may have been circulating for some time in the
region, particularly in Turkey, without being noticed. In the absence of a
considerable serological surveillance, the discovery of BTV activity
depends upon the emergence of observable clinical signs. Such changes/signs
are expected mainly in sheep of susceptible breeds (e.g. Chios dairy sheep).

In contrast with northern, cooler parts of Europe, where _Culicoides_
activity is anticipated to have already peaked, in the eastern
Mediterranean the vectors may still reach their peak activity during
November. Hence, further spread of the virus can not be excluded.

The serotyping of the BTV strain(s) involved are awaited with interest. -
