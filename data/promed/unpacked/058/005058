Some 20 children of the Bocoyna region [Chihuahua state] are suffering the ravages of herpes virus infection. An aggressive outbreak of herpes continues to cause alarm in the community of Santa Elena, in Bocoyna, where the children are presenting with festering sores and scabs on their faces, without being attended to by health authorities, despite the community having requested help 3 months ago. Some of the children are practically unable to eat or sleep because the lesions have extended all over their bodies.

"Between 18 and 20 children are fully infected. It is very serious for some, and they require urgent medical care," said Enoe Carrasco Jordan, secretary of development for the Tarahumara Indigenous Supreme Council. He explained that several foundations and people of good will, some from abroad, have made donations to the Clinic of St Therese of Creel, but that institution charges fees and does not tell donors that they do not cover the indigenous population. "The sick children have gone several times but were not attended to as they should have been because they have no money. There in Santa Elena, it is urgent that a medical team arrive and attend to all, because it seems that this illness is lowering their defenses."

In addition to the visible effects, he said there are other invisible effects which worry them a great deal, and it would be worth a herpes type identification. "It is tragic to see children be so affected with such painful wounds, particularly when eating, laughing, running, sleeping, etc, because they hurt and bleed, so we feel that this is more important than any pipeline or airport. Deplorable situations like this exist in the mountains, but fixing them would be costly.

[ProMED-mail thanks Kathryn Soderholm for this report and for the following comments:

"It is noteworthy that it is an indigenous population that is affected. The fact that this appears to be happening in a small, isolated village in the middle of the mountains makes the problem more expensive to deal with, but the issue is probably more that the indigenous tribes of Mexico are generally in a much worse state in terms of social and legal acknowledgement and recognition (and money) than those in the US, Alaska, and Canada."

It is unclear from this description that herpes simplex virus infection is the cause of this situation. No details of the diagnosis and treatment are provided. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections are very common worldwide. HSV-1 is the main cause of herpes infections on the mouth and lips, including cold sores and fever blisters. It is transmitted through kissing or sharing drinking utensils. HSV-1 can also cause genital herpes, although HSV-2 is the main cause of genital herpes. HSV-2 is spread through sexual contact. You may be infected with HSV-1 or HSV-2 but not show any symptoms. Often symptoms are triggered by exposure to the sun, fever, menstruation, emotional stress, a weakened immune system, or an illness.

There is no cure for herpes, and once you have it, it is likely to come back. However, some people may have one outbreak and then never have another one. In between herpes outbreaks, the virus lies dormant (as if it is hibernating or sleeping) in nerve cells. Exposure to HSV-1 is extremely common -- as many as 90 per cent of American adults have been exposed to the virus.

While most herpes infections do not cause serious complications, infections in infants and in people with weakened immune systems or herpes infections that affect the eyes can be life threatening. Further information would be welcomed. - Mod.CP

The above news report describes an outbreak of painful, bleeding sores and scabs on the faces of indigenous Mexican children (age not specified) that in some children spread over the entire body and that have interfered with eating, laughing, running, or sleeping. The news report says that the sores have been attributed to herpes (presumably herpes simplex) virus (HSV) infection, but fails to say how this diagnosis was made.

HSV causes several different syndromes. HSV infection most commonly causes clusters of inflamed, small, painful blisters on the skin that eventually break open. In children and adults, HSV can cause sores around the mouth or face (orofacial herpes); sores on the genitals (genital herpes); or on the hands (herpetic whitlow). Initial orofacial herpes may be more severe -- involving the oral mucosa and gingiva (primary herpetic gingivostomatitis) -- than recurrent infection, which causes small blisters mainly on the lips (herpes labialis). In the newborn, contact with infected maternal genital secretions at the time of delivery may cause: 1) skin, eye and mouth disease; 2) encephalitis; or 3) disseminated infection (multiple organ system involvement, including lung, liver, adrenal glands, eye, and the brain, sepsis, as well as disseminated cutaneous lesions). In immunocompromised individuals, HSV can also cause multiple organ and cutaneous dissemination.

Multiple HSV skin infections also can occur in immunocompetent individuals as a result of skin-to-skin contact with HSV-infected sites on another individual or autoinoculation (self-infection). Cutaneous or ocular infection (keratitis, conjunctivitis, and blepharitis) that occurs among athletes involved in contact sports is called herpes gladiatorum. The infection is often accompanied by lymphadenopathy (enlargement of the lymph nodes), fever, sore throat, and headache. One of the largest outbreaks of herpes gladiatorum occurred in 60 of 175 high school wrestlers attending a four-week intensive-training camp in 1989 (http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199109263251302). Also see: http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00001552.htm.

Other causes of skin infections that must be excluded include impetigo, caused by _Staphylococcus aureus_ or group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus; cutaneous leishmaniasis, caused by leishmania parasites, which are spread by the bite of infected sand flies; and ringworm caused by a skin fungus. - Mod.ML
