Infectious Haematopoietic Necrosis in The United States of America in a
salmon hatchery (additional information)
See also: 28 Jun 2002
Information received on 12 Jul 2002 from Dr Peter Fernandez, Associate
Deputy Administrator, International Services, United States Department of
Agriculture (USDA), Washington, DC:
End of previous report period: 21 Jun 2002 (see Disease Information, 15
[26], 107, dated 28 Jun 2002).
End of this report period: 12 Jul 2002.
On the affected premises, in addition to sockeye salmon (_Oncorhynchus
nerka_) and steelhead (_O. mykiss_), there were juvenile coho salmon (_O.
kisutch_) and chinook salmon (_O. tshawytscha_). No fish of these 2 species
was affected with infectious haematopoietic necrosis (IHN) virus and most
have been released.
The following is a breakdown of these fish populations on site:
Upriver Bright Fall Chinook
4 445 508
Umatilla Fall Chinook
4 045 800
Coho Salmon
1 100 000
Summer Steelhead
117 200
Winter Steelhead
60 400
Routine mortalities from each of these groups were examined for IHN virus
prior to release or transfer of fish. No virus was found in any of these
groups. Virus assays are performed following the standards outlined in the
American Fisheries Society Fish Health Section Blue Book. These standards
are designed to detect pathogens at a 5 percent prevalence in populations
of over 2000 fish. The testing conducted on the Steelhead and Fall Chinook
lots was done at a 1 percent prevalence and, as mentioned above, no virus
was detected.
