A mallard duck farm near the North Jutland town of Nibe has been infected with a low pathogenic poultry type of avian influenza H5N2, according to the Danish veterinary and food administration Fodevarestyrelsen.

An entire flock of 1200 ducklings will be killed to prevent the virus from spreading. All hobby duck shooting within the zone is only allowed with permission from the veterinary administration.

The infection was discovered during a routine inspection carried out as part of prevention efforts against Avian influenza. Just 2 weeks ago, an [LPAI H7N7] case was reported at Brenderup farm in western Funen, where 3000 ducklings had to be put down because of the virus.

[The new LPAI H5N2 outbreak described above has been reported to the OIE on 8 Aug 2016 by the chief veterinary officer, Danish Veterinary and Food Administration, Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries. The report, including an interactive map, is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=20704.

According to the OIE report, the causal agent is "low pathogenic avian influenza virus, serotype H5N2". The manifestation of the disease is "sub-clinical infection". The date of previous occurrence of LPAI H5N2 in Denmark is 27 Jun 2013. The date of start of the current event is 2 Aug 2016, confirmed 6 Aug 2016.

The report includes the following description of the affected population: "The farm breeds game birds (mallards) for hunting purposes. On 2 Aug 2016, samples were collected in connection with the Danish surveillance programme for avian influenza. On 6 Aug 2016, LPAI H5 was detected in these samples. All 1200 birds (approximate number) on the holding will be killed and destroyed".

The previous outbreak in Denmark, in late July, affected 3 week old mallard ducklings, similarly bred for hunting. It was caused by LPAI H7N7 (thus not "similar"). - Mod.AS
