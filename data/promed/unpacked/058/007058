The State Secretary of Health for Rio de Janeiro reported that up to 17
April 1998 the city of Rio recorded 2,285 cases, Volta Redonda 3,349, and
the beach resort of Buzios 420. In Buzios 100 agents of the National
Health Foundation and 30 soldiers are working on dengue control with the
help of spray trucks. Elsewhere in the State the situation appears to be
stabilizing.
Dengue hemorrhagic fever
------------------------
So far during April, 9 cases of DHF have been recorded in the State, the
same number as in the whole of March.
Ground spraying
---------------
This will start in most parts of the city of Rio next Monday morning, 20
April, and be continued on Wednesday, Thursday & Friday (there will be no
spraying on Tuesday).
[Today we were on the island of Paqueta, in the Bay of Guanabara offshore
from Rio, which was sprayed this morning. Grasshoppers and other insects
were staggering around on the ground in their death throes - Mod.JW
Elsewhere in Brazil
-------------------
Ex-President Jose Sarney and 3 members of his family are reportedly sick
with dengue in Brasilia. His illness puts in question his attendance at a
Council of World Interaction which he has organized to discuss the impact
of the Asian economic crisis on Latin America. He believes he contracted
the illness in Sao Luis de Maranhao (MA), a state in the north of Brazil.
