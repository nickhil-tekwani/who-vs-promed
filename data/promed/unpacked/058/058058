There seems to be a minor error concerning the interpretation of the
diagnostic properties of the IDEXX HerdChek for CWD. A sensitivity
of 98.8 percent and specificity of 100 percent would suggest no
false-positive results, but a small proportion of false-negative
results.
Perfect specificity would be a little unusual given the nature of the
detection platform. I tend to be cautious when interpreting
sensitivity and specificity estimates independent of information
concerning the sample size, sample selection, and gold standard
determination.

[ProMED-mail appreciates Dr. Fosgate's correction and agrees with his
caution regarding the manufacturer's claim of perfect specificity. -
