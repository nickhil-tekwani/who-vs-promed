Each 5th tick, which has been investigated in the laboratory of the Latvian Infectology Centre, contains _Borrelia_ or the initiator of Lyme disease, Latvian Television reported [14 Jul 2021]. Only 2% of the ticks tested were infected with tick encephalitis [virus]. It doesn't mean that everyone who gets these ticks inevitably gets sick. But medics remind the public to be careful outdoors and take suitable precautions when in areas potentially containing ticks.

727 ticks have been removed by [11 Jul 2021] at Riga East Clinical University Hospital (RAKUS). Not all removed ticks are analyzed as it is a paid-for service.

Tick encephalitis is an acute central nervous system disease. The most serious cases end up with death or disability, and may also include headache, fatigue, trouble balancing or other consequences.

Of the tick tested, 3 or 1.7% were positive for encephalitis [virus] in the laboratory from a total of 176 ticks. That number varies every year. In 2015, 5% were infected, 4% in 2016, and in 2018 and 2019 only 0.65% and 0.82% of all ticks tested [were positive for the virus].

Baiba Rozentale, chief doctor of the Infectology Center, explained: "[Infection] with tick-borne encephalitis virus is increasing. Let's see what the dynamics will be. We can only say that we have 6 patients at the moment; 4 have been cured. At present, more people are near the sea and sand, there is less access to [ticks]. See what autumn will be."

Meanwhile, Lyme disease agents are found more frequently in ticks this year. There were 213 ticks investigated for _Borrelia_, with 40 or 18.8% infected.

A vaccine is available against tick-borne encephalitis [virus] and can therefore protect people. "That can't be said about Lyme borreliosis, where there is no vaccine. It is therefore important to find out whether the tick was infected and whether the borreliosis went over to the person," noted Sergejs Nikisins, head of the Reference Laboratory of the Center.

Even if the tick is infected, much depends on how long the insect is attached, because it is not always and not immediately that the pathogen from the tick comes into human blood.

Rozentale said: "But people should be calm, because we have only one patient in the hospital with an early form [of Lyme disease?] that needs to be treated. Local treatment is outpatient. But most don't get sick. Because the skin and subcutaneous cells catch the agent and the person does not get sick."

Doctors nevertheless remind that you should be careful and check your and your children's bodies after going out in nature.

Long trousers tucked into socks while passing through long grass or undergrowth, tick repellent sprays and regular checks to see if any ticks are crawling towards the fleshier parts of the body that they prefer are all sensible precautions.

[Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) has been diagnosed in Latvia before. Dr. Berger earlier commented that, "... a marked peak in incidence of cases per 100 000 population [occurred] between 1994-1999, with lower, but constant, incidence rates thereafter." He added that changes in rates of TBE incidence in both Latvia and Estonia could be due to a variety of factors (see ProMED-mail post Tick-borne encephalitis virus - Latvia (02): comment 20170523.5057586).

Cases of the European TBE subtype occur in Central and Western Europe. Finding tick-borne encephalitis virus in the ticks reported above is a warning that the transmission season is underway. Tick-borne encephalitis is a viral infection caused by one of 3 tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) subtypes belonging to the _Flaviviridae_ family: Central European, Siberian, and Far Eastern (formerly known as Russian spring-summer encephalitis). The Central European subtype is found in Latvia. It is transmitted to humans there through the bite of infected sheep ticks, _Ixodes ricinus_. The WHO states, "Approximately 10 000-12 000 clinical cases of tick-borne encephalitis are reported each year, but this figure is believed to be significantly lower than the actual total. Immunization offers the most effective protection. Currently, there are 4 widely used vaccines of assured quality: FSME-Immun and Encepur, manufactured in Austria and Germany respectively, and based on European strains of the virus; and TBE-Moscow and EnceVir, manufactured in the Russian Federation and based on Far- Eastern strains. The 4 vaccines are considered to be safe and efficacious."

Although this is the 1st Lyme disease report in Latvia that ProMED-mail has posted, there have been previous reports in the Baltic area. In 2007, Dr. Steve Berger stated that Lyme disease is extremely common in the Baltic region. In fact, disease rates are severalfold higher in this area than in the USA (see graph at http://exhibit.gideononline.com/Lyme-Baltic.jpg (see Lyme disease - Estonia (Saaremaa) (02): background 20070625.2048). - Mod.TY
