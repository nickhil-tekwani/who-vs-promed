SYPHILIS (5)
============
This is a truly fascinating topic [false negatives in syphilis serology,
and the suggestion that cocaine could cause false-negative reactions:
promed archive.960316], but I gather that very little is known about it.
Therefore, I'm curious if Kathleen Toomey (or other subscribers) could
provide us with more information about the evidence that lead to
the conclusion that cocaine was causing the false negative results.
Was it simply because all or most of the false-negative patients had
cocaine in their blood?
Also, I've done a newspaper search on the subject of cocaine
and syphilis; a quick perusal showed that there was some
opinion that the link between sexual promiscuity and crack-cocaine
use leads to a higher incidence of syphilis, among
other diseases, in crack users. This was mostly in connection to
the recent syphilis epidemic in Ohio (with another recent study done
in rural North Carolina.)
Has there been any consideration that the link may therefore
be a behavioral side-effect of the drug, rather than the drug
itself?

[It would also be interesting to know whether there are reports of
false-negative results, attributed to cocaine, in other serologic tests
