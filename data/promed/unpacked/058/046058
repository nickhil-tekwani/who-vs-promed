The Division of Communicable Diseases Control in the Dhi Qar Health Department announced unprecedented rates of [infection with Crimean-Congo] hemorrhagic fever, and has called for the activation of veterinary measures to prevent the spread of the disease.

The local government accused the Ministry of Agriculture of not providing resources for the control of parasitic insects that carry [the Crimean-Congo] hemorrhagic fever. Haider Ali Hantoush, Director of the Communicable Diseases Control Division, told Al-Mada that "since the middle of last year 2021 until today [25 Apr 2022], unprecedented and unexpected rates of [the Crimean-Congo] hemorrhagic fever have been recorded", noting that the total infections (cases) amounted to 30, including 10 deaths during the same period."

Hantoush added that "the infections have resulted in 16 cases and 7 deaths during the 2nd half of 2021, 14 confirmed cases and 3 deaths during the first 3rd of 2022," stressing that "deaths constitute a 3rd of the number of the infected." He pointed out that "infections with hemorrhagic fever increased during the past year [2021] and the current year [2022]," revealing that "the last case and death recorded in the past was in 2018, while the years 2019, 2020 and the first half of 2021 did not witness any infection."

Hantoush pointed out that "infections began to escalate during the 2nd half of 2021 and have continued so far to record unprecedented rates." He stressed that "[the Crimean-Congo] hemorrhagic fever is a serious disease with a death rate of 40%."

Regarding the ways of transmission of the disease, Hantoush said, "The disease is a viral disease of animal origin and is transmitted in particular through livestock, as animals are considered carriers of the disease and are not affected much by it. Those who deal with animal meat are [can be] infected, as it is transmitted through it." Hantoush also added "the groups most vulnerable to infection are livestock breeders and butchers, in addition to those who deal with meat from infected livestock" stressing that "some women were infected as a result of cutting fresh meat from an infected animal." The infections [cases] recorded this year [2022] are distributed among the districts of Suq Al-Shuyoukh, Al-Rifai, Ur district, and one case in the Al-Thawra area in Nasiriyah.

Regarding preventive and curative measures, Hantoush commented, "The governorate's administration has previously formed a committee to follow up on [the Crimean-Congo] hemorrhagic fever, headed by the assistant governor, Abbas Al-Khuzai, the departments of veterinary, agriculture, municipalities, health, environment and the police command," stressing that "an integrated isolation ward has been allocated for infected patients in Al-Hussein Teaching Hospital."

Hantoush indicated that "the 1st preventive measure is to control the tick, which is the 1st carrier of the disease", noting that "this measure is currently unavailable because the aforementioned insect control materials were not sufficiently made available by the Ministry of Agriculture."

The assistant governor of Dhi Qar for planning affairs, who heads the agricultural committee in Dhi Qar, Faisal Al-Sharifi, told Al-Mada, that "the veterinary departments have taken measures to limit the foci of infection for the purpose of controlling the disease and limiting its transmission," noting that "the main problem lies in the fact that the disease is a communicable disease."

Regarding the failure to provide materials to combat the tick that transmits the disease, Al-Sharifi said that "providing and importing materials involved in combating this insect is one of the exclusive prerogatives of the Ministry of Agriculture and local governments have no right to import them." Al-Sharifi stressed that "the ministry has not provided them yet, and the local government's budget does not provide for the purchase of these materials." He noted, "The Ministry of Agriculture asks the governorates to provide money for this purpose and deposit it in the ministry's account so that it can buy them and then distribute them to the governorates, and this is a long process and not consistent with the requirements of the emergency situation that relates to people's lives."

Al-Sharifi revealed that "the ministerial restrictions are very complicated and the high rates of infection require quick and urgent measures to limit the spread and exacerbation of the disease."

He urged "the Ministry of Agriculture to take immediate measures to provide materials to control the insects that transmit the disease, because the disease can be transmitted even through the bite of stray dogs, and here lies the danger", he said.

The director of the veterinary hospital in Dhi Qar, Imad Diab Al-Nassar, revealed a number of measures taken by the crisis cell recently formed by the governorate to limit the transmission of the disease. Diab spoke to Al-Mada about "taking a number of decisions, including the restrictions on the entry and exit of animals to and from the governorate" as well as not to move animals from endemic areas to healthy ones." He pointed out that "a decision was taken to combat random slaughter and to limit the process of slaughtering livestock to official slaughterhouses."

Yesterday, Sunday [24 Apr 2022], the Dhi Qar Health Department confirmed the continuation of the crisis cell formed by the governor to work on the control of the hemorrhagic fever, while calling for the intervention of the security forces to implement isolation measures in the affected areas.

The director of the Public Health Department in the Dhi Qar Health Department, Hussein Riyad, said in an interview with Al-Mada, that "the governorate recorded 24 cases last year [2021], including 9 deaths, while the current year [2022] witnessed the registration of 8 cases, including 3 deaths."

Riyadh added, "The suspected cases are sampled and examined in the central laboratory in Baghdad," noting that "we have in the Dhi Qar Health Department one isolation hall, and are working to develop it during the coming period."

He added that "the affected areas must be isolated in order to stop the [spread the infection of the] hemorrhagic fever" noting that "we need the intervention of the security forces to implement isolation measures and help protect citizens from disease."

The director of the Public Health Department in Dhi Qar added that "the governorate is complaining about the lack of a modern and sanitary slaughterhouse, which made diseases spread quickly." Riyadh indicated that "the crisis cell formed by the governor is working to control the disease", pointing out that "there are other efforts being made by the veterinary medicine that follows up on the cases of the animals that transmit this disease to humans."

Saif al-Badr, a spokesman for the Ministry of Health, told the official Iraqi News Agency (INA) that Sick Bleeding fever [cases] has left 18 wounded and 4 dead across Iraq.

Al-Badr called on the people to "be vigilant and follow preventive measures to avoid this dangerous disease."

Many viruses cause hemorrhagic fever, and the disease can sometimes be simple, but sometimes it can be life threatening if it is known to be transmitted to humans from certain animals and insects, and the infection can be transmitted from one person to another.

Most of the injuries [infections] are concentrated in the Dhi Qar Governorate in the south of the country, where the ministry announced on Monday [25 Apr 2022] that it would send a high-level team led by the director general of the public health department. Measures were taken in collaboration with the local government in the governorate, ministries and other bodies.

Experts say the Garh has registered 30 cases since the middle of last year [2021], with 10 deaths, and officials involved in the governorate have launched a campaign to control the red meat markets.

Audit campaigns
---------------
A statement from the health media said, "Health control groups in the Nazarene First Division are continuing their control campaigns to pursue meat shops that sell red meat in markets and neighborhoods to Shamia." These measures are preventive conditions necessary for the health and safety of citizens.

A veterinarian at the governorate said, "The disease started to spread last year [2021] and many deaths and sicknesses were recorded in the city and other cities, but it is strange that the official procedures of the Ministry of Health have not been implemented. There is a need nationally to combat the disease and strengthen veterinary services with basic materials, initiating monitoring committees to monitor animal slaughterhouses and complying with safety recommendations."

The doctor, who did not want to be named, told Sky News Arabia, "The disease is not dangerous in its early stages, but if it spreads rapidly, it will be difficult to control and prevent, especially in the absence of the necessary vaccine."

In the same vein, several Iraqi governorates have announced rapid measures to prevent the spread of the disease and its spread.

Kirkuk Governorate Health Director Nabil Hamdi said, "The Governorate will launch a campaign to prevent hemorrhagic fever, especially after the outbreak of the disease in Dhi Qar Governorate."

He stressed in a press release that "the investigation into the issue of hemorrhagic fever in Kirkuk is ongoing and we will conduct a workshop to spread awareness and culture about the spread of the disease among the people in the province. So far, no case has been registered in the province."

According to the World Health Organization, the mortality rate for hemorrhagic fever reaches 40% of victims.

The virus is transmitted to humans through poultry or livestock, infecting a person through direct contact with blood, secretions, organs, or other body fluids.

Some types of viral hemorrhagic fevers: Dengue Fever, Ebola Fever, Lassa Fever, Marburg Fever and Yellow Fever.

It should be noted that there is no cure for viral hemorrhagic fevers, but some of them have vaccines, while prevention is the best way to combat them until scientists find additional vaccines.

Iraq officially recorded the 1st death in 2018 from the disease.

[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is a widespread disease caused by a tick-borne virus (Nairovirus) of the Bunyaviridae family. The CCHF virus causes severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40%.

Animals become infected by the bite of infected ticks and the virus remains in their bloodstream for about one week after infection, allowing the tick-animal-tick cycle to continue when another tick bites. Although a number of tick genera are capable of becoming infected with CCHF virus, ticks of the genus _Hyalomma_ are the principal vector.

The disease has been endemic to Iraq since 1979, with a few sporadic cases reported across the country. At times, small outbreaks have been reported, with the last outbreak happening in 2021 with 18 cases confirmed in Dhi Qar and Nineveh Governorates. (http://www.emro.who.int/pandemic-epidemic-diseases/news/who-builds-capacity-of-rapid-response-team-in-iraq-with-a-focus-on-crimean-congo-haemorrhagic-fever.html)

In early April 2022, the Public Health Department in Dhi Qar announced recording about 20 cases of hemorrhagic fever in the governorate since the beginning of 2022 and on 20 Apr 2022, the 1st laboratory-confirmed death was reported in Al-Meshkhab district in Al-Najaf governorate.

It is important to raise awareness about the risk factors of the disease, particularly in the population groups likely to be exposed to the virus, and educate them to take precautionary measures to reduce exposure to the virus, such as wearing gloves and protective clothing while handling animals.

Furthermore, appropriate capacity building and training of public health rapid response teams (RRT) should be carried out in order to equip them to control any future outbreaks of this anthropo-zoonotic disease. - Mod.UBA
