Sri Lanka: Undiagnosed Disease Responsible for Six Deaths in South
-----------------------------------------------------------------
COLOMBO: The Sri Lankan Epidemiology Unit stated on Fri 17 Dec 2004
that.six people have died so far in an outbreak of an unknown disease
suspected to be caused by viral infection, which is spreading in the south
of Sri Lanka. The Unit said that up to the present, the disease suspected
to be the result of viral infection has not yet been identified and the
cause remained unknown.
The deaths were reported from the Matara and Embilipitiya districts in the
south of Sri Lanka where a large number of other cases have already [been
admitted] to infectious disease hospitals, the Unit said. Meanwhile, the
Unit said blood samples from infected persons have been sent to the Medical
Research Institute for further analysis and special medical officers from
the Unit are scheduled to visit these areas.

[The identity and seriousness of the outbreak is difficult to determine
since no denominator is given. It may be relevant that the World Health
Organisation issued an alert on 2 Sep 2004 due to a resurgence of cases of
dengue virus infection in the [south Asian] region, noting outbreaks in
Bhutan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka. Further information is
awaited. - Mod.CP]
