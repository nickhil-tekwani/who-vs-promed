2 primary school children have died and nearly 100 have been treated in
hospital after contracting a "mysterious" disease, Beeld newspaper reported
on Fri, 9 Sep 2005. The children come from Mahlodumela Primary School in
Chebeng village near Polokwane, the capital of Limpopo province.
Phuti Seloba, spokesman for the Limpopo health department, was quoted as
saying the cause of the illness was still a mystery. The pupils showed
symptoms of nausea, diarrhea and exhaustion. A 9 year old and a 10 year old
died of the disease, the newspaper reported.
Another 63 pupils were taken to Seshego Hospital near Polokwane, where they
were treated. Most had been discharged.
It was initially thought the pupils had contracted meningitis and tests
were done. However, Seloba said the tests were negative. "Several other
tests were done and we are awaiting the results. We don't want to guess
about the cause of the illness and cause panic."
Ndo Mangala, spokesman for the Limpopo education department, said some
parents suspected their children caught food poisoning after eating meals
distributed through a feeding scheme. However, food poisoning had also been
eliminated, "as it was not the food that ... caused the illness," according
to Mangala.

[ProMED-mail would like more information about this outbreak. With the
etiology of this gastroenteritis-like illness not yet known, it would seem
premature to eliminate a foodborne source. - Mod.LL]
