A mystery disease, which has killed 4 children in less than 10 days
on Marajo Island [in the mouth of the Amazon river] has claimed a 5th
victim. A 4-year-old girl has been hospitalized on a respirator in
intensive care in Belem [Para state's capital], slipping in and out
of consciousness. She is the sister of one of the children who died
last week, and according to her family she had a high fever, vomiting
and convulsions, symptoms, which suggest malaria or meningitis. Last
year [2006], half the rural inhabitants of the region suffered from malaria.
Preliminary laboratory tests by the Instituto Evandro Chagas [IEC,
the national reference center for arboviruses] did not establish a
diagnosis, but since yesterday [3 Sep 2007] a team from IEC and the
[Para] State Secretariat for Public Health (Sespa) are at the site
looking for possible insect vectors of disease.

[It should be noted that the region has been suffering outbreaks of
vampire bat rabies. - Mod.LJS]
[As mentioned by Mod.LJS, the region is one where there have been
outbreaks of vampire bat rabies (see prior ProMED-mail postings below
on earlier outbreaks of rabies in humans associated with vampire
bats). If this were due to rabies one would expect reports of
dysphagia [difficulty in swallowing] as a predominant presenting
symptom (see Ministry of Health, Brazil report on outbreak of vampire
bat associated rabies in Para 2005, signs and symptoms bar graph on
page 2, available at
<http://portal.saude.gov.br/portal/arquivos/pdf/raiva2806.pdf>, where
100 percent of patients presented with dysphagia.) The newswire is
also correct when it mentions that the symptoms described can be
associated with meningitis or malaria (cerebral malaria), malaria
being endemic in the aforementioned region as well. ProMED-mail would
greatly appreciate more information from knowledgeable sources in the region.
