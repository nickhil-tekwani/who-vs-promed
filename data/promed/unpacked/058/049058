West Virginia wildlife officials say a late-summer outbreak of an often-fatal deer disease has killed hundreds of Mountain State whitetails.

Jim Crum, deer project leader for the state Division of Natural Resources, said hunters and landowners have been finding carcasses of deer killed by epizootic hemorrhagic disease.

"This year's [2012] EHD outbreak is not nearly as prevalent or widespread as the one we had in 2007," Crum said. "So far, we've had confirmed mortality in Calhoun, Jefferson, Greenbrier, Hancock, Mason, Monroe and Pleasants counties. I don't have an accurate count right now, but the numbers are in the hundreds and not the thousands."

The disease, caused by a particular species of biting aquatic insect called a "midge," often occurs during the late stages of a hot, dry summer.

"Deer get hot and thirsty, and they go to streams and ponds to drink or cool off. Wet places like that are breeding grounds for the midges. When the midges bite the deer, they transmit the EHD virus," Crum explained.

Many deer that are bitten never contract the disease, but those that contract it often die from it.

"The mortality rate is pretty high," Crum said. "When it hits an area, the results are pretty obvious. We've had calls from concerned landowners telling us they've found 11 dead deer here, or 13 dead deer there."

Though hunters and landowners often refer to EHD as "blue tongue," Crum said the 2 diseases are not the same. "The viruses are similar, but what we have here is not blue tongue," he explained. "We have EHD serotype 2. Deer can get it, but cattle and humans cannot."

Cooler weather should end an outbreak of hemorrhagic disease that has killed hundreds of deer along the base of eastern slopes of North Carolina's northwestern mountain counties and in the foothills. The virus is spread by midges, tiny biting flies or gnats, and fall freezes usually kill the insects. The disease can't be transmitted to humans.

The outbreak hasn't led to any changes in the season's hunting regulations, but wildlife officials want hunters to be aware of it.

Bow hunting season opened the 1st weekend of September [2012] in northwest North Carolina. Muzzleloader and gun seasons open next month [November 2012].

Symptoms exhibited by infected deer can vary widely, including swelling in the head and tongue and hemorrhages and lesions in the heart, mouth and stomach. Deer seeking relief from high fever go in search of water, and carcasses have often been found near streams or ponds.

It's a common disease among deer, but the number of deer affected in the outbreak has been unusual, said Chris Kreh, a biologist with the N.C. Wildlife Resources Commission. The disease thinned out some overpopulated locations, but hunters may choose to voluntarily limit harvests in hard-hit areas. "If your goal is to help the herd rebound as quickly as possible on your property, that would be the thing to do," Kreh said.

About 300 affected deer have been reported in Wilkes County, but the number is likely higher because not every carcass is found and reported. The deer population has been hit hardest in Caldwell County north of N.C. 18; in Wilkes, roughly north of U.S. 421; and in Surry County west of Interstate 77.

A survey by wildlife officials last month [September 2012] showed the number of reported cases at 448 in Caldwell County, 177 in Wilkes, and 139 in Surry, compared with 6 reported cases in Yadkin and none in Forsyth County.

The outbreak was 1st noticed in the Yadkin River corridor in June and July [2012]. About 20 dead deer were found in Stone Mountain State Park in Wilkes County in July [2012], but no similar outbreaks were noted in other state parks, said Charlie Peek, a spokesman for the N.C. Division of Parks and Recreation. Staff members at Stone Mountain State Park removed deer carcasses from trails and water sources near visitor areas, but they didn't go into more remote areas where the number could have been higher, Peek said.

Wildlife officials don't yet know the region's deer mortality rate, but during past outbreaks in other places, it was 30 percent to 50 percent of the herd. The numbers in northwest North Carolina could be in that range, Kreh said, and officials will have a better idea once this year's [2012] hunting season concludes.

The spread of the disease is associated with the number of disease-carrying insects. Last winter's [2011-2012] mild weather, coupled with an early spring and lower stream levels, helped create favorable breeding conditions for midges. The disease is not uncommon, but it often afflicts herds in the eastern part of the state. The local outbreak could have been made worse by the severity of the virus strain and a herd's lack of immunity.

Wildlife officials plan to continue closely monitoring deer populations in the area, and they expect a high mortality rate. "We started with a really good, strong, robust deer population," Kreh said. "There's a lot of reason to be optimistic the deer can rebound quickly.

On 11 Sep 2012, the agency [Pennsylvania Game Commission] received the carcass of a female deer that had died on the grounds of the Graterford State Correctional Institute, Skippack Township. The deer was one of 19 found to date by the prison's mounted patrol. The deer carcasses were in various stages of decay, and the majority of the deer were found near water.

Tissue samples were submitted to and tested by the Southeast Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study (SCWDS) at the University of Georgia, which has confirmed the deer mortality was due to a strain of the EHD virus.

"There are no management actions or practices to prevent or limit mortality caused by EHD," Dr. Cottrell said. "Fortunately, EHD should be curtailed with the 1st hard frost, which will kill the midges that are spreading the disease. EHD is a seasonal disease, and the affected local deer herd can rebound quickly."

EHD is one of the most common diseases among white-tailed deer in the United States and is contracted by the bite of insects called "midges" or "no-see-ums." The virus of EHD usually kills the animal within 5 to 10 days, and is not spread directly from deer to deer. While EHD is not infectious to humans, deer displaying severe symptoms of EHD may not be suitable for consumption.

The Game Commission will continue to gather samples from other dead deer being found in Pennsylvania outside of municipalities where it already has been confirmed. Samples must be collected within 24 hours of the animal's death to be viable. Once the results are available, which normally takes around 2 weeks, the Game Commission will release the findings to the public.

In addition to Montgomery County, EHD already has been confirmed this year [2012] in Allegheny, Beaver, and Westmoreland counties, and is suspected in Cambria and Crawford counties. SCWDS has confirmed deer mortalities from 4 different strains of the EHD virus in 15 states this year [2012].

EHD is the most important disease of white-tailed deer. Outbreaks are common in many USA states. However, the magnitude of the outbreaks depends on climatic factors that influence the fitness of the vector. This year (2012), the outbreaks appear to be more severe than usual in some states.
