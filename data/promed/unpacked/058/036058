Numerous children who had contracted hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) are being taken to hospital only after [the disease was] diagnosed at grade 3 or grade 4 [see comment below on grading]. HFMD can affect the lungs, a doctor has warned. Dr Truong Huu Khanh, head of HCM [Ho Chi Minh] City Paediatrics Hospitals No 1's Neurology and Infectious Diseases ward, said that parents should learn the signs of the disease and take their children to the hospital for treatment early. "Parents easily understand the disease when the symptoms are a sore throat or a fever," he said.

On 15 Sep 2015, nearly 56 children who had contracted HFMD were admitted to the ward. The doctor said common signs include fever, reduced appetite, sore throat and rash on hands, feet and diaper area. "A serious case being treated at the ward is a 15-month-old baby from District 11, HCM City. The baby was taken to hospital 3 days ago when she was diagnosed at grade 3, with high fever, and rash on the mouth. Now she can breastfeed." Khanh said.

Hand-foot-mouth disease is a common viral illness among children under the age of 3 years, especially those between 6 months and 12 months, who contract the disease easily and their condition deteriorates rapidly. The disease peaks during 2 periods, from March to May, and from September to November, he said. "It is very important that everyone wash their hands with soap and water, and clean and disinfect toys and floors frequently as the disease is transmitted via the digestive system," he added.

HCM City Paediatrics Hospitals No 1 reported that the number of patients with HFMD increased rapidly over the last month [mid-Aug to mid-Sept 2015]. There were 126 cases in July, 242 cases in August, and 131 cases during the 1st 9 days of September.

[Regarding grading of HFMD, from the Academia website:
"Grade 1 is uncomplicated fever along with rash on the hands, feet and mouth; grade 2 shows twitching in the ﬁngers indicating nervous system afﬂiction. In Grade 3 disease manifests with more serious symptoms: persistent fever, lethargy, irritability, limb weakness, meningism, and seizure. Grade 4 is the most serious level of disease, presenting with cardiorespiratory compromise. Grading is useful for deciding treatment options: child presenting with grade 2 should be hospitalized and carefully observed for further progression. At grade 3 and 4, the child's life is seriously at risk, and intensive care becomes a necessity."

Hand, foot and mouth disease can be caused by several distinct viruses. No information is provided in this report, and it is unclear whether more than a single infectious agent is responsible for the differing severity of the responses. Reports from other countries in the region suggest that Coxsackievirus A16 is the predominant agent. Further information would be appreciated. - Mod.CP
