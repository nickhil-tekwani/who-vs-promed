Boy Dies of Bird Flu in Indonesia
------------------------------------------
An 8-year-old Indonesian boy has died of bird
flu. Health officials there say the child's
neighbors kept chickens and they are
investigating to see if those birds are infected.
The death toll from the disease is now 97 in
Indonesia, which has suffered more bird flu fatalities than any other country.

The World Health Organization (WHO) says more
than 200 people have died from the bird flu virus
since its discovery in Asia in 2003. [As of 18
Jan 2008 the WHO Table of confirmed cases gives
the number of cases as 350 and the number of deaths as 218;
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2008_01_18/en/>
- Mod.CP]. Researchers fear the virus could
mutate and become transmittable between humans.

Indonesia's resort island of Bali will play host
to the Sixth International Bird Flu Summit in
March [2008]. Scientists, emergency responders
and poultry industry leaders will meet to discuss the situation.

[It is unclear from this report whether this
records the death of a 12-year-old boy admitted
to hospital on 8 Jan 2008 as a suspected case
(see: Avian influenza, human (04): Indonesia,
susp. 20080109.0121), or is a different,
previously unrecorded case. Clarification is awaited. - Mod.CP]
