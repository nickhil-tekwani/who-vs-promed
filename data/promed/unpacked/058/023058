Cases of African swine fever have been found in the Kardzhali [Kurdzhali] region. Antibodies to the disease were detected in 15 samples. The cases were detected in the state forest hunting farms in Ardino, Krumovgrad and Kirkovo, as well as in the Zhenda farm. These are the first cases of the disease in several years, said the regional director of the Bulgarian Food Safety Agency (BFSA) Dr Ali Durmushali.

"We are constantly in contact with the hunting teams and the state forestry, where they monitor the clinical manifestations of the disease itself, and if there are, then other measures will be taken. This is just one type of disease that is normal in nature. The last one closest to us was in the Asenovgrad region."

According to local hunters, the disease was most likely transmitted from neighboring areas of Kardzhali.

ASF has been circulating in Bulgaria since Sept 2018, affecting both wild boar and domestic pigs. In 3 of its regions, the virus found its way into holdings of domestic pigs: Varna, Pazardzhik and Plovdiv.

Bulgaria's most recent report to EU's PAFF (plants, animals, food, feed) "Animal Health and Welfare Committee" (SCoPAFF), addressing its ASF situation, was presented on 23 Oct 2021 (https://ec.europa.eu/food/system/files/2021-10/reg-com_ahw_20211020_asf_bgr.pdf).

According to the said report, the following outbreaks have been recorded in domestic pigs as of 22 Oct 2021 (slide 2):
No / Region / Last event / Category / No pigs
1 / Varna /19 Jul 2021/ East-Balkan pigs / 124
2 / Pazardzhik / 18 Aug 2021 / Industrial / 11 187
3 / Plovdiv / 19 Aug 2021 / Backyard / 5
4 / Pazardzhik / 20 Aug 2021 / Family/ 40
5 / Plovdiv / 23 Sep 2021 / Backyard /1
Total in 2021: 11 356

The wide spread of ASF within Bulgaria's wild boar population, in the said and additional regions, is apparent from the maps in slides 4 and 5.

The village of Zhenda (Jenda) is part of Chernoochene municipality, located in the region Kurdzhali, south-central Bulgaria (map at <tinyurl.com/74v96akf>). It remains to be clarified if this ASF-affected facility is a hunting farm, similar to the other 3 affected facilities, or a captive boar farm/domestic pig farm. - Mod.AS
