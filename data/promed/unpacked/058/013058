A US study of 3506 cancer patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in 2020 shows that Black patients were significantly more likely than their White peers to have severe illness, regardless of demographic and clinical risk factors and cancer type, status, and therapy at COVID-19 diagnosis (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2790424).

A Tufts University researcher led the study, which was published yesterday [28 Mar 2022] in JAMA Network Open, using electronic health records and data from the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium registry from 17 Mar 2020 to 18 Nov 2020. Underlying illnesses such as cancer put COVID-19 patients at higher risk for severe illness and death.

Among all patients, 30% were Black, 50% were women, and median age at COVID-19 diagnosis was 65 years for Black patients and 68 for White patients. Black patients had higher rates of underlying illnesses than White patients, including obesity (45% vs 38%), diabetes (38% vs 24%), and kidney disease (23% vs 16%). Most patients had solid tumors, 20% of which were breast cancer.

Black patients were more likely than their White peers to have moderate (41% vs 34%) or severe (15% vs 11%) COVID-19 at diagnosis (unweighted odds ratio [OR], 1.34; weighted OR, 1.21). Lung conditions were the most common COVID-19 complication (37% overall), with higher rates among Black, relative to White, patients (42% vs 35%).

Likewise, Black patients had higher rates of acute kidney injury (27% vs 15%) and cardiovascular complications (26% vs 22%) than their White peers. Black patients were less likely than White patients to receive the antiviral drug remdesivir (6% vs 10%) and more likely to receive the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine (24% vs 15%), which has been disproven as a treatment for COVID-19.

Compared with White patients, Black patients had higher rates of hospitalization (65% vs 55%), intensive care unit admission (23% vs 16%), mechanical ventilation (17% vs 10%), and death from any cause (19% vs 17%). Among the 618 patients who died during follow-up, 82% died within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis, with a 30-day mortality rate of 17% among Black patients and 13% among their White counterparts.

The study authors noted that racial minorities, especially those who are Black, have had higher rates of COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, and death than their White counterparts. While Black Americans make up 13% of the US population, they make up 20% of COVID-19 cases and 23% of related deaths. Even before the pandemic, Black cancer patients had the highest death rates of all racial groups, the researchers said.

"These findings suggest that, within the framework of structural racism in the United States, having cancer and COVID-19 is associated with worse outcomes among Black patients compared with White patients," they wrote. "Unfortunately, if these same racial inequities in access to medical care hold for cancer screening, in the near future, we are likely to see worsening disparities in rates of advanced stage cancers at diagnosis."

The team defined structural racism as the ways in which societies reinforce discriminatory distribution of resources and attitudes among systems of healthcare, law enforcement, education, employment, benefits, media, and housing.

Racial health disparities are largely a social construct caused by discrimination, senior author Dimpy Shah, MD, PhD, said in a University of Texas at San Antonio news release (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/947894). "Some of the societal root causes of health disparities, including lack of access to health care, social determinants of health, preexisting comorbidities and access to clinical research, are common to both cancer and COVID-19, and together these 2 diseases create a perfect storm," she said.

The researchers urged more work addressing the cumulative and synergistic association of racial inequities on clinical outcomes. "This is a call for action to eradicate root causes of racial inequities, within the causal framework of structural racism, to reduce the disproportionate burden of diseases, such as COVID-19 and cancer, among Black patients and, possibly, other minority racial and ethnic groups," they concluded.

"...The inequity in access to quality health care that can lead to worse baseline clinical factors and ultimately severe complications among racial and ethnic minority groups is well known (6). Our findings are similar to the patterns of racial disparities observed among patients with cancer, which points to an overlap in the root causes of racial inequities between cancer and COVID-19. In addition, racial and ethnic minority groups are more likely to live in conditions that pose a challenge to social distancing and also are more likely to be essential workers; therefore, sheltering in place may not be a possibility for many of them, thus putting these populations at an increased risk for exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (6,39). These and additional sociodemographic pressures such as underinsurance may lead to delays in seeking medical care, which would likely be associated with more severe COVID-19 upon presentation.

"Unfortunately, if these same racial inequities in access to medical care hold for cancer screening, in the near future, we are likely to see worsening disparities in rates of advanced stage cancers at diagnosis (6). The COVID-19 pandemic has been especially challenging for the treatment of patients with cancer (40). In our study, the racial disparities in COVID-19 severity were sustained for patients receiving active cancer therapy (Table 3). In addition, there are a host of drug interactions between chemotherapeutic agents and COVID-19 therapies, leading to alterations in standard treatments. For patients receiving radiation, the pandemic has caused delays between radiotherapy sessions, possibly leading to a reduction in therapeutic efficacy (41). Finally, current and other studies (23,42,43) have demonstrated that Black patients with COVID-19 are less likely to receive novel anti-COVID-19 therapies (e.g., remdesivir) compared with their White counterparts. Our findings that Black patients with cancer and COVID-19 were less likely to receive remdesivir, despite presenting with worse disease, may reflect a persistent gap in healthcare access and equity for Black patients. Unequal access and mistrust of the medical profession among vulnerable populations has resulted in lower rates of vaccine trial enrollment (44) and COVID-19 vaccinations received in the Black community (45), all of which will further exacerbate racial disparities unless urgent remedial actions are undertaken."

[2] Long COVID
Date: Tue 29 Mar 2022

Results of a new survey of 436 Americans with long COVID reveal that the condition is significantly associated with poorer long-term health status, worse quality of life, and psychological distress. The results were published yesterday [28 Mar 2022] in Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/irv.12980).

The study was based on outcomes seen in patients with acute COVID-19 from 1 Apr 2020 to 28 Jul 2020. Among survey participants, 44% had persistent COVID-19 symptoms at long-term follow-up (6-11 months), and 56% had no persistent symptoms.

Even patients with mild presenting illness reported a cluster of symptoms up to 6 months after diagnosis, including fatigue (31%), shortness of breath (20%), difficulty with concentration (9%), and loss of smell (9%).

Of 221 participants who did not have persistent symptoms (were recovered) at long-term follow-up, 122 (55%) had recovered in under 1 month, 74 (33%) recovered in 1-3 months, 20 (9%) had recovered in 3-6 months, and 5 (2%) had recovered after 6 months, the authors said.

Though numerous previous studies have shown that up to 80% of patients with severe COVID (requiring hospitalization) develop long COVID, this study adds to a growing body of literature that suggests that even mild cases have the potential to turn into long COVID.

"We observed that 32% of our outpatient cohort still had not returned to their pre-illness concentration status 6-11 months after acute illness," the authors wrote. "People who are treated as outpatients for mild COVID-19, but have a high burden of persistent symptoms, may benefit from access to the Post-COVID Recovery Clinics that have been developed for inpatients and ICU survivors."

Conclusions
-----------
"Among a group of patients with mild COVID-19 not requiring hospitalization who participated in this cohort study, almost half had persistent symptoms after 6-11 months. Although long-term morbidity rates reported here were lower than those in cohorts of hospitalized patients, persistent symptoms were significantly associated with poorer long-term health status, poorer quality of life, and psychological distress. Medical practitioners should be aware of the potential for long-term symptoms even among mild COVID-19 cases and provide treatment options (e.g., specialized care) to patients accordingly."]

[3] China: lockdown
Date: Mon 28 Mar 2022

China began a COVID-19 lockdown Monday [28 Mar 2022] to temper a growing outbreak in Shanghai -- its financial capital and most populous city -- marking the largest coronavirus lockdown China has seen since early 2020.

The 2-phase process started in Shanghai's Pudong financial district neighboring areas, which will be closed Monday through Friday [28 Mar-1 Apr 2022] while the local government conducts mass testing. The downtown area west of the Huangpu River will begin the 2nd phase with its own 5-day lockdown starting Friday [1 Apr 2022].

Shanghai's 26 million residents will be required to stay at home, with deliveries left at checkpoints. Public transportation will stop running, and all businesses -- unless deemed essential -- will shutter.

China has employed an aggressive "zero-COVID" strategy, which involves doubling down with tools like contact tracing, mass testing and lockdowns to get COVID-19 numbers down to zero. This differs significantly from the "living with COVID-19" strategy used by many other nations, which assumes the virus will remain active, just at lower levels. As of the beginning of this week, that method had been effective -- the country had reported fewer than 12 000 deaths from the virus.

China's last major lockdown occurred in Wuhan, where the virus was first detected in late 2019. Its 11 million residents were quarantined in their homes for 76 days.

[4] USA: 2nd booster
[A] Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval
Date: Tue 29 Mar 2022
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/03/fda-oks-second-covid-booster-shot-older-americans


Today [29 Mar 2022] the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized a 2nd booster shot for Americans over 50 and for those 12 years and older who are immunocompromised. "Current evidence suggests some waning of protection over time against serious outcomes from COVID-19 in older and immunocompromised individuals. Based on an analysis of emerging data, a 2nd booster dose of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine could help increase protection levels for these higher-risk individuals," said Peter Marks, MD, PhD, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, in a press release (https://bit.ly/3Ka7xY9).

The authorization is for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines only, and both shots should be administered at least 4 months after the 1st booster dose.

The CDC COVID Data Tracker shows that 65.5% of Americans are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, 76.9% have received at least one dose of vaccine, and 44.8% of fully vaccinated Americans have received a booster dose (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-people-onedose-pop-5yr).

It's unclear if the omicron BA.2 subvariant now dominant in the United Kingdom -- will cause a surge in new COVID-19 cases in the United States, but some experts believe Americans most at risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes should get a booster. BA.2 now makes up more than half of sequenced samples in the United States, or 55%, up from 35% last week.

Following the FDA's announcement, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said it also now recommends that immunocompromised Americans and older adults get a 2nd booster dose. The agency also encouraged adults who had received 1 or 2 Johnson & Johnson (J&J) doses to get an mRNA booster, as well.

"Today, CDC expanded eligibility for an additional booster dose for certain individuals who may be at higher risk of severe outcomes from COVID-19," CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, MD, MPH, said in a statement sent to the media. "CDC, in collaboration with FDA and our public health partners, will continue to evaluate the need for additional booster doses for all Americans."

Supporting the announcement was evidence published today [29 Mar 2022] in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, which shows that adults first vaccinated with the J&J vaccine get better long-term protection with an mRNA booster (http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7113e2).

The VISION Network study determined real-world vaccine efficacy (VE) of one J&J vaccine and 2 alternative booster dose strategies: another J&J shot, or one mRNA booster dose. The study examined 80 287 emergency department/urgent care (ED/UC) visits, and 25 244 hospitalizations across 10 states during 16 Dec 2021 through 7 Mar 2022, which included the omicron surge.

The VE against COVID-19-associated ED/UC visits was 24% after one J&J dose, 54% after 2 J&J doses, and 79% after one J&J/one mRNA dose, compared with 83% after 3 mRNA doses, the authors said. VE for the same strategies against COVID-19-associated hospitalization was 31%, 67%, 78%, and 90%, respectively.

"These findings underscore the importance of receiving recommended COVID-19 booster doses, when eligible, to prevent moderate to severe COVID-19 during omicron variant predominance. All adults who have received mRNA vaccines for their COVID-19 primary series vaccination should receive an mRNA booster dose when they are eligible," the authors said.

Deaths from COVID-19 in the United States are now at their lowest rates since last August [2021], with fewer than 800 deaths per day recorded. Average daily new cases have held at 30 000 per day, and hospitalizations stand at roughly 18 000 per day. The United States reported 42 967 new COVID cases yesterday [28 Mar 2022], plus 985 deaths, per the Johns Hopkins tracker (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/cumulative-cases).

In China, Shanghai's 2-tiered lockdown entered its 2nd day, as mass testing continues to turn up hundreds of asymptomatic infections. Of 6886 local cases reported from China today [29 Mar 2022], 5658 were asymptomatic, about 77% of which were from Shanghai.

Businesses in Shanghai, one of the country's financial and manufacturing hubs, are scrambling to adapt to the lockdown requirements, such as General Motors, which is reportedly keeping production going by having employees sleep on factory floors, according to Reuters (https://reut.rs/36Af1Ff). In other instances, companies are keeping operations going by using a "bubble" approach, similar to the closed-loop method used during the Beijing Winter Olympics.

Elsewhere in China, most symptomatic cases continue to be reported from major cities in Jilin Province, where officials in the capital city Changchun apologized to citizens for pandemic-related food shortages, according to Reuters (https://reut.rs/3NKs9s6).

In other recent Asian hot spots, which experienced later omicron surges, cases declined, such as Hong Kong, where daily cases were at their lowest in 5 weeks with 7596 new cases reported today [29 Mar 2022]. However, in South Korea, after a 5-day decline in cases, the daily total was up again, with 347 374 new cases today, with health officials noting that patterns may be unpredictable owing to the more transmissible BA.2 subvariant, which became the country's dominant strain last week, according to The Korea Herald (https://bit.ly/3uImIkI).

FDA's authorization of a 2nd COVID-19 booster shot for individuals 50 and over provides another opportunity for people to increase their level of protection against severe disease, hospitalization and death.

IDSA calls on Congress to pass another COVID-19 supplemental funding bill to ensure that all individuals can access COVID-19 vaccines, including newly authorized boosters, as well as COVID-19 tests and therapeutics. The bill should also include the resources necessary for global COVID-19 vaccination and response in order to prevent the development and spread of new variants.

Vaccination remains a critical tool to end the pandemic, and IDSA strongly encourages all individuals to stay up to date on their vaccinations.
