Health officials in Guinea are racing to contain a new outbreak of Ebola that has killed at least 4 people and raised concerns across west Africa, which previously suffered the worst from the virus.

On Mon 15 Feb 2021 morning, a 4th victim died in Guinea, and 4 others are being treated in an isolation centre, suffering vomiting, diarrhoea and bleeding. At least 7 of the people who contracted the virus attended the funeral of a nurse in Goueke, a town near the Liberian border, on 1 Feb 2021 the government said on Sun [14 Feb 2021].

"All measures are being taken to stem this epidemic as soon as possible," Guinea's health ministry said, declaring an outbreak of the virus last seen in the region in 2016 at the end of a traumatic 3-year outbreak, which infected more than 28 000 people and caused 11 000 deaths in west Africa.

The epidemic spread from Guinea to Liberia, Sierra Leone and other countries in the region, sparking extensive and vital prevention, treatment and surveillance systems in several countries, which health officials said had been immediately alerted to contain the outbreak in Guinea. An intensive test-and-trace campaign has begun in Goueke and neighbouring towns.

Vaccinations and treatments that have been developed in recent years were being quickly deployed to Guinea and were on standby in neighbouring Liberia and other west African countries, the World Health Organization said, adding to hope that an outbreak could be contained.

"There is real concern and a challenge to maintain and reinforce Guinea's health systems," said Georges Ki-Zerbo, the head of the WHO mission in Guinea, "but also there is a lot of reinforcement taking place and regional cooperation. On the ground, there are dozens of respondents already mobilised."

The spectre of an Ebola outbreak emerging as countries battled with Covid-19 was also an acute concern, Ki-Zerbo said, as resources were stretched. In some places the response to the pandemic was also a strength. "The alert and vigilance brought by Covid should also help with Ebola, which is easier to detect," he said.

Yet an Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), while the country battles to contain coronavirus cases as conflict intensifies, has caused alarm. Four cases of Ebola have been detected, with efforts to address the outbreak hamstrung by conflict between armed groups. Kate Moger, a regional official at the International Rescue Committee, said the Ebola cases were a disaster for communities in northern DRC. "They have faced decades of violence by armed groups and have now, between Ebola and Covid-19, been faced with disease outbreaks for almost 3 straight years."

Following the cases in Guinea, health officials in west Africa expressed a mixture of growing concern but also some confidence that a major outbreak could be averted. Significant progress had been achieved in improving the capabilities of health systems in small, low-income countries like Guinea in west Africa to deal with virus outbreaks such as Ebola, Lassa fever, yellow fever and most recently Covid-19, Ki-Zerbo said.

On Sun 14 Feb 2021, Liberia, which shares a porous border with Guinea, announced its health systems would be on alert for potential cases.

Heounohu Romello Hessou, a doctor and senior official in the country's Covid-19 response, worked in Liberia during its Ebola outbreak and said measures had rapidly begun since the 1st cases were announced in Guinea and an intensive test-and-trace system was under way in nearby Liberian border towns.

"Right now, the entire public health institute, essentially birthed from the Ebola outbreak, are working around the clock, sending fact-finding teams, putting out public health measures in those towns bordering Guinea," he said.

"Ring vaccinations" were being implemented, where vaccines to prevent and treat Ebola would be administered to all known contacts of those infected, he said, with the capacity for widespread testing available.

- December: 1st case
Date: Mon 15 Feb 2021
Source: Guinee Matin [abridged, edited]
https://guineematin.com/2021/02/15/reapparition-du-virus-ebola-en-guinee-le-cas-a-commence-en-debut-decembre-2020-a-nzerekore-drs/


As previously announced, Ebola haemorrhagic disease has reappeared in Guinea. Already, it has killed at least 3 people in the southern region of the country where the 1st cases have been recorded, especially in the sub-prefecture of Gouecke, prefecture of N'Zerekore.

The resurgence of this disease in this region led the administrative and health authorities of N'Zerekore to hold yesterday, Sun 14 Feb2021, a "health emergency meeting" which resulted in the implementation of a response plan. And, at the end of this meeting, Dr H Sira Guilavogui, in charge of training, planning and research at the regional health directorate of N'Zerekore, revealed that the reappearance of the Ebola virus dates back to the very beginning of December 2020, reports the correspondent of https://Guineematin.com in the capital of the forest region.

According to the training, planning and research officer at the N'Zerekore regional health directorate, the causes of the resurgence of the Ebola virus in Guinea are not yet known. However, Dr H Sira Guilavogui specifies that it was at the beginning of last December [2020] that the previously known zero patient (a 51-year-old nurse) presented to the Gouecke health center with vomiting and diarrhea. The diagnosis which had been made to him had then concluded to a severe anemia.

"On 12 Feb 2021, we were informed by the director of the hospital of the arrival of some suspicious cases; and, immediately, the DPS and the DRS, went to the bedside of these patients. Samples were taken and sent to Gouecke and Conakry for analysis. But the investigation team continued to Gouecke where the suspected cases resided. In the field, during the investigation, we also noted another case which was sick in the family. He was transferred to the hospital. But, as of today, we have 2 cases who are hospitalized at the CT-EPI in N'Zerekore. A case that was referred to Conakry and 2 cases that died and whose bodies are in the N'Zerekore morgue, are awaiting a dignified and secure burial.

This is because the case began in early December 2020 when the old woman (51-year-old nurse) presented to the Gouecke health center. But, the diagnosis that was made was a diagnosis of severe anemia. She was hospitalized for 5 days at the health center and was released. And, a few days later, she passed away. In the meantime, her sister-in-law who looked after her during her convalescence also developed the same approximate signs as the old woman. And, over time, she, too, passed away. This is how the other members of the family (brothers and sisters) also saw themselves in the same picture," explained Dr HSira Guilavogui.

To contain this disease and prevent its spread throughout the N'Zerekore prefecture, "urgent measures" have just been taken by the local authorities. And, among these provisions, there is in particular the establishment of a "belt of struggle" to identify, locate and isolate all contacts in Gouecke.

"Urgent arrangements have been made; and, within the framework of the application of these provisions, we met this morning so that all the points which were found or omitted are re-established, that each one is operational on the ground. That is why we held this meeting so that already at the level of Gouecke, we constitute a form of belt for the fight against this disease by seeking all contacts. The suspected cases, the confirmed cases that all these contacts are revealed and that they are located somewhere to prevent them from spreading the disease. I would like to ask the population not to panic, to play the games of the services of health and games for all those who are concerned by the fight against this disease to prevent it from spreading throughout the country," said Saa Yola Tolno.

[It would be helpful if rapid Ebola tests were available in countries where the virus is enzootic. Then when a case presents at a clinic with suspicious symptoms even remotely similar to Ebola, a rapid test could be performed, and the patient isolated to prevent further spread.

WHO assessed and listed the "ReEBOV Antigen Rapid Test Kit (Corgenix, USA) as eligible for procurement to Ebola affected countries. The test was evaluated under WHO's Emergency Assessment and Use, a procedure established to provide minimum quality, safety and performance assurance for diagnostic products in the context of the Ebola emergency.

Ebola is [generally] tested in laboratories largely through the detection of the virus's nucleic acid using commercial or in-house tests. Nucleic acid tests (NATs) are more accurate but are complex to use and require well-established laboratories and fully trained personnel. In addition, turn-around time can vary between 12 and 24 hours.

The ReEBOV Antigen Rapid Test, which can provide results within 15 minutes, is based on detection of the Ebola protein rather than nucleic acid. When compared with the results of a NAT previously listed by WHO and currently being used in the field (RealStar Filovirus Screen RT-PCR Kit 1.0, altona Diagnostics GmbH), ReEBOV Antigen Rapid Test is able to correctly identify about 92% of Ebola infected patients and 85% of those not infected with the virus.

While less accurate, the antigen test is rapid, easy to perform and does not require electricity - it can therefore be used at lower health care facilities or in mobile units for patients in remote settings. Where possible, results from ReEBOV antigen Rapid Test Kit should be confirmed by testing a new blood sample using an approved Ebola NAT."

- Sierra Leone: activation of emergency response
Date: Sun 14 Feb 2021
Source: The Sierra Leone Telegraph [abridged, edited]
https://www.thesierraleonetelegraph.com/sierra-leone-activates-ebola-emergency-response-after-4-dead-in-guinea/?shared=email&msg=fail


Following confirmation yesterday [13 Feb 2021] by the Guinean Health Ministry that 4 people had died of Ebola at a hospital in the Guinean Sierra Leone border town of Guerkedou, near the town of Yenga in eastern Sierra Leone, the government of Sierra Leone says it is taking no chances.

President Julius Maada Bio ordered Ministry of Health officials "to inform the general public that even though there are no reported cases of EVD in Sierra Leone, the government will take prudent action to prevent any introduction of the virus into the country and institute measures to protect the lives of Sierra Leoneans."

The government of Sierra Leone also said in a statement that:
"The government of Sierra Leone has activated its Health Emergency Response System to level II (Enhanced Surveillance, Active Case Finding and robust Community Engagement).

The Ministry of Health and Sanitation wishes to assure the general public that we will build on our expertise and experience to mount a solid response that not only prevents the reintroduction of Ebola into the country, but should the virus be introduced, have a strong system that protects the lives of all Sierra Leoneans and interrupts the transmission of the virus.

With the border with the Republic of Guinea currently closed, Health Authorities and local stakeholders in the districts bordering Guinea and Sierra Leone have been supported to heighten Ebola surveillance, and improve community awareness, including appropriate preparedness measures.

National Rapid Response Teams are being dispatched to provide additional support to the District Health Management Teams. We intend to work very closely with our Guinean counterparts to quickly contain the situation.

The Ministry of Health and Sanitation wishes to encourage the general public to be vigilant and report all suspected cases and deaths through the 117 toll-free hotline or to their local authorities. The Government of Sierra Leone intends to collaborate very closely with all our local, regional, and international partners especially partners of the Mano River Union."

- ECDC (European Center for Disease Control): epidemiological update
Date: Mon 15 Feb 2021

On 14 Feb 2021, an Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak was declared in the rural area of Gouecke in N'Zerekore region, Guinea, by national health authorities. Three laboratory-confirmed cases have been confirmed by the national reference laboratory, the 1st confirmed cases reported since 2016.

According to the World Health Organization's Regional Office for Africa and the Ministry of Health of Guinea, on 28 Jan 2021, a healthcare worker from Gouecke Health Center died. Six people who attended his funeral on 1 Feb 2021 later began to show Ebola-like symptoms (diarrhoea, vomiting and bleeding). Two of these cases have since died, and the other 4 have been hospitalised.

According to Agence Nationale de Securite Sanitaire-ANSS, one of the 4 hospitalised cases is currently in isolation at a healthcare facility in Conakry, while the other 3 have been isolated in Gouecke, N'Zerekore region.

Samples from the confirmed cases have been sent to the Institut Pasteur in Senegal for full genome sequencing in order to identify the strain of the Ebola virus.

Response measures have been initiated and the World Health Organization (WHO) is supporting Guinea in procuring the EVD vaccine. As the outbreak is located in a border area, WHO is also liaising with health authorities from Liberia and Sierra Leone to enhance surveillance activities in their districts bordering Guinea, as well as strengthening their testing capacity and conducting surveillance at health facilities. WHO is also in contact with Cote d'Ivoire, Mali, Senegal and other countries at risk in the sub-region. According to media sources, Sierra Leone has upgraded its health emergency response plan and the border with Guinea has been closed.

There is a risk that cases may flare up in Guinea. The information currently available is insufficient to be able to confidently assess the likelihood of further or more widespread transmission. Continuing response measures and follow-up of survivors are essential to detect and interrupt transmission early on. Response measures may be jeopardised by other outbreaks in the country.

Significant developments have been made in the prevention of Ebola virus disease, with 2 vaccines now licensed for use in several countries. Assuming that healthcare workers (including EU/EEA citizens that could be deployed in response to this outbreak) are vaccinated and adhere to recommended precautionary measures, the risk of them becoming infected is low.

For other EU/EEA citizens living in or travelling through Guinea, the likelihood of exposure is very low, as is the likelihood of introduction and further spread of the Ebola virus within the EU/EEA.

[The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Burundi, Ghana and Zambia have licensed the Ebola vaccine Ervebo. The injectable Ebola vaccine is manufactured by Merck (known as MSD outside the US and Canada.

The Ebola virus (Zaire ebolavirus) vaccine is a replication-competent, live, attenuated recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) vaccine. It is also known as V920, rVSVIG-ZEBOV-GP or rVSV-ZEBOV; brand name ERVEBOÂ and manufactured by Merck. It contains a gene for the EBOV glycoprotein that replaces the gene for the native VSV glycoprotein.

Preliminary study results have shown a 97.5% vaccine efficacy. Data also suggests that vaccinating people who are already infected reduces their chances of dying.

The vaccine was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 19 Dec 2019 for the prevention of EVD caused by EBOV in people 18 years of age and older, based on the data from 12 clinical trials that included a total of 15 399 adults (WHO and CDC).

"In the event of an outbreak in the near future, doses of rVSV delta G-ZEBOV-GP would be available from different sources. Researchers in West Africa have a few thousand doses left from the trials, currently stored under Good Clinical Practices conditions. The manufacturer reported that there are a few thousand doses in stock that are owned by the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority. In addition, the manufacturer committed to produce 300 000 doses for GAVI Alliance through an Advance Procurement Commitment (APC)."

During an interview granted Sat 13 Feb 2021 to Radio Okapi, the provincial minister of health, Dr Nzanzu Salita affirmed that the vaccine has already started in the health zone of Biena, without specifying the day of its start. He also indicated that this vaccine could spread to other health zones shortly.

Among the other actions already carried out, the Provincial Minister of Health cites, among others, the disinfection of homes and health structures frequented by patients:

"The actions that have already been carried out, the households have been decontaminated, the healthcare structures, in particular the health center of Masoya, decontaminated; we have already listed the contacts, and our teams are hard at work to be able to carry out other actions with the community so that it understands that, here we are, we still have a threat and that we all must unite, work hand in hand to contain this epidemic as quickly as possible."

In addition, the Minister also speaks of an Ebola treatment center set up and where the 22-year-old patient is currently isolated. He adds that 260 contacts for all 3 registered cases are being followed up for 21 days and the listing continues.

Within the community, he admits, some inhabitants of Butembo are still skeptical about this new wave of Ebola, others on the other hand say they understand the danger:

"It's a disappointment really because we thought that Ebola was already over, and here we are again, Ebola is coming back, now that corona is already there too, so I don't know how we are going to deal with all this."

For his part, the Mayor of the city of Butembo Sylvain Kanyamanda indicates that meetings are multiplying with all the partners to make the necessary arrangements to quickly control this disease.

A week after the declaration of the new wave of Ebola virus disease in the Butembo-Lubero region, 3 cases have already been notified including 2 deaths and a patient currently being treated in Butembo. In addition, more than 200 contact cases are being followed up, reports the Provincial Minister of Health.

[While not stated, I assume the vaccine is the Ervebo, but I welcome correction if the adenovirus recombinant vaccine is also being used. The latter is Ad26.ZEBOV vector (based on the AdVac platform developed by Crucell Holland B.V., a company acquired by Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson) with a modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA)-vectored vaccine (MVA-BN Filo, developed by Bavarian Nordic).] - Mod.LK

The humanitarian coordinator in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, David McLachlan-Karr, is worried about the resurgence of the Ebola epidemic in the Lubero territory in North Kivu. In a statement released Fri 11 Feb 2021, he said he encouraged the commitment of the humanitarian community to support the Congolese authorities and the populations of the affected areas.

"I express my full support and confidence to the Congolese authorities and urge them to take swift and decisive action to protect all contact persons in order to prevent the spread of the virus," said Mr. McLachlan-Karr.

In support of the authorities, the World Health Organization (WHO) and other partners have mobilized to launch the 1st response actions in the health zones concerned.

Currently, nearly 10 000 doses of vaccine are available in the country and some are on their way to the town of Butembo, writes McLachlan-Karr.

"The Democratic Republic of the Congo has health professionals experienced in the fight against Ebola virus disease. As we had done during previous epidemics, we promise to quickly mobilize partners to support the Government's efforts," said McLachlan-Karr.

For him, the priority is now to ensure good coordination of operational partners in the field for the tracing of contact cases and their vaccination as well as the management of suspected cases.

The fight against the 10th epidemic outbreak, the deadliest to date in the DRC, lasted almost 2 and a half years and claimed nearly 2300 lives in eastern DRC.

An 11th Ebola outbreak killed 55 people in Equateur province between June and November 2020.

"Humanitarian organizations have learned lessons from the last 2 outbreaks of the Ebola epidemic. It is on the basis of this experience that we are monitoring the situation, implementing measures to protect the communities concerned and front-line workers, but also to avoid any abuses that may have tainted and hampered the work of humanitarian workers during the previous response in eastern DRC," said McLachlan-Karr.
