There have been a number of misleading, and often wrong, statements
published by the media over the last few days, so I thought I'd put
together a summary of what's happened so far, with the kakapo, from our
point of view at the Institute of Veterinary Animal and Biomedical
Sciences, Massey University.
History of the birds: The Department of Conservation (DOC) trans-located 18
young birds from Codfish Island to Chalky Island on the 8 Jul 2004. They
did pre-translocation health screening, which excluded one bird from the
transfer because of an ulcerative cloacitis, but all of the others had
healthy physical exams, CBCs [complete blood counts], and fecal cultures.
The birds were shifted in 2 batches. They were kept in clean transport
cages during the translocation, and, did not come in physical contact with
each other. Nor were they placed in pens together.
Immediately after translocation, 5 birds were noted to not be moving around
as much as would normally be expected. All birds were monitored using
radio-transmitters. Because of this high degree of post-translocation
monitoring, the DOC was very quick to pick up the 1st mortality, which
occurred 3-4 days after transport. A 2nd bird, from the 2nd batch
trans-located, died 3 days after its transfer, and a 3rd bird died 5 days
after transport. The other 2 birds, who were noted to be slow in moving,
improved during this period, and, seemed to be moving around much more
strongly.
Postmortem findings: Gross necropsy changes were similar in all 3 birds.
The main findings in each bird were of congested, mottled liver and spleen,
and, a variable degree of enteritis. All birds were in good body condition,
with good fat reserves, and food still present in the crop. The gross
findings were suggestive of a bacterial septicemia.
Cytology (performed by New Zealand Veterinary Pathology): Impression smears
of liver: the smears were of high cellularity with many lysed hepatocytes
in a background of blood. Amongst these were low numbers of inflammatory
cells, mainly macrophages, with a few heterophils and small lymphocytes,
and, very occasional eosinophils. There were large numbers of bacterial
rods present in the background of the smears, but, also, heterophils and
macrophages with the same bacteria in their cytoplasm.
Impression smears of spleen: The smears were of high cellularity, but the
cells were degenerating. Most appeared to be small lymphocytes, with
occasional large lymphoblasts, reactive lymphocytes, and macrophages. Very
occasional heterophils and eosinophils were present. In a significant
number of macrophages, the cytoplasm was full of rod-shaped bacteria.
Lesser numbers were present in the background.
Heart blood smears: Estimated white cell count ca.10 x 10 9/L. The majority
of cells were monocytes with lower numbers of reactive lymphocytes.
Heterophils were very rare. Red cells and thrombocytes appeared normal.
There were rod-shaped bacteria in the background, and in the cytoplasm, of
some monocytes.
Comment: In the spleen and liver, there was evidence of a bacterial
infection with the rod-shaped organisms present in both heterophils and
macrophages. There has, presumably, been some PM [post mortem] growth,
given the bacteria in the background, but a significant number are within
cells, suggesting this is a real change. This fits with the findings in the
blood, where cell counts were low normal, but, there is a profound
heteropenia consistent with peracute bacterial infection.
Bacteriology (performed by Hamish Mack): _E. coli_ was isolated from kidney
and spleen, and was likely to be a post-mortem invader.
Small, grey bacterial colonies were isolated on blood agar plates from
liver, kidney, and spleen. These consisted of variably Gram-staining
bacilli. These have been confirmed by biochemical testing as the bacterial
species _Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae_. Antibiotic sensitivity testing is
still in process, but the organisms are resistant to penicillin (which is
unusual for _E. rhusiopathiae_), but, sensitive to amoxycillin/clavulanic
acid combinations.
Histopathology (performed by Maurice Alley): The liver was diffusely
congested and contained irregular focal infiltrations of lymphocytes, and
plasma cells, around many blood vessels. The cytoplasm of the majority of
Kupffer cells throughout the liver was distended, with large,
Gram-positive, pleomorphic bacterial rods resembling Erysipelothrix.
Similar organisms were also present in the cytoplasm of some endothelial cells.
The spleen showed diffuse lymphoid hyperlasia and contains numerous clumps
of large histiocytes filled with similar Gram-positive organisms.
The lung shows a mild generalized increase in numbers of circulating
mononuclear cells. Many alveolar endothelial cells were laden with
Gram-positive bacteria.
The kidney showed a moderate early interstitial nephritis, with
periglomerular mononuclear cell infiltration, and bacterial accumulations
in many endothelial cells. A few endothelial cells in the heart,
proventriculus, and small intestine contained similar bacteria.
Diagnosis: Bacterial septicemia due to _Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae_.
Note: The disease caused by _Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae_ in domestic and
wild animals is called erysipelas. However, in people, erysipelas is a skin
disease caused by certain species of _Streptococcus bacteria_. In humans,
disease caused by bacterial infection with _Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae_
is called erysipeloid.
Background on Erysipelas in domestic and wild animals:
* In birds, is generally an acute fulminating infection
* Many different vertebrate species are affected worldwide, and outbreaks
occur rarely, but in a wide range, of species and locations
* Most common in turkeys and pigs, but seen in a range of terrestrial and
seabirds including penguins. Found in the slime on fish scales
* It is pathogenic for any age and sex, following exposure by parenteral,
or oral, routes
* The mechanism of disease is not well understood, but neuraminidase
production correlates best with virulence
* It can survive in soil for 35 days under a variety of conditions
* Carrier animals can exist
* Experimentally, the incubation period can range from 44 hrs to several weeks
* Experimentally, in poultry, the clinical signs are acute deaths, droopy
birds, and diarrhea. Gradual emaciation, anemia, and weakness occur in
cases with endocarditis
* It decreases egg production, and, may cause male infertility in chronic
infections in poultry
Background on zoonotic disease in humans: In people, infection with
_Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae_ (known as erysipeloid) is generally
characterized by a local infection, but, can occasionally be manifest as
septicemic disease, which may be fatal. Infections are generally via a cut
in the skin and are common in fish handlers, butchers, kitchen workers,
vets, and turkey growers.
As the pathologist doing the dissection, I suffered a penetrating wound to
my thumb at some point in the procedure, of which, I was unaware. About 24
hours later, there was a slight reddening (flare) around the wound, and 48
hrs later, I had a 2 cm diameter raised lesion around the wound, which was
hot and painful, but there was no discharge. This is likely to be an
erysipeloid lesion, and, is responding to amoxycillin/clavulanic acid
antibiotic treatment.
Treatment Options: The management of the birds is in the hands of the
Kakapo Recovery team. However, in an outbreak in poultry, it is recommended
to treat all in-contact birds for 5 days with antibiotics, and, give all
birds a dose of an inactivated commercial bacterin vaccine, which is
readily available. Side effects of vaccination are rare. The difficulties
of treatment are that kakapo are solitary birds that need to be penned
separately. At this stage, both the vaccine and antibiotics are being given
to the trans-located group of birds.
Source of the infection: The source at this stage remains unknown, and we
may never know for sure. The most likely possibility is that this infection
was present in wildlife reservoirs of seabirds, or terrestrial birds that
visit the island, and that the kakapo have been infected orally while
grazing. The organism will survive in soil, but, only for comparatively
short periods.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. Gartrell for his thorough account of
the incident regarding the birds, the pathology, and his own unfortunate
accident.
The case certainly serves as a reminder that accidents can, and do, happen
during necropsies, even when care and caution are being exercised.
Undoubtedly, Dr. Gartrell would have changed gloves had he realized there
was a break in this measure of his personal protective equipment. Â­ Mod.TG]
