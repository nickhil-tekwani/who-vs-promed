Orange rust of sugarcane, _Puccinia kuehnii_,
detected in Palm Beach County, FL ï¿½ USA
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
On 17 Jul 2007, USDA's [US Department of
Agriculture] Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service (APHIS) confirmed the detection of orange
rust of sugarcane, _Puccinia kuehnii_ (W. Kruger)
E.J. Butler, in commercial sugarcane fields in
Palm Beach County, FL. APHIS and the Florida
Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services
(FDACS) are conducting surveys to delimit the distribution of the disease.
This particular rust has not previously been found in the Western Hemisphere.
APHIS has established a technical working group
of experts to discuss survey and control
strategies in response to the orange rust
detection. The group will continue to meet on a
regular basis to address this developing
situation and consider mitigation strategies.
The initial symptoms of orange rust are minute,
elongated yellow lesions which take on a pale
yellow-green halo as they increase in size. As
the lesions grow, an orange to orange-brown color
develops. Unlike common brown rust, orange rust
lesions are never dark brown. Pustules of orange
rust tend to occur in groups on the affected leaf
surface with most pustules on the lower surface
and more lesions toward the leaf base. Wind and
large air masses can rapidly spread the pathogen.
Also unlike common brown rust, which is more
prevalent during the spring, environmental
conditions conducive for the development of
orange rust include warm, humid summer and cool fall conditions.
This disease has the potential to cause
significant economic losses to the Florida
sugarcane crop. In 2000, orange rust caused
extensive yield losses in susceptible varieties
of sugarcane in Australia. The primary long-term
control strategy for the disease is the planting
of resistant sugarcane varieties.
Under IPPC standards, _Puccinia kuehnii_ is
considered to be a pathogen that is transient,
actionable, and under surveillance in the United States.

[Orange rust has been present in Australia for
more than 100 years but it has rarely caused
significant economic crop loss. An outbreak of
orange rust occurred in Queensland in 1999-2000
which was attributed to the appearance of a new
race of _P. kuehnii_. The most widely grown
commercial cultivar Q124 (accounting for 45
percent of the total crop) was totally devastated
and the industry suffered yield losses of over
Australian dollars 150 million (US dollars 128.74
million). Initially, the disease was controlled
with fungicides because of the lack of sufficient
resistant planting material. New resistant
varieties have since been developed to replace Q124.
Sugarcane brown (common) rust is caused by _P.
melanocephala_ which occurs in the USA, Ecuador,
Colombia, Australia, Mauritius and possibly
elsewhere. Yield loss, depending on environmental
conditions, was estimated to be 10-20 percent in
Australia and 20-40 percent in the USA. Disease
management includes fungicides and the use of
resistant varieties. Rain favours the development
of orange rust but inhibits the development of brown rust.
The Australian orange rust outbreak illustrated
once again that reliance on one cultivar may be
disastrous for any agricultural industry. Strains
with increased virulence of even minor endemic
pathogens may emerge and threaten the existence
of an entire industry. Whether this has occurred
in the USA, or whether the pathogen was
introduced recently as well as a possible source
of this incursion, remains to be clarified. This
discovery is potentially very serious for sugarcane farmers in the Americas.
