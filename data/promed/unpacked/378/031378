[1] Ivermectin misuse

http://www.opb.org/article/2021/09/17/5-oregonians-hospitalized-after-attempting-to-treat-covid-19-with-roundworm-killing-drug/


Five Oregonians have been hospitalized because they misused the deworming drug ivermectin in an attempt to treat or prevent COVID-19, according to the Oregon Poison Center at Oregon Health and Science University.

The patients had symptoms like dizziness, balance issues, changes to blood pressure, and seizures. Two people became so ill they were admitted to intensive care. There is no credible scientific evidence to support the idea that ivermectin has any effect against COVID-19.

All told, the Oregon Poison Center saw 25 patients who became ill because they deliberately misused ivermectin between 1 Aug and 14 Sep [2021]. Because ivermectin requires a prescription in humans, some of the patients had attempted to medicate themselves using an over-the-counter form of the drug.

These hospitalizations came during Oregon's worst COVID-19 surge to date. Since early August [2021], hospitals have been handling an overflow of patients, and some have had to ration care. Hospital administrators and state officials have asked people to avoid unnecessary risks to keep hospital beds available for people who need them.

"COVID-19 is a devastating disease and can be very frightening, but the public does not need to use -- nor should it use -- potentially dangerous drugs to fight it," said Dr. Robert Hendrickson, medical director at the Oregon Poison Center.

Ivermectin has been called a wonder drug, but that doesn't mean it cures all ills. It's really just good at killing one type of thing: the roundworms that infect humans, animals, and plants. Some cause mild stomach problems or skin rashes. Others cause debilitating diseases like river blindness. Diseases caused by roundworms are some of the leading causes of death and disability around the world.

Roundworms are a type of animal called a nematode and can range in size from microscopic to 3 ft [0.9 m] long, though most are on the smaller side. Evolutionarily, that means roundworms are more closely related to humans than they are like viruses, bacteria, or even plants. Ivermectin is extremely good at killing roundworms and related animals: a single dose of ivermectin a year is all it takes to cure river blindness.

Which is why it's so surprising that ivermectin has become the latest unfounded, would-be cure-all for COVID-19. While some medications that treat one thing can later be found to treat another, taking a medication that can kill flies and worms in a single dose, for weeks in a row, is never advised. Especially if that medication is being taken without doctor supervision, using an over-the-counter version intended for horses.

There is overwhelming scientific consensus that ivermectin cannot be used to treat or prevent COVID-19, and the paper that initially popularized the drug as a COVID-19 treatment [https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02081-w] was retracted for plagiarism and falsifying data [https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/jul/16/huge-study-supporting-ivermectin-as-covid-treatment-withdrawn-over-ethical-concerns].

Researchers have been investigating the idea that ivermectin could be used as an antiviral drug for several years. But those tests were done "in vitro" in labs. That means they were conducted in a laboratory using human cells. So far, those results have never been replicated in live animal trials. This is not surprising: most drugs that have an effect in a laboratory don't work in real life. In fact, the majority of drugs that make it past animal trials and progress to human trials end up not working. That's part of why finding new drugs is so difficult.

Because ivermectin is not an effective COVID-19 treatment or preventative, as reports of cases rose, the Food and Drug Administration put out an advisory stating that it should not be prescribed to treat COVID-19. The World Health Organization and other public health agencies around the globe have put out similar statements.

If you or someone you know has become ill after taking ivermectin, contact the Oregon Poison Center at 800-222-1222.

[For prior news coverage of ivermectin misuse and overdosing for COVID, see https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/30/health/covid-ivermectin-prescriptions.html and https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/09/04/1034217306/ivermectin-overdose-exposure-cases-poison-control-centers.

The anthelminthic drug ivermectin targets a glutamate-gated chloride channel that is present only in invertebrates. This target selectivity is a major reason for the drug's excellent activity and safety profile, which has been demonstrated in deworming campaigns involving hundreds of millions of adults and children in regions around the world that are endemic for helminthic infections such as ascariasis, hookworm, filariasis, and onchocerciasis. This safety is obviously based on those doses recommended and tested in humans. However, if ingested at the much higher doses used in ivermectin-containing formulations for large animals -- horses and cattle weigh about 6 to 8 times more than humans -- one can see significant off-target neurotoxic effects, including lethargy, seizures, disorientation, and coma. For scientific reviews of ivermectin toxicity from the pre-COVID era, see https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5929173/ and https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22039794/.

The repurposing of ivermectin for COVID was set off last year [2020] by an in vitro study showing that it inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication, but this effect was only seen at drug concentrations far higher than even the ingestion of cattle-dose ivermectin would be expected to achieve in humans. A Cochrane review published in July 2021 of 14 published random clinical trials totaling more than 1600 patients found no evidence for ivermectin efficacy in COVID (see https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD015017.pub2/full). Shortly after the publication of the Cochrane review, in early August 2021, the TOGETHER trial involving about 1500 human subjects was halted because of lack of efficacy of ivermectin against COVID (see https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-08-11/ivermectin-no-effect-covid).

The current ivermectin drama is a replay of last year's [2020's] at times vicious controversy over the use of hydroxychloroquine (another antiparasitic drug!) in COVID. In American states and regions, it appears that there is an inverse correlation between COVID vaccination rates and the use of ivermectin for self-treatment. One suspects that there is a substantial overlap between those groups of people who refuse to get vaccinated against COVID, and those who are willing to ingest quantities of ivermectin intended for farm animals to prevent the disease. What unites these 2 camps is a willingness to embrace unproven ideas as facts, driven by social media, in the face of scientific evidence to the contrary. The harassment and abuse of scientific researchers from hydroxychloroquine, and now ivermectin, advocates reminds me of a conspiracy theory joke that I read a few days ago, which is meant to be humorous but unfortunately rings true: "Conspiracy Theory Defined: 1. A belief that a consensus of the world's scientific experts missed something they've spent their entire lives researching, that you were able to uncover in 17 minutes due to superior Googling skills. 2. A belief that decades of medical research, committed by people caring for humanity -- are secretly and irredeemably evil -- and have been exposed by random people you've never heard of, making claims with no evidence, on sites with dubious credibility." - Mod.LXL]

[Ivermectin has its place as a treatment of a variety of parasite illnesses both in animals and in people. However, consumption of parasiticide medications prepared for animals, especially animals weighing hundreds of pounds more than human beings, is not recommended, regardless of the preparation, whether oral paste or injectable products for animals. Before the agents are approved for use in animals, there are numerous studies done regarding the efficacy, the dose, and the effects, both positive and negative. There have been no controlled studies of using the animal products in humans. - Mod.TG]

[In the past 24 hours, 9 countries including the USA (86 072), UK (35 702), Turkey (27 688), India (24 925), Russia (19 744), Philippines (18 876), Iran (17 397), Malaysia (14 345), and Thailand (10 919) have reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. A global total of 8006 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 18 Sep 2021 to late 19 Sep 2021). A total of 52 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 27 of the 52 countries are from the European region, 7 are from the Americas region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 5 are from the South East Asia region, 5 are from the Western Pacific region, and 2 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 2.9%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 2.3%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 1.0% increase in daily reported cases and 19.6% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 500 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 229.81 million cumulative reported cases and over 4.71 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
