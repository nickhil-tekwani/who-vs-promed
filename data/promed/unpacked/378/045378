The assistant national director for public health with the Health Service Executive has said an outbreak of salmonellosis in north Dublin has been isolated to a single producer, who was providing food for a number of parties on the weekend of 13 May 2017.

Dr Kevin Kelleher said this is probably the largest outbreak of salmonellosis in Ireland in the past 10 years and the cause of the problem is believed to have been poultry. Speaking on RTÉ's Morning Ireland, he said: "We, on average, get somewhere between 200 and 500 cases of salmonellosis a year over the last decade. This is probably the largest outbreak we've had in that period of time, but then you can understand why that is, because there's been a single event, clearly on that weekend, but there were a large amount of groups involved. As far as we can ascertain, it's poultry."

The Food Safety Authority has named the producer as Flanreil Food Services in O'Dwyer's Pub in Portmarnock. Dr Kelleher said around 50 people were affected. Some were admitted to hospital, but have since been discharged.

He said that people need to be scrupulous about cleanliness and warned people to be careful that food, in particular mince and poultry, is cooked correctly.

[By its very nature, a catering service can be the source of a multifocal outbreak of foodborne disease. Poultry is thought to be the initial source, which could be related to undercooking or issues with kitchen hygiene. - Mod.LL
