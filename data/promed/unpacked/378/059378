The report relates to 2 samples from Tunisia, forwarded by ("originator"): Dr Emiliana Brocchi, National Reference Centre for Vesicular Diseases, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna (IZSLER), Brescia, Italy.

1. WRLFMD Ref No (virus name): TUN/1031/2014
Serotype: O
Batch No: WRLMEG/2014/00010
Location: Somaa, Tunisia
Species: cattle
Date collected: 26 Apr 2014
Date received by WRLFMD: 26 May 2014
Date received for sequencing: n/a
Species: cattle
Material used: epithelial susp

2. WRLFMD Ref No (virus name): TUN/1054/2014
Serotype: O
Batch No: WRLMEG/2014/00010
Location: Sidi Bouzid, Tunisia
Species: cattle
Date collected: 29 Apr 2014
Date received by WRLFMD: 26 May 2014

In both samples, the FMDV-O virus was determined as topotype: ME-SA, genotype/strain: Ind-2001d.

The most closely related viruses were O/LIB/1/2013, O/LIB/11/2013, O/LIB/12/2013, O/LIB/4/2013, O/LIB/5/2013 and O/LIB/7/2013 (identity rate 98.90 per cent).

The most closely related reference strain is O/BHU/3/2009 (identity rate 96.15 per cent).

[Since the start of the epizootic, reportedly on 25 Apr 2014, a total of 77 outbreaks have been notified to the OIE from Tunisia. It would be helpful to note which vaccine strain is currently being applied and to obtain data on its recorded efficacy.

The disease is circulating in 5 of the 7 west Tunisian governorates bordering Algeria. A request for information from Algeria on its foot and mouth disease situation is pending. - Mod.AS
