The Food and Drug Administration is investigating a new outbreak of _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 infection but has not yet identified a source of the pathogen. The only specific information available as of [Wed 29 Dec 2021] is the patient count, which stands at 11. The agency reports that it has begun traceback efforts but it has not named what food or foods it is tracking.

No on-site inspections, sample collection or testing have been initiated by the FDA in relation to the new outbreak. The FDA has not reported what states outbreak patients are from or when the first illness was confirmed. As of [Wed 29 Dec 2021] the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had not posted any information about the new outbreak. This is not unusual for CDC, which generally does not provide outbreak information until a source of infections has been identified.

The FDA will issue public health advisories for outbreak investigations that result in "specific, actionable steps for consumers -- such as throwing out or avoiding specific foods -- to take to protect themselves". Not all recalls and alerts [are linked to] outbreaks of foodborne illness. Not all outbreaks result in recalls.

Outbreak investigations that do not result in specific, actionable steps for consumers may or may not conclusively identify a source or reveal any contributing factors, according to the outbreak table page of the FDA'S Coordinated Outbreak Response and Evaluation Network (CORE). If a source(s) and/or contributing factors are identified that could inform future prevention, FDA commits to providing a summary of those findings, according to CORE officials.
