Kiwifruit [bacterial canker caused by strain] Psa V is taking a firmer
grip, and its spread is more aggressive than expected, the industry
reported. The disease has continued to spread throughout the Te Puke
region in the Bay of Plenty and into new areas. It has now been found
in the Matapihi area, on the outskirts of Tauranga.

"This is seen to be a significant deterioration in the situation, with
spread of the disease outside the previously affected geographic
areas," Seeka Kiwifruit Industries said. Generally across the
industry, detections have increased. A total of 170 orchards have now
been affected across a wide area.

The gold kiwifruit variety continues to be particularly susceptible,
and orchards are generally severely affected, while secondary
infections have been seen in the green variety in only a small number
of cases, with orchards showing only light symptoms. "The spread over
the winter months has been more aggressive than expected," Seeka
said.

The disease has been seen in orchards covering 200 ha of green and 138
ha of gold kiwifruit. In one orchard covering 15.8 ha of gold and 5.57
ha of green, the infected plants have been removed, and there has been
no evidence of further infection to date. In another orchard covering
16.6 ha of gold, efforts to contain the infection have not been
successful. Growers have formed a taskforce to search for a scientific
solution to fight Psa V.

In 2011, _Pseudomonas syringae_ pv. _actinidiae_ (EPPO Alert List)
continued to spread in Italy and was detected for the 1st time in the
following regions:

- Calabria, in some plants of _Actinidia chinensis_ grown in an
orchard in the municipality of Rosarno (Province of Reggio Calabria).
- Campania, in plants of _A. deliciosa_ cv. "Jin Tao." These plants
had been planted in 2010, and the orchard was located in the
municipality of Sessa Auruca (Province of Caserta).
- Friuli-Venezia Giulia, in 4 young orchards of _A. deliciosa_ cv.
"Hayward" located in the municipalities of Bertiolo, Camino al
Tagliamento and Codroipo (province of Udine) and in the greenhouse of
a nursery located in the municipality of Sacile (Province of
Pordenone).

In all regions, emergency measures have been taken to control or
eradicate the bacterial canker of kiwifruit in accordance with the
Italian Ministerial decree of February 2011.

[Bacterial canker of kiwifruit (_Actinidia_ species and hybrids)
caused by _Pseudomonas syringae_ pv. _actinidiae_ was originally
described in Japan in 1989, but its area of origin is uncertain.
Symptoms include discolouration of buds and vascular tissues, leaf
spots, wilting, stem and twig cankers with characteristic red exudate,
fruit collapse, and eventually death of the plant. The disease is
favoured by cool temperatures and high humidity, thus symptoms are
usually seen in spring and autumn.

Data on epidemiology are still lacking, but infection is thought to
occur via natural leaf openings and wounds. The pathogen is suspected
to be spread by heavy rain, strong winds, mechanical means (including
animal and human activities), and infected planting material. Spread
with infected fruit and/or pollen cannot be excluded until conclusive
data become available.

Generally, disease management of bacterial diseases may include
cultural practices, crop rotation, phytosanitation to prevent spread,
use of clean planting material and resistant crop varieties, but
specific control strategies for kiwi canker are being developed.
Chemical control (copper compounds, antibiotics) is used in Japan, but
resistant pathogen strains have emerged.

A recent outbreak in Italy (ProMED-mail post 20100414.1207) affecting
25 percent of the Zespri Gold variety vines was found to be due to the
emergence of a new, very virulent strain, Psa V. In New Zealand, 2
separate pathogen strains have been identified including the virulent
Psa V.
