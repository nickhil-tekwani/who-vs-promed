Rabies in the Belgorodskaya Oblast
---------------------------------------------
Public Health officials in the Belgorod region [Belgorodskaya Oblast]
have stated that a resident of the Starooskol city district has been
hospitalized with a diagnosis of rabies virus infection. A group of
experts has arrived in the village where the victim lives to
investigate the disease situation. It was established that about one
month ago a a domestic cat had bitten the finger of an elderly woman.
The woman treated the wound with iodine and did not seek further
medical treatment.

The cat disappeared sometime after the incident and has not been
traced. A month after this incident (on 2 Dec 2008) the woman
complained of indisposition and apprehension. Her temperature rose up
to 40. and she exhibited symptoms of vomiting, shortness of breath,
speech disability because of throat spasms, aerophobia, and sweating.
Doctors at a local hospital and the city hospital made a preliminary
diagnosed of rabies. The patient's condition is giving concern and
she has been transferred to an intensive care unit.

People in her village who may have had contact with the ailing cat
have been admitted to hospital for examination and are receiving
anti-rabies prophylaxis. Veterinarians are vaccinating pet animals.

During 10 months of 2008 174 laboratory confirmed cases of rabies
infection of animals have been recorded. The existence of a high
rabies incidence among animals is casing concern. The large number of
neglected animals inhabiting the streets of cities and throughout the
region is also a matter of concern. In 2008, 40 percent of cases of
animal bites were caused by feral cats and dogs. During the first 9
months of 2008, 3600 persons sought medical treatment for animal
bites. That is 15.2 percent more than in 2007. The public are
reminded that immediate treatment should be sought after any animal
bite. In particular hunters should be aware that wild foxes are a
reservoir of rabies virus infection in this region.
