A Treasure Coast [Florida] man is recovering from a flesh-eating bacterial infection that took over his leg in a constellation-like pattern, starting with a cut he got on his ankle. "Diarrhea, fatigued, not to mention waking up every day with the weight of what is wrong with me, and am I going to be okay?" the patient said of his 4-week progression since contracting _Vibrio vulnificus_. He believes it was at the Stuart sandbar where he cut his foot. The potentially lethal bacterium thrives in salt water in hot summer months.

_V. vulnificus_ infected 30 people last year [2013] and killed 10 in Florida.

The patient says he knows he became infected at the popular Stuart sandbar, where after he cut his foot, he became incredibly sick. "I was walking through the water about knee deep and I had an anchor cut my ankle," he said. Days later he noticed a painful sore develop, and fatigue set in; "I noticed my calf started to get a blistery infection that started to pop up on it. My thigh up here broke out in the same blistery rash." Within a week, the infection from _V. vulnificus_ caused fatigue and severe swelling that discolored his entire leg, and then the patient rushed to get treatment.

Nearly 50 per cent of cases are fatal, and more than half require amputation. CDC [US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] receives reports of over 400 vibrio illnesses each year. Most vibrio illness occurs during warm weather months.

The infection has just been reported to the Martin County Health Department, but so far no one has conclusively linked it to the water here.

[The following is extracted from the "Bad Bug Book," Center for Safety and Applied Nutrition, US FDA (Food and Drug Administration), at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/UCM297627.pdf:

_Vibrio vulnificus_, a lactose-fermenting, halophilic, Gram negative, opportunistic pathogen, is found in estuarine environments and is associated with various marine species such as plankton, shellfish (oysters, clams, and crabs), and finfish. Environmental factors responsible for controlling numbers of _V. vulnificus_ in seafood and in the environment include temperature, pH [acidity], salinity, and amounts of dissolved organics. It may be normal flora in salt water, and acquiring this organism from shellfish or water exposure does not imply that the water is contaminated by sewage.

Wound infections result either from contaminating an open wound with sea water harboring the organism or by lacerating part of the body on coral, fish, etc., followed by contamination with the organism. The ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in gastroenteritis.

The "primary septicemia" form of the disease follows consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals with underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease. The organism can also enter through damaged skin. In these individuals, the microorganism enters the blood stream, resulting in septic shock, rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50 percent). Over 70 per cent of infected individuals have distinctive bullous skin lesions (shown at http://safeoysters.org/medical/diagnosis.html).

There are 2 points to be emphasized: that vibrios are normal flora in warm saltwater (not indicative of any sewage contamination), and that most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. So-called normal individuals often just get gastroenteritis. The range of disease due to _V. vulnificus_ can include more northern geographical areas if the area is affected by a substantial heat wave. - Mod.LL
