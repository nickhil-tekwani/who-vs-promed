Fears of Impending Outbreak of Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome Discounted
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
TAIPEI: Dozens of Taiwan residents have rushed to hospitals as fears mount
over an outbreak of a [hantavirus infection, carried by rats. Although
authorities have said they will attempt to obliterate the island's
population of 80 million rats, some residents have taken action against the
rodents themselves.
A hantavirus is suspected to have caused the death of a couple in Hualien
county in eastern Taiwan last month [January 2001. The couple died after
their lungs filled with fluid, a common result of hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome. Health authorities initially confirmed that at least one of
[those who died had been infected with the virus, but later said more
testing was needed.
Health officials declared that it was far too late to expect rodent
extermination to reduce the threat posed by the hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome. "The common sewer rat has long carried the Seoul-type
hantavirus," Department of Health adviser Chin Chuan told Taiwan's TVBS
cable TV network. "It's highly likely that many Taiwan residents have been
infected before with Seoul virus. But the effects of Seoul virus infection
are far less serious than infection [with some other hantaviruses such as
Sin Nombre virus which was responsible for the outbreak in the
southwestern United States in the early 1990s that killed roughly half the
people who [became infected." Dr Chin said that he blamed sensational
media reports for contributing to the scare in Taiwan. "The hantavirus that
has been found in Taiwan is the Seoul virus, which only causes death in one
per cent of patients."
