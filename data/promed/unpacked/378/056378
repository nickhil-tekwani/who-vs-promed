Australian bat lyssavirus infection in three fruit bats from north
Queensland;Speare R, et. al:
Abstract: We report the case findings of Australian bat lyssavirus
infection in two black flying foxes (Pteropus alecto) and one little red
flying fox (Pteropus scapulatus) from north Queensland between January
1995 and August 1996. Although the P. alecto case in January 1995 is the
first recognised case of Australian bat lyssavirus infection in
Australia, this was a retrospective diagnosis made after identification
of the index case at Ballina in May 1996. Eight persons had exposure to
the three bats. Serum antibodies to classical rabies virus were measured
in six of these persons; the only one seropositive was a veterinarian
who had previously been vaccinated against rabies. Six persons received
rabies vaccine following exposure. None of the in-contact humans
developed signs of lyssavirus infection. For people exposed to
Australian bat lyssavirus-positive bats who have not been scratched or
bitten or had mucosal contamination by these bats, we suggest a
post-exposure regime of five inoculations of the human diploid cell
inactivated rabies vaccine.
Human contacts: Two of the people who had contact with the three
Australian bat lyssavirus infected bats received a post-exposure
vaccination regime for rabies using the five-inoculation regime. Three
of the remaining six chose to receive the three-inoculation pre-exposure
regime, due to the lack of any penetrating wounds. This variation in
management of humans exposed to lyssavirus-positive bats may reflect the
lack of information available prior to the November 1996 guidelines of
the Lyssavirus Expert Group. Two veterinarians had already been fully
immunised against rabies, and both had protective levels of antibody.
The delays between potential exposure to Australian bat lyssavirus and
post-exposure vaccination were due to several factors. Lyssavirus
infection in two fruit bats was retrospectively diagnosed on archived
specimens, leading to a delay in discovering the infection status of the
bats. Lack of knowledge by individuals about the potential of Australian
bat lyssavirus to cause disease in humans or animals other than bats
resulted in poor motivation to seek vaccination. Results from
pathogenicity studies on the Ballina isolate at the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention were not available until early November 1996, and
the death of a human occurred after the cases described here. Prior to
the meeting of the Lyssavirus Expert Group in November 1996, protocols
concerning actions to be taken after exposure to Australian bat
lyssavirus were not defined.
The Lyssavirus Expert Group noted that inapparent exposure to lyssavirus
could occur . The current guidelines do not offer any definite advice
for people who have been exposed to a lyssavirus-positive bat, but who
are not aware of receiving any penetrating wound or contamination of
mucous membranes with secretions. We suggest that such persons should
receive the standard five-inoculation post-exposure regime using killed
human diploid cell rabies vaccine.
