A rabid bull has bitten a woman in the Vinnytska oblast. The woman
who lives in the village Juravlevka of Tulchinskaya rayon has
suffered a bite from her own bull. She was immediately hospitalized
for treatment. The veterinarians later confirmed that the bull was
indeed sick with rabies.

[Rabies is endemic and used to be wide-spread in Ukraine, vectored by
foxes and wolves. The recently applied oral vaccination was expected
to reduce its incidence. The rabid bull had, most probably, been
infected from a carnivore, either domestic (dog, cat), straying, or a
wild animal, several weeks before the appearance of disease signs.
This may have been unnoticed by the owner.

Generally, rabies in herbivores is, like in humans, a dead-end
disease. An owner, handler or an attending veterinarian may become
exposed to rabies themselves by searching, bare handed, for an
offending foreign body in a choking animal.

Rabies may present in cattle in either of 2 forms. In the furious
form, normally docile animals may attack humans and other animals,
though biting is rather rare. Milk production ceases abruptly in
dairy cattle. The cow may appear hypersensitive and will follow
sounds and movements intensely. The affected cattle may exhibit
abnormal bellowing which may continue intermittently, or voiceless
attempts to bellow described as yawning. Those who have heard this
sound once will recognize it readily.

In the paralytic form, the 1st sign may be paralysis of the throat.
Drooling of saliva, grinding of the teeth, extension of the head, and
bloat may occur. The cow may appear to be choking. Laryngeal
paralysis can cause a change in vocalizations, including the
aforementioned abnormal bellow, though this is more common in the
furious form. Weakness in the hindquarters may occur and is always
accompanied by decreased sensation to the affected area. Paralysis of
the anus and penis in the bull may be seen. Eventually the animal
will go down and be unable to get up as paralysis becomes complete.
These animals do not attack others.

It will be interesting to note if the bull described above indeed
actually bit the owner. - Mod.AS]
