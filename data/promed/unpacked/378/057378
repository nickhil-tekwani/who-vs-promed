For Immediate Release
First Cases of Anthrax in 2001 Reported in Uvalde
and Val Verde Counties, Texas; Producers in Area
Urged to Vaccinate
Two cases of anthrax have been confirmed in deer
from Uvalde and Val Verde Counties in Southwest
Texas, and livestock health officials are urging
producers in the area to consult their private
veterinary practitioners about vaccinating livestock
against this disease that resurfaces periodically.
Many long-time ranchers in the area have
experienced sporadic outbreaks and routinely
inoculate their livestock against this disease that is
weather-dependent and can develop during warm
spring and summer months.
"When livestock graze in an affected pasture, they
can ingest spores that are on the grass or ground.
Historically, most of Texas' cases each year occur
in a triangle bounded by Uvalde, Ozona and Eagle
Pass," explained Dr. Dan Baca, a veterinary
epidemiologist with the Texas Animal Health
Commission (TAHC), the state's livestock health
regulatory agency.
Anthrax is a reportable disease in Texas. While
laboratory tests, conducted by the Texas
Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory in
College Station, are needed to confirm infection,
Dr. Baca said suspected cases also are to be
reported to the TAHC at 1-800-550-8242. A
veterinarian is available to take calls 24 hours a
day. If outbreaks occur in dairy animals, Dr. Baca
advised producers to call the TAHC immediately
for assistance to prevent potential human exposure
through milk products.
Signs of the disease in livestock and deer can
include sudden death, rapid bloating of the
carcass, and blood oozing from body openings.
"Hunters often ask about anthrax, and by the time
hunting season starts, cool weather usually puts an
end to any cases," said Dr. Baca. "However, my
best advice always is to shoot only healthy-
looking animals. By the time an animal displays
signs of anthrax that can include staggering,
trembling or convulsions, death is inevitable."
