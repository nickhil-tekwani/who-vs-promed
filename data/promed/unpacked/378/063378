Epidemic Affecting the Population of Mekhatria (North of Ain Defla)
-----------------------
One person died this past Thursday [13 Feb 2003] as a result of
complications of an unknown illness currently threatening the lives of
approximately 50 families in the municipality of Mekhatria, located north
of the city of Ain Defla (the wilaya's main town). According to
well-informed sources, the decedent, a 20-year-old male, had been ill for
more than a week. After having been hospitalized at the Ain Defla, he was
then transferred to the nearest capital city hospital. In addition,
according to local sources, several people belonging to 50 families are
already showing the clinical signs that were observed in the deceased. No
medical team has been sent to the scene to report the effects of this
epidemic. Worried citizens have asked for a medical team as soon as possible.

[Speculation on the etiology of this reported outbreak would be foolish in
the absence of a description of the clinical illness. More information on
this apparent outbreak would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
