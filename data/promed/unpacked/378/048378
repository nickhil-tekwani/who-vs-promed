Two children died of measles of the 76 cases registered since January 2014 in the area of Lusangi in Kabambare territory (Maniema).

The Provincial Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Maniema delivered these numbers in its weekly report published Wednesday [26 Feb 2014] in Kindu. According to the report, the disease affects mainly children aged 1-5 years. 54 of the 76 reported cases of measles are in this age group. In many areas of the hinterland, many parents refuse to vaccinate their children because of their religious beliefs or superstition.

[Measles is a major public health problem. It is a viral disease affecting mainly children and those who are unvaccinated. The paradox is that it is an infectious disease against which there is an effective vaccine available. Traditional beliefs hinder healthcare utilization and, therefore, vaccination against the disease.

Extensive awareness campaigns should be undertaken to encourage coverage in general and against measles specifically.

204 measles cases with 2 deaths have been recorded since the beginning of the year [2014] in Likasi.

Medical inspector of health district Likasi released these figures after the weekly meeting of epidemiological surveillance on Wed 26 Feb 2014. Dr. Gaspard Ilunga Dipata announced a vaccination campaign against measles [to begin] by 11 Mar 2014.

The vaccination campaign, lasting 5 days and organized by the health district, will target children aged 6 months to 10 years, said the medical inspector of health district Likasi. He also discussed strengthening epidemiological surveillance as one of the measures to be taken against measles: "We want to hear [about] all cases in order to organize support. We also asked health zones to raise awareness outside communities, churches and schools," he said.

The health areas most affected are Kikula and Kapolowe, according to Dr. Gaspard Ilunga Dipata.

Fraser Health has issued an outbreak warning to residents of Fraser East communities after confirming 2 cases of measles, with dozens more cases suspected. The health authority's warning extends to residents living in Abbotsford, Mission, Chilliwack, Agassiz, Harrison Hot Springs, and Hope.

"The most recent exposure to this highly contagious virus has occurred in a school in Chilliwack in a community with traditionally low immunization rates," Fraser Health said in a written statement Saturday [8 Mar 2014] afternoon. "Two confirmed cases of measles have been reported, and Fraser Health is following up on dozens of linked suspected cases," it said.

Chief Medical Health Officer Dr. Paul Van Buynder says the agency is concerned about the potential for the virus to spread during spring break travel. "We are urging individuals who may have been exposed to the virus to contact their local Public Health Unit to be cleared before travelling during spring break," he said in a written statement. "The potential for this virus to spread as a result is very concerning. ... We are encouraging everyone who has not yet been vaccinated against measles to contact their doctor or health provider to receive the free MMR vaccine."

Fraser Health said its staff are contacting affected families directly to offer immunoglobulin or vaccine, which is free to anyone born in or after 1957. Fraser Health says relatively low immunization rates in some parts of Fraser Valley's eastern areas have led to clusters of measles outbreaks in previous years; including an outbreak last fall [2013].

Childhood vaccines were being blamed for high rates of autism in the United States a few years ago. As a result, many parents refused to have their children vaccinated against common childhood diseases. With that backlash comes a new measles outbreak, with 53 people in 10 states contracting measles over the past 2 months.

The return of measles and, to a lesser degree, mumps can be traced to the backlash against vaccines. Pockets of under-immunized children have left an unknown number of communities vulnerable to the virus.

Alarmed officials say the highly contagious disease was all but eradicated in the United States 10 years ago. Unvaccinated children and adults have been diagnosed with the sometimes fatal disease in outbreaks in California, New York, Oregon, Hawaii and Texas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [also in Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Illinois elsewhere in this report. - Mod.LM].

"We don't have good national data, or even any data, that show how large a threat these (unvaccinated) clusters are," Gregory Wallace, the center's point man for measles and other infectious diseases, says.

Among those who refuse to have their children vaccinated are conservative parents who reject the government's interfering with their child rearing; orthodox religious groups that dislike vaccines for being man-made and not god-given, and well-educated, health-conscious, affluent and Internet-literate parents don't see vaccines as organic or natural. Immigrants from countries with poor health care systems are also often under-inoculated.

Each U.S. measles outbreak has been sparked by an unvaccinated traveler returning from an infected region to an under-immunized pocket or school district. Last year [2013] was a record-breaking year for measles, with 189 cases, most of them related to communities with religious objections to immunizations, a huge jump from 55 cases in 2012.

No one knows how many unimmunized children there are in the United States, but public health experts say the danger is growing.

"It is a problem that's increasing; we are seeing more families express concerns about immunizations," Salt Lake City pediatrician Carrie Byington, vice chair of the committee on infectious diseases for the American Association of Pediatrics, says.

The under-vaccinated "are at great risk and pose a risk to others in the community."

A 5th Orange County resident has been diagnosed with measles, and public health officials on Friday [7 Mar 2014] warned that others may have been exposed earlier this week at St. Joseph Hospital in Orange.

Health Care Agency spokeswoman Nicole Stanfield said it's unknown how the unidentified adult contracted the illness. She said the patient's vaccination history is also uncertain.

The person was at St. Joseph's emergency department on Sunday [2 Mar 2014] from 4:30-8:30 p.m. and Monday [3 Mar 2014] from 7:30 p.m.-5:00 a.m.

Officials said the risk of getting sick after brief encounters is low, but as a precaution, those who were at St. Joseph's at the same time should review whether they've received the MMR vaccine for measles, mumps, and rubella. If not, they should discuss getting vaccinated with a medical provider. They should also monitor themselves for symptoms, which can develop between 7 and 21 days after exposure, starting with a fever, cough, and runny nose. Two to 4 days later, a red, blotchy rash develops, usually starting around the ears and hairline and then moving to the face, torso and limbs. Anyone with symptoms should immediately contact a doctor.

In December [2013], the 1st local measles case was diagnosed, with 3 more following in January and February 2014. Two of the patients had traveled to Asia. In a typical year, Orange County sees no more than one case.

State officials have also seen a surge in cases and have noted that about half were children and young adults who were intentionally not vaccinated.

Those who attended a junior high school volleyball game in Bushnell on Tue 25 Feb 2014, might have been exposed to the measles.

The McDonough County Health Department reported that a person who was at the match between Bushnell and Macomb has become the 2nd confirmed measles case in the county in the past 2 weeks. The agency said a letter has been sent to the school where the person attends to notify parents of the confirmed case.

Measles is highly contagious. It is a viral disease spread through breathing, coughing, and sneezing, and it can be spread up to 2 hours after the infected person has left the area.

The health department said anyone born after 1956 who attended the volleyball match should make sure they've received 2 vaccinations for measles/mumps/rubella, or have already had measles. Those who have not should contact the health department at 309-837-9951.

The 1st confirmed case of measles this year [2014] in McDonough County was reported on Wed 26 Feb 2014. The health department said a young child who was visiting Macomb contracted the illness.

Health officials have confirmed 2 more cases of measles in Massachusetts. The [Massachusetts] Department of Public Health says the residents live in Middlesex County. The DPH did not release any other details about the patients. There have been a total of 6 cases of measles in Massachusetts this year [2014].

The measles look and feel like a cold at 1st. Patients may develop a cough, fever, runny rose and red watery eyes. These 1st symptoms start about 10 days after infection. A few days later, a red blotchy rash starts on the face then spreads to the rest of the body.

According to the DPH, measles is a very contagious disease that usually lasts a week or 2. It can cause serious problems like ear infections, pneumonia, swelling of the brain in some people, especially pregnant women, infants, and those with weakened immune systems. Adults are also at increased risk for severe disease and may need to be hospitalized due to complications.

The DPH has the following tips for people who believe they may have been exposed to measles.

- If you were born in the U.S. before 1957, it is very likely that you are immune to measles. However, to increase the likelihood you are protected against measles, mumps and rubella, consider receiving a dose of MMR vaccine.

- If you were born in the US on or after 1957, and you do not have documentation of having 2 doses of MMR or measles-containing vaccine or serologic evidence of immunity, you must receive a dose of vaccine as soon as possible.

- If you were born outside of the US (regardless of year of birth), and you do not have documentation of having 2 doses of MMR or measles-containing vaccine, or serologic evidence of immunity, you should call your provider to receive a dose of vaccine as soon as possible. A blood test showing you are protected against measles is also acceptable evidence of immunity. However, a past history of measles disease is not adequate proof of immunity.

If you develop symptoms of measles, please stay home and call your doctor.

A measles advisory has been issued in New York City after health officials confirmed 16 cases in northern Manhattan and the Bronx. Seven adult cases and 9 pediatric cases have been reported to date, as opposed to the normal 5 to 10 in the city all year.

What's also troubling is that at least 2 cases were transmitted right in a doctor's office. "One can understand how that happened, but that's exactly why we're trying to minimize the opportunity for future exposure," said Dr. Jane Zucker of the New York City Health Department.

New Yorkers are urged to make sure all household members, including young children, are vaccinated. To date, there have been 4 hospitalizations as a result of this outbreak.

The outbreak impacts the following zip codes: 10034, 10040, 10033, 10032, 10451, and 10453, which include northern Manhattan and the Melrose and Morris Heights sections of the Bronx.

Measles is a highly contagious viral infection characterized by a generalized rash and high fever, accompanied by cough, red eyes, and runny nose, lasting 5 to 6 days. The illness typically begins with a rash on the face and then moves down the body, and may include the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.

People who contract the measles virus can spread the infection for 4 days before developing a rash and for 4 days after the rash sets in. Measles can spread easily through the air to unprotected individuals. If you suspect you have measles, call and explain your symptoms to your doctor or medical provider before leaving to avoid exposing others to the measles virus.

The Department of Health is working with New York City hospitals to prevent additional exposure to the virus in emergency departments. The health department is also asking pediatric-care facilities in Manhattan and the Bronx to identify and vaccinate children who have not received the MMR vaccine and to give the 2nd dose of MMR vaccine to children at the next medical visit.

Adults who are unsure of their vaccination history can be revaccinated or obtain a blood test to see whether they are immune. Several adults who are included in this outbreak thought they had been vaccinated in the past, but lacked documentation.

As many as one in 3 people with measles develop complications. These complications from measles can be very serious and include pneumonia, miscarriage, brain inflammation, hospitalization, and even death. Infants under one year of age, people who have a weakened immune system, and non-immune pregnant women are at highest risk of severe illness and complications.

The Rhode Island Department of Health is working with 2 area hospitals to reach patients that it says may have been exposed to a person who likely had measles.

The Health Department said in a news release Sunday [2 Mar 2014] that it is working with Rhode Island Hospital and Roger Williams Medical Center because the person with measles was in both hospitals last week.

"The 1st potential exposure took place on 25 Feb 2014 at Roger Williams Medical Center, where a man was treated for a sore throat and fever. On 28 Feb 2014, that person developed a rash and was seen at the CVS Minute Clinic in North Attleboro, Massachusetts, and the possibility of measles was recognized," the Health Department said. "He was referred to the Rhode Island Hospital Emergency Department, where he was until early on 1 Mar 2014. Physicians there agreed that the clinical presentation was consistent with measles."

The man stayed in the emergency department until early on 1 Mar 2014 and then was discharged to remain isolated at home. The news release said the man has no history of vaccination against measles.

The measles diagnosis has not yet been confirmed by lab studies, the news release said, but the case meets federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for probable measles. HEALTH and CDC recommend that people who were potentially exposed to the index case be identified and their vaccination status updated.

The Health Department gives the following instructions for anyone who may have been exposed but has not been contacted by Monday [3 Mar 2014]:

- If you were at the Roger Williams Medical Center's Emergency Room between 3 p.m. and 10 p.m. on Tue 25 Feb 2014, call 401-456-2434 or 401-456-2092.

- If you were at Rhode Island Hospital's emergency room between 5:30 p.m. on Fri 28 Feb 2014, and 3:30 a.m. Sat 1 Mar 2014, call 401-444-5600.

- If you were at the CVS Minute Clinic in North Attleboro between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. on Fri 28 Feb 2014, call 401-222-8022 if you're a Rhode Island resident or 617-983-6800 if you're a Massachusetts resident.

Measles is a contagious respiratory disease that usually lasts a week or 2. Most people recover without any problems. In rare cases, complications such as pneumonia and brain infections can occur. The virus that causes measles lives in the nose and throat and is spread into the air when an infected person coughs or talks. Measles can stay in the air for up to 2 hours after the contagious person has left the room and can cause infection when inhaled by a susceptible person.

At 1st, measles looks and feels like a cold. Common symptoms are cough, runny nose, high fever and red, watery eyes. Symptoms begin 10 to 14 days after exposure. A few days later, a red blotchy rash begins on the face then spreads to the rest of the body.

A person with measles is infectious for 4 days before developing the rash and remains infectious until 4 days after the rash started. The best protection against measles after exposure is vaccination as soon as possible, preferably within 3 days, the news release said. Measles vaccine is included in the MMR vaccine. MMR cannot be given to infants younger than one year, pregnant women, and those who are immunocompromised. But there is an alternative. Immune globulin can help protect against the measles if taken within a week of exposure, the Health Department said.

A number of children in Hanoi and other northern provinces are experiencing a 2nd measles breakout this year [2014].

Most of the children infected have yet to receive vaccinations, said Professor Tien Dung, head of Pediatrics Ward of Bach Mai Hospital in Hanoi. The ward is treating 30 children with serious cases. Three of the children have developed severe pneumonia.

The wet weather in the north is a favorable condition for the virus, said Nguyen Nhat Cam, director of the Preventive Medicine Center in Hanoi.

To prevent further infections, parents and teachers with infected children should quarantine them from public areas until completely healed.

Dr Nguyen Tri Dung, director of the Preventive Medicine Center, warned of disease outbreaks in schools on [5 Mar 2014]. The city is facing various outbreaks of diseases including measles and dengue in the past 2 months, said Dr Dung. The wet weather is a good environment for spread of the viruses.

The Children Hospitals No. 1 and 2 and the Tropical Disease Hospital received more than 200 serious measles cases in the 1st 2 months of 2014. The Department of Health will be dispensing vaccinations to children under 3 years old from [7 Mar to the end of April 2014].

The health and education centers are currently working together to raise public awareness of disease prevention.

[It seems that measles outbreaks are still occurring in Viet Nam despite the efforts of health authorities to increase the coverage of measles vaccination.

The 1st newswire above mentions a 2nd measles breakout in Hanoi, and the 2nd newswire reports more than 200 cases in Ho Chi Minh City. However, they provide no update on the number of measles cases in Viet Nam.

As previously reported, by 15 Feb 2014, more than 993 measles cases had been reported since the beginning of 2014 from 24 provinces and cities. The cases were mainly from Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, and northern mountainous provinces.

An official of the Department of Health in Davao Region expressed concern over the reported measles outbreak in Davao City.

Dr. Abdullah Dumama, Jr., regional director of the Department of Health 11, said that by its latest definition, even one case of measles is already an outbreak, as it leads to contamination of 18 persons. He said 14 out of 300 cases have been confirmed already, but they were already given outbreak-response-immunization.

"But it is not yet enough, not until everybody is attended to. Children less than 5-years-old must be brought to the health centers with or without history of vaccination," Dumama said. He stressed that the reported 2 deaths attributed to measles are already significantly alarming. Dumama also revealed that the 2 latest mortalities involved children 7 and 8 months old. He said children up to 9 months old are easily afflicted with measles.

Dumama stressed that in the 2 cases it no longer followed that the children carried their mothers' immunity. "It implies that their mothers did not undergo immunization or the mothers never had measles, thus the need for everyone to undergo anti-measles vaccination," he said.

Dumama also said that the 2 mortality cases in Calinan and Buhangin, respectively, were discovered to have been sick for 10 and 14 days respectively, earlier, before they were brought to the doctor. "It took time for them to get proper medical care," he said.

Dumama appealed to the barangay captains and barangay health workers to check among their residents, particularly children, with symptoms attributed to measles and to bring them immediately to the Southern Philippines Medical Center for treatment. He said measles cases have been monitored also in Talomo, Agdao, and almost everywhere in Davao City.

A measles outbreak has been declared in 6 cities and 17 municipalities of Cavite, the Provincial Health Office (PHO) said yesterday [8 Mar 2014].

Dr. George R. Repique, head of PHO, said that latest surveillance updates revealed that 3 persons have died and that 734 measles cases have been reported in the province, with the cities of Dasmarinas, Bacoor and Imus and General Trias and Silang having the largest numbers of cases.

Repique clarified that the province's measles situation is not alarming as it has been under control and checked with the step-up measures and remedies undertaken by the PHO and city and municipality health offices and the provincial government.

"One measles case is considered an outbreak. The measles virus has stricken all cities and municipalities of the province, but measures and remedies have been undertaken," he said.

The surgeon officer said that high risk communities have been identified and that all concerned offices were given guidance on measles incidence, as well as other communicable viruses in the area.

Just last Friday, Governor Jonvic Remulla and Repique led an assembly that called for a campaign in the fight against measles and polio at Cavite Collaboration Center for Public Health here.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a travel notice today [4 Mar 2014] for travelers to the Philippines in light of the measles outbreak on the archipelago.

The CDC notes that the Department of Health of the Philippines has reported 1163 cases of measles and a number of measles deaths in the country from 1-11 Jan 2014. Most of the cases are from Metropolitan Manila, Calabarzon, and Central Luzon. Countries reporting cases in travelers returning from the Philippines include Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and United States.

In fact, NBC news reported Monday [3 Mar 2014] that of the 54 confirmed measles cases reported in the US so far in 2014, at least a dozen of them had recently traveled to the Philippines. The World Health Organization and the Philippines Department of Health are working to control the outbreak, including conducting outbreak response vaccination activities.

The CDC recommends that travelers to the Philippines protect themselves by making sure they are properly vaccinated against measles. In addition, the federal health agency recommends you practice good hygiene and cleanliness.

Measles (rubeola) is classified as a member of the genus _Morbillivirus_ in the family Paramyxoviridae. Measles is a highly contagious rash illness that is transmitted from person to person by direct contact with respiratory droplets or airborne spread. After exposure, up to 90 percent of susceptible persons develop measles. The average incubation period for measles is 10 to 12 days from exposure to prodrome and 14 days from exposure to rash (range: 7-21 days).

Persons with measles are infectious 4 days before through 4 days after rash onset. In the United States, from 1987 to 2000, the most commonly reported complications associated with measles infection were pneumonia (6 percent), otitis media (7 percent), and diarrhea (8 percent) (8). For every 1000 reported measles cases in the United States, approximately one case of encephalitis and 2 to 3 deaths resulted.

As of 9:29 pm on 6 Mar 2014, Public Health officers are concerned that Auckland could be on the brink of a measles outbreak. They say 2 passengers had measles when they were on Flight NZ 136 from Brisbane to Auckland last Sunday.

An Auckland medical officer of health, Richard Hoskins, says the passengers who were sitting close by will be traced. He says there have been 58 cases of measles in Auckland so far this year [2014], and officials are worried the disease will spread. Measles symptoms can include a high fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and a rash that starts on the face and neck before spreading elsewhere.
