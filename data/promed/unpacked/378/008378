Bird flu is linked to global trade in poultry; Migrating birds no
longer seen as culprit in outbreaks
-----------------------------------------------
Most of the scattered bird flu outbreaks so far this year [2007]
probably can be traced to illegal or improper trade in poultry,
scientists believe. This probably includes recent outbreaks in
Nigeria and Egypt as well as the large outbreak on a turkey farm in
England.
Last winter, wild migrating birds were deemed the primary culprit in
the bird flu infestations that hop scotched across Europe and Africa.
Dead swans and ducks were found in many countries, including Austria,
France and Italy. "Many of us at the outset underestimated the role
of trade," said Samuel Jutzi, director of Animal Production and
Health at the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization in
Rome. "The virus is behaving rather differently than last year
[2006]; it's rather enigmatic."
No outbreaks have been attributed to wild birds so far this season,
and not a single infected wild bird has been detected in Europe or
Africa, despite a heightened surveillance system devised in the wake
of the crisis last year [2006]. In most of the world, there have been
far fewer outbreaks compared to a similar period in 2006. In Europe,
there has been only one in Hungary in January 2007, and another this
month [February 2007] on a turkey farm in Suffolk, England.
Although they have not reached a final conclusion, investigators from
the Food and Agriculture Organization and the British government
suspect that trade may have set off those outbreaks. The large
poultry farm that was the site of the outbreak in Suffolk was owned
by a company, Bernard Matthews, that also raises birds in Hungary, a
spokeswoman for the British Department for Environment, Food and
Rural Affairs, which is investigating the outbreak, said Monday [12
Feb 2007]. Partially processed meat was routinely shipped from the
company's Hungarian farm to the one in Suffolk for final processing.
Although the avian influenza virus is killed by cooking, it survives
well in raw meat, and such shipments may have brought it into England
and onto the property. It could have been transported from the
processing plant into the animal pens on workers' shoes or farm
equipment.
In Africa and Asia, several countries have emerged this season as
perpetual bird flu trouble spots, with constant cases in birds and
some transmission to humans: Indonesia in Asia and Egypt and Nigeria
in Africa. Trade may play a role in these countries as well,
officials said. "There's still some way to go in these 3 places,"
Jutzi said. "In most places where we've seen outbreaks this year --
like South Korea, the U.K., Thailand, Viet Nam -- the disease has
reemerged as we expected it would from time to time, but we're
confident that it has been brought under control."
Although bird flu was presumed to be under control in Nigeria late
last year [2006], "there has been a recrudescence in recent months,"
said Tony Forman, a scientist with the UN team. "It used to be
primarily in big poultry farms, but now we're seeing it in small
farms and backyard flocks." Forman said there was "fairly good
circumstantial evidence" that illegal poultry imports and transport
were responsible for bird flu problems in Egypt and Nigeria,
particularly of eggs and chicks. Such trade is very hard to trace and
control, if only because of the volume. "The poultry sector is the
most globalized in agriculture," Jutzi said. "There is incredible
movement of chicks and other products."
Scientists are unsure why wild birds have not been implicated in
spreading bird flu this year [2007], although they speculate it might
have to do with warmer weather. Last year, extremely cold weather in
areas in Central Asia where bird flu is endemic might have forced
birds like swans that normally do not migrate very far to travel
longer distances across Europe.

Canadian wild bird survey for 2006 finds no highly pathogenic avian flu viruses
-----------------------------------------------
A Canadian study that tested more than 12 000 live and dead wild
birds for avian influenza viruses turned up no cases of the highly
pathogenic Asian strain of H5N1 viruses in 2006, the Canadian Food
Inspection Agency announced Friday [9 Feb 2007].
In fact, initial analysis of viruses from tested birds showed no
evidence of any highly pathogenic strains of avian influenza, H5 or
otherwise, and none from the families of viruses found in wild birds
that travel flyways through Europe and Asia, said Patrick Zimmer,
director of policy and administration for the Canadian Co-operative
Wildlife Health Centre. "So far, they're just what would be expected
as far as the normal kind of North American strains that are
circulating in these wild birds as a reservoir," Zimmer said from
Saskatoon, where the centre is headquartered. The centre conducted
the study for the federal, provincial and territorial governments.
The jury is still out over whether the Asian H5N1 viruses causing
poultry outbreaks and occasional human deaths through parts of Asia,
the Middle East and Africa are likely to make their way to North
America via wild birds. Years of analysis of the genetic blueprints
of avian flu viruses suggests there are distinct families or lineages
of viruses found in birds that travel the flyways of the Americas and
those that migrate through Eurasia.
The 2006 survey was the 2nd annual effort to conduct a census of
which avian flu viruses wild birds in this country carry. Wild water
birds like ducks, terns, sandpipers and snow geese are infected with
and shed avian flu viruses with little impact on their own health.
As in 2005, several H5 viruses were found: an H5N9 in Alberta, 2
H5N2s in Quebec and one in British Columbia. And there was one H5N1
virus found in Prince Edward Island. All the H5 viruses were of low
pathogenicity, meaning they don't kill chickens. There were no H7
viruses found. The initial analysis of the samples focused on H5 and
H7 viruses, because these 2 subtypes are the only kinds of avian
influenza viruses known to be able to scale up in virulence from low
pathogenicity to what is known as highly pathogenic or high path
viruses.
Zimmer said additional work must now be done to subtype the other flu
viruses found among the live and dead birds to see what was
circulating among wild birds in Canada last summer [2006].
In addition to details of sampling done in Canada, the survey report
includes sampling done in Ecuador and Iceland. Zimmer said
Environment Canada received about 400 samples from Iceland, which
does bird banding, and ran tests on them at CFIA's laboratory in
Winnipeg.

[ProMED thanks Mary Marshall for submitting the same report.
I think that we can confidently assume that the US wild bird study in
Alaska will reveal similar findings.
