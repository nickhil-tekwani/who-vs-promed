The island-wide rabies vaccination program is slowly gaining ground, but much still needs to be done to stop the spread of rabies across Bali. The Denpasar Veterinary Agency has been studying both rabid and healthy dogs and the effectiveness of the vaccination program. Agency head Ketut Diarmita confirmed that vaccination could protect 70 percent of the targeted dogs. However, not all areas are currently covered and data was incomplete.

"The results of the vaccination program will be different on paper and in the field. On paper, the vaccine may work effectively for about a year, but in the field, we found samples showing some dogs were only immune for 6 months," Diarmita said. "Dogs," he further said, "must receive the appropriate dosage, but officers in the field often find it difficult to inject dogs," he said adding that a booster program must be put in place. "The vaccination program must cover at least 80 percent of the island's dog population for it to be effective. However," Diarmita admitted, "many dogs were not being immunized."

According to Balai Besar Veteriner (BBV) 2012 data, the vaccine could increase a dog's immune system by around 60 percent, which was better than the previous year's boost of only 42 percent.

Previously, Bali Governor Made Mangku Pastika had ordered the Veterinary Agency to cull stray dogs to support the administration's efforts to end the rabies epidemic, which was in line with a regional bylaw on the eradication of rabies. Bylaw No. 15/2009 stipulates that dog owners must keep their pets at home and have them vaccinated regularly. Anyone in violation of the bylaw can be sentenced to a maximum 6 months in prison and a fine of IDR 50 million (USD 4187). However, in spite of the bylaw, many dogs continue to roam freely.

Since November 2008, 147 people have died after contracting rabies.

Meanwhile, animal rights groups and international organizations have petitioned the governor's policy. "Eliminating animals is not the solution," the petition reads.

According to the bylaw, only animals that showed obvious signs of the disease should be killed; however, a study by Dayan University's Husbandry School said the dogs were often poisoned. According to members of the Bullhead, a punk rock band from Katangese, who initiated the petition, this sort of procedure was extremely cruel. The band started the petition on http://change.org; the introduction reads: "Dear Mr. governor, do not eliminate stray dogs as you want." As of Thursday morning [3 Jul 2014] the petition had 1300 signatures.

The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations has questioned the Bali administration's policy to cull stray dogs in an attempt to curb rabies on the island, a senior official admitted.

The provincial husbandry agency head, I Putu Sumantra, told Bali Daily on Monday [30 Jun 2014] that he had been contacted by a FAO official from the Sri Lanka office. "They questioned and protested our policy of culling stray dogs," Sumantra said. Sumantra hesitated to give more details. However, he said that FAO had contacted him after reading about the new policy in several media, including The Jakarta Post.

As reported previously, Bali Governor Made Mangku Pastika has stated that any stray dogs must be killed immediately to prevent people from being bitten. During a meeting at the governor's office on Thursday last week [26 Jun 2014], Pastika said that the provincial Animal Husbandry Agency's rabies team must implement the 2009 rabies prevention bylaw firmly in an attempt to curb rabies on the island. "If any stray dogs are found, feel free to eliminate them. It has been stipulated in the bylaw that dog owners have to confine their pets at home," Pastika said at that time.

In April 2013, the FAO presented awards to Bali's provincial administration for its successful efforts in preventing and mitigating rabies on the island.

Sumantra said he had explained to the FAO the reason for culling stray dogs. "I explained that we will only cull stray dogs, as they have caused rabies to rise in Bali again," he said. Sumantra said that the administration had been forced into making the policy after attempts to reduce rabies had stalled.

Rabies 1st broke out on the island in November 2008, and to date [4 Jul 2014] 147 people have died from the disease. Cases of rabies in humans have decreased continuously since 2010, with 4 deaths in 2008, 28 in 2009, 82 in 2010, 23 in 2011, 8 in 2012, 1 in 2013 and 1 in 2014.

Sumantra stated that the agency had found around 50 rabies-infected dogs during the January-June period this year [2014]. The dogs were found across the island, with the exception of Badung.

The uncontrolled population of stray dogs is allegedly leading to the increasing number of rabid dogs. The agency predicted that the stray dog population would increase from approximately 325 000 dogs last year [2013], to around 450 000 to 500 000 stray dogs this year [2014].

Sumantra said that 4th mass vaccination program was currently underway, targeting around 325 000 dogs. "But during the vaccination drive, our team realized there were more than 450 000 dogs now, as many stray dogs have been breeding. There are no longer enough vaccinations to curb rabies," he stated.

Enacted in 2009, the rabies prevention bylaw stipulates that dog owners have to keep their pets at home and have them vaccinated regularly. Anyone in violation of the bylaw faces a maximum of 6 months in jail or a fine of IDR 50 million (USD 4170). However, many dog owners are still unaware of the bylaw and let their dogs roam free. This had also resulted in a high cost for rabies prevention.

The epidemic led the Bali administration to provide free vaccines for dogs and affected humans.

[Our thanks to Lisa for these 2 very informative reports. Clearly, lessons are going to be learned as the Balinese control and eradication program continues. We cannot but agree with FAO in this matter, as stray dog elimination tactics merely antagonise the dog owning population and render vaccination less effective without community support. - Mod.MHJ
