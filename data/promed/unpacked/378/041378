The Los Angeles County Veterinary Public Health & Rabies Control
Program has identified an outbreak of distemper in wild raccoon
populations across Los Angeles County. Although none of the cases have
been identified in Long Beach, clusters of cases have been identified
in several areas across the county, including San Gabriel mountain
foothill communities, Rancho Palos Verdes communities and nearby Seal
Beach.

The distemper outbreak has also spread to other species, including
dogs, coyotes, foxes and skunks. Due to the close proximity of the
cases, Long Beach residents are advised to be vigilant for signs of
distemper in their pet dogs.

Long Beach residents are advised to report any suspected signs of
distemper in family pets to their personal veterinarian.

[Canine distemper is a viral disease that infects foxes, coyotes,
skunks, raccoons and unvaccinated dogs and other carnivores.

Clinical signs of distemper include discharge from the nose and eyes,
a rough coat of hair, often an emaciated appearance, and
disorientation or wandering aimlessly. The clinical signs become
progressively worse as the disease is usually fatal.

There is a neurological component to the disease. Animals may tremble,
convulse or display what is referred to as "chewing gum fits." The
animal appears to be smacking its lips and chewing gum. The animal may
turn, circle or even bend its body so that this "chewing" appears to
be directed at a flank. These neurological clinical signs can mimic
rabies. Although distemper virus poses no threat to human beings,
because the signs can appear similar to rabies, it is appropriate to
contact a physician immediately. Distemper and rabies can only be
distinguished by examining the animal's brain.

Transmission of the canine distemper virus (CDV) requires close
contact, as the virus does not survive long outside of the body. A
healthy animal (dog, raccoon, etc.) may contract canine distemper from
direct contact with an infected animal or its bodily fluids and waste.
Once an animal is infected with CDV, it begins to shed the virus
approximately 5 days later. CDV seems to always be present in the
environment. An animal may continue to shed the virus until its death,
which may take as long as 6 weeks; usually, the course of the disease
is much shorter.

Young animals are most susceptible to the disease. Consequently, we
see the disease manifest more in the spring and summer when young
animals are more obvious. Not all raccoons get the disease. However,
those that do are capable of passing it to other animals, including
our domestic animals. It is strongly recommended that people vaccinate
their dogs against this disease. There is prevention (vaccination) but
there is no good treatment.

CDV tends to move in 5-7 year cycles. This may be the beginning of a
cycle, and residents are again reminded to vaccine their pets. - Mod.TG]

For those interested in exotica, 1000 lions in Tanzania died from
distemper caught from dogs in 1994 -- see ProMED archive Lions, fatal
