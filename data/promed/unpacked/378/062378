Child deaths at BRD Medical College in Gorakhpur have come back to haunt the Uttar Pradesh government 3 months after a similar incident created a national uproar. BRD Hospital's head of department of community medicine Dr DK Srivastava said 30 children died within 48 hours. However, he said, the deaths did not take place due to lack of oxygen like last time.

"Out of the 30, 15 children were younger than one month. If children younger than one month are not treated urgently, their mortality rate increases. [In this instance] 6 kids died due to encephalitis, while the others died due to various reasons," Srivastava was quoted as saying by ANI.

Encephalitis is the swelling in the brain that leads to sudden high fever, headache, neck stiffness, disorientation, coma, seizures, spastic paralysis and, finally, death.

In August [2017], over 70 children died in a span of 5 days and the incident grabbed national attention after reports said the hospital faced a shortage of oxygen supply at that time. Although the state government had denied the reports, the then college principal, the in-charge of the neo-natal ward as well as clerks and the pharmacist were sacked for negligence. An FIR [First Information Report] was lodged against them, as well as the supplier of liquid oxygen to the hospital.

[Although cases of encephalitis in children in this area of Uttar Pradesh are not unusual, with Japanese encephalitis virus infections responsible for some, the above report does not indicate the etiological agent responsible for these 6 encephalitis cases. The ages of the encephalitis cases are not given so one cannot tell if they are among the 15 younger than one month. There is no etiology offered for any of these cases.

Previous reports indicate that JE is a minor cause of encephalitis in northeastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar states. The determination of the etiology or etiologies of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) has been confusing and elusive. AES has continued to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_), and lychee fruit consumption. Recently, scrub typhus has been implicated in many AES cases but is very unlikely for infants less than one month of age.
