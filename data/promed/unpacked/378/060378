After more than 80 pigs died in south Mizoram's Lunglei district over the last 2 weeks, the cause of their death has been suspected to be African swine fever (ASF). The 1st death was reported on 21 Mar 2021, according to officials, after which veterinary officers were sent to the district to ascertain the cause. The confirmatory test for ASF is yet to be done at the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD) in Madhya Pradesh, but the deaths have triggered fears in the state government which has already sounded alert for the disease.
