An outbreak of mumps in northern Manitoba is declining, but infection rates are still abnormally high.

The rate of reported infections in the region declined in September [2017] after 3 consecutive months when nearly 100 new cases were reported. "For September, it looked like we had 62 cases in the north, which was down from 97 in August [2017]," said Dr Michael Isaac, chief medical officer for the Northern Health Region (NHR).

In June, 98 cases of mumps were reported in the region, with another 94 reported in July [2017]. Typically, between 0 and 5 cases are reported to NHR in a year....

The mumps virus has had a resurgence throughout Manitoba in the past year, with more than 1000 cases being reported in the province since January [2017]. Isaac said the outbreak began in Winnipeg last spring, gradually spreading to other communities from there. Cases have been found among all age groups. The illness is highly contagious and can be spread for as long as 3 weeks during the period of infection.

Symptoms of the disease include headaches, muscle aches, fever and swollen glands around the neck, jaw and chin. Isaac also said the rate of complications arising from mumps cases has decreased during the outbreak, adding that few cases of severe side effects have been reported.

Despite the high number of cases, the NHR reports that northern Manitoba has a higher than average rate of people vaccinated for mumps. Cases of mumps have been reported in people who have previously been vaccinated for the illness.

Isaac said the mumps vaccine, like other immunizations, becomes less effective over time. "There's no doubt that the length of time after you've had your vaccine can play a part in your immunity. It looks like, for example, people who were vaccinated 25, 30 years ago are likely less [immune] than people who were vaccinated last year," he said.

Smaller, tight-knit communities are more susceptible to highly contagious illnesses like mumps. "Once you get a case or 2 in the community, because of that, the spread of the virus is greater," said Isaac. "I think the other thing that we have to take into account is, depending on the community, some communities have very high rates of overcrowding in housing stock. Where there's overcrowding - and it's not only mumps, it can be other things like tuberculosis and bacterial infections - there tends to be easier transmission in those environments. I think those 2 things, from a northern perspective, might explain some of the higher numbers we've been seeing."

Cases of the mumps are on the rise in Anchorage, according to a health bulletin put out by the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services. The state has identified 62 cases of confirmed, probable and suspected mumps, according to the bulletin. Most live in Anchorage or spent time there. It's the 1st outbreak in 5 years, according to the state health and social services website.

Mumps is a viral illness that typically starts with several days of fever, headache, muscle aches, fatigue, loss of appetite and swollen salivary glands, the bulletin said. The best way to prevent mumps infection is through vaccination with a measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, commonly known as the MMR. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is encouraging people in high-risk groups to get at least 3 doses of the MMR vaccine.

Groups at the most risk for contracting mumps include people who participate in a group setting, such as a daycare, work or church, where mumps is circulating, or Anchorage residents who are Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander.

["As of [Wed 15 Nov 2017], 44 confirmed, 12 probable, and 6 suspect cases [updated numbers above] were identified (see figure at URL below). All 56 confirmed and probable cases were residents of or spent extensive time in Anchorage. Among the 44 confirmed patients, the median age was 24 years (range: 10-68), and 13 (29 per cent) were aged 18 years or over; 36 (82 per cent) self-identified as Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander (NH/PI), 3 (7 per cent) as white, one (2 per cent) as black, and 4 (9 per cent) were of unknown race; and 20 (45 per cent) were female. Two patients have been hospitalized; none have died. Of the 22 (50 per cent) confirmed patients whose vaccination status was known one had 4 doses of MMR, one had 3 doses, 17 had 2 doses, and 3 had one dose. Among patients with 2 or more doses of MMR, the median time from the most recent dose to illness onset was 12 years (range: 4-20 years).

"Discussion
To date, this mumps outbreak has disproportionately impacted NH/PI people, who comprise 82 per cent of confirmed cases. For most patients, their infection was epidemiologically linked to a household or a congregate setting (such as work or church) where a case of mumps had been previously identified. While the original source of the outbreak is uncertain, several of the initial patients reported recent travel to or close contact with a person who had recently traveled to a Pacific island where mumps is circulating. Controlling a mumps outbreak requires high levels of herd immunity by vaccination. Because the vaccine is not 100 percent effective, however, many cases occur in fully-vaccinated patients during mumps outbreaks. In the current outbreak, 43 percent of patients had at least 2 doses of MMR. Moreover, waning immunity to the mumps component of the MMR vaccine contributes to mumps transmission. In this outbreak, a median of 12 years passed since receiving a 2nd dose among patients who had received 2 doses of MMR.

"On [Wed 25 Oct 2017], ACIP recommended that persons previously vaccinated with 2 doses of MMR who are identified by public health as being at high-risk for mumps during an outbreak should receive a 3rd dose of MMR. Based on this ACIP recommendation and the pattern of disease in the Anchorage outbreak, a 3rd dose of MMR is advisable for certain people . These recommendations may be updated as the outbreak evolves."

There is another mumps outbreak at a Rio Grande Valley jail [in the southernmost tip of South Texas]. The Texas Department of Criminal Justice told Channel 5 News one offender at the state facility in Willacy County is confirmed to have the disease. The 47 other offenders in the dormitory, where the inmate was housed, are now on medical restriction.

The infected person is in isolation.

Mumps is contagious for 5 --7 days before symptoms show and up to 10 days after. If no other offenders show symptoms, the medical restriction will be lifted [Wed 22 Nov 2017.]
