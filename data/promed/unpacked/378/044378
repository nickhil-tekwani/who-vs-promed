The CDC has confirmed a person with eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in Elkhart County has died from the disease.

This is the 1st human case in Indiana since 1998, and only the 4th reported since 1964.

Typically only 5 to 10 human cases of EEE are reported nationwide each year. But Michigan has had 10 cases this year [2019] alone; 4 of those have been deadly.

It's important to remember these cases are still considered rare. However, nearly 1/3 of the human cases are fatal.

Anyone who thinks they may have EEE should see a healthcare provider.

The following release was issued Saturday night [12 Oct 2019] by the Indiana State Department of Health:
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed to Indiana health officials that a Hoosier [Indiana resident] in Elkhart County contracted eastern equine encephalitis, or EEE, a rare virus transmitted by mosquitoes. The patient died as a result of the infection.

This is the 1st human case in Indiana since 1998 and only the 4th reported since 1964. The CDC says approximately 5 to 10 human cases of EEE are reported nationwide each year, typically from late spring through early fall. Nearly 1/3 of human cases are fatal.

"It's hard to imagine losing a loved one because of a mosquito bite, but unfortunately, mosquitoes carry diseases that can be life-threatening," said State Health Commissioner Kris Box, MD, FACOG "This is a tragic loss for an Indiana family."

EEE has been found in more than a dozen horses and one mosquito sample in northern Indiana this year [2019]. Although mosquito activity decreases with cooler temperatures, the risk of mosquito-borne diseases will not be eliminated until the 1st hard freeze occurs. State health officials urge Hoosiers to continue to take steps to prevent mosquito bites until then:

Avoid being outdoors when mosquitoes are active (especially late afternoon, dusk to dawn and early morning)

Use an EPA-registered insect repellent containing DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus or para-menthane-diol on clothes and exposed skin

Cover exposed skin by wearing a hat, long sleeves and long pants in places where mosquitoes are especially active, such as wooded areas

Install or repair screens on windows and doors to keep mosquitoes out of your home

Hoosiers also are encouraged to eliminate mosquito breeding sites by doing the following:
- discard old tires, tin/aluminum cans, ceramic pots or other containers that can hold water;
- repair failed septic systems;
- drill holes in the bottom of recycling containers left outdoors [to eliminate water accumulation];
- keep grass cut short and shrubbery trimmed;
- clean clogged roof gutters, particularly if leaves tend to plug up the drains;
- frequently replace the water in pet bowls;
- flush ornamental fountains and birdbaths periodically;
- aerate ornamental pools or stock them with predatory fish.

Symptoms of EEE virus disease include chills, fever, body aches, and joint pain. Some people develop a more severe form of the disease that affects the nervous system and causes encephalitis (inflammation of the brain). People who are younger than 15 years and older than 50 years are at the greatest risk of severe disease if infected with EEE virus. People who think they may have EEE virus disease should see a healthcare provider.

[Although human cases of EEE were mentioned in a 30 Sep 2019 post (Eastern equine encephalitis - North America (29): USA (MI,IN,CT) horse, human 20191004.6708752), they were historical and national, not related to this 1st human case of the 2019 year in Indiana. That earlier report did mention equine cases, a clear indication that EEE virus was actively circulating in the state. Indiana residents would be wise to carry out the measures for prevention of EEE infections by reduction of the breeding sites of vector mosquitoes around their homes and to avoid mosquito bites. Horse owners should vaccinate their animals, as should home owners and horse owners in the many states that have had EEE cases in eastern and central USA. - Mod.TY
