[As stated above, this now brings the total number of laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV infected individuals reported by Saudi Arabia since June 2012 to 773, including 329 deaths (case fatality rate 42.6 per cent). This case occurred in Riyadh where 7 other cases have been reported since 1 Sep 2014. According to the information available, the only possible risk factor for exposure is that this individual has a history of pre-existing co-morbidities, so there is possible exposure when in the healthcare setting for other reasons.

[2] Qatar, 1 new case - Supreme Council of Health

The Supreme Council of Health (SCH) has announced that a new Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) case has been reported for a Qatari patient aged 43 years old. The patient has had fever for a few days and was transported by ambulance to the Emergency Department at Hamad General Hospital. Upon assessment and laboratory investigations, the patient was diagnosed with pneumonia and subsequently confirmed as a MERS-CoV case.

As soon as the Health Protection Rapid Response Team got the notification, a series of standard investigation and contact tracing steps were implemented. These include verifying whether contacts have any symptoms and collecting specimens. All contacts will be monitored for 2 weeks. Within the same framework, a joint team from Human Health and Animal Resources started an investigation involving camels and individuals in contact with them for specimen collection and follow up.

Medical follow up reports indicated that the previous case diagnosed with MERS-CoV is improving and now is stable. He is still under standardized infection prevention and control measures. In addition, all of his contacts tested negative for MERS-CoV, and none have developed any similar symptoms so far.

SCH has alerted all healthcare providers in the country to stay alerted and report any suspected case and is urging all healthcare workers to strictly abide by infection prevention and control measures. SCH will continue to stress the importance of epidemiological surveillance, case management and isolation with infection prevention and control, and health education on preventive measures recommended so far.

SCH urges all citizens to follow recommended infection prevention and control measures, such as keeping away from camels and not visiting farms and camel barns, especially those with weak immune systems. Visitors to farms or camel barns should comply with standard personal hygiene and hand washing before and after handling camels, staying away from sick animals.

[This is the the 2nd case reported by Qatar since November 2013 and the 9th case of laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV infection, including 4 deaths reported by Qatar since 2012. The previously reported case was on 12 Oct 2014 in a 77 year old man who was visiting Saudi Arabia when he became symptomatic. It was unclear at the time whether the individual's exposure occurred in Qatar prior to travel to Saudi Arabia, or whether it occurred in Saudi Arabia (see MERS-CoV (34): Qatar, Saudi Arabia, new case, RFI 20141012.2856064). From the details provided in the Supreme Council of Health Statement above, the current case was not a known contact of the case confirmed earlier this month, October 2014, (all contacts of the earlier case have tested negative for MERS-CoV). Information on possible high risk exposures to camels, possible travel history or history of pre-existing co-morbidities are not presently available.

More information on results of investigations into possible high risk exposures of both this currently reported case as well as the earlier case reported on 12 Oct 2014 would be greatly appreciated.
