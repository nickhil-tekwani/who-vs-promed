Manila: Philippine health officials on Friday [20 Sep 2019] confirmed a 2nd case of polio in a 5-year-old child a day after declaring the country's 1st outbreak in nearly 2 decades and announced plans for a massive immunisation programme.

Health secretary Francisco Duque III said authorities confirmed the new case in a boy from Laguna province south of Manila after samples were found positive for the polio virus. Health officials declared a new outbreak on Thursday [19 Sep 2019] after confirming the disease in a 3-year-old girl in southern Lanao del Sur province.

They said the polio virus has also been detected in sewage in Manila and in waterways in the southern Davao region, prompting plans for an immunisation drive starting next month [October 2019] that is likely to include 10s of thousands of children under age 5.

At least 95% of children that age need to be vaccinated to halt the spread of polio in the Philippines, according to the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund, which expressed deep concern over the disease's reemergence in the country and pledged to support the government in immunising children and strengthening surveillance.

The boy afflicted with polio in Laguna experienced the onset of paralysis late last month [August 2019] but has been discharged from a hospital, is able to walk, and is being closely monitored for residual symptoms, health officials said.

Polio is a highly infectious viral disease that mainly afflicts young children. There is no known cure, and polio can only be prevented by immunisation, according to WHO. "We continue to urge parents and caregivers of children below 5 years old, health workers, and local chief executives to take part in the synchronised polio vaccination to be scheduled in their communities," said Duque, who administered polio vaccine to a child [in] a suburban Quezon city.

The government's immunisation programs were marred in 2017 by a dengue fever vaccine made by French drugmaker Sanofi Pasteur, which some Philippine officials linked to the deaths of at least 3 children.

Duque and other Philippine health officials say many parents became scared about immunisations, but they have worked to restore public trust in vaccines since then. The government halted the dengue immunisation drive after Sanofi said a study showed the vaccine may increase the risk of severe dengue infections.

More than 830 000 children received the Dengvaxia vaccine under the campaign, which was launched in 2016 and halted in 2017. Sanofi officials said the Dengvaxia vaccine was safe and would reduce dengue infections if the vaccination drive continued.

WHO and UNICEF official media release
Date: Thu 19 Sep 2019
Source: WHO and UNICEF joint news release [edited]
https://www.who.int/philippines/news/detail/19-09-2019-who-unicef-and-partners-support-philippine-department-of-health-s-polio-outbreak-response


The Philippine Department of Health (DOH) today [Thu 19 Sep 2019] announced an outbreak of polio in the country. A poliovirus case was confirmed on [16 Sep 2019] in a 3-year-old girl from Lanao del Sur. In addition, environmental samples from sewage in Manila and waterways in Davao were confirmed to contain the virus.

"We are very concerned that polioviruses are now circulating in Manila, Davao, and Lanao del Sur," said World Health Organization (WHO) representative in the Philippines Dr Rabindra Abeyasinghe. "WHO and UNICEF are working closely with the Department of Health to strengthen surveillance and swiftly respond to this outbreak. We urge all parents and caregivers of children under 5 years of age to have them vaccinated so that they are protected against polio for life."

"It is deeply disconcerting that poliovirus has re-emerged in the Philippines after nearly 2 decades. The outbreak calls for urgent action to protect more children from being infected. It reminds us of the importance of increasing immunization coverage to 95% of children to stop polio virus transmission in the Philippines. Vaccination is the only and best protection against polio that mainly affects children under 5 years of age. As long as one single child remains infected, children across the country and even beyond are at risk of contracting polio," said Oyun Dendevnorov, UNICEF Philippines representative. "UNICEF is working with Department of Health and WHO to accelerate actions for the health and safety of children in the Philippines, especially in the affected regions."

Polio outbreak response
Prior to the declaration of the outbreak, the Department of Health and its partners launched a polio immunization campaign in the city of Manila. Further mass polio immunization rounds will be rolled out from October 2019.

The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) is supporting the Philippine government's response, providing technical advice, on-the-ground monitoring, and risk communication. The GPEI is a public-private partnership led by national governments with 5 partners: WHO, Rotary International, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), UNICEF, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Its goal is to eradicate polio worldwide.

Local government action and advice to parents and caregivers
WHO and UNICEF urge local governments to ensure that vaccination campaigns are planned and implemented effectively. Every community leader, religious leader, and celebrity must mobilize their communities to participate in immunization activities.

Parents and caregivers are advised that the best protection for their children is vaccination. It takes multiple doses of polio vaccine to achieve full immunity against polio.

WHO and UNICEF also remind families to wash their hands regularly with soap and water, use a toilet, consume food that is fully cooked, and drink safe water. If the safety of your water is in doubt, boil it, ensuring it is bubbling vigorously for at least one minute before allowing it to cool.

Oral polio vaccine
The oral polio vaccine (OPV) is a safe and effective vaccine that has saved millions of lives over the years. More than 18 million people are able to walk today who would otherwise have been paralyzed, and 1.5 million childhood deaths have been averted thanks to the polio vaccine. Since the introduction of the polio vaccine in 1988, cases have decreased by over 99%.

OPV contains an attenuated (weakened) form of the virus, activating an immune response in the body. When a child is immunized with OPV, the weakened virus replicates in the intestine for a limited period, thereby developing immunity by building up antibodies. During this time, the virus is also excreted in their faeces. In areas where there is inadequate sanitation and hygiene, the excreted weakened virus can spread in the immediate community before eventually dying out.

If a population is not sufficiently immunized, the weakened virus can continue to circulate. The longer it is allowed to survive, the more changes it undergoes. In rare instances, the virus can change to a vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV), a form that has regained the ability to cause paralysis.

The polio outbreak in the Philippines is confirmed to be from a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 [cVDPV2]. This is of particular concern, as wild poliovirus type 2 was certified as globally eradicated in 2015. Poorly conducted immunization activities, when too few children have received the required 3 doses of polio vaccine, leave them susceptible to poliovirus, either from vaccine-derived or wild polioviruses. Full immunization protects them from both forms of the virus.

Philippines declared polio-free in 2000
The last known case of wild poliovirus recorded in the Philippines was in 1993. The country was declared wild polio-free in 2000 along with the rest of WHO's Western Pacific Region.

Vaccination coverage in the Philippines has been steadily declining over the past few years. To stop the spread of polio in the Philippines, at least 95% of children under 5 years of age need to be vaccinated.

Lay press report

https://www.rappler.com/nation/240493-polio-back-philippines


The Department of Health (DOH) on Thursday [19 Sep 2019] declared a polio epidemic after it recorded a case of the disease in Lanao del Sur. This is the country's 1st confirmed case after 19 years of being polio-free.

The DOH said it found the disease in a 3-year-old girl who is "now apparently well but with residual paralysis." The case was confirmed on Saturday [14 Sep 2019].

"The result of [the girl's stool exam showed vaccine-derive poliovirus (VDPV) type 2, and the child was unvaccinated against polio," DOH Epidemiology Bureau director Ferchito Avelino said.

The DOH said it is waiting for another case to be confirmed, adding that they would make an announcement once it is confirmed.

Health secretary Francisco Duque III told media on Thursday [19 Sep 2019] the DOH declared an "epidemic" or "outbreak" after they found one positive case of the disease in Lanao del Sur and after environmental samples from Manila and Davao tested positive for poliovirus, as these are "considered an epidemic in a polio-free country."

The country was declared polio-free since October 2000, with the last case of poliovirus reported in 1993.

The DOH said it found type 1 poliovirus in Manila and type 2 in Davao. There is another type of poliovirus, type 3. Their main difference is the makeup of the outer, protective coating called the capsid.

According to Rotary International, an organization that has been conducting anti-polio initiatives for 30 years, type 1 poliovirus is the known cause of the few cases of the disease existing in the world today. Type 2 poliovirus, meanwhile, was declared eradicated in September 2015, with the last virus detected in India in 1999.

The DOH sees low vaccination coverage, poor early surveillance of polio symptoms, and substandard sanitation practices as culprits in this reemergence. The DOH had earlier said that the Philippines was at "high risk" of poliovirus transmission after Manila's sewage showed 2 samples that tested positive for poliovirus.

Polio, or poliomyelitis, is a highly contagious disease caused by poliovirus invading the nervous system. Symptoms include fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, stiff neck, and sudden onset of floppy arms or legs. In severe cases, it can lead to permanent paralysis or even death. Children under 5 years of age are most vulnerable to the disease.

Vaccination, cleanliness are key
The health department found that polio vaccination for children below 5 years old dropped to less than 95% in 2018. Health secretary Duque said the average national polio vaccination stands at about 66-68%. "We need to bring this up to 95% level to ensure herd immunity," he said. "We strongly urge parents, health workers, and local governments to fully participate in the synchronized polio vaccination."

The DOH on 19 Aug [2019] launched its "Sabayang Patak kontra Polio" campaign in the city of Manila, where the poliovirus sample was found. On Friday [20 Sep 2019], Rotary Philippines will launch an NCR-wide polio vaccination campaign, beginning in Quezon City.

The health department will expand the vaccination campaign to other Metro Manila cities on 1 Oct [2019], with a target of 1 276 658 children below 5 years old for its 2nd round. The vaccination campaign will also kick off in Davao and Lanao del Sur in October [2019].

The 3rd round will be conducted in Central Luzon (Region III) and Calabarzon (Region IV-A) from [19-30 Nov 2019], targeting 4 090 228 children under 5 years of age.

The DOH had earlier said that the main challenge confronting the agency in its conduct of door-to-door vaccination was the fact that children and guardians are usually not around when they make the rounds.

In a survey covering 370 households in the city of Manila, the DOH found that 153 kids were not vaccinated because they were not in their homes during the campaign. Meanwhile, 8 kids had their guardians around but refused vaccination due to vaccine hesitancy.

The DOH assured the public that aside from door-to-door initiatives, it would deploy resources in health centers nationwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) is working closely with the DOH in its anti-polio response. "Even if children had already been vaccinated, they need these additional doses to be fully protected," said WHO country representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe.

The vaccination schedule for preventing polio, as recommended by the (WHO), involves 3 doses of oral polio vaccine (OPV) and one dose of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). It is the OPV that contains live, weakened virus that may cause VDPV.

The health department also urges local governments to intensify their Zero Open Defecation program and calls for proper sanitation practices, like regularly washing one's hands.

[On 1 Sep 2019, there was a media report announcing a VDPV isolate from sewage sampling in Manila, but without mention of serotype of the virus identified (see Poliomyelitis update (72): Afghanistan (OZ) Philippines (MM) VDPV environmental 20190903.6655037). At that time there were no associated AFP (acute flaccid paralysis) cases associated with the VDPV isolate. The lay press report above suggests there may be another AFP case being investigated as possibly due to the cVDPV: "The DOH said it is waiting for another case to be confirmed, adding that they would make an announcement once it is confirmed." There is also a suggestion that AFP surveillance may be suboptimal: "The DOH sees low vaccination coverage, poor early surveillance of polio symptoms, and substandard sanitation practices as culprits in this reemergence."

Another curiosity raised in the lay press report is mention that cVDPV1 had been identified in Manila environmental samples, but that cVDPV2 was isolated in the 3-year-old child in Lanao del Sur. If so, there would appear to be more than one outbreak simultaneously ongoing. We await further clarification. Note the addition of the 1st media report announcing confirmation of a 2nd case, this one in Laguna province, which is on Luzon Island, south of Manila and the Metro Area. The serotype of this newly confirmed case is still pending.

It should be mentioned here that a contributing factor influencing the vaccine hesitancy movement in the Philippines is the recent experience with the new dengue vaccine, leading to serious disease among vaccinees (children) that had never been exposed to the dengue virus prior to vaccination. (see Dengue/DHF update (18): Philippines halted, Brazil modified vaccination program 20171206.5485739).

A map of the Philippines showing provinces can be found at http://mapsof.net/philippines/philippines-regions-and-provinces. The province of Lanao del Sur is located in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Mindanao. Davao is a province on Mindinao to the east of Lanao del Sur, and Manila is located in Central Luzon, significantly north of Mindinao. As mentioned previously, it is significantly noteworthy that Metro Manila is one of the most densely populated areas in the world.

[Noteworthy information is contained in the summary on poliovirus isolates contained at the beginning of each of the weekly reports. In this week's report, there is mention of AFP cases associated with cVDPVs in Angola (7 cases), Philippines (1 case), and Nigeria (1 case). Positive environmental samples for WPV1 were found in Afghanistan (6 samples).

Note that the summary of reported cases at the end of this weekly update does not as yet count the case reported by the Philippines this week, so the total reported cVDPV cases during 2019 will read 81 cases.

As done in previous posts, to visualize all of this activity, I am putting links to HealthMap/ProMED-mail maps of countries with poliovirus activity during the past 12 months below. The size of the list remains impressive, now with 20 countries: 12 in Africa, 5 in Asia, and 3 in the Western Pacific.

[6] Pakistan (Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) - media report
Date: Mon 9 Sep 2019
Source: Dawn [edited]
https://www.dawn.com/news/1504376


The daughter of an Afghan national in Karachi and the grandson of a South Waziristan resident, known for his strong opposition to polio vaccine, are the latest victims of the deadly virus, it emerged on [Sun 8 Sep 2019].

Both the children are yet to see their 1st birthdays. With the addition of these cases -- one each from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa [KP] and Sindh -- this year's [2019] total number of victims of the crippling disease has reached 62, the highest since 2015.

A total of 12 cases were reported in 2018, while only 8 children had been tested positive for the virus in 2017.

About the latest case from KP, an official of the polio virology laboratory at the National Institute of Health (NIH), Islamabad, requesting anonymity said: "It was a clear case of refusal." The victim was a 10-month-old boy. The case was detected in South Waziristan. "The child's grandfather was against polio vaccine," the official explained, adding that his father was said to be a labourer in Dubai.

About the latest case reported from Sindh, the official said an 8-month-old girl was found infected with the virus in Karachi's Orangi area. "The child, whose father is an Afghan national, is resident of Sector F-11, UC-1, Orangi Town, district Karachi West. The child was all right before she developed a high-grade fever, followed by weakness in both lower limbs, on [20 Aug 2019]. According to her mother, they took her to Dr. Mohammad Yar at Shoaib Medical Center where she got medication. The doctor had notified the child as a carrier of polio virus on [24 Aug 2019]. But as incubation time of the virus is almost 3 weeks, it has been finally confirmed that the child was paralysed due to polio virus," he added.

A spokesperson for the emergency operation centre for polio in Sindh said the child had routine dose of polio. He said they were investigating by which manner she had received doses during polio campaigns. He said the child was low on immunity. "This is why repeated vaccination of oral polio vaccine is necessary."

Another official said the child's EPI [Expanded Program on Immunization] card, carrying details of vaccinations, revealed she had defaulted Penta-II vaccine [2nd dose of vaccine against 5 diseases: diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough), tetanus, hepatitis B, and _Haemophilus influenzae_ type B (Hib)]. The child was said to have no travel history, and her father possessing an Afghan national identity card was said to have been living in Karachi for years.

Of the 62 polio cases reported during the current year [2019], as many as 46 cases were detected in KP only. A total of 6 cases were found in Sindh, while Balochistan and Punjab reported 5 cases each.

According to the World Health Organisation's [WHO's] Technical Advisory Group (TAG) on Polio Eradication, KP is a major barrier to polio eradication efforts in Pakistan. It termed the situation caused by the parallel polio structure in the province "crises."

According to the advisory group's recommendations, a copy of which is available with Dawn, KP has been highlighted as the core reason behind the rise in polio cases in the country. The apex evaluation body stated: "KP Emergency Operations Centre [EOC] is not aligned with the federal EOC, as roles and responsibilities of KP EOC are unclear." TAG recommended a complete reset of KP's polio programme, observing that the provincial polio programme has failed to identify roles and responsibilities with "2 simultaneous but different strategic approaches being used with distant action plans."

As KP shares the major burden of the total number of cases reported during the year [2019] in the country, the advisory group acknowledged that Federally Administered Tribal Areas' (Fata) merger with KP and fake finger markings are major challenges, but observed that the communication strategies being used by the KP polio programme were "not fit for the purpose." There are only 2 countries in the world, Pakistan and Afghanistan, where polio cases are still reported. Pakistan remains under a polio-linked travel restriction imposed by the WHO due to which since 2014 every person travelling aboard has to carry a polio vaccination certificate.

Another 2 polio cases have been reported, one each from Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa [KP], taking the tally for the current year [2019] to 60.

An official of the Polio Virology Laboratory at the National Institute of Health (NIH), requesting anonymity, said that the case from Balochistan was reported from the Gulistan region of Qilla Abdullah district.

"The child who has been paralysed due to polio virus is a 17-month-old-boy, and not a single dose of vaccine was administered to him, as his uncle and grandfather were refusing on religious grounds," he said.

"Unfortunately, we have been facing severe resistance in the area, and in April this year [2019], 2 female polio workers were murdered there. We have been considering seeking support of the army to ensure vaccination in the area," he said.

He said that the 2nd case was reported from Lakki Marwat [Bannu division of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa] where a 5-month-old girl had been infected with the virus of the crippling disease.

"Investigation shows that it was also a case of refusal, as parents had kept markers at their home and used them to mark the fingers of the child on the 1st day of the polio campaign to show that the child was already vaccinated," he said.

The Prime Minister's focal person on polio eradication, Babar bin Atta, confirmed that 2 more polio cases were reported from Balochistan and KP.

Ministry of Public Health on Wednesday [11 Sep 2019] confirmed that a new polio case was found in the southern province of Uruzgan, increasing the number of children affected by the disease to 8.

The provincial public health department said in a statement that a 14-month-old [child] was afflicted to the disease and never received polio vaccination. The [child's] family lives in the provincial city of Tarinkot, an area under Taliban control.

Abdul Shakoor Nosrat, an official of the public health ministry, said that Uruzgan had the most figures of children suffering from polio. "The polio cases will increase if a house-to-house vaccination is not implemented."

Marjan Rasekh, head of ministry's media office, said that public teams still have problems to widen the vaccination program to the areas out of government control.

More than one million children have been deprived from receiving polio vaccines in the southern provinces due to security problems.

[The media reports contained in sections 5-8 above are included to provide more details on the newly confirmed cases of WPV1-associated polio reported during this period. A consistent theme in the increase of WPV1-associated cases in Afghanistan and Pakistan is the family refusal for vaccinations in the majority of the cases, or coming from an area with known insecurity for the vaccinators and other government officials. - Mod.MPP]

[9] Ghana, cVDPV2 - WHO Disease Outbreak News, 6 Sep 2019

Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 - Republic of Ghana

In Nigeria and West Africa, a cVDPV2 outbreak originating from Jigawa state, Nigeria, continues to spread. In Ghana, cVDPV2 was isolated from an acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) case in Ando-Nyamanu, Chereponi district, Northern Region, bordering Togo. The case was a 2-year old girl who had experienced onset of paralysis on [27 Jul 2019]. Stool samples were taken on [27 and 28 Jul 2019] and sent to the National Polio Laboratory at the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research for further laboratory investigations. The sample tested positive for cVDPV2 on [17 Aug 2019]. Sequencing of the sample from the AFP case revealed 25 nucleotide differences compared to the reference Sabin 2 and 6 nucleotides, with the closest sequencing match made with an AFP case originating from Jigsaw state, Nigeria, from 2018. Earlier, a related cVDPV2 strain had been isolated from an environmental sample, collected on [11 Jun 2019], from Northern Region in Ghana. Both isolated viruses were linked to an outbreak originating in Jigawa, Nigeria, in 2018. In the past, this same strain had spread within Nigeria, and internationally to the Republic of Niger, Benin, and Cameroon.

The last indigenous wild poliovirus was reported in 2000. This is the 1st ever reported cVDPV2 outbreak reported in the country.

Public health response
The Ministry of Health has declared detection of this virus to be a national public health emergency, in line with temporary recommendations issued by the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee regarding the international spread of poliovirus.

The Ministry of Health and its partners are working to urgently stop the outbreak and prevent further spread.

An emergency meeting with key stakeholders and partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) was held on 19 Aug 2019 to discuss response measures. In response to this, the Ministry of Health / Ghana Health Service has taken these immediate actions:

- A national team made up of the Ghana Health Service and the WHO has been deployed to support regional and district teams carrying out detailed investigations and response measures.
- A full epidemiological and field investigation is currently ongoing, with active surveillance efforts being strengthened, subnational population immunity levels being analyzed, and a comprehensive outbreak response being planned.
- At-risk areas have been mapped, and a reactive vaccination campaign has been planned in the affected and adjoining high-risk districts following approval from the Polio Advisory Group for monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2).

WHO risk assessment
Given cross-border population movements with Nigeria and across West Africa, as well as subnational immunity and surveillance gaps, West Africa is considered at high risk for further transmission and international spread of the isolated cVDPV2 across the region.

WHO advice
It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for AFP cases in order to rapidly detect any new virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories, and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.

WHO's International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than 4 weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of OPV or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) within 4 weeks to 12 months of travel.

As per the advice of the Emergency Committee convened under the International Health Regulations (2005), efforts to limit the international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Countries affected by poliovirus transmission is subject to Temporary Recommendations. To comply with the Temporary Recommendations issued under the PHEIC, any country infected by poliovirus should declare the outbreak as a national public health emergency and consider vaccination of all international travellers.

[This report provides details on the genetic origin of the isolated virus, confirming that the virus is closely related to those circulating in Jigawa, Nigeria, in 2018. Reading between the lines, it suggests that this virus may well have been circulating silently in Ghana since 2018, given its genetic relationship to a 2018 virus and not a more recent virus in Jigawa. - Mod.MPP]
