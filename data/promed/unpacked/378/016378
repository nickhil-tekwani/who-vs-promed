Dr. Frank Galey is the veterinary toxicologist involved in the botulism
outbreak at a dairy farm in California. I (Carol_meteyer@usgs.gov) forwarded
the posting from ProMED-mail and he gave the following response:

"To answer the question, the cat probably didn't do it (cause the mortality)
all by itself. The rotten material from the cat leaked into the bale of hay,
which in turn was reportedly rotten and wet. The thorough mixing of the hay
is probably what disseminated the toxin.

We didn't get the bot[ulinum toxin out of the cows themselves yet. We are
working on that part. Anyone who knows this disease in livestock is aware
that this (identifying the toxin in the cows) is very difficult, though
desirable. What we do have is classical clinical signs, a very well mixed
TMR [cattle ration, an amount of very rotten hay that is distributed
throughout the feed, and identification of bits of a carcass in the feed.
That does NOT mean the carcass alone had to be ingested. It is however a
good starting point to try to identify and type the source of the botulinum
toxin ... which we did; it was Type C toxin. We were extremely lucky, to
have even that. Often even a source for identification and typing of toxin
in a bovine botulism case is never found.

We are lucky to have collaboration from Pennsylvania as well as the USGS
laboratory in chasing this down now. I'll let you know if we get any more
information and thanks in advance for forwarding this to ProMED-mail.
