Spy's poisoning may have been earlier
-------------------------------------
A key witness in the radiation death of former Russian intelligence officer
Alexander Litvinenko claimed the poisoning took place earlier than is
generally believed, according to a newspaper interview published Wednesday
[13 Dec 2006]. Andrei Lugovoi, also a former Russian intelligence agent,
met with Litvinenko to discuss business at London's Millennium Mayfair
Hotel on 1 Nov 2006, a few hours before Litvinenko fell ill.
But Lugovoi said in an interview with the Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper
that he thinks Litvinenko may have been poisoned 2 weeks earlier, on the
day he and Lugovoi met another business associate, Dmitry Kovtun.
Litvinenko, 43, a former KGB agent and Kremlin critic, died 23 Nov 2006 in
London, and doctors said they found the rare radioactive element
polonium-210 in his body.
Lugovoi told the tabloid newspaper that he, Kovtun and Litvinenko met in
the office of a security company in London on 16 Oct 2006. He suggested
that they all could have been contaminated during Lugovoi and Kovtun's
mid-October 2006 visit to London.
After Litvinenko fell ill on 1 Nov 2006, Kovtun was found to have suffered
exposure to a radioactive substance. Lugovoi is also being checked for
radiation contamination.
British authorities, meanwhile, discovered traces of polonium-210 in the
security company offices.
"Who told you that the contamination took place on 1 Nov 2006? It took
place much earlier, on 16 Oct 2006," Lugovoi was quoted as saying by the
paper. Lugovoi is reportedly undergoing radiation checks in a Moscow clinic.
Kovtun also claimed in an interview with Germany's Spiegel TV that he must
have been contaminated during meetings with Litvinenko and Lugovoi in
London in mid-October 2006. Kovtun was present at the 1 Nov 2006 meeting
with Litvinenko and Lugovoi at the Millennium Mayfair Hotel. Litvinenko 1st
started feeling sick that evening. Later, tests showed 7 hotel employees
were exposed to polonium-210. The Russian Prosecutor General's office says
Kovtun has been diagnosed with radiation poisoning. He is reportedly being
treated in Russia.
Both Lugovoi and Kovtun have been questioned in Moscow by visiting Scotland
Yard investigators. They have denied involvement in Litvinenko's poisoning.
Meanwhile, German investigators are investigating Kovtun on suspicion that
he may have illegally handled radioactive material. German authorities have
found traces of polonium-210 in several locations visited by Kovtun before
he traveled to London on 1 Nov 2006.
They say Kovtun flew to Hamburg from Moscow on 28 Oct 2006 and departed for
London on 1 Nov 2006. Traces of polonium-210 have been found on the
passenger seat of the car that picked up Kovtun from the Hamburg airport.
German officials believe that Kovtun already was contaminated when he
arrived in Hamburg.

Two old friends at center of poison mystery
-------------------------------------------
At a closed hospital run by the Federal Medical-Biological Agency, 2
Russian men, friends since they were 12 year olds, lie removed from the
world and at the center of an international poisoning drama. Dmitry Kovtun
and Andrei Lugovoy, who visited with former Russian intelligence agent
Alexander Litvinenko the day he fell ill, have declared their innocence, as
the investigation narrows to this city and to at least one of the men, Kovtun.
Each discovery of a trace of polonium-210, the radioactive isotope that
killed Litvinenko, acts like a carelessly left fingerprint. British and
German investigators say a trail of positive readings matches the movements
of Kovtun from Moscow to Hamburg on 28 Oct 2006 and then on to London,
where he met with Litvinenko at the bar of the Millennium Hotel on 1 Nov 2006.
German police are investigating Kovtun as a suspect in illegal handling of
a radioactive substance. Russian prosecutors call him a victim and have
opened an attempted murder case on grounds that he was poisoned.

Four hospitalized in Germany in radiation inquiry
-------------------------------------------------
Police said 4 people in Germany were hospitalized Monday [11 Dec 2006]
after showing signs that they may be contaminated by polonium-210, the
poison that killed former Russian intelligence officer Alexander
Litvinenko. All 4 are connected to Dmitry Kovtun, a Russian businessman who
met Litvinenko in London the day he became ill. German police said they are
investigating Kovtun, 41, on suspicion that he illegally handled a
radioactive substance. They said he left a radioactive trail in Germany
after arriving there from Moscow on 28 Oct 2006 and before flying to London
on 1 Nov 2006. Litvinenko began feeling sick on 1 Nov 2006, so the
discovery of a trail of the deadly substance before that date is a
significant development, because it could lead police to its source.
Dmitry Kovtun met with ex-spy Alexander Litvinenko in London in October
2006, seen during an interview with Ekho Moskvy radio in Moscow in a 24 Nov
2006 file photo. Police said that traces of alpha radiation had been found
at the homes in and near Hamburg of the ex-wife and the former
mother-in-law of Dmitry Kovtun.
According to Russian news reports, Kovtun is now apparently ill in a
Russian hospital. But just as he emerges as a central figure in the case,
his whereabouts and condition have been shrouded in mystery. German
officials said Monday [11 Dec 2006] that they had no information on
Kovtun's "current location or his state of health."
Kovtun's 31 year old former wife, her 27 year old boyfriend and her 2
children, ages one and 3, were sent to a Hamburg hospital on Monday [11 Dec
2006] for further tests on "suspicion" of being contaminated, Hamburg
police said. German news reports said polonium-210 was found in the
bedrooms of the ex-wife's home, on the children and on the family's clothes.
German officials said Sunday [10 Dec 2006] that Kovtun spent the night of
28 Oct 2006 at his ex-wife's apartment and that they had found polonium-210
on the couch where he slept. They also said traces of polonium-210 were
found in a BMW that Kovtun rode in from the airport after flying in from
Moscow earlier that day. Officials said Monday [11 Dec 2006] that they had
found traces in a 2nd car, a Chrysler, which he rode in twice between 28
Oct and 1 Nov 2006. Police are also seeking to find the taxi driver who
drove Kovtun to the airport for a 0640 Germanwings flight to London on 1
Nov 2006.
In Moscow on Monday [11 Dec 2006], British detectives talked with
businessman and former KGB officer Andrei Lugovoy, who with Kovtun met
Litvinenko on 1 Nov 2006 at the Millennium Hotel in London. Seven employees
of the hotel's Pine Bar, where the Russians met, have tested positive for
traces of polonium-210. The bar remains closed.
Kovtun spoke with British and Russian investigators last week, and
afterward Russian officials said he had been found to be contaminated with
a radioactive substance. Russian news reports said he is believed to be in
the same Moscow hospital as Lugovoy, who is also being tested for radiation.
