[British Columbia (BC)] public health officials are renewing their call for men who have sex with men [MSM] to get tested for syphilis as 2013 figures show the number of cases has surpassed the 2012 rate, which was already the highest in decades.

"In 2012, syphilis rates in the Lower Mainland were at their highest in 30 years, and last year [2013] they were even higher. [The Lower Mainland is the region surrounding and including the city of Vancouver, BC, Canada, with 59 percent of BC's total population (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Mainland).] In 2013, 561 new cases were reported in BC and 86 per cent of those were diagnosed in Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH)," says Dr. Reka Gustafson, medical health officer with VCH. "We're encouraging men who have sex with men to become more aware about syphilis, practice safer sex, and to incorporate regular testing into their health care."

An awareness campaign has helped increase testing rates by 20 per cent in 2013 compared to the year before. More than 48 000 men were tested in Vancouver in 2013. A similar campaign was launched this summer [2014] to encourage more men to get tested. The campaign uses trending topics in social media to discuss the rising rates and includes posters and a webpage at http://www.checkhimout.ca/syphilis/.

"We're grateful to have partnerships with agencies that work directly with gay and bisexual men," says Chris Buchner, regional director of prevention, VCH. "With help from organizations including Qmunity, YouthCO, Health Initiative for Men (HIM), Positive Living BC, family doctors, and the BC Centre for Disease Control, we're hoping to engage people with a respectful and relevant message, and encourage them to test for syphilis regularly."

Syphilis is a highly contagious disease spread primarily by sexual activity -- whether it's oral, vaginal or anal sex. Just being in close contact with an infected person's genitals, mouth or rectum is enough to expose a person to infection.

In 2013, the majority of all diagnosed cases in VCH were picked up through blood testing many weeks after people showed initial symptoms, when the infection became latent with no symptoms. Common early symptoms of syphilis include painless ulcers or sores resembling bug bites on genitalia, rashes on the palms and soles, fever, swollen lymph glands and weight loss. If left untreated, these symptoms disappear and syphilis then enters an asymptomatic or latent stage, which can eventually lead to permanent blindness, hearing loss, deep bone pain and neurological problems. Severe cases of the disease can be fatal.

Pregnant women can also pass syphilis to an unborn child resulting in stillbirth, pre-term birth and abnormalities in the baby.

Syphilis also increases the risk of getting HIV; in fact, there are high rates of syphilis among people who are HIV positive. In VCH, 69 per cent of all syphilis cases are also HIV positive.

[The increase in the occurrence of syphilis in 2013 in British Columbia, Canada, is occurring mainly in the city of Vancouver and its environs, and, as the news article above reports, is in part due to enhanced case detection, but there is also likely a true increased incidence of syphilis.

The rates of early syphilis in Canada, as in the United States, have been increasing since about 2000. In Canada, the male-to-female rate ratio increased from 1.5:1.0 in 1999 to 6.4:1.0 in 2008, reflecting that more males than females were reported with early syphilis, and this disparity increased over time (http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/std-mts/report/sti-its2008/05-eng.php). In 2008, men accounted for 86.1 percent of reported cases. Between 1999 and 2008, the rate in men increased from 0.7 to 7.3 per 100 000 and in women increased from 0.5 to 1.1 per 100 000. In men, the highest reported rate of early syphilis was shared between 25-29 year olds and 30-39 year olds (13.3 per 100 000) (http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/std-mts/report/sti-its2008/05-eng.php). Together, these age groups accounted for almost 40 percent of reported cases in men in 2008. In women, the highest reported rate was in 20-24 year olds (3.6 per 100 000). In males, the greatest increase in reported rates of early syphilis between 1999 and 2008 was in 25-29 year olds.

In many countries (see prior ProMED-mail posts below), the increased incidence of syphilis is occurring mainly among men who have sex with men (MSM), and has been characterized by high rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection, high-risk sexual behavior, use of drugs such as methamphetamines, use of Internet chat rooms to meet sex partners (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5510a1.htm), and more recently, use of smartphone applications like Grindr, a gay social networking site. A discussion of the risk for acquisition of sexually transmitted diseases associated with use of the Internet, mobile phones and social networking sites can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/std/life-stages-populations/Adolescents-white-paper.pdf.

A recent article posted by ProMED-mail reported that HIV-infected gay men seek out other HIV-positive sex partners to avoid using condoms, but this situation allows transmission of syphilis, gonorrhea and other sexual transmitted diseases (Syphilis & gonococcal dis. - USA (04): (OR) rising incidence, MSM, HIV coinfect. 20140608.2527642). - Mod.ML
