DUSHANBE: A villager in the Khatlon region of Tajikistan has died of
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, the solitary tragic event of this kind in
the region. Local medics have been unable to trace any other people
[exhibiting the disease in the whole of the Khatlon region, including the
personnel of the hospital where the man died, his next of kin and other
people who had contact with the deceased. It was not immediately clear
where and how the victim had become infected. Sources in the Republic's
Public Health Service told ITAR-TASS that the situation was under control
in the village and in the region as a whole.
