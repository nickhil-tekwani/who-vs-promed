US official figures put the toll of H5N2 highly pathogenic avian influenza at 87 outbreaks in poultry, affecting more than 11 million birds.

The latest report from the USDA APHIS lists the following new outbreaks of avian flu in poultry:
- Minnesota, Stearns country: 26 900 commercial turkeys
- Iowa, Sioux county: 1.7 million commercial chickens
- Wisconsin, Barron country: 83 300 commercial turkeys
- Minnesota, Redwood county: commercial turkeys (number pending)
- Iowa, Sac county: 33 900 commercial turkeys
- North Dakota, LaMoure county: 71 500 commercial mixed poultry (turkeys and chickens)
- Wisconsin: Jefferson county: 1.03 million commercial chickens
- Minnesota, Kandiyohi county: 42 900 commercial turkeys
- Minnesota, Kandiyohi county: 67 000 commercial turkeys
- Minnesota, Kandiyohi county: 68 000 commercial turkeys

In each of these outbreaks, the cause has been confirmed as the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus of mixed Eurasian and American origin.

The North Dakota farm affected is in the area of the Central flyway for migrating birds; the other outbreaks are in the area of the Mississippi flyway.

According to Grand Forks Herald [North Dakota], the outbreaks have already so far killed about 1/5 of the turkey population in Minnesota, which is America's leading turkey-producing state.

Overview of high-path avian flu outbreaks in US poultry
-------------------------------------------------------
The following information is based on published USDA APHIS outbreak reports:
- The latest cases bring the total number of high-path avian flu outbreaks since December 2014 to 87.
- Outbreaks have occurred in poultry in 13 states.
- 3 of the early outbreaks were caused by the H5N8 sub-type of the virus but in all those since mid-February 2015, the H5N2 variant has been confirmed.
- The majority of outbreaks have been in commercial turkeys (67); 6 have been in commercial chickens, one in a mixed commercial flock and 12 in backyard flocks.
- The number of poultry affected by these outbreaks now exceeds 11.0 million. This figure includes more than 7.0 million commercial chickens, more than 3.9 million commercial turkeys and 7 173 backyard poultry.
- The disease has also affected 5 captive wild birds.

The bird flu has struck an egg-laying operation in Iowa owned by a prominent Minnesota businessman, and it could be the single largest casualty yet of the lethal virus sweeping the Upper Midwest poultry industry.

The Iowa Department of Agriculture said [Thu 30 Apr 2015] that there was an initial positive test at an egg-laying operation in northwestern Iowa with an estimated 5.5 million birds. Rembrandt Enterprises, one of the nation's largest egg producers, confirmed the operation is its Rembrandt, Iowa, facility.

Also on [Thu 30 Apr 2015], wildlife regulators announced that a hawk in western Minnesota is the state's 1st wild bird to test positive for the bird flu, adding more mystery to the virus' spread. And 3 more Minnesota turkey farms were reported stricken by the flu, bringing the number of afflicted farms to 70 and the number of bird deaths to almost 4 million -- about 8 percent of the state's annual turkey production.

In Iowa, even before the Rembrandt disclosure, the H5N2 bird flu this week [week of 27 Apr 2015] was confirmed at 4 other egg-laying farms. Without the Rembrandt farm, the US Department of Agriculture placed the number of doomed chickens in that state at 10 million, about 17 percent of the state's layer hens. Iowa is the nation's largest source of eggs; Minnesota is the biggest US turkey producer.

At the Rembrandt facility, the avian flu has been found in one barn containing about 250 000 hens, said Jonathan Spurway, the company's vice president of marketing and optimization. "It is isolated in that barn."

The company is talking with the USDA about the fate of the rest of the flock. So far, all "flock plan" agreements with the USDA have called for the destruction of every bird on a stricken farm. If all affected hens on the Rembrandt property are killed, it would be the largest single poultry loss since the bird flu surfaced in North America last winter [2014-2015] and would bring the percentage of Iowa layer hens lost to 25 percent.

Birds killed by the disease are financial losses borne by the farm's owner. The USDA pays growers an indemnity for poultry that are euthanized. The indemnity, the USDA acknowledges, does not make the grower whole.

Rembrandt Enterprises was the nation's 3rd-largest egg company at the end of 2014, with 14.5 million hens, according to Egg Industry, a trade magazine. Rembrandt said its egg operations in Renville and Thompson, Iowa, have not been affected by the flu.

The ultimate source of the bird flu is believed to be wild waterfowl, yet exactly how it's creeping into enclosed barns -- and for that matter the recently infected Minnesota hawk -- is puzzling animal health experts.

"We are really in research mode," said Carol Cardona, a veterinary bioscience professor at the University of Minnesota. "There's a whole bunch of stuff we don't know."

While deadly to poultry, the bird flu is a low risk for human health, and there are no US reports of people getting sick from it.

The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources collected the dead Cooper's hawk in Yellow Medicine County as part of its effort to track and understand the spread of H5N2 bird flu. Waterfowl don't themselves get sick or die from the flu, but raptors -- birds of prey -- are thought to die once infected.

A homeowner near St Leo [Yellow Medicine County, Minnesota] reported that on [14 Apr 2015], the Cooper's hawk flew into his home's deck and died. "The immediate cause of death was running into a window," said Patrick Redig, a University of Minnesota veterinary professor and co-founder of the school's Raptor Center. Later testing showed that the bird had been exposed to H5N2.

The hawk discovery doesn't indicate the virus in wild birds is the direct cause of the bird flu, said Lou Cornicelli, DNR Wildlife Research manager. Yellow Medicine County doesn't have any infected poultry farms, but nearby Lyon County does.

The DNR said it does not know of any recent raptor die-offs.

The Raptor Center has been testing live eagles, owls, hawks, and peregrine falcons since January [2015], not long after the highly pathogenic bird flu surfaced in North America. After several dozen tests, "we have yet to encounter any influenza" in those birds, Redig said.

"Time will tell if this is an anomaly or indicative of something larger," he said. Raptors would likely get the bird flu from eating infected waterfowl. However, a Cooper's hawk, while it eats small birds, does not eat waterfowl, Cornicelli said. "That's where we get more questions."

The DNR has been sampling waterfowl feces in Minnesota over the past month, looking for the H5N2 virus, but finding nothing.

The agency has collected 2749 samples, nearing its goal of 3000. "That's a lot of samples," Cornicelli said. More than 2200 results have been negative, and over 500 tests are pending.

Across the country, no environmental fecal samples from waterfowl have tested positive for highly pathogenic avian flu, according to the USDA.

The flu has been detected in roughly 50 waterfowl -- either dead or alive -- in western states, notably Oregon and Washington, according to the USDA. Those birds, which travel the migratory bird route known as the Pacific flyway, particularly include mallard ducks. 3 geese in Missouri were found to have the virus in March [2015], while a goose and duck tested positive this week [week of 20 Apr 2015] in Kentucky.

Missouri and Kentucky are on the Mississippi flyway, the route birds travel to and from the south through the Upper Midwest.

As the USDA confirmed the infection in 3 more Iowa facilities, the total number of Iowa birds affected by avian flu was fast approaching 10 million.

The 1st infected flock was at a commercial turkey farm in Buena Vista County. Then, more than 5 million hens were to be euthanized after bird flu was found at a commercial egg-laying facility in Osceola County. The facility was quarantined and the birds had to be euthanized to prevent the spread of H5N2 avian influenza.

Days later, state authorities were testing four more probable cases of bird flu at commercial poultry farms in Osceola, O'Brien, and Sioux counties. The USDA confirmed those cases, bringing the total to 8 commercial farms, and a total of 9 816 900 birds, infected with H5N2 avian influenza.

Iowa appears to be hardest hit, with a total of 15 453 273 birds affected in 13 states as of 30 Apr 2015, according to the USDA.

Iowa legislators joined together to send a letter to Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, asking for timely updates on the spread and impact of bird flu, including the affect it will have on commercial flocks as well as poultry and egg consumers.

"Since December 2014, the United States Department of Agriculture [USDA] has confirmed several cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5 in the Pacific, Central, and Mississippi flyways (or migratory bird paths). The disease has been found in wild birds, as well as in a few backyard and commercial poultry flocks. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers the risk to people from these HPAI H5 infections to be low. No human cases of these HPAI H5 viruses have been detected in the United States, Canada, or internationally," the USDA statement said.

Report sick birds or unusual bird deaths to the USDA by calling 1-866-536-7593.93.

[The state of Iowa can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=3336780,218. A county map can be seen at http://geology.com/county-map/iowa-county-map.gif.

This disease continues to progress rapidly across several areas and states. Research that provides answers quickly is certainly needed to stop the spread of this virus. The livelihood of people and a food source are being dramatically and perhaps irrevocably affected. It seems to spread faster than the tallies for affected birds or dead birds can be keep up with.

The finding in the hawk, as noted above, is very interesting. It certainly seems to indicate that possibly a variety of wild birds may be able to carry the virus and potentially infect many more. - Mod.TG]
