Foot-and-mouth outbreaks "no cause for alarm"
---------------------------------------------
Government officials yesterday insisted there was no cause for alarm after
almost 500 animals died in the 4 months prior to January in one of Hong
Kong's biggest outbreaks of Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) in recent years.
During that period, the Government received reports from farmers of 2152
pigs infected in 17 outbreaks. Of these, 464 died.
News of the outbreaks coincided with a major scare over FMD, which prompted
a halt to pork exports from England and Wales.
Dr. Leslie Sims, assistant director of the Agriculture, Fisheries and
Conservation Department, said there was no sign of a major outbreak in the
SAR [the Special Administrative Region, as the Chinese government now
refers to Hong Kong]. He said vaccines had been used on pigs to control the
disease, which has existed in Hong Kong for almost 50 years. However, he
admitted the vaccine was not perfect and some farmers did not administer it
properly, resulting in pig deaths. "The vaccine is not absolutely 100
percent protective and the disease cannot be completely eliminated," Dr.
Sims said.
In 1999, 340 pigs died in 9 outbreaks, compared with more than 1700 deaths
in 14 outbreaks the year before. There are 330 livestock farms rearing more
than 400 000 pigs in the SAR. Dr. Sims said Hong Kong did not have to react
in the same way as the United Kingdom because the disease would not affect
human health and no livestock was exported from the SAR.
The European Union, Canada, the United States, Singapore, and South Korea
have banned fresh and frozen meat from the UK. The SAR has only banned
livestock.
Fung Kin-chung, secretary-general of the Hong Kong Livestock Industry
Association, said the Association was worried about a major outbreak, while
pig farmers in the New Territories admitted the disease was widespread but
denied it was out of control. Leung Chik, 82, chairman of the Pig Farmers'
Association, said the death rate of infected pigs had actually decreased.
But Wong Kwong-wing, chairman of the separate Hong Kong Pig Farmers'
Association, said SAR farmers were reluctant to kill sick pigs immediately,
making it easier for the disease to spread.
"Most local farmers put their hopes on vaccinations and medicine and will
only abandon their pigs when nothing can be done," he said. A spokesman for
the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department said its contractor had been
told to pick up dead animals being dumped improperly by farmers.
There are 78 collection points in Yuen Long, Tuen Mun and Northern District.
