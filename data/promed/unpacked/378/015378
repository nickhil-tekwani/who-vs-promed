The observations that "mistakes" have been made by MAFF in the UK and those
same "mistakes" would be made by the USA are interesting, coming from an
outside source in South America.
I would counter that MAFF has learned and adapted from situations that have
arisen during the current UK crisis, and the USA (along with those American
veterinarians who have been in the UK assisting MAFF) also is trying to
learn and prepare. It appears to me the more rapid culling of infected
animals and animals immediately adjacent to infected farms has worked.
Simply looking at the daily incidence of new cases shows that.
Has this been a popular decision in the UK? No. Would such actions in the
USA be popular? Probably not, but the UK experience offers us the
opportunity to strengthen our response. In the USA, we know we must impose
movement restrictions at least statewide or possibly regionally as soon as
possible.
USDA Veterinary Services is working very hard at the national level, and
many states are working just as diligently at the state level to educate
government officials, producer groups, and other stakeholders about what
will be needed to combat FMD.
A multi-faceted response from multiple agencies will be necessary.
Education is a VITAL element to combating FMD. All of the stakeholders need
to be fully aware of what will happen.
Yes, the USA could live with FMD or a long-term vaccination program, but I
would suggest our current system of beef production would suffer greatly.
FMD does not always simply "run its course," especially in a naive population.
I suggest comment from countries with endemic FMD would be appropriate
here. Would you rather live with FMD or without it? From my own
conversations with a trusted veterinary colleague who has worked in Africa
and my own observations in the UK, I believe the US animal industry would
lose at least 20% of its current efficiency as far as meat production is
concerned. The present US system of finish-feeding would be very hard-hit,
and meat prices to the consumer would therefore increase, probably for a
long time to come.
Cattle producers in the USA are not subsidized as in the EU, and I believe
many smaller producers could not absorb the added costs of production (and
overt losses) caused by endemic FMD.
There are now reports of free-ranging deer having lesions consistent with
FMD in the UK. The USA has far larger populations of deer and elk, and at
greater densities than many areas of the UK. Trying to "live with FMD"
would very likely compromise our wildlife populations and our management
efforts regarding those populations, because vaccination of free-ranging
ungulates is very difficult, if not impossible.
One of the things I have stressed in my meetings with livestock producers
and other officials is that FMD eradication would not be a painless path in
the USA. I believe state and federal government can try to mitigate the
difficulties for their constituents as best they can, but there will still
be problems. As a regulatory veterinarian, I firmly believe the absence of
diseases such as FMD has positively contributed to the progress of
animal-based industries in the USA. Simply surrendering to the problem of
FMD is a step backward, in my opinion.
Having worked with MAFF (UK) field staff in Lancashire, I salute the
efforts these people have made and their accomplishments. I also salute
those farmers who have been affected. My particular agency in the USA holds
the tenet that we work for our producers, and we will follow their lead
whenever possible. Thus far our producers do not wish to live with FMD
(they truly do not want it in the first place) so we will continue to plan
for eradication should the infection rear its ugly little head in North
America. Thank you for your consideration.

[Does anyone seriously believe movement restrictions can be enforced in the
USA, given that farmers living next to a farm with even a suspected case
are very likely to ship their livestock before restrictions are imposed?
Remember, US livestock do not have animal passports as they do in the UK.
Infected livestock from the index case in the UK had passed through 6
widely separated markets in the week before the outbreak was confirmed on
20 Feb 2001, with sales from just one of those (Longtown) giving rise to
over 200 subsequent cases. - Mod.JW
