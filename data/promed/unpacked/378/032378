A possible case of mad cow disease was reported on 10 Sep 2001 for the
first time in Japan. The Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry in
Japan said at the news conference the suspected case was a 5-year-old
female Holstein from a dairy farm in Chiba prefecture, east of Tokyo.
The cow was found unable to stand up straight in August. The first test
conducted by the National Institute of Animal Health in Germany turned out
to be negative. However, subsequent necropsy revealed tiny holes in her
brain, and the second test was positive. The ministry insisted it was too
early to conclude the disease was mad cow (BSE, Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy).
The animal was destroyed and burned. Other cows at the same farm have been
isolated. No human case of variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease has been
reported in Japan.

Suspicion of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in Japan
------------------------------------------------------
Information received on 10 Sep 2001 from Dr Shigeo Miyajima, Director of
Animal Health Division, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries,
Tokyo:
A 5-year-old Holstein cow kept on a dairy farm in Chiba prefecture was
slaughtered on 6 Aug 2001 at an abattoir.
As the cow had dystaxia, a brain sample was taken and sent to the National
Institute of Animal Health (NIAH) and subjected to Prionics Check test with
a negative result on 15 Aug 2001.
A brain sample from this cow was also sent to the prefecture Livestock
Hygiene Service Center and subjected to histopathological examination and
found to have vacuoles on 24 Aug 2001.
The same brain sample was sent to the NIAH on 6 Sep 2001 for
histopathological examination with the same result, and subjected to
immunohistochemical examination with a positive result on 10 Sep 2001.
Control measures: immediately after bovine spongiform encephalopathy was
suspected, the herd was been placed under quarantine by the prefecture
veterinary inspector.

Mad-cow disease outbreak hits Chiba
-----------------------------------
A cow suspected of suffering from mad-cow disease has been found in Chiba
Prefecture, the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry said Monday.
If confirmed, this will be the first time that a cow suffering from the
disease has been discovered in Japan, ministry officials said.
At the instruction of the ministry, the 5-year-old female cow, kept by a
dairy farmer in the prefecture, was euthanized to prevent the disease from
spreading. The ministry is withholding the identity of the farmer.
The cow showed symptoms typical of mad-cow disease, such as difficulties in
standing, in early August, prompting the Chiba Prefectural Government and
the semi-governmental National Institute of Animal Health to examine the cow.
The ministry has extracted part of the cow's brain and intends to
commission British and Swiss research institutes specializing in the
disease to examine the brain.
The source of the disease in Japan has yet to be confirmed, but experts say
it may have come from imports of risky feed from Britain, a repeat of the
process believed to have spread BSE from UK herds to other European countries.
The disease is caused when cattle eat infected meat-and-bone meal, or
crushed animal carcasses, and cases have been uncovered across Europe, most
of which have been blamed on Britain.
Japan imported animal feedstuffs, including meat-and-bone meal at the peak
of the UK mad cow crisis in 1990, but banned such imports in 1996.
But the nation's food and agriculture industry was bracing for a possible
crisis as some experts warned the disease, whose human variant (vCJD) is
thought to have killed more than 100 people in Britain, could be more
widespread. Scientists believe milk is unlikely to spread the disease.
