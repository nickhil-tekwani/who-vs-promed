Suspected foot-and-mouth disease breaks out in Zambia
-----------------------------------------------------
A suspected outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) has developed in
Southern province in Zambia, affecting 1200 head of cattle, the official
Zambia News Agency reported Mon 12 Jul 2004.
Southern province veterinary officer Linous Munsimbwe was quoted as saying
that the most affected area is Katengwa, in Namwala district. He said that
the disease is characterized by lesions on the feet, and in the mouths, of
affected animals. Munsimbwe attributed the disease to the presence of
buffalo in the area, which are carriers of the virus. He said a team of
veterinary officers in Namwala are already in the affected area to
investigate, and contain, the disease. He called on the central veterinary
research institute to send a team of experts to get samples from affected
animals, and, to confirm the disease.
Authorities in the province, he said, have imposed a provisional ban on the
movement of cattle in Namwala and Monze districts in order to prevent the
further spread of the disease. The veterinary department will quarantine
animals, and, disinfect the premises and infected materials in a bid to
contain the disease, he said.

[FMD has been spreading in Zambia since February 2004; an emergency report,
and 5 follow-ups, have been duly sent to the OIE. In follow-up report No 4,
received by the OIE on 3 Jun 2004, the following information was included:
<http://oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_42.HTM#Sec2>
"Laboratory where diagnosis was made: Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute,
South Africa.
Diagnostic tests used:
- ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay);
- PCR (polymerase chain reaction).
Virus isolation could not be done because the samples arrived warm at the
laboratory 2 weeks after collection.
Causal agent: FMD virus serotypes SAT 1, SAT 2, SAT 3, and O."
Hopefully, fresh samples from the current outbreak will be sent for virus
isolation and identification. - Mod.AS]
