I would like to inform you that samples (hearts, blood/serum and swabs), which have been sent during late last week [12 Nov 2015] from the Palestinian Authority for laboratory examinations in the FMD laboratory of the Kimron Veterinary Institute, have been found positive for FMD virus. The tentative results of serotyping is FMDV-O.

The samples were withdrawn in a sheep flock in the village Jamma'in, in the Nablus (Shechem) district, about 15 km [9.3 mi] from the city of Nablus, north of the city of Ariel. The flocks includes about 600 sheep, of which 450 ewes. The vaccination history of the flock is yet to be clarified.

The reason for suspecting FMD was the sudden death of about 70 lambs, 7-10 days old, or approximately 50 percent of the lambs of similar age, present at the flock. No clinical signs were, reportedly, seen before the lambs' per-acute death. The changes recorded in the autopsy, which was carried out in several of the dead lambs, included increased thoracal fluid, lung edema, myocarditis, myocardial haemorrhages, and myocardial focal necrosis ("tiger heart").

Israel's district veterinary offices are instructed to complete the earliest the annual FMD vaccination of the sheep and goat herds within their respective territorial responsibility, including the few farms served/controlled by them in the West Bank. Veterinary practitioners, herdsmen, and animal breeders throughout the country are called to be alert and to report immediately on suspected cases.

FMD has been characterized in Israel and the West Bank, since decades, by a seasonal pattern, in most cases epizootics starting during January-March, peaking in May. As a matter of fact, no FMD case has been recorded in November for many years. The vast majority of the outbreaks was caused by serotype O. In 2013, the FMD season started, surprisingly, in November, when an outbreak of FMDV-O was detected in a sheep flock in Jericho (West Bank); this was followed by several outbreaks elsewhere, in both the West Bank and Israel. The disease did not spread, most likely due to the compulsory, general vaccination policy, covering cattle, sheep, and goats, countrywide. The current outbreak, similarly affecting sheep, seems to follow the same timing pattern. It will be interesting to see if future years witness a changed chronology.

Sudden death of offspring in ruminants, due to cardiac arrest caused by the FMD virus, is a long-known phenomenon. Such events, even on large scale, have been registered in Israel several times. In the same flocks, adult sheep/goats may remain clinically unaffected.

Confirmation of the serotyping and results of the expected genotyping are anticipated with interest. The vaccine applied in Israel includes the strains O-Manissa and O-3039, supposed to confer protection against several FMD-O strains circulating in the region. - Mod.AS
