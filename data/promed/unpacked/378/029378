Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -- update -- 17 Mar 2014
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On [26 Feb 2014] and [6 Mar 2014], the Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia announced an additional 2 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

Details of the case announced on [26 Feb 2014] are as follows:
A 56-year-old woman from Riyadh region with underlying medical conditions. She became ill on [12 Feb 2014] and was admitted to a hospital on [22 Feb 2014]. The patient had no known contact with animals or with previously laboratory-confirmed case.

Details of the case announced on [6 Mar 2014] are as follows:
An 86-year-old man from Riyadh region with no reported symptoms of illness. He is reported to have had contact with a previously laboratory-confirmed case.

Globally, from September 2012 to date [17 Mar 2014], WHO has been informed of a total of 191 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 82 deaths.

WHO advice
----------
Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. Health care facilities that provide for patients suspected or confirmed to be infected with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus from an infected patient to other patients, health care workers and visitors. Health care workers should be educated, trained and refreshed with skills on infection prevention and control.

It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because some have mild or unusual symptoms. For this reason, it is important that health care workers apply standard precautions consistently with all patients -- regardless of their diagnosis -- in all work practices all the time.

Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to all patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection. Contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection. Airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.

Patients should be managed as potentially infected when the clinical and epidemiological clues strongly suggest MERS-CoV, even if an initial test on a nasopharyngeal swab is negative. Repeat testing should be done when the initial testing is negative, preferably on specimens from the lower respiratory tract.

Health care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations. All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.

People at high risk of severe disease due to MERS-CoV should avoid close contact with animals when visiting farms or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. For the general public, when visiting a farm or a barn, general hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals, avoiding contact with sick animals, and following food hygiene practices, should be adhered to.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

[On 26 Feb 2014 there was a Saudi Ministry of Health (MOH) announcement of a laboratory-confirmed case of MERS in a 56-year-old female with co-morbidities from Riyadh. At that time it was announced she was in intensive care. (see prior ProMED-mail post MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (11): Saudi Arabia, WHO 20140301.2308415 and original MOH announcement at http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CoronaNew/PressReleases/Pages/mediastatemenet-2014-02-26-001.aspx). On 12 Mar 2014, there was a WHO update mentioning a 56-year-old female from Riyadh with date of onset of illness on 17 Feb 2014 who died on [3 Mar 2014] (see prior ProMED-mail post MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (13): Saudi Arabia, UAE, WHO 20140313.2330878 and original WHO announcement at http://who.int/csr/don/2014_03_12/en/). At that time, the official WHO global tally of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infections was 189 including 82 deaths.

The above announcement mentions a 56-year-old woman from Riyadh region with date of onset of illness on 12 Feb 2014, also with co-morbidities. There is no announcement of a 2nd 56-year-old woman from Riyadh on the Saudi MOH website. The query is whether this represents a different case, not previously reported on the Saudi MOH website, or whether this is revised information on the earlier reported case, changing the date of onset from 17 Feb 2014 to 12 Feb 2014.

The above report also confirms a MERS-CoV infection in the 86-year-old asymptomatic male contact of another laboratory confirmed case previously reported on the Saudi MOH website and on ProMED-mail (see prior ProMED-mail post MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (13): Saudi Arabia, UAE, WHO 20140313.2330878).

According to the most recent global tally of laboratory-confirmed Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections reported by WHO provided in the 17 Mar 2014 update contained in this report, there have been a total of 191 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 82 deaths. This moderator's line listing of reported laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection has 197 cases including 83 deaths. It does not include a 2nd 56-year-old female with date of onset of illness 12 Feb 2014.

Clarification from knowledgeable sources would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
