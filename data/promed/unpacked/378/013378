Warning of epidemic on salmon farms
--------------------------------------------
Anti salmon-farm campaigners fear that Scotland could be facing a
foot-and-mouth-style epidemic after the discovery of a deadly wasting
disease among stocks at more than 70 percent of fish farms.
Infectious pancreatic necrosis (IPN) has been found in 7 out of 10
sea cage salmon farms. Although harmless to humans, IPN can kill up
to 80 percent of susceptible fish.
A report, published by the Fisheries Research Service for the
Scottish Executive, in December 2003, revealed that positive tests
for the virus had increased from less than 50 percent in 2000 to 82
percent in 2002.
"Infectious diseases are spreading like wildfire throughout the
Scottish salmon farming sector," Don Staniford, managing director of
the Salmon Farm Protest Group, said. But John Webster, of Scottish
Quality Salmon, said yesterday [1 Jun 2004] that the fears had been
exaggerated.

[The expressed views of political campaigners regarding IPN, and
fish-farming, in Scotland call for the posting of an excerpt from the
original document cited above: "Final report of the Aquaculture
Health Joint Working Group subgroup on infectious pancreatic necrosis
in Scotland. 95 pages. Aberdeen, December 2003". Interested readers
may refer to the URL for the full text of the Report. (FRS is an
agency of the Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs
Department). - Mod.AS].
Chapter 3.4: A description of the regional and temporal patterns of
IPN virus prevalence in Scottish salmon farms 1996-2002: conclusions
-----------------------------------------------
IPN virus became widespread on Scottish salmon farms during the
period 1996-2002. Prevalence shows a large variation, IPN virus being
the most common (88 percent prevalence), in Shetland marine sites in
2002, while remaining undetected in fresh water sites in the Outer
Hebrides for several years. Prior to 2001, this variation was largely
controlled by differences between regions, with the effect of
differences between fresh water and sea water environments, and
year-to-year differences, being of secondary significance.
Recently, the role of regional differences has declined, while that
of inter-annual variation has increased. Seasonal differences in IPN
virus prevalence are small in spite of large differences in case
numbers.
Year-to-year differences are highly significant in that, except in
the southern mainland, this variance reflects a trend of increasing
IPN virus prevalence at an annual rate of 3 percent in fresh water
and 7.6 percent in sea water, but local increases sometimes happen
faster than this.
In Orkney, the northern mainland, and, particularly, the Outer
Hebrides, these increases were from low to moderately high levels.
However, in Shetland, the initial prevalence was not low, so IPN
virus had become almost ubiquitous in sea water by 2000. By 2002,
very high prevalence had been reached in marine waters in almost all
areas. In fresh water sites, the prevalence of IPN virus also shows
rapid increase, which is faster in Shetland fresh water sites than in
fresh water sites elsewhere. More statistical analysis of the data
for 1996-2001 is available elsewhere.
This analysis is a description of the FRS Fish Health Inspectorate's
data set, and biases with respect to real IPN virus prevalence may
result from the different purposes for which these data were
collected. However, levels of prevalence correspond closely to the
number of farms under movement restriction. Moreover, the patterns
obtained from these data should be buffered against such biases,
being dependent on relative prevalence. These patterns of declining
regional variation, and, a general, but not universal, increase in
prevalence of IPN virus, are striking.

[Our moderator, MHJ, has added the following remark: "It is worth
noting that there are striking markers for climate change in the UK
in recent years, from birds, to butterflies, to, in this case, fish
diseases, and the possibility of WNV".
Though using FMD terminology in relation to IPN does not reflect an
overly scientific attitude, the campaigners' concern is
understandable. We shall be glad to obtain and post first-hand data
on IPN's evolution in Scotland during 2003 and the current year 2004.
