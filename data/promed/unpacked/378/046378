A Comment on the Vulnerability of Children to Vampire Bat Bite
-------------------------------------------------
Regarding the posting on the current human rabies epidemic due to vampire
bat bites in northern Peru, which seems to be affecting predominantly the
pediatric population [see: ProMED-mail post entitled: "Rabies, human,
vampire bats - Peru 20050118.0170"], I was reminded of my personal
experience in the remote Mosquitia area of Honduras and Nicaragua.
Vampire bats pose a significant problem there as well, especially in the
middle and upper ranges of the Coco River. While I was director of a rural
health program for Miskito and Mayagna Indians there in the late 80s and
early 90s, I had people with vampire bites coming for their post-exposure
rabies prophylaxis on a regular basis, sometimes weekly, and at times in
family groups (fortunately many villagers, especially in our area, were
aware of the problem and of the risk of rabies that bats posed; our own
problem was to keep our small hospital well-stocked with vaccine).
I also noticed an increased prevalence of bites in children, perhaps 60-70
percent of the cases; most common sites affected were the great toe, the
foot, the scalp and the tip of the nose. This empirical observation seems
to contradict some studies that have shown increased vampire bite
prevalence in adult (mostly male) humans. The discrepancy could be due to a
number of reasons, including the demographics of the population studied
(some of these surveys have done in mining areas of the Brazilian and
Venezuelan Amazon region, where the population at risk would be expected to
be predominantly adult and male); the food-seeking behavior pattern of the
animals, which locate and recognize their hosts by detection of radiating
body heat by means of special receptors in their noseleaf, as well as by
the sense of smell and by echolocation: perhaps young children, having
higher metabolic rates than adults, present an easier-to-find source for a
bloodmeal.
Children also have a thinner corneal layer in their epidermis and more
superficial and larger number of capillary vessels in their skin, all of
which would make the bite more "productive" from the bat's perspective.
Lastly, there could be differences in bloodmeal-seeking behavior between
northern (e.g. Central American) and southern (South American) bats, even
belonging to the same species (probably the common vampire, _Desmodus
rotundus_, as the Moderator mentions). Finally, it is important to remember
that most people (adults or children) do not realize they have been bitten
until they wake up then next morning, usually with a moderate amount of
blood surrounding the lesion, due to the anticoagulant effect of the bat's
saliva. Vampire bats bites are typically painless, and one wonders if, in
addition to the known anticoagulants, the animal's saliva also contains
some compound which acts as a form of topical anesthetic.
