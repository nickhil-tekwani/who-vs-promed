[As we collect more instances of influenza pandemic (H1N1) in swine,
it is important that intensive outbreak investigations be carried out
to identify the source. Clearly this will mean close cooperation
between health sectors as, based on the data to date, the most likely
culprit will be a sick human. Another interesting feature of the
recent spate of outbreaks of pandemic H1N1 influenza in swine is that
in some cases, like this one and the one in Mexico, the number of
affected swine is literally just a few pigs. In other instances
though, a sizeable proportion of the pigs on farm get sick. For
instance, in Italy a few days ago, 375 out of 1250 pigs were sick and
in Finland, 800 out of 950 became ill. - Mod.PC]
