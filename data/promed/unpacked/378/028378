Botulism disease, which for the 2nd consecutive year has caused the death of a large number of migratory birds in Miankaleh and Gorgan Bay, has reached Ashuradeh Island, Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported on Tuesday [23 Feb 2021].

Botulism is caused by a toxin produced by the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_, and the birds become [intoxicated] by the ingestion of plants or animals infected with the toxin and lose their lives. _C. botulism_ is an anaerobic bacterium that grows in decaying plants and animal material and often occurs in lakes during periods of lack of oxygen and poor water quality.

The carcasses were mostly from bird species of flamingo, coot, duck, and pelican, which have been discovered around the shores of the Bandar Torkaman city, Ali Bayani, head of the provincial department of environment said.

In January 2020, media reported the mysterious death of over 40 000 migratory birds in the Miankaleh peninsula; a week later, the veterinary organization announced that "botulinum poisoning" was the reason behind mass bird mortality.

Excessive hunting in migratory birds' habitats in the country has made the Convention on Migratory Species warn some countries about this issue, which has always been a global threat to biodiversity and has attracted international attention. Now, along with illegal hunting, there are other environmental threats, including water pollution and wastewater flow and lack of provision of wetlands' water rights, [that] cause the management of migratory birds' habitats to get out of control.

The long and narrow peninsula is 48 kilometers (about 30 mi) long, and between 1.3 and 3.2 kilometers (about 0.8 and 2.0 mi) wide, which sets apart the Gorgan Bay from the Caspian Sea. Four villages, namely, Ashuradeh, Qezel-e Shomali, Qezel-Mehdi, and Qavasatl, are situated on the peninsula.

Miankaleh was designated a Ramsar site in 1975. Major habitats include wetlands, inter-tidal mud with sandy shores, shallow marine waters, forests, peatlands, and agricultural areas. It is home to many unique Caspian birds and reptile species native to this region. It's also a very important internationally recognized refuge for migratory birds.

The peninsula water deficits, additionally mismanagement, unsustainable agricultural practices, and severe depletion of the wells and groundwater resources, have exacerbated the Miankaleh peninsula's condition.

Local people earn their income from agriculture, horticulture, animal husbandry, handicrafts, carpet weaving, traditional poultry farming, and tourism. Overgrazing, illegal hunting, fishing, deforestation, and the unplanned spread of villages are some of the challenges posing threat to the region's environment.

[Avian botulism is a paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin produced by the bacteria _Clostridium botulinum_. These bacteria are widespread in soil and require warm temperatures, a protein source, and an anaerobic (no oxygen) environment in order to become active and produce toxin. Decomposing vegetation and invertebrates combined with warm temperatures can provide ideal conditions for the botulism bacteria to activate and produce toxin. There are several types of toxin produced by strains of these bacteria; birds are most commonly affected by type C and to a lesser extent by type E. - Mod.PMB
