Wheat Growers Warned of New Rust
--------------------------------------
Wheat growers have been warned about a new strain of leaf rust that has
broken down one of the industry's most resistant genes, Lr24. The new race
was discovered in trial plots in South Australia in October and has the
potential to reduce yields by up to 50 percent in susceptible wheat crops.
Wheat varieties most at risk are Krichauff, Janz, Lang, Worrakatta, Sunco
and Cunningham. Wheat breeder John Shepherd says the outbreak is much more
widespread than initially thought.

[Wheat leaf rust is caused by _Puccinia triticina_. The disease is a major
cause of reduced yields in susceptible wheat cultivars. I would appreciate
it if our Australian colleagues could provide information on wheat leaf
rust incidence in Australia, and further information on the outbreak of the
Lr24 resistance-breaking race. Are there other genes that can be deployed?
The taxonomy of the wheat leaf rust pathogen, formerly known as _P.
recondita_ has been changed to _P. triticina_. The distinction between the
two pathogens was based on 3 criteria. The 2 pathogens produce their aecial
stages on different plant hosts. Alternate hosts for _P. triticina_ include
species in the Ranunculaceae, whereas those for _P. recondita_ are members
of the Boraginaceae. Teliospores of _P. triticina_ are much smaller than
those of _P. recondita_. Moreover, the genome size of _P. triticina_ is
smaller than that of _P. recondita_. More details on the taxonomy of the
pathogen can be seen at the USDA Cereal Disease Laboratory web site:
