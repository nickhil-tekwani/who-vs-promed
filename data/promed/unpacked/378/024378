Suspicion of a bacteria which in 2007 killed 463 red deer in Cadiz (Province)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Deputy Minister of Rural Development of the regional government,
Maria Jesus Pascual, acknowledged, in (the town of) Valladolid
yesterday that the deaths of red deer in Zamora and Leon may be due
to an infectious process with similar characteristics to that
recorded in 2007 in Cadiz, when 463 corpses were counted and their
deaths then were attributed to a bacterium called "pasteurella,"
although there is no evidence to support this hypothesis. The latest
suspicions of the Junta de Castilla y Leon on the cause of death of
deer are focused on a bacterium 3 years ago in Cadiz. It killed
almost half a thousand red deer.

Regional Government officials also in Valladolid stated that the
possibility of transmitting the disease (to livestock) is diminishing
because the number of corpses has declined, although the delegate of
the Board in Zamora said that the decline in the number of cases did
not mean that the disease was disappearing.

Heat Problems
-------------
The heat and high temperatures have also complicated the analysis of
dead deer, as so far they have only been able to obtain viable
samples of 7 deer and 5 of them have had their autopsies.

The goal now is to capture live specimens that have developed the
disease, since this makes it easier to determine the disease from
which they (the red deer) are suffering. To do this, some hunters
have offered to help with technicians from Castilla y Leon who intend
to organize waiting at dusk and evening (when the deer are about) to
try to catch a live specimen with the disease.

The disease is not localized equally throughout the Sierra de la
Culebra, but there is a very specific area where there are many other
cases and the southern part, where the disease has peaked causing
many of the deaths. Next to the game reserve and also in a sensitive
area, are 2 (hunting) boxes, in which 35 of the 95 bodies (of red
deer) have been located.

In addition, the Deputy Minister also referred to the possibility
that the disease may have have been influenced by the heat and high
temperatures.

[Again, ProMED-mail would appreciate any authoritative information
about the cause of this rather substantial die off. Any laboratory or
post mortem results that provided insight into the causal agent or
agents involved would be valuable and useful information, given the
scope of the die off. This mortality is occurring in a wild animal
population that has a unique niche as wild animals turned loose and
then hunted by people in this region. It is also a region where small
farmers let their cattle, sheep and goats out for grazing. A
definitive diagnosis is always helpful when an outbreak of disease
affects a wild population of animals but it is often more difficult to obtain.

A definitive diagnosis should be obtained, despite the difficulties
with the weather, because it is critical to ensure the outbreak is
not zoonotic in nature and to make optimal decisions about control
programs to prevent spread of the disease to ruminant small farm
holders located in the area. Because the outbreak is happening in
wild animals used for hunting, veterinary authorities who might be
able to provide a more definitive diagnoses should be part of a 'One
Medicine' team finding the definitive causal agent and controlling
its negative impact on animals in the region. - Mod.PC]
