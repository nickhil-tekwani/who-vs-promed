[In response to our request for information in posting 20081018.3296,
we have been directed to the presentation "Avian influenza in Saxony
- current situation" which was presented during the meeting of
SCFCAH, the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,
in Brussels on 15 Oct 2008. The following data, derived from the
presentation, address the issues raised, as a request for
information, in ProMED-mail's posting 20081018.3296. - Mod.AS]

Slide 9
Introduction of virus probably due to wild birds, however: no
detection of AIV in monitoring of wild birds in Saxony in 2008
(neither in poultry).

Further strategy: inhouse holding compulsory for 21 days, virological
investigations if negative, lifting of measures

Slide 10
Detection of H5 in Stadtgut Molkau (near Leipzig)

9 Oct 2008. Detection of H5 specific RNA in ducks and geese in the
framework of routine sampling, further investigations ongoing.

Animal population: 21 geese, 59 ducks, 25 chicken, 7 quails.

10 Oct 2008. Preventive killing of all animals.

14 Oct 2008. Confirmation of LPAI
