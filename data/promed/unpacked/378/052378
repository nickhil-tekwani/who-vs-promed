[_Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis_ (MAP) is an organism initially observed by Johne & Frothingham in 1895. MAP causes paratuberculosis or Johne's disease, an intestinal granulomatous infection. Paratuberculosis is found most often among domestic ruminants (cattle, sheep, goats, camelids and buffaloes) as well as wild ruminants (cervids) and has a global distribution. The disease has also been reported in horses, pigs, rabbits, stoat, fox and weasel.

Under natural conditions, the disease in cattle spreads by ingestion of MAP from the contaminated environment. The disease persists after the introduction of infected animals. Infection can be spread vertically to the fetus, and semen can be infected with the organism. The primary source of infection in calves is milk from infected cows or milk that is contaminated with the faeces of diseased cattle.

Clinical signs of paratuberculosis are a slowly progressive wasting and diarrhoea, which is intermittent at first, becoming progressively more severe until it is constantly present in bovines. It is also reported as a significant clinical sign in farmed deer. Diarrhoea is less common in small ruminants.

For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods, please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2014, Chapter 2.1.11 "Paratuberculosis (Johne's disease)", available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.11_PARATB.pdf (adopted by the World Assembly of Delegates of the OIE in May 2014).

The following information was obtained from the document entitled "The surveillance and control programme for paratuberculosis in Norway 2013 . Surveillance programmes for terrestrial and aquatic animals in Norway. Annual report 2013. Oslo: Norwegian Veterinary Institute 2014" by Kampen AH, Johansen TB, Valheim M, Norstrom M.: "Paratuberculosis was 1st diagnosed in cattle and goats in Norway in 1907 and 1934, respectively. _Mycobacterium avium subsp. Paratuberculosis_ infection in ruminants is a notifiable disease in Norway.

The control of this disease is enforced by government legislation and restrictions on animal movement. In goat herds, government restrictions combined with vaccination have been used to control paratuberculosis, however, over the last years a large proportion of Norwegian goat [herders] have followed a disease eradication programme to get rid of the infection.

A national surveillance and control programme for paratuberculosis in cattle was established in 1996. The programme was extended to llamas and alpacas, goats and sheep in 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively." See the complete document at http://www.vetinst.no/eng/Publications/Surveillance-Programmes-annual-reports/2013/The-surveillance-programme-for-paratuberculosis-in-Norway-2013.

"Paratuberculosis vaccines can cause severe local reactions including sloughing of tissues, chronic synovitis and tendonitis, if they are accidentally injected into humans. Some cases may require surgery."

Limited data suggest that _M. avium subsp. Paratuberculosis_ may be involved in Crohn's disease, a chronic enteritis of humans. Crohn's disease is characterized by periods of malaise, abdominal pain, chronic weight loss and diarrhea, with remissions and relapses. The disease often begins between the ages of 16 and 25 years, and persists lifelong. There is no cure. The cause of Crohn's disease is unknown; however, it may be the result of several interacting factors including a genetic predisposition, an abnormal immune response, and environmental factors including responses to intestinal microorganisms. _M. avium subsp. Paratuberculosis_ can be found in some patients; however, isolation is rare and studies to date have not been able to determine whether this organism has a causative role or is simply an "innocent bystander" that can grow in the inflamed intestinal wall." http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/paratuberculosis.pdf. - Mod.CRD
