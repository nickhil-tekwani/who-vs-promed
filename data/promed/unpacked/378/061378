National Trust wardens expect the recent outbreak of squirrel pox to
sweep through Formby's treasured population of red squirrels. [Map at
<http://www.multimap.com/maps/?&t=l&map=53.55755,-3.05645|14|4&loc=GB:53.55755:-3.05645:14&dp=841#t=l&map=53.55755,-3.05645|11|4&dp=841&loc=GB:53.55755:-3.05645:14>].

However, they are optimistic there is still time to prevent the fatal
disease from wiping out the protected animals entirely.

Two were discovered dead in Formby's pinewoods after contracting the
disease while a further 3 were found in the vicinity of Scarisbrick
and Great Altcar. Based on sightings, wardens fear that even more
squirrels are affected.

The squirrel pox virus is spread by non-native grey squirrels who are
unaffected by the illness. However, it is fatal to reds, who develop
lesions and malnutrition.
