I would like to provide more information and clarification on the
male anthrax case cited in the previous ProMED posting
[20070503.1440] on this event. After having sampled and burnt the
dead saiga he had found on the road home after going fishing, 10 days
later, on 22 Apr 2007, the man's right hand and forearm were covered
with sores, his temperature had risen, and he suffered from fever and
pain in his elbow. The sick man didn't consult a doctor, receiving
treatment at home.
By 24 Apr 2007, he felt worse and went to Sokuluk Regional Hospital.
He was taken to the infectious diseases division of the hospital, but
he left the same day. There was no prompt notice of the case. Later
the same day, he went to Bishkek to the infectious diseases hospital
where Dr. Obodoev K.I., a physician, examined him. The physician told
him to go to Municipal Hospital 2 with a phlegmon [?] diagnosis. But
instead, the man consulted his sister's neighbor, a surgeon. The man
received antibiotics intravenously and an analgin injection with
benadryl. The surgeon advised him to consult a doctor at the
infectious diseases hospital [IDH].
On 26 Apr 2007, he went to IDH, where "anthrax, skin type" was
diagnosed. The number of persons who had contact with him is being ascertained.
The patient's material was taken (blood, carbuncle content), and it
was delivered to RCQEHD laboratory for investigation. An allergy test
with antraxin [anthracin] was made. The test was distinctly positive.
Preventive and anti-epidemic activities are being implemented in the
focus area.

[This is an example of the retrospective advantages of the Russian
anthracin skin test. _Bacillus anthracis_ is normally very sensitive
to antibiotics, and therefore any treatment prior to a proper medical
examination can result in an inability to recover any viable
organisms. The man had waited so long that by 14 days, he was
skin-test positive. - Mod.MHJ]
