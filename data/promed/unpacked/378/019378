Blood donations from tourists who have visited the UK since 1980 should be
banned, scientists in the United States (US) have recommended. They say the
move is necessary to prevent the possible transmission of blood
contaminated with new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease [nvCJD, the human
form of mad cow disease.
Scientists do not yet know whether the disease can be passed on through
blood but a Food and Drug Administration [FDA committee has advised a ban
while studies continue.
There have been no known cases of the disease passing from one human to
another through blood but researchers suspect it is possible and the
committee is urging caution. Dr Linda Detweiler, a US Department of
Agriculture (USDA) veterinarian, said: "The day you find out there is
transmission, it's already too late."
Members of the FDA committee voted 12-9 in favour of restricting blood
donations for some potential donors who have visited Britain since 1980. It
failed to agree on what length of stay would be necessary to disqualify a
donor. [So what is the criteria for some tourist being rejected as donors
and others accepted? This was not make clear. Mod. TG
The FDA will decide in the coming months whether to order blood collection
centers to turn away people with a recent history of travel to the UK. A
survey of more than 9,000 US blood donors found that 22.6% had visited
Britain at least once since 1980 and most had eaten beef during their stay.
[Recent history of travel seems vague considering the 1980 date. Mod TG
The American Red Cross, the biggest collector of donated blood, said the
FDA should not impose the ban without stronger evidence. Dr Richard Davey,
the group's chief medical officer, said blood donations are expected to
fall short of demand next year. He said: "Any deferral at this time for
this theoretical risk cannot be justified at this time."
Mad cow disease, or BSE [bovine spongiform encephalopathy, first emerged
in Britain in the mid-1980s. Scientists eventually proved the disease could
be passed to humans through infected beef products. More than 30 Britons
are known to have died from the disease.
As the FDA discussed imposing the ban the UK's deputy chief medical officer
was saying the British public should not worry about the safety of its
blood supplies. Dr Jeremy Metters said: "In theory there is a risk. We
accepted that 18 months ago and we decided that we would take the white
cells, that are thought to be the problem, out of donated blood."

Some frequent American travelers to Britain should be prohibited from
donating blood as an extra safety precaution against the possible spread of
a fatal brain illness linked to mad cow disease, a Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) advisory panel says.
The panel made its decision in a 12-9 vote Wednesday, even though it had no
evidence that the deadly illness, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease (nvCJD), could spread through blood. Panel members stressed that
the precaution doesn't mean frequent tourists are at risk of getting the
illness just because they ate British beef, where mad cow disease resides.
But scientists simply don't know enough about this new illness that has
struck at least 39 Britons who apparently ate beef contaminated with mad
cow disease [Bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE to say for sure that it
could never be transmitted through blood.
Some experiments have allowed scientists to transmit similar illnesses to
animals through blood.
"The day you find out there is (human) transmission, you're years too late"
to protect the blood supply, warned Dr. Linda Detwiler of the Agriculture
Department (USDA).
If the FDA follows its advisers' recommendation, the next question is how
long someone had to visit Britain to be deemed enough of a risk to refuse
their blood. That's crucial because an American Red Cross study found
almost 23 percent of recent blood donors had traveled to Britain at least
once between 1980 and 1996. From the late 1980s through 1996, Britain
battled a mad cow disease epidemic in its cattle.
The advisory panel said the concern is not a typical week-long tourist
trip. A majority of panelists said Americans who spent a total of more than
6 months in Britain between 1980 and 1996 should be blocked from donating
blood - a recommendation that, if followed, could cut the U.S. blood supply
by 2.2 percent, the Red Cross said.
Mad cow disease is an infection that kills by literally eating holes in the
brain tissue of cattle. About one in 1 million people around the world gets
a similar brain disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, or CJD. Although
CJD sometimes is hereditary, usually its cause is not known.
The worry about blood stems from Britain's discovery in the mid-1990s that
some people caught a new strain of the disease called "new variant CJD"
apparently by eating beef infected with mad cow disease.
There is no known mad cow disease in US cattle, and the United States (US)
has not allowed importation of British beef for over a decade. No American
has caught nvCJD.
But because these brain diseases can incubate for years without causing
symptoms, some scientists say the possibility exists years from now they
will discover a link between blood transfusions and infection. Doctors are
closely watching Britain to see if that happens. Canadian health officials
last month decided they too would determine how to block blood donations
from certain Canadian travelers.
