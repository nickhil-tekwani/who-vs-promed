Sentinel chickens used by the Mobile County Health Department to detect mosquitoborne diseases in the community have tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis (EEE). Two chickens were located in the 36582 ZIP Code, while another chicken was located in the 36613 ZIP Code.

EEE, a form of mosquitoborne encephalitis, has been confirmed by laboratory results, according to Dr Bernard H Eichold II, health officer for the Mobile county. "There are no health benefits to being bitten by a mosquito," Eichold said. "Don't let your guard down. EEE has a human mortality rate of between 50 to 75 per cent, while West Nile virus is between 3 to 15 per cent. EEE is a very serious mosquitoborne illness."

The risk of encephalitis spread by mosquitoes is highest from August through the 1st freeze in the fall, Dr Eichold said. Jerry Folse, the director of MCHD's Vector Services, said his department will step up control efforts in the surrounding area.

Blood is drawn from the sentinel chickens every Monday by Vector Services, and the samples are sent to a lab in Tampa, Florida. The results of the tests are available later in the week. There were no reported EEE cases in Mobile County during 2016, and only one in 2015.

Health officials warn that it is extremely important that people taking part in outdoor activities make every effort to reduce their exposure to mosquitoes. Recommendations include:

- use an Environmental Protection Agency-registered repellent with DEET;
- wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants;
- stay and sleep in places with air conditioning or window and door screens;
- remove standing water around your home;
- EEE is transmitted from bird to mosquito to bird. Mosquitoes can spread these viruses by feeding on the blood of infected birds and then biting another host animal or mammal such as a human or a horse.

Although humans and horses can become ill from the infection, the diseases cannot be spread from people or horses. The likelihood of transmission to humans and horses can be decreased by personal mosquito avoidance and the use of an EEE or West Nile virus (WNV) vaccine in horses. There is no vaccine available for humans.

For about 25 years, Vector Services has been monitoring encephalitis in sentinel poultry flocks strategically placed in 13 coops throughout the county to detect the presence of viruses carried by mosquitoes. Mosquitoes also are trapped throughout the county and tested for WNV, EEE and St Louis encephalitis.

To report an issue with mosquitoes, call Vector Services at 251-690-8124. To learn more, please visit http://mchd.org and under "Services" select "Vector Control".

A 16 year old paint horse from Cabarrus County, North Carolina, has died after contracting eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE). This is the 1st confirmed case of EEE in North Carolina this year [2017].

A viral disease, EEE affects the central nervous system and is transmitted to horses by infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs of EEE include moderate to high fever, depression, lack of appetite, cranial nerve deficits (facial paralysis, tongue weakness, difficulty swallowing), behavioral changes (aggression, self-mutilation, or drowsiness), gait abnormalities, or severe central nervous system signs, such as head-pressing, circling, blindness, and seizures. The course of EEE can be swift, with death occurring 2 to 3 days after onset of clinical signs despite intensive care. Horses that survive might have long-lasting impairments and neurologic problems.

"If your horses exhibit any symptoms of EEE, contact your veterinarian immediately," said state veterinarian Doug Meckes. "And if your horses aren't vaccinated, talk to your veterinarian about vaccinating them as soon as possible against EEE and West Nile virus," another mosquitoborne disease.

The vaccinations initially require 2 shots, 30 days apart, for horses, mules, and donkeys having no prior vaccination history. Meckes recommends a booster shot every 6 months in North Carolina because of the state's prolonged mosquito season.

In addition to vaccinations, horse owners also need to reduce the mosquito populations and their possible breeding areas. Recommendations include keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, which are typically early in the morning and evening, and using mosquito repellents and fly gear. Further, mosquitoes can breed in any puddle that lasts for more than 4 days, so removing any source of standing water can reduce the chance of exposing animals to WNV or EEE.

People, horses, and birds can become infected from a bite by a mosquito carrying the diseases, but there is no evidence that horses can transmit the virus to other horses, birds, or people through direct contact.

[The 1st article mentions EEE in sentinel chickens. Birds are very susceptible to the EEE virus. Those areas using sentinel birds usually have a bit of warning that the virus is circulating in the area. It allows them a little bit of time to alert the public to the dangers of the mosquitoes, to remind the public to vaccine their horses and to use horse-appropriate mosquito repellent, and to remind them to protect themselves from other viruses mosquitoes carry.

The south and south eastern parts of the USA tend to have a rather protracted summer and mosquito season. Immunity to EEE wanes rather rapidly considering the length of the mosquito season in those locations. Therefore, vaccination every 4 months may be necessary. - Mod.TG
