Forty-two people in Georgia's capital Tbilisi have been hospitalized after
being infected with the anthrax bacteria over the last month, the Health
Ministry in the former Soviet republic said Wednesday.
The government doesn't have enough vaccine to fully protect the population,
and the potentially deadly disease could spread further, Health Ministry
spokesman Dzhoni Dzhanashiya said.
Many people have stopped buying beef in Tbilisi markets because the disease
was detected among cattle in several Georgian regions, Dzhanashiya said.

[It is a long tradition in the C.I.S. countries to vaccinate humans against
this disease; elsewhere it was limited to those occupationally exposed,
e.g., millworkers, stevedores. It is a reflection of the ongoing weaknesses
of the veterinary profession in these afflicted areas of the old USSR. A
proper veterinary control will protect the human population, as well as
livestock. - MHJ
