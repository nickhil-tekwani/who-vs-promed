Abstract
--------
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiologic agent of coronavirus disease and has been spreading worldwide since December 2019. The virus can infect different animal species under experimental conditions, and mink on fur farms in Europe and other areas are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We investigated SARS-CoV-2 infection in 91 mink from a farm in northern Poland. Using reverse transcription PCR, antigen detection, and next-generation sequencing, we confirmed that 15 animals were positive for SARS-CoV-2. We verified this finding by sequencing full viral genomes and confirmed a virus variant that has sporadic mutations through the full genome sequence in the spike protein (G75V and C1247F). We were unable to find other SARS-CoV-2 sequences simultaneously containing these 2 mutations. Country-scale monitoring by veterinary inspection should be implemented to detect SARS-CoV-2 in other mink farms.

[According to data included in the paper, following the culling of Denmark's farmed minks, Poland has become Europe's largest producer of mink pelts, with 810 fur animal farms, including those for foxes, mink, raccoon-dogs, and chinchillas. The 354 active mink farms in Poland contain roughly 6.3 million mink. During 2019, mink farmers in Poland sold 8.5 million mink pelts.

The paper addresses the testing of throat swab and blood specimens from minks culled for pelting at a mink farm in Pomorskie Voivodeship in northern Poland on 17 Nov 2020. The farm owner reported no respiratory symptoms in the animals. Their initial findings were published on 24 Nov 2020; see https://www.euronews.com/2020/11/24/polish-scientists-identify-first-cases-of-covid-19-at-a-mink-farm and item 2 in 20201127.7976927.

A 2nd infected farm, in the voivodeship Lubelskie, was reported by Poland to the OIE on 23 Jun 2021 (20210627.8478664). The samples were collected as a part of active monitoring, in accordance with applicable national regulations. No clinical signs were seen.

The paper has been authored by investigators from the universities of Gdansk (Poland) and Helsinki (Finland). Interestingly, the paper informs that the Gdansk University team has recently detected possible zoonotic spillover of SARS-CoV-2 in a worker employed at the farm described in this study (unpublished data). Preliminary genome analysis showed that the newly described isolates carry the combination of mutations typical of viruses isolated in November 2020, but additional new changes have accumulated since that time. They state: "We believe that wide monitoring of humans living near the mink farm should be performed to search for possible spillover and presence of new virus variants."

OIE's list of COVID-19 in animals, as reported by member countries as of 6 Jul 2021, is available at https://www.oie.int/en/what-we-offer/emergency-and-resilience/covid-19/#ui-id-3. The most recent reports addressing findings in mink came from Spain (29 Jun 2021). - Mod.AS
