Outbreak of measles may necessitate a mass vaccination response
---------------------------------------------------------------
The Center for Epidemiological Surveillance (NVE), University
Hospital Joao de Barros Barreto (HUJBB) has issued an alert following
the occurrence of measles in the city of Belem, district of Guama.
There is an urgent need to respond by mandatory reporting of
suspected cases, development of emergency facilities, and
organisation of mass vaccination. At present there are 216 suspected
cases of measles.

The definition of a suspected case of measles, regardless of age and
vaccination status, includes fever and maculopapular rash,
accompanied by one or more of the following signs and symptoms:
cough, coryza and conjunctivitis. A positive diagnosis requires
detection of IgM within 28 days of onset of rash.

The last case of indigenous transmission of measles, unrelated to
imported cases, was recorded in Mato Grosso do Sul, in November 2000.
Between 2001 and 2005, 9 cases of measles were all linked to
travelers who had acquired the infection in other countries (Japan,
Germany and the Falkland Islands).

[Brazil has been free from indigenous measles virus infection for
several years. It is unclear from this report whether any of the 216
suspected cases in the city of Belem have now been confirmed. Further
information is awaited.
