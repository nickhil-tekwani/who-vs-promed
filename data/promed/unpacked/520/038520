The Ministry of Health of CÃ´te d'Ivoire has
declared a yellow fever (YF) outbreak in the
capital, Abidjan. The outbreak was laboratory
confirmed at the beginning of May 2008.

In June 2008, the WHO deployed a GOARN mission
(the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network)
of 2 experts in order to assess the
epidemiological and entomological situation and
to investigate the risk of a full scale urban yellow fever outbreak.

After clinical, epidemiological and laboratory
investigation, the GOARN mission confirmed 2
yellow fever cases. The cases were reported in
different health districts of the capital,
Abidjan. One case is a 48-year-old female from
Cocody, who was vaccinated against yellow fever
in 1997, and the 2nd is a 20-year-old male from
the urban area of Treichville, who has never been
vaccinated against yellow fever.

The following conclusions were drawn by the GOARN mission:
(i) the epidemiological situation is that of a
temporal cluster of yellow fever cases without
geographic focus and without continuation at present;
(ii) although a mass vaccination campaign was
conducted in 2001 [see ProMED archives below],
the actual yellow fever vaccination coverage is
likely to be around or below 60 percent;
(iii) vectors capable of transmitting yellow fever are present in Abidjan; and
(iv) the entomological risk indexes (Breteau
index and Container index) [which measure the
abundance of the vector mosquito] were over the
threshold in all localities investigated,
indicating a high risk of yellow fever transmission.

As a result, the mission recommends that the
surveillance system to detect new yellow fever
cases is strengthened and that vector control measures are implemented.

Subsequent to the mission, in July 2008, a
further 3 laboratory confirmed cases were
reported by the Ministry of Health. In addition
to the standard IgM tests, more specific tests
were used for all cases at the regional reference
laboratory, Institut Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal,
to determine the presence of the yellow fever
virus and to exclude the presence of any other haemorrhagic fevers.

To date, the Ministry of Health has reported a
total of 9 suspected cases of yellow fever, including the 5 confirmed cases.

On the basis of these results, the Ministry of
Health has decided to carry out a mass
vaccination campaign in Abidjan, in August 2008,
targeting 1 938 161 people. The campaign will be
conducted with the technical assistance of the
WHO and the support of the GAVI alliance (the
Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization).
The previous mass vaccination campaign in Abidjan
took place in 2001, during which 2.6 million doses were administered.

Abidjan, which has a population of 3.5 million, a
YF vaccine coverage of less than 60 percent, and
vector mosquito densities above the danger
threshold, has been extraordinarily lucky not to
have suffered a roaring urban YF epidemic. Before
ProMED-mail began reporting in 1994, Nigeria had
huge YF epidemics with thousands of cases in the
under-vaccinated populations of major cities. Why
this outbreak has not happened in Abidjan sooner
is an epidemiological puzzle. - Mod.JW]
