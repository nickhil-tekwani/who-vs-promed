On 21 Sep 2010, the Governor of Bali signed an agreement (MOU) with
the Bali Animal Welfare Association to launch an island-wide rabies
vaccination project, to be funded by WSPA [World Society for the
Protection of Animals]. This move was based on the success of pilot
vaccination projects in Gianyar and Bangli (2 of the 9 districts of
Bali) and the evidence of the success of vaccination projects in
controlling rabies in many other countries around the world.

The need for an island-wide vaccination response was well known to
all partners. The vaccination in Gianyar and Bangli had lead to
decreased dog bites, dog rabies cases and human cases of rabies in
these districts; but these districts are not islands, and the
unheeded movement of both people and animals across borders meant
that the risk of rabies has continued, hence the call for an
island-wide strategy that would cover all districts.

The recent case of a human death from rabies in Gianyar is a tragedy,
as every death on Bali has been since the outbreak in 2008. The
geographical location for where this bite took place has not yet been
confirmed, only the home address of the victim. However, even if
Gianyar is established as the location of the bite event, this death
is unfortunately not a surprise to the partners involved in the
island-wide vaccination project, and the risk of this tragedy was
precisely why the concept of island-wide vaccination has been so
strongly supported. This is also the reason that all vaccination
campaigns run to date in Gianyar and Bangli, and those that will form
the island-wide vaccination project, have included education
programmes in post-exposure treatment to minimise human deaths from
the rabies risk that, although decreased through vaccination, will
continue until eradication is achieved.

[It is self-evident that extension of the dog vaccination programme
to all 9 districts of the island of Bali will reduce or even
eliminate human deaths attributable to dog-bite, and the WSPA
deserves every support in this effort. However, this alone is
unlikely to eliminate entirely the risk of rabies virus infection,
since the virus is believed to be present in other animals such as
felines and monkeys. It will be necessary to maintain indefinitely an
island-wide dog vaccination programme.

Travellers to Bali should be aware that the dog vaccination programme
at present only covers 2 of the 9 administrative regions of Bali. A
