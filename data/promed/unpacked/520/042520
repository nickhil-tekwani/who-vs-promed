The recent ProMED-mail postings on leptospirosis has prompted us to report
on a small outbreak that we have encountered in trappers in Ontario, Canada.
The Middlesex-London Health Unit in London, Ontario has investigated three
serologically confirmed cases of leptospirosis due to _L. grippotyphosa_ in
local trappers. One other trapper was clinically suspected to have
leptospirosis but this was not confirmed by the microscopic agglutination
test on acute and convalescent sera. All four men gave a history of
skinning raccoons in the month prior to onset of their symptoms in
November, 1997.
The four men presented with fever, headaches, chills, dry cough, muscle
aches and stiff neck which ranged in duration from two days to two weeks.
Two patients were jaundiced and required hospitalization. All the patients
had some elevation of their liver enzymes. All four men gave a history of
skinning raccoons without wearing gloves and of having multiple abrasions
on their hands. The first case to be recognized actually cut himself while
skinning a raccoon and required stitches.
The Laboratory Centre for Disease has recently completed testing of a small
number of raccoons from Middlesex and Kent counties in Ontario. Sera from
thirty-six raccoons from Middlesex and six raccoons from Kent counties were
tested by the microscopic agglutination test. Ten of the 42 raccoons tested
were seropositive for _L. grippotyphosa_. The positive raccoons came from
all six areas sampled.
Previous studies in southern Ontario have documented the occurrence of many
_Leptospira interrogans_ serovars such as _L. pomoma_ and _L. hardjo_ but
the grippotyphosa serovar had not been prominent. This pattern seems to be
changing with the recent documentation in Ontario of two cases of canine
leptospirosis due to the grippotyphosa serovar as well as the infections in
trappers described above.
