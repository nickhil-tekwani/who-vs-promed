As cases of salmonellosis continue to increase in North Carolina, the Buncombe County Department of Health says there was some positive news on Thu 3 May 2012.

Test results confirmed that the bacteria associated with the Buncombe outbreak is _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Paratyphi B, officials said, and the good news is that the particular strain causes symptoms that are less severe and it doesn't require control measures that are quite as strict. The changes in control measures means that new cases will not be required to take antimicrobials unless they have special health issues.

The cases started showing up last week. As of Thu 3 May 2012, 40 cases have been reported. Sue Ellen Morrison, the disease control supervisor for Buncombe County, said 26 of those cases [have been confirmed to] carry the same strain of Paratyphi B.

On Mon 30 Apr 2012, an Asheville company voluntarily recalled 12-ounce packages of unpasteurized soybean tempeh because of possible contamination with salmonellae. Lab results are expected later this week that should confirm whether the tempeh is a match to the type of salmonella associated with the current outbreak.

[2] County Health Department press release 4 May 2012

Today, 4 May 2012, Buncombe County Department of Health received additional test results from the North Carolina Department of Public Health laboratory confirming that the bacteria found in the tempeh is a match to the _S._ Paratyphi B that is making people sick in the current disease outbreak.

Health officials confirm that people are infected with this type of infection in 1 of 3 ways:
- Direct consumption of the tempeh
- Exposure to food items contaminated by uncooked tempeh
- Contact with someone who is ill with the infection

Lab tests yesterday, 3 May 2012, confirm that _S._ Paratyphi B associated with this outbreak causes a non-typhoidal salmonellosis; which means it causes symptoms that can be severe but not as severe as the other strain of _S._ Paratyphi B, which lab tests initially indicated.

The test results subsequently confirmed that the tempeh is associated with this outbreak, however cases are continuing to be reported. As of 3 May 2012, Buncombe County Environmental Health specialists have contacted all food establishments under the jurisdiction of the Buncombe County Department of Health to verify that the recalled tempeh has been removed.

As of 4 pm on 4 May 2012, the latest information about the outbreak is as follows:
- 46 cases
- 7 hospitalizations
- age range of those getting ill is 4 - 79 with a median age is 34
- 60 percent of cases are female

The number of cases of a bacterial infection that have sickened Buncombe County residents and visitors jumped up by more than 30 percent over the weekend.

The total number of salmonella cases reported since March [2012] has risen by 14, from 46 to 60 today, county health officials said this morning [7 May 2012].

The rare type of paratyphi B salmonella was traced to a locally made tempeh, a fermented bean product. Smiling Hara Tempeh made in Candler was pulled from stores and restaurants in April [2012]. That means the disease is now likely spreading person-to-person.

[The inference that the illnesses are less severe likely relates to the organism likely to be the d-tartrate fermenting variant _S. enterica_ subspecies _enterica_ serovar Paratyphi B dT+ (sometimes referred to as _S._ Java). This organism has well characterized animal reservoirs and has been involved in 3 relatively recent outbreaks reported in ProMED-mail -- 2 in the USA (Salmonellosis, serotype Paratyphi B - USA: raw tuna 20100428.1371; Salmonellosis, human, pet turtles - USA 20080125.0317) and the other in Europe (Salmonellosis, serotype Paratyphi var Java - Europe 20071221.4100).

This organism behaves more like the usual zoonotic salmonellosis as opposed to S. Typhi and other _S._ Paratyphi species which present usually as an "enteric fever," a longer illness mostly linked to fever without much diarrhea. - Mod.LL]
