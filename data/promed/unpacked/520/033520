Influenza virus activity in the world
-------------------------------------
Based on FluNet reporting (as of 27 Mar 2012, 14:00 UTC) during weeks 10 to 11 (4 Mar 2012 to 17 Mar 2012), National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 88 countries, areas or territories reported data. The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 50 919 specimens. 15 214 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 11 559 (76 percent) were typed as influenza A and 3655 (24 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 957 (15 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 5351 (85 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 420 (45 percent) belong to the B-Yamagata lineage and 509 (55 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

Summary
-------
During weeks 10 and 11 in 2012, laboratory confirmed influenza activity continued to increase in many countries in the northern hemisphere with regional and widespread outbreaks reported in a number of countries.

Influenza A(H3N2) continued to be the predominant virus subtype detected globally. In general, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 remained low with the exception of a few countries. Influenza B virus activity was high in a number of countries and was the predominant virus detected in Canada and China.

In Europe, outbreaks of influenza A(H3N2) were reported with increasing co-circulation of influenza B in some countries. In northern Africa, influenza A(H3N2) activity decreased with local outbreaks reported only in Algeria.

In the United States of America, influenza A(H3N2) remained the predominant virus subtype while in Canada influenza B detections continued to increase and surpassed the number of influenza A viruses reported. A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses remained the predominant virus subtype in Mexico. A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were reported in increasing proportions in some regions in the United States of America. In Central America, influenza activity increased in Guatemala with A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses the main circulating virus subtype.

In Asia, A(H3N2) and B virus influenza activity remained high, with B viruses predominating in China, China Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the Republic of Korea. Influenza A(H3N2) viruses remained predominant in Japan with some co-circulation of influenza B. In the Middle East, A(H1N1)pdm09 activity increased in Qatar.

In the southern hemisphere, influenza activity continued to be low with the majority of the sporadic virus detections identified as influenza A(H3N2).

[2] ECDC weekly report

Main surveillance developments in week 12/2012 (19-25 Mar 2012)
---------------------------------------------------------------
The 2011/12 influenza season started late and has been without any clear geographic progression. The following points are noteworthy this week:

- Decreasing trends were reported by 21 countries, 14 of which have reported such trends for at least 2 consecutive weeks while only Lithuania, Poland and Slovakia reported increasing trends.

- Of 940 sentinel specimens tested, 42.9 percent were positive for influenza virus. This proportion was unchanged compared to week 11 after declining steadily from a peak of 58 percent in week 8. Of the positive sentinel specimens, 75.2 percent were type A and 24.8 percent type B. The proportion of influenza B viruses has continued to increase.

- There has been a degree of heterogeneity in the antigenicity of the A(H3) viruses this season and an imperfect fit with the A(H3) component in the seasonal vaccine.

- Since week 40/2011, a total of 1513 SARI cases, including 79 fatalities, have been reported by seven countries. Of these cases, most were influenza-related.

- No resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir) has been reported so far this season.

The decrease in the proportion of influenza-positive sentinel specimens and the growing number of countries reporting continuously decreasing trends in ILI/ARI notifications indicate that the epidemic has passed its peak in most European countries. As often observed late in the season, the proportion of type B virus influenza detections has been increasing over the past 6 weeks.

Sentinel surveillance of influenza-like illness (ILI)/ acute respiratory infection (ARI): Medium or low intensity was indicated by all 28 reporting countries. For more detailed information, go to: http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/120330_SUR_Weekly_Influenza_Surveillance_Overview.pdf.

Virological surveillance: Of 403 sentinel specimens testing positive for influenza virus, 303 (75.2 percent) were type A and 100 (24.8 percent) type B. For more detailed information, go to: http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/120330_SUR_Weekly_Influenza_Surveillance_Overview.pdf.

[3] USA (DE) - Tamiflu resistance

Antiviral-resistant flu confirmed in Delaware
---------------------------------------------
Delaware's Division of Public Health (DPH) identified an antiviral-resistant influenza case on 19 Mar 2012 in a one-year-old child from New Castle County. The child was hospitalized and has fully recovered. This is Delaware's 1st known case of influenza resistant to oseltamivir (brand name Tamiflu) for the current flu season.

The case, which is still under investigation, tested positive for influenza A/H1N1 in mid-February. The specimen was part of a random sample submitted for routine anti-viral resistance testing.

"Random sampling is done routinely to determine levels of antiviral resistance," said Dr. Karyl Rattay, Director of the Delaware Division of Public Health (DPH). "Of 21 Delaware samples tested for resistance from 23 Nov 2011, to 12 Mar 2012, only this one case has been found to be anti-viral resistant."

The antibiotic oseltamivir is the preferred treatment for confirmed cases of influenza. Resistance to oseltamivir is very rare and only 0.5 percent of samples tested by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) this season have been found to be oseltamivir-resistant. There is no reason for medical providers to change treatment approaches at this time.

[Reports of neuraminidase-resistance have been rare overall, and as reported above, none from the European region this season. Overall the WHO global survey less optimistic than the European regional surrey in assessment of the current influenza situation, but it is clear that no new humans strains of enhanced pathogenicity have made an appearance this season in the northern hemisphere. - Mod.CP]
