INFLUENZAVIRUSES, POSSIBLE WILD BIRD RESERVOIRS
***********************************************
A ProMED-mail post

From: Merritt Clifton <anmlpepl@whidbey.com>

Our colleague Carroll Cox of EnviroWatch, formerly of the U.S. Fish &
Wildlife Service, just faxed us 35 pages of bird migration maps showing how
various migratory birds who spend winters in the general vicinity of Hong
Kong and the populated parts of North America congregate together in
Arctic, Canadian, and Siberian habitat each summer.
Carroll's point is that if there was a new strain of avian flu around last
spring in the rice paddies around Hong Kong where domestic fowl are often
kept, it may already have been transmitted into various migratory bird
populations, which may or may not have resistance to it. It is possible
that migratory birds may be immune carriers.
Meanwhile, if this is the case, killing off the poultry in Hong Kong won't
halt the transmission--and wiping out the wildlife populations with
potential exposure probably wouldn't be possible even if someone were to
try it. But Carroll's data does again raise the question whether this
avian flu came from a wildlife population in the first place, probably of a
species which normally has little infectious contact with either domestic
poultry or humans.
