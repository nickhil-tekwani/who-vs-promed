Mainland China Anhui and Hunan recently added 4 cases of confirmed H9N2 flu: aged 1 to 15 years; 3 female, 1 male; date of onset between year 4 to 10 months; are mild; 1 case joined the family name to the market to buy food; no live poultry; remaining exposure history or exposure history is unknown.

Since 2013 the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong cumulative total of H9N2 flu cases is 6, including Hunan (4), Anhui (1) and Hong Kong (1 patient) (Guangdong Province moved). Currently tourism against human bird flu epidemic proposal, mainland China, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Anhui and Hunan Provincial Tourism epidemic proposal as a warning (Alert), other provinces (excluding Hong Kong and Macao) as a note (Watch).

The Disease Programme called people not to [underestimate] the severity of influenza, [and] should routinely wash their hands [and observe] good respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette; [visitors to] mainland China should avoid contact with live poultry [and] markets; chickens, ducks, geese and eggs [should be cooked properly] to avoid infection. [Those suffering] fever or flu-like symptoms should wear a mask [and] as soon as possible [seek] medical treatment. [They should provide physicians with their] travel and contact history, [take] medication according to doctor's orders, [and remain] at home [while] recuperating.

[H9N2 avian influenza A viruses have caused multiple human infections since their introduction into land-based birds in 1988. The virus is endemic in domestic poultry in Eurasia. The H9N2 influenza subtype has been evolving and acquiring characteristics that raise concerns that it may become more transmissible among humans. Mechanisms that allow infection and subsequent human-to-human transmission of avian influenza viruses are not well understood.

From Public Library of Science. "Pandemic Potential Of H9N2 Avian Influenza Viruses." ScienceDaily. 14 Aug 2008. <www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/08/080812213818.htm>.

Recent human infections with avian inï¬‚uenza virus revealed that H9N2 is the gene donor for H7N9 and H10N8 viruses that are infecting humans. The crucial role of H9N2 viruses at the animal-human interface is due to the wide host range, adaptation to both poultry and mammals and extensive gene reassortment. In China, which is regarded as an epicenter of avian influenza viruses, the H9N2 virus has been detected in multiple avian species, including chicken, duck, quail, pheasant, partridge, pigeon, silky chicken, chukar and egret.
