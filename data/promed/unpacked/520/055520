[Tianjin, in northeast China (see the map in the source URL), has become China's 9th ASF-infected province. Since the 1st official confirmation and reporting of ASF in China, dated 3 Aug 2018, ASF has been detected in domestic pigs in 38 villages, the smallest available admin units in 9 main administrative regions, namely 8 provinces and an autonomous region. These are the provinces Anhui, Heilongjiang, Henan, Jilin, Jiangsu, Liaoning, Tianjin and Zhejiang, plus the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. More than 160 000 pigs have been culled in an effort to halt further spread.

Actions taken by China: closing of live pig markets in infected provinces and prohibiting the movement of live pig and pork products from infected provinces. The government set a 3 km (1.86 miles) "epidemic zone" and a 10 km (6.21 miles) "buffer zone" around the epidemic zones. All pigs in holdings confirmed as infected are culled (stamping out policy) against compensation.

The movement control measures, applied in epidemic zones, are lifted, liable to assessment, if no additional cases are detected therein during the following 6 weeks. This policy has been recently applied in Yueqing City, Zhejiang Province, where, on 10 Oct 2018, the movement control was lifted since there was no further detection for 6 weeks after culling of pigs within the epidemic zone (http://www.moa.gov.cn/gk/yjgl_1/yjcl/201810/t20181010_6160460.htm).

China reports to the OIE relate to each affected province as a separate event; hence, there are currently 9 ASF threads.
