On 27 Sep 2005 Quebec public authorities received a ProMED-mail alert
informing them that several French hunters had contracted trichinellosis
after consuming black bear meat in the course of a hunting trip to Northern
Quebec.
We subsequently contacted the French authorities to learn more about the
situation.
Epidemiological investigation in France
---------------------------------------
An epidemiological investigation conducted by a team in France(1) uncovered
the following facts: on 22 Sep 2005, the Institut de Veille Sanitaire in
France was notified that 5 related patients had been hospitalized with
fever, myalgia, and hypereosinophilia. These 5 individuals had shared a
meal 15 days earlier that included bear meat brought back by one of the
group following a hunting trip to Canada. The latter had been part of group
of 10 hunters who ate bear meat in Canada; some members of the group also
brought bear meat into France.
The epidemiological investigation carried out in France revealed that the
hunters had eaten bear meat in the course of their hunting trip in Northern
Quebec. All of the French subjects who were part of the hunting party that
travelled to Quebec, as well as all subjects later exposed to Canadian bear
meat in France, were identified. An alert was issued to the French network
of 35 hospital parasitologists participating in the annual survey of the
Centre National de Reference (CNR), as well as to the private laboratories
(Biomerieux, Cerba, LCL) that also form part of this network. Subjects who
had been exposed to the meat but had not yet become ill at the time of the
investigation were referred to their attending physicians. The CNR urged
all of them to undergo systematic biological testing and preventive treatment.
The complete epidemiological investigation revealed that different groups
had been exposed to the black bear meat. The exposed population comprised
25 individuals who fell into 3 groups: the initial group of 10 hunters who
returned from Canada; a 2nd group of 6 guests in the Orleans region
(Loiret) who (along with 3 of the hunters) ate a meal that included bear
meat; and a 3rd group of 9 individuals in the Narbonne region (Aude) who
(along with one of the hunters), ate meat from the same animal.
In October 2005, 17 cases of trichinellosis were identified (in persons
aged 31 to 67, including 13 men and 4 women). This corresponds to an
overall disease rate of 68 per cent (M: 87 per cent, W: 40 per cent). The
cases manifested between 9 and 29 Sep 2005. Incubation periods ranged
between 7 and 24 days (mean: 18 days). Two muscle biopsies were performed
on one of the hunters and one of the dinner guests. These biopsies revealed
a parasite load of at least 2 larvae per gram of muscle. Eight of these
individuals were hospitalized for an average of 10 days. No serious form of
the disease was observed.
Analyses carried out on the trichinella larvae revealed that the species in
question was _T. nativa_, which is far more resistant to freezing than the
_T. spiralis_ species.
Treatment with Albendazole at doses ranging between 400 and 800 mg/day was
commenced for all cases and for all exposed subjects 20 to 28 days after
exposure. Among the Narbonne dinner guests, most of whom received
preventive treatment, only 1/3 presented symptoms.
The black bear in question was killed on 26 Aug 2005, in Northern Quebec
(57 deg N and 65 deg W), in a tundra area near the George River. The animal
was skinned, eviscerated, and cut up on site. The 4 legs, filets, trophy,
skin and various edible viscera, including the tongue, were brought back to
the hunting camp. The meat was hung under cover for 3 to 4 days. The
hunters ate some of the meat on several occasions during the period of 28
and 30 Aug 2005, sometimes as stew in the local style, other times as
lightly done or rare steaks. Some in the group went so far as to taste the
meat raw. The tongue was eaten well-done. The various members of the group,
with the exception of the guide, returned to France on 2 Sep 2005. Two of
them brought back pieces of bear meat in their luggage, despite statutory
prohibitions against this practice. One group of guests ate some of the
meat on the evening of 2 Sep, upon the hunters' return, while the other
group of guests consumed the meat on 6 Sep, after it had been frozen for 3
days. Both groups consumed the meat in the form of steaks at varying
degrees of doneness, based on individual taste. Amounts consumed ranged
from a single bite to about 100 g. All of the meat brought into France was
consumed.
The Centre National de Recherche has had discussions with the Direction
Generale de la Sante regarding an information notice that will be forwarded
to all hunting federations, informing them of the hazards of consuming
underdone bear meat and reminding them of the prohibitions against the
importation of meats.
Quebec investigation conducted by investigators of the ministere de
l'Agriculture, des Pecheries et de l'Alimentation (MAPAQ)
--------------------------------------
MAPAQ investigators contacted the outfitter implicated in this matter, in
order to determine whether he and his team of guides were well-informed
about the risks of contracting trichinellosis from underdone bear meat. A
representative for the outfitter explained that French tourists like to
come to Quebec on the "European plan", which commonly provides a Quebecois
guide for every group of 6-12 hunters. The guide is responsible for
ensuring the group's safety and maintaining the camp. However, the outings
are based on the forest survival concept whereby participants must prepare
their own food. This differs from the American plan, where there is a guide
for every 2 clients and clients are accompanied at all times by their guide
and a cook who prepares their meals.
The outfitter receives about 30 clients per year for bear hunting and 3/4
of these clients are usually nonresidents who come from different parts of
the world. It would appear that French tourists show the keenest interest
in bear hunting. While they primarily hunt caribou, they are also very
partial to black bear hunting, unlike Americans who mostly hunt caribou. It
would appear that hunters seldom bring back bear meat, preferring to eat it
in the wild (if at all).
According to the representative for the outfitter, these are the 1st cases
of trichinellosis the company has been associated with in 20 years. In
2005, 11 bears were killed during the outfitter's period of operation: 3 by
French tourists, 6 by American tourists, 2 by Slovak tourists, and one by a
Quebecois hunter. Based on information obtained from the outfitter, it
would seem that the French are particularly fond of bear meat, although
they are aware that the meat must be consumed well-done.
As for the group of hunters who contracted trichinellosis in September
2005, they hunted and consumed black bear in Northern Quebec. They were
accompanied by a French guide and a Quebecois guide. The Quebecois guide
accompanied the group for 3 days only. The French guide, who sells these
trips in France, accompanied the participants throughout their stay in
Quebec. It would seem that the guide was aware that the meat needed to be
cooked thoroughly, although he himself ate meat that was underdone. The
representative for the outfitter, who accompanied the group for 3 days, has
stated that the group ate the food they caught hunting and fishing. They
fished, hunted and liked to survive solely on what they hunted and fished.
Since participants were responsible for cooking their own food, they were
free to prepare the meat as they saw fit; in this instance, the meat was
eaten rare. It is important to note, however, that no print information on
trichinellosis is currently provided to outfitters, guides, and hunters.
A box of the meat in question was shipped to Schefferville and then to
Montreal, as a gift to an Aboriginal person, who gave some to 2 other
people as gifts. On 12 Oct 2006, this person was informed that the meat was
infected. As the meat had not been consumed, it was sampled for analysis.
The tests performed by the Laboratoire d'Epidemiosurveillance Animale du
Quebec revealed the presence of about 300 larvae per gram of meat. The
larvae were sent to the International Trichinella Reference Centre
(Laboratory of Parasitology, Istituto Superiore di Sanita viale Regina,
Rome, Italy) for species identification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
Discussion
----------
_Trichinella sp._ is a parasite found in Quebec, primarily in predators
such as polar bears, wolves, foxes, and, surprisingly, the seals of Hudson
Bay and Hudson Straits. Black bears, which occasionally consume animal
carcasses or act as predators, can also carry the infection. In Quebec, it
is estimated that less than 1.5 per cent of black bears south of the 50th
parallel are infected (2). No study of the prevalence of this parasite in
black bears north of the 50th parallel has been conducted, although Butler
and Khan3 have reported a prevalence rate of 1 per cent in Labrador, which
suggests that the prevalence of this parasite in black bears may be similar
throughout Quebec.
Interventions in Quebec since the outbreak
------------------------------------------
Meetings were organized between Quebec outfitters and officials of the
ministere des Ressources Naturelles et de la Faune (MRNF) and MAPAQ.
Information on trichinellosis was passed on to participants.
MAPAQ is coordinating the production of a brochure that discusses the risk
of contracting trichinellosis from underdone black bear meat and outlines a
number of preventive measures. This brochure will be distributed by MRNF to
outfitters, wildlife preserves and hunters in Quebec. The information will
also be made available on the internet sites of MRNF, MAPAQ and MSSS.
