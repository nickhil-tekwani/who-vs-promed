State agriculture department officials and cold storage owners today
insisted that despite drastic fall in potato production, prices will not
[increase] much. Due to incessant rain in February [2007], late blight had
reduced potato production to 48 lakh ton from the projected 90 lakh ton
this year. It is 30 per cent lower than last year's production of 72 lakh
ton. So, potato prices are relatively high this year [2007].
The Cold Storage Association president, Mr Sant Kumar Tibrewal, said, "Cold
storages in the state have recorded 10 per cent reduction in potato
collection." State agriculture department officials said the potato stock
is enough to fulfill the demand of 32 lakh ton a year in the state.
Agriculture marketing director Mr T Biswas said, "Prices in the coming
months will depend on the supply from south India where potato cultivation
starts in late August. There will be a huge scarcity if the production is
hampered," he said. Fog, cloud, and rain at the onset of potato harvest are
a threat.

[A 'lakh' is a unit in the Indian numbering system, widely used both in
official and in other contexts in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and
Pakistan. One 'lakh' is equal to a hundred thousand. A hundred 'lakhs' make
a 'crore' or ten million. The word is particularly notable because it is
used almost exclusively in English articles written for Indian audiences
(as opposed to writing "hundred thousand"). - CopyEd.MJ]

[2] Blight monitoring service launched

Potato growers can now be alerted to confirmed local blight outbreaks and
Smith Periods [weather patterns used to predict the risk of blight
outbreaks (see link below) - Mod.DHA], after the launch of the British
Potato Council's (BPC) new combined Fight Against Blight (FAB) and
Blightwatch service.
Once registered at either the British Potato Council at
<http://www.potato.org.uk/blight> or Blightwatch at
<http://www.blightwatch.co.uk>, users can receive free alerts via e-mail or
SMS for up to 10 UK postcodes.
This will allow fungicide programmes to be better tailored to actual blight
risk, says BPC agronomist Mark Prentice. "Early warning is a crucial part
of keeping this devastating disease under control and reducing the annual
BPS 20m (USD 39.8m) fungicide bill growers pay."
There have already been a couple of blight outbreaks in crops under
polythene in the south west and a number of Smith Periods have also been
recorded, he says. "We don't tend to get much traditional blight until most
crops are through. Not many are yet and there's not much inoculum about
[due to the dry weather], but it's early days, so there is no need to take
your eye off the ball."
Mr Prentice urges growers to stay alert for signs of the disease and
control any volunteer potatoes or growth on outgrade piles.
A new set of BPC trials aims to improve blight control by more effectively
targeting fungicide doses and timings. The trials will test how blight
develops on 3 varieties with different resistance ratings, under a range of
fungicide programmes.
Symphonia, which has good resistance, Maris Piper (moderate), and Shepody
(susceptible) will be tested using spray programmes containing different
rates of Dithane (mancozeb), Shirlan (fluazinam), and Infinito
(fluopicolide) at 7 and 10 day intervals.
"The products we have chosen represent the 3 new Europe-wide star ratings
that fungicides are given -- a standard that reflects their effectiveness
and mode of action," explains BPC's Rob Clayton. They also represent a
range of costs, which will be built into the results, he notes.

[3] Potato blight fungus (_Phytophthora infestans_)
Date: Wed 9 May 2007

<http://www.olympusmicro.com/micd/galleries/brightfield/potatoblight.html>

Potato late blight, caused by the fungus _Phytophthora infestans_, is one
of the most important potato diseases in the world. It was responsible for
the great Irish potato famine of the 1840s, which left over 1 million
people dead from famine-related diseases and resulted in the exodus of more
than 1.5 million people from Ireland.
Native to South America and cultivated by Native Americans for thousands of
years, the potato plant was introduced to Europe by the Spaniards in the
mid-1500s. Although it was probably already carrying milder forms of the
late blight fungus, it was not until 1844 that the virulent strain
(speculated to be a single clonal genotype of _P. infestans_) arrived in
Ostend, Belgium, via a shipment of infected seed potatoes from the United
States. Within 2 years, potato crops in continental Europe, as well as in
Ireland, were ravaged.
Disease outbreaks are caused by vegetative reproduction (self-cloning) of
the fungus and require cool temperatures and moist conditions. Controlling
the fungus is difficult because it has a complicated life cycle with
distinct and strikingly different spore forms, ranging from motile
zoospores (produced by self-cloning) to thick-walled oospores (produced by
sexual reproduction). As occurred in 1845 in Ireland, blight can overwinter
in unharvested potatoes and release its airborne spores the next season as
the new potato stalks grow.
With the emergence of a new strain in the United States during the 1990s,
late blight continues to be a looming threat to the world's potato crops.
The new strain is virulent and remarkably destructive, devastating
apparently healthy potato fields within days. Within hours after the fungus
contacts a healthy plant, normal potato plant leaves can be transformed
into badly damaged leaves. The recent strain reproduces under lower
humidity, making it a threat to potato crops in more arid regions, such as
the high mountain valleys of Colorado and Idaho. Prevention through seed
piece treatment with fungicides and destruction of cull piles appear to be
feasible prevention measures for this economically-devastating fungus,
which can overwinter on other hosts such as the bittersweet and hairy
nightshade.

[_P. infestans_ can also affect other solanaceous crops such as tomato or
eggplant. Considerable variation in aggressiveness between different fungal
isolates has been observed.
The report of a 50 per cent crop loss from India is a reminder of the
constant threat of potato late blight worldwide. Unfortunately, the latest
technology as employed in the UK to support local growers, is not available
for all!
There is a second potato leaf blight called 'early blight', which is caused
by the fungus _Alternaria solani_.
