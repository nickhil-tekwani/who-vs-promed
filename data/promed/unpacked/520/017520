Kentucky health officials have taken action to close a 240-acre [about 97 ha] field trial facility in Butler county near Morgantown. The move comes after officials say a captive wild rabbit there tested positive for tularemia. The disease, also known as "rabbit fever," is transmissible to people and pets. It can even be fatal if left untreated. Health officials are encouraging people who spend time outside in Butler county to guard against exposure to the bacterial disease.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends using insect repellent, wearing long pants and sleeves, removing any ticks, and avoiding drinking untreated surface water. Anyone who suspects they have come into contact with the bacteria should seek medical care.

[I very much doubt that this captive rabbit was in this field by accident. It is probably that the Kentucky department of health had their suspicions about this field and penned this rabbit and others to check whether the ticks in this field were infected. But I suspect that they will still have to collect ticks, identify them, and check for _ Francisella tularensis_, but that's what graduate students are for.

From the San Diego County Department of Health
https://www.sandiegocounty.gov/content/sdc/deh/pests/tularemia.html:

"Tularemia, also known as rabbit fever, is caused by the bacterium _Francisella tularensis_. This bacterium is found in wild rodents and rabbits. It is spread through tick bites, direct contact with infected living or dead animals, or by drinking water that has been contaminated with the bacteria. In California, the American dog tick and the Pacific Coast tick can transmit tularemia. Tularemia has been reported in many areas of the country. In California, it is most frequently seen in the northern areas of the state. It is very rare in San Diego."

Although more common in Midwestern US states, the history of tularemia actually starts in California where, in Tulare county, the disease was characterized as a plague-like disease in the California ground squirrel by McCoy and Chapin (1) in 1912. Initially called _Bacterium tularensis_, the organism's genus was changed to _Francisella_ for Edward Francis (2) who published in 1919 that "deer fly fever", "rabbit septicemia" and the "plague-like disease of ground squirrels" were all the same disease.
