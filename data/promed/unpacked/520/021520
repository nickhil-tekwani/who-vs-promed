Norwalk Virus Outbreak in Homes for the Elderly in Calgary
----------------------------------------------------------
Health officials said on Wed 20 Dec 2000 that 7 homes for care of the
elderly in Calgary have been hit by a viral outbreak, which now appears to
be under control.
Nearly 600 residents and staff have fallen ill with the stomach bug, known
as Norwalk virus, since the end of last month. An administrator at Bow
View Manor said most residents and staffers were [affected by the virus at
some point, but added there are now less than 10 cases in the 245-bed
facility. There are signs the outbreak is ebbing in the other affected
care centres, but there's no way of forecasting whether it will pop up
elsewhere, said Dr. Judy MacDonald, the Calgary Region's Deputy Medical
Officer of Health.
Though common, the virus -- which causes nausea, vomiting and diarrhea --
poses a threat to people with a compromised immune system or other medical
problems. Elderly people are especially vulnerable to the virus, although
MacDonald said it's difficult to say whether it caused any deaths. "People
may have had symptoms of this infection, and died of their underlying
medical condition -- it is unlikely Norwalk virus [infection precipitated
their death."
The virus is spread by hand-to-mouth contact and officials have tried to
get it under control by stressing hand washing.

[The Norwalk viruses are associated with epidemic gastroenteritis in
humans. These viruses in the past were referred to as "small round
structured viruses." They are now classified as a group of species
constituting a distinct genus of the family _Caliciviridae_. These viruses
are considered to be the most important cause of epidemic non-bacterial
gastroenteritis worldwide. They have been associated both with outbreaks
in semi-closed communities (as in the present case) or community-wide
outbreaks (as in Norwalk, Ohio). Outbreaks are promoted by
person-to-person spread, and can be contained by attention to personal
hygiene as in the present case. However, the simultaneous involvement of a
number of separate care homes in Calgary suggests a common unidentified
source of infection. - Mod.CP
