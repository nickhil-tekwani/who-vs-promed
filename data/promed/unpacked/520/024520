A South African civil engineer has become the 3rd person to die in an
outbreak of Lassa fever in northern Sierra Leone, a health ministry
official said on Thursday [11 Nov 2010].

While the acute viral haemorrhagic fever causes some 5000 deaths annually
in west Africa, according to World Health Organization figures, it has
usually only affected the eastern part of Sierra Leone, and this case has
sparked fears the disease may be spreading.

"The death of the South African shows the active infection rate of the
Lassa fever virus in the district and brings to 3 the number who have now
died," said Amara Jambai of the ministry's disease prevention and control
directorate.

The South African civil engineer, who worked for the Geneva-based
bio-energy company Addax, died on Wednesday [10 Nov 2010] after contracting
the virus in September [2010].

"Lassa fever cases in Makeni are worrying because the area has not known of
any prevalence of the disease in recent times, and the disease is very
infectious, and its case fatality [rate] is always high," said Jambai.

Lassa fever was identified in the northern Nigerian village of Lassa in
1969 and is endemic in parts of west Africa, including Liberia, Guinea and
Senegal. The virus is spread through contact with rat urine or faeces and
later between humans through contact with bodily secretions.

Two people died in October [2010] in Makeni, including a woman (who ran a
restaurant selling rat meat) and her 6 year old son.

Of the 153 cases recorded nationwide in the 1st 10 months of the year, 48
people have died, according to health officials.

[This report records another fatal case of Lassa fever in the vicinity of
the village of Makeni in northern Sierra Leone. Readers are referred to the
proceeding reports in this thread for details of the outbreak. It seems
likely that the South African civil engineer came into contact with
_Mastomys_ rodents or their excreta during the course of his employment and
tragically died.

About 80 per cent of human infections are asymptomatic; the remaining cases
have severe multisystem disease, where the virus affects several organs in
the body, such as the liver, spleen, and kidneys. The incubation period of
Lassa fever ranges from 6-21 days. Further information can be obtained at
<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs179/en/index.html>.
