Shanghai has reported 2 more cases of human infection of a new strain of bird flu [avian influenza virus infection], raising the number of cases in eastern China to 18. 6 of the people who contracted the virus have died.

Health officials believe people are contracting the H7N9 [avian influenza] virus through direct contact with infected fowl and say there's no evidence the virus is spreading easily between people.

Shanghai's government said Saturday [6 Apr 2013] the latest victims are a 74-year-old peasant and a 66-year-old retiree. The city has been ordered by the agriculture ministry to halt its live poultry trade and slaughter all fowl in markets where the virus has been found.
