Just to follow up on this useful WHO comment, ProMED-mail readers
will be aware that this debate about assessing the true comparative
clinical severity of the recent pandemic A/H1N1/2009 vs seasonal
influenza (1-3) and even questions concerning the true mortality of
the 1918 pandemic (4-8) has been ongoing for sometime. This will
always be difficult to resolve unless contemporary seasonal influenza
cases are investigated and followed up in the same way as the more
recent pandemic influenza A/H1N1/2009 cases. Yet, outside of a
pandemic setting (except, perhaps in some pediatric units) seasonal
influenza infections are rarely investigated and followed up so
comprehensively.

There was a short window of opportunity to do this during the earlier
phases of the pandemic (for example during April-May 2009), in
countries where influenza surveillance/clinical follow up was
heightened in response to news of the pandemic from the Americas, but
before the pandemic virus actually arrived there in full force, such
as in some Southeast Asian countries (including places like Hong Kong
and Singapore) and perhaps, Australasia. In this situation, the
seasonal influenza viruses were still circulating in the population,
but sampling and testing for influenza viruses may well have been
enhanced in order to catch the 1st case' of the pandemic virus
arriving in these countries.

Otherwise, as previously debated and stated in the WHO comments
below, there is an imbalance between the data available to compare
the severity of illness between seasonal and pandemic influenza
infections, simply because most adult clinical teams rarely request
laboratory diagnostic tests for respiratory viruses (including
influenza) and therefore cannot assign any contribution of such viral
infections to any subsequent severe clinical illness. Again,
pediatric teams are often better at this because respiratory viral
infections at this younger age may be more severe in the absence of
any previous exposure and therefore pre-existing immunity.

The comments under 'Estimates using all-cause mortality' and
'Laboratory-confirmed deaths' are interesting and seem to be flip
sides of the same coin. However, a question that emerges from this
is: how much of a contribution does influenza infection have to make
to allow it to be assigned to the actual cause of death? Yet, this
contribution may be given different weights depending on who
completes the death certificate.

For example, an elderly patient with advanced long-term heart failure
and/or diabetes and/or cancer, who then gets infected with influenza,
may succumb to complications of these pre-existing conditions with or
without typical signs of viral or secondary bacterial pneumonia. When
completing the death certificate, an infectious disease physician may
put influenza as the cause of death with contributions from these
chronic conditions -- if a diagnostic test for influenza was
performed and found to be positive, which he/she may have requested,
directly. Yet a cardiologist, endocrinologist, or oncologist
completing the death certificate may put these pre-existing chronic
conditions as the cause of death with influenza being only
contributory, especially if no diagnostic testing for influenza was
even requested. This will depend on which physician is on duty and/or
responsible for the patient at the time of death, and such
regulations will vary between countries.

I am in general agreement with the WHO briefing note. It is important
to recognize also that when a pandemic virus like pandemic influenza
(H1N1) 2009 virus has an atypical pattern of occurrence relative to
time, such as one or more recurrent spring/summer/fall waves, it
complicates assessment of extra influenza-related mortalities because
the 'rest of the year' picture is complicated relative to the one
that usually prevails for strictly seasonal influenza.

Also it is very important not to lose sight of the fact that
'mortality' is far from the only significant adverse impact of any
highly infectious disease like influenza. Unfortunately, direct
objective measurement of these other adverse impacts is usually far
more complicated and difficult than measurement of mortalities. The
popular media often tends to bias its considerations towards the more
visibly extreme outcomes (mortalities) and the simpler things that
can be more readily and widely grasped by the 'public'.
