Maxmen A. Two Ebola drugs show promise amid ongoing outbreak. Nature. 12 Aug 2019. doi: 10.1038/d41586-019-02442-6; https://tinyurl.com/y62voqn9

People who receive either therapy soon after infection have a 90% survival rate, according to data from a clinical trial in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
-------------------
Two Ebola drugs have proven so effective in a clinical trial that researchers will make the treatments available to anyone infected with the virus in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where Ebola has killed nearly 1900 people over the past year.

The survival rate for people who received either drug shortly after infection, when levels of the virus in their blood were low, was 90%.

"It's really good news," says Sabue Mulangu, an infectious-disease researcher at the National Institute for Biomedical Research (INRB) in Kinshasa in the DRC, and an investigator on the trial. "Now we will be able to stress to people that more than 90% of people survive if they come into the [Ebola treatment unit] early and get this treatment."

One of the drugs, REGN-EB3, is a cocktail of 3 monoclonal antibodies against Ebola made by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals of Tarrytown, New York. The 2nd, mAB114, is derived from a single antibody recovered from the blood of a person who survived Ebola in the DRC in 1995 and was developed by the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).

Both drugs outperformed 2 other experimental treatments in the unprecedented multi-drug clinical trial in the DRC, the World Health Organization, INRB and NIAID said in a joint statement on 12 Aug 2019. Preliminary data from the 1st 499 people enrolled in the study show that 29% of people given REGN-EB3 died, compared with 34% of those who received mAb114.

By contrast, 53% of patients who received the anti-viral drug remdesivir died, as did 49% of those who received ZMapp, an antibody treatment that was tested during a major Ebola outbreak in West Africa from 2014-2016.

Jean-Jacques Muyembe Tamfum, the director-general of the INRB and a co-discoverer of Ebola, says he hopes the results inspire people to bring their sick loved ones to Ebola clinics for treatment. According to the WHO, people are waiting an average of 5-6 days after they notice the 1st symptoms of infection to seek treatment at an Ebola centre.

The outbreak in the eastern DRC is the 2nd-worst ever; more than 2800 people have been infected with Ebola, including the nearly 1900 who have died. Distrust and violence in the area have hampered efforts to halt the virus's spread.

The drug trial, which launched last November 2018, has a unique design that allows it to stop and restart if attacks near Ebola centres impede treatment, or if the outbreak ends. Researchers will continue to collect trial data on REGN-EB3 and mAB114 in the hopes of seeking regulatory approval.

"I'm in awe about what seemed to be an impossible clinical trial to run," says Sumathi Sivapalasingam, a senior director at Regeneron. "The team did this in such a complex emergency and still, the data quality is exceptional."

[Greg Folkers Retweeted Kai Kupferschmidt@kakape:
This is a great story on the trial of experimental Ebola treatments whose results we are all getting so excited about today. Amy [Maxmen] is one of the few journalists who has actually gone to North Kivu to report on this outbreak, a dangerous and critically important job!

Amy Maxmen@amymaxmen:
This #Ebola trial in #DRC is absolutely remarkable. It's scientifically rigorous but also adaptable. If an attack happens nearby, frontline responders alter protocols. If you missed it, I wrote about the unprecedented process of doing science in a warzone: Maxmen A.

[This report goes more thoroughly into the background of the 4 drugs tested in the clinical trial.

Community trust still remains a serious barrier to success. Will the community accept the safety and need for early treatment with these therapeutics? And with termination of the clinical trial where the treatment was free of charge, what will the cost be to the patient, and can they afford it? So while this news is indeed exciting, the drugs alone are not going to be a cure all until the community is on board with it.

As stated in the report cited above, challenges remain daunting. "I think the news today is fantastic. It gives us a new tool in our toolbox against Ebola," says Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO's Health Emergencies Programme. "But it doesn't stop Ebola. What will stop Ebola, under professor Muyembe's leadership and that of the government of the DRC, is good surveillance, good infection prevention and control, good community engagement, excellent vaccinations, and the use of these therapeutics in the most effective way possible." - Mod.LK]

At the Great Barrier Goma, access control on Rwandan territory is harsher
-------------------------
Restrictions on entry into Rwanda by the Goma-Gisenyi border post have been strengthened. Last week, Rwandan and Congolese citizens living in Gisenyi either experienced difficulties or were prevented from entering Rwanda or the DRC.

On Sun 11 Aug 2019, even some international officials paid for these measures.

A Beninese resident in Goma, an international civil servant in an organization active in North Kivu province, was prevented from entering Rwanda where he was driving his children for health care. He states that he "no longer understands this tightening of entry measures in Rwanda, whereas, according to him, Rwandan immigration services are relatively comprehensive when it comes to international civil servants".

Hundreds of travelers suffered the same fate on Sun [11 Aug 2019] at the border between Rwanda and the DRC.

Last week, several Congolese living in Gisenyi declared that they lived "[in] stress" with the strict filtering of entrances and exits at the 2 border posts between Gisenyi and Goma. Some even had to decide to move back to Goma, a city they left for security reasons or more attractive rents on the Rwandan side.

In its recommendations, by declaring Ebola in the DRC an epidemic of international emergency, WHO had nevertheless recommended to the national authorities of border states not to use it to hinder migratory movements in the region.

DRC-Ebola: protest against the response teams reported in Goma
----------------
A strong tension is being observed, Tue 13 Aug 2019, in the district Majengo, in the municipality of Karisimbi, north of Goma. At the base, some angry residents are protesting the arrival of a response team at a clinic where a woman who came from Kiwanja, in Rutshuru territory, died.

"Young people barricaded the road from the entrance, Three Lamps to Majengo, before reaching Buhene. They attacked any Land Cruiser thinking they had teams on board. They say that Ebola is a business imported from Beni-Butembo to Goma. Now, I have seen elements of the force of the order moving there, maybe to calm things down, "says a resident who is at the site of the demonstration.

"I heard a few shots," the same source added. The outbreak comes as 2 Ebola cases have been declared cured and have left the Ebola treatment center in Goma.

At his last press conference, before resigning from the Ministry of Health, Dr. Oly Ilunga demanded that tests be done on all the deaths that will be recorded in the city of Goma and about to prevent the spread of the disease. The city of Goma recorded its 1st case of Ebola on 14 Jul 2019.

Kuisma E. et al. Long-term wildlife mortality surveillance in northern Congo: a model for the detection of Ebola virus disease epizootics374Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B. http://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2018.0339 published 12 Aug 2019.

Abstract. Ebolavirus (EBOV) has caused disease outbreaks taking thousands of lives, costing billions of dollars in control efforts and threatening great ape populations. EBOV ecology is not fully understood but infected wildlife and consumption of animal carcasses have been linked to human outbreaks, especially in the Congo Basin. Partnering with the Congolese Ministry of Health, we conducted wildlife mortality surveillance and educational outreach in the northern Republic of Congo (RoC). Designed for EBOV detection and to alert public health authorities, we established a low-cost wildlife mortality reporting network covering 50 000 square km. Simultaneously, we delivered educational outreach promoting behavioural change to over 6600 people in rural northern RoC. We achieved specimen collection by training project staff on a safe sampling protocol and equipping geographically distributed bases with sampling kits. We established in-country diagnostics for EBOV testing, reducing diagnostic turnaround time to 3 days and demonstrated the absence of EBOV in 58 carcasses. Central Africa remains a high-risk EBOV region, but RoC, home to the largest remaining populations of great apes, has not had an epidemic since 2005. This effort continues to function as an untested early warning system in RoC, where people and great apes have died from past Ebola virus disease outbreaks.

This article is part of the theme issue "Dynamic and integrative approaches to understanding pathogen spillover."
