Dozens of Mecklenburg County children who came in contact with a rabid
puppy at a preschool and birthday parties are beginning treatment against
rabies, and health officials are urging anyone else who was licked,
scratched, or bitten by the puppy to call the county health department
immediately.
The 9-week-old border collie, owned by a family in Mint Hill, came in
contact with about 50 people before it was euthanized Monday. It is the
first case of rabies confirmed in a dog in Mecklenburg County since 1957.
The dog's owners, a couple with 2 children, could not be reached for
comment Thursday. But the family was to begin treatment to prevent rabies
Thursday, officials said.
The puppy was taken to a preschool show-and-tell and mingled with children
at 2 birthday parties, according to health officials.
"We really have adequate time to prevent rabies in any person who was
exposed," Mecklenburg County Medical Director Dr. Stephen Keener said at a
news conference.
"It is absolutely essential anyone exposed to this puppy's saliva get
preventive treatment immediately. There is a 3- to 8-week incubation period
for the disease in humans, so there's plenty of time to assess each child's
risk and take appropriate medical steps."
Health officials are taking action. They distributed leaflets door-to-door
in the Foxcrest neighborhood Thursday morning and they alerted the Health
Department of Rowan County, where the breeders of the puppy live. "They've
been working with our animal control officers, very closely and very
cooperatively, trying to get to the bottom of this," said Leonard Wood,
Rowan County public health director. "They're very saddened by this."
Wood said animal control officers had been in touch with owners of 3 other
dogs in the same litter and all are fine. Officers were expected to reach
the owners of the other 4 puppies in the litter by this morning, he said.
The Mecklenburg County health department is sending a nurse to the
preschool to answer questions and advise staff and parents of the 26
students there. The 4 staff members began treatment Thursday, said Kenny
Norwood, executive director of Christ Our Shepherd Ministries.
Treatment involves at least 6 injections in the arm, given over 28 days.
More injections are sometimes given near a wound, if the rabid animal has
broken its victim's skin. The cost typically ranges from $1500 to $2000 and
is often covered by insurance.
The dog began showing signs of rabies on 21 Feb 2001, 4 days after it made
an appearance at show-and-tell, said Al Piercy, epidemiology specialist for
Mecklenburg County. It was fearful, would run and hide, then become
aggressive and started snapping, Piercy said. A veterinarian examined the
dog then, but it became increasingly ill over the weekend.
Officials believe the puppy was infected the day before it left Rowan
County or the day after it arrived in Mint Hill. Tests will show what kind
of animal infected the dog. [Actually, it will show the strain, which is
presumptive of the species of origin. - Mod.TG]
North Carolina law says all dogs and cats must be vaccinated against rabies
at 4 months of age, and once every 3 years after that. In South Carolina,
owners have a choice of whether to vaccinate their pets every year or every
3 years. Despite rabies laws, only 48 percent of Mecklenburg County's dogs
and cats have up-to-date vaccinations, according to Denise Lambiotte of
Charlotte-Mecklenburg police animal control.
Still, rabies in pets is rare. Of the 459 cases in North Carolina in 2000,
8 involved cats and 4 involved dogs. Of the 181 cases last year in South
Carolina, 10 were in cats and none in dogs. Most cases are found in
raccoons, bats, foxes and skunks. But goats, cows, horses and groundhogs
have been infected, too.
Gaston County recorded the highest number of rabies cases in the state [of
North Carolina] for the last 2 years, with 32 cases in 1999 and 49 cases in
2000, according to state health officials. Dozens of people have reported
being attacked or exposed to rabid foxes, bats and raccoons there.
On 13 Jan [2001? 2000?] a fox repeatedly bit a 6-year-old on the knee as
she stood on her family's deck in southeast Gastonia. The girl's father
said he had to kick the fox to release its grip. In September, a
26-year-old mechanic was bitten on the neck by a rabid bat in his Lowell
garage. And in July, a rabid fox attacked 5 people in Gastonia.
Since July, Gaston County has spent about $23 000 on rabies shots for about
40 people who were bitten by rabid animals or came into contact with
potentially rabid animals. Gaston County picks up the tab for those who
don't have insurance.
"I think it's an epidemic," said Sgt. Larry Lingafelt with Gaston County
Animal Control. "Over the last few years, the numbers have grown a lot.
We're doing a lot more educational efforts trying to make people aware of
rabies and trying to get them to vaccinate their animals."
Peter Safir, director of the Mecklenburg County health department, urged
all owners to get their pets vaccinated. "We shouldn't have to go through
this problem," he said.

[Although law requires animals be vaccinated by 4 months of age, animals
have acquired rabies much earlier. Vaccination is essential to control this
disease. Documents indicate rabies virus was found in a skunk embryo. -
