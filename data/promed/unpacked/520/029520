From: Dr. Cheryl Massey

This is with reference to the West Nile virus (WNV) posting of 27 May
2007 regarding the dead crow found positive for West Nile virus in
York Region, Ontario, Canada. I am responsible for running the
laboratory that carries out West Nile virus surveillance on dead
corvids in Ontario, and I would like to make a clarification.
While it is true that the WNV-positive bird found in York Region was
found much earlier this year (found dead on 13 May 2007) than last
year in the same region (5 Aug 2006), it is not unusual for
WNV-positive birds to be found in May in Ontario. The first
WNV-positive corvid in Ontario last year was found dead on 15 May
2006, which is only 2 days' difference from this year. While we do
see sporadic cases of WNV-positive corvids in May, the peak in
frequency of positive corvids is seen in July and August, much like
in the states bordering the Great Lakes.

Human cases have been reported from:
State / Neuroinvasion* / *West Nile* fever** / Other*** / Total ****
/ Fatalities
Mississippi / 3 / 0/ 0 / 3 / 0
* Cases with neurologic manifestations (such as WN encephalitis,
meningitis* and myelitis)
** Cases with no evidence of neuroinvasion.
*** Cases for which insufficient clinical information was provided.
**** Total number of human cases of WNV illness reported to ArboNET
by state and local health departments.
Neuroinvasive Disease refers to severe disease cases, particularly
West Nile meningitis and West Nile encephalitis.
West Nile fever refers to typically less severe cases that show no
evidence of neuroinvasion.
West Nile fever is not currently on the list of nationally notifiable
diseases, and therefore it is optional whether or not state health
departments report these cases to CDC. Click the above CDC site [URL
above] for further explanations of neuroinvasive West Nile virus
disease and West Nile fever.
Other Clinical includes persons with clinical manifestations other
than WN fever, WN encephalitis or WN meningitis, such as acute
flaccid paralysis. Unspecified cases are those for which sufficient
clinical information was not provided.
Total Human Cases Reported to CDC: These numbers reflect both mild
and severe human disease cases occurring since 1 Jan 2006 reported to
ArboNet by state and local health departments.
ArboNet is the national, electronic surveillance system established
by CDC to assist states in tracking West Nile virus and other
mosquito-borne viruses. Information regarding 2006 virus/disease
activity is posted when such cases are reported to CDC.

2006 West Nile virus activity in the United States (through 17 Oct 2006)
-----------------------------------------------
Data are being collected from state and local health departments on a
weekly basis and are reported to the CDC ArboNET for the following 5
categories: wild birds, sentinel chicken flocks, human cases,
veterinary cases, and mosquito surveillance. Maps detailing
county-level wild birds, sentinel chicken flocks, human cases,
veterinary cases, and mosquito surveillance data are published each
week on the collaborative USGS/CDC West Nile virus website.
As of 17 Oct 2006, human, avian, animal or mosquito West Nile virus
(WNV) infections have been reported to CDC ArboNET from the following
states: California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Mississippi, and Texas.
WNV antibody-positive sentinel animals (birds and/or horses) have
been found in California, and Florida.
WNV equine infections have been reported from Alabama, Arizona,
Arkansas, California, and Texas.
WNV has been detected in dead wild birds in California and Mississippi.
WNV has been detected in mosquito pools collected in California,
Illinois, Indiana, and Texas.
