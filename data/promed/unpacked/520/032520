------------------------------------------------------------
(1) _Wuchereria bancroftiis_ (Wb) is responsible for the chronic condition elephantiasis in humans (as are _Brugia malayi_ and _B. timori_) rather than "elephantitis", which by definition would manifest as an unusual and disturbing inflammatory condition resulting in a greatly distended, swollen elephant -- etiology unknown (if it exists at all). Elephants are under enough pressure as it is. [This typographical error is being corrected. Mod.SH]

(2) Bancroftian filariasis is, in fact, both preventable and curable, provided we are talking about elimination of the worm by use of DEC [diethylcarbamazine] and albendazole. It may require several treatment rounds, but ultimately cure is achievable. However, the unfortunate pathology associated with elephantiasis can present real challenges, with generally non-reversible tissue damage requiring corrective surgery in the most severe and debilitating cases. _Mansonella perstans_, on the other hand, is not easily treated and apparently more refractory to the current available drugs (ivermectin, albendazole and diethylcarbamazine) normally used to treat most filarial infections.

(3) Regarding the pathological response to _M. perstans_ infections, although transient swelling can occur in some cases, this parasite does not result in elephantiasis. In fact, it appears the parasite is far less pathogenic than Wb and more generally asymptomatic in infected humans.

(4) Whether or not a rapid detection test is cross-reactive between the 2 nematode species, the more conventional diagnosis using standard microscopy for examination of Giemsa-stained blood for the presence of circulating microfilaria can easily confirm and differentiate between the 2 species. To the trained eye, the microfilaria of _M. perstans_ and _W. bancrofti_ are quite distinctive morphologically. Test limitations would be undetectable, extremely low-density microfilaremia or subpatent infections. The other inconvenience regarding Bancroftian filariasis would be having to typically collect blood samples in the evening hours.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Michael J Bangs for his comments. The word "elephantitis" was used by the newspaper, and we apologize for not correcting it before posting. The reason we used _Mansonella perstans_ was that the survey of filariasis in Zambia we referred to used an antigen-capture test, a so-called "rapid diagnostic test", which depended on the specificity of the reagents. Dr Bangs also points out that test sensitivity may be a problem; and it seems that the study missed an opportunity to compare microscopy with RDT. - Mod.EP
