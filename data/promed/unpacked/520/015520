_E. coli_ suspected in 5 seniors' deaths
--------------------------------------
Public health officials in Greater Toronto are fighting a drug-resistant
strain of _E. coli_ that has infected residents at 8 seniors' homes and may
have contributed to 5 deaths. At least 100 people have been infected with
the strain in Durham Region, with a further undetermined number in York
Region and Scarborough, said Dr Donna Reynolds, associate medical officer
of health for Durham Region. The largest outbreak of [infection with this
particular strain [ever reported in Canada was identified in several
patients admitted to a Durham hospital last July, according to Dr Reynolds.
Since then, 4 elderly people have died in Durham Region hospitals and one
in York Region from medical conditions that may have been complicated by
the strain of _E. coli_, said Reynolds. "Most people can fight off the
infection, but it can be extremely serious for the frail and elderly who
are suffering from other underlying illnesses." Reynolds declined to
identify the hospitals. She said these cases are completely different
[from the waterborne outbreak of _E. coli_ and campylobacter [infection
that hit Walkerton in May last year, causing at least 7 deaths and making
2000 residents ill.
This "new" strain is a variation of a common bacterium found in the
digestive tract that has developed a resistance to antibiotics, Reynolds
said. The culprit is thought to be extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL)
-- enzymes that bacteria can produce to resist a group of antibiotics used
to treat a wide range of infections. ESBL-induced _E. coli_ is found in the
human digestive tract and can be spread through feces either by
self-infection or direct contact with feces of an infected person.
Health officials have traced infected people, some [asymptomatic, over the
past year by investigating contacts of the original Durham patients. A
total of 8 seniors' facilities -- most of them in Durham -- have cases of
the resistant variety of _E. coli_, Reynolds said. The Scarborough cases
appear to have originated with Durham seniors who moved to Scarborough
seniors' homes over the last year. The exact origin of the York Region
cluster has not yet been determined, Reynolds said. First discovered in
Europe in 1983, the antibiotic-resistant form of _E. coli_ now is "quite
prevalent in the US but relatively unknown in Canada," Reynolds said. While
there have been sporadic cases in Canada, she said this is likely the
largest single cluster in this country and qualifies as an outbreak.
ESBL-induced _E. coli_ produce high levels of enzymes that can break down
powerful antibiotics often held in reserve for the sickest patients.
"Because of this, infection control and cleanliness are the major factors
in stopping its spread," said Reynolds.
In many of the 100 cases identified in Durham so far, the bacteria has not
caused any symptoms but has just "colonized" in the intestines meaning that
it is alive in the digestive tract. All of those who have tested positive
are being monitored closely and tested for the bacteria every 2 to 4 weeks.
No treatment is being given to those who show no symptoms for fear of
building up further antibiotic resistance. "If it is left to run its
course, it sometimes clears itself out of the system," Reynolds added.
Officials of all the seniors' facilities involved have been told to
exercise special precautions for cleanliness and infection control when
dealing with the infected people. All other residents are being tested.
