Some 28 students from Sacred Heart Mukumu Girls in Kakamega County have been hospitalised with fever and diarrhoea.

The students were reported to have been taken ill 3 days ago on suspicion of a malaria attack.

County Director of Health Dr William Olaka and health officers visited the school on Tuesday [24 May 2022].

In their preliminary findings, 9 students admitted to the nearby St Elizabeth Mukumu Mission Hospital tested positive for malaria and were receiving treatment. Another 4 were admitted to a private hospital in Khayega and 15 were rushed to the St Elizabeth hospital after complaining of similar symptoms.

Dr Olaka said samples had been obtained for testing to establish whether there was an outbreak of the disease at the school, located near the Khayega market. "Our preliminary investigations point to a malaria outbreak. We are still carrying out further investigations to establish what the other students could be suffering from," Dr Olaka said.

The authorities are also investigating the possibility that the students were sickened by food poisoning or contaminated water. He said there was no cause for alarm as the students were receiving treatment and were in a stable condition.

The students were reported to be sleeping without using mosquito nets in their dormitories. A parent told Nation.Africa he had learned about the outbreak when he went to visit his daughter last Saturday [21 May 2022]. "I was informed that several students had been admitted to the nearby hospital.

Health executive Dr Collins Matemba said a full report on the outbreak of the disease would be released after the public health team finalises investigations.

A teacher at the school said an outbreak of a waterborne disease was suspected. The school's water supply could have been contaminated, he said.

[It seems that malaria has not been entirely confirmed with only 9 out of 28 testing positive. Other causes of the outbreak are still being investigated.

The average elevation of Kakamega is 1535 metres (about 5000 ft) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakamega). The average night temperature at this time of the year is around 15C to 16C [59F-61F] (https://en.climate-data.org/africa/kenya/kakamega/kakamega-922/).

Falciparum can not develop in the mosquito when the temperature drops below 20C. If the data on the night temperature I cited is correct there is no transmission of _P. falciparum_ in that area. The data may be wrong and the temperature is over 20C throughout a 24-hour period and transmission is possible. Note that the school did not rule out other courses and highlighted that diarrhoea was also seen. Diarrhoea is not usually associated with malaria. - Mod.EP
