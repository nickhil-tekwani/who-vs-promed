I want to second R. Michael Hendry's complaint about the appearance of W.
John Martin's "stealth virus" post on ProMED-mail. About a year ago I
posted a critique of Martin's paper, "Stealth Virus Epidemic in the Mojave
Valley: Initial Report of Virus Isolation", to the health fraud e-mail
list as an example of a shoddy publication whose content lent no support to
its conclusions, and whose authors disregarded basic principles of
epidemiology and logic.
ProMED-mail readers interested in the question of integrity in science
should take a look at Martin's website [URL deleted - Mod.JW, particularly
the appeal for donations to combat the "health emergency" posed by
stealth-virus-caused chronic fatigue syndrome, attention deficit disorder,
bipolar disorder, and autism.
