A 10-year-old boy has died of rabies after being bitten by a dog in his head, face, and mouth 20 days ago in the Dayikend village of Azerbaijan's Salyan. Rita Ismayilova, head of the department of epidemiology of especially dangerous infectious diseases of the Republican Anti Plague Station under the Health Ministry, told APA that the boy was admitted to the Salyan district central hospital the same day he was attacked by the dog. However, the child's body failed to create immunity as the incubation period of the disease was short, so it developed into rabies. The child was transferred to Baku and received symptomatic treatment in the children infectious diseases hospital No.1.

Nevertheless, the child could not be saved and he died on 7 Jul 2016. It's well known that there's no treatment for a person who is infected with rabies; it results in death", she said. She added that about 17 000 people bitten by animals every year are healed [see comment]. On rare occasions, the incubation period is very short. "This child's incubation period was 14 days and symptoms had already manifested. The treatment didn't help because the child's body failed to create immunity. Moreover, he had been bitten in dangerous parts -- his face, head, fingers, upper body. These areas are close to the brain and therefore death occurs earlier", she said. Note that this is the 2nd such [event] recorded in 2016. The 1st incident took place in Zagatala in May; P.T. (b. 1969) did not go to hospital after being bitten and died of rabies in Zagatala [See item 2].

[The term "healed" may mislead, suggestive of remedying established rabies disease. The 17 000 people bitten by animals in Azerbaijan have, rather likely, undergone a "post exposure prophylaxis" treatment, preventing the development of disease (which, unfortunately, cannot be healed...). - Mod.AS]

Azerbaijan's Health Ministry on Tue [24 May 2016] confirmed its 1st recorded human rabies case in the country in 2016. Liya Bayramova, spokesperson for the Health Ministry, told APA that P.T., 47, a resident of the Faldar village of the country's Zagatala district, was hospitalized with symptoms of rabies on 22 May 2016. "The woman was bitten by a dog on 1 Apr 2016, but she didn't admit to hospital immediately," Bayramova said.

She noted that in fact, in animal bite cases, people must be vaccinated against rabies within 14 days. "Turajova went to the hospital after 52 days when signs of rabies appeared. Her treatment continued in a hospital in Zagatala, and doctors from Minghachevir and Baku were sent for consultation," she added.

Rita Ismayilova, head of the department of epidemiology of especially dangerous infectious diseases of the Republican Anti Plague Station under the Health Ministry, told APA that a dog bit the index finger of that woman's right hand 2 months ago. "As she was slightly injured, she didn't seek medical aid. The wound healed, but 2 months later she began to exhibit signs of rabies. Symptoms begin with fear of light, water and air. Though the woman was hospitalized, human rabies case often results in death," Ismayilova noted.

She added that it is the 1st case of human rabies recorded in Azerbaijan in 2016. The last case of human rabies was recorded 3-4 years ago.

[The statement of the spokesperson that "in fact, in animal bite cases, people must be vaccinated against rabies within 14 days" does not comply with WHO guidelines for the "post exposure prophylaxis (PEP)" procedures. Such cases require "immediate" post-exposure-prophylaxis treatment. Subscribers are referred to the following WHO's "Top 10 General Considerations in Rabies PEP", updated 2014:

1. Wounds must be immediately washed/flushed for 15 minutes and disinfected.
2. Rabies PEP should be instituted immediately. PEP consists of a course of potent, effective rabies vaccine that meets WHO recommendations and administration of rabies immunoglobulin.
3. PEP must be applied using vaccine regimens and administration routes that have been proven to be safe and effective.
4. PEP does not have contraindications if purified rabies immunoglobulin and vaccine are used. Pregnancy and infancy are not contraindications to PEP.
5. If rabies immunoglobulin is not available on 1st visit, use can be delayed by up to 7 days from the date of the 1st vaccine dose.
6. Initiation of PEP should not await the results of laboratory diagnosis or be delayed by dog observation when rabies is suspected.
7. When suspect rabid animal contacts (excluding bats) occur in areas free of carnivore-mediated rabies and where there is adequate surveillance in place, PEP may not be required. The decision must be based on expert risk assessment.
8. Patients presenting for rabies PEP even months after having been bitten should be treated as if the contact had recently occurred.
9. PEP should be administered even if the suspect animal is not available for testing or observation. However, vaccine and immunoglobulin administration may be discontinued if the animal involved: is a vaccinated dog (cat or ferret) that following observation for 10 days, remains healthy or is humanely killed and declared negative for rabies by a WHO prescribed laboratory test.
10. In areas enzootic for (canine and wildlife) rabies, PEP should be instituted immediately unless adequate laboratory surveillance and data indicates that the species involved is not a vector of rabies.

For the above and further information, see WHO "Guide for Rabies Pre and Post Exposure Prophylaxis in Humans at http://www.who.int/rabies/PEP_Prophylaxis_guideline_15_12_2014.pdf?ua=1.

The recent case, in a child (item 1), was a "Category III" case ("Bites to the head, neck, face hand and genitals") requiring special treatment.

A case of rabies has been detected in a bat at Fontenay-le-Comte (Vendee France). The infected bat was discovered in a weakened condition on 26 Jun 2016 in the gardens of the Post, by a passer-by who took it to a veterinarian.

Bat is the common name given to the flying mammals that constitute the order of bats or Cheiroptera.

[4] Rapid rabies diagnosis in brain tissue - assessment

Rabies kills about 60 000 people a year, many of them children in Africa and Asia. Rapid tests for the infection are badly needed in poor countries.

But diagnostic test strips made by 6 companies for this purpose are "unsatisfactory" and "cannot be recommended," according to recent evaluations by scientists at the Friedrich-Loeffler Institute in Germany.

None of the 6 testing kits, made in response to an appeal from the World Health Organization, had high false-positive rates. But they all had unacceptably high false-negative rates, meaning that someone bitten by a rabid animal might not be found to need treatment. The evaluations were detailed last month in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases. Test results varied by batches, the evaluators found, suggesting that some manufacturers had poor quality control. The kits were made by companies in China, Germany, India, South Korea and the United States, and cost 3 to 11 USD.

Most victims of rabies are bitten by dogs, although bats, foxes, raccoons and many other animals can also carry the virus. Untreated rabies is usually fatal. Treatment often involves five doses of vaccine into the arm over several weeks, and sometimes several shots of immunoglobulin directly into the wound. In the United States, that can easily cost 3000USD. In poor countries, the cost of treatment varies enormously, but it is sometimes more than a family earns in months.

The kits are used to test the animal, not the bite victim. It must be found and killed so a dilution of its brain can be dripped into the well of the kit. The study, the authors wrote, was not done to discredit rapid tests "but rather to encourage producers to substantially improve and assure the quality of their products".

Abstract:
Rabies is a neglected zoonotic disease that causes an estimated 60 000 human deaths annually. The main burden lies on developing countries in Asia and Africa, where surveillance and disease detection is hampered by absence of adequate laboratory facilities and/or the difficulties of submitting samples from remote areas to laboratories. Under these conditions, easy-to-use tests such as immunochromatographic assays, i.e. lateral flow devices (LFD), may increase surveillance and improve control efforts. Several LFDs for rabies diagnosis are available but, except for 1, there are no data regarding their performance. Therefore, we compared 6 commercially available LFDs for diagnostic and analytical sensitivity, as well as their specificity and their diagnostic agreement with standard rabies diagnostic techniques using different sample sets, including experimentally infected animals and several sets of field samples. Using field samples the sensitivities ranged between 0 up to 100 percent depending on the LFD and the samples, while for experimentally infected animals the maximum sensitivity was 32 percent. Positive results in LFD could be further validated using RT-qPCR and sequencing. In summary, in our study none of the tests investigated proved to be satisfactory, although the results somewhat contradict previous studies, indicating batch to batch variation. The high number of false negative results reiterates the necessity to perform a proper test validation before being marketed and used in the field. In this respect, marketing authorization and batch release control could secure a sufficient quality for these alternative tests, which could then fulfill their potential. - Mod.AS]

Residents of Panchlai village in Valsad's Pardi taluka woke up to a fierce attack by a rabid dog on Thu [30 Jun 2016] night. The dog attacked 6 people, including 2 women, and over a dozen cattle.

Stray dog menace in the village of Valsad and nearby areas is assuming serious proportions. The incident occurred at Dipli Falia in Panchlai village at midnight. The victims were sleeping outside their houses when the dog attacked them. Before attacking the villagers, the dog had bitten the cattle heads that were tied. Locals said the canine had come into the area only a few days ago and had been attacking other dogs too. "The dog started biting people around 11pm in Dipli Faliya. People tried to stone the dog which only made it more aggressive," said Harshad Patel, an eyewitness and relative of a victim.

The victims were immediately rushed to a private hospital at Dharampur, some 15 km [approx. 9 mi]from the village. The victims were administered anti-rabies vaccination and allowed to go home.

A victim, K.P., 60, said, "I was sleeping outside the house at night when the dog came near me. I woke up and the dog bit on my hand. When I screamed, it left the spot and attacked another woman sleeping next to my house."

Village elder Bacchubhai Patel said, "We tried to locate the dog at night, but could not find it in the dark. So, we started the hunt in the morning and found the dog on the outskirts of the village. We ghearoed the dog and killed it. Patel added, "The rabid dog has bitten other dogs in the village. We fear that the victim dogs may also contract rabies. Thus, we have asked the village panchayat to catch the dogs and release them in the jungle."

A 40-year-old woman died of rabies at the municipal corporation run Naidu Infectious Diseases Hospital on 1 Jul 2016. The deceased, identified as K.K., was a resident of Vidyanagar on Katraj-Kondhwa Road. She was brought to the hospital on 30 Jun 2016, doctors said, adding that she was already in a critical condition by then.

With this, the number of deaths due to the fatal infection has risen to 14 this year. This is, however, the 1st rabies casualty reported among city residents, as the rest were referred to Pune hospitals from nearby areas.

K.K. developed symptoms like fever, pain in abdomen, sweating and breathlessness a few days ago and was admitted to a private hospital. After her condition worsened, she was shifted to Naidu Hospital around 8.20pm on 30 June. "She had full-blown rabies symptoms at the time of admission; she had already developed a fear of water and air. Her condition was critical," the doctor said.

A civic health official said, "It was a category-III dog bite wound. As per her medical history, she did not take any anti-rabies vaccination or fast-acting antibodies on the scheduled days. She was also not given rabies immunoglobulin, a ready-made antibody which is extremely effective in deactivating the virus in a category-III dog-bite injury."

The victims are usually injected with a fast-acting ready-made antibody and rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) near the wound to deactivate the rabies virus. The antibodies are given to the patient for immediate protection because the vaccine generally takes 14 days to produce antibodies.

As per World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines, RIG should be given for all category-III exposed patients, irrespective of the interval between the exposure and the beginning of the treatment.

A pregnant woman died of rabies in Badhu VDC of Bajura district. According to Dr Bikal Lamichhane of the Kolti Primary Health Centre, the deceased has been identified as M.A. (23) of Badhu-7. M.A., who was 5 months pregnant, was bitten by a stray dog on 29 Jun 2016. She was taken to the Kolti Primary Health Centre on 1 Jul 2016, 2 days after the incident.

Dr Lamichhane said that she was referred to the District Hospital in Bajura after the treatment was not possible in the Kolti Primary Health Centre due to lack of anti-rabies vaccine. After the treatment was not possible in the District Hospital as well, she was referred to another hospital. 'She could have been saved, had she received treatment on time," a family member said.
