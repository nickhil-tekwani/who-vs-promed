Eight farmers have been diagnosed with arsenic poisoning and 68 others showed symptoms in southwest China's Guizhou Province after drinking water from an abandoned mine during a summer drought.

None of the sickened people are in critical condition, doctors said.

Local officials said they noticed late last week [week of 16 Sep 2013] that many farmers in the Wangjiazhai village showed signs of swollen eyelids, headache, and weakness and suspected that their drinking water might have been polluted.

The Sandu county sent health, disease control, and environmental experts to the village to investigate. Water and urine samples were also sent to the provincial disease control center in Guiyang for examination.

Arsenic poisoning was confirmed on Tuesday [24 Sep 2013].

It was found out that during the summer drought, the village pumped water from an abandoned mine to its water tower twice to ease water shortage.

The provincial government has set up an emergency center to deal with the matter. Doctors are going door to door to conduct health examination for farmers who had drunk the water. Free treatment is offered to all patients.

A fire engine is now supplying drinking water to the farmers. Pipes are being laid to supply water to the village from a nearby water plant, the work is to be done Friday night [27 Sep 2013].

Arsenic is a semi-metal element in the periodic table. It is odorless and tasteless. It enters drinking water supplies from natural deposits in the earth or from agricultural and industrial practices. Arsenic is a naturally occurring element widely distributed in the earth's crust. In the environment, arsenic is combined with oxygen, chlorine, and sulfur to form inorganic arsenic compounds. Arsenic in animals and plants combines with carbon and hydrogen to form organic arsenic compounds.

There are different forms of arsenic. There are 2 forms of inorganic arsenic: the reduced or trivalent arsenic(+3) or arsenite, and the oxidized or pentavalent (+5) form known as arsenate. Both of these forms can be absorbed and accumulated in tissues and body fluids.

There are also organic arsenics, but these are generally regarded as less harmful, by orders of magnitude.

Inorganic arsenic compounds are mainly used to preserve wood. Copper chromated arsenate (CCA) is used to make "pressure-treated" lumber. CCA is no longer used in the US for residential uses; it is still used in industrial applications. Organic arsenic compounds are used as pesticides, primarily on cotton fields and orchards.

Non-cancer effects can include thickening and discoloration of the skin, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting; diarrhea; numbness in hands and feet; partial paralysis; and blindness. Arsenic has been linked to cancer of the bladder, lungs, skin, kidney, nasal passages, liver, and prostate.

The arsenic standard for drinking water is set at .010 parts per million (10 parts per billion) to protect consumers served by public water systems from the effects of long-term, chronic exposure to arsenic.

Almost nothing is known regarding health effects of organic arsenic compounds in humans. Studies in animals show that some simple organic arsenic compounds are less toxic than inorganic forms. Ingestion of methyl and dimethyl compounds can cause diarrhea and damage to the kidneys.

Inorganic arsenic is found throughout the environment; it is released into the air by volcanoes, the weathering of arsenic-containing minerals and ores, and by commercial or industrial processes (1,2). Given this, it is likely the mine did contain arsenic.

For most people, food is the largest source of arsenic exposure (about 25 to 50 micrograms per day [microg/d]), with lower amounts coming from drinking water and air. Among foods, some of the highest levels are found in fish and shellfish; however, this arsenic exists primarily as organic compounds, which are less toxic (1). Elevated levels of inorganic arsenic may be present in soil, either from natural mineral deposits or contamination from human activities, which may lead to dermal or ingestion exposure (1).

In the case of this village, it is clearly the water that has been identified as being problematic. However, if they watered gardens with this water, then plant uptake and continued exposure may be a problem.

This article indicates that water is being provided, and treatment is offered free of charge but it does not tell us what kind of treatment they are using. There are a number of chelation agents that are effective, but availability of specific chelators often depends upon the country.
