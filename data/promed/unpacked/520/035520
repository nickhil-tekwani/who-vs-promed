Malagasy officials have raised the death toll from a recent plague outbreak to 47 as the bacterial disease spreads through the country. Madagascar's Health Ministry made the announcement on Mon 24 Nov 2014, and warned that the toll would probably rise over the coming months as it spreads towards the capital Antananarivo. They added that 138 suspect cases have been recorded since the beginning of 2014. The ministry went on to say that it is attempting to contain the outbreak by disinfection of residents' homes. The WHO has confirmed the dispatch of health workers to sanitize slums in the capital.

According to Philemon Tafangy, the health ministry's secretary general, "200 households have been disinfected" this month [November 2014]. He added that in an attempt to arrest the spread of the disease, antimicrobials have been given to all those who had come in contact with the infected.

[This report increases the total number of cases by 19 and the death toll by 7 since the ProMED posting on 22 Nov 2014. It is not entirely clear what the epidemic curve for _Yersinia pestis_ infection in Madagascar looks like but it is likely that the majority of cases are from the rainy season, beginning in August 2014. Additionally, there is no breakdown of cases into the manifestations of plague infection especially how many cases of pneumonic plague have occurred. - Mod.LL
