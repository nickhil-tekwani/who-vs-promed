Alberta officials are investigating an outbreak of _E. coli_ that has sickened 34 people, including 11 who were hospitalized and one person who likely died from the bacterium. Alberta Health Services says 21 of the lab-confirmed cases are linked to Mama Nita's Binalot restaurant in Edmonton late in March 2018. Officials say they aren't sure of the source of the 13 other cases.

Dr. Chris Sikora, medical officer of health, says the outbreak is extremely complex, and Alberta is working with federal agencies on the investigation.

Officials say _E. coli_ O157:H7 infections are generally caused when a person eats food or drinks water that is contaminated with human or animal feces, or through direct contact with a person who is sick or with animals that carry the bacteria. Symptoms can include bloody diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps and kidney failure.

[It is not clear at this point how many of the newer reported cases are related to the restaurant. Additionally, it is not directly stated whether all the cases are related based on analysis. Mortality from EHEC tends to be related more to central nervous system complications rather than the effect of Shiga toxin on the kidney. - Mod.LL
