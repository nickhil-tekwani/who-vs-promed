Second case of bluetongue found
--------------------------------
Government veterinarians have found bluetongue disease in a 2nd cow
on a Suffolk farm, Defra has said. The midge-borne bluetongue virus
was found in a Highland cow at the Baylham House Rare Breeds Farm,
near Ipswich. The strain of the disease is the same as one that has
devastated cattle and sheep herds across northern Europe.
The infected cow's carcass has been removed and further tests are
being carried out to see if it has spread to other livestock on the
farm. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
said it would not be classed as an outbreak unless other cases were confirmed.
A 20km (12 mile) control zone will be placed around the farm if
bluetongue appears to have infected other animals and insects.
Defra said tests were ongoing and it was unlikely any results would
be announced in the next few hours. Chief Vet Debby Reynolds said
the discovery of bluetongue was an "unwelcome but not unforeseen"
development. "The aim is to get farming back to normal when the risk
is acceptable to do so," she said.
Ben Woolf, a neighbouring farmer, said the discovery of bluetongue
disease was worrying. "In the short term, foot-and-mouth is clearly
a more devastating disease because it wipes out whole herds," he
said. [FMD does not "wipe out whole herds"; only if/when stamping-out
policy is applied, would whole herds indeed be wiped out. The direct
severe economical losses known to be caused by FMD, are the results
of the virus' extreme infectivity and rapid spread (invasiveness) in
susceptible, unvaccinated populations. It may, though, cause high
mortality in young animals. - Mod. AS].
"It's the unknown with bluetongue. How long is it going to last?
What's the long-term economic impact going to be - that's the real
concern." Environment Secretary Hilary Benn said he understood the
arrival of bluetongue was "unwelcome news" for farmers at a difficult time.
Bluetongue disease is transmitted by [certain] _Culicoides_ [midges].
It is passed from animal to midge, and from midge to animal, but is
not transmitted from animal to animal.
Deputy chief veterinary officer Fred Landeg said that a frosty winter
could help wipe out Britain's midge population. But the president of
the British Veterinary Association, David Catlow, said Britain may
have to "learn to live" with bluetongue by restricting movements of
infected animals until a vaccine is made available.
Animals with the disease experience discomfort, with flu-like
symptoms, and swelling and haemorrhaging in and around the mouth and
nose. They can also go lame and have difficulty eating. [The above
description may be applicable to cattle infected with the BTV-8
serotype. Other serotypes -- there are 23 of them -- are known to be
rather subclinical in cattle, in spite the fact that cattle are more
readily bitten, and infected, by the vector. However, most BTV
serotypes, including BTV-8, will cause serious to very serious
disease in sheep, particularly in susceptible breeds where very high
mortality rates have been recorded, which in extreme cases -- and
when highly pathogenic BTV strains are involved -- may be as high as
70 percent of the infected animals. - Mod. AS].

Bluetongue update: 2nd cow positive for bluetongue in Suffolk
----------------------------------------------------------------
A 2nd cow has tested positive for bluetongue on the same farm in
Baylham, Suffolk, where the disease was 1st discovered on 22 Sep
2007. This is not sufficient evidence to confirm an outbreak of
bluetongue as it cannot yet be demonstrated that the disease is
circulating between the local animal and midge populations [See commentary].
The cow was culled today as it may have posed a threat to the other
animals on the premises. This is because it could have potentially
provided a source of infection for the local midge population. We
continue to test the remaining animals on the premises and surrounding area.
It remains essential for animal keepers to practice the highest
standards of biosecurity, remain vigilant for disease and report any
suspicions immediately. Livestock owners should examine their
livestock twice a day.

[Clinical symptoms of bluetongue will appear after the peak of
viraemia; even if the animal discovered to be infected is the index
case (which is most unlikely), the culicoides vectors had already had
their chance for meals of infected blood. Wide-scale serological
surveillance is required to exclude the more likely scenario, namely
that there are other, subclinically infected bovines in the area or,
in other words, that the virus is already circulating.
The current UK policy, including refraining from calling the outbreak
an outbreak, are based upon EC legislation (which is not similar to
OIE's code). Council Directive 2000/75/EC of 20 Nov 2000, laying down
specific provisions for the control and eradication of bluetongue,
says (in article 3): "Member States shall ensure the immediate,
compulsory notification to the competent authority if circulation of
the bluetongue virus is suspected or confirmed". This legislation
dates back to the days when Europe, particularly northern Europe,
viewed bluetongue as an exotic disease which was not likely to spread
even if infected animals be introduced, since there was not an
efficient local vector. all this has drastically changed, while the
legislation is lagging behind.
In this context, it is worthwhile to cite from OIE's Terrestrial
Animal Health Code, APPENDIX 3.8.10. "GUIDELINES FOR THE SURVEILLANCE
OF BLUETONGUE", article 3.8.10.4., "Surveillance strategies":
"The use of a vector surveillance system to detect the presence of
circulating virus is not recommended as a routine procedure as the
typically low vector infection rates mean that such detections can be
rare. Other surveillance strategies (e.g. the use of sentinel animals
of domestic ruminants) are preferred to detect virus circulation". - Mod. AS].

Bluetongue and Foot and Mouth Disease: an integrated strategy
-------------------------------------------------------------
Chief Veterinary Officer, Debby Reynolds, today outlined the
integrated, risk based approach to deal with the current disease
situation with both Bluetongue and Foot and Mouth Disease, based on
the contingency plan and continued work with industry.
Defra has identified, from 3.30pm Tue 25 Sep 2007, a Bluetongue
Temporary Area while surveillance is carried out to determine whether
the virus is circulating. This area encompasses Lincolnshire,
Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire, Cambridgeshire, Norfolk, Suffolk,
Northamptonshire and Bedfordshire, and covers those additional areas
which could be included in any further movement controls should an
outbreak of Bluetongue be confirmed. "In the next 24 hours everyone
needs to prepare for their own role in ensuring this important next
step is successful. We recognise the real economic and welfare
pressures being experienced by farmers. The risk of animal movements
is evaluated on a daily basis and we have a clear commitment to allow
movements, including to livestock markets, as soon as the situation allows."
Notes to editors
------------------
Bluetongue Temporary Area [8 counties; see map indicated in
commentary]: The same movements as in the FMD Risk Zone will apply,
but in addition, farm to farm movements will be permitted under
strict conditions and subject to high levels of biosecurity. Cattle
and sheep will not be permitted to move out of the Bluetongue
Temporary Area, but pig movements within established pyramids will be
permitted to move, subject to licence conditions.

[The above animal movement restrictions are reflected in Defra's map
of "Great Britain with FMD Protection and Surveillance Zones and
Bluetongue Affected Counties Day 52, 24 Sep 2007", available at
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/fmd/pdf/map-zones240907.pdf>.
According to the map's legend, it includes the following distinct zones:
- FMD Protection Zone,
- FMD Surveillance Zone,
- FMD Risk Area (11 counties),
- FMD Low Risk Area,
- Bluetongue Temporary Area.
The latter includes 8 counties: Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire,
Leicestershire, Cambridgeshire, Norfolk, Suffolk, Northamptonshire
and Bedfordshire.- Mod. AS].

EU says vaccination is best cure against bluetongue
-----------------------------------------------------
Vaccination is the best way to fight the specific strain of
bluetongue virus rampaging through cattle and sheep in northern EU
countries and vast amounts of vaccine may well be needed, the EU
executive said on Monday [24 Sep 2007]. But the problem for farmers
is that the particular strain of the virus that has occurred in the
northern EU -- serotype 8, one of 24 recognised -- is one for which
no vaccine is yet available.
Britain, whose farmers are also struggling with outbreaks of FMD, was
the latest European Union country to be hit with the viral sickness
when laboratory tests detected bluetongue in a cow in eastern England
last weekend. [And, as reported above, a 2nd cow as well. - Mod. AS].
Spread by midges, bluetongue has moved with alarming speed this year
across Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and now
Britain. In the past, it tended to occur only in warmer, more
southerly countries like Spain and Italy. In 2007, more than 12 000
cases of bluetongue have been reported in central-northern countries
of the European Union.
Two companies are now developing a vaccine for serotype 8, likely to
be available in early 2008. Officials at the European Commission, the
EU's executive arm, say considerable amounts may be needed to meet
demand from farmers in several EU countries. "There is, or will be,
considerable demand for this vaccine," one official said. "We will do
all we can to speed up its approval ... it's preventive vaccination
so you'd have to do it on quite a wide scale to be effective."
Bluetongue does not affect humans and there is no risk of contracting
the disease by consuming milk or meat from infected animals. It can
spread extremely rapidly since the midges can be easily propelled
through the air by strong winds. The virus is characterised by
inflammation of the mucous membranes, congestion, swelling and
haemorrhages. Sheep are often the worst affected animals, suffering
from breathing problems, lameness, drooling and high body
temperatures. In some cases, the animal's tongue turns blue.
The best way to fight the virus, farming experts say, is by
vaccination, since slaughtering infected animals does not make sense
as long as [only] midges are responsible for transmitting
bluetongue. Cattle can carry the disease but often do not show
symptoms for months afterwards: a "silent source" of infection.
"We consider that vaccination is an important instrument to fight
this disease. It isn't mandatory but we would look favourably on any
(EU-27) member state request to apply vaccination," the Commission
official said. Costs of the vaccine itself would be met by EU funding
while the Commission would pay half the expenses incurred by farmers
who chose to vaccinate their herds or flocks, he said. "It
(vaccination) is the only effective instrument we have to tackle the
disease...and it's already used in Portugal, Spain and Italy where
they've had bluetongue, albeit a different strain, for some years," he said.
If an outbreak is confirmed, a 150 km restriction zone is imposed on
livestock within the affected area subject to further testing.

[Hear, hear! It is encouraging to note these timely, realistic,
science-based and refreshing observations of the "Commission
officials". The specific BTV-8 vaccine is urgently needed;
unfortunately, too late for the current disease season but hopefully
ready for wide-scale field application at the beginning of 2008, and
in any case before the renewed activity of the
vectors, particularly, in view of the spread of the BTV-8 into the
UK with its multi-million sheep population. - Mod. AS].
