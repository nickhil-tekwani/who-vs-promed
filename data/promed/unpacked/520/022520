I would like to add some precision to the posting "BSE - France: National
Testing Program" message from 20 Mar 2000. It is correct the plan is to
test 40 000 cows, but it is not right to say that these will be 40 000
animals that had died or are killed after they showed signs of the disease.
The idea is to look with the test for BSE on fallen stock, emergency
slaughtered animals, or any animal found dead on the farm without sign of
BSE. These animals represent a higher risk sub-population where the test
could be usefully "tested". The clinical surveillance (passive surveillance
as it is called) of BSE, starting with the recognition of suspect clinical
signs on live animals will continue, as started in February 1991 in this
country.
