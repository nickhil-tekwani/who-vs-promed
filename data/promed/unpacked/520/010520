[This is now the 4th death reported associated with infection with the 2019-nCoV. High risk factors for a severe disease presentation included his age and history of pre-existing chronic comorbidities. It would be of interest to learn if those individuals described as in serious condition and those in critical condition have significant high risk factors such as increased age, and pre-existing co-morbidities that might pre-dispose to impaired immunity. - Mod.MPP]

[4] Cases in healthcare workers, person-to-person transmission

A Chinese expert investigating pneumonia that is thought to be caused by a new type of coronavirus that spreads in China says that "human-to-human transmission was confirmed'', revealing 14 cases of transmission to healthcare professionals.

In response to an interview with China Central Television, Zhong Nanshan, head of a team of experts from the Chinese health authorities, said that 95% of the patients were linked to Wuhan in Hubei Province and Guangdong Province have already confirmed human-to-human transmission."

He also clarified that there were 14 cases of transmission to healthcare professionals, and from this point that human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.

As for the case in Guangdong Province, Zhong said, "2 patients have never been to Wuhan, and their families have been infected."

To date, health authorities in Wuhan have only stated that "the possibility of human-to-human transmission cannot be ruled out," and the Chinese government has not yet officially announced the route.

Regarding the source of the virus, Zhong said that Wuhan has a large seafood market in the area where patients are concentrated, and that there are shops that feed wild animals in the market. He said that it was highly probable.

[The occurrence of 14 cases in healthcare workers is most likely due to person-to-person transmission of the 2019-nCov and is not surprising. The rapid increase in cases both in Wuhan City and elsewhere in China has been highly suggestive of person-to-person transmission as well. Prior experience with the SARS-CoV in 2002-2003 including initial "species jump" from intermediary animal hosts to humans working in close contact with this animals (civet cats/palm civets) followed by person-to-person transmission and nosocomial transmission with healthcare workers disproportionately represented among the cases. Similarly, the MERS-CoV has a background endemic rate with sporadic "species jump" from camels to humans, and periodic outbreaks when infection control procedures are compromised. With both the SARS-CoV and the MERS-CoV, superspreaders (individuals shedding high virus loads) were also significant sources of transmission of the coronaviruses in outbreaks.

Right now there is a heightened awareness focusing on individuals travelling from Wuhan City. One can't help but wonder if the net should be cast wider and case definitions should focus on the clinical presentation of cases, not just limiting suspicion to those individuals with a history of being in Wuhan City. - Mod.MPP]

[5] WHO to convene IHR emergency committee meeting

The World Health Organization (WHO) called for an emergency meeting on [Mon 20 Jan 2020] as a mysterious virus spreads across China.

The meeting on [Wed 22 Jan 2020] will assess whether the outbreak of the new coronavirus constitutes an international health emergency and what measures should be taken, Reuters reports.

The health organization said "an animal source" appeared to likely be the primary source of the outbreak, adding that some "limited human-to-human transmission" occurred between close contacts, according to Reuters.

WHO has not yet recommended trade or travel restrictions.

On [Mon 20 Jan 2020], Chinese officials also confirmed the 1st case of human-to-human transmission of the deadly virus. The virus, which was first discovered in China's Wuhan province, has spread to more Chinese cities including in Beijing and Shanghai, authorities reportedly said [Mon 20 Jan 2020].

South Korea confirmed its 1st case of the virus [Mon 20 Jan 2020], marking the 4th case reported outside of China's borders, according to Reuters. The new cases bring the total known worldwide to 222, according to the newswire.
