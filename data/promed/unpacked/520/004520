Mumps outbreak
-----------------
We currently have an outbreak of mumps in London, which is due to a strain
previously found in an outbreak where the index case had acquired the
disease abroad. We are investigating the possibility that the current
outbreak may also be associated with travel abroad. We are particularly
interested in hearing about recent or ongoing outbreaks of mumps in Eastern
Europe, Indian subcontinent, Israel or Belgium and would like to hear about
mumps activity anywhere, but particularly in the above-mentioned countries.
All information gratefully received!
