Japan's hopes of repeating its Melbourne Cup triumph of last year
[2006] have been hit hard, with the country reeling from an outbreak
of equine influenza.
Only 2 weeks before last year's [2006] cup winner Delta Blues and
runner-up Pop Rock are due to enter quarantine, there are grave
doubts over whether they will be allowed into Australia.
Last Friday [17 Aug 2007], Japan Racing Association (JRA) officials
made the extraordinary decision to cancel all race meetings
throughout the country after equine influenza was detected in more
than 20 horses.
One of the country's most accomplished gallopers, Meisho Samson, has
been diagnosed with the virus, and his planned trip to France for
next week's Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe has been called off.
It is understood the JRA contacted Racing Victoria Ltd (RVL)
officials last week to alert them of the rising number of cases
detected. RVL chief executive Stephen Allanson said yesterday [19 Aug
2007] that his office was monitoring the situation.
"We have been speaking to Japan, and it seems Pop Rock and Delta
Blues have not been exposed to the virus at this stage," he said.
"From what we have been told, the outbreak has been discovered in 2
major training centres.
"They have 2 weeks before going into quarantine, but we will have to
wait and see. The final decision will be made by the Australian
Quarantine Inspection Services."
News of the virus has seen Pop Rock and Delta Blues drift out in the betting.
Early last week, the Japanese authorities had 200 veterinary surgeons
examine 5000 animals and banned horse movement around the country to
contain any spread.
As of late last week, further tests on 163 racehorses showed that 29
had contracted the virus, prompting the JRA to cancel racing for the
1st time in 36 years.

[According to OIE's data on equine influenza (EI) in Japan, derived
from the Handistatus database (last updated at the end of 2004) and
the WAHID database (updated December 2006), the last year of this
disease's occurrence was 1972; vaccination is routinely applied.
Equine influenza is an acute, contagious respiratory disease caused
by 2 distinct subtypes (H7N7, formerly equi-1, and H3N8, formerly
equi-2) of influenza A viruses within the genus _Influenzavirus A_ of
the family _Orthomyxoviridae_.
Information on the virus strain involved in the current cases and on
the vaccination status the affected horses is requested.
