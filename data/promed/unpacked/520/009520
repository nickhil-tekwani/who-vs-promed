Russia dealing with Legionnaires' outbreak
--------------------------------------------
A total of 3 people have died and more than 100 others ranging in age
from 18 to 81 have been hospitalized in Russia with Legionnaires'
disease. The outbreak is confined to an area some 6 miles from
Yekaterinburg in the middle Urals region, the Russian news agency
Itar-Tass reported Monday [30 Jul 2007]. An official of the regional
health ministry says all of the victims are local residents and most
are showing improvement with antibiotic therapy.
Several medical centers in the area have sent specialists and
equipment to the town of Verkhnyaya Pyshma where the outbreak
occurred. Authorities say the infection likely was spread through the
water supply system.
Legionnaire's disease is a type of pneumonia caused by breathing in
mist from water that contains the bacteria Legionella. It was first
identified some 30 years ago when an outbreak of pneumonia occurred
at an American Legion convention in Philadelphia.

Yekaterinburg is the 5th largest city in Russia with a population of
about 1.3 million people. It is located about 1000 miles east of
Moscow on the eastern slopes of the Ural mountains
(<http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/yekaterinburg#history>).
Yekaterinburg (then Sverdlovsk) was the site of an anthrax outbreak
in April and May 1979, which was attributed by Soviet officials to
the locals eating contaminated meat. However, American agencies
believe that the locals inhaled spores accidentally released from an
aerosol of pathogen at a military microbiology facility. Summers are
short and relatively cool; temperatures reach 70 degrees F
(<http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/yekaterinburg#history>).
Legionnaires' disease is the acute pneumonic form of disease caused
by _Legionella_, usually _Legionella pneumophila_. About 80-90
percent of cases are caused by _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1.
Pontiac fever is a non-pneumonic illness also caused by _Legionella_.
Legionnaires' disease was first recognized when an outbreak of
pneumonia occurred among participants at an American Legion
convention during the summer of 1976 in Philadelphia and was focused
mainly at one convention hotel (Fraser DW, et al. Legionnaires'
disease: Description of an epidemic of pneumonia. N Engl J Med 1977;
297:1189-97), _L. pneumophila_ grows best in warm water and are
intracellular parasites of amebas that are found in biofilms that
line piping in warm water plumbing systems. Disruption of the biofilm
can release the organisms into the flowing water. Infection follows
inhalation by susceptible people of aerosols of the contaminated
water. Aerosols can be generated by a building's faulty air
conditioning systems, shower heads, misters, whirlpool spas, and
other such devices.
A clinical description of cases in Yekaterinburg and possible sources
for this outbreak are not as yet given in the news releases. A
discussion of Legionnaires' disease and investigation of an outbreak
can be found in
