Friday, Associated Press reported the first case of BSE in the Netherlands.
An affected cow, which originated from a farm in the central Dutch town of
Wilp, was identified at a slaughterhouse. According to the Dutch Agriculture
Ministry, none of its meat reached the food chain there. All cattle on the
farm will be slaughtered and their brains investigated for the disease.

The Washington Post published this morning a Reuters wire service report
saying the Netherlands has confirmed its first case of Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy (BSE). The disease was suspected in a 5-year-old pregnant
cow last week and was confirmed by subsequent laboratory testing. Dutch
Farm Minister Jozias van Aartsen, speaking on television, said "The
Netherlands was until now an island free of this disease ... With great regret
I have to announce that this is no longer the case."

[Until further details are available, one might assume at this time that
this an autochthenous case of BSE and that the animal was not of British or
Swiss origin/birth. Further speculation would be gratuitous. MHJ]
