Two dogs died after eating parts of a deadly plant having flown into their yard during a monsoon storm last week. [JA], a dog owner who also runs Pibbles and FamBam Rescue, wants to use this painful lesson to warn others about the Red Giant Castor.

"We had no idea the tree was there, and we could see it. Once we knew what it was, it was like, 'Oh my God, it's right there,'" said [JA]. "All we can do now is advocate and tell people about this tree and make sure people know about it."

Pibbles and FamBam Rescue focuses on pit bulls who have medical needs or are seniors. Wilfred came to them as a rescue last year [2020] and was recovering from valley fever. Grace was [JA]'s own dog. [JA] says Wilfred and Grace were the best of friends.

Last Monday [16 Aug 2021], after a monsoon storm blew through the valley, [JA] woke up to a mess in her yard. "Nothing came down but just leaves everywhere like a tornado came through," she explained. "We go out at 6 o'clock in the morning, and I saw these pods but didn't know what they were, and Wilfred did try to pick them up, and I said 'don't, don't touch that.' And I kind of threw it in the grass."

Wilfred and Grace have a doggy door and are free to go in and out as they please. When [JA] came home after a doctor's appointment, she discovered Wilfred had thrown up. At the time, [JA] didn't think much of it because Wilfred has some stomach issues already. When Wilfred threw up again, Grace ate some of it before [JA] discovered it.

As [JA] cleaned it up, Wilfred became sicker and sicker. "I was like, wait, did he eat something? Because he also looked like his face was a little swollen, almost like he'd gotten into something and I asked, 'dude, what did you get into?' I'm looking and ask, was it that thing? The thing which was all spiky? And I'm looking all over my yard, and I can't find them," [JA] said.

She immediately called around to veterinarians, who were mostly stumped as to what it could be. "My other vet, one of their wives is a horticulturist, for planting, and they said it's a Red Giant and that's a ricinus tree with ricin," [JA] said.

She then called the ASPCA hotline, who said to get her dogs to an emergency vet. All they could do, though at that point, was supportive care.

Wilfred and Grace were given fluids, and their stomachs were pumped. [JA] said both dogs appeared to be their normal selves, but vets were doubtful. Day by day, both dogs got sicker. Wilfred died on Thursday [19 Aug 2021] during a blood transfusion, and Grace had to be euthanized the next day [20 Aug 2021].

"Only a small amount can be pretty toxic. It's not a death sentence, about 10% of dogs die or are euthanized because of this, but it is pretty serious," said Dr. Rachael Kreisler, an associate professor of shelter medicine and epidemiology at Midwestern University in Glendale. "It doesn't take many seeds to poison a medium-sized dog."

Dr. Kreisler said it's worse for dogs who are chewers if the beans or seeds are broken up when they ingest them. She says at first, much like with [JA]'s case, the signs are nonspecific signs and could be missed.

"So they have a decreased appetite, they're maybe drinking a little bit more, they're probably maybe a little bit weak," Dr. Kreisler explained. "The reason it's such a bad thing for the body is it stops you from making protein."

Dr. Kreisler says time is of the essence if you think your pet ate something poisonous and you should call your vet and the ASPCA hotline right away. She said other toxic plants in Arizona include sago palms, oleanders and lilies.

"The veterinarian may direct you to induce vomiting, but please don't do it on your own," Dr. Kreisler suggested. [JA] said she found the Red Giant Castor in her neighbor's yard, who happens to be a landscaper. He said he had no idea the plant was so dangerous and removed it right away.

"They didn't know what it was, and they feel horrible, and I don't blame them. It's just frustrating -- we have control over what's in our yard in terms of knowing what's growing and knowing what's poisonous and what's not, but we don't have control over what's in other people's yards," said [JA].

Most castor bean plants have similar pods; however, the color may differ. Likewise, the leaves are usually large and palmately veined and may vary from reddish to various hues of green. The pods are usually a roundish structure with many spikes protruding from the round structure. The seeds are inside the pod and are a variegated brown.

"Ricin, a lectin from the castor bean plant (_Ricinis communis_), is considered one of the most potent plant toxins. Ingestion of masticated seeds results in high morbidity, with vomiting and watery to hemorrhagic diarrhea. The prognosis varies with the number of seeds ingested, the degree of mastication, individual susceptibility, and the delay in treatment" (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17402623/).

"The plant (_Ricinus_ sp.) contains a highly toxic glycoprotein called ricin and [ricinine], an alkaloid found in both the seeds and leaves. Ricin is a glycoprotein preventing protein synthesis; when ingested, clinical signs of [inappetence], drooling, abdominal pain, vomiting, severe bloody diarrhea, abdominal straining, weakness, trembling, hypotension (drop in blood pressure), and sudden collapse may be seen. This plant has a very narrow margin of safety; only a small amount ingested can result in severe poisoning. Death can occur with even a very small ingestion of the beans" (https://www.petpoisonhelpline.com/poison/castor-bean-2/).

"_Ricinus communis_ L. (that is, castor bean, mole bean, Palma Christi, wonder tree, African coffee tree, Mexico weed) is an ornamental plant introduced from the West Indies. It produces oil used for industrial and medicinal purposes (1,19). The residual plant material from the oil extraction, castor bean cake, is largely used as fertilizer. The plant contains ricin, a phytotoxin (lectin), considered one of the most potent plant toxins and is listed as a Category B bioterrorism agent by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (15). All parts of the plant are toxic, but the highest levels of ricin can be found in the hard tick-like seeds, which need to be crushed or broken to release the toxic component (20). The toxic lectin inhibits protein synthesis, leading to cell death, and can affect different species of domestic mammals and poultry, but also humans (3,7,13)" (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/104063871002200325).

Please consider looking around at your trees and your neighbor's trees so you can identify them, and be prepared to protect your pets when a windy storm comes through your area.
