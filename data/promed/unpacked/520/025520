Nearly 100 impala have died of suspected anthrax in Zimbabwe's tourist-loved Mana Pools National Park, home to the wild dogs made famous in the recent BBC documentary series, Dynasties. Zimbabwe state wildlife authority spokesperson Tinashe Farawo confirmed the outbreak on [Tue 4 Dec 2018].

Anthrax can be fatal to humans though there are no reports of any human infections in this outbreak. Vets sent to the area have managed to bring the disease under control, Farawo told News24. "We've managed to contain the disease. Our vet doctors are down there: they are working flat out to ensure that we clear the area," he said in a phone interview. "We are trying to avoid the spread of the disease to other species. At the moment we are dealing with impalas only," he added.

Anthrax isn't uncommon in Zimbabwe's wildlife and farming areas. The spores that trigger the disease remain dormant in the soil until they're ingested by wild animals or livestock.

[This popular national park is in northern Zimbabwe on the Zambezi river, in Mashonaland West Province. It falls under the ambit of the Hurungwe Rural District Council for higher level administrative purposes. There are over 20 000 sq km (about 7700 sq mi) of wildlife protected land in the vicinity of Manapools. It is a region of the lower Zambezi River in Zimbabwe where the flood plain turns into a broad expanse of lakes after each rainy season. As the lakes gradually dry up and recede, the region attracts many large animals in search of water, making it one of Africa's most renowned game-viewing regions. It is a 219 600 ha [about 543 000 acres] wildlife conservation area

Mana means 'four' in Shona, in reference to the 4 large permanent pools formed by the meanderings of the middle Zambezi. These 2500 square kilometres (about 965 sq mi) of river frontage, islands, sandbanks and pools, flanked by forests of mahogany, wild figs, ebonies, and baobabs, is one of the least developed national parks in Southern Africa. It has the country's biggest concentration of hippopotami and crocodiles and large dry season mammal populations of the zebra, elephant, and Cape buffalo. The area is also home to other threatened species including the lion, cheetah, Cape wild dog, and near-threatened species including leopard and the brown hyena.

When the area was inscribed by UNESCO, it was one of the most important refuges for eastern black rhinoceros populations in Africa, with about 500 animals. By 1994, poaching had reduced these to just 10 remaining rhinos, which were removed to another area for their protection (https://theafricanbilingual.com/mana-pools-national-park-zimbabwe/)

So, the local concern about this outbreak in impala is clear.
