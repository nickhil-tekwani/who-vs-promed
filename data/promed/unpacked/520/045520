[Newcastle disease (ND), a viral disease reportable to the OIE, is caused by virulent strains of avian paramyxovirus type 1 (APMV-1) of the genus _Avulavirus_ belonging to the family _Paramyxoviridae_. There are ten serotypes of avian paramyxoviruses designated APMV-I to APMV-10.

ND virus (NDV) has been shown to be able to infect over 200 species of birds, but the severity of disease produced varies with both host and strain of virus. Even APMV-1 strains of low virulence may induce severe respiratory disease when exacerbated by the presence of other organisms or by adverse environmental conditions. The preferred method of diagnosis is virus isolation and subsequent characterization.

NDV is a human pathogen and the most common sign of infection in humans is conjunctivitis that develops within 24 hours of NDV exposure to the eye. Reported infections have been non-life threatening and usually not debilitating for more than a day or two. There is no evidence of human-to-human spread.

Since its recognition in 1926, ND is regarded as being endemic in many countries. Prophylactic vaccination is practiced in all but a few of the countries that produce poultry on a commercial scale.

No outbreaks of Newcastle disease (NCD) have been reported by Bulgaria during the years 2014 and 2915. During 2016, 6 outbreaks were reported. The new outbreak in the village Sinitevo, Pazardzhik province (map at http://tinyurl.com/yacluhhs) has been preceded by 3 earlier outbreaks notified by Bulgaria since the start of 2017. Two of them were declared resolved (on 2 Sep and 13 Oct 2017) and one, notified on 25 Oct 2017, is still regarded "continuing" (see map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=25105).

For additional information on ND and NDV, please refer to http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.03.14_NEWCASTLE_DIS.pdf.

The current outbreak in Bulgaria is yet to be notified to the OIE. - Mod.AS
