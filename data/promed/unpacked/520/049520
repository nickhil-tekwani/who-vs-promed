Republic of Congo: Wildlife Surveys in the Cuvette-Ouest Region
---------------------------------------------------------------
The recent human outbreak of Ebola hemorrhagic fever in the Republic of
Congo's Cuvette-Ouest region started when 5 hunters became ill after emerging
from the forest. The 1st hunter died around the 25/26 Apr 2005, and the last
on 11 May 2005. Considering that the incubation period is approximately 7-10
days (range 3-14), they probably became infected around 15-22 Apr 2005.
Subsequent diagnostics by Institut de Recherche et de Developpement (Dr. Eric
Leroy and colleagues, IRD) at the Centre International de Recherches Medicales
de Franceville (CIRMF) isolated Ebola virus from one human victim. The
Conservation et utilisation rationnelle des Ecosystemes Forestiers d'Afrique
Centrale (ECOFAC) immediately sent out survey teams in those areas where the
hunters likely came in contact with the virus. Carcasses were discovered in
this initial survey: 4 gorillas and 2 monkeys (species not identified). One
gorilla carcass was found the day it died, 17 May 2005 -- indicating that if
the gorilla died of Ebola fever, then the animal epidemic was still occurring
at that time. The carcasses were located roughly 30-40 km east northeast of
Mbomo and 48 km north northeast of Etoumbi (the towns where the hunters died).
Wildlife surveys and sampling efforts are now underway in this zone to
understand the impact on wildlife and distribution of animal mortality and
will include collection of diagnostic samples from necropsies and feces. 2
survey teams are currently deployed. The 1st survey team, led by Dr. Alain
Ondzie and Zorine N'kouantsi of the Wildlife Conservation Society's Field
Veterinary Program, is currently moving along a 28-mile route through the
forest south of the Mambili River. They will collect samples from all species
of carcasses found as well as ape feces for genetics and development of new
Ebola testing techniques. The 2nd team is lead by Dr. Pierre Rouquet of ECOFAC
who will set up a base camp south of the Mambili River and conduct trips and
respond to carcasses found by teams going on 9-mile survey routes.
There is little to no food or medicine coming into the region. The teams have
seen that even malaria medication was not found in Mbomo, and Dr. Catherine
Atsangandoko, the local practitioner, had little with which to treat her
patients. Fuel availability there and near the border in neighboring Gabon
is severely restricted, further hampering efforts to work in remote areas.
The infected hunters did not admit to eating or touching any ape carcasses.
They said they had eaten elephant, and survey teams have found numerous
elephant carcasses (illegally killed) in the area. The current local belief is
that the hunters died because they went to see a Nganga (witch doctor) for a
blessing before they went elephant hunting, and failed to pay him. Hence, the
Nganga put out a curse on them.
This report was prepared on 2 Jun 2005 by Dr. Patricia Reed of the Wildlife
Conservation Society's Field Veterinary Program, working in the Republic of
Congo and the Republic of Gabon. The current wildlife related field-work is a
Herculean effort of ECOFAC, WCS Congo Program, WCS Field Veterinary Program,
Rennes University, University of Barcelona, Institut de Recherche et de
Developpement, University of Alabama, and CIRMF, in close collaboration with
the Congolese Ministry of Health. Further diagnostic support, if needed, has
been offered by the Robert Koch Institute and the U.S National Institutes of
Health.

ProMED-mail welcomes the opportunity to relay this information on the current
activities of the Field Veterinary program of the Wildlife Conservation
Society in Republic of Congo. Circumstantial evidence supports the current
belief that Ebola virus reaches the human population as a result of the
hunting, slaughter, and consumption of non-human primates and perhaps other
wild mammals, which themselves may succumb to the infection. The primary
reservoir of Ebola virus has remained elusive, and the virus may be maintained
in a species which does not exhibit signs and symptoms of disease. We invite
Dr. Karesh to keep us updated on the progress of the field work. - Mod.CP]
[In 1999 I presented a poster at the annual meeting of the American Society of
Tropical Medicine & Hygiene entitled "Marburg Virus: the Search for the
Source." With its large photo of a charging African elephant it provoked much
mirth among participants. I gave the following reasons for suspecting the
elephant: pygmies are the tribe with the highest filovirus antibody rate in
the Congo; they traditionally hunt elephants; they poke around in elephant
feces to determine how warm the trail is; and 2 fatal cases of Marburg virus
infection were linked to Kitum Cave, in Kenya, which is so big elephants have
been seen inside, carving chunks of mineral-rich rock out with their tusks --
see photos in: http://www.richardpreston.net/guide/hz/download.html ; and
among the thousands of animal species collected and tested in the USA from
around that cave (all negative), none were elephants.
Marburg is the only other virus, with Ebola virus, in the family Filoviridae,
so they might have similar sources. We wish the investigators success in
their collection of mammalian & fecal specimens. - Mod.JW]
