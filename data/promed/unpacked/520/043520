An outbreak of a strange disease has left several pigs in Rwengobe village, Bigodi parish, Busiriba Sub County in Kamwenge district dead. The unidentified disease has claimed 42 pigs in a period of one month. It has now put residents in the area on alert.

In a letter addressed to the Kamwenge district veterinary officer and a copy seen by New Vision, the LC1 chairperson of Rwengobe village, Byarugaba Bernard, said the authorities are now worried that the disease may spread to human beings who are eating the meat from the affected pigs. According to Byarugaba, all of the pigs that have died had similar signs and symptoms, such as fever and a running nose.

Kamwenge district veterinary officer Dr. Kamanyire Alfred said he'd already dispatched a team of veterinary officers to visit the area and assess the situation.

[The "Consultant" Diagnostic Support System for Veterinary Medicine lists 41 differential diagnoses involving porcines with fever and serous nasal discharge. In case human disease is observed in conjunction with the current pig mortality, the list becomes significantly shorter. Results of the undertaken investigation are anticipated with interest. - Mod.AS
