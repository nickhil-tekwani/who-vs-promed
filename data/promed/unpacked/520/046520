----------------------------------------------------------------------
With more than 30 million documented infections and 1 million deaths worldwide, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues unabated. The clinical spectrum of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 2 infection ranges from asymptomatic infection to life-threatening and fatal disease. Current estimates are that approximately 20 million people globally have "recovered"; however, clinicians are observing and reading reports of patients with persistent severe symptoms and even substantial end-organ dysfunction after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Because COVID-19 is a new disease, much about the clinical course remains uncertain -- in particular, the possible long-term health consequences, if any.

Epidemiology
Currently, there is no consensus definition of postacute COVID-19. Based on the COVID Symptom Study, in which more than 4 million people in the US, UK, and Sweden have entered their symptoms after a COVID-19 diagnosis, postacute COVID-19 is defined as the presence of symptoms extending beyond 3 weeks from the initial onset of symptoms and chronic COVID-19 as extending beyond 12 weeks. [1] It is possible that individuals with symptoms were more likely to participate in this study than those without them.

Previously described, postacute syndrome is well recognized in patients who are recovering from a serious illness, in particular an illness that required hospitalization and admission to the intensive care unit. In a 2016 study among 43 patients who had been discharged after intensive care unit stay (46% required mechanical ventilation), 36 (84%) reported impairment in cognition, mental health, or physical function that persisted for 6 to 12 months beyond hospital discharge, collectively known as post-intensive care syndrome. [2] In a study from Italy that assessed COVID-19 symptom persistence among 143 patients discharged from the hospital, only 18 patients (12.6%) were completely free of any COVID-19-related symptoms after a mean of 60 days after initial symptom onset. [3]

However, postacute COVID-19 syndrome is not just observed among patients who had severe illness and were hospitalized. In a telephone survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention among a random sample of 292 adults (18 years or older) who had a positive outpatient test result for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, 35% of 274 symptomatic respondents reported not having returned to their usual state of health 2 weeks or more after testing, including 26% among those aged 18-34 years (n = 85), 32% among those aged 35-49 years (n = 96), and 47% among those aged 50 years or older (n = 89). [4] Older than 50 years and the presence of 3 or more chronic medical conditions were associated with not returning to usual health within 14 to 21 days after receiving a positive test result. Notwithstanding, 1 in 5 individuals aged 18-34 years without chronic medical conditions had not yet achieved baseline health when interviewed at a median of 16 days from the testing date.

Manifestations
The most commonly reported symptoms after acute COVID-19 are fatigue and dyspnea. Other common symptoms include joint pain and chest pain. [3] In addition to these general symptoms, specific organ dysfunction has been reported, involving primarily the heart, lungs, and brain. From a pathogenesis standpoint, these complications could be the consequence of direct tissue invasion by the virus (possibly mediated by the presence of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor), profound inflammation and cytokine storm, related immune system damage, the hypercoagulable state described in association with severe COVID-19, or a combination of these factors.

Cardiovascular
Myocardial injury, as defined by an increased troponin level, has been described in patients with severe acute COVID-19, along with thromboembolic disease. Myocardial inflammation and myocarditis, as well as cardiac arrhythmias, have been described after SARS-CoV-2 infection. In a German study of 100 patients who recently recovered from COVID-19, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (performed a median of 71 days after COVID-19 diagnosis) revealed cardiac involvement in 78% and ongoing myocardial inflammation in 60%. [5] The presence of chronic comorbidities, duration and severity of acute COVID-19 illness, and time since original diagnosis did not correlate with these findings. However, the sample was not random and likely biased toward patients with cardiac findings. Nevertheless, among 26 competitive college athletes who received a diagnosis of COVID-19 by RT-PCR, none of whom required hospitalization and the majority without reported symptoms, 12 (46%) had evidence of myocarditis or prior myocardial injury by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging routinely performed for positive testing results (range, 12-53 days later). [6] The durability and consequences of such imaging findings are not yet known and longer follow-up is needed. However, an increased incidence of heart failure as a major sequela of COVID-19 is of concern, with considerable potential implications for the general population of older adults with multimorbidity, as well as for younger previously healthy patients, including athletes.

Pulmonary
In a study of 55 patients with COVID-19, at 3 months after discharge, 35 (64%) had persistent symptoms and 39 (71%) had radiologic abnormalities consistent with pulmonary dysfunction such as interstitial thickening and evidence of fibrosis. [7] Three months after discharge, 25% of patients had decreased diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide. In another study of 57 patients, abnormalities in pulmonary function test results obtained 30 days after discharge, including decreased diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide and diminished respiratory muscle strength, were common and occurred in 30 patients (53%) and 28 patients (49%), respectively. [8] If compounded on cardiovascular comorbidity, either preexisting or incident from COVID-19, persistent decline in lung function could have major adverse cardiopulmonary consequences.

Neurologic
SARS-CoV-2 can penetrate brain tissue via viremia and also by direct invasion of the olfactory nerve, leading to anosmia. To date, the most common long-term neurologic symptoms after COVID-19 are headache, vertigo, and chemosensory dysfunction (such as anosmia and ageusia). Although stroke is a serious albeit uncommon consequence of acute COVID-19, encephalitis, seizures, and other conditions such as major mood swings and "brain fog" have been reported up to 2 to 3 months after initial illness onset. [9] Past pandemics involving viral pathogens (such as SARS-CoV-1, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [MERS], and influenza) have involved neuropsychiatric sequelae that could linger for months in "recovered" patients, which can seriously threaten cognitive health, overall well-being, and day-to-day functional status.

Emotional health and well-being
In addition to symptom persistence and clinical sequelae that may last far beyond the initial COVID-19 illness, the extent of emotional and behavioral concerns and general distress for those affected has yet to be determined. A diagnosis of COVID-19, and subsequent need for physical distancing, has been associated with feelings of isolation and loneliness. [10] COVID-19-related stigma has also become pervasive and can result in a sense of hopelessness. Increasing reports of lingering malaise and exhaustion akin to chronic fatigue syndrome may leave patients with physical debility and emotional disturbance. Compounded by the psychological toll of the pandemic experienced population wide, individuals recovering from COVID-19 may be at even greater risk of depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and substance use disorder. These combined effects have the potential to result in a global health crisis, considering the sheer number of COVID-19 cases worldwide.

Conclusions
Granted that no long-term data of substantial numbers of patients with various presenting symptoms exist and with comparison groups and that it is still early in the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible that large numbers of patients will experience long-term sequelae. Outpatient post-COVID-19 clinics are opening in many localities where large outbreaks have occurred, and the term "long-haulers" has been suggested to refer to these patients. It is imperative that the care of this vulnerable patient population take a multidisciplinary approach, with a thoughtfully integrated research agenda, to avoid health system fragmentation and to allow the comprehensive study of long-term health consequences of COVID-19 on multiple organ systems and overall health and well-being. Furthermore, such an approach will provide the opportunity to efficiently and systematically conduct studies of therapeutic interventions to mitigate the adverse physical and mental health effects among hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people who recover from COVID-19. Longer-ranging longitudinal observational studies and clinical trials will be critical to elucidate the durability and depth of health consequences attributable to COVID-19 and how these may compare with other serious illnesses.

[2] Neurological effects of COVID-19 infection
Date: Wed 6 Oct 2020 6:12 PM EDT
Source: Miami Herald [edited]
https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article246267990.html


Four out of 5 patients with COVID-19 experienced neurological symptoms such as dizziness, confusion, and headaches within a hospital network in Chicago, according to the largest study on the topic since the pandemic began. Patients with encephalopathy -- a general term for a permanent or temporary disease that affects brain function -- were more likely to have worse medical outcomes and were seven times more likely to die from COVID-19 within 30 days of hospitalization than those without it.

Younger patients were more likely to develop neurological symptoms than older ones, despite how severe patients' respiratory systems were attacked. The study was published [5 Oct 2020] in the journal Annals of Clinical and Translational Neurology. The Northwestern University researchers said the "severity and persistence" of "neurologic manifestations" of the coronavirus is increasing, but their frequency "and associated risk factors remain unclear."

"Only 9 months into the pandemic, the long‐term effects of COVID‐19 on the nervous system remain uncertain," the researchers wrote in their study. They note that "broad recognition and screening" for cognitive reactions to the disease may have "potential to improve patient outcomes." That's because the coronavirus doesn't just affect the upper respiratory tract, it also has a "unique ability" to attack multiple organs.

The study looked at the first 509 COVID-19 patients admitted to the Northwestern Medicine Healthcare system, which consists of one academic medical center and 9 other hospitals in the Chicago area, between [5 Mar and 6 Apr 2020]. The majority of patients, 82% or 419 individuals, experienced neurological symptoms during the course of their COVID-19 infection and stayed at the hospital longer than those who did not exhibit cognitive reactions.

The commonest neurologic symptoms included deep muscle aches (45%), headaches (38%), encephalopathy (32%), dizziness (30%), loss of taste (16%), and loss of smell (11%). Strokes, motor and sensory deficits, seizures, and impaired coordination were uncommon, but 134 patients developed severe COVID-19 and required mechanical ventilation.

Patients with encephalopathy were not only 7 times more likely to die than those without altered mental states, but they also stayed 3 times longer in the hospital than others in the study. But it was the age disparity that surprised researchers the most. Younger patients developed these symptoms more often than older patients.

Meanwhile, encephalopathy was commoner among older individuals, who were also more likely to be male and have a history of neurological disorders, cancer, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, diabetes, and high blood pressure, the study said. The researchers said there may be an age gap because doctors may have been more focused on respiratory problems rather than cognitive ones in older patients.

The neurological effects were long-lasting, too: 32% of patients with altered mental function said they could handle "daily activities such as cooking and paying bills", compared to 89% without cognitive issues who were able to manage just fine, study senior author, Dr Igor Koralnik, chief of neuro-infectious disease and global neurology at Northwestern Medicine, told The New York Times.

"This is an important study, since the neurological complications of the infection seem to be frequent and in many cases long lasting, but yet have not received much attention," Dr Avindra Nath, chief of the section on infections of the nervous system at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, told the Times.

The researchers say overcoming COVID-19 doesn't declare the end of a vast journey on its own. Long-term follow-up is necessary in order to understand "the true burden" of these neurological effects and what that might mean for future function.

https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acn3.51210.

The study reports a higher frequency and range of neurologic manifestations, in more than 4/5 of COVID‐19 patients hospitalized in the study sites, than studies reported from China (JAMA Neurol 2020; 77: 683-690; https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2764549) and Europe (Neurology 2020; 95: e1060-e1070; https://n.neurology.org/content/neurology/95/8/e1060.abridgement.pdf).

The study also reported that the likelihood of any neurologic manifestations as a whole was higher in younger patients, while encephalopathy was more frequent in older patients. Risk factors for encephalopathy also included severe COVID‐19 disease and history of any neurological disorder or chronic kidney disease.

We are still in the pandemic wave and long‐term follow‐up is necessary to assess the true burden of neurological sequelae in COVID-19 patients. Whether milder forms occur in non‐hospitalized individuals with COVID‐19 who complain of protracted inability to concentrate or decreased short term memory, this has been reported often enough to warrant further evaluation. Furthermore, prospective cognitive and neurologic‐focused evaluations through specialized clinics dedicated to further diagnostic assessment and tailored rehabilitation needs could play a significant role in recovery of the cases. - Mod.UBA]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 216.

Data by country, area, or territory for 7 Oct 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesOct7_1602165024.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 31.3% of daily case numbers and 39.0% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, maintaining its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 17.2 million cases. The USA and Brazil maintain their dominance (although the daily reports from Brazil are markedly reduced) followed by Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru. Other countries reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours include Canada and Chile. Overall case reports were significantly lower than usual most likely due to continued weekend reporting artifact.

- The European region reported 29.5% of daily case numbers and 21.2% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 6.4 million. Countries not reporting cases today (6 Oct 2020) include Kazakhstan, Belgium, Sweden, and Switzerland. The UK is dominant followed by Russia, then France, Israel, Ukraine, Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, Poland, and Romania.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 7.2% of daily case numbers and 9.8% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of greater than 2.5 million cases. Iraq is dominant followed closely by Iran, Morocco, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, and UAE.

- The African region reported 0.95% of daily case numbers and 2.7% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.2 million cases. Countries not reporting cases in the past 24 hours include Ghana, Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, and Madagascar. South Africa is dominant, followed by Ethiopia, Kenya, Algeria, Nigeria, and Uganda. With the exception of South Africa and Ethiopia, all the named countries reported between 100 and 160 cases each in the past 24 hours.

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.3% of daily case numbers and 0.81% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.63 million cases. As previously, the Philippines maintains its dominance, followed by Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea.

- The South East Asia region reported 29.8% of the daily newly reported cases and 26.5% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 7.5 million cases. As previously, India remains dominant, followed by Indonesia, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Myanmar.

[The USA and India are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations, with India in the 2nd position in terms of cumulative case counts and dominating in terms of newly reported cases. In the past 24 hours, these 2 countries -- India (78 809), followed by the USA (53 478) maintained their dominance. A global total of 5825 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (6-7 Oct 2020).

Countries reporting more than 5000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (10 countries) include India, USA, Brazil (31 404), France (18 746), Argentina (16 447), UK (14 162), Russia (11 115), Colombia (7875), Spain (6645), and Czech Republic (5338). A total of 40 countries have reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 15 of the 40 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, and 10 were from the Americas region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase in case counts by 8%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 1.8%.

Impression: Global 7 day averages have increased with reports from the past 48 hours There is still an apparent decline in reports from India, and Brazil. - Mod.UBA]
