Canterbury's Medical Officer of Health is urging people to thoroughly
heat cocktail sausages before eating them following an outbreak of an
illness among children who had consumed them. Dr Ramon Pink says
cocktail sausages (also known as cheerios or saveloys) should be
heated before they are eaten and should not be offered cold to
children at butcher shops or delicatessens.

An investigation by the Canterbury District Health Board's Community
and Public Health division has found 6 children under 5 years old
with yersiniosis had eaten cocktail sausages. Symptoms of the
infection usually last about 48 hours and include diarrhea, possibly
stomach pains, but usually no vomiting.

Most of the children lived in the south Christchurch area and the
suspected food was purchased in this area. The problem appears to
have occurred from mid October to early November 2007. It is believed
more people, particularly children, could have been affected by the
illness.

The cocktail sausages were given to most of the children over the
counter, a common practice, which has been associated with outbreaks
of _Salmonella_ and _Campylobacter_ in Christchurch in the past.
While cocktail sausages are cooked during their preparation they are
not ready-to-eat foods. Further heating before eating is required to
destroy any bacteria that may have contaminated them after they were
made.

As the scale of the outbreak is unknown, Dr Pink says anyone who has
eaten cocktail sausages purchased from the south Christchurch area
during October-November 2007 and has developed diarrhea and possibly
stomach pains should contact a Community and Public Health Protection
Officer.

[The 2 species of _Yersinia_ associated with foodborne disease are
_pseudotuberculosis_ and _enterocolitica_. The latter species, as
noted in the posting, can be associated with abdominal pain as a
hallmark symptom. As a mesenteric lymphadenitis, yersiniosis can
mimic appendicitis but may also cause infections of other sites such
as wounds, joints, and the urinary tract.

As noted in the FDA "Bad Bug Book"
(<http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~mow/chap5.html>),
"Strains of _Y. enterocolitica_ can be found in meats (pork, beef,
lamb, etc.), oysters, fish, and raw milk. The exact cause of the food
contamination is unknown. However, the prevalence of this organism in
the soil and water and in animals such as beavers, pigs, and
squirrels, offers ample opportunities for it to enter our food
supply. Poor sanitation and improper sterilization techniques by food
handlers, including improper storage, cannot be overlooked as
contributing to contamination." Additionally, some strains of these
organisms can be associated with blood transfusion-associated
illnesses due to an ability to grow at refrigerator temperatures.
