Elk tests positive for bovine tuberculosis
------------------------------------------
Wisconsin got more bad news on the animal health front on Wed 19 Jun when
state officials announced that an elk has tested positive for bovine
tuberculosis on a Manitowoc County elk farm. The finding has prompted
animal health officials to begin examining nearby farms that raise cattle
or goats - two other species that get the disease, which can be transmitted
to humans.
Wisconsin's last case of bovine tuberculosis in elk occurred in 1999. The
last case in cattle happened in Shawano County in 1995. Wednesday's
announcement follows the discovery of chronic wasting disease in wild
white-tailed deer in Dane and Iowa counties - the first positive tests for
the disease east of the Mississippi River.
The Department of Natural Resources is in the early stages of overseeing an
unprecedented killing of 25 000 deer within a 361-square-mile region west
of Madison to stem the spread of the disease.
One possible explanation for chronic wasting disease in Wisconsin is that
captive elk or deer were shipped into Wisconsin from infected areas in the
West, and those animals infected wild deer here.
However, state Agriculture Department officials said there is no link
between the chronic wasting disease outbreak and the elk testing positive
for tuberculosis. "The fact that elks get chronic wasting disease and an
elk has TB is completely coincidental - there is no relationship between
the two diseases," said agriculture department spokeswoman Donna Gilson.
Tuberculosis is a bacterial infection while chronic wasting disease is
caused by an abnormal prion that attacks the brain of elk or deer,
eventually killing the animal, said Wesley Ramage, vice president of the
Wisconsin Commercial Deer & Elk Farmers Association. "The good news to this
is that we test for both diseases, it was discovered, and we are doing
something about it," Ramage said.
The name of the elk farmer was not released Wednesday because the case is
still under investigation, Gilson said. One focus of the investigation is
why four elk herds within a 6-mile radius have tested positive for the
disease (TB) since 1997.
The infected elk on the Manitowoc County farm was killed. The farm has been
under quarantine since mid-April when a preliminary test showed the animal
had the disease. A follow-up was negative and then a longer, more accurate
test revealed on Monday that the elk had TB.
The farmer has the choice of killing his entire herd and getting
compensated through state and federal indemnification programs or
continuing a testing program and killing animals that test positive for the
disease. If the farmer chooses the latter, he cannot market any of his
animals for five years.
Although some elk on Wisconsin farms have been tested for chronic wasting
disease, the elk that had TB was not tested for chronic wasting disease.
Gilson said agriculture officials did not think testing was necessary
because elk from the farm are not believed to have any connection to elk
that have tested positive for chronic wasting disease in the West.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture said that the finding would not change
Wisconsin's status as a TB-free state. The designation is important for
farmers who want to market their animals out of state.

[According to Article 2.3.3.2. of the International Animal Health Code --
2001 of the OIE (modified to US terms, "country" to be replaced by
"State"), a State qualifies as officially free from bovine tuberculosis if
it satisfies the following requirements:
1. Bovine tuberculosis is notifiable;
2. 99.8 percent of the herds in the State have been officially free from
bovine tuberculosis for at least the past 3 years as disclosed by periodic
testing of all cattle in the area to determine the absence of bovine
tuberculosis (periodic testing of all cattle is not required in an area
where a surveillance programme as described in point 4 below reveals that
at least 99.9 percent of the cattle have been in herds officially free from
tuberculosis for at least 6 years);
3. Cattle introduced into the State officially free from bovine
tuberculosis must be accompanied by a certificate from an Official
Veterinarian attesting that they come from a herd of cattle officially free
from bovine tuberculosis or from a State officially free from bovine
tuberculosis;
4. A State officially free from bovine tuberculosis must have a Veterinary
Administration which should be able to trace and test the herd of origin of
any reactor to a tuberculin test disclosed after removal from the
considered territory. Also animals which disclosed gross pathological
lesions of tuberculosis in an abattoir or elsewhere. In addition, such a
country or zone must have in place a surveillance programme to ensure the
discovery of bovine tuberculosis should the disease be present in the
country or zone, through slaughter monitoring and/or tuberculin testing. -
