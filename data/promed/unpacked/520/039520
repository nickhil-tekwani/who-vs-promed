The Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus has been the cause of 100-plus human infections in Iran annually since it was first reported about a decade ago. This calendar year in Iran ([Iranian calendar] which begins in March), the Ministry of Health has reported 54 CCHF cases, including 5 deaths, The Tehran Times reports.

Behzad Amiri, head of zoonotic diseases department at the Ministry of Health noted the disease incidence is especially high over warm seasons because the ticks become more active. According to WHO, CCHF is a widespread disease caused by a tickborne virus (_Orthonairovirus_) of the Nairoviridae family. The CCHF virus causes severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40%.

CCHF is endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East, and Asian countries south of the 50th parallel north - the geographical limit of the principal tick vector.

Since the beginning of the current [Iranian calendar] year (21 Mar), 54 people have been diagnosed with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever [CCHF] and 5 of them lost their lives, said Behzad Amiri, head of zoonotic diseases department at the ministry of health. According to Amiri, over the last year, 84 cases of the disease were detected and 8 people died of it, ISNA reported on [Tue 9 Jul 2019].

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever was first spotted in Iran in [calendar] year 1387 (March 2008-March 2009); ever since, 1424 people have been diagnosed with the disease and 190 of them have died, said Amiri. Sistan-Baluchestan, Khorasan Razavi, Kerman, Isfahan, Fars, and Mazandaran are the provinces that have the highest rate of the disease, respectively, he said.

Over the last 20 years, 851 cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever have been reported in Sistan-Baluchestan province alone, he added. Amiri noted the disease incidence is especially high over warm seasons because the ticks become more active. "The disease is mainly transmitted through infected meat; so it is vital that the Veterinary Organization closely examine the livestock that are going to be consumed; moreover, people should be careful not to buy contaminated meat," he continued. "Our top priority is teaching the personnel of slaughterhouses to prevent the spread of the disease. For example, workers need to maintain their personal hygiene; they also must ensure that all animals that are suspected with having an infection are put in quarantine."

According to health ministry, annually, some 100 to 150 cases of Crimean-Congo fever are reported in Iran. According to WHO, the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus causes severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks. CCHF outbreaks have a case fatality rate of up to 40%. The virus is primarily transmitted to people from ticks and livestock animals. Human-to-human transmission can occur resulting from close contact with the blood, secretions, organs, or other bodily fluids of infected persons.

[CCHF is an acute viral illness characterized by high-grade fever and hemorrhagic manifestations. The CCHF virus is mainly transmitted by ticks and may be associated with sporadic to severe outbreaks in humans. As such, the CCHF virus is not pathogenic for ruminants, which are considered amplifying hosts (http://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/crimean-congo-haemorrhagic-fever/en/).

Based on the report above, a total of 54 cases of CCHF have been reported from different regions of Iran, with 5 deaths, during the current season. As reported, the outbreaks are under control due to the use of pesticide spray. Timely detection and management of CCHF cases can help reduce the case fatality, while integrated management of the tick vector through the One Health approach is also important for the prevention of disease.

As an approved vaccine for prevention of disease is not available, there is need to reduce the risk of infection among the high-risk population, such as animal handlers, through awareness campaigns. Moreover, as CCHF has the potential to cause nosocomial infections and outbreaks, controlling infection in healthcare settings through an effective infection prevention and control program at the facility level is equally important. - Mod.UBA
