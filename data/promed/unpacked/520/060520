Health officials have been continuing their investigation into an
outbreak of salmonellosis at a hospital after a further 3 cases were
identified. NHS (National Health Service) Fife said 9 people at Queen
Margaret Hospital in Dunfermline have been infected with the bug.
A probe was launched in March 2007, after 6 cases were detected. A
further 3 have now been confirmed. The source of the bug has not yet
been found. The majority of those who have contracted the bacteria
are patients but a small number of staff have also been affected.
Health chiefs have written to GPs (general practitioners) advising
them to look out for anyone who develops symptoms after being treated
at the hospital.

[Although not specifically stated, it is probable that the 3
additional cases of salmonellosis (subtype not stated) were found as
part of a retrospective study and occurred at the same time as the
original 6. If not, the vehicle for transmission (most probably food)
is still being served. It would be of interest to know whether any of
the hospital staff affected were food workers.
