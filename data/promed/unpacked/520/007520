South Korea - A provincial government in South Korea indefinitely closed
all livestock markets Monday [3 Apr 2000 amid increasing fears the deadly
foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) could become a national epidemic. Kyonggi
province, which surrounds but does not include the capital Seoul, said it
will close all 32 livestock markets to prevent further spread of the fatal
ailment. Other provinces and cities are expected to follow suit, officials
said.
Since symptoms of FMD began showing up around 20 Mar 2000 at 2 farms in
Paju in Kyonggi province, north of Seoul, several more farms farther south
are believed to have been infected. "The problem requires an all-out
government effort to be controlled. It threatens to become a national
epidemic," Agriculture Minister Kim Sung-hoon told a Cabinet meeting.
The government confirmed Sunday the disease in Paju was FMD. It was the
first confirmed outbreak of the disease in Asia since it wiped out nearly
all of Taiwan's pigs 3 years ago. Seoul has not confirmed whether the
illness in other areas was the same disease. FMD is highly communicable and
can kill carrier animals and ruin entire beef and milk-cow herds. It cannot
be passed to people [There are reports of transmission to humans. See
Bauer, K. 1997. Foot- and-mouth disease as zoonosis. Arch Virol Suppl.
13:95-7. - Man. Ed. DS

Japan has also reported suspected outbreaks of the disease in 19 cows on 2
farms since Saturday, and officials are testing thousands more. That
prompted Japan and South Korea to suspend imports of beef and pork from
each other. Australia, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore banned imports from
both countries. China prepared to join them. In North Korea, which suffers
from chronic food shortages, the government has not confirmed any cases.
But South Korean intelligence officials said the ailment may have cropped
up there.
Last weekend, Hongsong, a major cattle growing area 60 miles south of
Seoul, became the second region to be hit by the suspected disease. So far,
hundreds of cattle and pigs have been slaughtered.Over the weekend, Yongi
and Hwasong, 2 more villages along the western coast about 50 miles away
from Hongsong, reported their cattle and pigs had blisters in their mouths,
typical symptoms of the disease. Authorities sealed off the areas and began
inoculating hundreds of thousands of animals. Officials slaughtered
infected livestock, burned barns and banned imports of Chinese hay
suspected of having transmitted the disease.Soldiers set up roadblocks and
let vehicles and travelers pass only after being thoroughly fumigated or
sanitized. But officials fear the highly contagious disease might already
have spread.
The outbreak of the disease is threatening South Korea's farm industry.
South Korea last year exported 89,000 tons of pork to Japan. It exports
little beef.
