Ebola haemorrhagic fever in Gabon - WHO Update 2
------------------------------------------------
GENEVA: A team of scientists from the World Health Organization
(WHO) and its partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response
Network has arrived in Gabon to help coordinate the international
response to an outbreak of Ebola haemorrhagic fever in the Ogooue-
Ivindo Province in the northeastern part of the country.
Laboratory testing carried out at the Centre International de Recherches
MÃ©dicales de Franceville (CIRMF) in Gabon indicates that the cause of
the haemorrhagic fever outbreak is Ebola virus. For Gabon, this is the
fourth Ebola outbreak since 1994. All outbreaks have been in the
central and northeastern regions of the country. As of Wed 12 Dec
2001, WHO has received reports of 10 deaths from haemorrhagic fever
among a total of 12 suspected cases [including one confirmed. -
Mod.JW.
The Gabon Ministry of Health has established a national task force for
managing the response to the epidemic. WHO is supporting the
Ministry of Health and this Task Force in disease containment by:
- coordinating the international response to the outbreak;
- implementing disease control measures, such as barrier nursing
procedures;
- finding cases, tracing contacts and monitoring them;
- supplying protective equipment.
Dr Ray Arthur, an expert virologist, and a team of 3 colleagues from
WHO headquarters in Geneva, Dr Adamou Yada from the WHO
African Regional Office, together with Dr Herve Zeller from Institute
Pasteur in Paris, France, have arrived in Gabon. Other partners in the
Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network are expected to arrive
soon in Gabon. "WHO and its partners will work with the Gabonese
authorities to contain the disease and to prevent any potential spread in
local communities. It is very important that there is an effective and
coordinated international response to this outbreak," said Dr Mike
Ryan, Coordinator of Global Alert and Response at WHO headquarters.
Ebola haemorrhagic fever is one of the most virulent viral diseases
known to humankind, causing death in 50-90% of cases. Ebola virus is
transmitted by direct contact with the blood or body fluids of infected
persons. Ebola virus was first identified in 1976 in the western
equatorial province of Sudan and in the nearby region of Yambuku,
northern Democratic Republic of the Congo (then Zaire).
Gabon's first verified Ebola outbreak occurred in December 1994 in
gold mining encampments. Investigators studying the outbreak were
told of unexplained deaths of great apes, gorillas, and chimpanzees, but
no dead animals were found. The outbreak ended 6 weeks later. In
1996, 2 other Ebola epidemics were confirmed in the spring and fall. In
early February 1996, about 40 km south (7 hours by boat) from the
1994 outbreak, 13 people became ill after butchering a dead
chimpanzee they had found. In October of that year, another Ebola
epidemic was confirmed in the same general region.
