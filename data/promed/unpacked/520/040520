We have been informed that serum neutralisation tests (SNT) were completed over the weekend in the FMD diagnostic laboratory on the 3 sera samples received from the suspected cattle holding in Rafah last week. The 3 samples were found negative to FMDV serotypes O and Asia 1. Two of the sera tested for FMDV-A were found negative; one was inconclusive (titer 1:32). Two of the 3 sera were found positive (1:45) to FMDV serotype SAT 2.

[Earlier (see 20130321.1597508), the 3 sera were found NSP ELISA positive, a finding regarded as indicating past infection with a (not serotyped) FMDV field strain. LPB ELISA revealed no antibodies against serotypes O, Asia 1 and SAT 2, while 2 of the sera were positive for serotype A. The laboratory suspected "cross reactivity."

The SNT results mean that FMDV SAT 2 cannot be ruled out as the causative agent of the Rafah event.

It is recommended that "probang" samples (esophageal epithelium) be collected from the affected (convalescent) calves for conclusive testing, preferably including virus isolation.

During 2012, 3 FMDV serotypes were circulating in Egypt: SAT-2, O, and A; surveillance details are included in a December 2012 presentation at http://www.rr-middleeast.oie.int/download/presentation/FMD%20Egypt.pdf. For genotyping results of the said 3 strains, see http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/africa/egy.htm. - Mod.AS
