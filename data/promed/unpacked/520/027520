The state continues to scrutinize a pet turtle and owl pellets while trying
to nail down the cause of a salmonella outbreak at Jefferson Elementary
School in Franklin, Massachusetts. As of yesterday, 27 Jun 2006, 23
confirmed cases of salmonella, mostly among 5th-grade students, had been
reported to the state Department of Public Health, according to the
department's spokesman.
"Originally, 40 to 50 kids were sick, and we've confirmed 23 cases through
stool samples," said DPH spokeswoman Donna Rheaume. "We're testing the owl
pellets and turtle water to see whether we can grow salmonella from the
cultures." Rheaume said the state will probably pinpoint the cause next
week.
The DPH launched an investigation on 16 Jun 2006, when several Jefferson
5th-graders were diagnosed with the bacterial infection. In the last 11
days, the confirmed cases have jumped from to 6 to 11, and now, to nearly 2
dozen. The state quickly ruled out cafeteria food as the culprit, Rheaume
said. "We're looking at common events (the students experienced)," she said.
Rheaume said the state is closely examining water in a pet turtle's aquarium
and owl pellets, which were dissected in a 5th-grade science experiment.
Salmonella outbreaks have been linked to owl pellets, a summer 2005 report
of the Minnesota Department of Health shows. According to the Minnesota
DPH's Acute Disease Investigation and Control Section, the failure to
sanitize a cafeteria table after dissecting the owl pellets led to 40 cases
of salmonella.
Salmonella can be spread by reptiles, which shed the bacteria in their feces
and spread it through their aquariums as they move. If a person touches a
reptile or its aquarium and does not wash his or her hands, the bacteria can
spread to a person's mouth.

[It remains unclear whether the turtle aquarium or owl pellets represent the
source of the salmonellosis outbreak. The serotype of salmonella is not
given, which might be helpful. Now, 23 documented cases of salmonellosis
have occurred. The total number of 5th graders exposed is not stated.
More on owl pellets: Like all birds, owls have no teeth to chew their food.
Their food is usually swallowed whole, or in large chunks. After an owl
swallows a mouse, strong acids in the owl's stomach begin to digest the
mouse's muscle and other soft parts. The owl can't digest the bones and fur
that come along with the meal, so the owl's stomach forms these indigestible
materials into tight packages called pellets. Several hours after a meal, an
owl will regurgitate one of these pellets. The pellets, along with feathers
and other remains, can be found under owl roosts.
