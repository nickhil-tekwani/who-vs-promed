California animal health officials have confirmed the state's 2nd equine case of West Nile virus (WNV) for 2016.

"On 11 Jul 2016, an unvaccinated yearling filly in Sacramento County displaying hind limb ataxia (incoordination) was confirmed positive for West Nile virus (WNV)," a statement from the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) said. "The onset of clinical signs began on 26 Jul [Likely this is supposed to be 26 Jun as this is currently 21 Jul 2016. - Mod.TG]. The filly is alive."

The CDFA said 2 California horses -- the filly in Sacramento County and a horse in San Diego County -- have tested positive for WNV thus far in 2016.

"Both horses were unvaccinated (and) both horses were alive and recovering at the time of confirmation," the CDFA said.

West Nile is transmitted to horses via bites from infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs for WNV include flulike signs, where the horse seems mildly anorexic and depressed; fine and coarse muscle and skin fasciculations (twitching); hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound); changes in mentation (mentality), when horses look like they are daydreaming or "just not with it"; occasional somnolence (drowsiness); propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control); and "spinal" signs, including asymmetrical weakness. Some horses show asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia. Equine mortality rate can be as high as 30-40 percent.

The clinical signs of WNV can be consistent with other important neurologic diseases such as equine encephalitis, rabies, and equine herpesvirus; therefore it is important to work with your veterinarian to get an accurate diagnosis through laboratory testing.

Horse owners should also consult their private practicing veterinarian to determine an appropriate disease prevention plan for their horses. Vaccines have proven to be a very effective prevention tool. Horses that have been vaccinated in past years will need an annual booster shot. However, if an owner did not vaccinate their animal in previous years, the horse will need the 2-shot vaccination series within a 3- to 6-week period.

In addition to vaccinations, horse owners also need to reduce the mosquito populations and their possible breeding areas. Recommendations include removing stagnant water sources, keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, which are typically early in the morning and evening, and using mosquito repellents.

[Mosquito-borne diseases include eastern and western and Venezuelan equine encephalitis and West Nile virus. These vaccines (perhaps minus the Venezuelan strain) are often combined into one vaccine. Prevention of these diseases is simple and easy. There are also mosquito repellants specifically for use on the horse that should be used. - Mod.TG
