--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract
--------
Background: Following the emergence of the omicron variant of concern (VOC), we investigated immunogenicity, efficacy and safety of BNT162b2 or mRNA1273 4th dose in an open-label, clinical intervention trial.

Methods: Primary end-points were safety and immunogenicity and secondary end-points were vaccine efficacy in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 symptomatic disease. The 2 intervention arms were compared to a matched control group. Eligible participants were healthcare workers (HCW) vaccinated with 3 BNT162b2 doses and whose IgG antibody levels were â‰¤700 BAU (40 percentile). IgG and neutralizing titers, direct neutralization of live VOCs, and T-cell activation were assessed. All participants were actively screened for SARS-CoV-2 infections on a weekly basis.

Results: Of 1050 eligible HCW, 154 and 120 were enrolled to receive BNT162b2 and mRNA1273, respectively, and compared to 426 age-matched controls. Recipients of both vaccine types had a ~9-10-fold increase in IgG and neutralizing titers within 2 weeks of vaccination and an 8-fold increase in live omicron VOC neutralization, restoring titers to those measured after the 3rd vaccine dose. Breakthrough infections were common, mostly very mild, yet, with high viral loads. Vaccine efficacy against infection was 30% (95%CI: -9% to +55%) and 11% (95%CI: -43% to +43%) for BNT162b2 and mRNA1273, respectively. Local and systemic adverse reactions were reported in 80% and 40%, respectively.

Conclusions: The 4th COVID-19 mRNA dose restores antibody titers to peak post-3rd dose titers. Low efficacy in preventing mild or asymptomatic omicron infections and the infectious potential of breakthrough cases raise the urgency of next-generation vaccine development.

Discussion
----------
[The investigators' results] suggest that the safety profile of the 4th dose is likely similar to that of previous doses.

Overall, these data raise the possibility that the 4th dose does not boost immunity but simply restores it to peak levels. It is yet to be observed whether the waning of this 4th dose will be at a similar rate as that observed after the 3rd dose and whether it will differ between the 2 mRNA vaccine groups.

Overall, during the study period, 25% of the control groups were infected by SARS-CoV-2 and 18-20% of the vaccinated groups had concurrent breakthrough infections, leading to a low vaccine efficacy against infections of 11-30%, with relatively wide confidence intervals. Moreover, most of the infected HCW in all groups complained of only negligible symptoms, which in many cases would not have been tested or reported, without the active surveillance. Yet, most of these infected HCW were potentially infectious, with relatively high viral loads. Thus, the major objective for vaccinating HCW was not achieved. The increased efficacy against symptomatic compared to asymptomatic infections found in this study suggest that the 4th dose may be more efficacious against severe disease and death, as was recently observed (22 [see source URL for complete references]). Therefore, older and vulnerable populations who are at higher risk for severe disease may benefit most from a 4th vaccine dose.

The effectiveness of vaccination against long COVID: a rapid evidence briefing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Key messages
------------
- 15 studies were identified that reported on the effectiveness of vaccination against long COVID (search up to 12 Jan 2022): 7 studies examined whether vaccination before infection reduced the symptoms or incidence of long COVID, 7 studies examined whether vaccination in people with long COVID reduced or cleared the symptoms of long COVID, and 1 study examined both.

- 6 of the 8 studies assessing the effectiveness of vaccination before COVID-19 infection suggested that vaccinated cases (1 or 2 doses) were less likely to develop symptoms of long COVID following infection, in the short term (4 weeks after infection), medium term (12 to 20 weeks after infection) and long term (6 months after infection). As all 8 studies included only participants who had COVID-19, the effect of vaccination on reduced incidence of COVID-19 is not accounted for. This means these studies do not give a total population estimate for the effectiveness of vaccines to prevent long COVID, but rather underestimate it.

- From 2 studies that measured individual long COVID symptoms, fully vaccinated cases were less likely to have the following symptoms in the medium or long term than unvaccinated cases: fatigue, headache, weakness in arms and legs, persistent muscle pain, hair loss, dizziness, shortness of breath, anosmia, interstitial lung disease, myalgia, and other pain.

- In studies examining the effect of vaccination among people with long COVID, 3 of 4 studies comparing long COVID symptoms before and after vaccination suggested that more cases reported an improvement in symptoms after vaccination, either immediately or over several weeks. There were, however, some cases in all studies who reported a worsening in symptoms after vaccination.

- 3 studies of people with long COVID who were unvaccinated when they were initially infected compared people who were subsequently vaccinated and people who remained unvaccinated. All these studies suggested that people with long COVID were less likely to report long COVID symptoms shortly after vaccination, and over longer periods, than people with long COVID who were not subsequently vaccinated. One study looked at the timing of vaccination after COVID-19 diagnosis, and suggested that cases who were vaccinated sooner rather than later after diagnosis were much less likely to report symptoms of long COVID than cases who remained unvaccinated.

- In 3 of the 5 studies reporting on symptom changes following vaccination of people with long COVID, there was a higher proportion of people with long COVID who reported unchanged symptoms following vaccination (up to 70%) than people whose symptoms improved or worsened.

- All studies were observational, so the results may be from differences other than vaccination, and there was large heterogeneity between studies in the definition of long COVID.

[3] Mental health
Date: Wed 16 Feb 2022

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/16/health/covid-depression-anxiety.html


Social isolation, economic stress, loss of loved ones and other struggles during the pandemic have contributed to rising mental health issues like anxiety and depression. But can having COVID itself increase the risk of developing mental health problems? A large new study suggests it can.

The study, published Wednesday [16 Feb 2022] in the journal The BMJ, analyzed records of nearly 154 000 COVID patients in the Veterans Health Administration system and compared their experience in the year after they recovered from their initial infection with that of a similar group of people who did not contract the virus (https://www.bmj.com/content/376/bmj.o415).

Research, including brain autopsies of patients who died of COVID-19, has found evidence that COVID infection can generate inflammation or tiny blood clots in the brain, and can cause small and large strokes, said Dr. [Maura] Boldrini [an associate professor of psychiatry at NewYork-Presbyterian Columbia University Medical Center], who has conducted some of these studies.

In some people, the immune response that is activated to fight against a coronavirus infection may not shut down effectively once the infection is gone, which can fuel inflammation, she said. "Inflammatory markers can disrupt the ability of the brain to function in many ways, including the ability of the brain to make serotonin, which is fundamental for mood and sleep," Dr. Boldrini said.

By themselves, such brain changes may or may not cause psychological problems. But, if someone is experiencing stress from having felt physically ill or because having COVID disrupted their lives and routines, she said, "you may be more prone to not being able to cope because your brain is not functioning 100%."

[From the BMJ article (https://www.bmj.com/content/376/bmj.o415): "Our research catalogues the breadth of post-acute mental health outcomes experienced by people with COVID-19 including depression, anxiety, and stress and adjustment disorders. There was also evidence of increased risk of substance use disorders, neurocognitive decline, and sleep problems. These risks were evident even among those people whose disease was mild and did not require hospital admission for COVID-19.

"Altogether, the findings suggest that people with COVID-19 are experiencing increased rates of mental health outcomes, which could have far-reaching consequences."

See the editorial on mental health after COVID-19, also from the BMJ (https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.o326): "We do not yet know the true incidence and consequences of long COVID (15) and we are still witnessing the unfolding toll of the pandemic on healthcare staff (16). Also, we do not have an effective response to the devastating disruption to health, social care, and voluntary sector services on the lives of people with serious mental illness (17). And while epidemiological research has flourished -- at least in terms of scientific publications -- we are guilty of failing to prioritise evaluations of mental healthcare interventions, including clinical trials, just when these are most needed (18)" [see URL above for complete editorial and references].

The National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) on Monday [14 Feb 2022] announced that Pakistan has achieved another milestone by administering 200 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine.

Also on Monday [14 Feb 2022], the country reported the lowest number of COVID-19 cases since 11 Jan 2022 and the national positivity rate remained at 5.62%.

The NCOC data showed that 200 825 508 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered. As many as 119 150 808 people have received at least one dose of the vaccine and 92 565 125 have been fully vaccinated. Moreover, 3 610 979 people have been inoculated with the booster dose.

It is worth mentioning that 7 vaccines -- Sinopharm, Sinovac, CanSino or Pakvac, Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Sputnik -- are being administered in Pakistan.

The data showed that 2662 people were infected with the virus and 29 COVID-19 patients died on Monday [14 Feb 2022]. It was the lowest number of infections in a single day for over one month. Earlier, 2074 cases were reported on 11 Jan 2022.

While the national positivity rate was 5.62%, only 5 cities reported an over 10% positivity rate. These cities are Mirpur, Muzaffarabad, Skardu, Nowshera, and Karachi. The highest positivity rate was reported by Muzaffarabad, where 17.65% of samples were found positive.

The data further showed that as many as 1566 patients were in critical care on Monday [14 Feb 2022].

https://www.dailymirror.lk/latest_news/Too-premature-to-discuss-a-fourth-COVID-vaccine-dose-Health-authorities/342-231282


The health authorities in Sri Lanka have articulated that it is too premature to have a discussion on a 4th COVID-19 vaccine dose in a situation where the 3rd dose rollout is yet to be completed.

Director General of Health Services Dr Asela Gunawardena told a news briefing yesterday [17 Feb 2022] that they had not arrived at any form of discussions pertaining to a 4th dose.

"However, we have to ponder administering another Pfizer vaccine dose for those are aspiring to go abroad and those who have received Sinopharm as the first 2 doses and the Pfizer as the booster dose," he underscored.

"This depends on the requirement of respective foreign countries that they are hoping to fly to," Dr Gunawardena added.

Health experts worldwide have expressed their viewpoints on the necessity of administering a 4th vaccine dose.

However, Sweden and Israel have already recommended 4th vaccine shots for adults and people 80 and older while South Korea is to begin giving out 4th doses of COVID-19 vaccines.

The South Asia COVID-19 situation, according to data from Worldometer (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) as of 18 Feb 2022 at 04:56 GMT:

Country: Total cases / Total deaths / Deaths per million population
India: 42 780 235 / 510 937 / 364
Bangladesh: 1 926 570 / 28 907 / 173
Pakistan: 1 496 693 / 29 950 / 131
Nepal: 974 857 / 11 911 / 397
Sri Lanka: 633 051 / 15 926 / 739
Afghanistan: 171 673 / 7524 / 186
Maldives: 162 974 / 290 / 522
Bhutan: 8683 / 5 / 6

Over the last 7 days, 244 098, 32 035, 19 120, 3382, and 8506 COVID-19 cases were detected in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, respectively, compared with 585 636, 58 759, 35 310, 8958, and 9886 in the preceding 7 days, revealing a sharp decline in cases in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Nepal, but almost a state of stability in Sri Lanka. The numbers of daily deaths along with the numbers of daily active cases are also substantially decreasing in the most 4 populous countries in South Asia, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal. The daily case positivity against the number of people tested is now around 10% in Bangladesh, 2.6% in India, and 5.6% in Pakistan, as indicated in items [A], [B], and [D] above.

As the COVID-19 cases are sharply dropping in India, the COVID-19 restriction measures imposed across the country to combat the spread of the highly transmissible omicron variant are expected to be ended soon, as hinted in item [B] above. Bangladesh is also considering withdrawing some of the restriction measures imposed earlier. As part of this, schools in the country will reopen from 22 Feb 2022 (https://bdnews24.com/education/2022/02/17/bangladesh-covid-expert-panel-recommends-school-restart-from-feb-22).

As extracted from item [B] above, as many as 7 911 511 COVID-19 cases were detected across India from 1 Jan-17 Feb 2022, and in this window of 48 days, 29 333 people died due to the disease, suggesting a case fatality rate of 0.37%, grossly meaning that if 1000 people were confirmed with the disease by laboratory testing, 3.7 of them died eventually. This rate of mortality is around 3.2 times lower compared with the overall death rate of 1.19%, recorded in India due to the disease as of today (18 Feb 2022) (https://www.mohfw.gov.in/), but 3.6 times lower compared with the death rate (1.32%) recorded on 21 May 2021, 2 weeks later from the highest number of total daily cases (414 433) recorded on 6 May 2021, during the peak of the previous surge in the country believed to be caused by the delta variant (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/india/).

An update on the omicron variant can be seen at https://www.who.int/news/item/28-11-2021-update-on-omicron. Additional information can be found at https://www.unicef.org/coronavirus/what-we-know-about-omicron-variant.

As of 18 Feb 2022, at 08:00 IST (GMT+5:30) India has administered 1 746 499 461 doses of COVID-19 vaccine (https://www.mohfw.gov.in/).

Bangladesh has a plan for vaccinating 70% of the population. As of 16 Feb 2022, 85.09% have received the 1st dose and 62.16% of the target population have received the 1st and 2nd doses. Around 3.9% of the target population have also received a 3rd dose as a booster vaccination (http://103.247.238.92/webportal/pages/covid19-vaccination-update.php).

Pakistan has reached a significant milestone in COVID-19 vaccination as more than 200 million doses of the vaccine have been administered in the country. As of 18 Feb 2022 at 07:16 PKT (GMT+5), a total of 205 527 345 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered in Pakistan (https://ncoc.gov.pk/).

As of 12 Feb 2022, Nepal has administered at least 35 546 280 doses of COVID-19 vaccine (https://covid19.who.int/region/searo/country/np).

Sri Lanka has administered at least 37 080 721doses of COVID vaccines so far. Assuming every person needs 2 doses, that's enough to have vaccinated about 85% of the country's population (https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/countries-and-territories/sri-lanka/).

[In the past 24 hours, 40 countries, including Germany (227 613), Russia (180 622), USA (130 493), Brazil (129 266), South Korea (109 828), Japan (95 603), Turkey (92 406), France (92 345), Indonesia (63 956), Italy (58 055), Netherlands (56 378), UK (51 352), Denmark (38 442), Chile (37 698), Viet Nam (36 200), Spain (34 213), Ukraine (33 330), Austria (30 914), Poland (29 124), Australia (28 298), Malaysia (26 701), India (25 920), Belgium (24 217), Mexico (21 565), Switzerland (19 851), Greece (19 501), Singapore (18 545), Slovakia (18 443), Peru (18 176), Thailand (18 066), Iran (17 545), Norway (17 342), Czech Republic (17 046), Argentina (16 650), Portugal (16 488), Israel (16 257), Georgia (15 644), Romania (15 374), Jordan (15 107), and Latvia (11 595), reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 12 653 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 15 Feb 2022 to late 16 Feb 2022). The exponential rise in cases over the last few weeks can be attributed to the rapid spread of the omicron variant globally. However, the 7-day averages now indicate a decreasing global trend for cases and deaths.

A total of 90 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 49 of the 90 countries are from the European region, 12 are from the Americas region, 13 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, 6 from the South East Asia region, and 4 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 21.3%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 3.9%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 53.1% decrease in daily reported cases and a 21.4% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily report counted over 2.12 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 420.29 million cumulative reported cases and over 5.88 million reported deaths. Despite some decrease in the number of cases, transmission continues at a very high level. - Mod.UBA]
