On the Iron Horse Triathlon Web page the conversation lately has been more
medical than athletic. "Thought it was a sinus problem and ended up on my
back for six days with massive frontal headaches, chills . . . 103-degree
fever," reads one athlete's message on the Springfield-based Internet site.
Another: "Six days without food has left me extremely weak. . . . My liver
enzymes are still off the charts." And another: "Severe backache, high
fever, nausea, extreme fatigue, etc. I tried to treat the fever for three
days while laying in bed the whole time. . . . This has been an alarming
last two weeks."
Health officials say those victims and scores of others are part of what
might be the biggest outbreak recorded in the United States of
leptospirosis, or "swamp fever."
The infection apparently began in Lake Springfield and has hit victims from
all over the country who swam there June 21 as part of the Iron Horse
Triathlon. No one has died, but 84 people in Illinois have reported
symptoms, with at least three more in St. Louis County.
Officials know the waterborne _Leptospira_ bacterium originates in the
urine of animals, and that it can infect humans by seeping through the
membranes of the mouth and eyes. But how it got into Lake Springfield in
high enough concentrations to cause an outbreak is a mystery. "It's the
largest point-source of leptospirosis that we've ever seen," said
epidemiologist David Ashford of the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta,
which is coordinating the effort to track everyone who might have been
infected.
Ashford said that each year about 80 to 150 cases of leptospirosis are
reported nationwide, usually from many limited, unrelated infections caused
by small ponds or swimming pools. (The infection cannot be spread by
humans.)
It's still unknown how many might have been infected in Lake Springfield -
"That number is changing every hour," Ashford said - but officials have
found symptoms in about 12 percent of the people who were exposed to Lake
Springfield last month. There were more than 850 registered participants
from 42 states in the triathlon, including 72 from Missouri, 19 of those
from St. Louis. That means more than 100 participants might be infected,
based on the CDC averages. [Note: 87 have reported symptoms which would be
within the standard error. MHJ And that doesn't include people who swam in
the lake but weren't affiliated with the event.
Lake Springfield remains under an advisory to residents to refrain from
swimming, and most of the beaches are closed. One test by the CDC has
indicated some presence of Leptospira bacteria in the lake, but it's still
unclear whether the concentration is higher than normal. Among the
mysteries facing investigators is how an infection usually associated with
small, stagnant bodies of water could occur in an open, free-flowing lake.
They're also wondering why a recreational lake that has been heavily used
for years with no reported health problems suddenly would spawn such a
widespread infection. State health officials have been testing the
tributaries that feed the lake but have been hampered by dry weather. A
moderate rain early Thursday might have helped the investigation, said
Clint Mudgett, environmental health chief for the Illinois Department of
Public Health, because it allowed scientists to finally gather watershed
runoff samples in conditions similar to those on the morning of the race.
One focus of the investigation is to try to link the infection to a
specific kind of animal urine - a daunting challenge, because the bacteria
can be transmitted by both wild and domestic animals, and the lake is
surrounded by wildlife and farmland.
"There's no shortage of theories," said Mudgett. His own theory - centered
on a large dose of unlucky coincidences - goes like this: "This year, the
wild animal population around the lake is reported to be heavier than it's
ever been. Then you have (almost) 900 swimmers in exactly the same part of
the lake at the same time. There was a very heavy rain that morning
(possibly washing unusually high levels of animal waste into the lake all
at once). You might have just had all these factors coming together."
The triathlon organizer said Thursday there is a new element to the case: a
civil suit by one of the leptospirosis victims, naming the event "and
others" as defendants. "I was served (with notice of a suit) yesterday,"
said Paul McDevitt, who is in his first year as director of the 13-year-old
annual triathlon, in which amateur athletes bicycle, run and swim.
"At the very first sign (of an outbreak) we moved quickly" to work with
health officials, McDevitt said, but added: "The whole tenor of the thing
has changed (with the lawsuit). I have to be careful what I say from here
on out." McDevitt said he couldn't provide more details about the suit. An
employee of the Cook County Circuit Clerk's office couldn't confirm that it
had been filed.
The CDC also is investigating whether a lake used for a Wisconsin triathlon
July 5 might have been another source of infection. Many of the Springfield
triathlon participants who have reported symptoms swam in both lakes. But
officials haven't confirmed that any leptospirosis cases originated in
Wisconsin.
