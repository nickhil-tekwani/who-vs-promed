Prince Edward Island [PEI] has confirmed its 1st case of avian influenza (AI), which was found in a bald eagle on the island's north shore.

The highly pathogenic flu, subtype H5N1, is a serious bird disease that can be diagnosed in wild and domestic flocks and spreads easily and quickly.

"This detection follows confirmed findings of the same pathogenic AI in both Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia," said the province in a news release Wednesday [2 Mar 2022].

PEI is asking the public to help prevent disease spread by not handling or interacting with wild birds. Anyone who witnesses a sick or dead wild bird is asked to contact Fish and Wildlife at 902-368-4683.

Sick or dying domestic birds should be reported to a veterinarian.

More information on avian influenza can be found at https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/information/agriculture-and-land/avian-influenza-ai.

"As this is an evolving issue, the government will continue to monitor the situation and work alongside partners to ensure the health and safety of Islanders and wildlife," wrote PEI. officials.

According to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, avian influenza was also detected in eastern Nova Scotia on [1 Feb2022], in birds in a backyard flock that were not for sale. It was again detected on [3 Feb 2022] but this time in a commercial flock in western Nova Scotia.

Avian flu was also recently found in wild birds in Newfoundland and in a wild goose in central Nova Scotia.

In February [2022], South Korea and the Philippines imposed restrictions on all Canadian poultry products, including live poultry, poultry meat, and edible eggs.

The United States, European Union, Taiwan, Mexico, Japan, and Hong Kong have imposed targeted restrictions on some Nova Scotia products. Russia, meanwhile, has banned imports of poultry from Nova Scotia and from Newfoundland and Labrador.

The Center for Birds of Prey in Awendaw [South Carolina] is temporarily closed to all visitors after avian influenza was detected in the Lowcountry.

The Avian Conservation Center/Birds of Prey said their facilities will be closed to the public until March 8 [2022] "as we elevate our biosecurity protocols to help ensure the health of the birds in our care," the center said.

The 1st case of avian influenza to be detected in the United States since 2016 was confirmed in a wild duck harvested by a hunter in Colleton County back in January [2022].

Additionally, officials said 2 herring gulls admitted to the Medical Clinic had neurologic symptoms and later died while in their care. "The gulls were transferred to the Clemson University Veterinary Diagnostic Center for testing and were determined to have been infected with avian influenza."

The virus is low risk to people but could be a serious threat to South Carolina's poultry industry.

"We are happy to report that our current bird population is showing no clinical signs of avian influenza and we have strengthened biosecurity protocols to keep them safe from the threat of future infection," the center said.

According to the Birds of Prey, the Avian Medical Clinic will continue to receive injured birds until a change in circumstances warrants a revision to that policy.

For those who have purchased tickets to visit the center, organizers will be in contact to reschedule visits.

The center's full announcement is available at https://www.thecenterforbirdsofprey.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/HPAI-Closing-Announcement.pdf.

The Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources (MDAR) is warning farmers who raise birds that contagious avian flu has been found in wild birds in the state.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has been found in wild and domestic birds along the east coast from Canada to Florida, putting domestic poultry in Massachusetts at risk of exposure.

Owners are asked to take steps to keep protect their free-range poultry, including keeping poultry indoors, feeding and watering birds indoors, and preventing access to areas where poultry could come into contact with wild bird droppings. Owners are also asked to watch for early signs of illness.

The MDAR is also asking farmers to report sick and dead birds.

[4] USA (Florida): wild waterfowl

As of [28 Feb 2022], highly pathogenic avian influenza has arrived in Florida via wild waterfowl returning from nesting in the arctic where they are comingled with birds from around the world.

Confirmed cases in wild waterfowl have been reported in Volusia, Brevard, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Palm Beach Counties. The remainder of the state is under surveillance.

According to the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, the United States Department of Agriculture, and the Florida Department of Health as of this writing, No cases of this bird flu have been found in the domestic, backyard, or commercial birds in Florida.

Wild birds, particularly water birds, can carry many strains of low pathogenic avian influenza, most of which do not cause disease in domestic poultry.

However, when a low pathogenic strain undergoes a mutation and forms a highly pathogenic strain, the mutated strain can cause significant disease in domestic poultry.

The HPAI virus is not easily transmissible from birds to humans, but health officials are concerned it could mutate into another form that could spread readily from person to person, triggering a pandemic.

No cases of human infections with HPAI have been reported in the United States as of this writing. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) considers the current risk to the public to below.

As risk depends on exposure, it is best to not touch sick or dead wild birds. If such instances are necessary, persons handling such wild birds should use personal protective equipment such as protective clothing, rubber boots, gloves, eye protection, and face shields.

After handling the bird, these items can be disinfected with a 10% bleach water solution.

To keep domestic, backyard, and commercial flocks free of this virus, it is recommended that all poultry (chickens, ducks, turkeys, geese, etc.) be housed inside a coop with a solid roof and that steps be taken to prevent wild birds from entering the coop.

It is also recommended to limit visits to your coop to only those who regularly handle your poultry. Report sick or dead birds to the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) or your veterinarian.

To help in the tracking of HPAI:
- Report sick or dead commercial or backyard birds to the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS.gov) or your veterinarian,
- Report wild bird mortalities to http://app.myfwc.com/FWRI/AvianMortality/

[The Eurasian H5N1 first detected in January 2022 on the Atlantic coast of North America continues to spread. Some wild migratory waterbirds contribute to the propagation of HPAI viruses. The current propagation of H5N1 in the Americas seems to be associated with the Atlantic Americas flyway.

It is important to take into account that only a few bird species may play a role in the propagation of HPAI viruses. Most wild bird species, as well as poultry and other domestic birds, are neither tolerant nor resistant to HPAI viruses, and thus they become ill and do not move much, which implies that they are poor spreaders and instead may act as sentinels of viral circulation. Only a few species that migrate and can tolerate these viruses, presumably some Anseriformes, are key players driving the spread of this epidemic. - Mod.PMB]
