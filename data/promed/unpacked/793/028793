Outbreaks of Pseudo-Infection with Cyclospora and Cryptosporidium ---
Florida and New York City, 1995:
Efforts to expand the scope of surveillance and diagnostic testing for
emerging infectious diseases also may increase the potential for
identifying pseudo-outbreaks (i.e., increases in incidence that may
result from enhanced surveillance) and outbreaks of pseudo-infection
(i.e., clusters of false-positives for infection). This report describes
the investigations of outbreaks of pseudo-infection with Cyclospora in
Florida and Cryptosporidium in New York City in 1995 after health
departments in those jurisdictions had initiated surveillance for these
emerging organisms. These investigations emphasize 1) the need for
laboratory training in the identification of emerging pathogens and 2)
the importance of confirmation by reference laboratories as an early
step in the investigation of any apparent outbreak caused by an emerging
pathogen.
