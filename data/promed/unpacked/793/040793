9 dead from plague: More than 70 cases now confirmed
---------------------------------------------------
The death toll from the plague outbreak in the Ohangwena
region has now risen to nine while more than 70 cases have
so far been reported.
North West Health Region Director Dr Naftali Hamata told
The Namibian that of the 9 fatalities 5 people died at home
or before they could get treatment at a hospital. Hamata said
some people had not been taken to a clinic or hospital quickly
enough after developing plague symptoms.
He added that the spread of the plague from village to village or
from region to region is being caused mainly by the movement of
people, especially those coming from affected areas. The Health
Director appealed to people not to go to the villages affected by
the plague. He also said people from the affected villages should
not visit other areas as they may be carrying the disease or the
fleas that spread the disease.

The movement of animals could also be a factor in the plague's
spread as they could also carry the fleas that transmit the disease.
Unfortunately the advice about not moving from area to area runs
against the normal lifestyle in the North, where people are used to
visiting relatives in neighbouring areas, particularly if there has been
a death in the family. Animals are also always on the move as the
North is a communal farming area.
Hamata added that people who become sick with the symptoms of
the plague must report to or be taken to the nearest clinic and
hospital immediately for treatment as the plague is curable if treated
early enough.
Symptoms of bubonic plague start to appear between two and six
days after a person has been bitten by an infected flea. Early
symptoms include shivering, vomiting, headache, dizziness,
intolerance to light, pain in the back and limbs and a white coating
on the tongue.
Eventually, pain spreads to areas where the lymph nodes are found,
such as the groin, armpit and neck. As the lymph nodes swell painfully,
hard lumps begin to appear on the inner thigh -- often the first place
where the swelling starts -- and neck and armpit.
There have been plague outbreaks in the North before. The disease
was reported in the 1960s at Onakayale Hospital in the Ombalantu
district. In the 1970s it was reported at Eheke village near Ondangwa
and in what is now the Ohangwena region in the 1970s.

Hamata said a team of health inspectors sent to trap rats at
Oshatotwa and Onandova villages had returned to Oshakati and
samples from the rats and the fleas they carry are being sent to the
South African Institute for Medical Research for scrutiny.
The villages affected by the plague in the Ohangwena region are
Oshatotwa, Otunganga, Oshaango, Onekuta, Oiti Itoka, Onambutu,
Oikalahanye, Onandova, Ongha, Omungholyo, Omatunda in Ohaingu,
Ondobe, Oshela in Onandova, Eenghango, Okauva, Ohaukelo,
Oitapakane, Engelalashikondongolo and Onheleiwa.
