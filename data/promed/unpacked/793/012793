MALARIA, VIVAX, RESISTANT? - PERU: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

A friend of mine is involved with something called Project Amazonas in Peru
(near Iquitos), a non-profit medical education/ecotourism operation
(<http://www.amazon-ecotours.com/pa/>). The friend, Guy Clark, is a
former military medic and is now the Medical Coordinator in the field for
the organization.
He has recently seen a patient with vivax malaria who is not responding to
chloroquine therapy. A Grateful Med Search turns up only one published
report (1996) of chloroquine-resistant vivax malaria in South America (3
cases in Guyana). His note follows:
22 June 1998
We have a _P. vivax_ infection that isn't resolving very well with
chloroquine or hydrochloroquine. Way slower than normal or not at all, I
think.
[I] need more details and info on vivax resolution from [medications].
How long normally till resolved? Its been about a month and the [patient
is] only a little better. Resistance is being considered by the doctor
treating the patient.

[WHO's website at http://jupiter.who.ch/yellow/peru.htm has the following
(1997 data):
>Chloroquine-resistant _P. falciparum_ detected in Piura, Loreto and
Luciano Castillo.
There is no mention of resistant vivax. - Mod.JW]
