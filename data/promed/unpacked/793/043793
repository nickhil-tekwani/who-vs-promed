More than 11,000 rubella cases have been reported from the Opole region,
marking the biggest rubella epidemic there in twenty years. Doctors warn
that in the near future the disease is likely to spread to other parts of
Poland. Rubella can prove dangerous to pregnant women as it may cause
serious damage to the fetus.

[Of course, we do not know where "there" is, so we do not know whether this
is a large outbreak for Poland or a large outbreak for the Opole region.
In any event, it is a large and dangerous outbreak. Opole is on the Oder
River, about 300 km southwest of Warsaw and about 50 km from the Czech
Republic border. - Mod.CHC]
