----------------------------------------------------------------
I would suggest that there are only 2 viable solutions to this problem:

[1] Breeding resistant bananas. This can be done, but bananas are difficult to breed because they are triploid. Working in Uganda, we have shown an effective approach to this problem by developing methods to secure both tetraploid and diploid parent populations. When breeding these populations in parallel for performance and resistance to Moko disease, it can take as little as 5 years to start generating novel triploid eating bananas with different resistance profiles.

[2] Using bacteriophages that target the strains of _Ralstonia solanacearum_ causing Moko disease. This approach has been adopted to control bacterial wilt of tomato and potato, and has resulted in the release of a commercial product in the USA. We have also worked on this approach in South Africa and have a number of strains of phages that attack _Ralstonia_.

I suggest that this approach could work in Suriname, if they had the expertise to isolate the phages and the capacity to produce a phage cocktail as a commercial product on an ongoing basis. Alternatively, it could be done on a non-profit basis by an aid agency. However, the challenge is then to produce a quality product in adequate volumes on an ongoing basis, to continue to treat the affected areas for several years.

I hope that people will start to think of bacteriophages as a viable and normal option to control bacterial diseases.

[Our sincere thanks go to Prof. Laing for these valuable comments.

Bacteriophages are viruses which specialise in infecting bacteria. They are species specific and may enter a lytic cycle lethal to the host cell. With the emergence of bacterial resistance to agrochemicals and antibiotics, as well as increasing environmental problems due these compounds, the potential of phages for biocontrol of plant (as well as animal and human) diseases is becoming increasingly more important.

Phage preparations can be used to limit bacterial populations in crops to below an economically significant threshold, as well as to treat soil or water which may spread the pathogens. However, like with other biocontrol organisms, their efficiency may depend on environmental factors and pathogen strains.

Once relevant phages have been identified for use against a specific plant pathogenic bacterium, preparation of bioprotectants requires little technology. The products are safe and relatively cheap compared to equivalent chemical protectants and may therefore be particularly useful in developing countries.
