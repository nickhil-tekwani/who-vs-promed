BSE MODEL - UK
**************
A ProMED-mail post
www.healthnet.org/programs/promed.html
[Some weeks ago Torsten Brinch proposed a model of BSE in the UK on BSE-L.
It had some interesting and thought provoking differences from previous
models. We agreed that when the related discussion on BSE-L had finished,
he would provide ProMED-mail with the resulting redraft, which he has
kindly done. It follows. - Mod.MHJ]

Longitudinal trends in the UK BSE epizootic have drawn considerable
interest with main focus being on indications of the decline of disease
incidence, and future virtual disappearance. The data set most frequently
worked from is the time series of number of cases by month (or year) of
disease onset.
Another option would be to use data on number of confirmed cases by month
of birth, which is known for approximately 2/3 of all confirmed BSE cases.
Little has been published using these data, however. Recently I have used
this data set (graphed data from references (1) and (2)), in an attempt to
obtain some indication of the changing exposure to birth cohorts over time.
The unadjusted data set of cases by month of birth does not show changes in
exposure well, because there is a huge seasonal variation. This variation
can reasonably be assigned to two main factors:
- a distinct annual calving pattern, UK calving season being in the autumn.
- calves born early in the calving season are preferentially chosen for
replacement into the herd.
My seasonal adjustment method is very simple:
- sum all cases born in each calendar month across the years (12 sums),
- calculate the proportion of these sums born in each year,
- plot all proportions as a function of time; -- and this graph emerges:

1) Significant disease-causing exposure is apparent to cows born from the
autumn 1982 and onwards. Exposure increased strongly for cows born during
1986 and the first half of 1987.
2) For cows born during the year preceding the feed ban in July 1988, a
high plateau of exposure to disease causing agent was reached. It is
noteworthy that approximately 1/3 of all confirmed cases were born during
this period.
3) At the time of the feed ban, a dramatic drop is seen. Apparently,
exposure to cows born just a few months after the feed ban has been only
half [that of] the exposure to cows born a few months before the ban and
during the preceding high exposure plateau.)
4) The immediate dramatic drop was not sustained, and exposure continued at
significant levels to cattle born several years after the feed ban.
Two weaknesses to the simple approach to data used to produce the graph
have been identified:
a) Not all cases born in 1989 and onwards have reached the age where
disease sets on, thus data for the latest birth cohorts are incomplete --
this leads to an impression of misleadingly low exposure to cows born
during 1989, 1990, and 1991. (This weakness can be addressed and corrected
using the result from the SMR analysis (Fig.18, (2)) which was produced by
the method described by
Hoinville (3).)
b) It is assumed that the annual calving and replacement selection pattern
has been constant during the period, but it is known that the UK calving
season has been broadened and shifted forward during the period. This
change is not easily corrected for and should lead to spurious secondary
exposure peaks for calves born during June and July in the latest years
(and valleys in the early years). This effect is not very apparent in the
lo-res graph above, but is seen in the high resolution graphs which can be
viewed at the webpage <http://inet.uni2.dk/~iaotb/exposur4.htm> to which I
refer the interested reader.
Finally I would add that I find that the results of my method are not fully
consistent with some of the assumptions of the Anderson et al (4) analysis
of the longitudinal trends of BSE, mainly:
- the assumption of a strong seasonal variation of -feed risk- (I think
that the seasonal variation can be more simply explained by the annual
pattern of calving and replacement selection.)
- the assumption of feed risk peaking -after the feed ban- (I think that
the feed risk peaked before or at the time of the feed ban)
- the estimated/assumed mean age at infection being 1.3 years (I think that
the mean age of disease causing exposure must have been lower, and that it
might well be as early as the weaning period)
