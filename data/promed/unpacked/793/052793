[A puzzler. If the last case on this farm was in 1987, that there might be a persistent contaminated grave is not impossible but there would have been outbreaks in the intervening years. It is more likely that there might have been an outbreak in a nearby Bulgarian herd and a tabanid fly with contaminated mouthparts made its way to this flock. Of course the possibility of an unreported outbreak in a neighbor's herd might have been the source but this just pushes the source just one step further back. And then there is the question that there has been an active vaccination program and that this known affected flock still came down. Hopefully further investigations on the ground may reveal why this outbreak occurred. - Mod.MHJ
