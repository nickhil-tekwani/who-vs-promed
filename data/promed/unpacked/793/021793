The Mississippi State Department of Health [MSDH] confirmed its 1st human case of West Nile virus in the state this year [2022]. The case is in a person in Hinds County.

The virus is mosquito-borne and causes flu-like symptoms in humans. Occasionally the illness can be severe and lead to meningitis or encephalitis.

MSDH says West Nile virus peaks from July to October, but mosquitoes can carry the virus all year. The department has some tips to avoid becoming infected:

- Use a recommended mosquito repellent.
- Cover arms and legs with long sleeves and long skirts or pants.
- Avoid mosquito-prone areas in the mornings and evenings, when mosquitoes are most active.
- Remove sources of standing water around your home where mosquitoes can breed, and make sure window screens are in good condition.

There hasn't been a West Nile death in Mississippi since 2017 [but there have been non-fatal human cases as recently as last year (2021); see the comment below].

[West Nile virus (WNV) is endemic in the lower 48 states of the USA, including Mississippi. Last year (2021), 7 human WNV infections occurred in the state. Of these, 4 were neuroinvasive and 3 were non-neuroinvasive (see https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/statsmaps/preliminarymapsdata2021/disease-cases-state-2021.html). Occurrence of human cases of WNV in the state is not surprising, but this case is very early in the usual transmission season. The WNV transmission season in the southern states in the USA usually occurs in the summer months, but cases can occur at any time as noted in the above report.

Since its introduction into the USA in 1999, annual case numbers in given states have been variable. Vector control and public education to avoid mosquito bites are the best measures to prevent human cases. Equine animals can be vaccinated, but there is no commercially available vaccine for human use. - Mod.TY
