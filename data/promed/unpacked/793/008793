Despite its optimism to be rabies free by 2015, Bali has been challenged this week by another rabies case. On Tue [16 Jul 2013], a rabid dog bit 5 people in Gianyar regency. The people who were bitten have received medical treatment and rabies vaccinations.

"The remains of the dog that bit 5 residents in Gianyar have been examined by the Denpasar Veterinary Board. They concluded that the dog was infected with rabies," the provincial husbandry agency head, I Putu Sumantra, said on Wednesday [17 Jul 2013].

The incident occurred in Kutuh Kelod hamlet, Petulu village, in Gianyar regency. One of the victims, 46, was heading off to Ubud art market at 10 a.m. when the dog bit her on her right foot. After the attacks, the villagers caught and killed the dog.

To prevent the victims themselves developing rabies, the 5 were vaccinated. The reappearance of rabies serves as a new challenge for the island, which is targeting being free of rabies by 2015. In April this year [2013], the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) presented awards to Bali's provincial administration for its successful efforts in preventing and mitigating rabies.

Sumantra suspected that the dog had come from the forests in the mountains around Gianyar, where the vaccination had not yet reached. He said it was possible that there were more dogs living in the forests that were still unvaccinated. "It is our challenge now to vaccinate dogs living in the forests. There could be more dogs living out there," he added.

The 1st rabies outbreak in Bali occurred in 2008 in Ungasan village. Since then, Bali has gone through 3 stages of mass vaccinations for dogs, monkeys and cats, all of which are believed to be rabies carriers. This year [2013], from April to July 2013, the 4th stage of the mass vaccination is taking place, targeting inoculating 250 000 of the 350 000 dog population.

Rabies cases in humans in Bali have been decreasing in recent years, thanks to the mass animal vaccination initiative. In 2008, 4 cases were recorded, while 2009 saw 48 cases. The largest number, 82 cases, was recorded in 2010. After the mass animal vaccination program was launched in Bali, rabies cases in humans started to decrease. In 2011, 24 cases were recorded, and by 2012, only 8 cases had occurred.

Vaccinations for humans are performed in 33 rabies centers housed in community health centers, Sanglah Hospital, and 9 regional hospitals free of charge.

[The rabies situation in Bali has been concisely described in a recent review (Ref. 1), copied for subscribers' convenience:

"In November 2008, rabies was 1st detected within the southernmost peninsula of Bali and then spread throughout the province by June 2010. About 137 humans have died of rabies in Bali since it was 1st introduced in 2008, but the number could be higher than this (over 160 human cases; ProMED-mail, 2011b). The outbreak was initially responded to with mass killing of dogs (about 108 000 dogs were killed between 2008 and October 2010). Later, an island-wide mass dog vaccination campaign was commenced in October 2010 and completed in March 2011 (phase 1) under close coordination of the Bali provincial government together with the Bali Animal Welfare Association (BAWA), the Bali Street Dog Fund Australia and the World Society for the Protection of Animals (WSPA). During phase I, approximately 210 000 dogs have been vaccinated (70 percent of the Bali dog population (350 000 dogs; ProMED-mail, 2011c). Mass dog vaccination was initially implemented with 6 teams of 50 personnel each to catch and vaccinate dogs, and later expanded to 52 teams with 420 trained personnel. There was a 48 percent reduction of human rabies cases in Bali in the 1st 3 month of 2011 (ProMED-mail, 2011c). Rabid dog cases have also declined with a report of about 11 cases per month during and after the campaign compared with about 45 cases per month before the campaign. Similarly, the number of infected villages declined, from 19.4 percent (140/723 villages) to 6.6 percent (48/723). The 2nd phase of the island-wide campaign started in May 2011 and was completed in October 2011. Bali plans to eliminate rabies by 2015."

Hopefully, the Bali authorities, assisted by the mentioned NGO's, will manage to overcome the current challenge on its road to elimination of rabies on the island. - Mod.AS
