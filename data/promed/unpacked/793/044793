A new journal article from researchers at the CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the Bacterial Special Pathogens Branch describes cases of welder's anthrax, a newly identified, deadly occupational disease (https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0817/11/4/402).

Welder's anthrax is defined as pneumonia in a metalworker caused by bacteria within the _B. cereus_ group that produces anthrax toxin. Seven patients diagnosed with what is now termed welder's anthrax were reported to the CDC from 1994-2020. The job title of 6 patients was welder, and the job title of the 7th was metalworker. All were confirmed to be infected with _B. cereus_ group bacteria containing anthrax toxin genes. Six of the workers were men. The median age was 39 years. Four of the patients worked in Texas and 3 in Louisiana.

Information on the type of welding, job activities, and type of workplace, including indoor or outdoor activities, was limited for most of the patients except for the 2 patients diagnosed in 2020. One patient worked on the roof of an oil tank outdoors. He welded on new A36 mild carbon steel using a shielded metal arc welding (or stick) process. The other patient worked in a wood fabrication shop. He welded on low-carbon mild steel using Metal Inert Gas (MIG) with solid or flux core wire and 75% argon/25% carbon dioxide shield gas. Both patients performed additional tasks such as scrubbing debris with a wire metal brush and grinding. Both reportedly wore respiratory protection during welding activities.

Of the 6 patients with available data on signs and symptoms, over half presented with each of the following: fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath (dyspnea), and coughing up blood (hemoptysis). All had abnormal chest radiographs and were diagnosed with pneumonia. All were hospitalized and were admitted to the intensive care unit if they survived past the emergency department. Five of the 7 patients died. All patients received broad-spectrum antibacterial treatment. One of the surviving patients received raxibacumab, a monoclonal anthrax antitoxin.

Several studies have shown an increased risk of pneumonia and death among welders and other workers exposed to metal fumes and mineral dusts (1-6). Research suggests it is possible that exposure to metal fumes might increase susceptibility to lung infection, even with common, relatively harmless infectious agents (7). Furthermore, iron oxide deposited in the lungs after inhaling welding fume has been found in the lungs for years, even after removal from exposure (8).

How metal fumes cause disease is mostly unknown. Theories include that metal fumes (or iron) act as a growth nutrient for bacteria, enhance the binding of bacteria to lung tissues, or impair immune responses in the lung through oxidative stress (1,5,6,9). Like all pathogens, _B. anthracis_ and _B. cereus_ anthrax toxins need iron to survive and thrive. While iron overload might partially explain the increased susceptibility of welders for _B. cereus_ infections, exposure is still important. Several researchers have noted that soil iron is much higher around welding sites than elsewhere (10,11). Future research measuring soil iron levels may provide useful information.

The hierarchy of controls can be used to prevent workplace exposure to welding fumes and gases, and soils that may be contaminated with _B. cereus_ group bacteria producing anthrax toxins.

- Employers should conduct a hazard assessment on all welders, other metalworkers, and supervisors at worksites.
- Elimination and substitution controls to help reduce exposure to fume and gases from welding and soils that may be contaminated with cereus group include:
*Using a less toxic welding type or consumable.
*Ensuring that welding surfaces are free of any coatings, dirt, and dust that may lead to potentially toxic exposures.
- Engineering controls can include the use of general and local exhaust ventilation. Do not assume that welding outdoors or in open areas provides adequate general ventilation, even when the welder uses proper positioning and natural drafts. Local exhaust systems should be positioned to draw fume and gases away from the welder and other workers in the area.
- Administrative controls include maintaining a clean and dirt-free worksite.
*Workplaces should be routinely cleaned with a vacuum equipped with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter or wet cleaning methods.
*Compressed air and dry sweeping or brushing should not be used.
*Dust control programs in outdoor workplaces and near workplaces open to the outdoors can minimize dirt and dust exposure, and activities in the immediate vicinity should be limited to help minimize disturbing dry dust.
*In surrounding areas, adding water, hydroscopic compounds, or surfactants to roadways and surfaces that are heavily traveled can help control dirt and dust exposures. However, these substances should not be applied in the immediate area where welding occurs, as this may cause an electrocution hazard.
- Welders and other metalworkers must understand their potential occupational health risks and how to protect themselves. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Hazard Communication Standard requires employers to inform and train workers on potential work hazards and associated safe practices, procedures, and protective measures.
- Personal protective equipment (PPE) may include coveralls and work boots in the workplace to prevent their skin and clothing from being contaminated and taking contaminants home. NIOSH-approved respirators, as part of a written respiratory protection program, may be needed when other controls do not reduce exposures to safe levels.

Physicians should consider welder's anthrax in welders who present with pneumonia, particularly those working in American Gulf Coast states. Welders and other metalworkers who present with welder's anthrax should be treated the same as a patient with inhalation anthrax.

If infection with anthrax toxin-expressing _B. cereus_ group is suspected, it is important to notify the state health department; a consultation with CDC is recommended. Anthrax antitoxins should be considered as adjunctive therapy if the patient's clinical condition suggests systemic illness. However, the role of anthrax vaccine pre- or post-exposure for welders is not currently recognized or understood.

It is possible that cases of welder's anthrax were missed due to limited detection and understanding of anthrax toxins, underdiagnosis, and under-reporting of the patient's occupation. To improve data collection in surveillance systems, the NIOSH Surveillance Program recommends that occupational questions should be standardized, and information on both industry and occupation should be collected and analyzed. Other helpful information for the investigation of welder's anthrax includes the employer's name, work location, job duties, and questions about specific types of welding, metals, and other exposures and protective measures taken.

Communication and cooperation between clinicians, employers, and public health practitioners is important to identify cases of welder's anthrax and occupational and personal risk factors. More research is needed to better understand the mechanisms of infection and disease among welders. Additional research is needed to better understand how exposure to metal fumes and other welding hazards may increase susceptibility to and severity of lung infection in welders. The effectiveness of interventions to minimize workers' exposure to metal fumes, including engineering controls and respiratory protection, should also be explored.

Welder's anthrax is a new and rare disease. We would like to raise awareness of this infection among welders and clinicians. If you have ideas for how to do so, please contact us through the comment section below [see source URL].

["Raxibacumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that is directed at the protective antigen (PA) moiety of the anthrax toxin (from _Bacillus anthracis_) and that prevents the toxin from entering cells. It is indicated for the treatment of inhalation anthrax, in combination with appropriate antimicrobials. It is also indicated for anthrax prophylaxis if alternatives are not feasible. It is administered as a single intravenous dose. Its approval in 2012 was based on its low toxicity profile in over 500 normal (adult) volunteers, and therapeutic efficacy in monkey and rabbit models of anthrax" (https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/raxibacumab).

ProMED has previously posted about such cases. In 2017, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (see post Bacillus cereus, anthrax-like infection: identification advice 20171003.535848) noted such strains in Africa: "An unknown strain of _Bacillus cereus_ causing anthrax-like disease was first isolated in a dead chimpanzee in Cote d'Ivoire in 2001 and again in 2002. Following in 2004 and 2006, researchers isolated samples from another chimpanzee and a western lowland gorilla further east in Cameroon. Although anthrax is caused by _Bacillus anthracis_, tests showed the isolated strain was a form of _B. cereus_ carrying plasmids that were identical to the virulence plasmids found in _B. anthracis_. The new strain was named _B. cereus_ biovar (bv) anthracis."

The 2004 PNAS report (1) described _B. cereus_ G9241, one of several past isolates of the organism, causing unusually severe lung disease and which was very similar to _B. anthracis_. G9241 had been isolated from a Louisiana welder in 1994. In 1996, 2 additional cases in Texas metalworkers were reported as well as an environmental isolate (2). One of the isolates was clinically indistinguishable from the Louisiana case. The clinical isolates possessed a capsule, but it was not the anthrax poly-D-glutamic acid capsule. The Texas cases were described in clinical form in 2007 (3). Further evaluation of the G9241 strain, interestingly, found that despite producing its virulence factors, the strain behaved more like the attenuated toxigenic nonencapsulated Sterne strain in rabbits and mice (4).

With these cases seemingly localized to Texas and Louisiana in the USA, an additional isolate was, as noted above, found from a cluster of anthrax-like deaths that occurred in Cote d'Ivoire among wild chimpanzees in 2001 and 2002 (5). This strain had the typical _B. cereus_ chromosomal background with the typical anthrax virulence plasmids. Importantly, the isolate did not contain the 4 _B. anthracis_-specific prophage regions and also did not have the classical nonsense mutation in the regulator gene P1cR. The highly monophyletic anthrax clade all contain these features (6).

These isolates seem, once again, to nominate Mother Nature as our world's best bioterrorist. Microbiologists and clinicians should be aware of these strains, especially in the population described in the posting.

The table in this paper has a footnote reporting "Recent taxonomic updates have subdivided the _B. cereus_ group into an additional 9 species (https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem/10.1099/ijsem.0.001821). Whole genome sequence analysis suggests these isolates would be classified as newly described _Bacillus tropicus_."
