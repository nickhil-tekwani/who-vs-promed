Hospital in Gorakhpur. Also, 7 new cases have been admitted to BRD

[Again, these reports indicate that additional cases of encephalitis
are occurring, but without specifying the etiology. Previous reports
have identified Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) as one of the agents
involved, but the acute encephalitic syndrome several of the previous
reports mention remains of unspecified etiology, but perhaps due to
Nipah virus or enteroviruses.
