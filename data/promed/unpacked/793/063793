Congo: 8 dead in Pointe-Noire in an epidemic related to poliomyelitis
---------------------------------------------------------------------
An epidemic similar to poliomyelitis has been
raging in Pointe-Noire, the principal economic
and industrial center of the Congo, for nearly 2
weeks. There are already 8 deaths and 20 cases
reported, the Congolese Ministry of Health announced on Tuesday [2 Nov 2010].

"Patients have been admitted to hospitals with
symptoms of an influenza-like illness. They also
have paralysis starting with the legs and
[ascending] to the upper extremities." said the
Director General [DG] of Health, Professor Alexis Elira Dockekias.

"This epidemic is very similar to poliomyelitis
which has raged [in the past] with the difference
that this time the disease is affecting teenagers
and adults, unlike polio, which mainly affects
young children," said Professor Elira Dockekias.

According to the DG of Health, the disease is
probably caused by a virus that invades the digestive tract.

The Congolese Ministry of Health has already
notified the World Health Organization (WHO), in
accordance with the provisions concerning
international health epidemics [this probably
refers to the International Health Regulations (IHR)].

However, Professor Elira Dockekias urged the
public not to panic but to observe basic hygiene
measures in consuming only potable water.

"Water must be boiled before consumption; one can
also use the products recommended by health
services to citizens," said the DG of Health.

Due to the lack of potable water in some
districts of Pointe-Noire, especially in the
periphery [outside of the center of town], people
can consume water from wells and some poorly
maintained boreholes that, during the rainy
season, serve as homes for multiplication of many
parasites, bacteria and viruses that cause epidemics.

[The brief description of the disease sounds like
an ascending paralysis that is often seen with
Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) -- an autoimmune
disease with an inflammatory demyelination of
peripheral nerves. GBS often follows a
respiratory or gastrointestinal illness (notably
following campylobacteriosis -- see ref. 2
below). The illness presents with a subacute
onset of progressive and symmetrical weakness in
the legs and arms, with loss of reflexes. Sensory
abnormalities are seen as well as involvement of
cranial nerves, and paralysis of respiratory
muscles also can occur. In areas with good
supportive care, there is low case fatality rate.

Some notable distinctions between GBS and polio
include the observation that 90 percent of those
with paralytic disease related to poliovirus
infection have residual paralysis, whereas
approximately 90 percent of those with GBS have
complete recovery from their paralysis. Another
distinction is that the neurologic disease seen
with poliovirus infection involves pure motor
deficit with sensory sparing, whereas GBS
typically has significant sensory deficits along with the motor impairment.

GBS has also been associated with organophosphate poisoning (see ref. 1 below).

The newswire does not give further details on the
clinical picture to know if the paralysis is
flaccid or spastic, the latter having been
associated with a disease known as konzo, related
to cyanide toxicity from cassava (see ref.4 below).

There have been cases of paralytic disease
similar to that seen with poliomyelitis
associated with infection with enterovirus 71
(see ref. 6), and a report of a polio like
paralysis with Echovirus 7 infection (see ref. 5).

As Pointe-Noire is a coastal city, the
possibility of exposure to a neurotoxin in
seafood such as seen in paralytic shellfish
poisoning or tetrodotoxin is also there,
especially with the description of the outbreak
as "raging", suggesting an acute process.

That being said, the most common etiology of an
outbreak of a poliomyelitis-like illness is
infection with wild poliovirus (WPV). The
observation that the majority of cases are in
teenagers and adults may well represent the
accumulation of pockets of susceptibles at older
ages following the interruption of WPV
transmission in the area due to intensive
National Immunization Days through the years of
the polio eradication efforts. The last reported
cases of WPV associated polio reported in the
Congo were in 2000 (WPV1 date of onset 29 Sep
2000 and WPV3 date of onset 28 Nov 2000 -- see
<http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek/Wildpolioviruslist.aspx>).

What is unusual here is the reported CFR of
approximately either 28.6 percent or 40 percent
(the article is unclear if the 8 deaths were
included in the count of 20 cases or if they were
in addition to the 20 cases mentioned)... -- very high for both polio and GBS.

On checking the ProMED-mail archives, in 2006
there was a report of 7 fatalities and an
additional 24 individuals hospitalized in
Maranhao Brazil with an undiagnosed paralytic
illness (see Undiagnosed neurologic syndrome,
deaths - Brazil (Maranhao): RFI
20060622.1727). (This was the heralding event
for an investigation that identified a large
outbreak of beriberi -- thiamine deficiency -- in
the state of Maranhao, related to
citreoviridin-producing _Penicillum citreonigrun_
grow in the rice stored in the affected region -- see ref 7 below)

Clearly more information from knowledgeable
sources on the clinical presentation of cases,
incubation period, along with information from
laboratory studies would be very much appreciated.
