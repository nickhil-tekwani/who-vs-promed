Ethiopia reports measles and diphtheria outbreaks
-------------------------------------------------
The country of the Horn of Africa is currently battling outbreaks in 2 vaccine-preventable diseases, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). To date, 2190 suspected measles cases were reported in 61 separate outbreaks in Ethiopia, of which 929 cases were confirmed positive. The majority of the cases were from Nejo and Nole woredas of West Wellega zone (Oromia) and Kola Tembien woreda of Central Tigray zone (Tigray). 28 per cent of cases were children under-5 and 33 per cent of those affected were above 15 years of age.

Measles is a highly contagious viral disease. It is widespread in many parts of the world, including Europe, Africa, and Asia. Measles begins with a fever that lasts for a couple of days, followed by a cough, runny nose, conjunctivitis (pink eye), and a rash. The rash typically appears 1st on the face, along the hairline, and behind the ears and then affects the rest of the body. Infected people are usually contagious from about 4 days before their rash starts to 4 days afterwards. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends 2 doses of the MMR vaccine for prevention: the 1st at 12 months of age, and the 2nd between ages 4-6.

Complications from measles are more common in children younger than 5 years old and adults 20 years and older. Complications can include diarrhea, ear infection and pneumonia. Death can occur from severe complications and the risk is higher among younger children and adults. There is no treatment for measles. Bed rest, fluids and fever control are recommended. People with complications may need treatment for their specific problem.

In addition to measles, an outbreak of diphtheria was reported in Alle and Konso woredas (SNNPR) on 25 Feb 2015. As of 7 Mar 2015, there were 31 suspected cases and 6 deaths. Investigations to determine the extent of the outbreak are on-going. Diphtheria can be treated and cured successfully with antitoxin and antibiotics if started early enough. The prevention of diphtheria is through vaccination.

Sudan: UNICEF launches measles vaccination campaign after outbreak
------------------------------------------------------------------
The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) will launch a wide measles agency said in a statement on Thursday [2 Apr 2015]. UNICEF has confirmed in the statement that it has ordered 9.6 million doses of measles vaccines to support the Sudanese Ministry of Health in combating the current measles outbreak in the country.

The UN Children's Rights and Emergency Relief Organization will conduct a mass immunization campaign, in cooperation with the Health Ministry targeting 7.9 million children from 9 months to 15 years in 26 affected and 70 high-risk localities. According to UNICEF, the 1st batch of more than 2 million doses arrived at Khartoum National Airport on Tuesday [31 Mar 2015].

During the past 3 months, measles has spread across 29 localities in 16 of Sudan's 18 states. By 26 Mar 2015, confirmed measles cases numbered 1120. The most affected state is Kassala (353 cases, 2 deaths) followed by Red Sea (205 cases and 3 deaths), and North Darfur (140 cases, 12 deaths), according to UNICEF.

Measles travel notices issued for Angola, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Ethiopia
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued 3 travel notices Wednesday due to ongoing measles outbreaks in Angola, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Ethiopia. In Angola, the US federal health agency says the country is experiencing an ongoing measles outbreak. The number of confirmed measles cases increased from 6558 in 2013 to 12 036 in 2014; and cases continue to occur in 2015.

In Europe, as of February 2015, the Federal Institute of Public Health in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina has reported more than 3800 cases since January 2014. Most of the cases have been in 3 Central Bosnia Canton municipalities: Bugojno, Fojnica, and Travnik.

Finally, on the Horn of Africa, Ethiopia is experiencing an ongoing measles outbreak. The number of confirmed measles cases increased from 6100 in 2013 to more than 14 000 confirmed cases in 2014; cases continue to occur in 2015.

The CDC recommends that travelers to all 3 destinations protect themselves by making sure they are vaccinated against measles, particularly infants 6-11 months of age (1 dose of measles vaccine) and children 12 months of age or older (2 doses of measles vaccine). Clinicians should keep measles in mind when treating patients with fever and rash, especially if the patient has recently traveled internationally.

Almost 1000 cases of measles reported in Berlin
-----------------------------------------------
Since the start of an outbreak of measles in the German capital in October [2014], there have been almost 1000 cases of the highly contagious disease, Berlin's health authorities reported this week [week ending 4 Apr 2015]. Of the 970 cases reported by Thursday [2 Apr 2015], 849 have been reported since January [2015], the Berlin State Office for Health and Social Affair said.

Around a quarter of cases are so severe they need to be treated in hospital. Measles attacks the immune system and can lead to serious infections of the lungs or brain. The outbreak, one of the worst in Germany in a decade, does not appear to be slowing, the authorities said.

The reasons behind the severity of the Berlin outbreak is a lack of knowledge in the population and too many young people who were not vaccinated against the disease over unfounded fears about the side effects of the vaccine.

Berlin Health Senator Mario Czaja urged parents and children who were not vaccinated to go to the doctor and get immunized against the disease.

Four confirmed cases of measles in Metro Vancouver
--------------------------------------------------
Two new cases of measles have been confirmed in Metro Vancouver [British Columbia province] by public health authorities. The total number of recent infections in the region now stands at 4 cases.

According to the Vancouver Coastal Health Authority, a student of the Christian school Carver Christian High School in Burnaby is a new case. He was aboard a flight of Air China that landed in Vancouver on 21 Mar 2015, with 2 other passengers who were suffering from the disease.

Governance of Fraser Health organized a vaccination clinic Thursday [2 Apr 2015] at Carver Christian High School. According to Dr. Michelle Murti of governance, the incubation period for measles can extend up to 3 weeks, which means that there could be other cases that have not yet been diagnosed.

"People can have a little fever, cough and runny nose, and it's only a few days later that the typical measles rash appears," she says.

The Public Health Agency of Canada points out that anyone who is not immunized against measles can contract the disease, and that children are particularly vulnerable.

Florida confirms measles case
-----------------------------
The Florida Department of Health recently confirmed that an international traveler who visited the state had the measles. The traveler attended an international conference on 16 and 17 Mar 2015 at the Gaylord Palms Resort and Convention Center in Kissimmee, Florida. The individual's travel history included several counties in central and south Florida, including Osceola, Orange, Miami-Dade and Sarasota counties between 14 and 20 Mar 2015. The traveler did not spend any time at amusement parks. He was hospitalized for his illness from 20 to 24 Mar 2015, and flew out of Florida on 25 Mar 2015.

All of the people who attended the international conference have been notified of the situation. Symptoms of measles include a fever; cough; blotchy rash; feeling run down or achy; and having a runny nose, red, watery eyes, and tiny white spots with bluish-white centers inside the mouth. Symptoms appear 7 to 14 days after exposure.

Health professionals in Florida and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention encourage the general public to receive the Measles Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccine to prevent contracting the disease. This vaccine requires multiple doses; one dose is not enough to guarantee protection from the virus.

Measles outbreak raises concerns, awareness
-------------------------------------------
This past January [2015], national news outlets spread word of a measles outbreak that began at Disneyland in California. This breaking story was shocking to many, as measles had previously been declared eliminated in the U.S. in the year 2000.

"The measles outbreak raises concerns about vaccination rates across the country and how both children and adults should best protect themselves from getting measles," said Vail Valley Medical Center's [in Colorado] President and CEO Doris Kirchner. "Our experts agree vaccinations are critical to community health."

The measles outbreak at Disneyland is part of a significant rise in the number of measles cases occurring in the U.S. every year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention attributes this increase to more measles cases reported in foreign countries that Americans typically travel to, and small sectors around the country where unvaccinated people have spread measles to others who are also unvaccinated.

The CDC recommends children receive 2 doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, 1st between 12 and 15 months and again between ages 4 and 6. The 1st dose is 93 percent effective, and the 2 doses together are 97 percent effective. If parents are traveling with infants younger than 12 months, it's recommended to get the 1st dose early in order to protect the child.

Jason Moore, epidemiologist at Vail Valley Medical Center, said for adults, if you received at least one dose of the vaccine, you are still protected. If you're unsure if you received the MMR immunization or can't locate your childhood vaccination records, there's no harm in getting the vaccine again.

One of the most common serious complications from measles is pneumonia -- one of the leading causes of death for children younger than 5 worldwide. Moore said one out of every 1000 children with measles will die of the infection. In addition, one of the most feared complications from the measles virus is permanent neurological complications, which sometimes occur.

The initial symptoms of measles include a high fever, cough, runny nose and red, watery eyes. 3 to 5 days later, a rash with flat red spots appears on the face. "People are contagious about 4 days before to 4 days after the rash," Moore said. "Usually the rash appears 2 weeks after they're exposed. They're starting to feel crummy a few days before the rash, but there's nothing hard and fast (indicating measles until) the rash comes." The initial symptoms of measles are difficult to distinguish among other viruses, like the common cold. Moore said before a rash appears, if symptoms progress and your child (or you) is getting worse, see a doctor who can determine whether or not there's a risk.

So far this year [2015] there has been only one reported case of measles in the state of Colorado (in El Paso County), as a result of the outbreak at Disneyland. However, according to 2013-14 school records data, only 82 percent of kindergartners in Colorado are fully vaccinated against measles -- much lower than the national average of 95 percent. One reason for this is the state's higher exemption rate, as certain laws allow parents to oppose vaccinations for their child on the grounds of personal or religious beliefs.

Locally, Eagle County Public Health offers immunizations by appointment in Avon, Eagle and El Jebel. Colorado Mountain Medical makes the vaccination available in their Vail, Edwards and Eagle locations. The Vaccines for Children Program provides immunizations for children younger than age 18, and no child is denied access to a vaccine due to inability to pay.

Unfortunate as the measles outbreak at Disneyland is, it has raised more awareness about vaccines and the serious health risks associated with childhood diseases. It's easy to forget the time when children getting seriously ill or dying from viruses like measles was a common occurrence. The important thing is many of these childhood diseases are now preventable due to immunizations. "Get vaccinated. That's the best thing," Moore said. "I'm hoping increasing public education will help combat the issue."

Moore considers vaccinations to be one of the greatest public health initiatives in the history of medicine, and if even one child dies from a virus that a vaccine is readily available for, that's one too many.

[9] USA: lessons to be learned
Date: Wed 1 Apr 2015

5 Crucial Lessons From The Recent Measles Outbreak
--------------------------------------------------
While the United States is overwhelmingly vaccinated against preventable viruses like measles, mumps and rubella (on account of them coming altogether in one shot), there are certain pockets around the country where vaccination rates are dipping below the 95 percent needed to maintain herd immunity. These under-vaccinated communities, coupled with travelers bringing the measles over from other countries, have resulted in an unusual amount of measles cases -- 644 cases over 23 outbreaks in 2014, and in 2015 to date, 178 cases over 4 outbreaks. These numbers represent the greatest levels of measles that America has ever seen since measles was 1st eradicated from the country, in 2000.

The size and scope of the biggest outbreak this year, which links 131 cases to exposure at the Disneyland theme park last December [2014], has focused the nation's attention like a laser to the tiny communities scattered around the U.S. that have chosen to skip vaccinating their children, without medical justification. In the story below, 3 infectious disease experts weigh in on what America has learned by turning an ear toward these communities and keeping a wary eye on the growing number of infections.

1. The measles vaccine may be a victim of its own success.

Dr. Walter Orenstein, Associate Director of the Emory Vaccine Center, says a lack of memory about the scourge of measles may be contributing to rising non-vaccination rates in certain pockets of the country. Americans used to be really scared of the measles -- until one day, we weren't. To illustrate the point, Orenstein related a personal story about the polio vaccine, which he received in 1955, about how insistent his mother was on protecting him from the paralyzing disease.

"I tell a joke; I was in 2nd grade when the Salk polio vaccine was licensed," said Orenstein over the phone. "I was none too happy to get a shot for something I knew nothing about, but my mother said, 'Better you should cry than I should cry.'"

"There were fears about these diseases that aren't here today, in part because vaccines have been victims of their own success," he continued. "If people aren't aware of it, they can let down their guard."

Because measles is so contagious, the virus used to be a near-universal and serious disease in the United States. From 1912 to 1916, there were an average of 5300 measles deaths per year. And while deaths began going down thanks to better nutrition and improved medical support, in the late 1950s, complications from the disease left an average of 150 000 people with respiratory problems and 4000 with encephalitis (brain swelling). A 1962 study also found that more than 90 percent of Americans had contracted measles before the age of 15.

That all changed in 1968, when doctors began to distribute the measles vaccine as we know it today. Almost immediately, the measles rate plunged, and then plunged again when public health officials began recommending a 2nd shot of the vaccine. The successful vaccine eventually helped eradicate measles transmission in the U.S. by 2000.

Now the memories of painful measles rashes and potentially deadly complications from the virus are long gone from the public conscious -- and that may be a bad thing. Parents are robbed of an urgency to vaccinate as soon as possible, and doctors have gone so long without treating the disease that they seem to be missing diagnoses, which is what seemed to be the case when members of an Arizona family visited 3 separate healthcare facilities before anyone diagnosed them with measles.

2. The U.S. needs to help other countries strengthen their immunization programs.

Despite the fact that measles is a completely preventable disease, the virus still infects about 20 million people and kills an estimated 146 000 around the world. Some of the infected make their way to the U.S., where they can encounter pockets of under immunized communities (as they did with the Amish in 2014, or Disneyland visitors in 2014 to 2015). It's the perfect powder keg for a measles outbreak, and one way to prevent that from happening is to mount a worldwide immunization campaign to eliminate the virus from the world. Indeed, by February of this year [2015], the U.S. had already experienced measles importations from Indonesia, Azerbaijan, Qatar, India and Dubai, according to Dr. Anne Schuchat, Assistant Surgeon General and the director for the CDC's Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.

For FY2015, the U.S. Agency for International Development has given USD 200 million to Gavi, an international vaccine alliance that has immunization programs in countries like Yemen and Haiti -- up from USD 75 million in FY 2009. U.S.A.I.D. has also pledged a total of USD 1 billion from 2015 to 2018, which is estimated to help vaccinate an additional 300 million children and save at least 5 million lives. This funding is key to the U.S.'s continued relative safety from measles, even as non-vaccination may rise in some American communities, explains Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) at the University of Minnesota.

"International programs are so important; it's not just the direct benefits to those countries around the world, but it's an indirect benefit to us," said Osterholm to HuffPost. "There's a vaccine protection halo that we benefit from when we protect those in other countries."

But much more still needs to be done, and failed and fragile states are particularly vulnerable to viral outbreaks. For instance, because of the havoc that the Ebola outbreak wreaked on countries in West Africa, public health officials fear that millions of children are now vulnerable to measles because they're behind schedule on their vaccinations.

"We have so many situations today where underlying governance issues are so significant that it makes it a challenge to deliver any kind of childhood immunization program," said Osterholm. "Depending on how you define it, we may have as many as33 to 36 failed states in this world today, where its very difficult to deliver health care services, including vaccinations."

3. We're failing to explain basic scientific concepts in school.

Measles vaccines may be understandably low on the list of priorities for parents in war-torn or fragile states, and in the U.S., under-vaccination used to be a problem concentrated in low-income, poorly educated parents with little access to transportation or services. But one of the stranger paradoxes behind low vaccination rates in some pockets of the U.S. in 2015 is that wealthy, well-educated parents seem to be behind the non-vaccination "movement." Why would these parents take such an anti-science perspective, especially if they're affluent and college-educated or better?

Because we're failing to teach basic scientific concepts in schools, says Orenstein.

"It's a failure of our educational system," said Orenstein. "I call [unvaccinated children] children of more highly-schooled, but not highly-educated parents." This distinction manifests itself in the rational -- yet incorrect -- belief in the causal link between vaccines and autism diagnoses, or the observation that if Unusual Event B happens after Unusual Event A, then A must have caused B. But a single case, or even multiple cases of B coming after A, do not prove a causal link. What's needed instead, explained Orenstein, is an epidemiological study (a population-based study) to determine if autism rates are higher in vaccinated children vs. unvaccinated children. And epidemiological studies have proven, time and again, that vaccinations do not cause autism.

4. We still don't understand why people don't vaccinate themselves and their children.

Scientific evidence in support of vaccines is one thing, but we still don't understand what motivates a parent in a developed country to forgo vaccines for their children. While it's easy to ridicule or shame them before dismissing them as a lost cause, key to defeating measles for good will be for researchers to humble themselves and admit they don't know the slightest thing about what motivates these parents, said Osterholm.

"We have a lot of work to do to figure out really what it is that we know and don't know, and be humble enough to accept that we don't know," said Osterholm. "What motivated people not to get vaccinated, and who are they?" This is a major issue both for the U.S. and some countries in Europe, where anti-vaccination movements are even more, ahem, virulent.

Once we understand the whys, said Orenstein, we could develop stronger programs and tactics to help acknowledge parental concerns while presenting facts to counter the myths. Currently, research on how to change a parent's mind to accept vaccines is scary and sobering; there's evidence that tackling the issue from a number of different angles made anti-vaccination parents even more stubborn about their beliefs, according to a 2014 study of 1800 parents. It's studies like these that make Osterholm suspect that strict state policies mandating vaccination may actually backfire.

"There's actually been some recent data showing that the more comprehensive and potentially punitive your efforts are to get people vaccinated, the more people actually reject and fight it, and do whatever they can to get around it," said Osterholm. "We have to understand that better, because in the end we want to see more people up to date on their vaccinations" -- not just pass new, ineffectual laws.

On the other hand, policy experts have found that the harder a state makes the process of seeking a non-medical exemption to vaccines, the fewer parents pursue that option, reports Mother Jones.

5. Other people (besides non-vaccinators) are claiming medical rights, too.

The United States has always been a country to glorify individual rights, even at the expense of the public good (see: gun laws, or lack thereof). But one good thing that has come out over the debate about mandatory vaccination policies is that other groups of people are beginning to talk about their right to health, just as some non-vaccinating parents hold fast to their right to medical choice.

"The really important conversation started in the U.S. because of this outbreak is that the conversation around vaccination has shifted from personal rights to the consideration of additional rights," said Dr. Stephen Parodi, an infectious disease physician and associate executive director for the Permanente Medical Group. For instance, while some may claim the right to choose vaccines (or not), others, like the immunocompromised, who can't get vaccines for medical reasons, and parents of infants who are too young to get vaccinated, are speaking out about their right to herd immunity and protection from preventable viruses.

A father from the anti-vaccination hotspot of Marin, California, petitioned to the school board in January to bar unvaccinated children from the school where his [6-year-old] son goes to school. Why? Because [his son] is a leukemia survivor, and he can't get a vaccine because his immune system is still recovering from 4 years of chemotherapy.

"If you choose not to immunize your own child and your own child dies because they get measles, OK, that's your responsibility, that's your choice," he said to NPR on 27 Jan 2015. "But if your child gets sick and gets my child sick and my child dies, then ... your action has harmed my child."

Another dad, a pediatrician of Phoenix, Arizona, wrote a scathing open letter to the mother who chose not to vaccinate her children and ended up exposing his 3-year-old daughter to measles when she sought treatment at a hospital. Like the other child, his daughter Maggie also has cancer, and is too immunocompromised to get vaccinated. He also has a 10-month-old son who is too young to get the 1st measles vaccination -- usually given somewhere between 12 to 15 months. From his letter:

Unvaccinating parent, thanks for screwing up our 3-week "vacation" from chemotherapy. Instead of a break, we get to watch for measles symptoms and pray for no fevers (or back to the hospital we go). Thanks for making us cancel our trip to the snow this year. Maggie really wanted to see snow, but we will not risk exposing anyone else. On that note, thanks for exposing 195 children to an illness considered 'eliminated' from the US. Your poor choices don't just effect your child. They affect my family and many more like us.

UNICEF Denies North Korean Measles Outbreak
-------------------------------------------
The United Nation Children's Fund (UNICEF) on Tuesday [31 Mar 2015] denied a media report that measles has broken out in North Korea. North Korea's government and the World Health Organization have advised UNICEF that "there are no reported outbreaks of measles," Christopher de Bono, the organization's regional spokesman in East Asia and the Pacific, told VOA [Voice of America] in a phone interview. Last week, the Voice of Russia/Sputnik International reported that measles broke out in the communist.

The UNICEF official said the agency regularly provides North Korea with vaccines for prevention. Starting in April [2015], the agency plans to provide vaccines for the 2nd quarter of the year. "We undertake regular vaccination. In 2014, UNICEF provided measles vaccines 4 times," de Bono said. The latest measles outbreak in North Korea occurred last July [2014], when UNICEF said the North Korean government reported several cases.

In November 2006, measles infected about 3000 people and caused at least several deaths. In response, UNICEF and the WHO vaccinated about 16 million people. UNICEF said it has been assisting the country's efforts to fight the disease since 1997 by providing vaccines, vaccination devices and supporting equipment.

The case of the measles that wasn't
-----------------------------------
Two cases of measles in Canterbury have been de-notified after public health staff realised the 2 cases were actually illnesses mimicking measles. Canterbury medical officer of health Alistair Humphrey told New Zealand Doctor the 2 cases turned out to be cases of enterovirus [infection] which was subsequently found to be circulating in the community. Symptoms included rash, fever and diarrhoea. The 2 cases of preschoolers were confirmed last month but Dr Humphrey says the lab tests were "weakly positive", giving an equivocal result.Both children were up to date with their immunisations, having had at least one dose of the MMR vaccine.

"Further lab tests combined with no identified source nor spread, other viruses known to be circulating which mimic measles and the cases' clinical picture, makes health authorities confident the cases were not measles," a media release from the Canterbury DHB says.

But Dr Humphrey says the public health unit was right to act on the information provided and he reminded GPs to always notify the public health authority of any suspicions of measles. He says de-notifying the cases was important from a New Zealand perspective because it means the country has been measles free for 6 months.
