Flavescence doree (FD) disease of grapevines has spread further in canton Valais. Authorities counted a total of 863 diseased vines in 8 communities, 5 of which are newly affected. In 2021, 3 foci of infection included 230 diseased vines. The cause of the extremely worrying increase in FD is not known. In 2004, the disease was detected for the 1st time in the country in canton Ticino. It is one of the quarantine diseases that must be reported under the Federal Plant Health Ordinance.

The canton is now taking measures to limit the risk of introducing the disease to new areas. All wine-growing communities are subject to special regulations until further notice, prohibiting movement of scions, potted vines, or rootstocks. Exceptions are only possible if they have been treated with hot water under official supervision [see comment below].

In defined areas where vectors are present, wine growers have to carry out 2 insecticide treatments in accordance with the specifications of the Department of Agriculture (DLW) for the next several years. In addition, they are obliged to monitor their vines more closely and report every vine with FD symptoms immediately to DLW.

[Flavescence doree (FD) is one of the most important and destructive diseases of grapevines due to its fast rate of spread within vineyards. The disease was first reported in 1954 in southern France and has been spreading in southern Europe. FD was thought to have been introduced from the US, the home of its primary vector. It is caused by a phytoplasma (_Candidatus_ Phytoplasma vitis) belonging to the 16SrV (elm yellows) group.

Symptoms can vary on different grape varieties and usually appear in late spring. They may include shortened internodes, stunting, leaves with downward rolled margins, as well as drooping shoots. Leaves turn yellow in white grape cultivars and red in red ones. Leaf necrosis and bark splitting may also develop; yield is severely reduced. Some vines die, usually in the year following infection. The survivors continue to harbour the pathogen but appear symptomless (latent infections) unless they are re-infected.

FD is spread by the vine leafhopper _Scaphoideus titanus_ and through infected propagation material. Symptomless budwood can carry both eggs of the vector and the pathogen. Reliable diagnosis in both symptomatic and asymptomatic host tissue by molecular methods is vital for disease management, which may include pathogen exclusion, certification of clean propagation material, and removal of infected plants (pathogen reservoirs). Insecticides can reduce vector numbers. The phytoplasma may be eliminated by treating dormant canes with hot water (heat therapy), as referred to above.

In Europe, a northward spread of the disease is being observed. The vector was reported to have overcome the Alps in the mid 1990s. The 1st report of FD from Germany in 2014 was the 1st report of FD north of the Alps; it was suspected to have been due to a quarantine incursion from infected Italian rootstocks (ProMED post 20141217.3038025). FD has since also been detected north of the Alps in Switzerland (ProMED post 20190107.6246980) and Austria, where it was also detected in ornamental _Clematis_ species (see link below). Previous to that, the only known natural hosts were _Vitis vinifera_ and hybrids, as well as some wild _Vitis_ species as asymptomatic infections. In Switzerland earlier on, strict quarantine measures could not prevent the spread of FD to eastern areas (ProMED post 20170320.4914128).

The _S. titanus_ vector, but so far not the phytoplasma, has also been reported in some additional areas in the region (e.g., Russia, ProMED post 20200909.7763574). The spread of FD in central Europe is considered another example of "warm climate diseases" moving into cooler regions due to climate change (see, for example, Esca disease of grapevine, ProMED post 20141024.2895414).
