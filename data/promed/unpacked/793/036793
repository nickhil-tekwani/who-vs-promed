Abbott Laboratories Inc. announced it has discovered a new strain of
hepatitis E virus in the United States. Called HEV-US-1, it is the third
recognized hepatitis E virus strain.
Hepatitis E virus is a major contributor to fulminant hepatitis and liver
failure in developing nations. Infection is devastating to pregnant women,
killing 10-20% of women infected in their third trimester.

[Given that this is being called a "strain" of hepatitis E virus (family
_Caliciviridae_, genus _Calicivirus_), I wonder what is the significance of
the term "strain". Most virologists consider a strain to be a variant of
some sort. Are "strains" of hepatitis E virus of more epidemiological
import than "strains" of other viruses? Are all hepatitis E strains
detected by routine diagnostic assays or must one have a separate kit for
each? Do their epidemiologies differ? Do these "strains" differ
sufficiently such that they be given different names? That is, are they
different viruses? Being an arbovirologist and baseball umpire, I simply do
not know the answers to these questions. Could someone enlighten me (us)?
