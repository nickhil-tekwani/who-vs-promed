Detection of a high-endemic focus of _Echinococcus multilocularis_ in red foxes in southern Denmark, January 2013
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[Authors: HL Enemark, MN Al-Sabi, J Knapp, M Staahl, M Chriel]

_Echinococcus multilocularis_ is endemic in large parts of Europe, and has been detected with increasing prevalence and geographical spread during the last decades, including in countries bordering Denmark, such as Germany, the Baltic States, and most recently Sweden. Humans may be accidental intermediate hosts and develop alveolar echinococcosis, one of the most severe zoonotic infections in the northern hemisphere. Infections in humans are rare but cause considerable public health concern due to treatment costs and high mortality if left untreated. In Denmark, infection with _E. multilocularis_ is notifiable in all animal species, but not for human cases.

_E. multilocularis_ was discovered for the 1st time in Denmark in 2000 in 3 of 1040 foxes (0.3 percent). However, all infected foxes were from the Copenhagen area (Zealand) which corresponds to a local prevalence of 0.9 percent (3 of 340 foxes). No additional national surveillance has been conducted in wild carnivores, but one of 169 clinical samples from domestic Danish cats, submitted to a diagnostic German laboratory for routine analyses in 2004-05, was found positive.

Following the detection of _E. multilocularis_ in a Swedish fox in 2011, a surveillance programme for _Echinococcus_ in wild carnivores was initiated in Denmark in Sep 2011. Included in the surveillance were road-killed and hunted animals collected by the Danish Nature Agency or by voluntary hunters. To date, a total of 679 wild carnivores, namely 546 foxes, 129 raccoon dogs (_Nyctereutes procyonoides_), 3 badgers (_Meles meles_), and one wolf (_Canis lupus_), have been examined by the sedimentation and counting technique.

The 1st positive fox was shot in November 2011 in Jutland close to the village Hojer, 8 km [5 mi] north of the border to Germany, and tested positive in April 2012. The fox was an adult male harbouring 20 adult tapeworms. In addition to morphological identification, these worms were analysed by PCR amplification and sequencing of the 12S rRNA gene, revealing a 200 bp product that was 100 percent identical to _E. multilocularis_ sequences in GenBank, such as, JX068642. Sub-genotyping by fragment size analysis of the EmsB microsatellite marker was done to compare the genetic profile with other European isolates. The results revealed no close relationship to other isolates analysed so far.

In January 2013, 3 additional foxes from the same area, shot within a radius of 10 km [6.2 mi], were detected positive for _E. multilocularis_ by the sedimentation and counting technique. These foxes, all adult females, were shot in September and November 2012, and harboured 2, 7, and 27 adult tapeworms, respectively. Molecular analysis of these worms is ongoing. Until now a total of 13 foxes (of which 4 were positive) and 3 raccoon dogs (all negative) from this area have been examined for infection with _E. multilocularis_ corresponding to a local prevalence of 31 percent (95 percent confidence interval (CI): 7-55) in foxes. Based on the preliminary surveillance data, the countrywide prevalence of _E. multilocularis_ is 0.7 percent. So far infection with _E. multilocularis_ has not been detected in wild carnivores other than foxes in Denmark.

A local prevalence of over 30 percent in foxes is worrying, and even if based on a small number of foxes, poses an increased risk of transmission to humans as well as dogs and cats. On this background the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration has recommended since 18 Feb 2013 that dogs in Tonder municipality (that is, southern Denmark) that are allowed to roam freely in the countryside (including hunting dogs), are dewormed regularly with praziquantel every 4th week.

Due to the long incubation time of alveolar echinococcosis, an increased prevalence of _E. multilocularis_ in the fox population will not immediately be reflected in an increased incidence of alveolar echinococcosis among humans. However, as alveolar echinococcosis spreads in a tumour-like manner it can be misdiagnosed as liver cancer. Alveolar echinococcosis should therefore be considered as a differential diagnosis, and may become increasingly important in the future.

Worm burdens detected in Danish foxes so far have been low, which is a diagnostic challenge. On the other hand, fewer worms excrete fewer eggs and these foxes probably do not contaminate the environment as much as foxes with large worm burdens. Nevertheless, a local prevalence of this magnitude emphasised the need for re-evaluating risk management and risk communication in the region, and calls for increased awareness among veterinarians as well as physicians.
