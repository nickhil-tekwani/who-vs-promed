Officials unsure what sickened luncheon guests; Tests to show whether
it was flu or food
------------------
Oakland County health officials are trying to determine whether more
than a dozen people who became ill after a Saturday luncheon at the
Community House in Birmingham may have been stricken with food
poisoning.

About 240 people ate tuna, chicken, and egg salads at the luncheon,
sponsored by Sharing & Caring, a breast cancer support and awareness
program run by Beaumont Hospital.

Some of those who attended reported stomach flu-like symptoms,
including vomiting and diarrhea, beginning Sunday. Community House
officials learned of the complaints Tuesday and contacted the Oakland
County Health Division, who sent inspectors. Health officials said
Thursday it was too soon to say whether it was food poisoning or a
stomach flu, common this time of year.

Investigators also were looking at the Norwalk virus [norovirus] as a
possible culprit -- the same bug that shut down several cruise ships
in recent months.

Oakland County health officials inspected the Community House kitchen
on Tuesday afternoon. They took samples of leftovers from the
luncheon, but said they found no evidence of the bacteria that cause
food poisoning.

Health officials also were perplexed, because guests at a wedding
reception in the same place later that evening showed no signs of
illness.

Health Division Manager George Miller said results from tests done on
the patients could be available in a week.

It was unlikely, doctors said, that the temporary illness would
interfere with the treatment that cancer patients receive; some of
them attended the luncheon.

County records show the Community House has no prior record of
problems with health inspections violations.

[In the above newswire article there is mention that the outbreak is
either Norovirus or a foodborne outbreak -- with the apparent
increase in norovirus activity in the past year in the USA, Canada
and the UK, many of which were associated with high profile press
coverage due to shutting down of acute care medical facilities and
cancellations of cruise ship tours, it appears as though it has been
forgotten that norovirus has also been implicated in foodborne
outbreaks (see prior ProMED-mail postings listed below, and a few
selected references listed below). Hence, upon reading the article,
this moderator's first response was "both" (this could be a foodborne
outbreak caused by norovirus).
