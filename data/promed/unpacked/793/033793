The Department of Health is today [Mon 6 Jun 2006] issuing the latest
information about the numbers of known cases of Creutzfeldt Jakob
disease. This includes cases of variant Creutzfeldt Jakob disease
[abbreviated in ProMED-mail as CJD (new var.) or vCJD], the form of
the disease thought to be linked to BSE (bovine spongiform
encephalopathy).
Definite and probable CJD cases in the UK, as of Fri 2 Jun 2006:
Summary of vCJD Cases - Deaths
-----------------------------
Deaths from definite vCJD (confirmed): 111
Deaths from probable vCJD (without neuropathological confirmation): 44
Deaths from probable vCJD (neuropathological confirmation pending): 1
Number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD (as above): 156
Summary of vCJD Cases - Alive
-----------------------------
Number of probable vCJD cases still alive: 5
Total
-----
Number of definite or probable vCJD (dead and alive): 161
(The next table will be published on Mon 3 Jul 2006).
[Since the previous monthly statistics were released on Mon 8 May
2006, the total number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD has
increased by one. Consequently, the overall total is now 156. The
number of vCJD cases still alive has declined by one, therefore the
overall total number of definite or probable vCJD cases (dead and
alive) remains 161.
These data are consistent with the view that the vCJD outbreak in the
UK is now in decline (see following report). The number of deaths due
to definite or probable vCJD in the UK during the 12 months of 2005
remains 5. The peak number of deaths was 28 in the year 2000,
followed by 20 in 2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in 2003, and 9 in 2004, 5 in
2005, and so far 3 in 2006. - Mod.CP]
Totals for All Types of CJD Cases in the UK during 2005
-----------------------------------------------
As of 2 Jun 2006, in the UK in the year 2005, there were 122
referrals of suspected CJD, and there were 63 deaths from sporadic
CJD, 6 from familial CJD, 3 from iatrogenic CJD, 6 GSS
(Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker) syndrome cases, and 5 deaths from
vCJD. The corresponding figures so far for the 1st 5 months of 2006
are: 35 referrals, 23 deaths from sporadic CJD, 3 from vCJD, 2 from
familial CJD, one from GSS and none from iatrogenic CJD.

[2] UK: New Human Genotype Susceptible to Variant CJD

Evidence of a New Human Genotype Susceptible to Variant CJD
-----------------------------------------------
There is now evidence that a new human genotype is susceptible to
variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) infection [1]. A previous
prevalence study showed accumulation of prion protein (a marker of
vCJD infection) in 3 out of 12 674 appendix and tonsil specimens,
which is more than expected based on the current number of reported
clinical cases [3]. In this recent study, the prion protein gene
(PRNP) was sequenced for 2 of the 3 positive samples (the 3rd sample
was not available for analysis). These 2 positive samples were found
to be valine homozygous (VV) at codon 129 of the PRNP. This genotype
is present in approximately 10 percent of the UK population [1]. This
is the 1st time that evidence of vCJD infection has been found in
codon 129 valine homozygotes.
To date, there have been 191 definite or probable clinical cases of
vCJD reported worldwide; 161 in the United Kingdom (UK), a further 25
from other European countries and 5 cases outside Europe. All of
those tested have been methionine homozygous (MM) at codon 129 in the
PRNP, which is found in approximately 40 percent of the UK
population. There has also been one previous case of iatrogenic
infection (via a blood transfusion) reported in a patient who was
methionine/valine heterozygous at PRNP codon 129 (MV). It is
estimated that 50 percent of the UK population are heterozygous at
codon 129 of this gene [2].
Important implications
----------------------
This new information on the PRNP codon 129 genotype shows that the
entire UK population (that is, all PRNP codon 129 genotypes) is
susceptible to vCJD infection, which was not known before. The
immunohistochemical technique used in the prevalence study appears to
be specific, but is unlikely to be 100 percent sensitive, suggesting
that the true prevalence in the UK population may be even greater
than estimated from the study. Therefore, these results indicate that
there may be a large subgroup of the population who are carriers for
the disease (60 percent of people with non-MM genotypes) and that
such carriers may have a long incubation period or may die before
developing CJD. These findings are supported by studies of kuru and
recent studies in transgenic mice, which show that PRNP codon 129 MV
and VV genotypes are associated with longer incubation periods, and
possibly with different phenotypes, than MM genotypes [4,5,6].
These findings have important public health implications, as these
carriers may be able to spread the disease through blood transfusion,
through surgical procedures or through organ or tissue donation. A
self-sustaining secondary epidemic is possible, unless measures are
taken to prevent it. Accordingly, countries throughout the world have
implemented various public health measures in an attempt to prevent
such an outcome. However, until a reliable test becomes available, we
must rely on measures such as excluding certain blood donors with
identifiable risk, leucoreduction of blood components, enhanced
decontamination of medical and surgical equipment and the development
of technologies such as prion filters for blood.
In addition to implementing these essential public health measures,
we must continue surveillance of vCJD in order to detect the
possibility of MV and VV codon 129 genotypes presenting with
different clinical phenotypes and to continue to monitor for
secondary transmission of vCJD infection. Another priority is to try
and determine the prevalence of subclinical vCJD infection in the UK
population. This is being undertaken in the UK by the Health
Protection Agency in the form of a National Anonymous Tonsil Archive
[7].
