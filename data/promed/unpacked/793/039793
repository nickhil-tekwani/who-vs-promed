California Olive and Vine, LLC of Sutter, [California] is taking precautionary measures and voluntarily recalling Pumpkin Seed Pesto because of irregular lab results. The company found that the jarred pesto may have been improperly processed, making it susceptible to contamination with _Clostridium botulinum_.

This food product was distributed under the Williams-Sonoma label, nationwide, since September 2014. The product labels have the following SKU numbers 6404305, 6389043 and is sold in an 8 ounce glass jar, as pictured (http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm418640.htm). The company has made the deliberate decision to recall this product to ensure the safety of their customers. The company has not been notified of any illness associated with this product.

No other products from this company are affected.

Ingestion of botulism toxin may lead to serious illness and death. To date, there have been no reports of any illnesses or contamination of the product. Symptoms from botulism are as follows: general weakness, dizziness, double vision and trouble with speaking or swallowing. Difficulty in breathing, weakness of other muscles, abdominal distention, and constipation may also be common symptoms. People experiencing these problems should seek immediate medical attention.

Consumers are warned not to use the product even if it does not look or smell spoiled.

California Olive and Vine immediately segregated its entire inventory of this product and has notified Williams-Sonoma and CDPH directly. Consumers who have purchased the recalled Pumpkin Seed Pesto are urged to dispose of the product or return it to the place of purchase for a refund.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if there are no human cases associated with the food products. Most of the food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures that could, but do not necessarily, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_ although here it appears the risk is real because of the report of 2 cases linked to the canned pesto in Ohio. It is important that the product has been sold throughout the USA via the internet. Computer records from the seller, hopefully, should make it easy to contact all the buyers.

When the motor neuron action potential depolarizes the axon terminal, acetylcholine is released from the cytosol into the synaptic cleft. Botulism occurs when usually preformed toxin is absorbed through the intestinal tract and when the botulinum toxin is exposed to the neuromuscular junction, the heavy chain of the botulinum neurotoxin binds to glycoprotein structures specifically found on cholinergic nerve terminals. This specific docking is the reason for BT high selectivity for cholinergic synapses. After internalization, the light chain of the botulinum neurotoxin binds with high specificity to the SNARE protein complex. The target proteins vary among the BT serotypes. BT-A cleaves synaptosomal-associated proteins of 25kDa (SNAP-25). BT-B cleaves vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP), also known as synaptobrevin II.

An October 2013 article in PLoS Pathogens (1) found that several auxiliary proteins produced by the organism bound to botulinum toxin A and facilitated its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract via multivalent interactions with carbohydrate receptors on intestinal epithelial cells. Indeed, in mice it seemed possible to block the neuromuscular effects of botulinum toxin by blocking absorption using a non-metabolizable galactose analog called isopropyl beta-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside and prolonged median survival time. The same group more recently, in June 2014, published (2) that the same hemagglutinin complex of the progenitor toxin complex bound to E-cadherin, a cell adhesion molecule, as well as carbohydrate binding and facilitated paracellular absorption of the toxin complex. Abolishing either the E-cadherin or carbohydrate binding of the toxin complex drastically reduced oral toxicity.
