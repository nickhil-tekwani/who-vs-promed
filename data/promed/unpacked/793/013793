The distribution of equine infectious anemia (EIA) is interesting in
the sense that some countries (covering a wide area) in Europe are
affected, while others have been free of the disease for
decades. For example, Denmark last saw EIA in 1928, Norway in 1975,
Poland in 1960, Hungary in 1965, Spain in 1983 and U.K. in 1976. On
the other hand, the following countries have all reported the disease
within the last 5 years: Ireland, Germany, France, Greece, Austria,
Ukraine and Lithuania. It is hard to discern a geographic pattern
but that is what makes epidemiology so interesting. - Mod.PC]
