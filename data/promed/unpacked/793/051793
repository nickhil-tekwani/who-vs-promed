A 41 year old woman continues in the intensive care unit of the Regional
Hospital Dr Joaquin Pablo Franco Sayas, with a clinical picture positive
for [a] hantavirus [infection], according to physicians' examinations. The
patient was transferred as an emergency from the Valle Rico community in
Las Tablas, Los Santos province. She is the 2nd case of hantavirus
[infection] in Los Santos and the 3rd in the Azuero [Peninsula].

Up to now, a hantavirus death has been reported, involving a 39 year old
man who lived in Herrera province but worked in Santo Domingo de Las Tablas.

The authorities maintain a surveillance operation in Valle Rico, where the
patient comes from.

[As indicated earlier for cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in Panama,
the hantavirus most likely to be the etiological agent in these cases is
Choclo virus. As mentioned in ProMED-mail archive number 20081027.3389,
hantaviruses (and their rodent hosts) recognized in Panama include Rio
Segundo (_Reithrodontomys mexicanus_), Choclo (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens
(costaricensis)_), and Calabazo (_Zygodontomys brevicauda (cherriei)_). Of
these 3 viruses, only Choclo is a known human pathogen, causing hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome.
