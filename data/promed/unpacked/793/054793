Since the last update on 4 Aug 2017, 32 more ill people were added to this investigation from 15 states. As of 9 Aug 2017, 141 people infected with the outbreak strains of _Salmonella_ Kiambu (51) or _Salmonella_ Thompson (90) have been reported from 19 states. A list of the states and the number of cases in each:

States / Case Count
Connecticut / 5
Delaware / 4
Iowa / 2
Illinois / 2
Kentucky / 3
Louisiana / 2
Maryland / 8
Massachusetts / 6
Michigan / 1
Minnesota / 4
North Carolina / 3
New Jersey / 27
New York / 39
Ohio / 1
Oklahoma / 4
Pennsylvania / 8
Texas / 7
Virginia / 14
Wisconsin / 1
Total / 141

Illnesses started on dates ranging from 17 May 2017 to 27 Jul 2017. Ill people range in age from less than one year to 95, with a median age of 39. Among 136 ill people with available information, 83 (61%) are female. Among 98 people with available information, 66 (67%) are of Hispanic ethnicity. Among 103 people with available information, 45 (44%) have been hospitalized. One death was reported from New York City.

Illnesses that occurred after 14 Jul 2017 might not be reported yet due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2 to 4 weeks.

Investigation Update
-----------------
Based on information collected to date, CDC is now recommending that consumers not eat Maradol papayas from the Carica de Campeche farm in Mexico. If consumers aren't sure whether their Maradol papaya came from the Carica de Campeche farm, they should ask the place of purchase. When in doubt, don't eat it; just throw it out. Restaurants and retailers should not serve or sell Maradol papayas from the Carica de Campeche farm.

As was reported in the last update on 4 Aug 2017, FDA tested other papayas imported from Mexico and isolated several types of +Salmonella_ bacteria, including _S._ Agona, _S._ Kiambu, _S._ Gaminara, _S._ Thompson, and _S._ Senftenberg. CDC is working to determine whether there are any illnesses with these other types of _Salmonella_ linked to this outbreak.

This investigation is ongoing. Updates will be provided when more information is available.

[It is interesting that the epi curve supplied with the outbreak report shows that the serotype Kiambu cases occurred 1st, and the more recent cases are almost all serotype Thompson (https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/kiambu-07-17/epi.html). We await the overall scope of the outbreak. - Mod.LL
