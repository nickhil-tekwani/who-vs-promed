Hundreds of thousands of cattle, goats and sheep throughout the country [Lebanon] are set to be vaccinated in an effort to combat diseases like foot-and-mouth disease [FMD], amid findings showing that the breakdown of security in Syria is fueling the spread of livestock infections in Lebanon.

According to the Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO], only about half of the country's cattle are vaccinated against FMD, much lower than the recommended minimum of 80 percent.

In addition, 84 percent of Lebanese farmers reported that at least one animal in their herd had FMD or PPR [peste des petits ruminants] in the past year, prompting the FAO to propose the vaccination campaign in an effort to ramp up surveillance of the disease, vaccinations, and quarantine and control efforts.

"We are going to vaccinate cattle, goats and sheep in the whole country," said Markos Tibbo, the regional livestock officer for the Near East and North Africa at the FAO of the United Nations, which 1st proposed the program. "It is a blanket vaccination, no clemency."

Altogether, 58 000 cattle, 277 000 sheep and 424 000 goats will be vaccinated in the project, which will cost USD 3 million and is funded by the United Kingdom.

The vaccination campaign will target 3 main diseases: FMD, PPR, and lumpy skin disease [LSD].

FMD is a highly contagious disease among animals. PPR, also known as the "goat plague," usually affects sheep and goats and can cause symptoms like fever, sores, diarrhea and death among the animals.

LSD affects cattle and is also very infectious. All 3 diseases are associated with major economic losses to farming communities.

Tibbo said the crisis in Syria caused a breakdown of field veterinary services, putting a halt to livestock vaccination programs there for the last year and a half.

Unvaccinated animals are now mixing with neighbors' livestock, as refugees fleeing across the porous border arrive with their herds. Animals are then sold at lower prices to Lebanese farmers.

"The threat of these diseases will increase to the Lebanese livestock," Tibbo said.

This poses additional challenges for Lebanese farmers because few farm animals are usually vaccinated.

The additional pressure from unvaccinated animals entering into the country will only make the situation "much, much worse," Tibbo said.

The need for stricter measures is evident in the emergence of livestock diseases that never existed in the country. Though FMD and PPR have been present in the region for years, lumpy skin disease was only discovered in Lebanon at the end of 2012, and officially reported to World Animal Health Organization in January [2013].

The disease was originally discovered in Africa, but has now been reported in Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Turkey and Iraq. The virus is transmitted by insect vectors or carriers such as flies.

"Once it is established in the herd, it is very difficult to clear it," Tibbo said. "It's a threat for the whole region."

The Lebanese disease prevention and control program is intended as a pilot that can be followed by the rest of the region.

Though border areas are considered the most vulnerable, the spread of transboundary diseases among livestock respects no lines in the sand.

"Diseases do not respect borders," Tibbo said. "Whatever happens next door can happen here."

Still, Tibbo said it was important to protect the livelihoods of poorer communities, particularly those hosting Syrian refugees fleeing the violence next door.

Doing so will help sustain communities broken up by war, as well as provide support to the Lebanese communities hosting them.

"When the system breaks, anything can happen," he said. "Building a wall is not a solution."

Health Minister Hussein Hajj Hasan will launch the campaign officially Friday [8 Nov 2013].

[The concerning epizootic situation in the region is adequately covered in the above item; FAO and the UK sponsors deserve to be praised for the steps undertaken to enhance the required control measures.

Among the 3 transboundary diseases mentioned, the most recent introduction -- namely LSD -- deserves special attention, in view of its potential to continue its spread eastwards in Asia and westwards into the Balkans, affecting the susceptible cattle population. The inclusion of Iraq among the list of countries already affected deserves to be officially confirmed: Iraq, similarly to Syria, has not reported LSD (yet) to the OIE.

LSD has been reported in the past in captive wildlife in Oman, Saudi Arabia and UAE; an RFI for the situation in domestic cattle is pending (see ProMED-mail post 20130724.1842366).

For LSD, live attenuated vaccines only are available, using either a specific lumpy skin disease virus or a cross-protecting sheep and goat pox virus. It will be helpful to obtain information about the vaccine type (strain) applied in Lebanon.

A wide-scale comparative field trial, applying 2 vaccines (sheep pox, LSD) has been undertaken in Israel during 2013. Results, in case available, may provide useful data for other countries in the region. - Mod.AS]
