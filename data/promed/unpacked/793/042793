Public Health - Human Contact Tracing related to canine rabies in Ontario
on 23 Jan 2008, the Public Health Division, MOHLTC, Ontario was alerted to
a confirmed case of canine rabies with human contact occurring in the
Toronto area. The details of the canine case and subsequent human contact
tracing and public health investigation to date are summarized below:
A litter of 8 Border collie cross puppies (primary litter) was born on 10
Nov 2007 on a farm in Perth County. The adult female contacted a skunk on
25 Nov 2007 and [the adult female dog] was found dead on 12 Dec 2007. She
may have died up to 3 days earlier. On 3 Jan 2008, 4 surviving puppies were
sold to a puppy vendor who took them to a kennel in Grey Bruce County.
Between 5 Jan 2008 and 13 Jan 2008 the primary litter was sold at a flea
market in west Toronto. One of the primary litter puppies became ill and
following an assessment was surrendered to a Toronto animal shelter. That
puppy died on 15 Jan2008. Due to an exposure in the shelter, the animal was
tested and confirmed on 21 Jan 2008 to have died with rabies.
Post-exposure preventative therapy (PET) was given to the exposed staff.
An animal health and public health investigation was initiated by
authorities in Ontario. A number of other puppies were potentially mixed
with the primary litter and also sold by the same puppy vendor. Due to the
environment in the flea market, an unknown number of buyers and other
persons may have come into contact with the primary litter of puppies;
including the known infected puppy who died. In addition, other puppies
managed and sold by the same vendor may also have had contact with the
rabies infected puppy, and these puppies may have had subsequent owners and
other human contact.
Coordination of the public health investigation and contact tracing
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Toronto Public Health took the lead on the local investigation at the flea
market. In addition, local Public Health units in the Regions of Perth,
Grey Bruce, Peel, York, Durham, Halton, Simcoe, and others have also been
involved in contact investigations. Coordination of the public health
response has been provided by the Public Health Division, MOHLTC of
Ontario. Canadian Food Inspection Agency and the Animal Health, Public
Health Agency of Canada have been supporting the public health response.
Current status: Puppies from the primary litter (4 including the index
canine rabies case) plus an additional 23 puppies (total 27) were
potentially sold by a single puppy vendor in the window from 3 Jan - 20 Jan
2008. An additional 9 puppies were identified at the home of the puppy
vendor (personal pets). The risk of the secondary animals being affected or
transmitting rabies to a human has been assessed as low by the animal
authorities, but are being managed by CFIA and Animal Health in
collaboration with public health officials.
No human cases of rabies have been detected at this time due to this event.
An enhanced surveillance system has been activated to link animal exposure
(primary litter plus others) through the puppy vendor. Human contact risk
assessment is being done by multiple local health units. An on-going effort
is being made to align the animal sales, owners' records and the human
contact assessment databases.
To date (28 Jan 2008), 246 persons have been assessed by the local public
health unit staff to have had a significant animal contact and PET has been
recommended for these people. Rabies vaccine and rabies immune globulin
supply management is being provided by Public Health Division.
Additional relevant information will be posted as it comes available.
