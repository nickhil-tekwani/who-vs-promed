There was a recent update today on National Public Radio wherein Dr Louise
MacFarland stated that the Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) epidemic [in
Louisiana, USA seems to be cooling off as the number of new equine cases
confirmed has slowed since the same time last month. The present confirmed
total is 66 horses.
In talking with Steve Nicholson, the extension service veterinarian, [we
learned some 5 horses have been found affected in Webster parish, 35 miles
east of Shreveport and on the Arkansas border. In his opinion, the disease
is effectively statewide and seriously under-reported.
A lamb in Lafourche parish has been confirmed with EEE and the virus [was
recovered.
