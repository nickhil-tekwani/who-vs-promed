The Michigan Department of Health and Human services is confirming the 1st case of measles in the state this year [2017].

The state announced [Wed 29 Mar 2017] that a person in southeastern Michigan is being hospitalized after recently traveling internationally and getting sick.

There was one confirmed case last year [2016] of measles in Michigan. Nationally in 2014 there were 667 cases, including 5 in Michigan. A majority of those cases involved people who were not vaccinated.

The state notes that measles is a highly contagious illness and vaccinations are an effective way to prevent it. Measles typically will start with a high fever, red eyes, runny nose, sensitivity to light, and eventually rashes on the face and head that progress to other parts of the body.

[While the country where this individual traveled and was assumed to have been exposed to measles virus is not identified, this report once again points to the problem of exposure during travel to regions where measles has not been controlled even though measles in one's country of origin may be essentially eliminated. Thus, it remains important to maintain a high level of vaccine immunity in the population.

A 27-year-old Taiwanese man has been confirmed to have the nation's 3rd case of imported measles this year [2017], the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said on [Tue 28 Mar 2017], adding that the man became infected while on vacation in Europe.

The man, who lives in northern Taiwan, visited France, Belgium and the Netherlands as a member of a tour group from [7 Mar--15 Mar 2017]. He transferred flights in Bangkok before returning to Taiwan, CDC Deputy Director-General Philip Lo said.

The man 1st went to a clinic complaining of a fever on [Sun 19 Mar 2017], then returned on [Thu 23 Mar 2017] last week when his symptoms persisted, Lo said, adding that the next day [Fri 24 Mar 2017], after developing a rash, he sought treatment at a hospital.

The hospital reported the case and asked the man to quarantine himself at home, Lo said, adding that test results on [Tue 28 Mar 2017] confirmed that he has measles.

"Measles can easily be misdiagnosed as hives, which is caused by an allergic reaction," Lo said. "Measles has an incubation period of about 7 days and the man was likely infected during his vacation in Europe."

Outbreaks of measles have been reported in European countries and in Thailand, so the centers are unable to specify the exact location where he became infected, but it is monitoring the condition of 166 people who came into direct contact with the man after his return to Taiwan, he said.

A unique feature of measles is that a rash usually appears on the head and neck that then spreads to the rest of the body, Lo said.

"All 3 cases of measles reported this year [2017] were imported from abroad," he said, adding that of other nations in the region, China has reported the most measles cases -- about 1200 -- this year [2017].

The prevalence of the disease in Europe seems to be increasing, with Romania bearing the brunt of infections, reporting about 3800 cases this year [2017], he said. [See ProMED Measles update (15) 20170329.4934570 for summary of activity in Europe. - Mod.LK]

Vaccinations are the best prevention for the disease, and the centers encourage parents to take their children for a measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine before their 1st birthday, he said.

About 20 percent of Taiwanese in their 20s and 30s might not have immunity against measles, so they should request an MMR vaccine at least 2 weeks before they travel to areas where the disease has been reported, he said.

[Measles activity in Europe has been on the rise, as stated in this report and in the WHO summary report included in the previous ProMED measles post - See ProMED reference above. Therefore people vacationing or conducting business in Europe should confirm their MMR vaccination status before traveling.

Peel Public Health is investigating a confirmed case of measles in a child from Mississauga. Members of the public may have been exposed to measles in a number of settings in Mississauga during the period of 25--27 Mar 2017.

A list of locations and times where people may have been exposed to measles can be found at the URL above. The virus can only live outside the body (e.g., on surfaces and door handles) for up to 2 hours, so people who visited these locations at other times were not exposed.

If people think they were exposed to the virus, they should
- Check their immunization records to make sure they and their children have had 2 doses of the measles vaccine (MMR or MMRV). Their immunization record (yellow card) or doctor can provide this information.
- Two doses of measles vaccine are recommended for anyone born after 1969.
- Watch for symptoms of measles until 21 days after exposure. These include a high fever, cold-like symptoms (cough/runny nose); sore eyes or sensitivity to light; small spots with a white centre on the inside of the mouth; and a red rash lasting 4 -- 7 days.

Peel Public Health is working with the exposure sites to identify and follow up with anyone who visited the locations listed during the times listed and may be at risk. Anyone who shows symptoms should call their health care provider immediately and tell them they have been exposed to measles. DO NOT go to any medical facility without telling them before the appointment that you have been exposed to measles.

Measles is a highly contagious disease that spreads easily through the air. Anyone who has not had 2 doses of a measles vaccine (MMR or MMRV) or who has not had measles in the past is at risk of infection. Infants under 1 year of age, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems can get very ill with measles.

Peel is also experiencing an increase in mumps activity with 8 cases this year [2017] to date. Ensuring your MMR immunizations are up-to-date is the best way to protect against measles and mumps. Concerned residents should visit http://peelregion.ca/health for news and alerts about measles and mumps.

In Italy, already in the 1st 3 months of this year [2017], 1010 cases of measles were recorded. As high as 86 percent of these were divided among 5 of Italy's regions (Piedmont, Lombardy, Lazio, Tuscany and Abruzzo) and 90 percent of the cases involved individuals who had not been vaccinated. Children in the 0--14 age range represented 26 percent of the total, and 50 of these had less than 1 year of age when they got ill.

This situation is considered an emergency that has prompted the Health Minister and Italy's National Health Institute (ISS) to disseminate a weekly bulletin in order to better monitor the phenomenon.

Measles in Italy: Weekly bulletin Update as of 28 Mar (week of 20--26 Mar)
Source: National Integrated Measles Rubella Surveillance System 1010 cases from 1 Jan 2017 90 percent unvaccinated 33 percent reported 1 or more complications 41 percent hospitalized 113 cases among health care workers Median age 27-year-old.
