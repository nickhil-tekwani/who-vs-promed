[1] Cholera - Iran (Tehran, Qom)

Health officials have imposed emergency measures in Iran to contain
an outbreak of cholera, with bans in some cities on the sale of raw
salad greens and street food vendors as well as penalties for
businesses that do not heed the warnings.

Officials fear the disease, spread through contaminated water or
food, has been brought in from neighboring Pakistan and Afghanistan.

Hasan Emami Razavi, the deputy health minister, said on Tuesday [26
Aug 2008], 96 people, including 18 Pakistani and Afghan nationals,
have contracted the disease in the past month, and 4 people,
including an elderly man in Tehran, have died.

Fars News Agency, yesterday [26 Aug 2008], reported a 9-year-old
Afghan girl also died, possibly of cholera. The report has not been
confirmed by the health ministry.

In Qom [Qom province] and Karaj [Tehran province], the 2 cities worst
hit by the disease, health officials have banned the sale and supply
of salad and other greens as well as prepared dishes containing these
raw ingredients. Businesses ignoring the warnings face being shut
down. Qom, 183 km (114 mi) south of Tehran, is Iran's 2nd largest holy city.

Millions of Iranians and Shiites from other countries, including
Afghanistan and Pakistan, flock to the city every year to pay their
respects to the shrine of Lady Fatemeh Masoumeh, the daughter of the
7th Shiite Imam. The 1st cases of cholera were reported in Qom in August 2008.

Karaj, 35 km (22 mi) west of the capital, is Iran's 5th largest city
with a population of 1.3 million. After Tehran, it has the largest
number of Afghan immigrants and refugees.

Yesterday [26 Aug 2008], the health ministry said there was no threat
to Tehran from the cholera outbreak.

In 1998, an outbreak of cholera in Iraq that spread to Iran infected
10 000 and killed 100 people. Last September [2007], Iran's Haj and
Pilgrimage Organization suspended sending pilgrims to Iraq after 57
people who had visited the country or been in contact with others
returning from there were diagnosed with cholera.

Sources say 2 children have died in Iraq from what is suspected to be
cholera, which has been blamed for at least 28 other similar
infections. Medical sources in Baghdad said there are 30 suspected
cases of the potentially deadly bacterial infection in Iraq,
including a 3-year-old and a 6-year-old who are dead, the Kuwait News
Agency KUNA reported Thursday [28 Aug 2008].

The total of 29 suspected cases and one diagnosed case of cholera
come after a major outbreak of the disease hit Iraq in July 2007,
KUNA said. Sources told the news agency that contaminated water was
likely to blame for the disease's 2007 spread and for the deaths of
at least 9 other people before the outbreak was contained in October 2007.

A 3-year-old child died of cholera in the Maysan province in southern
Iraq, raising fears of spreading the disease throughout the country,
a provincial medical source said on Thursday [28 Aug 2008].

"The child died on Wednesday in the town of al-Auzeir, 70 km (43.5
mi) south of the provincial capital of Amara, by cholera disease,"
Jamal al-Alawi, spokesman of Maysan health directorate told Xinhua.
He said that the child was among 23 similar cases in the province
that detected suffer from acute watery diarrhea. Alawi's announcement
raised fears among Iraqis that the disease could widely spread across
the country.

In 2007, cholera epidemic spread in 9 Iraqi provinces out of 18
across the country. According to World Health Organization (WHO),
more than 30 000 people had acute watery diarrhea, among which 3315
were identified as positive for _Vibrio cholera_.

[6] Cholera - Zimbabwe (Mashonaland East)

Health officials said Thursday [4 Sep 2008], 2 people have died and
23 are in hospital following an outbreak of cholera in one of
Harare's crowded townships, The outbreak occurred on Monday [1 Sep
2008] in Chitungwiza, a dormitory township of about a million people
on Harare's southern outskirts where sewerage routinely flows through
the streets and people's yards.

Chitungwiza hospital chief executive Obadiah Moyo said the
institution had dealt with a total of 34 people with the disease, but
said "we have enough medication for all the cholera victims."

"Residents of this area have been getting their water from
unprotected wells because there is no proper water supply system,"
said Chitungwiza town clerk Godfrey Tanyanyiwa. "We suspect these
wells could have been contaminated by burst sewer pipes."

Residential areas nearly all over the Zimbabwean capital often suffer
broken sewerage pipes and open streams of raw sewerage are visible in
all poor townships. Zimbabwe has suffered several cholera outbreaks
in recent years following the collapse of infrastructure due to the
country's political and economic crisis.
