African Horse Sickness Not Confirmed
-----------------------------------------------------
The South African authorities reported an outbreak of African Horse
Sickness (AHS) at Kunnenburg, Paarl, Western Cape Province (OIE,
2007). This outbreak was in the AHS surveillance zone approximately
50 km from the European Union (EU) approved export zone for
registered horses in municipal Cape Town. Subsequent detailed
confirmation tests have now indicated that AHS virus was not involved
in this incident (European Commission, 2007).
As a consequence of the initial official outbreak report, Defra
banned imports of horses from South Africa as from 23 Mar 2007.
On the basis of the new official update, horses may now continue to
be imported under specified EU rules. These rules are considered
sufficient to mitigate the likelihood of the introduction of AHS
virus to a negligible level via legal trade in horses. That is,
temporary admissions and permanent imports of registered horses are
allowed subject to quarantine and official certification. These
imports are only permitted from the "AHS-free zone" in the municipal
area of Cape Town, Western Cape Province. For this purpose, South
Africa has established 3 zones within the Western Cape Province. A
map of the AHS control zones in the Western Cape Province may be seen at:

%20RSA.pdf>
As a result of the new official information received, there will be
no longer any justifiable grounds for maintaining the recently
imposed Defra's ban on the importation of horses from South Africa to
the UK under the existing EU rules. Defra will nevertheless continue
to monitor the AHS developments in South Africa.

The exclusion of AHS as the causative agent of the described case
might be indicative of a possible different etiology; a plausible
candidate is the equine encephalosis (EE) virus. This disease has
already been suspected in South Africa earlier this year [2007] (see
20070417.1272).
EE is a subclinical to mild, occasionally peracute, arthropod-borne
diseases of horses. The causative orbivirus was 1st recognised in
South Africa following its sudden appearance during the early months
of 1967. Subsequent serological studies have shown it to be both
widespread and prevalent in southern Africa. Like other orbiviruses
(eg Bluetongue, AHS, Epizootic haemorrhagic disease) it is
transmitted by culicoides. So far, EE has not been recorded in other
parts of the world; the hazard of its possible spread to Europe has
recently been raised by EFSA experts (see in:

Information from South Africa on the final diagnosis of the recent
case, particularly in relation to EE, will be appreciated. - Mod.AS]
