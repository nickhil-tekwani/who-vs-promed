Abstract
---------
Pathogenic strains of _Escherichia coli_ threaten public health due to their virulence factors and antibiotic resistance. Additionally, the virulence of this bacterium varies by region depending on environmental conditions, agricultural practices, and the use of antibiotics and disinfectants. However, there is limited research on the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant _E. coli_ in agriculture. Therefore, this research aimed to determine the antibiotic resistance of _E. coli_ isolated from the Honeydew melon production system in Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico. Thirty-two _E. coli_ strains were isolated from 445 samples obtained from irrigation water, harvested melons, the hands of packaging workers, boxes, and discarded melons. The resistance profile of the _E. coli_ strains was carried out to 12 antibiotics used in antimicrobial therapeutics against this bacterium; a high level of resistance to ertapenem (100%) was detected, followed by meropenem (97%), and ampicillin (94%); 47% of the strains were classified as multidrug-resistant. It was possible to identify the prevalence of the extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBLs) gene blaTEM (15.6%), as well as the non-ESBL genes qepA (3.1%) and aac(6′)lb-cr (3.1%). The _E. coli_ strains isolated from irrigation water were significantly associated with resistance to aztreonam, cefuroxime, amikacin, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. Irrigation water, packing workers' hands, and discarded melons showed a higher prevalence of antibiotic-resistant, ESBL, and non-ESBL genes of _E. coli_ strains in a farm and packing facility of Honeydew melon in Hermosillo, Sonora.

[_Escherichia coli_, as the predominant aerobic Gram-negative bacillus in feces of humans and other animals, is used an indicator of fecal contamination. Fecal contamination of vegetables and fruits can occur during crop cultivation in soil contaminated by unsterile manure or use of contaminated irrigation, as well as during processing, distribution, marketing, or preparation. The strains of _E. coli_ may carry genes that encode antimicrobial resistance or genes that encode a variety of virulence factors, such as Shiga toxin causing hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome.

_E. coli_ has been identified in several food production systems, such as fruits, vegetables, poultry, cattle, pigs, and fish (see alsos below). Ingestion of food contaminated with antimicrobial-resistant _E. coli_ can result in the transfer of genes encoding antibiotic resistance to _E. coli_ that colonize the human intestinal tract. This transference of antimicrobial resistance genes can occur without the consumer of the contaminated food having been exposed to the antibiotic. The consumer can then act as a carrier or reservoir for the antimicrobial resistance genes that can eventually spread to human pathogens.

This study determines in a particular region (a local Honeydew melon farm in Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico, in 2021) the antibiotic resistance profiles and the distribution of _E. coli_ strains isolated from irrigation water, soil, farmers' hands, harvested melons, washing water, washed melons, packing tables' surfaces, packers' hands, cardboard packing boxes, and low-quality/damaged discarded melons. Irrigation water, packing workers' hands, and discarded melon showed a higher prevalence of antibiotic-resistant, extended-beta-lactamase (ESBL) genes in the Honeydew melon farm and packing facility. These strains showed resistance against ertapenem, meropenem, ampicillin, cefotaxime, and cefepime.

In addition to environmental contamination from human waste and animal farming use, the journal article brings up the concern over the inappropriate use of antibiotics in crop agriculture. - Mod.ML
