More than 700 people aboard a trans-Atlantic cruise have fallen ill with
flu-like symptoms, cruise line officials said. The outbreak, thought to be
[caused by] a norovirus, struck people aboard the Carnival Cruise Lines'
Liberty, according to a statement issued by the Miami company. The ship
left Rome on Fri 3 Nov 2006 with about 2800 paying passengers and more than
1150 crew members. The boat is due in Ft. Lauderdale on Sun 19 Nov 2006.
"Within 24 hours of sailing, they had a lot of people sick. It has tapered
off considerably over the past couple days," said David Forney of the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. The U.S. agency flew
2 medical epidemiologists and an environmental health officer to the
Caribbean island of St. Maarten, where the ship was in port on Thu 16 Nov 2006.
Noroviruses affect 23 million Americans annually, according to the CDC. A
dozen incidents of the illness have been reported on cruise ships so far in
2006. Spokeswoman Jennifer de la Cruz said Carnival hasn't nailed down the
outbreak's origin, though she noted 2 passengers acknowledged getting sick
in Rome prior to boarding. "We really ratcheted up cleaning and sanitation
to prevent the spread by common surfaces," de la Cruz said. Still, the
closed environment of a cruise ship is ripe for the spread of such infections.

[Noroviruses are enteric viruses present in the stool or vomit of infected
people, and cause severe diarrhea, nausea and vomiting (sometimes called
"winter-vomiting disease"). These viruses take their name from the town of
Norwalk where a notable outbreak occurred. The virus can be spread through
the air. Most people recover with no lasting side effects. Severe
dehydration can be a problem, especially for the very young, the very old
and people with weakened immune systems. Prevention of transmission is best
achieved by thorough hand-washing, and rubbing hands for at least 24
seconds with soap and warm water, is the best way to prevent the spread,
especially after using the bathroom or [before] preparing food.
Epidemics occur frequently during winter months in situations where people
from diverse backgrounds congregate in close proximity such as on board
cruise ships. This particular outbreak is significant on account of its
extent and duration.- Mod.CP]
