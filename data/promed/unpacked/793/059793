Dr. John Carroll has sent this email and allowed it to be posted here [in Crofsblogs]:

"Yesterday [9 May 2014], I visited an orphanage in Port-au-Prince where we adopted our boy a few years ago.

There are currently 97 children in the orphanage. During the last 7-10 days, 24 of the kids and 5 of the adult staff have come down with a febrile illness. With their fevers, they have headaches, joint pain, and chest pain, and general malaise.

I examined a number of these kids yesterday [9 May 2014] and from a clinical standpoint, they have signs and symptoms consistent with chikungunya [virus infections]. I could find no focus of infection on any of them, i.e. no pharyngitis, enlarged nodes, pulmonary rales, etc.

We have no lab tests to prove or disprove chikungunya [virus infections]. (And to be honest, if I would have examined this same group of kids a month ago, chikungunya would never have made my list on the differential.)

[The outbreak in Haiti appears to be intensifying and spreading. The 12 May 2014 edition of the Haiti Press Network (http://www.hpnhaiti.com/site/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=12700:haiti-sante-des-cas-de-chikungunya-diagnostique-dans-le-sud&catid=8:societe&Itemid=14 [in French]) stated that of the 60 cases of chikungunya virus infection diagnosed or identified, 10 specimens were transferred to the National Laboratory for extensive testing. Laboratory tests have shown that more than 7 cases are due to infection with chikungunya virus, while several others are still under investigation.

ProMED thanks David Haman (<david.hawman@ucdenver.edu>) for submitting a similar report.

The Trinidad-based Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA) has confirmed 12 new cases of the mosquito-borne virus chikungunya [infection] in St Vincent and the Grenadines, as health authorities said they were stepping up efforts to eradicate the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito. The Ministry of Health on Friday [2 May 2014] said that all the cases to date are on the Grenadine island of Bequia.

Chikungunya is a viral disease transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito resulting in fever and severe joint pain. Other symptoms include muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue, and rash. Persons experiencing such signs and symptoms are strongly advised to establish contact with their health care provider, the Ministry of Health said.

The head of the CARPHA, Dr James Hospedales, has said the chikungunya virus has reached epidemic proportions in the Caribbean. "By definition, this is an epidemic, since it represents an unusual number of cases of this problem where we would never have it before," he told the Caribbean Media Corporation (CMC).

The Ministry of Heath here said that the Insect Vector Control Unit would continue intensified vector control activities, including fogging operations on Bequia.

"Professionals within the Ministry will continue to participate in interactive programmes on radio stations and conduct educational sessions in various communities on the mainland and also on the Grenadine islands to build awareness of the threat of the disease and how it can be controlled and prevented," Luis de Shong, permanent secretary in the Ministry of Health said.

The Ministry of Health says 3 more cases of chikungunya fever have been confirmed in Antigua & Barbuda by the Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA). This brings the number of confirmed cases in the country to 4 as of yesterday [8 May 2014].

The chikungunya virus is transmitted to people by mosquitoes. The most common symptoms of chikungunya virus infection are fever and joint pain. Other symptoms may include headache, muscle pain, joint swelling, or rash.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says there is no vaccine to prevent or medicine to treat chikungunya virus infection.

The Ministry of Health issued a release, which advised that "since the virus is new to Antigua, persons would have limited immunity to the disease, and since the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito -- the vector that transmits the disease [virus] -- is present here, the number of cases is expected to increase."

The statement added: "Persons are, therefore, asked to take measures to avoid mosquito bites and to be aware of the symptoms that may include a high fever of sudden onset, severe joint pain, and a rash."

Health authorities are confirming increased cases of the mosquito-borne virus, chikungunya but say it is not confined to a particular geographical area.

The Island's Chief Medical Officer says there are now 5 confirmed cases of the virus, and the Environmental Health department is taking measures to reduce its spread. There are 25 suspected in addition to the 5 confirmed cases. The distribution of cases on the island is widespread, with 2 confirmed cases in the north and 2 in the south.

At the beginning of April [2014], the Secretariat of Health received an alert from the government of French Guiana about a new virus [chikungunya] that is more aggressive than that which causes dengue and has hit some victims in this French department.

[Arrival of] this new virus is imminent in various areas of Brazil, mainly in the states bordering the Caribbean where the virus's [geographic range] is expanding. This reality hit Amapa and Roraima states, which are now receiving redoubled attention by the Ministry of Health due to cases found in the Guiana Plateau and Venezuela [The accuracy of cases in Venezuela is questioned, since no cases have been reported there thus far. Mod.TY].

Up until now, the confirmed cases in Brazil were brought in by people who were outside the country. Because of this, the Ministry of Health is extremely concerned about the entry of this new virus from the countries on the northern border of Brazil.

This concern has increased now with the coming of the FIFA World Cup games, when the country will receive a large number of tourists coming from a wide variety of points around the world who could bring new cases of the disease.

[Concern about the risk of introduction of chikungunya virus into Brazil given the upcoming influx of travelers for the FIFA World Cup is serious. The populations of vector mosquitoes in Brazil are adequate to permit ongoing transmission of the virus. Intensification of surveillance by public health authorities in the states bordering French Guiana is prudent. With the arrival of tens of thousand of individuals in various cities in Brazil for the World Cup games, surveillance will become a very major challenge.
