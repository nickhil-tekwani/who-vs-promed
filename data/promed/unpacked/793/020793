Ituri: more than 100 cows died of FMD in Tchomia
------------------------------------------------
A hundred cows have died [during the past] month of foot and mouth
disease (FMD) in Tchomia, more than 60 km [37 miles] north of Bunia,
on Lake Albert in Ituri district. The farmers say that they lack the
vaccine to fight against the spread of this disease.

The veterinary inspector of the district said that steps are underway
to find vaccines. According to the president of the cooperative
association of farmers in Ituri (ACOPELI), the cooperative has already
placed the order for drugs to treat 1000 animals. More than 5000 cows
are already affected by this disease in the plain of Tchomia,
radiookapi.net reported.

[Congo reported in 2005 FMD serotypes SAT1, 2, & 3. 13 outbreaks were
reported during 2006 (no serotypes notified). No cases were reported
in 2007; during 2008, the disease was "suspected but not confirmed."

Confirmation, or otherwise, of the current suspected cases in Tchomia,
as well as the serotype involved, is requested.

Bunia is located in North East Congo, west of Lake Albert which is
divided between Congo and Uganda. Numerous FMD outbreaks have been
reported from neighbouring Uganda during 2008 and the 1st months of
2009. Bunia's location can be seen on the map at
