I note with interest the reply to the request for more information on the
recent study in which spongiform encephalopathy changes were noted in the
brains of market swine, despite the absence of any outward signs of
clinical neurological disease. This is indeed really, really important
because it has implications for the well-established knowledge about BSE
that has had pragmatic value in driving the eradication of this disease
from the world.
Further and more accessible information on the USDA project on
transplanting swine organs to people and the possibility of TSE disease
would be very welcome. [The web sites on the USDA research were provided in
the previous post. Readers are encouraged to look into new research on
their own. - Mod.TG]
In the meantime, a reminder may be worthwhile about established facts in
the epidemiology of BSE that make it both possible and feasible to
eradicate the disease and the causative agent. These established facts are:
1. The consumption by cattle of cattle derived by-products such as meat and
bone meal (MBM) that contain the causative agent is the only means of
transmission of BSE. The accumulated evidence on this point from field
observation and experimentation is virtually indisputable.
2. When the persistent and habitual re-feeding of cattle tissues back to
cattle ceases, transmission of the disease ceases. Feed bans are the
critical control point for BSE, as they block the potential transmission of
hypothetical sporadic BSE to other cattle. [Most feed bans are mammalian to
cattle, not just banning cattle by-products being fed to cattle. - Mod.TG]
3. Clinical cases of BSE may still appear after a ban on the feeding of MBM
and because of the long incubation period for the disease. These cases will
only occur in animals exposed to contaminated feed. [but this does not
explain calves born long enough after the ban that one cannot make the
argument that the dam was fed contaminated feed. - Mod.TG]
4. Clinical cases of BSE will no longer be seen once the generation of
animals exposed to the disease agent has died. Observations show that the
age cohort remaining 16 years after stoppage of the persistent and habitual
re-feeding of cattle tissues back to cattle has a disease prevalence of zero.
5. The disease agent is not perpetuated in the environment and is
degradable. [Although the prion can be degraded at extremely high
temperatures and more easily in alkaline conditions, it has not been proven
to be degraded in the environment. - Mod.TG]
6. Amalgamated results of surveillance make the possibility of sporadic BSE
extremely remote. The hypothesis that sporadic disease is a class property
of the TSEs that applies to cattle is well on the way to being disproved.
7. Surveillance for disease in cattle is not a control measure in itself
but serves to accredit the impact of true control measures, which are
exclusion of the disease and its agent from an area and bans on feeding
cattle tissues back to cattle.

An astounding aspect of "downer" cows is the fact that this condition or
group of conditions has been around for a long time, yet I can find no
report of downer cow brain pathology. Surely it is time for a comprehensive
study of the condition so that it can be properly defined
clinicopathologically. No relaxation of current prohibitions should occur
until we know more about downer cows.

[I am unaware of any research of this type going on. Unless there is
further notice regarding the change of policy of the US, this thread is
cut. - Mod.TG]
