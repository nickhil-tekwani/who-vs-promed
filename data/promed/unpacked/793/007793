[The above official notification confirms the outbreaks reported as suspected in posting 20140410.2396190.

While HPAI H5N1 is known to be circulating in China, another HPAI serotype, namely H5N8, has been reportedly recently circulating in another neighbour of North Korea, namely South Korea. The submission of the isolate to an international reference laboratory for confirmation of the serology and for genotyping deserves consideration.
