The Sangguniang Panlungsod [provincial legislature] has declared a dengue
outbreak in this city after its dengue hemorrhagic fever cases reached 444,
with 5 deaths. Last week, the Sangguniang Panlalawigan, in its special
session, approved a resolution declaring a state of calamity in Capiz and
its component city, Roxas City, because of the high [number of] dengue
cases in the province. Mayor Angel Alan Celino requested the City Council
to conduct a special session Saturday morning [7 Aug 2010] to declare a
dengue outbreak.

The local legislators here had declared last Tuesday [3 Aug 2010] a dengue
outbreak in 5 barangays [neighborhood political units] of this
municipality. The declaration is the offshoot of the rising dengue cases
within a span of 21 days that alarmed health authorities and municipal
officials to act before it affects the other barangays. Recently, the
Ifugao Provincial Health Office (IPHO) has confirmed the outbreak of 75
cases of dengue in barangay of Cudog and the 4 clustered barangays of
Poblacion, Lagawe in the month of July alone.

Mayor Ceasario Cabbigat stressed that concerted efforts between and among
local government units and the public are needed to combat and mitigate the
mosquitoborne disease. The MDB will spearhead the information advocacy on
dengue in all barangays, schools, and the general public to create
awareness among the populace about the dreaded disease. It will also plan
and implement programs on dengue fever and lead the search and destroy
activity of the brigade such as clean-up drives and destruction of mosquito
breeding sites.

Dr Nguyen Dac Tho, vice director of the [Ho Chi Minh City Preventive
Medicine] center, said most city districts, including districts 1 and 3,
had recorded significant increases in the incidence of the mosquitoborne
disease in July [2010] over June [2010]. On average, the increase was at
least double the June [2010] figures, but some districts have recorded 3 to
4 times the number of cases, Tho said.

"The increase in dengue fever cases showed that districts have not
controlled the epidemic properly," Le Truong Giang, vice director of the
city's Department of Health told the meeting.

The city's neighboring provinces like Binh Phuoc have also reported
increases in dengue fever, with 700 cases, including 2 deaths, so far this
year [2010]. To Duc Sinh, director of the provincial Center of Preventive
Health, said at the moment more than 100 people are being hospitalized with
dengue fever every day.

In Dong Nai Province to the north east of HCMC, more than 1000 people have
been afflicted dengue fever so far this year [2010], and 3 have died.

dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) in the whole country
compared with the same period in 2009, local media have reported increases
in cases of DF/DHF in many provinces, especially in southern, central and
highland central provinces (see prior PRO/MBDS posting: Dengue - Viet Nam

The number of fatalities due to dengue fever continues to increase with 67
deaths recorded since January this year [2010] until yesterday [6 Aug
2010], from 67 deaths during the corresponding period last year [2009].

Health minister Datuk Seri Liow Tiong Lai said a total of 29 255 cases of
dengue fever had been reported during the period this year compared with 27
989 cases last year. "The increase of 38.8 per cent in deaths due to dengue
fever and 4.5 per cent increase in cases of dengue fever is worrying. It is
a serious threat and should be given attention to by the public," he told
reporters. [Paragraph 1 shows numbers of deaths to be identical in 2009 and
2010. There's a mistake somewhere. - Mod.SH]

Liow advised the public to take necessary measures, like ensuring the
cleanliness of their surroundings, to prevent the spread of dengue. "I have
instructed my officers to step up enforcement against those responsible for
breeding of the _Aedes_ mosquitoes," he added.

endemic in India, one can not determine if this report is of a focal
outbreak or sporadic, scattered cases, although mention is made of
increased risk during the monsoon season.

The Florida Department of Health confirmed an increase in the number of
cases of dengue fever acquired in the Key West area. New statistics from
the department said 24 cases of dengue fever have been reported in Key West
through mid-July [2010], 18 of them Key West residents, 5 residents of
other Florida counties, and one a resident of another state.

In addition, 49 so-called "imported" cases of dengue fever are reported in
Florida. Those cases involved people who had traveled to areas under a
dengue endemic, such as the Caribbean or Central and South America. The
last time there was a dengue outbreak in Florida was 1934.

"We are concerned that if dengue gains a foothold in Key West, it will
travel to other Southern cities ... like Miami," said Harold Margolis,
chief of the dengue branch of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in a press release in July [2010]. There have been a few
confirmed cases along the Texas-Mexico border in recent years.

The number of "clinically suggestive" cases of dengue fever rose sharply
from 1900 patients in mid-July [2010] to 2600 between 19 Jul and 1 Aug
[2010], according to the latest epidemiological report of the Institut de
Veille Sanitaire (InVS), published on Fri 6 Aug [2010]. The experts of the
InVS also reported a sharp rise in the monthly number of cases treated in
hospital. 172 patients were hospitalized in July, compared with 87 in June.

In total, more than 310 patients have been hospitalized for "biologically
[laboratory] confirmed" dengue fever, including 9 deaths since the
beginning of the dengue epidemic in February [2010].

Note the number of cases clinically suggestive is estimated from the number
of patients who consulted a general practitioner for a clinical syndrome
suggestive of dengue fever for the whole population of Martinique.

Jamaica recorded 77 laboratory-confirmed dengue cases up to 24 Jul [2010],
as the virus continued its march across Central American and Caribbean
countries. Health minister Rudyard Spencer told journalists at a press
briefing at Jamaica House in Kingston yesterday [3 Aug 2010] that of the 77
cases, 7 have been confirmed to be the more severe form of the illness --
DHF. Spencer, however, said no cases of dengue shock syndrome have been
reported so far nor any related deaths.

Fogging is being carried out in about 800 communities across the island.
The minister said the ministry will also be launching a comprehensive
public education programme to alert people to the dangers of and
preventative actions on dengue. He said a community youth dengue prevention
intervention programme has also been developed, under which it is proposed
that 1200 young people receive training to go into about 150 high-risk
communities to provide house-to-house dengue prevention information and
identify and destroy breeding sites.

Meanwhile, the chief medical officer, Dr Sheila Campbell Forrester has
assured that the health team is equipped to manage cases of dengue fever
and is on high alert for signs and symptoms of the illness.

During the past 2 weeks, 10 more Hondurans died of DHF, bringing to 43 the
number of people killed by the disease this year in the Central American
country, authorities said on Friday [7 Aug 2010].

This year's dengue outbreak has been the deadliest in the nation's history,
health minister Arturo Bendana told reporters. Sources in Honduras' medical
community say the actual death toll from dengue fever could be even higher,
as some private hospitals are slow in reporting fatality data to the Health
Ministry.

Honduras has seen 1025 cases of DHF and 33 628 cases of non-lethal classic
dengue so far in 2010, according to Health Ministry figures. A dozen
Hondurans died of hemorrhagic dengue fever in all of 2009.

"Regrettably, dengue goes on causing deaths in the country, despite the
campaign to combat the mosquito that transmits the illness," Bendana said,
though noting the number of new dengue patients admitted to public
hospitals has declined in recent weeks.

The Ministry of Health of Costa Rica is on alert for the presence of
"dengue [virus] 4", the only type of dengue not circulating in the country,
but which has been found in Nicaragua and Honduras. The alarm of the
authorities of Costa Rica was made through the Pan American Health
Organization (PAHO, linked to the United Nations).

According to the latest report of the Ministry of Health on dengue, since
the beginning of the year until 26 Jul [2010], there have been 15 916
people who have suffered the disease. This figure represents an increase of
603 per cent in comparison with the same period last year [2009].

Trejo said the best way to prevent the development of dengue 4 is to
eliminate potential mosquito breeding sites. She added that "among the
countries of Central America there is a great movement of people, and if
Costa Rica does not take steps (to stop dengue 4 from entering), there will
be serious problems."
