Four lots of Brilliant Blue G (BBG) ophthalmic solution that were dispensed from a pharmacy in Florida directly to ophthalmologists have been recalled because of reports of fungal endophthalmitis associated with the use of BBG in vitrectomy.

The FDA on 16 Mar 2012 issued a safety alert from MedWatch, the FDA's safety information and adverse event reporting program. According to the alert, the affected lot numbers are 08232011@80, 10132011@6, 10112011@82, and 10192011@125.

The pharmacy dispensing the solution, Franck's Compounding, located in Ocala, FL, stated that they notified 22 physicians who received BBG from a batch made in August 2011 and began an immediate recall, and then subsequently recalled supplies from an additional 78 physicians.

According to the pharmacy, _Fusarium_ was cultured from select unused vials returned by physicians, although the source of the _Fusarium_ has not been determined. According to the company, all of the remaining BBG from the August 2011 batch is accounted for and is no longer being used on patients.

The pharmacy suggests that healthcare practitioners adhere to pharmacy guidelines, use "single-use" vials as directed, and record patient, procedure, site, product lot, and product expiration date when using this product.

Audience: Ophthalmology, Risk Manager

Issue: FDA has received reports of fungal endophthalmitis (eye infections) in patients who were given Brilliant Blue G (BBG), supplied by Franck's Pharmacy, during eye surgeries. Clinicians in several states reported the adverse events. FDA, along with CDC and local and state public health agencies, are actively investigating these adverse events.

Background: the BBG was supplied by Franck's Compounding Lab, Ocala, Florida. Franck's Pharmacy issued a recall on 9 Mar 2012, of all lots of Brilliant Blue G and issued a recall letter. Brilliant Blue G is not an approved drug in the USA.

Recommendation: immediately quarantine and return any remaining Brilliant Blue G product from Franck's Compounding Lab. This includes all lots of Brilliant Blue G received from Franck's.

FDA requests that practitioners report to MedWatch any cases of endophthalmitis, fungal or bacterial, that occurred within the last 6 months, associated with eye surgery in which Brilliant Blue G from any source was used.

Healthcare professionals and patients are encouraged to report adverse events or side effects related to the use of these products to the FDA's MedWatch Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program:

Complete and submit the report online: http://www.fda.gov/MedWatch/report.htm or call 1-800-332-1088 to request a reporting form, then complete and return to the address on the pre-addressed form, or submit by fax to 1-800-FDA-0178.

[Protein staining dyes can be used for intraoperative staining of the inner limiting membrane during vitrectomy for macular hole surgery. A macular hole is a small break in the macula, located in the center of the retina of the eye. In one study (Shukla D, Kalliath J, Neelakantan N, Naresh KB, Ramasamy K: A comparison of brilliant blue G, trypan blue, and indocyanine green dyes to assist internal limiting membrane peeling during macular hole surgery. Retina 2011; 31(10): 2021-5; abstract available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21685824), brilliant blue G was comparable with trypan blue in optimizing visual and functional outcomes, while it was similar to indocyanine green in ease of internal limiting membrane peeling.

Fungal endophthalmitis is infrequent but usually causes poor visual outcomes. It can be exogenous or endogenous depending upon the mode of infection. The common causes for endogenous, post-traumatic, post-surgical, and those secondary to keratitis are _Candida albicans_, _Aspergillus niger_, and _Fusarium solani_, respectively. Clinical features depend on the virulence of the organism and the mode of infection. Broad-spectrum systemic antifungal therapy with or without intravitreal antifungal drugs is recommended. The prognosis depends upon the virulence of the organism, extent of intraocular involvement and the timing of interventions. Prompt therapy following early diagnosis helps to reduce significant visual loss.

It should be noted that Brilliant Blue G is not an approved drug in the USA as stated in the FDA posting. - Mod.LL
