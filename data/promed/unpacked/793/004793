Re: PRO/AH/EDR> Avian influenza (126): Germany (Thuringia), Viet Nam
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Further to the question relating to vaccination in Viet Nam as
referred to in the ProMED-mail post below (archive No.
20070709.2185), I offer the following comments.

The only reason one would insist on using an antigen containing a
heterologous neuraminidase is if serological DIVA [differentiating
infected from vaccinated individuals] testing was being used.

At this point in the avian influenza (AI) control program in Viet Nam
the overall objective is to reduce the levels of infection, and
vaccination is one of the measures being used to achieve this. There
are some 8 million households rearing poultry in Viet Nam and it is
not possible to test all flocks of poultry before they go to market.
Therefore, routine DIVA testing is not an option (nor was routine
pre-market testing of poultry for infection possible before
vaccination was used -- and we know that some infected unprotected
flocks were sent to market by farmers).

The antigen in the vaccine used in Viet Nam (containing the HA and NA
from Goose/Guangdong/96) was chosen because it has been shown to
provide long lasting immunity against currently circulating viruses
and was a closer match to these viruses than the H5N2 antigen that
was used in chickens in Viet Nam in the 1st rounds of vaccination. It
also produces much better levels of protection in ducks than other
vaccines tested.

Over time, as the control program moves from one of containment to
one of elimination, it may be reasonable to switch to a vaccine that
allows for DIVA testing, provided the heterologous antigen still
affords the same level of protection as the current antigen, and DIVA
testing is demonstrated to be of benefit under Asian conditions with
HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza) viruses. (Readers may be
surprised to learn that there have been few if any formal field
studies on the use of DIVA testing in vaccinated flocks against H5N1
HPAI despite the widespread promotion of this method; DIVA studies so
far have been in flocks with LPAI (low pathogenic avian influenza) infections).

In addition, there are other means of detecting infection (which have
been used in Viet Nam and elsewhere) that provide information on
circulation of H5N1 viruses. These include investigations of
outbreaks of disease, testing of unvaccinated ducks, use of
sentinels, market testing for virus circulation, and testing of
routine dead birds in flocks. Serological DIVA testing is also
complicated in Asia by the circulation of other low pathogenicity AI
viruses. As a serological test, it also provides limited information
on the infection status of the flock at the time of sale; there is at
least a 17-day lag period between initial infection of a flock and
detection of infection through DIVA testing (7 days for the virus to
spread sufficiently in the flock and another 10 days for seroconversion).

Finally, some questions have been raised suggesting that the recent
cases of HPAI in ducks demonstrate that the vaccination campaign in
Viet Nam is not working. The vast majority of these cases has
occurred in unvaccinated ducks and show that this is not due to
failure of vaccination but rather failure to vaccinate. This issue of
non-vaccination is being addressed at present.

[2] Viet Nam (Dien Bien, Ca Mau)

Bird flu has hit 2 more Vietnamese provinces, while several
localities nationwide have met criteria for announcing an end to bird
flu outbreaks in their territory, according to a local veterinary
agency on Wednesday [11 Jul 2007].

The disease, since [5 Jul 2007], killed about 500 ducks raised by 6
households in northern Dien Bien province's Dien Bien district, the
Department of Animal Health under the country's Ministry of
Agriculture and Rural Development said, noting that specimens from
the affected poultry have tested positive for the bird flu virus strain H5N1.

On [2 Jul 2007], bird flu was also found in a flock of 14 ducks
raised by a household in southern Ca Mau province's Dam Doi district,
with 9 ducks affected and 5 dead, said the department, adding that
the provincial veterinary bureau has slaughtered all fowls in the
affected flock.

Bird flu, which 1st struck Viet Nam in December 2003, has hit 20
Vietnamese cities and provinces since early May [2007].

To prevent the spread of the disease, the Vietnamese government has
called for more efforts in the fight against bird flu, mainly by
strengthening bird flu vaccination among poultry and tightening
management over poultry egg hatcheries.

So far this year [2007], the country has vaccinated 154.3 million
fowls, including 85.6 million chickens, 65.11 million ducks, and 3.59
million white-winged ducks, said the department.

[In another newswire submitted by ProMED-mail Rapportuer Mary
Marshall, more information on the outbreak in Dien Bien was provided:

"From [5-10 Jul 2007], the Dien Bien Veterinary Department detected 6
farmer families in 3 communes of Thanh Yen, Thanh Hung and Thanh
Xuong in Dien Bien District, had around 500 of the total 2400 ducks
died. All of the ducks are 25 days old and were not vaccinated
yet. The testing results show that they are positive to H5N1 virus.
The local Bird Flu Control Board on [10 Jul 2007] culled all fowl
flocks in the 2 communes of Thanh Xuong and Thanh Hung." (available

[Dien Bien is a new province in Northern Viet Nam, which was created
by a split of the former Lai Chau Province. Ca Mau Province is
located at the southernmost extremity of the country. A map of Viet

[3] Czech Republic: poultry, 2 new outbreaks

Czechs confirm H5N1 bird flu at 2 more farms
--------------------------------------------
Tests confirmed the H5N1 type of the bird flu virus in poultry at 2
farms in the eastern Czech Republic, the State Veterinary Authority
(SVS) said on Thursday [12 Jul 2007]. The virus was found at the 2
farms with 71 000 poultry, bringing the number of outbreaks in Czech
farms to 4.

Vets were preparing to cull all birds on the farms on Thursday [12
Jul 2007], spokesman Josef Duben said. "It was H5N1, we had expected
that and taken standard protective measures," he added.

The Czechs identified their 1st bird flu case, which involved the
lethal H5N1 strain, at a turkey farm in the eastern part of the
country in June [2007].

The 2 farms where disease was reported on Wednesday [11 Jul 2007],
are within a 3-km (1.9-mi) protective zone around another farm where
H5N1 had been found. Vets have extended the standard 3-km protection
zone and 10-km 96.2 mi) surveillance zone to include the 2 farms.

More than 30 countries have reported bird flu outbreaks in the past
year, mostly in wild birds.

Since late June [2007], Germany has reported the H5N1 virus in dozens
of wild birds and in a pet goose.

Globally, H5N1 has killed nearly 200 people out of more than 300
known cases, according to the World Health Organisation. None of the
victims were from Europe.
