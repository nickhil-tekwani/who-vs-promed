A celery recall prompted by an _E. coli_ O157 scare that sickened 19 people in 7 states has now expanded to 18 states and includes more than 155 000 products pulled from shelves at major grocery chains.

On 26 Nov 2015, the Food and Drug Administration announced that California company Taylor Farms Pacific was voluntarily recalling a number of celery products which were used in prepared foods including Costco's rotisserie chicken salad. A sample of the celery tested positive for _E. coli_, and 19 people in California, Colorado, Missouri, Montana, Utah, Virginia and Washington were sickened from eating it. 5 of those patients were hospitalized and 2 developed kidney failure, but no deaths were reported, CBS News reported. Costco pulled the salad from all USA stores.

Since then, several other major retailers and grocery chains have also pulled products with Taylor Farms celery from shelves, including Walmart, Sam's Club, Costco, Albertsons, 7-Eleven, Target and Safeway. Recalled items included pre-made sandwiches, salads and vegetable mixes. Starbucks also removed holiday turkey & stuffing paninis.

The recalls vary by store and state, but so far Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington and Wyoming have all been affected. No recalls, except for the nationwide Costco chicken salad recall, have affected New York. A full list of recalled items by store and state can be found on the FDA website.

ABC News reports that the _E. coli_ O157 outbreak is likely to grow over the next few weeks, despite the recall.

Earlier in 2015, an outbreak of _Escherichia coli_ O157 in Minnesota had been linked to celery grown in Gonzales, CA (E. coli EHEC - USA (30): (MN) O157 (CA) celery 20141116.2959790). Contamination of fresh produce with EHEC or potential enteric pathogens can occur while the produce is growing in the fields, during harvesting, during storage or during preparation.

Aggressive washing of the contaminated product will not necessarily prevent infection as internalization of bacteria by the produce can occur:
Deering AJ, Mauer LJ, Pruitt RE: Internalization of E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella spp. in plants: A review. Food Res Int 2012; 45: 567-75

Abstract:
"Extensive research efforts have been devoted in the last decade to providing insight into understanding the factors that have contributed to the increase in the number of outbreaks of Salmonella spp. and E. coli O157:H7 involving fresh produce, including leafy greens, fruits, and nuts. Many studies have shown that both Salmonella spp. and E. coli O157:H7 can internalize within a variety of tissue types and that there are numerous factors that can influence the extent of internalization. In this review, a compilation of the studies that have been performed to examine internalization, as well as various techniques that have been developed to identify the plant organs and tissues that harbor internalized bacteria are presented. In addition, the various routes of internalization into the plant, survival following internalization, and interactions between internalized bacteria and the plant as well as associated microbes are also addressed."bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb - Mod.LL
