According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, 5 people have become ill with _E. coli_ after visiting Grant's Farm since late May 2019, the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services said Fri 21 Jun 2019. The DHSS, along with the state and federal departments of agriculture and St. Louis area health agencies, are investigating what specifically led to the Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_, or enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ EHEC.

Shiga toxin is harmful to humans. Symptoms can begin one to 10 days after exposure and can include severe stomach cramps, bloody diarrhea, vomiting and sometimes a low fever. Most people get better in about a week, according to the DHSS, but some infections can be severe or even life-threatening.

Grant's Farm is participating in the investigation and is allowing investigators to take samples from the animals. Grant's Farm already takes part in routine visits from state inspectors that provide oversight for the health of all the animals in the park, according to a DHSS statement.

While the investigation is taking place, the health department's preliminary recommendation to Grant's Farm is to remind patrons of the importance of washing their hands after having direct contact with animals.

"At Grant's Farm, the safety of our patrons, our employees, and our animal population is our highest priority," a Grant's Farm official said in a statement. "Out of an abundance of caution, we will also be taking further safety measures, including the addition of several more hand-washing/antibacterial stations, and increased signage to remind our visitors of the importance of proper hygiene after coming into contact with the animals."

Five to 10% of those infected with EHEC can develop a serious kidney condition called hemolytic uremic syndrome, which requires hospitalization and can be fatal. Antibiotic treatment of EHEC might increase a person's risk for developing the syndrome and is not recommended, according to the DHSS.
