First Report of Grapevine "Bois Noir" Disease and a New Phytoplasma
Infecting Solanaceous Plants in Lebanon.

During a 2001 survey to evaluate the incidence of phytoplasma diseases in
Lebanon, samples were collected from plants showing symptoms suggestive of
phytoplasmal infections [and those from]...symptomless plants.
Sample[s] ... from the Bekaa Valley included: 3 ... of tomato
(_Lycopersicum esculentum_), 4 ... of pepper (_Capsicum annuum_), 10 ... of
grapevine (_Vitis vinifera_) cvs. Chardonnay and Alicante Bouschet; 7 of
... ornamental periwinkle (_Catharantus roseus_) from the Tyr area; and 4
samples of weeds (_Lactucca serratia_). DNA was extracted from leaf
midveins of diseased and symptomless plants, and from healthy periwinkle,
grapevine, tomato, and pepper plants grown in a greenhouse in France.
... PCR with universal primers for the amplification of phytoplasma
ribosomal RNA genes (3) only produced a 1.8-kbp rDNA fragment from
symptomatic samples. The amplified DNAs were analyzed by ... RFLP with
several restriction enzymes and sequenced. The analysis showed extracts of
diseased grapevines, and 2 periwinkle plants had identical rDNA sequences
and restriction profiles of the stolbur cluster (4).
The sequences had 98 percent identity with 2 European stolbur isolates from
grapevine and periwinkle (GenBank Accession Nos. X76428 and AF248959,
respectively). In grapevine, the disease induced by the stolbur phytoplasma
is "bois noir." Bois noir is present in Europe, where its incidence is
predominant in northern vineyards and has been reported in Israel (2).
In tomato and pepper, the restriction profiles and sequences of the
phytoplasma rDNAs were identical, [indicating] ... that the phytoplasma
belonged to the clover proliferation (CP) cluster, as does the eggplant
little leaf phytoplasma of solanaceous plants in Asia. They differed from
the stolbur phytoplasma, known to infect solanaceaous plants in Europe.
... A phytoplasma belonging to the pigeon pea witches' broom (PPWB) cluster
was found in _L. serratia_ and in some periwinkle plants. [Recently] a
phytoplasma of the PPWB cluster was ... shown to be responsible for an
emerging lethal disease of almond trees in Lebanon (1).
To our knowledge, this is the first report of the stolbur/bois noir disease
in Lebanon.
