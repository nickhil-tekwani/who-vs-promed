A 2-year-old girl has become the 12th person to die of bird flu [avian (H5N1) influenza virus infection] in Cambodia this year [2013]. Cambodia's Health Ministry and the World Health Organization said in a joint statement Monday [4 Nov 2013] -- http://www.cdcmoh.gov.kh/PressRelease/44_Press_release_Eng.pdf -- that the girl died from the H5N1 bird flu virus on 26 Oct 2013 after suffering from fever, difficulty in breathing and lethargy.

The statement said an investigation at the girl's village in western Pursat province revealed that 2 months before her illness, poultry had died suddenly at her grandparents' house, where she often stayed. The H5N1 avian influenza virus normally spreads among poultry but can sometimes spread from poultry to humans.
