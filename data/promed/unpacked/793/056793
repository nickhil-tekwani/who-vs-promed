5000 babies to get vitamin B1 injections
----------------------------
Health Ministry officials on Sunday were set to order vitamin B1 injections
to some 5000 infants believed to have been fed the soy-based milk
substitute "Remedia."
Vitamin B1 (thiamine), a vital substance, was revealed in tests to be
missing from the new formula of the German-made Remedia soya milk product,
despite being listed on the packaging as an ingredient.
Babies that relied exclusively on the milk had no other source of vitamin
B1, a Health Ministry official explained. A complete lack of the vitamin
leads after a period of time to damage to the central nervous system and
the heart.
3 babies have died and 17 are hospitalized with encephalopathy. The Health
Ministry recommends that children who have drunk the milk be given vitamin
B1 supplements.
The ministry claims it was not aware that Remedia had introduced a new
formula into the Israeli market.
The formula is particularly popular among orthodox Jews, who use the
non-dairy formula alongside meat meals. Rabbis permitted loudspeakers to be
used in their neighborhoods on Shabbat [the Jewish sabbath] to warn parents
against using the formula. Announcements about the formula were also made
in synagogues. Clalit Health Services reported that over 10 000 calls were
received from worried parents whose babies drink the formula, and hundreds
of babies who seemed sick were brought to emergency rooms.
The symptoms of the condition leading to encephalopathy include apathy,
nausea, vomiting, and later convulsions and loss of consciousness.
Schneider pediatricians reported that they were surprised by the 3 cases in
one week, as they usually treat one case of encephalopathy -­ which can
have numerous causes -­ in 2 months. Suspicious, they immediately informed
the Health Ministry, which began interviewing the families for in-depth
epidemiological investigation. The babies had not been in any contact, but
all of them had been fed the non-dairy Remedia formula. While it has not
been proven that the formula had something that caused the illness, the
company was informed and told that the product would temporarily be taken
off the market.
Dr. Itamar Shalit, head of the infectious diseases unit at Schneider, said
there has so far been no sign so far of any virus, bacteria, or other
infectious agent in the babies and that it was not contagious, as no one in
the families had been infected. "This is a very rare, enigmatic
occurrence," he said. "It is not clear whether the babies have suffered any
permanent brain damage, but the brain stem has been affected, according to
magnetic resonance instrument scans. Still, it may be reversible. One child
who reached Schneider a few months ago suffered brain damage and is still
hospitalized, while another recovered completely."
Shalit said that epidemiological studies and tests would look for some
toxic or environmental cause in addition to an infectious agent. The 4
babies are attached to a respirator and receiving antibiotics and antiviral
drugs at least until a pathogen is ruled out.

At least 6 babies and infants have been recently hospitalized in Israel in
coma with the findings of encephalopathy. 2 of them have died. The cause is
unknown as yet. One of the possible culprits is a milk substitute baby
formula by the name of Remedia manufactured in Germany. The use of this
formula was discontinued by the authorities.
Thousand of parents are in panic. The product is being analyzed. One
possibility is the lack of Vitamin B1 in the actual product though it is
supposed to contain it. Other possibilities are an unidentified organism,
heavy metals, or an act of terrorism against Israel. It would be of
interest to know whether this problem has surfaced in other countries, as
this formula is extensively used in Germany and the UK, and maybe in other
countries.

[From the newswire article, it appears as though the encephalopathy is due
to a thiamine deficiency resulting from the absence of thiamine from the
infant formula. Dr. Affias raises the question of whether this problem has
surfaced in other countries. More information on the event in Israel -- as
well as information on whether this is being observed in other countries --
would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
