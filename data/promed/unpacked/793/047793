Key deer deaths slowing down
----------------------------
Finally, good news for the endangered Key deer: The number of deer found to be infected with New World screwworm on Big Pine Key and No Name Key is slowly going down, along with the number of those having to be euthanized. Kevin Lowry, chief public information officer with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at the National Key Deer Refuge, said even though the parasitic screwworm larvae have caused the deaths of 114 Key deer, none had to be euthanized Tuesday [25 Oct 2016].

He said officials are optimistic the numbers will continue to come down, preserving the Key deer population, which was estimated at about 1000 before the deaths and euthanizations of infected deer began in July [2016]. The deer, just 3 feet high, are found only in the Florida Keys and are on the Endangered Species List.

Asked about the possibility of moving some Key deer off the refuge to save them, he said translocating some could be considered in preservation efforts but nothing has been confirmed. "The main thing we want to do is keep them here and not remove them," he said. "The population could become stable here quickly. It's a very good sign to have zero deer euthanized for the latest report and it's all about making sure they remain in their native environment."

Lowry said the number is dropping due to the efforts of refuge officers and the help of 120 volunteers on Big Pine and No Name who are treating deer with doramectin, an antiparasitic medicine that serves as a preventive measure and treatment for screwworm. Initial treatments began last week. After receiving a dose of doramectin on a piece of bread, the deer are marked with nontoxic paint in a specific color for the day they're treated to tell refuge staff those deer were treated.

"We have developed neighborhood strike teams, so when the volunteers are properly trained, we're identifying neighborhoods and they're being labeled to that area," Lowry said. "Then they report to pick up supplies and materials and are charged with reporting back the number of deer they've treated."

Screwworm flies lay their eggs in open wounds where larvae hatch and feed, basically eating the deer alive. Many of the deer wounds are believed to come from rutting -- males battling each other for mates. So far, 259 females and 176 males have been treated with doramectin.

Sterile male screwworms continue to be released to mate with female flies as well, a successful method to kill the population created by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in the 1960s.

Dr. Doug Mader, veterinarian and owner of the Marathon Veterinary Hospital, said pet owners should check their pets twice a day. He has seen 2 pigs, 1 cat and 1 dog put down because of the screwworm and said owners shouldn't wait to take their animal to a veterinarian if they see signs of screwworm. As of Tuesday [25 Oct 2016], state Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services law enforcement officers have inspected 1644 animals heading out of the Keys at an inspection point at mile marker 106 in Key Largo and found no instances of the screwworm fly.

Those interested in volunteering to treat Key deer should email Kristie Killam, refuge park ranger, at keydeer@fws.gov. To report an infected deer, call (305) 470-6863, Ext. 7.

Race ramps up to save Key deer from grisly screwworm outbreak
-------------------------------------------------------------
In a Winn-Dixie strip mall just off the Overseas Highway, a storage room at the National Key Deer Refuge visitor center has become the 1st stop in an expanding campaign against a ghastly screwworm infecting the planet's last herd. This week, as the number of dead deer continued to climb, the refuge's small staff crowded the room, loading tinfoil trays with white bread slathered in orange blossom honey and injected with a potent antiparasitic. A ranger filled squirt bottles with purple paint while another packed Ziploc bags with chopped fruit to both lure and reward deer for taking the bitter medicine. Volunteers and biologists hustled in and out, grabbing rubber gloves to protect themselves from the drug as they headed out on sorties into deer habitat.

Up the road, a U.S. Department of Agriculture [USDA] command center at the airport in Marathon is undertaking something not done in the Southeastern U.S. in half a century: eradication of the New World screwworm. With the number of deer deaths reaching 114 as of Tuesday [25 Oct 2016], the entomologists, GIS experts, vets and biologists fighting the outbreak ramped up their efforts this week. The assault is simple in theory -- attack on 2 fronts by protecting the deer with a prophylactic drug and eliminating the flies with squadrons of infertile breeding partners -- but complicated in execution. Biologists say the deer are susceptible to capture myopathy, meaning they can literally die of fear, so tracking and treating them has been tricky. Such a large-scale effort has never been undertaken on the herd. And fighting screwworm across wetlands and a dense pine rockland -- the largest tract in the U.S. outside Everglades National Park -- is entirely new territory.

"It's not something we ever expected," said refuge biologist Adam Emerick, who 1st noticed bucks turning up with grisly wounds in mid September [2016] and, after wondering whether something might be amiss, collected 4 samples to test for parasites.

Over the weekend [22-23 Oct 2016], the refuge's staff trained 50 volunteers on how to lure and feed the deer -- something strictly forbidden over the years in an attempt to keep the herd wild, said park ranger Kristie Killam. So far, 335 have been treated in a herd estimated at about 1000. Monday [24 Oct 2016] also marked the 1st day since officials began documenting the outbreak that no deer were euthanized, a rare bit of good news, said U.S. Fish and Wildlife spokesman Kevin Lowry.

Entomologists have also begun releasing sterile screwworms to mate with wild flies. They plan on releasing about 2.7 million each week, produced at a Panamanian lab jointly run with the USDA.

Because the screwworms haven't appeared in the U.S. in so long, entomologists are identifying hotspots based on conditions in other counties, said Scott Peterich, a wildlife mitigation specialist with the Florida Forest Service who is pitching in to provide mapping expertise. But the mix of habitat in the Keys is proving challenging. "They say go there, but then we find out there's mangrove and water and we can't go there," Peterich said.

On Monday, Killam, Emerick and 2 other biologists searched spots favored by the deer -- an overgrown coconut farm now used to house refuge interns and still called the Nut Farm and along Key Deer Boulevard. The deer readily ate the bread after being lured with the fruit. Staffers continue to wrestle with how to reach more reclusive wild deer deeper in the refuge.

The drug, doramectin, needs to be re-administered every 7 days. For tamer deer, volunteers and staffers are marking deer they feed with a different color non-toxic paint to indicate what day they were treated. The deer don't always cooperate: On Monday [24 Oct 2016], a doe and a young buck tried to lick off the paint. They're trying to come up with a better alternative, which can be tricky in the tightly regulated refuge that also caused some locals to complain the staff reacted too slowly to the initial outbreak.

"People asked what took you so long once this was diagnosed. But we have 23 endangered species. We have to balance protection and making sure we weren't hurting other animals," Killam said. "We wanted to make sure we didn't make a bigger problem."

Comments about the event, New World screwworm (NWS) that has occurred in Florida, USA, which are based on ProMED public briefing notes on 18, 20 and 22 Oct 2016:

On 18 Oct 2016 the NWS had been detected in the following additional sites to Big Pine Key where it was detected originally: 1) No Name Keys, 2) Big Torch Key, 3) Middle Torch Key, 4) Cudjoe and 5) Ramrod.

According to information available, NWS sterile flies produced by the Panama plant, United States Commission for the Eradication and Prevention of NWS, were to be released on 11 Oct 2016 by the dispersion on land method. If the occurrence of NWS is to be quickly and efficiently contained, you need to make an effort and use the proven aerial release method of sterile flies, especially because the population most affected is wild animals and sterile flies will have a better distribution over infested areas, which does not occur by the method of land release as access of insects is limited to the availability of roads and release points selected for this purpose.

It is also recommended as a preventive measure the (creation) of biological barriers using NWS sterile flies at strategic locations in the area of the Keys and the mainland, until the occurrence in the affected areas is controlled. The current emergency demands that all human and economic resources are employed now, in order to avoid further negative health and economic impacts.

Notes on 20 and 22 Oct 2016 refer to chemical control efforts to prevent and control seizures in adult NWS in the wild deer population. This is an important control measure associated with intensive field inspection of farm animals and pets. Also the application of physical measures, such as the use of a large number of fly traps for NWS, can be useful, while a communication campaign at the local, state or national levels (providing information) on NWS control. However, it should be noted that the above control measure will help reduce the wild population and its consequences, but not the elimination of the NWS.

Proper use of the technique using sterile insects on this occasion, as in others, is the key to the successful elimination of NWS in Florida, USA.

[I apologise for probably overloading with 2 similar reports out of Florida but they provide colour and details of the doramectin response and some excellent photographs for those needing material for briefing colleagues and instructing students.

We are always glad to hear from our members and we need to. Moises provided some background on himself: "I would like to inform you that currently my present activity is as International Animal Health Expert, with frequent consultancies for OIE and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). I am a retired FAO officer, after 23 years as staff member in Animal Production and Health, 7 years based in Rome and 16 in FAO Regional Office for Latin America and the Caribbean in Santiago, Chile. Concerning to my knowledge and experience in the control and eradication of the New World screwworm (NWS) _Cochliomyia hominivorax_, I spent 16 years participating in the diagnosis, control and NWS successful elimination using the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) in USA, Mexico, Guatemala and Belize. At FAO Rome I was the technical officer responsible for the NWS eradication in Libya (1988-1991) and the Screwworm Emergency Centre for North Africa (SECNA). Currently I am the Senior Technical Consultant for the IAEA project RLA 5067 for Supporting Capability Building of Feasibility of a Progressive NWS Control in 8 South American countries."

Moises, many thanks. - Mod.MHJ
