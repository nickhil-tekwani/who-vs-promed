Citrus decline is widespread throughout Pakistan and is variously
attributed to orchard neglect, poor plant nutrition, water logging,
fungal diseases or nematodes. While these causes of decline can be
expected to affect citrus orchards in Pakistan, it is more likely
that the main cause of decline is due to a bacterial disease called
huanglongbing (HLB: also known as citrus greening) caused by the
bacterium _Candidatus_ Liberibacter asiaticus. The disease is
present in all of the countries neighbouring Pakistan, and in India
HLB has been reported to be present in all citrus-growing regions.
The presence of _Ca._ L. asiaticus in citrus orchards in the
North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan has been confirmed. Samples
of DNA extracted from leaves of putatively infected citrus plants and
from the vector of the disease, _Diaphorina citri_ (Asiatic citrus
psyllid), were subjected to analysis using PCR [polymerase chain
reaction] and produced DNA amplicons characteristic of this
bacterium. To confirm the exact nature of the pathogen, amplicons
were sequenced and the resulting data showed 100 percent identity
with published sequences of the _Ca._ L. asiaticus _rplKAJL-rpoBC_
operon.
This study is the first to provide molecular evidence for the
presence of _Ca._ L. asiaticus in Pakistan and future work will
determine the extent and occurrence of the disease as a first step
towards the overall management of HLB.

[2] Greening tops canker as most feared disease for citrus growers in the US

It used to be all about canker. Not anymore. Now there's a new
disease worse than canker to worry about. "Right now we think maybe
this is one of the worst diseases we've ever had," said Jay Clark,
president of Clark Farms in Wauchula FL and board president of Citrus
Mutual.
Florida growers recently traveled to Brazil, where they studied how
the industry there has dealt with greening, a deadly bacterial
disease with no known cure. After what they saw on the trip, they
urged other growers this past week [6-8 Jun 2007] at the Florida
Citrus Industry Annual Conference, not to look the other way on
greening.
"The message from the Brazilian growers is that greening is
different. It will take out the citrus tree and it will do it fast,"
said Peter McClure of Evans Properties, a Vero Beach-based grower. He
and Clark were among about 20 who made the weeklong trip to Brazil.
Growers in Brazil are doing a much better job of controlling the
disease, Clark said. "They found it before we did and they moved
quicker to get rid of it," he said.
Dr. Joseph Bove, a professor and director at INRA, the French
National Institute for Agricultural Research, calls the disease a
citrus grower's nightmare. He too urged growers to fight the disease.
"You can try anything," he said.
Growers are encouraged to scout their groves for the disease, to take
out infected trees and to spray for psyllids, the tiny insects that
so efficiently spread greening. "We know of no chemical that's
effective on it," Clark said. "There are no trees that are not
affected by it: no rootstock, no variety."
- The Florida Citrus Production Research Advisory Council will spend
about USD 1.6 million on research in 2007, with an emphasis on
greening and canker. The council gets its money from a 1 cent-per-box
charge collected from the state's growers.
- On the federal level, President Bush's fiscal 2008 budget includes
USD 1 million in recurring money to support a greening and canker
research lab in Fort Pierce FL.
- The industry hopes to see FL Gov. Charlie Crist approve a USD 3.75
million appropriation for greening and canker research.
- State legislators appropriated USD 250 000 to the University of
Florida/IFAS to support a greening diagnosis lab to be set up at the
Southwest Florida Research & Education Center and USD 1 million to
develop citrus varieties resistant to canker and greening.
- UF/IFAS is investing an additional USD 750 00 in research.

[Citrus greening is one of the most damaging diseases of citrus.
Symptoms include blotchy mottling and yellowing of leaves and small,
irregularly shaped fruits with a thick, pale peel and bad taste.
Affected trees become stunted, bear multiple off-season flowers and
may live for only a few years without ever bearing usable fruit.
Spread of citrus greening occurs primarily via citrus psyllids and
grafting. It is also transmissible through dodder (a parasitic vine),
and possibly by seed from infected plants and transovarially in the
vectors. The disease is restricted to _Citrus_ and close relatives
because of the narrow host range of the vectors. Disease management
requires an integrated approach including use of clean planting
stock, elimination of inoculum, use of pesticides for vector control
in orchards, and biological control of vectors in non-crop reservoirs.
The disease occurs throughout much of Asia, Africa south of the
Sahara and some parts of South America. The causal pathogens are
highly fastidious phloem-inhabiting bacteria which so far cannot be
cultured. Three different strains have been reported: _Candidatus_
Liberibacter asiaticus_, _Ca._ L. africanus (including a subsp.
capensis) and _Ca._ L. americanus recently described from Brazil. The
Asian citrus psyllid _Diaphorina citri_ is the vector for both the
Asian and the American strains. It was discovered in Florida in 1998
and _Ca._ L. asiaticus was found there in 2005. The African citrus
psyllid _Trioza erytreae_ is the vector for the African strain. Even
the psyllids on their own are a serious pest of young citrus trees.
Citrus greening has not been reported from the Mediterranean region
or Australia where it is a serious quarantine concern.
Citrus canker is caused by the bacterium _Xanthomonas axonopodis_
pathovar _citri_. Symptoms appear on fruit, leaves and branches of
infected plants. Although the taste of the fruit is not affected it
cannot be sold or processed. The disease occurs worldwide. It can be
transmitted by mechanical means, water or insects within groves while
long-distance spread is mostly by infected plant material. It affects
commercial citrus varieties and other members of the family
_Rutaceae_ posing a serious economic threat to citrus industries.
