[There have now been a total of 9 farm outbreaks associated with this
incident. H5N1 outbreaks in India started in January 2006 with 2
farms, 3 in March, and 2 in April 2006. This cluster was widely
dispersed and centered mostly in the western state of Maharashtra but
included 2 farms in Gujarat and 1 in Madhya Pradesh. In July 2007
there was an outbreak in Manpur, which borders Assam province.

In January this year (2008), there were 33 outbreaks, 4 occurred in
March, 3 in April, and 2 in May. The majority of these outbreaks were
located in West Bengal, although 3 occurred in the state of Tripura,
near Assam and Manipur.

Bangladesh, which is in between the outbreak areas of West Bengal and
Assam state of India has had massive outbreaks in 2007, totaling 287
farms. Obviously, there is concern now that more outbreaks in Assam
state will follow and ProMED-mail will keep you updated.

The 2 outbreak situations though do represent very different control
strategies, which follow from the different epidemiologic situations
as well as the previous experience the country has had with H5N1.

Hong Kong, if you recall was the 1st place in the world in 1997 where
the H5N1 virus emerged, although there is some thought that it had
existed in Guangzhou province for some time. The animal and public
health officials there eventually took the dramatic but highly
successful disease control measure of culling and shutting down the
markets, cleaning and disinfecting, while instituting the long term
measures detailed in the report above including biosecurity,
vaccination, and various surveillance strategies. Furthermore,
depopulation of the infected farm was carried out in less than 48
hours from the time clinical signs were noted. So it is not
surprising that the combination of aggressive disease control
tactics, a geographically circumscribed and limited number of
production premises, and a populace which has become highly aware of
and educated about the devastation occasioned by the incursion of the
H5N1 virus and how best to control it, would lead me to predict a
likelihood of success when it comes to controlling the disease in
Hong Kong. A sort of one and done situation is likely.

The situation in India projects a different picture though. There
have been hundreds of premises infected by H5N1 in nearby Bangladesh
and 42 farms affected last year (2007) in the nearby states of West
Bengal, Manipur, and Tripura. Seven of the 8 outbreaks occurred in
bird population whose epidemiologic unit was a village. The other one
was a chick-rearing farm. While it is good that there is
compensation, which is a critical element for success, this is also
apparently not a population that lends itself to vaccination at this
time (which can be helpful under the right circumstances). This
control program really relies on stamping out so it is a little bit
troublesome that the numbers in the OIE report presented here don't
quite add up. Case fatality rates on all the farms are 100 percent,
which indicates a virulent virus but mortality rates vary from less
than 10 percent to 100 percent. On 3 of the farms (Khanapara,
Nilibari, and Jalah), there appear to be 4220 exposed birds that did
not fall into the categories of die, destroyed, or slaughtered and
appear to be unaccounted for. On the chick-rearing farm, there were
1121 birds, which appear to be exposed but did not fall into the
categories of death, destroyed, or slaughtered. I suspect there are
good reasons for this apparent discrepancy and ProMED-mail would
definitely like to have more information on the course of the
outbreak. In any case, for all the reasons above, it not clear what
the future direction of the outbreak is likely to be. But one has to
be cautious and hope that the biosecurity education is increased
markedly and very effective stamping out procedures are put in place
quickly. - Mod.PC
