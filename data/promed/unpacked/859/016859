Newcastle Disease Confirmed in California
-------------------------------------
Officials with the California Department of Food and Agriculture
(CDFA) and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service
(APHIS) are conducting an eradication campaign for Newcastle
disease. The disease was confirmed on 1 Oct 2002 and is
restricted to backyard poultry.
Clinical signs in infected birds include respiratory, nervous, and
gastrointestinal signs. Mortality is up to 90 percent of exposed birds.
Commercial poultry, at this time, are not involved in the disease
occurrence. Investigations are on-going and all figures are pending
final validation.
Situation Update:
Number of premises positive: 76
Number of contacts: 182
Number of premises depopulated: 182
Premises waiting to be depopulated: 76
Birds depopulated to date: 16 000 (approximate)
Counties with positive flocks: Los Angeles, Riverside, San
Bernardino
Operational Update:
The date of the last discovered positive case of Newcastle disease in
California was 20 Nov 2002.
Effective 13 Nov 2002, the California State Veterinarian has
imposed a quarantine (Food and Agriculture Code Section 9562) on
the following counties: All of Los Angeles County; Portions of
Riverside County; Portions of San Bernardino County.
Effective 21 Nov 2002, APHIS has imposed a federal quarantine that
regulates the interstate movement of poultry and poultry products
from California's quarantined areas.
Poultry species affected by California's quarantine are:
Chickens, Turkeys, Ducks, Geese, Grouse, Partridges, Pheasants,
Quails, Guinea Fowl, Pea Fowl (Peacocks), Doves, Pigeons,
Swans, Ratites, Ratite Eggs [ratites include ostriches & emus -
Mod.JW]
State and federal animal health officials are condcting door-to-door
surveys to identify fowl and other birds in the affected areas and are
following up on all epidemiological associations. To date,
depopulation, cleaning and disinfecting, and carcass disposal are
being conducted by CDFA and APHIS. CDFA has closed all poultry
exhibits and fairs and expositions within the State of California.
The Newcastle disease situation is contained and is still considered
a single outbreak cluster within a 30-mile radius in Los Angeles
County and along the Los Angeles/Riverside/San Bernardino
County border.
Affected and exposed backyard poultry are being euthanized,
double-bagged, disinfecting the bags, and transporting the
carcasses to restricted landfills for burial.
All door-to-door surveillance, along with interviews has established
that there have been no links to eastern States within the United
States and no exposure to other backyard poultry in other States.
Local commercial table egg layer birds are being closely monitored
and will only be allowed to move intrastate under CDFA monitoring
and spent-hen movements restricted to the day they are scheduled
for processing.
Trade Issues: Nothing new to report.
Please forward this information to your federal, State, and industry
counterparts as necessary.
