Mysterious disease kills cattle in the village of El Porvenir
-------------------------------------------------------------
Dozens of cows and calves dying from a mysterious disease in Agua
Caliente, a village of El Porvenir in Francisco Morazan [department],
where the population is alarmed by the huge losses they are taking.

This community is experiencing dramatic moments, as many peoples'
main livelihood is the sale of cow milk and others lost their only
pair of oxen for plowing in the winter. Some people say that the cows
die suddenly and some say that the disease started after heavy rain
fell.

But some believe that [the cattle] are dying of rabies because they
start to fight among themselves, then they start trembling, falling to
the ground and they cannot get back up. There are also opinions that
the water from the Rio Grande [river] in the area was contaminated by
algae before the last rains during Easter week [18-24 Apr 2011].

Livestock owners are alarmed by the loss of so many cows. "These cows
are dying without getting sick from lack of grass or water; also they
remain on the banks of the Rio Grande," said a man who lost the only
pair of oxen he had.

The farmer said that when livestock owners visit their pastures they
are surprised to find more than one cow dead, although they had
already been medicated and "the strange thing is that the horses and
donkeys are not getting ill."

Several have already lost more than 10 head of cattle in recent days.
It is said that at present a head of cattle costs up to 6000 lempira
[about USD 318], so the losses are substantial. "Yesterday [24 Apr
2011] a relative visited his pasture and returned wild, pulling his
hair and almost crying, saying 2 dairy cows have died, and he needed
help to dispose of them," [the farmer] said.

Also, villagers complain that they no longer have milk for their
children, because in the places where the cows died and in some areas
where cows are still milking, people are afraid to buy [the milk]
because they think the disease may be transmitted to humans through
milk.

Meanwhile, [another farmer] said "It is very sad to see people crying
transporting their dead cows in the rear of trucks, some dumping them
on the banks of the river and others burning them in their pastures."

"The problem is that many have lost the only source of livelihood
they had and the worst is that when cows have just given birth the
calf is lost as well; and that is why people weep tears of sorrow," he
lamented.

Villagers comment that is the 1st time that a massive death toll in
cattle has occurred, because in that sector there is always grass and
water and they undertake vaccination against several diseases,
including blackleg, and deworming. He explained that, "here in Agua
Caliente in recent days almost all the dogs walk with the belly
bloated from eating so much cow meat in the river and in the
pastures." He said that the pestilence is felt in the environment with
so many dead cows.

Villagers recall that 2 years ago the same thing happened in El
Porvenir, about 10 km [6 mi] from Agua Caliente, but at the time it
was suspected that it was caused by water contaminated by mining in
Valle de Siria. However, in this area they dismiss that possibility
because of the distance, but authorities should determine the true
cause of death and [alleviate] the fear that the disease can be
transmitted to humans.

[Unfortunately this article is long on expressing compassion but
short on clinical signs that could be beneficial. The list of diseases
to be ruled out might include rabies, perhaps anthrax, toxic plants
are capable of causing neurological disease, water deprivation - salt
intoxication. The photos on the original article make me think the
animals have been dead for some time before they were found, but
perhaps that is only evidence of the numbers dying.

Although anthrax would not cause a disease that may appear to be
neurological, it may account for the deaths, if they are sudden
deaths. If the dogs of the area are eating the carcass, then it may
not be anthrax.

If the river is used as a source for drinking water, then disposing
of the carcasses in the river may create a new set of issues for the
people.

Perhaps a veterinarian will get some samples and lab results will
shed more light on this situation. -Mod.TG]
