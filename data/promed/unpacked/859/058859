Leishmaniasis is increasing in Spain
------------------------------------
Between 20 and 80 people each year suffer from a severe infection of
leishmaniasis, a disease that is transmitted from animal -- mostly
dogs -- to humans, causing fever and swollen liver and spleen and is
fatal in up to 5 percent of cases experts said this Wednesday at the
Infectopatolog√≠a Course II, held this week in Madrid.

As explained by the representative of the Center for Infectious
Diseases and International Health in Malaga and co-coordinator of the
conference, Dr. Fernando Farinas, this disease has become in recent
years on a "forgotten disease" despite the sandfly which transmits it
being endemic in Spain and infecting 5 of every hundred dogs per year
(possibly more).

Leishmaniasis is a zoonotic disease -- a condition shared by dogs and
humans, not transmitted by direct contact between man and animal but
through insect vectors which become infected after biting the main
reservoir of the parasite, the dog.

On the human side, leishmaniasis is particularly virulent in
immunocompromised patients (HIV, cancer or malnutrition mainly) and
may occur in 2 forms: the visceral, more serious and the cutaneous,
more benign and prevalent, that manifests itself through skin ulcers,
which are often confused with psoriasis.

The latter option is worryingly under-diagnosed in Spain, says Dr
Farinas, something that is making it easier for parasites to develop
"hyper-resistance" to the drugs most commonly used against them.
However, Spain has effective new medicines to eliminate these
pathogens [but see comment below].

This infectious disease specialist has said you cannot neglect the
research side of this disease, "it has been detected in patients with
HIV [infection] when the human is both reservoir and victim, without
the dog."

An extended illness all over Spain
----------------------------------
Regarding the incidence of canine leishmaniasis, regions in Spain most
affected so far are Andalusia, Palme Mallorca, Valencia and Catalonia.
However, in recent years it has been shown that not only the typical
Mediterranean climate zones are prone to the disease. According to the
latest data, areas of northern Spain are registering more and more
cases of dogs affected by leishmaniasis. In the Basque Country,
Galicia and Madrid, infections in dogs have increased 50 percent in
the last 15 years.

The head of the Department of Parasitology and Parasitic Diseases of
the Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Guadalupe Miro, stressed that
"only 5 percent of dogs are diagnosed with this disease, when in fact
about 60 percent are infected.

[Leishmaniasis is endemic in Spain with dogs as the main reservoir, as
is also the case in Portugal, southern France, Italy, Malta and
Greece. A special concern is the association between clinical
leishmaniasis and immunosuppression e.g. HIV-infection or organ
transplants. A recent review reported more than 2000 such cases from
southern Europe over the past 10 years (Alvar J et al. The
relationship between leishmaniasis and AIDS: the second 10 years. Clin
Microbiol Rev. 2008;21:334-59). The role of dogs as reservoir in Spain
has also recently been reviewed (Miro G et al. Canine
leishmaniasis--new concepts and insights on an expanding zoonosis:
part two. Trends Parasitol. 2008;24:371-7).

Clearly, leishmaniasis is a increasing zoonotic infection in southern
Europe, which must be considered in cases with unexplained cutaneous
symptoms, long term low grade fever, weight loss and splenomegaly. -

["[The disease is] under-diagnosed in Spain ... something that is
making it easier for parasites to develop "hyper-resistance" to the
drugs most commonly used against them" seems to be a non sequitur. If
the disease is not being diagnosed, it is not being treated with
specific drugs (pentavalent antimonials, pentamidine) therefore cannot
develop resistance to them. - Mod.JW]
