Headlines
• Pakistan floods: WHO EMRO has released USD 4 million in emergency funding for Pakistan, while polio teams are supporting disease surveillance for other diseases during the flood emergency. Dr Hamid Jafari, WHO EMRO Director for Polio Eradication, said via his Twitter account: "Heartbreaking sights from Pakistan, as the damage to the lives, livelihoods and health of people requires all of us to come together and provide support. WHO has been activated to provide emergency support to the Government of Pakistan with medical supplies and expertise, and of course our polio workforce is assisting efforts."

• African Ministers of Health Commit to Polio Eradication Efforts: This year's [2022] detection of imported wild poliovirus in Malawi and Mozambique set off a series of coordinated campaigns across East Africa, as countries acted to swiftly protect their populations and prevent further transmission. On 24 Aug 2022, in a special side session to the 72nd Meeting of the WHO Regional Committee for Africa in Lomé, Togo, Ministers of Health from these responding countries committed to improving vaccination campaigns, strengthening disease surveillance and continuing to lead in the rollout of the novel oral polio vaccine (nOPV2), hearing from Dr. Matshidiso Moeti (Director, WHO AFRO), Dr. Modjirom Ndoutabe (Polio Programme Coordinator, WHO AFRO) and Chris Elias (Chair, Polio Oversight Board) on what is needed to keep Africa wild polio-free.

• nOPV2 rollout: Approximately 450 million doses of nOPV2 have been administered across 22 countries under its WHO Emergency Use Listing (EUL) to date. An additional 16 countries have met the requirements for nOPV2 use in the event of an outbreak. More information on nOPV2 at https://polioeradication.org/nopv2/.

• Last week, the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on immunization (SAGE) Polio Working Group convened at WHO in Geneva, Switzerland, to discuss policy options and will formulate recommendations for endorsement to the upcoming full SAGE meeting, on 3-6 Oct 2022.

[Poliovirus, both the wild virus (WPV1) and circulating vaccine derived poliovirus, continues to be identified globally. Note that while Pakistan reported 1 new AFP case in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, there were 2 positive environmental samples in Punjab. The continued occurrence of WPV1 associated AFP cases in Mozambique associated with circulation of a virus from Pakistan is disconcerting -- a total of 5 cases have been identified. cVDPV2 AFP cases were identified in Benin, Chad, DR Congo, Niger, Nigeria, Somalia and Yemen and positive ES samples were identified in Central African Republic, Djibouti and Ghana. It's curious that the VDPV2 activity in Israel, UK and the USA do not make it to updates on the global activity.

The headlines for this past week mention the rollout of the more stable novel OPV2. One hopes it will help interrupt the cycles of cVDPV2, outbreak control measures with OPV2, then development of new cVDPV2 outbreaks. Time will tell.

A reminder that the presence of cVDPVs occurs when there are lower than protective vaccine coverages and a sign that if a poliovirus (be it a WPV or a VDPV) is introduced, it can easily be transmitted in the communities.

A map showing the locations of each confirmed case of polio worldwide in the past 12 months can be found at https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/. One can see cases of cVDPV in a band across Africa and in Israel, Ukraine, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan; cVDPV1 in Madagascar and Yemen, and WPV1 in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Malawi and Mozambique. - Mod.MPP]

[2] Pakistan WPV1: 15th case details
Date: Sat 27 Aug 2022

https://en.dailypakistan.com.pk/27-Aug-2022/pakistan-reports-another-polio-case-in-north-waziristan


Pakistan has reported the 15th polio case of this year [2022] as the health authorities detected 1 more case in the country's North Waziristan tribal district.

This time, a 17-month-old boy has been diagnosed with the polio disease in Ghulam Khan area, reports said. According to preliminary investigations, the child developed symptoms on [21 Aug 2002]. Health authorities said that the total number of cases in North Waziritan has reached 14.

Reports said that polio virus was found in environmental samples from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab and Islamabad.

The southern districts of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, namely North and South Waziristan, DI Khan, Bannu, Tank and Lakki Marwat, are at the highest risk of wild poliovirus, per reports.

Earlier, the South Asian nation has made tremendous success against polio over the past few years.

Polio is a highly infectious and debilitating disease that is usually spread through contaminated water or food. Invading the nervous system, the disease can cause total paralysis within hours.

The contagious virus thrived in the borderlands between Pakistan and Afghanistan where militants attacked and even killed anti-polio teams.

[3] USA (NY) cVDPV2: 4th wastewater system, Sullivan County
Date: Sun 28 Aug 2022

Health officials continue to urge those unvaccinated against polio to get immunized after the virus was found in a 4th municipal wastewater system.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's sequencing analysis detected poliovirus in 4 Sullivan County samples, 2 collected in July [2022] and 2 collected in August [2022], the state Health Department said Friday [26 Aug 2022]. The virus was genetically-linked to the same that infected a person in July [2022] in Rockland County -- a patient who suffered paralysis.

Poliovirus had already been found in Rockland and Orange County wastewater this summer [2022], as well as in New York City. In a report earlier this month [August 2022], the CDC said that poliovirus may have been circulating for up to a year in New York.

"One New Yorker paralyzed by polio is already too many and I do not want to see another paralytic case," state Health Commissioner Dr. Mary T. Bassett said in a statement. "The polio in New York today is an imminent threat to all adults and children who are unvaccinated or not up to date with their polio immunizations. Every New Yorker, parent, guardian, and pediatrician must do everything possible to ensure they, their children, and their patients are protected against this dangerous, debilitating disease through safe and effective vaccination."

The state Health Department said unvaccinated New Yorkers who live, work, go to school in, or visit Rockland County, Orange County, New York City and Sullivan County are at the highest risk of contracting paralytic disease.

The person who contracted polio was unvaccinated and had not traveled recently. The strain they were infected with mutated from a live version used in a vaccine that is not given in the U.S. While the virus used in the Sabin vaccine is too weak to cause polio symptoms, if it mutates enough times, it could eventually become strong enough to cause paralysis or death, scientists say.

According to the CDC, the New York case is only the 2nd identification of community transmission of poliovirus in the U.S. since 1979.

Meanwhile, Orange, Rockland and Sullivan counties have polio vaccination rates that are well below the state average. As of [1 Aug 2022], Rockland County had a polio vaccination rate of 60.3%, Orange County 58.7%, and Sullivan County 62.3% -- compared to the statewide average of 79% among children who have received 3 polio immunizations before their 2nd birthday. The state wants a vaccination rate of well over 90%. Children who attend public school in New York must show proof of polio vaccination.

"There is no cure for polio, but it can be prevented with safe and effective vaccination which has been available for a very long time in the U.S. to eliminate the disease," said Sullivan County Health Direction Nancy McGraw in a statement. "Polio is among the top preventable diseases, and we have the ability to stop this in its tracks as long as people take the importance of immunizations seriously."

Health officials can monitor the spread of disease in a community by testing sewage water -- a process previously used to follow the spread of COVID-19. People infected with polio shed the virus in their stool. However, the state isn't testing wastewater in all counties. The focus has just been in areas surrounding Rockland County, where the 1st case was reported, the Department of Health has said. The efforts, however, will continue to expand, the state said.

Polio is very contagious and presents itself as asymptomatic in most cases. About 25% of those infected will experience mild or flu-like symptoms that many will attribute to some other illness. Patients experience paralysis and life-threatening symptoms in about 1% of cases. The virus enters the body through the mouth, usually from hands contaminated with the feces of an infected person. Respiratory and oral-to-oral transmission through saliva may also occur. Health officials said it's important to note that alcohol-based sanitizers do not work on some types of germs, like polio. Handwashing with soap has proven to be effective.

[Rockland, Orange and Sullivan counties in New York State can be seen at https://geology.com/county-map/new-york.shtml. Sullivan County is adjacent to the Northern border of Orange County, Rockland County is adjacent to Westchester County (separated by the Hudson River) and Orange County is adjacent to Rockland County, both located in the south eastern part of the state. NYC is located to the southeast of Rockland County. The virus is clearly circulating in these communities and luckily no additional AFP cases have been identified to date. - Mod.MPP]
