Health and government officials in Cote d'Ivoire have announced a range of
measures to stamp out bird flu after the discovery of at least 3 outbreaks
in the main city Abidjan.
Minister of animal production and fish resources, Alphonse Douaty, said on
Friday that veterinarians are to cull all poultry in markets through the
city as the government prepares a system for reimbursement. "We want to
have a sanitary vacuum at these markets," Douaty said.
The ministry was also planning to inspect industrial poultry farms and
issue a stamp of approval to reassure costumers. The city's 4 million
people will be able to call a free hotline. Douaty said the government
needed at least 6 billion CFA, or 11 million dollars, to compensate poultry
farmers and combat the disease. The first cases of bird flu were reported
on 26 Apr 2006 by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), but the
Ivorian government only this week issued official confirmation.
The latest of the 3 outbreaks was found in domestically kept chickens in
the populous suburb of Yopougon, according to Daouda Coulibaly of the
National Institute for Public Hygiene. Coulibaly said several people in the
area were being monitored for potential human infections of the H5N1 avian
virus.
