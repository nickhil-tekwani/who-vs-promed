The island has been hit by a major dengue outbreak, with some 13
reported cases since last month [October 2007], health authorities
here have said.

Last month [October 2007], the nation was placed on an alert for an
outbreak of the mosquito borne illness, which has already resulted in
deaths in neighboring Martinique.

Authorities said while there have so far been no deaths, the number
of cases so far reported is one short of the total number reported
last year [2006].

The government's Chief Medical Officer, Josiah Rambally, told CMC
over the weekend that most of the cases were recorded in the capital
Castries and that everything possible is being done to ensure that no
deaths result.

"We have a team of health and environmental officers visiting
communities around the island in an effort to control the spread of
the illness," he said.

"They will be checking to see if anyone has fever and the environment
around homes, ensuring that possible sources of mosquito breeding are
eliminated."

Rambally said that fogging teams have also been operating in areas
prone to mosquito infection to eliminate the adult mosquitoes and
applying insecticide that will kill the mosquito larvae and pupae.

"We are appealing to the public to assist in this by doing what they
can to reduce the number of breeding places for mosquitoes, such as
old tires, coconut shells, and any items where water can stagnate,
facilitating the breeding of mosquitoes," he said.

Dr. Rambally said the outbreak of dengue has become a source of
concern with the number of cases of death reported around the region.

"Whenever there is an outbreak anywhere, especially places where we
travel to, it's easy for people to come back and cause an outbreak in
their country of origin, so we need to increase our vigilance," he said.

He said that every year the island needed to go on the alert for
dengue, but more so in this period, given the fact that Martinique
has reported an outbreak of dengue virus type 4.

"We are not saying that St. Lucians should cease all travel to
Martinique, but those going there need to be aware of the clear and
present danger of being infected," he said. St. Lucia has recorded 2
major outbreaks of dengue fever, with the most recent being in 2002.

The Ministry of Health has been advising persons against the
indiscriminate disposal of garbage in drains and ravines, as this can
result in breeding sites for mosquitoes.

It has also urged persons experiencing high fever associated with
headache and joint pain to seek immediate medical attention.

"We have a surveillance system in place so that anyone with these
symptoms needs to seek immediate medical attention, and we would want
that report to get to the Ministry so we can implement our control
measures," Dr. Rambally said.

[2] Brazil (Sao Paulo State)
Date: Thu 15 Nov 2007
Source: O Estado de Sao Paulo [in Portuguese, trans. & summ. Mod.TY, edited]

This year [2007] in Sao Paulo state, classical dengue fever killed
more people than dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). From January 2007 up
until the present, according to the state's Secretary of Health,
there have been 18 deaths from classical dengue fever and 16 from
DHF. These 2 numbers are attention-getting because dengue deaths have
been associated more with the hemorrhagic form of the disease. Deaths
resulting from classical dengue fever are less frequent.

In the evaluation of Dr. Luiz Jose de Souza, Director of the Dengue
Evaluation Center of Campos dos Goytacazes, the high number of deaths
from classical dengue in Sao Paulo could be related to the
dissemination in the state of dengue virus 3, which is more
aggressive than the other dengue virus types, and to the lack of
physician preparation to diagnose the disease correctly.

Of the 34 deaths that occurred this year [2007] in Sao Paulo, most of
them, 15, were registered in the month of March.

Although still not over, 2007 has now been the year with the greatest
number of dengue cases in the history of Sao Paulo. Up until now, 78
600 people have been recorded infected. The previous record was in
2001, when there were 51 700 dengue cases in the state.

The Secretary said, however, that the situation is not out of
control. He affirmed that they are working with the prefectures in
order to combat the foci of mosquito transmission and to correctly
diagnose this disease.

[It is difficult to ascertain with confidence what the data are.
Dengue is dengue, and the definition of DHF many times is inadequate;
many ill patients do not meet the case definition. It is high time we
worked with a different set of definitions. - Mod.JLS]
