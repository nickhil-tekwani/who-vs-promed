[We have unconfirmed but reliable information of outbreaks reported in
Bauchi state from 18 Feb 2006, later than the date of this report. For
location of these areas in Northern Nigeria, see

idea of the distance from Kano to Jos, a wonderfully scenic drive up on to
the plateaus that would take the better part of a day's drive when I used
to do it 25 years ago. - Mod.PC]

[The value of these OIE reports is that they are more detailed than the
usual releases in terms of number of birds affected and tests used and
results obtained. Furthermore, they often include maps, which help to
geographically locate the actual outbreak site, which can help put a
picture of the outbreak in a country together. - Mod.PC]
