Ebola is all but over, but the postmortem is just getting started
-----------------------------------------------------------------
[This is a long, comprehensive but readable report on what has gone wrong with Ebola control. But it could give the impression that most of the problem was with the WHO's response, although the report makes it clear that most of the blame lies with WHO's member states, which have hamstrung WHO's epidemic response capability since 2009 by cutting the budget for that activity. I have written a critique of this article below. - Mod.JW]

[Ebola is not WHO's fault
------------------------
As a former CDC staff member seconded to WHO Geneva for 8 years, followed by 6 more with WHO, I am fed up with reports hammering WHO over its handling of the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. The headline of the latest report in the Guardian ("Ebola is all but over, but the postmortem is just getting started," of 30 Sep 2015, available at the source URL above) is unexceptional, but the text leads with "Thousands died in west Africa, but the biggest victim could be the ineffectual World Health Organisation, which acted far too slowly to contain the outbreak." However, it is obvious from the rest of the report that WHO did a lot of things right, and moved as fast as it could given its financial and political constraints.

WHO was on the ground a week from 1st confirmation of the disease and is still there for the long haul, after the UN Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER) has declared victory, packed up, and gone home without waiting for the last case to leave hospital, with hundreds of contacts still in quarantine, and many, many contacts lost to follow-up. But I am not disputing the fact that the UN contribution of air transport and logistics has been essential to success in the field.

WHO is expected to take care of the world's health on a budget of USD 3 billion -- the same as that of the 2500 bed New York-Presbyterian Hospital! -- with most of it earmarked for health issues other than outbreaks of infectious disease, at the express directive of its member states. WHO has performed well overall given the constraints mentioned above.

WHO is not the world health police. It cannot order a country to turn its national soccer stadium in the middle of the capital into an Ebola treatment centre, over the objection of neighbouring residents, despite the advantages of ease of communication and logistics at the site. The people know that patients interned there would easily be able to abscond into the city, contaminating others en route. WHO cannot punish a government for not complying with basic infection control precepts because it lacks equipment, supplies, infrastructure, and trained health workers -- sanctions would in any case not help towards disease surveillance or control. It is much more difficult when people believe that the disease is due to witchcraft, leading to spread by infected faith healers, and funeral rites involving touching the dead -- or even a government scam to get international aid for their leaders to pocket.

The Guardian reports that after the flu pandemic of 2009 the epidemic preparedness staff were cut by 30 per cent, and in the beginning, "the Sierra Leone government said they had Ebola under control, and didn't need WHO... The focus [in WHO] had turned to the growing problems of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) -- lifestyle-related heart attacks, strokes, cancers, and diabetes -- in response to the demands of the member states that make up its executive board.

"But some in Geneva were more concerned about the potential devastation to west African economies that declaring an international emergency would cause -- which did indeed prove the case. Was it WHO's fault that an Ebola-infected man from Liberia hospitalized in Dallas [USA] exactly a year before this report was mishandled, leading to the infection of 2 nurses and a nationwide panic -- a month after WHO had declared the epidemic a Public Health Emergency of International Concern?

It is hardly WHO's fault that in Magazine Wharf, one of the slums in Freetown, Sierra Leone's capital, there is only one toilet for 1000 people. Or that screening of travelers across porous west African borders was (and still is) inadequate, or that Ebola patients, even including some physicians and nurses, ignored self-quarantine and traveled widely, spreading the infection.

Was it WHO's fault that an Ebola-infected man arriving in Nigeria from Liberia, who suffered an acute crisis in Lagos airport was not immediately identified as a risk, leading to the death of the doctor who attended him, and several others? Or that torrential rains annually make roads impassable and severely hamper construction of new facilities for treating Ebola patients? The article makes it clear that the bulk of the problem was the parlous state of those countries' health services, now acknowledged at the UN General Assembly by president Ellen Sirleaf of Liberia, and lack of communication both within and between countries.

Yet, all the headlines pillory WHO for not preventing thousands of deaths in those countries. International health aid from foreign governments and NGOs has been poured into those countries for decades, with little to show for it. If the international community wants WHO to take on epidemic control, let its member states put their money where their mouth is and give it the funds to re-organize, with its own aircraft and logistics arm rivaling what other UN agencies are already equipped to provide, and the teeth to enforce the International Health Regulations.

There is balance in the reporting -- let's have some balance in the headlines! - Mod.JW
