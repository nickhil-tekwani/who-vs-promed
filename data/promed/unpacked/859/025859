Bluetongue update: extension of protection zone to allow further vaccination
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Defra has today announced that the Bluetongue Protection Zones will
be extended and merged on Mon 12 May 2008, following the delivery of
additional doses of Bluetongue vaccine.

Vaccination is only permitted within the Protection Zone therefore in
accordance with the Bluetongue vaccination plan, the Protection Zones
will be merged by extending the zones into all of Hampshire and West
Sussex. The Protection Zone will also be extended into all of
Lincolnshire, Berkshire and Oxfordshire. The Surveillance Zone is unaffected.

A further 1 million doses of vaccine, available in 50 dose bottles,
are available for use in the Protection Zone today. Livestock keepers
in the areas coming into the Protection Zone on Monday will be able
to obtain vaccine from that date. They are encouraged to order
vaccine so that they can protect their livestock at the earliest opportunity.

Those keepers coming into the new Protection Zone will be subject to
the same restrictions as those in the existing Protection Zone.
Animals can only be moved out of the Protection Zone if they are
vaccinated, naturally immune or for slaughter, subject to meeting
certain conditions.

Defra has also today published an epidemiology report on the
distribution of Bluetongue infection in Great Britain, based on
surveillance work up to 15 Mar 2008 [see item 2].

The evidence considered in the report suggests that Bluetongue has
not spread beyond the current Protection Zone boundaries. This
supports our vaccination strategy which has been devised to tackle
the most at-risk areas first, gradually expanding the Protection Zone
westward as more vaccine becomes available.

Report on the distribution of bluetongue infection in Great Britain
on 15 Mar 2008, May 2008
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prepared by the National Emergency Epidemiology Group

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
-----------------
1. This report reviews the evidence to assess where else BTV may
have existed in the period up to 15 Mar 2008, the end of the winter
2007/8 vector free period (VFP). It uses data gathered during the
implementation of 3 disease control measures and 2 targeted
surveillance activities. All analyses have been conducted at the county level.

2. By 15 Mar 2008 BTV has been confirmed on 125 holdings in 13
counties in the east and south of England as a result of the
investigation of suspect clinical cases, local surveillance and
pre-movement testing (PMT) of animals moved under licence from the
Protection Zone (PZ) and Surveillance Zone (SZ) during the VFP. The
known geographic distribution of bluetongue virus type 8 [BTV-8]
infection in domestic livestock in Great Britain (GB) and the
location of current and initial disease control zones is shown in
Figure 1 [see at the above URL].

3. BTV has also been found, in individual animals that originated
from East Anglia, on 2 holdings as a result of tracing potentially
infected animals moved out of the East Anglia Protection Zone (PZ1)
prior to disclosure of disease. One is in Leicestershire, close to
the PZ boundary, and the other in Staffordshire, towards the western
side of the SZ. Testing of other animals on these premises is in
progress; the PMT data suggests widespread infection has a higher
likelihood in Leicestershire than Staffordshire.

4. Review of the available evidence indicates that BTV-8 is likely
to have become widespread in the East Anglian PZ (PZ1) during 2007,
with many holdings affected. The likelihood of infection of
susceptible species with BTV-8 reduces across the country from east
to west, however some evidence raises the possibility that the
western boundary of PZ1 should be further west. Therefore this
boundary line may be treated with a slight degree of caution,
although no specific evidence points to it being incorrectly defined.
Nevertheless, this boundary should be reviewed, if it is to be used
to define those holdings with similar high likelihood of having
become infected during 2007, and therefore most likely to provide a
focus for recrudescence of BTV-8 in 2008.

5. The surveillance of cattle herds within 10 km [6.2 miles] of the
Poole case (a single infected animal disclosed by PMT) is almost
complete and, to date, there is no evidence of BTV in any other herds
in this area. There is little evidence to inform discussion as to the
likelihood of BTV being present in the area between PZ1 and PZ2.

6. The evidence raises concern that BTV-8 is present, possibly to
the same extent as in East Anglia, further north along the east coast
of England. However there is no evidence to suggest that such
widespread infection is present elsewhere in GB. The evidence from
tracings that shows that BTV was not moved by animal movements into
the SZ and Free Area, other than the 2 cases described above, and the
distribution of confirmed and negative report cases provide
supporting evidence that BT is unlikely to be in the Free Area.

7. The statements in this report are based on the best available
evidence. It is important to note that this evidence is far from
complete for a full epidemiological analysis, and that much of the
data used was collected for purposes other than this analysis.
However, the purpose of this report is to use the available evidence
to inform whether further surveillance work is required.

8. The limitations in our knowledge about BTV-8 and reconciliation
of the data to allow collation of different datasets has required a
number of assumptions to be made that could reduce the accuracy and
representativeness of these estimates. In particular (i) the lack of
knowledge as to how BT over-winters, (ii) its rate of spread within
herds and across the country through local midge infection, and (iii)
the extent of illegal or unreported movements of animals, coupled
with the variable quality of these data that has necessitated
estimation of missing data and extensive cross-verification.

9. Although there has been no additional widespread surveillance,
such as sentinel animal or bulk milk testing, over 55 000 animals in
the SZ have been examined for BTV by pre-movement testing. Thus the
level of certainty about BT distribution is different in different areas of GB.

Vaccination is only permitted within the Protection Zone, therefore
in accordance with the Bluetongue vaccination plan, the Protection
Zones are being merged by extending the zones into all of Hampshire
and West Sussex. The Protection Zone, extended into all of
Lincolnshire, Berkshire and Oxfordshire, and the (unaffected)
Surveillance Zone, as coming into force on Mon 12 May 2008, are
described in the declaration and map at:
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/notifiable/bluetongue/pdf/declaration-bt-pzsz080509.pdf>.

The BTV-8 vaccination has started in England on 1 May 2008, following
the release of 3 million doses of vaccine, out of the 22.5 million
doses, ordered last year (see 20080502.1508).

On 7 May 2008, Defra issued a tender for 13 million additional doses
of the vaccine, 8 million for use in England and 5 million for use in
Wales; see Defra's press release at:
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2008/080507d.htm>.

Under EU law, vaccination is only allowed in a Protection Zone. The
Bluetongue vaccination plan sets out how vaccination will be rolled
out and the Protection Zone expanded county by county across England,
taking into account the availability of vaccine and the level of
disease risk. - Mod.AS]
