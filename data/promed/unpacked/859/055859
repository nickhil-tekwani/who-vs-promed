A vaccination campaign against yellow fever in [Democratic Republic of] Congo's capital Kinshasa is almost complete, but the gains may be reversed by the looming rainy season and the spread of the disease to areas where people have not yet been vaccinated, the World Health Organization said on Friday [26 Aug 2016].

Although the campaign wrapped up on Friday, the WHO's spokesman in the DRC, Eugene Kabambi said health workers will continue over the coming days to seek out individuals they missed.

Health officials began a campaign to vaccinate 7.5 million people in Kinshasa last week to combat the worst outbreak in decades of the hemorrhagic virus. More than 400 people have died in Congo and neighboring Angola since December [2015].

Health authorities aim to vaccinate some 14 million people in the 2 countries by the end of August [2016] to halt the spread of the disease before the rainy season sets in next month [September].

The WHO said as of Thursday [25 Aug 2016], 6 925 276 people, or 91.3 percent of the target population, in Kinshasa had been vaccinated in the latest campaign.

About 2 million people were vaccinated in Kinshasa during campaigns in May and July [2016].

[The vaccination campaign in Kinshasa city seems to have gone extremely well with nearly 7 million individuals vaccinated last week and 2 million previously. Presumably, individuals in Kinshasa were vaccinated with 1/5 the usual dose (dose fractionation) because of limited available stocks of the vaccine. One hopes that the campaign will continue to provide coverage in other localities before the rainy season makes many roads in more remote areas in Angola and the DR Congo impassable.

There is a nice series of photographs depicting the Kinshasa vaccination campaign published in the Guardian https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2016/aug/26/fighting-yellow-fever-in-the-democratic-republic-of-congo-in-pictures.- Mod.TY
