The bird flu virus has been detected in a poultry farm in the Qalqiliya district [West Bank], vets from the PA [Palestinian Authority] Ministry of Agriculture said Wednesday [21 Jan 2015].

Dr. Samir al-Fuqaha said the farm holds some 5000 hens, 4000 of which have now been culled.

Villages in a radius of 10 km [about 6 miles] from the farm in [Bayt Amin] have been put under strict supervision, and samples have already been taken to prevent the spread of the disease.

The Ministry of Agriculture on Monday [19 Jan 2015] culled 5000 turkeys infected with bird flu in the village of Siris in Jenin [West Bank].

The Israeli Civil Administration has provided equipment and medical supplies to the PA to control the outbreak.

Gaza's Ministry of Agriculture on Thursday [22 Jan 2015] decided to stop importing poultry and other livestock from the West Bank and Israel via the Kerem Shalom crossing following an outbreak of bird flu.

Zakariya al-Kafarneh, General Director of the Veterinary Services of the ministry, told Ma'an that the decision was made to protect against the spread of bird flu in the coastal territory.

Gaza is nearly entirely self sufficient in poultry, producing enough chickens for 90 percent of local demand, while 10 percent is imported, he added.

17 000 breeding chickens have been destroyed on Fri 23 Jan 2015 in Binyamina [Haifa district] due to suspected avian influenza. Binyamina is situated about 3 km [about 2 miles] from the initial outbreak in Moshav Aviel, where 100 000 turkeys have been culled on Sat-Sun, 17-18 Jan 2015 (see 20150119.3102962).

Today, Sat 24 Jan 2015, a turkey farm near Magal, about 20 km [about 12 miles] south of the mentioned farms, has been found suspected of avian influenza. This farm belongs to the same company operating the 1st outbreak in Aviel.

[Confirmation (or otherwise) of the suspected outbreak in the turkey operation at Magal is anticipated soon. In case confirmed, this will mean a spread of the disease in spite of the rigorous eradication measures undertaken. Magal is situated close to the old "green line" separating Israel from the West Bank.

The spread in the West Bank should not surprise since, as reported by the authorities to the OIE (see 20150121.3108879), "the farmer slaughtered 4000 birds from the infected flock before the confirmation of the outbreak." During the 2006 outbreak, the virus spread extensively in the West Bank. For Bayt Amin's location, see http://tinyurl.com/lpqksjr. - Mod.AS
