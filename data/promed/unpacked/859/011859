A bacterium known to cause Q-Fever in humans has been detected in a high percentage of rodents in Algonquin Park.

A team of Laurentian University biology researchers, led by Canada Research Chair Dr. Albrecht Schulte-Hostedde, have found evidence of the spread of the zoonotic bacterium _Coxiella burnetii_ in wildlife in the park and say their findings suggest that some visitors to the park could be at risk of infection.

According to a Laurentian University press release, the bacterium was "detected in 6 out of 7 species of wild rodents tested within the boundaries of Algonquin Park, including red squirrels, flying squirrels and deer mice. It was also found in flying squirrels in the Peterborough area, indicating that the bacterium may be widespread among these animal populations in Ontario."

The bacterium is a cause of Query fever, also known as Q-Fever, in humans.

According to the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA) website: "Human Q fever is primarily an occupational disease of farmers, abattoir workers, veterinarians, and laboratory workers."

The disease is a flu-like illness that often remains undiagnosed. In a minority of cases, it can cause a clinical atypical pneumonia or hepatitis. If the disease becomes chronic, endocarditis and chronic hepatitis can develop. Chronic Q fever can be fatal, and is more likely to develop in immuno-compromised individuals and pregnant women.

The OMAFRA website states: "In Ontario, Q-fever has occasionally been diagnosed as a cause of abortion in sheep and goats. Reported human cases have been associated with exposure to abortions in sheep and goats, and drinking unpasteurised goat's milk."

"It can be transmitted reasonably easily among wildlife," Schulte-Hostedde said. "The suggestion is that people can get it from, like the hantavirus, inhaling feces. Let's say you have a cottage or a camp and sweep the corners. Any fecal material will dry and aerosolize, it goes up in the air and you inhale some of it."

In 2007, an outbreak in the Netherlands resulted in the infection of more than 2000 people. Thousands of goats were culled.

"There is a lot of interest in Europe now on how this pathogen is transmitted in the natural environment," said Schulte-Hostedde. He says there is a hypothesis that ticks may be a cause of the spread of this pathogen.

Schulte-Hostedde says he has spoken intensively to an Algonquin Park biologist who has indicated that there have been no reports of people becoming ill with Q-Fever.

"In terms of mortality, I don't think it's going to kill anybody. There are no huge numbers of people reporting being ill," he said. "We put the press release out not to alarm people but so that the public health authorities know that this bug is out there." He says this might be quite a large spread, and there are different strains of the pathogen, some that may be more dangerous than others. "We don't know anything about the strain that we found versus what might be found on farms," he said. He says after discussions with Public Health Ontario and the Public Health Agency of Canada that they are aware that it is out there, and it is reportable at some levels.

"They are aware that it happens on farms, but there is no real work that is being done on _Coxiella burnetii_ in the natural environment," he said. "My point with the whole thing ... it is just providing awareness that there is a microbrobe that can make you sick, so you should take some precautions."

Schulte-Hostedde says he is in the process of returning to his initial studies, and a zoonotics expert at the University of Guelph is hoping to attain OMAFRA funding to study this bacterium in a natural environment because there are still many questions to be answered, including whether it is being transferred from farm to the natural environment or vice versa, and whether the strains are the same.

"It has an interesting history, because it has been the subject of weaponization research in the United States," he said. "That's part of the sexy thing about this thing. It actually can infect people relatively easily, which is part of the history of human relationships with this bacteria."

He says in order to get the real story beyond the initial findings and the hundreds of animals tested, there is much more work to be done.

[The initial description of Q fever as an illness was among abattoir workers in Australia. Q fever is a zoonosis, but humans are the animals to usually develop illness as a result of infection. The main route of infection is the inhalation of _C. burnetii_. The desiccation-resistant organism is shed from infected animals, usually cattle, sheep, goats or cats, especially at the time of parturition. Air samples are positive for weeks following parturition, and viable organisms are present in the soil for periods of up to 150 days.

Wild animals may be very important in the epidemiology of Q fever. Doves are felt to be responsible for introducing _C. burnetii_ to Northern Ireland. A wide variety of fish, rodents and marsupials have been shown to be infected by _C. burnetii_.

Ticks are probably of great importance in keeping the cycle of _C. burnetii_ going in nature. The pathogen multiplies in the cells of the midgut of the tick and is excreted in the feces of the tick during feeding.

In this report, it is not clear whether they detected antibodies against _C. burnetii_ or the pathogen itself.
