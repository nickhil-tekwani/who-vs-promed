["Rabies is still a pervasive global threat. Half of the world's population live in an endemic area, and more than 80% of deaths occur in rural areas where access to health-education campaigns and post-bite prophylaxis is limited or nonexistent. Africa and Asia are the continents with the highest risk of human mortality, with more than 95% of the world's fatal cases. These regions are also those where canine rabies is controlled the least.

"More than 95% of human cases of rabies are due to bites from infected dogs. Controlling and eradicating rabies therefore means combatting it at its animal source.

"Mass vaccination of dogs is the method of choice, as this is the only real way to interrupt the disease's infectious cycle between animals and humans. It is estimated that by vaccinating 70% of the dogs where infection is still rife, rabies could be eradicated in dogs, and the number of human cases would rapidly drop to almost zero. Excellent anti-rabies vaccines for dogs, developed according to OIE standards, are nowadays available."
