A New Brighton family is warning other Minnesota families and pet owners after its 10-month-old puppy died from ingesting blue-green algae.


[The puppy's] owner said she recently took the lab-golden mix with her to her family's cabin just outside of Alexandria for a weekend at Red Rock Lake.

{The woman] said she grew up going to lakes throughout the state. She's a seasoned Minnesotan and knows what dangers to look for before letting her dog in the water. She said the lake water was so clear that weekend, she had no reason not to let the dog play in it.

However, within half an hour of getting out, she said [the puppy] started getting sick and having seizures. He died on the way to the emergency veterinarian.

The woman said although it's hard for her to re-live [her dog's] death by talking about it, she wants to warn other pet owners that just because the lake water is clear, that doesn't mean it's safe.

According to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA), blue-green algae typically appear in late summer and early fall, when the water is at its warmest.

"It's more pronounced in smaller, shallower lakes because they'll warm up a little bit quicker and these are very potent toxins," researcher Steve Heiskary said.

The woman brought lake water samples and tissue samples from [her dog] to the MPCA, which confirmed he died from blue-green algae exposure. Specifically, the danger comes from microcystin, a byproduct of the algae. Dogs can get it by drinking the lake water or ingesting it by licking the toxic scum off of their coats.

Dogs and small children can be at risk, according to the MPCA, because they wade in shallow shorelines where the algae tend to accumulate. Testing for the toxin is tricky, because it comes and goes in the water naturally. There's no way to treat it.

The Prior Lake-Spring Lake Watershed recently issued a notice that blue-green algae were spotted on Lower Prior Lake on Harbor Bay. As of [Sun 14 Jun 2015], there haven't been any reports of illness.

In 2014, 3 dogs in Minnesota died from ingesting the algae, according to the MPCA.

It seems that the while the dog in the article above is deceased, there is another dog mentioned in other sources that is still quite ill

There are a number of blue-green algae, many of which are toxic, frequently resulting in rapid death for animals.

Blue-green algae, also known as Cyanobacteria, are a group of photosynthetic bacteria that many people refer to as "pond scum." Blue-green algae are most often blue-green in color, but can also be blue, green, reddish-purple, or brown. Blue-green algae generally grow in lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams when the water is warm and enriched with nutrients like phosphorus or nitrogen.

When environmental conditions are just right, blue-green algae can grow very quickly in number. Most species are buoyant and will float to the surface, where they form scum layers or floating mats. When this happens, we call this a "blue-green algae bloom." Blue-green algae blooms generally occur between mid-June and late September, although in rare instances, blooms have been observed in winter, even under the ice.

Many different species of blue-green algae occur in Minnesota waters, but the most commonly detected include _Anabaena_ sp, _Aphanizomenon_ sp, _Microcystis_ sp, and _Planktothrix_ sp. It is not always the same species that blooms in a given water body, and the dominant species present can change over the course of the season.

Blue-green algal toxins are naturally produced chemical compounds that sometimes are produced inside the cells of certain species of blue-green algae. These chemicals are not produced all of the time and there is no easy way to tell when blue-green algae are producing them and when they are not. When the cells are broken open, the toxins may be released. Sometimes this occurs when the cells die off naturally and they break open as they sink and decay in a lake or pond. Cells may also be broken open when the water is treated with chemicals meant to kill algae, and when cells are swallowed and mixed with digestive acids in the stomachs of people or animals.

Typical clinical signs in dogs exposed to blue-green algae include seizures, vomiting, and/or diarrhea after contact with surface water. Although the water appeared clear, if a "bloom" is just starting, it may be difficult to see any sheen, an early indication of blue-green algae formation. Some forms of blue-green algae may start forming slightly below the surface, and may not be visible, but are just as toxic.

One toxic alga frequently involved in illness and deaths is _Microcystis aeruginosa_, a single-celled blue green alga, or cyanobacterium, that occurs naturally in surface waters. _Microcystis_ can proliferate to form dense blooms and mats under certain conditions. Many variants of these cyanobacteria produce multiple toxins, including the potent liver toxin, microcystin. When _Microcystis_ die, their cells break open, releasing the toxin microcystin into the water. Ingestion of water or algal cells containing microcystin has produced adverse effects in fish, dogs, cats, livestock, and humans. Sometimes the mats and the sheen of the organisms are visible on the surface of the water, if it is a pond. In larger bodies of water, such as large lakes, it may be more difficult or impossible to see the sheen or the mat of accumulation.

People swimming in dense _Microcystis_ blooms have experienced irritation such as skin rashes, burns, and blistering of the mouth. Ingestion or inhalation of water containing dense bloom material may cause vomiting, nausea, headaches, diarrhea, pneumonia, and fever. Ingestion of significant levels of the toxin microcystin can cause liver damage and dysfunction in humans and animals. No deaths from ingestion of microcystins have been reported in humans in the US, however Brazil has reported human deaths. Dogs, wildlife, and livestock have died following exposure to this toxin.

_Microcystis_ blooms typically thrive in warm, turbid, and slow-moving waters. The blooms with the highest biomass occur in waters that are high in nitrogen or phosphorus (eutrophic waters). _Microcystis_ also require sufficient light intensity to conduct photosynthesis, which results in blooms.

The most common route of exposure to microcystin is drinking water followed by recreational exposures and food supplements. Typical water treatment processes do not fully remove microcystin that might be present in drinking water supplies stored in reservoirs. Swimming and playing in water that contains, or recently contained, _Microcystis_ blooms is another common exposure route. Children have the highest risk of exposure since they tend to unintentionally ingest water while swimming. Microcystin can move through the aquatic food web, exposing fish and shellfish, as well as the people that consume them. Microcystin does not remain in edible fish and shellfish tissues for more than a few weeks. However, people that frequently consume sport fish caught from a water body that supports _Microcystis_ blooms have a higher risk of exposure. Dogs can ingest large amounts of _Microcystis_ cells when they clean their coats after playing in water. Livestock, wildlife, and dogs are exposed through drinking water and containing _Microcystis_ or ingesting algal mats.
