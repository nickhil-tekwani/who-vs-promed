The Illinois Department of Public Health reports 2 new, laboratory-confirmed cases of legionnaires' disease at an Illinois Veterans Home in Quincy. After learning of the 2 cases, staff removed faucets from the residents' rooms right away and collected water samples. Both residents are back at the Illinois Veterans Home in Quincy and are doing well.

The veterans home just completed an extensive renovation of its plumbing systems last year [2017] after a 2015 legionnaires' disease outbreak. Renovations included construction of a water treatment plant that provided better quality water. The Illinois department of Veterans Affairs says it will continue to test and treat its water for harmful bacteria, and they will also continue to work with the Illinois Department of Health and CDC.

Illinois General Assembly Senate Republican Staff member Rachel Bold released the following statement in response to the new cases: "Governor Rauner continues to work with IDPH Director Nirav Shah, IDVA Director Erica Jeffries, the CDC and the Adams County Health Department to provide for the health and safety of the skilled nursing home's residents and staff. Engineering staff at the home acted quickly, immediately implementing prescribed contingency responses -- completing thermal eradication and other measures to protect residents and staff. Our goal must be to put politics aside and work together to keep our veterans safe and healthy." State Senator Tom Cullerton (D-Villa Park) is outraged at news of 2 more confirmed cases of Legionnaires' disease at the Illinois Veterans Home at Quincy.

[Many veterans' homes are managed and funded by state governments (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_soldiers%27_home). The Illinois Veterans Home in Quincy, Illinois, is responsible for providing economical and quality long-term care for veterans and their spouses, which includes domiciliary care, intermediate care, and skilled healthcare (http://www.quincyivh.org). According to its website, the Illinois Veterans Home in Quincy is one of the larger and older veterans homes in the country, with nearly 450 residents and over 25 buildings that house a post office, bank, assembly hall, guest house, mini post exchange, chapel, animal park, museum, and television station; water, sewer, gas, electricity, telephone, and data networks are owned and maintained by the Veterans Home.

In 2015, ProMED-mail posted a report on 53 cases of legionnaires' disease, including 12 deaths, at the Quincy veterans home, plus another 4 patients with legionnaires' disease in Quincy who were said to be not connected to the veterans home (Legionellosis - USA (15): (IL) fatal, veterans home, update, RFI 20150924.3668124).

The outbreak recurred in 2016, when 2 cases were reported in July 2016, less than a month after a nearly USD 5 million state-of-the-art water treatment plant and delivery system was unveiled at this facility (Legionellosis - USA (04): (IL) vet home, updated water treatment, new cases, RFI 20160728.4377020).

Again in October 2017, 2 more cases were reported in residents of the Quincy Illinois Veterans Home (ProMED-mail post Legionellosis - USA (17): (IL) vet home, updated water treatment, new cases 20171020.5394079) and a month later another case was reported in a resident of the Illinois Veterans Home (Legionellosis - USA (23): (IL) vet home, updated water treatment, new case, RFI 20171130.5474288).

We have not been told the species of _Legionella_ involved, the results of genotyping the patient and environmental _Legionella_ isolates, or any epidemiological linkages among the patients. More information in this regard would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

Quincy, with a population of 40 633 in 2010, is a city on the Mississippi River and the county seat of Adams County, Illinois, United States (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quincy,_Illinois). - Mod.ML
