I have read the news about meningococcal B meningitis in New Zealand and it's
increasing figures, posted by Mel Brieseman.
I know there is an effective (>84%) and safe vaccine that has been tested in
humans in the origin country and by OMS [Organisacion Mundial de la Salud =
W.H.O.] in Isleland [Iceland?].
To my knowledge more than 40,000,000 doses have been administered (to both
children and adults). The vaccine has eliminated meningoccal disease as a
public health problem in Cuba.
The vaccine is elaborated [manufactured] in Instituto Finlay -La Habana, Cuba-
and it has also been administered in Brasil, Colombia, Argentina, and
Uruguay, among other countries. When it has been administered, the results
were remarkable.
I am sure that the Instituto Finlay is willing to provide more specific
information regarding the meningococcal disease problem.
