Climatic changes, combining high temperatures and rain in some areas, have caused the proliferation of arthropods, potentially transmitting animal diseases. The veterinary services of the Ministry of Agriculture, Water Resources and Fisheries have noted during the current month [August 2022] several cases of the disease called epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) in cattle. The EHD virus infects ruminants, especially deer and elk, and appears also in cattle. Its symptoms are similar to those of bluetongue disease.

EHD virus is not infectious to humans. It appeared for the 1st time in Tunisia and the Maghreb in 2006, causing internal bleedings in the susceptible species. The disease is transmitted by _Culicoides_ during seasons with appropriate climatic conditions (humidity and high temperature), especially in humid and irrigated areas.

The Veterinary Services call upon all breeders to prevent and protect their animals from the vectors by applying the relevant guidelines [included in great detail at the source URL above].

Suspected cases should be reported to the regional offices of 'agricultural development', specifying the observed symptoms of the disease (high temperature, redness of the membranes, swelling of the head).

Owners should resort to the nearest private veterinarian when the 1st symptoms appear, to confirm the animal's disease state while refraining from self-medication, as this may challenge the animal's health and safety.

[Epizootic haemorrhagic disease (EHD) is caused by a virus of the family Reoviridae, genus _Orbivirus_, which can infect most wild and domestic ruminants. It was considered an emerging disease in cattle, added to the WOAH list of notifiable diseases in May 2008, following outbreaks in 4 Mediterranean countries (Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Israel). Morbidity and mortality may be as high as 90% in white-tailed deer (as manifested seasonally in North America). However, severity varies depending on the year and geographical location. There are 8 or more serotypes, and Ibaraki virus is a member of the EHD virus (EHDV) serogroup (serotype 2). EHDV demonstrates immunological cross-reactivity with the bluetongue virus group. The virus is transmitted by biological vectors, usually biting midges of the genus _Culicoides_, after an external extrinsic period of 10-14 days. In temperate regions, infection is most common in the late summer and autumn during peak vector population, while infection occurs throughout the year in tropical regions. Parts of the above and additional information on EHD are available in WOAH's disease card at https://tinyurl.com/ycv2bgtj.

During the 1st occurrence of EHD in Tunisia, in 2006, virus serotype 6 was identified in affected cattle. This occurred almost simultaneously with Morocco and Algeria, where cattle were affected. Events of EHD recurred in Tunisia's cattle during the fall months of 2015 and 2021. On 23 and 25 Oct 2021, the deaths of 2 deer (female and male; Barbary deer?) were reported from the El Feidja National Park near Ghardimaou town. EHD was said to be diagnosed (ProMED-MENA 20211031.8699333).

EHD should be differentiated from bluetongue (BT) disease, which affects sheep and cattle. Most of the (27) BT virus serotypes cause viraemia in cattle with very mild or no clinical signs; BTV-8 is exceptional, causing clinical disease in cattle.

Information from knowledgeable sources in the area on the definitive diagnosis (EHD or BT) and the serotype of the virus behind the current cattle disease in Tunisia will be appreciated.

Both live modified and inactivated vaccines have been developed to control Ibaraki disease in cattle in Japan. Ibaraki disease is caused by a strain of EHDV-2.

We are not aware of the availability of a commercial vaccine against the serotypes known to circulate in the Mediterranean basin. - Mod.AS
