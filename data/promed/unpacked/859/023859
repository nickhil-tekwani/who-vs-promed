Poliovirus weekly update as of 16 Dec 2020, World Health Organization

New wild poliovirus isolates reported this week:
AFP cases: 0
Environment: 3
Others: 0

New cVDPV isolates reported this week:
AFP cases: 68
Environment: 3
Others: 13

Headlines:
- The EB [executive board] reports on both polio eradication and polio transition planning/post-certification are now available at https://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/EB148/B148_22-en.pdf. These reports will help inform the discussions on polio eradication by Member States at the upcoming EB to be held on [18-26 Jan 2021].

- Revision to WHO global poliovirus containment guidance: Following a Containment Advisory Group (CAG) recommendation, revision to WHO's chief guidance document for poliovirus containment -- GAPIII -- has been initiated. The aim is to harmonize GAPIII requirements with other relevant biorisk management standards and CAG recommendations, through wide stakeholder engagement. Comments are still being received; contact <hsingh@who.int> for more information. The revised draft is expected to be ready for publication in Q1 2021, with critical review and endorsement of the document by CAG to follow.

- New online tool to identify and assess potentially infectious material: A Potentially Infectious Materials (PIM) poliovirus identification and assessment digital online tool has been developed to assist all labs to identify samples or collections as PIM and carry out appropriate measures. The tool, to be available in Q1 2021, is to be used in conjunction with WHO's PIM guidance. Thanks to facilities, which helped pilot the tool.

[While the WPV1 is still circulating in Afghanistan (last WPV1 confirmed case week ending 25 Nov 2020) and Pakistan as seen by positive environmental samples week ending 16 Dec 2020, it appears that the newly confirmed cases have been dropping with no newly confirmed cases due to WPV1 (wild poliovirus type 1) in the past 2 weeks.

In contrast, the number of cases of cVDPV (circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus) cases continue to grow rapidly, with 68 newly confirmed cases in the past week, a 4-fold increase in total cases reported during the same time period in 2019, and over twice as many cases for the entire year 2019. One can't but help the observation that the risk of paralytic disease associated with the vaccine is overshadowing the risk of paralytic disease associated with the wild virus. A risk benefit equation that speaks to the need to reassess the current strategy.

Note that the cases reported earlier this week in Sierra Leone have been identified as type 2 VDPVs but are not included in this week's update above.

[2] Sierra Leone: type 2 virus RFI
Date: Mon 14 Dec 2020
Source Relief web [edited]
https://reliefweb.int/report/sierra-leone/sierra-leone-investigates-isolation-poliovirus-type-2


The Ministry of Health and Sanitation wishes to inform the general public that preliminary results from the investigations of children manifesting weakness of the limbs, referred to as "acute flaccid paralysis" (AFP), have led to the isolation of poliovirus type 2 from 3 cases of AFP in Kambia, Tonkolili, and Western Area Rural, respectively.

Stool samples are routinely collected from children manifesting weakness of the limbs and tested in the laboratory to determine the cause and possible origin. Hence, routine samples collected in this process, including from a 26-month-old child that took ill with symptoms of AFP in Kambia, were analyzed at the regional lab in Abidjan and isolated: poliovirus type 2 (PV2).

Further advanced investigations of the isolated samples are underway at the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) in Johannesburg, South Africa, to verify the initial results, determine their source and origin to determine if they are the cause of the paralysis in the 3 identified children, and assess if they pose any public health threat, as required by the World Health Organization.

"Further laboratory investigations are going on to determine the type of poliovirus we might be dealing with. However, active case finding for any potential AFP cases in the country is continuing, and additional surveillance measures and community actions are ongoing," says Prof. Alpha T. Wurie, Minister of Health and Sanitation.

The Ministry of Health and Sanitation wishes to urge parents and caregivers to ensure that all children under 5 years receive all their immunizations to protect them against vaccine-preventable diseases including polio.

Sierra Leone, as part of the global polio eradication efforts, continues to strengthen its routine immunization levels and disease surveillance in order to minimise the risk and consequences of any potential polio re-introduction or re-emergence. Sierra Leone has not reported any confirmed polio case since 2010.

Preliminary polio outbreak response actions as required by the International Health Regulations are being instituted by the Sierra Leone health authorities with support from partners. The MoHS has convened emergency meetings at the national level and the affected districts to review the events. Meanwhile, a national Rapid Response Team including MoHS, WHO, and AFENET has been deployed to commence in-depth investigations in the affected communities.

Discussions are also underway for possible emergency Supplemental Immunization Activities (SIAs) should the Johannesburg results confirm poliovirus type 2.

"The ongoing investigation of the polioviruses that have been isolated is of significant interest and importance to Sierra Leone and the global polio eradication efforts. Hence the World Health Organization would ensure that we provide the strongest technical support to the government of Sierra Leone to fully implement the necessary public health measures," says Dr Steven Shongwe, WHO Country Representative in Sierra Leone. "We are, however, pleased that a functional public health surveillance system that this country has built was able to identify these isolates in time to initiate appropriate action," he added.

Polio is a highly infectious viral disease. The virus, which mainly affects children under 5, attacks the brain and spinal cord and can cause total paralysis in the limbs within days of infection and can cause permanent disability and even death.

The virus is transmitted from person-to-person mainly through the faecal-oral route, or less frequently through food or water that is contaminated with the virus. Once the virus has entered the body, usually through the mouth, it multiplies in the throat and intestines and can also enter the bloodstream and spread to the nervous system. Although children are more likely to catch polio, adults, who may carry the virus without displaying symptoms, can help to spread it. Environmental factors including poor sanitation also help spread the virus.

Whilst the MoHS and partners are working to establish the facts about the unfolding events, the Ministry remains committed to prevent and respond to all public health threats to safeguard the health and wellbeing of citizens and residents in Sierra Leone.

[Since the original report (Poliomyelitis update (20): Sierra Leone, cVDPV 20201215.8021230), the virus has been identified as type 2, the most common of the cVDPV serotypes identified globally. More information on the epidemiologic investigation of these cases (age, gender, vaccination history) and laboratory confirmation of virus genetic origin would be greatly appreciated. Are the 3 isolates all part of the same outbreak, or do they have different lineages? Are they Sierra Leone-specific events, or are the virus(es) related to outbreaks in other countries?
