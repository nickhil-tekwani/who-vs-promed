An 11-year-old American quarter horse gelding, and his owner and rider, had worked for years to qualify for the World Series of Team Roping in Las Vegas, finally making that dream a reality by qualifying in 2016. Just before they were set to compete, however, [the gelding] contracted botulism, so [his owner] raced him to the University of California, Davis, veterinary hospital to try to save his life, according to a university release. Botulism had killed one of [the gelding's] stable mates.

"After what happened to our other horses just 2 weeks earlier, we got him to Davis as fast as we could," [the owner] says in the release, recalling 2 other horses in his herd of 25 that were treated for botulism at UC Davis. One didn't survive. [The owner] says [this gelding] looked just as bad as the one that had passed away, so he wasn't optimistic.

[The owner] immediately instituted biosecurity measures at his farm. He determined that the only common factors for those 3 horses were grain and water. The water was from the same well that went to the house, and there were no issues there, so the investigation focused on the grain, the release says. [The owner] feeds grain only to horses that are being ridden, as a treat while they're being saddled or unsaddled. [this gelding] and the 2 other horses were the only horses being ridden at that time, and none of the unridden horses got sick, so a bad batch of grain was determined to be the culprit.

[The owner] was determined to save his horse, as he'd searched a long time to find an equine athlete with the potential to compete at the highest levels of roping. He worked with the UC Davis equine specialists to do everything he could for a positive outcome for [the gelding].

[The gelding] spent 26 days hospitalized for treatment. During that time he received antitoxin plasma and supportive care that included intravenous fluid therapy, anti-inflammatories and vitamin E, the release states. He was unable to stand without help, so faculty, staff and students at the large animal clinic used the facility's large animal lift to help him stand. Once standing, John was disconnected from the lift so he could move around freely and lie down when he wanted.

[The gelding] gradually became stronger. On the 22nd day of his hospitalization, he stood unassisted for the 1st time, though he needed minor assistance from the lift until day 26, when he stood unassisted again, the release says. His care team decided at that time to send [the gelding] home to recover in a larger space than the stalls in the hospital's intensive care unit.

[The owner] took [the gelding] home, but the 1st day he couldn't stand on his own, so [he] used a lift attached to his tractor to get [the gelding] up. [The gelding] stayed up all day, but the next morning [the owner] found him down again. However, when [the gelding] heard [the owner] start the tractor, he got up on his own, the release says.

"I think he thought, 'Well if you're going to hoist me up with the tractor again, I'll just stand up,'" he says.

It took about 3 months, until February 2017, for [the gelding] to gain his weight and strength back. [The owner] took him to a roping competition in Arizona, but [the gelding] wasn't quite ready to compete. Realizing the horse needed more rest, [the owner] took off [the gelding's] shoes and let him out to pasture for 4 months, according to the release.

In June, [the owner] thought he'd try competing with [the gelding again] again. He took the horse to a competition and [the gelding] was back to his old self, winning the event. Since then, [the owner] and [the gelding] have qualified for the World Series of Team Roping, and [the owner] is very excited.

"It was a big deal for me to have UC Davis save him," [the owner] says in the release. "I was ecstatic when he came back as good as he did. They did a good job on him at Davis."

[We apologize for the late notice on this remarkable recovery.

Botulism is caused by a bacterium in the _Clostridium_ family, _Clostridium botulinum_. Two other _Clostridia_ also can cause botulism, _C. barati_ and _C. butyricum_. Tetanus is also caused by a member of the _Clostridium_ family, _C. tetani_, but the signs of tetanus and botulism are very different. Both organisms produce toxins for attacking the nervous system, but tetanus causes the animal to be rigid while botulism produces profound and often flaccid weakness.

The earliest obvious signs of botulism involve the nerves controlling the horse's ability to swallow and move the tongue. The horse may have trouble holding his head up, and anal and tail tone are often decreased.

As the disease advances, the horse gets progressively weaker and has trouble supporting his weight. Eventually the horse goes down, is unable to rise on his own, and paralysis spreads to the muscles he uses to breathe-the diaphragm and muscles between the ribs (intercostals). If the disease runs its natural course, the horse will die either of suffocation or when the heart muscle fails.

Large animals such as horses may be exposed to botulism when an animal such as rodent or rabbit is unfortunately baled into the hay. Usually the producer is unaware of this until there is an incident with the animals. This can happen with some situations where an animal is dead in a body of water but there are many factors to consider for this to happen.

It is less common for botulism to occur in grain, but it is not impossible as this story clearly indicates. How the grain became contaminated we are not told. It may have been an unfortunate animal or part of an animal in the grain, and spores remained even after the carcass was removed.

Horses are some of the most sensitive animals to botulism. There is a vaccine for it which must be initially given 3 times, then an annual booster. It is also specifically against one strain of botulism. The name of the vaccine is BotVx B.

The recovery of the horse is great news and clearly took some focused time and effort.

Congratulations to the gelding for his recovery and good luck to the gelding and his owner in journeys together.
