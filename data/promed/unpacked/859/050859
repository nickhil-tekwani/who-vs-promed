Encephalitis disorder has killed 21 people, mostly children, and
affected some 200 others at a remote part of Bangladesh over the past
week, health officials said on Sunday [11 Nov 2007]. But they said
they were yet to confirm what caused the disease. At least 30 people
are still in hospitals, with fever and vomiting.

The authorities employed several medical teams to control the
disease, which was earlier branded as a mystery illness when it 1st
broke out at Goainghat near Sylhet town, 350 km (219 miles) northeast
of the capital Dhaka.

"The preliminary diagnosis revealed that it (disease) was a type of
encephalitis, inflammation of the brain," Mahmudur Rahman, head of a
diagnostic team told Reuters.

Rahman said the patients were severely malnourished, with limited
physical resistance against the disease. He, however, could not say
why the patients were so malnourished.

He said Bangladesh's International Epidemiology Research Centre was
closely working with the Center for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) in the United States to determine which bacteria or virus had
caused the disease.

Encephalitis killed 23 people and infected dozens in Bangladesh in
2004. Before the diagnosis, many feared that the disease was bird flu.

Bird flu in Bangladesh has forced authorities to cull nearly 268 000
chickens and destroy nearly 3 million eggs since March this year
[2007].

Authorities said there was no case of human infection.

[The information is too vague to suggest the etiology of this
disease, although Japanese encephalitis virus infection might be
suspected. ProMED-mail requests information when it becomes available
from the tests being conducted by the US CDC.
