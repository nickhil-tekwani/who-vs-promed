Whooping Cough Death Toll Rises
----------------------------
A total of 175 children have died of a whooping cough outbreak in Kimatong
Budi county, Equatoria state, according to NGO sources. 2 of the deaths
occurred on Tue, 7 Oct 2003. Almost 1000 suspected cases have been
observed to date, with over 560 this week alone, Ed Walker of Tearfund told
IRIN. He said 860 cases had been confirmed, with most of them under 5 years
of age.
A mass treatment and prevention campaign is being carried out in several
locations around the villages of Chawa, Kimatong, Thurunge, and Kali, with
families being treated once a member has become infected. So far 82 of
those infected have also tested positive for malaria, said Medair, another
NGO.
There has been no NGO presence in the area for 5 years, and there is only
one health facility in operation -- with limited medicines. There are no
laboratory facilities. With chronic malaria (and ongoing rains bringing
further mosquitoes), the almost total lack of healthcare, and no
vaccinations, children were very likely to become infected, warned Els
Stamm, programme coordinator for Medair. Medair and Tearfund are jointly
carrying out treatment and health education programmes in the area.

[The method of pertussis confirmation is not stated, and often whooping
cough is a clinical diagnosis. Not surprisingly, many of the children have
malaria infection as well. - Mod.LL]
