Increase in Dengue Fever Cases Reported in Philippines (Benguet)
----------------------------------------------------------------
BAGUIO: At least 334 individuals in Benguet province were reported to
be suffering from dengue fever even as regional hospitals reported
having admitted 60 new cases of the disease from the city. But the
Department of Health-Cordillera (DOH-CAR) is not yet inclined to
declare an epidemic at this time. Of the 334 dengue cases in Benguet,
232 were reported from the town of Bokod; the remaining 102 were from
the mining town of Mankayan.
No deaths were reported, but numbers of dengue cases are expected to
increase in the coming days, according to Bony Bengwayan, information
officer of the DOH-CAR. In spite of these confirmed cases, the DOH-CAR
has yet to concede that the reported dengue fever cases in Benguet and
Baguio are enough to declare a dengue outbreak in these areas. There
is a standing policy of DOH-CAR that an outbreak will be declared if
at least 10 individuals or more from one barangay are suffering from a
common disease.
Nevertheless, Bengwayan told the Sun Star that a 7-man team from the
Epidemiology Division of DOH-CAR with augmentation from DOH central
office was immediately dispatched to Bokod and Mankayan to gather
blood samples from the suspected dengue patients and were expected to
arrive in Baguio yesterday.
Bengwayan claimed that the upward trend in the number of dengue cases
had been anticipated by the health department, saying that [the
frequency of dengue cases is cyclic; cases increase every 2 or 3
years. "As of now I cannot tell you that the regional office will
declare a dengue outbreak in Benguet and Baguio city," Bengwayan said.
But last Monday, City Health Officer Florence Reyes had hinted at a
possible declaration of a dengue outbreak in the city. This developed
even as Reyes shared Benwayan's belief that the upward trend of dengue
cases was expected.
An initial report gathered by the DOH-CAR revealed that Barangays
Campo Filipino, Lucban, Aurora Hil, City Camp, and Scout Barrio are
infested with _Aedes aegypti_, the dengue fever [vector.

Philippines Update: Cebu Accounts for 25% of Dengue Cases
---------------------------------------------------------
CEBU: Cebu now accounts for 25 percent of dengue cases in the country.
As a result, the Department of Health (DOH) has placed the province on
high-level alert. The number of local children afflicted by the
disease has also risen considerably since May, surpassing numbers of
cases in the National Capital Region (NCR). Health Secretary Manuel
Dayrit said Cebu has now topped NCR with a record of 1300 dengue cases
over the latter's 1200. The nationwide total is 5000.
As of Fri 20 Jul 2001, fatalities from the disease have reached 50.
Dayrit said he has ordered DOH 7 to strengthen the information drive
on preventing contracting the disease and to continue with the fogging
operation. He said the seriously affected areas are Capitol, Nivel
Hills, Barangays Apas and Sitio Banawa, Guadalupe in Cebu city;
Barangay Lawaan in Minglanilla town; Toledo city; and Yati, Liloan. In
the first quarter of this year [2001, at least 26 cases of dengue
fever were reported in Barangay Guadalupe, according to a City Health
Department report. The number was the highest among Cebu city's 80
barangays. The dengue virus is transmitted by the _Aedes aegypti_
mosquito. Symptoms of the disease such as fever, berry-like skin rash,
and swollen glands develop within 3 to 15 days. Internal bleeding may
also develop if the patient is not quickly treated. The epidemic
occurs during the wet season, when mosquitoes have ample breeding
grounds.
Health officials earlier said the key to controlling dengue is the
elimination of the mosquitoes' breeding sites. The disease-carrying
mosquito bites between 4:30 and 8:30 a.m. and between 4:30 and 8:30
p.m. It breeds in stagnant water outside the house, such as in
gutters, tires, and tin cans. [Stagnant generally carries the
meaning of polluted; _Aedes aegypti_ needs clean water that is still,
not flowing - Mod.JW
But regular cleaning should also be done indoors, as mosquito eggs
also thrive in water in a flower vase, collected bottles, and radiator
pads of refrigerators. Collected water in drums and other containers
should always be covered.
In the Cordillera Administrative Region, dengue cases represented a
243 percent increase from the 127 cases recorded this year, compared
to only 37 cases last year. As this situation developed, the DOH-CAR
is recommending that local health units strengthen their information
and education campaign regarding prevention and control of these
diseases.

Increase in Dengue Fever Cases in Phuket, Thailand
--------------------------------------------------
PHUKET: The Phuket Health Office (PHO) has issued its second dengue
fever warning in less than a month. On 12 Jun 2001, the PHO reported
that 55 cases of dengue fever had been recorded since the beginning of
the year. By 5 Jul 2001, it announced that the figure had risen to 75.
Dr. Boonrieng Chuchaisaengrat, chief of the PHO, told the Gazette, "At
this time of year, from June to August, there is a (greater) risk,
everywhere in Thailand, of getting dengue fever. In Phuket, we have
been able to control the spread of the disease and have yet to have a
fatality from it." Dr. Boonrieng said that the PHO will continue its
campaign to encourage people to rid their surroundings of conditions
in which mosquitoes can breed, especially pools of stagnant water.

So far this year, dengue fever has claimed 79 lives in Thailand.
