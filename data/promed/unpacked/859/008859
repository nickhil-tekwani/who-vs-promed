Fungus strain puts potato crop at risk
--------------------------------------
The potato crop is under severe threat once again from blight with
the emergence of a new strain of the fungus Blue 13 which has arrived
here from Britain where it was 1st detected in 2005. Farmers already
suffering from severe crop losses because of frost and snow were told
yesterday [9 Feb 2010] at the National Potato Conference that the new
strain had spread to many parts of Ireland and may be adapting to
Irish conditions.

Teagasc [Irish Agriculture and Food Development Authority]
researchers Stephen Kildea and Denis Griffin reported their
preliminary findings on the spread of the disease in 2009 when the
wet summer created ideal blight conditions.

They found the Blue 13 strain dominated potato blight populations
along the east coast and had increased in Donegal crops but its
spread was less dramatic than on the east coast. No strain of it was
found in Cork. They warned the phenylamide-based fungicides were
unlikely to provide control and their use should be limited.

[Potato late blight (PLB) is caused by the fungus-like organism
_Phytophthora infestans_ and can cause 100 percent crop loss. The
pathogen can also affect tomato and some other solanaceous crops. PLB
is spread by plant material (including potato seed tubers), wind and
water. Disease management generally relies on fungicide treatments of
seed tubers and crops. Considerable variation in aggressiveness
between different pathogen strains has been observed, but more
virulent strains are emerging frequently.

Where both A1 and A2 mating types of the pathogen are present,
reproduction occurs sexually as well as asexually increasing the
chances of strains with additional fungicide resistances and
increased yield losses to develop. All blight outside Mexico was A1
until in 1976, potatoes were imported into Europe from Mexico to
satisfy shortages. Soon after A2 strains were detected in Europe.

A2 types were 1st identified in the UK in 2005, including the
particularly aggressive A2-Blue13 strain. Blue13 has resistance to
some widely used fungicides (as mentioned above) and is now dominant
and still spreading in the UK (ProMED-mail post 20090406.1332). Its
arrival in Ireland poses the risk of additional crop losses and
increased costs of PLB control for the national potato industry.
