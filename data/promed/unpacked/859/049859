Veterinary scientists have proved an organism long suspected as the cause
of feline infectious anemia (FIA) indeed is the culprit. Along the way,
they have created a diagnostic tool and concluded the bacterial organism is
a mycoplasma, not a Rickkettsiae.
The molecular confirmation that FIA is caused by _Haemobartenella felis_ --
described in an article in the January issue of Veterinary Pathology --
came after a series of studies at the University of Illinois (UI) College
of Veterinary Medicine. Using a technique known as _in situ_ hybridization,
researchers showed a small gene fragment, which they had identified
earlier, linked positively to _H. felis_ located on red blood cells taken
from experimentally infected cats.
"These organisms are teeny tiny parasites," said Joanne B. Messick, a UI
professor of veterinary pathology. "For years they were thought to be
rickettsial, but our laboratory and at least 2 other laboratories now show
that they are not rickettsial. They are mycoplasma organisms."
Rickettsiae are gram-negative, disease-causing intracellular parasitic
bacteria whose transmission has been linked to ectoparasite vectors.
Mycoplasma organisms are tough, evasive bacteria lacking a cell wall. They
are the smallest free-living cells known to exist, and their vector is
uncertain, though believed to be the same as Rickettsiae, Messick said. For
years, suspected cases of FIA have been treated with antibiotics. Cats can
become very anemic as red-blood-cell counts plummet. Even if symptoms
disappear, the organism remains present. The prevalence of the disease
--lacking a diagnostic tool -- has been impossible to determine.
Messick and colleagues, including UI veterinary student Linda Marie Berent,
initially developed a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) assay, then used it
to see if it could detect _H. felis_ in infected cats.
"Dr. Berent has used the PCR assay to answer some questions related to
whether cats remain carriers after infection and to prove the clinical
disease is caused by _H. felis_," Messick said.
The UI technique will help veterinarians better grasp the scope of FIA
infection, she said. It also will help researchers find the carrier and
identify risk factors associated with chronic infection. Once the genes
involved in disease activation are isolated, she said, a vaccine could be
made. She will discuss her lab's findings and the implications during a
seminar 25-28 May 2000 at the 18th Annual American College of Veterinary
Internal Medicine Forum in Seattle.
"In the cat population, I believe the disease is a bigger problem than
people recognize," she said. "It has been too difficult to diagnose. It's a
really fascinating organism. It is very transient. It goes into hiding very
easily. Where does it go?"
Long-term infections with mycoplasmas relate to rheumatic diseases such as
arthritis, she said. "However, the long-term consequences of a cat living
with _H.felis_, even if inactive, are unknown."
