[In the case of Swine Vesicular Disease (SVD), laboratory studies are
important for diagnosis because it can be difficult to clinically
distinguish pigs with SVD from those having Foot and Mouth Disease. The
implications of an outbreak of FMD are much greater than an outbreak of
SVD. Hopefully, this is an isolated incident because the animal health
authorities in Northern Italy must be up to their proverbial necks dealing
with the concurrent Avian Influenza outbreak. - Mod.PC
