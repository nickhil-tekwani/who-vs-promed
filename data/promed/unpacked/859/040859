'Ojo de Gallo' affecting coffee plantations in Costa Rica
----------------------------------------------------------
Coffee plantations that are located more than 1400 meters [4593 feet]
above sea level are being affected by a fungus known as 'ojo de
gallo,' which has prompted the Institute of Farming Research and
Extension to request that all coffee growers spray their crops that
exceed this altitude limit.

The spray to be used is a non-systemic compound with a fungicide
action that is most effective when used against soil based diseases.
It is already used to control another disease known as rhizoctonia
that can be found in rice, potatoes, vegetables as well as being
found in vegetable seeds, cotton, sugar canes and beets and various
other plants.

Along with the use of the spray, farmers are recommended to start
unshading their plants, clean out the weeds and prune the plants.

Ojo de gallo affects the leaves of the coffee plants forcing both the
leaves and the berries or beans to fall off of the plants and if not
checked, has the potential to destroy a large amount of crops.

[Ojo de gallo ("Rooster's eye," American coffee leaf spot disease) is
caused by the fungus _Mycena citricolor_ which is found in
subtropical and tropical America. The pathogen is parasitic on many
forest trees causing, for example, leaf spots and cankers, and at
least 150 host species are known. _M. citricolor_ is naturally
present in virgin forests from where it is thought to have spread to
coffee. Ojo de gallo is a major disease in higher altitude coffee
plantations in Latin America. The disease causes annual losses in
Costa Rica of several million dollars with up to 75 percent yield
loss reported in some areas in the past.

Symptoms on coffee are brown spots with a yellow halo on leaves and
berries causing them to drop off prematurely. Defoliated trees
eventually die. Disease development is favoured by cool, moist
conditions. The pathogen is spread by splashing rain or mechanical
means including animals and human activities. Although it does not
spread rapidly, it can be highly destructive and, once established,
might be impossible to eliminate because of its wide host range.

No real resistance to ojo de gallo has been found in coffee, although
some cultivars appear to be more susceptible than others. Cultural
methods, including orchard sanitation and the regulation of the
amount of shade, are used to reduce losses. Disease management is
costly and mainly relies on eradicant fungicides. Research on
biocontrol using bacterial strains is in progress. This fungus is a
serious quarantine risk for coffee growing areas in other parts of
the world.

_M. citricolor_ is of special interest as a bioluminescent fungus.
Its bioluminescence is based on luciferin reacting with an enzyme,
luciferase, causing the luciferin to oxidise with emission of light.
The biological function of this phenomenon in fungi is unknown, but
it has been suggested that it may help to attract insects which then
disperse the fungal spores. Bioluminescent fungi are of scientific
interest because of the potential of genes associated with
bioluminescence as molecular or biological markers.

The diseases referred to above as rhizoctonia are caused by
_Thanatephorus cucumeris_ (previously _Rhizoctonia solani_). This is
a ubiquitous soilborne fungus, which causes damping-off, root rot,
basal stem root (foot rot), and fruit rot in a large number of crops.
