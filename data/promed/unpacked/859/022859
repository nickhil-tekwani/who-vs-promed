Around 17 million chickens have been culled in Iran so far, due to the recent outbreak of avian flu, the chairman of the board of directors at Tehran's Union of Producers of Egg-Laying Chicken said.

Nasser Nabipour added that almost all the provinces across the country, except Semnan and Khorasan Razavi, are now dealing with the deadly virus.

According to the official, the permit for importing 20 000 tons of eggs has been issued and so far 50-60 tons have been imported from Turkey, Mehr News Agency reported.

This is while Deputy Agriculture Minister Ali Akbar Mehrfard earlier told the news agency that a shipment of 130 000 tons of eggs had been imported from Turkey and were being distributed in the domestic market.

"Turkey has increased egg prices from USD 22 to USD 28 within 24 hours of exporting eggs to Iran," he said.

Nabipour hoped that imports would lead to a decline in the rising egg prices in the Iranian market.

According to CBI's latest report, egg prices marked a 9 percent hike during the week to [22 Dec 2017] compared to the previous week and a 53.7 percent rise compared with last year's [2016] corresponding week, reaching 126 000-175 000 rials [about USD 3.49-4.85] for each tray of 30 eggs.

The price has reportedly reached 210 000 rials [about USD 5.82] in some markets.

Iranian poultry farms are hit by avian flu every year around this time. The H5N8 strain of bird flu infecting Iranian farms is deadly for poultry, but according to World Health Organization, although human infection with the virus cannot be excluded, the likelihood is low.

The recent outbreak is said to have inflicted losses worth over 20 trillion rials [more than about USD 554 million] on production units so far.

This year [2017], the government has allocated 1 trillion rials [about USD 27.7 million] as compensation to chicken farmers for the massive losses caused by the recent outbreak of avian flu across the country.

[According to a previous report by the same media source, the avian influenza epizootic described had affected, up to 25 Dec 2017, 4 provinces in Iran (Qazvin, Tehran, Alborz, and East Azerbaijan), and the number of culled birds had reached 16 million (see 20171225.5522665). According to the current, 6-day more recent report, at present all of Iran's provinces across the country, except Semnan and Khorasan Razavi, are affected and the number of culled birds (poultry) has risen to 17 million. There are 31 provinces in Iran (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Iran).

In the previous post, we assumed that the event is caused by HPAI H5N8, similarly to the previous HPAI H5N8 event there which, according to its official OIE reports, started 11 Nov 2016. In its 6th follow-up ("final") report, submitted to the OIE [Mon 1 May 2017], the reporting authority included the following epidemiological comment:
"No further cases/outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza have been identified by [Mon 1 May 2017] in the whole territory of Iran. Final cleaning and disinfection of the last outbreak was completed on [Mon 30 Jan 2017] and the event was closed based on the surveillance that was carried out in accordance with Articles 10.4.27. to 10.4.33 during a 3-month period. Therefore, Iran complies with Article 10.4.3 of the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code (2016) and declares itself free from infection with avian influenza viruses with effect from [Mon 1 May 2017]." (see at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=21618).

The lab-confirmed identity of the current causative agent and indeed the very factuality and accuracy of the information above on such a significant event are yet to be verified by the pending OIE notification.
