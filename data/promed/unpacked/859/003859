BLACK GILL SYNDROME, SHRIMP - USA (SOUTH CAROLINA) (02)

The description of the "black gill/black spot" outbreak appears to be the
apostome ciliate _Synophrya_. The apostome ciliates are intimately
intertwined with the crustacean molting cycles. They range from
ectosymbionts to endoparasites (like this one). The literature is not
extensive, but I can provide references if needed. Synophrya is found
walled-off in the gills, and melanization causes the black gill. This
apostome can also carve tunnels in the shrimp exoskeleton, forming lattices
under the exoskeleton. In crabs, such as the blue crab, they occur only in
the gills. The life cycle is well documented; see articles by PC
Bradbury (research in North Carolina).
Other conditions leading to "black spot" are melanosis, which occurs in
shrimp a few hours after harvest through an enzymatic reaction (not unlike
fruit darkening).
Other protozoans like _Thelohania_, a microsporidian, cause the tissues to
whiten, thus emphasizing any black spots. Additionally, a bopyrid isopod
(on one gill) is a black parasite located under the gill cover. It can
become quite large. Some spots may also be due to various bacterial and
viral agents.
As with all diseases, parasitized organisms that are environmentally
stressed demonstrate a higher mortality rate.
