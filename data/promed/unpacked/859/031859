A patient of Congo virus expired during treatment at Peshawar's Hayatabad Medical Complex [Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province], ARY News reported on Tuesday [3 Nov 2015]. The fresh victim of the deadly fever was a woman, age 26, from Afghanistan. The fresh death increased the death toll by Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in Pakistan, to 24.

According to the hospital administration, the number of the deaths by Congo fever in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has reached to 12 -- including 2 Afghan nationals and 10 from Peshawar and Bannu districts of the province. Another 32 patients of Congo virus have been admitted in hospitals.

In other parts of Pakistan, 6 patients of the disease died in Quetta and other parts of Balochistan [province]. Still 150 patients of the deadly fever have been admitted at various hospitals of the province. The Congo fever has also claimed 6 lives in Karachi [Sindh province] including a woman from Defence area of the metropolis.

The Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus, commonly known as Congo fever, is a widespread tickborne viral disease that is endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East and Asia.

[The incidence of CCHF in Pakistan is widespread in the country and there are many more cases noted in the report above than ProMED-mail has received this year (2015). Several of these CCHF cases are ex Afghanistan, as is the case reported above. The circumstances under which the patient above acquired her CCHF virus infection are not stated. It could have been via tick bite or via exposure to the blood of an infected animal. From the above report, it seems unlikely that she was infected from close contact with an infected individual, as most of these cases of transmission occur in health care facilities. Implementation of the WHO protocol in treatment of these patients is prudent to avoid nosocomial infections.

The virus can cause severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent. The virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp ticks or through contact with infected human blood or animal blood and tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Exposure in health care facilities can also occur, which is why there is concern for the health care workers who are in contact with patients.

The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days.

CCHF virus is a tickborne virus in the genus _Nairovirus_, family _Bunyaviridae_.
