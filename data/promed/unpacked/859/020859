[The 1st case of contagious equine metritis (CEM) was diagnosed in
1977 near Newmarket in the UK. Since then it spread first to the
United States and then to several parts of Europe and other
countries. A good summary of the clinical disease, epidemiology and
its diagnosis can be found in Contagious equine metritis - USA (04):
(TX) 20090116.0178 or at Iowa State's Center for Food Safety and
Public Health at
<http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/contagious_equine_metritis.pdf>

A previous OIE report on 5 Mar 2010 indicated that a horse with no
clinical signs, residing in Devon in the Southwest of England, was
identified as positive for CEM. The report indicates that "the
stallion was being routinely tested for Taylorella equigenitalis
(CEMO) prior to the mating season, and found to be positive. Previous
test on 21 Jan 2010 was negative. Horse originated from another
Member State of the European Union."

Additionally, the horse identified as positive in the United Arab
Emirates in November of 2009 was exported from the United Kingdom.
Finally, according to the OIE WAHID database, there was a 7-year-old
non-thoroughbred mare residing in Buckinghamshire, also tested
positive for CEM last October. - Mod.PC]
