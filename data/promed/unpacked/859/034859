[1] Cholera - Somalia (Lower Shabelle Province)

Watery diarrhea breaks out in the Somali capital Mogadishu. Many children
have been admitted to Banadir Maternal hospital in Mogadishu. A 7 year old
girl died from the disease in Banadir hospital on 28 Feb 2007.
The general director of Banadir hospital, Dr Abdirizak, told Shabelle that
a large number of patients with watery diarrhea were brought to the
hospital. [He added that medicines in the hospital are scarce] "and people
who have been beset by the disease are increasingly admitted to the hospital."
The disease is believed to have claimed the lives of hundreds of children
in the southern and central provinces of Somalia. At least 25 children,
most of them under the age of 5, died of the watery diarrhea in different
settlements and villages in Afgoi district, 30 km. (19 miles) south of the
capital, on Tue 27 Feb 2007, while a larger number of children were ailing
from the disease.

Period covered by this cholera interim final report: 17 Oct 2006-31 Jan 2007
For the past 2 decades, Sierra Leone has had a history of waterborne
diseases such as diarrhea, vomiting, dysentery, and cholera. The country
has been experiencing heavy rains that have caused serious flooding in
several low lands and river communities for a number of years. This has led
to contamination of streams and wells as they become filled with
uncollected garbage and effluent from sewages, thus exacerbating the
incidence of waterborne diseases as a consequence. This has led to loss of
lives in several parts of the country.
The only available medical services are government hospitals, health
centers, and consultations given by medical practitioners who are
responsible for all or part of public health facilities. Most of these
services are inaccessible to the majority of the Sierra Leone population.
This has led to serious health hazards for more than 60 per cent of the
population, many of whom are already suffering from other socio-economic
conditions such as acute poverty and disability.
At least 1746 cases and 170 deaths were recorded in different hospitals,
mobile outlets, and public health units (PHUs) from Freetown, Lungi, and
Kambia.
As the cholera situation increased, referral hospitals are at the very end
of [their] resources. In addition, diarrhea cases have almost exhausted
their supplies. To support the Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MoH&S),
the Sierra Leone Red Cross Society (SLRCS) worked at community level,
setting up emergency posts with the MoH&S referral facilities and
supporting two-thirds of referral facilities in Freetown with rehydration
fluids.

John Mujarugamba who is in charge of social affairs at Tabagwe sector,
Nyagatare district, told Rwandans who returned from Tanzania on Saturday
[24 Feb 2007], to improve their hygiene [and keep their surroundings clean]
to avoid catching cholera, [which has recently claimed several lives in the
sector. Among other measures, the official suggested] constructing
temporary pit latrines.
Majarugamba was speaking after the monthly community clean-up exercise
(Umuganda), which was carried out at the returnees' camp.
