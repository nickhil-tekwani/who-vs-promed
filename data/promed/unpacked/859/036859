Thai officials are scouring Bangkok for the source of the cholera outbreak
that has struck Hong Kong tourists but warn it could lie far off the
regular tourist trail.
Permanent Secretary of Health Dr. Prokorm Vuthipongse said information from
suffers was vital. "From what we can tell the Hong Kong tour groups
involved were give free time at the end of their tours in Bangkok. They
wandered around doing their own thing and this is were I think the trouble
has started as people went to markets and unlicensed vendors. We believe
the tourist sites are no problem," Dr Prokorm said.
The latest suspected Thai cholera victim is a 24-year-old man who was part
of a fourth tour group struck down with the disease, and could take the
total to 29 cases. He returned from Thailand on Sunday and notified health
teams at Kai Tak airport of vomiting and diarrhea. His fellow travellers -
another 35 people from the tour group from the same travel agency - are
still being closely monitored.
After earlier denials cholera was a problem in the kingdom, Thai
authorities are now checking to see whether a mild strain of the disease is
responsible for soaring numbers of severe diarrhea sufferers.
Ten people [in Thailand have died and more than 1,400 have fallen victim
to acute
symptoms amid hotter-than-usual weather.

A related press release follows (edited):

Residents around Wat Sai floating Market are dismayed by a recent report
that 25 Hong Kong visitors contacted cholera on tours to the market. They
say nobody living there has suffered from severe diarrhea.
Many believe Hong Kong is trying to damage Thai tourism, since Thailand is
now promoting the Amazing Thailand campaign and the baht depreciation has
attracted a lot of foreigners.
