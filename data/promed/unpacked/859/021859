Uganda green-lights Ebola vaccine trials
----------------------------------------
Uganda's health minister announced yesterday [26 Oct 2022] that officials will evaluate 3 Sudan Ebola vaccine candidates in the coming weeks, and she revealed that healthcare workers are already testing some new treatment options.

Currently, there are no approved treatments for the more rare Sudan Ebola strain that Uganda is battling in 7 of its west central regions, including the capital city Kampala. Plans to test vaccines and treatments appear to be similar to strategies used to test countermeasures against Zaire Ebola in in West Africa and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).

Trial plan targets contacts of 150 cases
----------------------------------------
In comments on the status of the outbreak yesterday [26 Oct 2022], reported by the government's media center, Jane Ruth Aceng Ocero, MBChB, MPH, said the 3 Sudan Ebola vaccines are from Oxford University in the United Kingdom and Sabin Vaccine Institute and Merck in the United States.

She said the initial plan is to gauge efficacy in primary Ebola contacts within 29 days of exposure, with a goal of immunizing contacts of 150 confirmed Ebola patients, which would be about 3000 contacts. She said the trial plans have been finalized and that trials will likely begin in 2 weeks.

Yesterday [26 Oct 2022] on Twitter, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) welcomed Uganda's vaccine trial announcement. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said involving Uganda's researchers is key to building capacities for safe and effective vaccinations.

He praised the country's progress in battling the virus in the original epicenter, but said rising cases in new geographical areas, including urban areas, is concerning. Tedros added that controlling Ebola in urban areas is complex, requiring coordinated and sustained efforts to interrupt transmission.

Aceng also said the health ministry is testing several promising treatments, including monoclonal antibodies, as well as repurposed drugs such as Remdesivir, a broad-spectrum antiviral, that was donated by the US government. However, she noted that the country only has a few available doses, and that so far, 13 patients have received them and experienced relatively good outcomes. Four patients who were admitted to treatment in critical condition died, which she said emphasized the importance of early identification and treatment.

Two districts are main hot spots
--------------------------------
Currently, the outbreak epicenter is still Mubende and Kassanda districts, where the country's president has restricted movements into and out of the 2 districts. The ministry said today that over the last 24 hours, 12 new Ebola cases have been reported from Kassanda district.

And Ocero today [27 Oct 2022] said health officials are setting up an Ebola treatment unit in Kassanda district.

Currently, the official total on the government's website reflects 109 lab-confirmed cases and 30 deaths. In the early days of the outbreak, officials reported an additional 20 suspected cases, all fatal.

In other developments, among a recent cluster of 15 cases from Kampala, 6 are children from the same family, according to the BBC. The kids were exposed after a relative came to stay, traveling from one of the outbreak's hot spots. The man later died in a Kampala hospital. [https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-63406354]

Also, the WHO's Uganda office said today [27 Oct 2022] that the WHO has deployed 22 cars to support the Ebola response in the greater Kampala area.

["Dr Aceng says 6 health workers who became infected after treating patients are also among those who recently died. Kampala is the country's economic hub and if Ebola spreads fast there, there is a greater risk of the virus spreading to other countries." (https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-63406354)

"This morning, @WHO has deployed 22 cars to strengthen #EbolaOutbreak case investigation, contact tracing & risk comm in Greater #Kampala. This support is in addition to the 18 KCCA cars already fueled by #WHO & is aimed at preventing the transmission of the disease in the region."

[Helen Branswell tweet (Twitter @HelenBranswell):
1. "The #Ebola Sudan outbreak in Uganda is now the 9th largest Ebola outbreak on record, with 135 confirmed and probable cases, and 52 confirmed and probable deaths. These data are current to [26 Oct 2022], which was the 37th day (i.e. just over 5 weeks) since the outbreak was declared.
2. As I've said a number of times, the #Ebola outbreak in Uganda got quite big, quite fast. There were 2 dozen previous outbreaks that didn't get to 100 cases. The Ugandan Ministry of Health continues to only report confirmed cases. Add 20 probables to their cases & deaths." - Mod.LK]

Contact tracers and village health teams take on Ebola in Uganda
----------------------------------------------------------------
Since an Ebola outbreak was declared in Uganda on 20 Sep 2022, health assistant Nyangoma Kirrungi has been on the frontline of the country's response day in and day out, working as a contact tracer in Madudu sub-county, one of the areas affected by the outbreak.

With support from World Health Organization (WHO) and partners, the Ugandan Ministry of Health has trained and deployed around 300 contact tracers like Kirrungi, who play a critical role as the country looks to curb the spread of the disease.

As part of surveillance team, Kirrungi follows up an average of 40 contacts a day. "I work closely with the investigation unit," she explains. "Once they record a confirmed case of Ebola, my team and I go to the field to follow up with the patient's contacts to ensure that they are symptom-free and then we remain on alert to identify and report symptoms should they develop."

According to Dr Bernard Logouomo, the Ministry of Health Surveillance Team Lead in Mubende District, another Ebola-hit area in the country, contact tracing is key to ending the outbreak. "When the community cooperates in the response and contacts are identified, it becomes easier to contain the disease," he says.

Contact tracers follow a questionnaire designed to assess if a contact has Ebola symptoms. Every contact tracer works with a maximum of 10 village health workers, who are volunteers trained in disease surveillance. Recruited by communities, village health teams help build trust and overcome fears among responders.

In addition to the deployment of contact tracers, 2 hotlines were created for communities to report suspected cases. Investigators follow a list of questions designed to assess the need to dispatch an ambulance or a clinical officer. Once a case in confirmed, a case investigation team establishes a list of contacts, depending on where the patient was likely to have been infected and who they may have met afterwards.

After contacts have been located and screened, village health teams take over to monitor them for any symptoms for 21 days -- the Ebola incubation period. Beyond this important supporting role, these teams also provide invaluable assistance in raising awareness of the disease within their communities. Since the start of the epidemic, the Ministry of Health has trained over 1200 village health team members, also with support from WHO and partners.

With only 25% of contacts followed up every day in the 1st days of the outbreak, contact tracing quickly improved. By mid-October [2022], nearly 94% of 552 contacts were seen and monitored daily for 21 days.

Lydia Nasamba, a market trader and a resident of Madudu, has been a member of a local village health team for more than 8 years. "Every day at 3pm, I go to the sub-county community radio station, where I raise awareness about Ebola -- its symptoms, preventive measures and how to report cases," she says. "After that, I visit the identified contacts in my community to check their health status."

While the contribution of people like Kirrungi and Nasamba is a crucial component of Uganda's Ebola response, they face numerous daily challenges, including a lack of personal protective equipment and reliable transport. Contact tracers are often faced with community members' fear of being stigmatized or isolated in a health facility, which puts people's livelihood at risk. Contacts may also not be home when contact tracers visit them, which makes it difficult to monitor them on daily basis.

With support from the United States Agency for International Development and the Norwegian government, WHO has provided 4 Ebola kits to Mubende Regional Hospital and redeployed 108 technical staff to assist with case management, risk communication, community engagement and laboratory testing.

Back on the ground in Madudu, nothing will deter Kirrungi from the task at hand. "Since I have been involved in the Ebola response, I feel like I am saving lives. I have learned that if all contacts are identified and treated, the disease will disappear," she says. "That's what motivates me every day."
