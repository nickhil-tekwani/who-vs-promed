Delaware West Nile virus-positive Mosquito Sample; Negative on Retest
---------------------------------------------------------------------
DOVER: The mosquito sample that was reported West Nile Virus-positive by
Delaware's Division of Public Health (DPH) Laboratory on 26 Jun 2001, does
not contain the virus after all, according to additional tests carried out
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
The mosquito sample, taken on 11 Jun 2001 from a marsh pool in Little
Creek, west of Dover, was sent to the CDC to confirm [the preliminary test
results. Tissue cultures and DNA-amplification tests determined that the
sample was negative for West Nile virus. According to CDC officials, false
positive results are common due to the difficulty of detecting the virus.
Jane Getchell, Director of the DPH Laboratory, said technicians had
conducted 2 tests on the sample to identify the presence of West Nile
virus. "Testing procedures for West Nile Virus are still under development.
We are continuing to work with the CDC to refine protocols."
