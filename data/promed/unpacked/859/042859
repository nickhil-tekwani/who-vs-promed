[1] Cholera - Haiti

The Haitian capital saw a small increase in the number of people infected by cholera after last week's destructive rains from Hurricane Sandy [22 Oct 2012], an international medical group said Friday [2 Nov 2012]. Doctors Without Borders said the group's 5 cholera treatment centers had at least 457 patients Mon 29 Oct 2012. There were 500 patients on Tue 30 Oct 2012. Spokesman Mathieu Fortoul said the number of cholera patients had since dropped, with the group's clinics having about 430 patients Friday [2 Nov 2012].

The increase in cases was anticipated. Cholera spreads through water, and Haiti has seen a spike in the number of cases following periods of heavy rainfall. The country is vulnerable in large part because it doesn't have proper sanitation and sewage systems.

Cholera, an intestinal infection caused by the bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_, has sickened more than 600 000 people and killed more than 7500 others in Haiti since it surfaced several months after the devastating 2010 earthquake, health officials say. Many people have attributed the disease's introduction to a unit of UN peacekeepers from Nepal, where the disease is endemic.

Haiti was spared a direct hit from Hurricane Sandy when it passed to the west the night of 24 Oct 2012, but heavy rain in the storm's outer bands pounded the south and capital for several days. Officials say at least 54 people died, more than in any other Caribbean country. The storm also destroyed 70 percent of the crops in southern Haiti and caused widespread deaths of livestock, authorities say.

An outbreak of cholera hit the Espaillat Province in northern Dominican Republic on Sunday [4 Nov 2012], with 35 cases confirmed among more than 100 people treated with symptoms of the disease in public and private hospitals. Health Minister Freddy Lugo gave orders to reinforce services in Santiago de los Caballeros, said the director of the affected area, Dr Domingo Perez.

Official reports say the worst situation is registered in Las Amapolas, La Bandada, Guauci Abajo, Paso de Moca, La Ermita, Cuero Duro, and other communities in San Victor municipal district and Moca municipality.

On Saturday [3 Nov 2012], 32 people were in critical condition in Toribio Besconse hospital, reported its director Pedro Arroyo.

From the 1st case detected in November 2010, arriving in the country through the border with Haiti, cholera has affected 26 253 people, and according to official figures, there have been 408 deaths.
