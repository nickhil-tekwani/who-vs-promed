Concerns are mounting over a powerful new form of gonorrhea after a patient was found to [be infected by a strain of _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ with] the highest level of drug resistance to the disease ever reported in Australia. It is understood the patient, a tourist from central Europe, contracted the "sex superbug" in Sydney [Australia] and was eventually treated in Cairns [Australia].

The discovery of the case in Australia, which resulted in a health alert in July [2014], has also prompted warnings in New Zealand, where sexual health clinics are on high alert amid fears the new strain will spread there. NZ [New Zealand] Sexual Health Society president Edward Coughlan warned that the patient involved, who is believed to have left the country, had the highest level of gonorrhea drug resistance ever reported in Australia.

Some men with gonorrhea may have no symptoms at all. However, men who do have symptoms, may have: A burning sensation when urinating; A white, yellow, or green discharge from the penis; and Painful or swollen testicles. Symptoms in women can include: Painful or burning sensation when urinating; Increased vaginal discharge; and Vaginal bleeding between periods. Rectal infections may either cause no symptoms or cause symptoms in both men and women that may include: Discharge; Anal itching; Soreness; Bleeding; and Painful bowel movements.

The warning comes amid concern in recent years about an untreatable strain, known as H041, which was 1st discovered in 2009 after a sex worker fell victim to the superbug in Japan. There have also been reports of a medication-resilient strain of the sexually transmitted disease in Hawaii in May 2011, as well as in California and Norway.

Dr Coughlan warned that most antibiotics developed in the past 70 years had been useless in treating the infection, and there were no new treatment options on the horizon. "This is a major public health concern," he said.

Gonorrhea, colloquially known as the clap, is caused by _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_, a bacterium that can grow and multiply in the warm, moist areas of the reproductive tract, including the cervix, uterus and fallopian tubes in women and in the urethra in women and men. Symptoms are often silent, but the long-term effects can be devastating, causing painful pelvic disease in women and infertility in both sexes.

[_Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ has developed resistance successively to sulfonamides, penicillin, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin) and the extended-spectrum oral cephalosporin cefixime after each was introduced for treatment of gonorrhea.

Because of widespread resistance, the US CDC recommended that ciprofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones no longer be used for treatment of gonorrhea in 2007. In 2012, as a result of declining susceptibility to cefixime, the US CDC updated its recommendations for first-line treatment of uncomplicated urogenital, anorectal, and pharyngeal gonococcal disease to be only a combination of a single intramuscular dose of ceftriaxone 250 mg plus either a single dose of azithromycin 1 g orally or doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6131a3.htm).

The CDC considers that the 250 mg dose of ceftriaxone is sufficient to treat gonococcal infection at all anatomic sites caused by strains currently circulating in the United States (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6131a3.htm). The updated European gonorrhea guideline, however, recommends a 500 mg intramuscular dose of ceftriaxone plus azithromycin 2 g oral dose for uncomplicated gonorrhea (http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0956462412472837).

In the US, the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) resistance breakpoint MIC of ceftriaxone is equal to or greater than 0.5 micrograms per ml (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6131a3.htm). Whereas the European resistance breakpoint MIC is equal to or greater than 0.25 micrograms per ml (http://www.eucast.org/fileadmin/src/media/PDFs/EUCAST_files/Breakpoint_tables/Breakpoint_table_v_4.0.pdf).

In 2009, novel ceftriaxone-resistant _N. gonorrhoeae_, named H041, was isolated from the pharynx of a 31-year-old female commercial sex worker in Japan; the MIC of ceftriaxone for this isolate was high (2 micrograms per ml) (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/17/1/pdfs/10-0397.pdf). The strain was also highly resistant to penicillin G (4 micrograms per ml), cefixime (8 micrograms per ml), and levofloxacin (32 micrograms per ml). However, it demonstrated susceptibility to spectinomycin (16 micrograms per ml) and reduced susceptibility to azithromycin (0.5 micrograms per ml). The ceftriaxone-resistant strain disappeared from the pharynx of this patient after 2 courses of ceftriaxone 2 g IV, which the Japanese investigators speculated could have been spontaneous and not the effect of antibiotic therapy (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/17/1/pdfs/10-0397.pdf).

Ceftriaxone-resistant isolates were also identified in 2010 in France and in 2011 in Spain (http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/67/8/1858.full). The genotypes of the French and Spanish isolates were identical, a well-known European clone with diminished susceptibility to extended-spectrum cephalosporins, but the European genotype was different from that of the Japanese isolate.

In the US, from 2006 to 2011, the proportion of _N. gonorrhoeae_ with an elevated ceftriaxone MIC (MIC 0.125 or higher micrograms per ml) increased from 0.05 percent to 0.5 percent (http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/ceph-r-responseplanjuly30-2012.pdf). The increase was most notable in the western US and among men who have sex with men (MSM). In the West, the proportion of isolates with an elevated ceftriaxone MIC increased from 0.04 percent to 1.9 percent. Among MSM, the proportion with an elevated ceftriaxone MIC increased from 0 percent to 1.0 percent. However, from 2008 to 2012, the CDC reported that no isolate in the US had an MIC of 0.25 micrograms per ml or greater (http://www.cdc.gov/std/gisp2012/table2.htm). - Mod.ML
