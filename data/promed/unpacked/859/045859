Excerpt from article in which Alexander Yevreinov interviews Anatoly
Lipnitsky, D.Sc. (Medicine), deputy director of the Volgograd Plague
Research Center:
"Q. Wasn't the recent outbreak of Congo-Crimean fever in the Rostov region
the result of declining sanitary and epidemiological supervision in this
country as well?
A. Specialists from our research center took part in diagnosing the disease
in the Rostov village of Oblivskaya. I must say that a lot of things are
still unclear. The fact is that the diagnostic studies conducted by us and,
to the best of my knowledge, by other medical institutions, are based on the
use of test systems registering the presence of antibodies to particular
pathogenic organisms.
When we received samples of blood serum taken from acute cases in
Oblivskaya, we detected antibodies to the Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever
virus, which was used as a basis for our diagnosis. Yet specialists
categorize such diagnoses as merely oblique. The most accurate diagnosis is
the one that detects and identifies the virus itself -- whether in the
patient's blood, in a dead body, in ticks, etc. This has not as yet been
done -- I don't know why. As far as I know, the material for analysis is now
at the Ivanovsky Institute of Virology in Moscow.
Today many infection specialists are questioning the diagnosis that has been
made. First, the virus has not been identified. Second, in terms of the
classic description of Congo-Crimean fever, the course of the disease is
atypical. And, finally, the transmission mechanism is not entirely clear. In
any case, the outbreak of viral infection in Oblivskaya should become a
subject of thorough and meticulous study by specialists."

[Dr Lipnitsky is referring to the fact that serum antibodies only provide
proof of past infection, not necessarily that the current disease produced
those antibodies. Perhaps one of our subscribers in the Russian Federation
can clarify the situation for us - Mod.JW
