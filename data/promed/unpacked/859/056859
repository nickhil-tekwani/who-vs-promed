7 cases of tularemia have recently been reported in residents of 4 counties
in western Washington. In most years, 2-4 cases of tularemia are reported
statewide (annually). Investigations show that the recent cases are not
linked (to one location or source) and have been contracted naturally.
Onset dates for the patients are between 28 May and 2 Aug 2005. The age
range is 6 to 66 years old; 5 are male. Most of the exposures occurred in
the county of residence, though in 2 cases, there is a possibility of
exposure both locally and out of state, and the King county case was
contracted in north western WA.
4 of the cases presented with ulceroglandular tularemia, one with
meningitis and pneumonia, and 2 with pneumonic tularemia. 2 of the
pneumonic tularemia cases were most likely exposed while using power tools
to do landscaping (mowing, weed trimming); the ulceroglandular cases
involved insect bites; one of the exposures is still unknown.
Health advice has been sent to health care providers and veterinarians in
western Washington.
