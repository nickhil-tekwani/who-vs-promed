France Monday reported a new case of BSE, this one involving the first-ever
detection in France of the fatal disease in an imported cow [from a
neighbouring country. The first cases they reported were in livestock
imported from the UK - MHJ.
The farm ministry said in a statement the animal was born in February 1994
in Switzerland. It and the rest of its 111-strong herd in the Haute-Savoie
region were destroyed Sunday.
The last known case of BSE in France was reported in June. At that time, the
ministry said it was the 11th case found in 1999 and the 60th discovered in
France since health authorities began tracking the disease in 1990.
The ministry has previously said the number of fresh cases should decrease
after 2001 as the disease's incubation period is 5 years and all cases could
be traced back to events that occurred before late 1996, when tougher
controls were slapped on animal feed.

[Considering the proximity of the two countries, the length of their common
border, and the number of years that the disease has been known in
Switzerland, it is passing strange that it should have taken so long for a
Swiss-born animal in France to be diagnosed with BSE. Similarly, in the past
Italian-born animals have been diagnosed with BSE in the UK but not in
France. Maybe the French use different diagnostic criteria from the rest of
us. - MHJ
