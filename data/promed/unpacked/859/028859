[Rabies is regarded as one of the most important zoonotic diseases in the world (a disease which primarily affects animals, but can cause disease in humans)http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Media_Center/docs/pdf/Disease_cards/RABIES-EN.pdf.

Rabies virus belongs to the genus _Lyssavirus_, a group of viruses responsible for causing encephalitis. There are several strains of the classic rabies virus that are each generally confined to a major species as reservoir: most commonly domestic dogs, more rarely cats, and, depending on the continent, various other species of carnivores (foxes, jackals, etc) or chiroptera (bats)http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Media_Center/docs/pdf/QA_Rage_2013_EN_Final.pdf.

Rabies is present on all continents except Antarctica. Some countries have implemented vigilant control measures and succeeded in eradicating the disease. However, in some countries, the disease remains endemic with rabies present mainly in wild animal hosts.

In countries where the disease is endemic, measures are implemented to address and reduce the risk of infection in susceptible populations (wildlife, stray and domestic animals) and create a buffer between the animal source of the disease and humans.
- surveillance and reporting of suspected cases of rabies in animals
- vaccination programs for domestic animals
- research into disease dynamics, vaccines, and effective delivery mechanisms for target populations
- wildlife rabies control programs including vaccination (trap/vaccinate/release or delivery of oral vaccines)
- population control and vaccination programs for stray animal populations

In Europe, rabies has been reported mainly in wildlife animal species and sometimes in farm and pet animals in some Baltic and eastern and southern European member states http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/3129.htm?wtrl=01.

In 2011 a European Commission working group summarized the rabies situation in Bulgaria -- "Report on the task force meeting of the rabies subgroup" Plovdiv, Bulgaria 15-16 Mar 2011. According this report through 2007, an average of 15 rabies cases was detected per year. After that, rabies spread throughout the entire country from north to south. Most of the cases are reported in spring, and most occurred in wildlife (fox) and livestock. The complete document can be found at http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/eradication/rb_rep1415032011_en.pdf.

The last 6-monthly report sent by Bulgaria to the OIE (January-June 2013) indicates that rabies was reported as "absent", with the last occurrence in domestic animals reported on 21 Sep 2010 and in wild animals in July 2012 http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statuslist.

Based on quantitative information shown in the WAHID database section "Detailed countries disease incidence" at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statusdetail, during 2012 the countries with the greatest number of cases of rabies were: Belarus (474), Croatia (131), Georgia (107), Moldova (174), Poland (249), Romania (383), Russia (659), Turkey (370), and Ukraine (588). The disease was present in both domestic and wild species. - Mod.CRD
