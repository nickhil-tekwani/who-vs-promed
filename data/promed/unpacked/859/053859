Officials at Crossroads Correctional Center in Shelby confirm with NBC Montana that several inmates have experienced various forms of a skin rash that they are currently presuming out of an abundance of caution to be scabies.

They add there has not yet been a definitive clinical diagnosis.

Thus far 9 inmates have been treated for the rash.

Officials add, skin conditions such as these are a common occurrence in correctional facilities of all types and sizes, and our staff are well-prepared and trained to manage through such situations.
