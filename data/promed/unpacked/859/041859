An elderly man was infected with the West Nile virus in the wider Athens region, Greek authorities reported on Wednesday [13 Aug 2014].

Scientists of the national Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KEELPNO) have not disclosed details on the condition of the 85-year-old patient, but suggest to the public to take measures to ward off mosquitoes, which can transmit the dangerous virus.

The West Nile virus can cause encephalitis and other fatal diseases. In most cases patients have mild symptoms and there is no need of hospitalization. But about 1 per cent of people who are infected face life-threatening effects. Most of them are elderly with poor health suffering from chronic illnesses.

Outbreaks of the virus are connected with high temperatures, and Greece is experiencing a heat wave with temperatures rising up to 41 degrees Celsius this week.

The virus 1st emerged in Greece in 2010, when 262 confirmed [human] cases were recorded, among them 35 fatal. Last year [2013] there were 86 reported [human] cases and 11 deaths.

[It seems quite clear that since its appearance in Greece in 2010, West Nile virus has become endemic. It is likely that human and equine cases will continue for the remainder of this year's transmission season, and into coming years. There has already been an equine case in early July of this year (2014; see ProMED-mail archive no. 20140710.2600889, cited below). There is a commercially available vaccine for equine animals but not for humans. The measures available to prevent human cases are avoidance of mosquito bites and sustained vector control efforts in high-risk areas.

Rudolf I, Bakonyi T, Sebesta O, Mendel J, Pesko J, Betasova L, Blazejova H, Venclikova K, Strakova P, Nowotny N, Hubalek Z. West Nile virus lineage 2 isolated from _Culex modestus_ mosquitoes in the Czech Republic, 2013: expansion of the European WNV endemic area to the North?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
We report the detection and isolation of 4 almost identical strains of West Nile virus (WNV) lineage 2 from _Culex modestus_ mosquitoes collected at 3 fish ponds in South Moravia, Czech Republic, during August 2013. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the Czech WNV strains isolated are closely related to Austrian, Italian and Serbian strains reported in 2008, 2011 and 2012, respectively. Our findings show the current northernmost range of lineage 2 WNV in Europe.

Background
----------
Several human and/or equine WNF outbreaks have occurred in the last decades in Europe, for example, in Romania (1996), Italy (1998) and Russia (1999). From 2008 onwards, an unexpected explosive spread of WNV-2, which resulted in several hundreds of human neuroinvasive cases, has been documented in Hungary, Greece and Serbia.

Conclusions
-----------
The discovery of WNV-2 in the Czech Republic has added another country to the list of WNV risk areas in Europe. It also shows that 2 different lineages of WNV (lineages 2 and 3) co-circulate in the country and that the _Cx. modestus_ mosquito is a potential vector of WNV in reed belts of South Moravian fish ponds. This ornithophilic mosquito might play an important role in the bird-mosquito cycle of WNV in central Europe.

Our study highlights the need for epidemiological surveillance of (re-)emerging mosquito-borne viruses in central Europe. The seasonal peak activity of the adult _Cx. modestus_ population in central Europe is from the beginning of July to late September. Usually, the females do not enter buildings, but readily bite humans outdoors often during the day, at sun- and wind-exposed places, causing a nuisance, especially in late summer when floodwater _Aedes_ and _Ochlerotatus_ mosquito species have already vanished. The isolation of neuroinvasive WNV strains in South Moravian fish ponds (in a popular recreational and camping area during the summer) raises the question of a possible risk of a local WNV outbreak. Given the mild climate of the 2013-2014 winter, we can only speculate on the possible emergence of WNV in this year's [2014] WNV season, if favourable conditions for mass breeding of mosquitoes occur. To date, no human WNV cases have been recorded this season, which has just begun (the WNV [transmission] season in central Europe starts mid-July and the majority of cases are seen in September). While infectious disease specialists in the region are aware of the WNV situation, local general practitioners should also be aware of the circulation of WNV in this area and take it into account during differential diagnosis of late-summer neuroinfections.

[It is clear that WNV continues to move in Europe and cause neurological disease in humans and equine animals. Monitoring of WNV lineages over time in different localities provides a clearer picture of virus movement in Europe. It will be of interest to accumulate information about severity of disease caused by these WNV lineages. Issuance of alerts to medical and veterinary clinicians early in the transmission season is prudent.
