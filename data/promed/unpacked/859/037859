A single strain of the bacterium causing salmonellosis has sickened
388 people in 42 states, sending some to the hospital, over the past 3
months. There's only one problem:So far no one's been able to figure
out what's causing it.

The outbreak led the CDC to activate its emergency network this week,
pulling in staff from other areas to work on the situation, says
Frederick Angulo, deputy chief of enteric diseases. The bacteria is
called _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium. Each case has
been laboratory matched by DNA fingerprint, Angulo says.

Salmonellosis, the illness caused by infection with the salmonella
bacteria, can cause diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps from 12 to 72
hours after infection. It usually lasts 4 to 7 days. While most
people recover without treatment, in some the diarrhea is so severe
they require hospitalization. The disease can be life threatening to
the very young, the very old and those with impaired immune systems.

[The source of this growing outbreak involving 42 states and almost
400 people is not stated. As reflected in the "see also" items below,
many different vehicles for enteric pathogens are reported. The
widespread nature of the strain over several months may reflect a
vehicle that is more stable than fresh produce. ProMED awaits more
information about this outbreak and thanks Michael Owen for
contributing the posting. - Mod.LL]
