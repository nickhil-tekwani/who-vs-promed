Three clusters of measles cases occurred between June and September 2006,
in the Roma/Sinti populations in 3 different Italian regions: the
Autonomous Province of Bolzano-South Tyrol in northern Italy; Lazio in
central Italy; and the island of Sardinia in the south west.
The Roma people, often referred to as gypsies, are a heterogeneous ethnic
group who live in many countries of the world but primarily in Europe. The
Sinti are usually considered to be a subgroup of the Roma people. Although
no official data exist, it is believed that about 110 000 Roma/Sinti
currently live in Italy, and many live in caravans in either temporary or
permanent/semi-permanent settlements. A map of the regions of Italy can be
seen by reference to the original text or at
<http://worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/europe/special/italyreg.htm>.
South Tyrol cluster
-------------------
The 1st cluster of cases occurred in Bolzano-South Tyrol in northern Italy.
Seventeen cases of measles were reported in the city of Merano between 21
Jun and 11 Aug 2006; 13 of these cases occurred among the local Roma/Sinti
population It is estimated that about 700 Sinti and 200 Roma people live in
Bolzano-South Tyrol, in mainly permanent settlements. The 1st reported case
was in a 15 year old girl, who was not Roma/Sinti, who was admitted to
hospital with rash, fever, diarrhoea, and otitis. Active surveillance found
2 more cases who had been admitted to hospital 2 weeks previously, in
people from the Sinti community: a 23 year old pregnant woman with
bronchopneumonia, and her 2 year old son. Both had developed rash only
after being discharged from hospital so no isolation precautions had been
taken. Both cases were serologically confirmed. An additional 11 cases were
identified by active surveillance among the Sinti population in Merano, and
3 in the general non-Roma/Sinti population. The latter included a 29 year
old paediatrician who is thought to have acquired the infection through
healthcare-associated exposure, and a pair of 5 year old twins for whom the
source of the infection was not identified.
The median age of those infected in this outbreak was 13 years (range 2-29
years); 53 per cent of cases (9/17 cases) were below 15 years of age.
Overall, 10 of 17 cases, including 6 of the 13 Roma/Sinti cases, were
serologically confirmed, and the remaining 7 were epidemiologically linked.
Measles virus genotype D4 was isolated from 3 cases.
Lazio cluster
-------------
A 2nd cluster of 161 measles cases occurred in the Lazio region, in central
Italy, between 24 Jun and 20 Sep 2006. The cluster initially involved the
Roma/Sinti population of the cities of Rome and Latina, and then spread to
the general population, mainly to contacts (including nosocomial contacts)
of infected Roma/Sinti children.
The 1st case to be notified was a 9 year old Roma child of Romanian
nationality, who had never been vaccinated and who developed symptoms on 24
Jun 2006. The source of his infection was not determined but it is known
that the child transmitted the infection to his 3 siblings and to 2 other
children living in caravans in the same permanent settlement. Other cases
were then reported in this and other Roma/Sinti settlements across the
Lazio region, and also in the general population. As of 20 Sep 2006, 74
cases had been reported in 7 settlements and a further 87 cases had been
reported in the general population.
The epidemic curve for the outbreak, with the number of reported measles
cases by week of onset of symptoms, in nomadic (Roma/Sinti) and non-nomadic
(general) populations, is shown in Figure 2 in the original text. Two
epidemic peaks can be seen: the 1st occurred in mid-August in the nomadic
population, and the 2nd occurred in the beginning of September in the
general population.
Overall, children aged 0-4 years were the most affected age group,
representing 46 per cent (74/161 cases) of all reported cases. However,
the age distribution of measles cases differs between the Roma/Sinti and
general population. In fact, while 68 per cent (50/74) of Roma/Sinti cases
occurred in children aged 0-4 years and over 90 per cent (68/74) were aged
below 15 years, in the general population only 52 per cent of cases (44/84)
occurred in children below 15 years of age.
None of the Roma/Sinti cases had previously been vaccinated against
measles. Five of the cases (5.7 per cent) from the general population had
received only one dose of measles-containing vaccine; none seem to have had
a second dose. A total of 52 cases have been laboratory confirmed and virus
genotype D4 was isolated from 16 cases.
Sardinia cluster
----------------
The 3rd cluster of measles cases occurred in the Mediterranean island of
Sardinia and affected a Roma/Sinti nomadic camp in the town of Alghero, on
the northwest coast. Nine cases were reported from this camp, with symptom
onset dates between 12 Aug and 3 Sep 2006. All cases were in children aged
under 15 years, and 2 of the 9 cases were under 5 years old. Four of the
children had recently travelled to Rome to attend a funeral, and had stayed
from 3 to 14 Aug 2006. An epidemiological link with the Rome outbreak is
therefore possible. Laboratory confirmation of infection was obtained for 3
of 6 cases and D4 genotype was isolated from one case.
Actions taken
-------------
In response to the described clusters of measles cases, active tracing and
vaccination of susceptible contacts was performed by local health
authorities in all 3 regions and vaccination sessions were conducted
directly in campsites affected by the outbreak. A 2nd vaccination dose was
also offered to contacts who had previously received only one dose of MMR
vaccine. In addition, all local health services were informed by regional
public health authorities of the situation and were urged to investigate
all suspected cases of measles, notify measles cases immediately, alert
general practitioners, family physicians/paediatricians, and hospitals
about the outbreak and advise the latter of the importance of isolating
patients with suspected measles and of immunising hospital staff. The local
media were also informed of the outbreaks.
Discussion
----------
Various outbreaks of measles have recently occurred in other European
countries [1-7], some of which have affected Roma/Sinti populations [3,7].
Even though most Roma/Sinti do not object to immunisation, none of the
Roma/Sinti patients in the above outbreaks had been vaccinated against
measles. Such populations are continuously on the move and for this, as
well as other, mainly socioeconomic, reasons, they are more difficult to
reach in routine vaccination programmes. Epidemiological surveillance is an
essential component of the measles elimination process and, was crucial in
detecting the recent clusters in Italy. The rapid response by regional
public health agencies and local health authorities allowed good control of
measles transmission in the nomadic camps and the general population.
Highly motivated and responsive staff played a significant role in
controlling the infection.
Nevertheless, the occurrence of these outbreaks underscores the need to
achieve and maintain high vaccination coverage with 2 doses of MMR vaccine,
through routine immunisation in the general population, and to ensure that
children from hard to reach populations such as the Roma/Sinti and
immigrant communities also have access to immunisation. Factors that impede
children from hard to reach populations from being immunised must be
adequately addressed and special strategies should be developed to reach
these populations on a regular basis. In addition, it is important that all
healthcare personnel and people travelling abroad are also fully immunised.

[Measles virus in a serologically monotypic virus. Neutralising antibodies
induced by the Edmonston and other strains of vaccine virus are capable of
neutralising the infectivity of all existing epidemic viruses. Nonetheless
different lineages of vaccine and epidemic strains can be discriminated by
comparison of N and/or H gene sequences, thereby allowing tracing of
patterns of virus transmission. Currently eight clades (A to H) are defined
and within these clades 22 distinct genotypes have been differentiated.
The 3 clusters of geographically separated measles cases currently
characterised in the Roma/Sinti populations in Italy all belong to the D4
clade, as did viruses isolated from previous epidemics in the Toscana
(Tuscany) region of Italy and in Romania and parts of Germany (Hesse); (see
references below). Genotype B3 viruses have been isolated in Denmark,
Germany, Spain, and Sweden in 2006.
In contrast the viruses responsible for the measles epidemics earlier in
2006 in the Ukraine (with spill-over into Belarus) and in Germany (Bavaria)
in 2005, belonged to the D6 clade, whereas those in Romania and Germany
(Hesse and Berlin) in 2004 belonged to the D4clade. Both D4 and D6 were
isolated in Germany (North-Rhine-Westphalia) in 2004.
It is apparent that independent epidemics of measles persist in Europe
despite good vaccination coverage. - Mod.CP]
