On 13 Apr [2011], we received a report from the acting Director
Clinical Services at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital about 2
patients who had been referred to the hospital and later died there
from what the hospital thought was possible yellow fever [YF]. On
receiving the report, the surveillance teams immediately conducted
field investigations and gathered the following information about the
2 patients.

The 1st patient was a 50-year-old male from Kapluk village, Kabut Kei
Division, Baringo North District. Reported date of onset of illness
was on 18 Mar 2011 and died on 29 Mar 2011. Clinical presentation at
various stages of the illness included nose bleeding, headache,
malaise, and fever. There was no history of jaundice. Active case
search by the District Health Management Team [DHMT] in the case
household, neighbouring facilities and communities revealed that no
unusual cases of fever, jaundice, bleeding or any other unusual
illness had been detected.

Laboratory tests - ELISA and PCR tests done at KEMRI [Kenya Medical
Research Institute] were negative for yellow fever [virus] and the
other arboviruses.

The 2nd patient was a 26-year-old male from Seretunin Village, Ewalel
Division, Baringo Central District. The patient had a history of
chemical poisoning before onset of this illness. The reported date of
onset was 3 Apr 2011 and died on 5 Apr 2011. There was no history of
jaundice. A visit to the patient's home, local community and health
facilities by the DHMT did not reveal any other patient having a
similar presentation, nor unusual occurrence of fever cases.

Conclusion: As per the country surveillance guidelines, these
patients are unlikely to have died of yellow fever or the other viral
haemorrhagic fevers. As of now there is no known suspected or
confirmed yellow fever case or outbreak in Baringo County or any other
County in the country at the moment. However, the ministry has alerted
the district health authorities and communities in Baringo county to
be on high alert and to report and investigate any suspected case of
yellow fever or any other epidemic prone disease immediately as per
the surveillance guidelines.

There is adequate laboratory capacity in Kenya to confirm yellow
fever cases when they occur. Health workers are required to collect
specimens and send them to the KEMRI Arbovirus laboratory as soon as
they suspect a case of yellow fever.

The ministry will continue to strengthen the Integrated Disease
Surveillance and Response System to ensure that health authorities
respond immediately and appropriately to any case of epidemic
disease.

Baringo county is a yellow fever high risk county and routine
vaccination is done at 9 months of age through the Expanded Programme
of Immunization (EPI). Catch-up campaigns are done once every 10
years. The last campaign was done in 2002 and the next one is
scheduled for 2012.

[ProMED is grateful to Dr. Mutonga for his rapid response to the
suspected YF cases, in which he provides information that rules out YF
virus infection in these 2 cases. His report provides an excellent
example of field epidemiological surveillance and timely, effective
laboratory support. KEMRI, which provided the laboratory support, is a
WHO Collaborating Center for Arbovirus and Hemorrhagic Fever Reference
and Research.
