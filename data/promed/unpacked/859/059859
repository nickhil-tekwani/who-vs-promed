Polio in Sudan - high risk of international spread
--------------------------------------------------
The recent expansion of a prolonged outbreak of wild poliovirus type
1 (WPV1) in Sudan poses a very high risk of further international
spread, requiring urgent and immediate outbreak response activities
in the affected areas and heightened surveillance in countries at
risk. Previously restricted to southern Sudan and western Ethiopia,
the outbreak has now spread to Kenya and Uganda.

2 WPV1 cases have also been confirmed in northern Sudan (in Khartoum
and Port Sudan), reflecting either further spread of the southern
Sudan epidemic, a new importation from outside the country, or
undetected transmission of a previous importation of virus of northern
Nigeria origin into this area in 2003-6. Epidemiologic and virologic
investigations are ongoing to clarify the latter.

Of particular concern is the confirmation of the WPV1 in Port Sudan.
It is from this area that, from 2004 to 2006, WPV1 spread to
re-infect several countries, including Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Yemen,
and Indonesia, causing outbreaks that resulted in more than 1200
cases and over USD 150 million in international emergency outbreak
response costs. Due to the historical international spread of
polioviruses from Port Sudan, the new international spread from
southern Sudan to Kenya and Uganda, and the suboptimal quality of
outbreak response activities in southern Sudan and western Ethiopia
(monitoring data indicates that upwards of 30 percent of children
remain un- or under-immunized with less than or equal to 3 doses of
oral poliovirus vaccine), WHO assesses the risk of further
international spread from the Sudan as very high.

Stopping this outbreak requires the full implementation of the
international polio outbreak response standards, adopted by the World
Health Assembly in May 2006, until transmission has been confirmed to
be interrupted.

In northern Sudan, a large-scale supplementary immunization activity
(SIA) began on [15 Feb 2009] with additional campaigns planned for
[23 Mar 2009] and again in late April [2009]. In southern Sudan, SIAs
were held on [13 Jan 2009] and [23 Feb 2009], with further activities
planned for [23 Mar 2009] and late April [2009], following which the
onset of the rainy season in May could complicate the logistics of
reaching all populations in this already difficult-to-access terrain.
Consequently, particular attention is being given to closing the
persistent OPV coverage gaps during the upcoming SIAs.

In coordination with the polio campaigns in the Sudan, plans for
rapid outbreak response campaigns are being finalized for late March
[2009], late April [2009] and possibly again in late May [2009] in
the affected areas of Kenya and Uganda. Genetic sequencing data
suggests that the importations into these countries have been rapidly
detected, improving the prospects for interrupting transmission in
the near term if the campaigns are of sufficiently high quality to
reach greater than 90 percent of children in the affected areas.

It is important that countries across central Africa, the Horn of
Africa, and the Gulf strengthen surveillance for cases of acute
flaccid paralysis (AFP), in order to rapidly detect any new
poliovirus importations and facilitate a rapid response. Countries
should also analyze routine immunization coverage data to identify
any subnational gaps in population immunity to guide catch-up
immunization activities and thereby minimize the consequences of any
new virus introduction. Priority should be given to areas at
high-risk of importations and where OPV3/DPT3 coverage is less than
80 percent.

[The outbreak referred to during the period 2004-2006 was originally
associated with an importation of a case of WPV1 from Nigeria into
Darfur, Sudan in May of 2004 (see prior ProMED-mail posting
Poliomyelitis - Sudan ex Nigeria 20040622.1667). For 2 years prior to
the importation, the Sudan had been polio free (see
<http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/casecount.pdf> for
WPV isolate information by country for the period 2000 through 2009).

Following the importation, transmission continued resulting in further
importations of virus with cases into Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Yemen,
and Indonesia (see prior ProMED-mail postings listed below). Based on
this past experience, and the recent importation of cases into Kenya
and Uganda, both polio free for many years, the alert raised is
warranted. The challenge will be identifying the countries at risk --
remembering that in the last go around Indonesia was affected by the
WPV transmission in the Sudan, suggesting a much higher and broader
population mobility than previously expected.

Health authorities register 29 cases of poliomyelitis in 12 months
------------------------------------------------------------------
Angolan health authorities registered, nationwide, a total of 341
cases of poliomyelitis from February 2008 to the same month
[February] of 2009 [see moderator comment below as this is markedly
misleading - Mod.MPP], ANGOP learnt on Monday [2 Mar 2009].

The information was released during the 5th session of the Technical
Advisory Group (TAG) on eradication of poliomyelitis in Angola, RDC
[Democratic Republic of the Congo], Namibia, and Zambia, by Alda
Morais, head of the vaccination programme, whilst speaking about
Angola's epidemiologic situation.

The source added that 28 cases of polio were recorded in 2008 and one
last January [2009], in the central Benguela province, making a total
of 29 cases in 12 months.

A total of 8 national vaccination campaigns against poliomyelitis
were carried out in 2008.

The National Vaccination Programme (PAV) will this year [2009]
increase networks of fixed and control posts, upgrade trainers and
reinforce the participation of the Angolan Armed Forces, NGO,
medicine and nursing schools.

The next vaccination campaign will start in June 2009.

[According to the polio eradication website
(<http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/casecount.pdf>),
during 2008 there were a total of 29 cases with confirmed WPV
infection in Angola. Since the beginning of 2009 there was one
confirmed case of polio with a date of onset of most recent WPV1
isolated on 24 Jan 2009.

The newswire above erroneously reports 341 cases of polio in the
12-month period. It is highly likely that the figure of 341 refers to
AFP (acute flaccid paralysis) cases that were identified during the
year. AFP cases are the primary focus of surveillance activities for
identification of suspected polio cases, and specimens are collected
from AFP cases to determine if the acute flaccid paralysis was caused
by poliovirus infection. In 2007, there were 282 AFP cases identified
and investigated during the year (see
<http://www.afro.who.int/polio/surv_indicators/afp_performance_indicators2007.pdf>), of which 257 (91 percent) had adequate specimens sent for
further
identification of the etiology. Given that number, it is highly likely
that the 341 "cases" referred to in the newswire above are AFP cases
that were ruled out as being non-poliovirus in origin.

Importations into previously polio free countries from Nigeria and
now Sudan continue to occur in 2008 and 2009. The current political
strife in the Sudan does not bode well for control of WPV
circulation. - Mod.MPP]
