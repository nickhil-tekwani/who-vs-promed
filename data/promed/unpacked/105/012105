Alert: Taylor County, GA is 20th in state positive for soybean rust
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The 20th Georgia county confirmed to be infected with Asian soybean
rust [ASR] in 2005 is Taylor County in east-central Georgia. The find
brings the U.S. total to 62.
According to the Georgia state commentary this afternoon [1 Oct
2005], diagnostician Jason Brock identified ASR on a soybean sample
from Taylor County on 13 Sep 2005, the 1st find in that county. Layla
Sconyers, who posted the commentary, said "This find is not a
surprising one, as the disease is widespread across the Coastal
Plain."
On Friday [30 Sep 2005], Georgia officials reported that a commercial
soybean field in Tift County already had at least 5 separate
ASR-infected sites. The commercial field of MG VII soybeans was
planted in early June 2005 and has reached R5 growth stage. "The most
interesting aspect of the find was that, despite drought conditions
and wilted crop, the pustules were still producing numerous spores,"
said Bob Kemerait, Extension Plant Pathologist. "Obviously, the
infection efficacy of each spore is reduced under dry conditions, but
many spores are still present in Georgia."
Kemerait said on 29 Sep 2005 that very dry and warm conditions across
the Georgia Coastal Plain apparently slowed ASR; no new finds have
been made since last week. Though ASR is certainly in many commercial
fields not yet identified, it seems that most soybean growers in the
state will escape significant losses, as harvest is rapidly
approaching.
Alabama
-------
>From the Alabama state commentary 30 Sep 2005: Relatively dry
conditions over the last 3 weeks have made for unfavorable growing
conditions for soybean rust and slowed disease development. Fields
beyond the R5 growth stage should not be treated with a fungicide.
Scouting [checking] for ASR can still be accomplished this late in the season
by looking at soybean plants that are still green along the edge of
dried-down fields.
"We will also be scouting volunteer [self-sown] soybeans for rust development
in the coming months," said Ed Sikora of Auburn University.

[National Map Commentary (updated: 1 Oct 2005): The latest county to be
reported positive for Asian soybean rust (ASR) is Taylor county in Georgia.
Oconee county in Georgia is the furthest northern location where ASR has been
found in 2005.
Calhoun county in South Carolina is the furthest east that ASR has been found,
while Pearl River county in Mississippi is the furthest west that ASR has been
found in 2005.
Alabama now has 15 counties reported positive with ASR; Florida has
22; Georgia has 20; Mississippi has 2; and South Carolina has 3.
There were 35 counties reporting ASR in August 2005, with 11 reports
so far for September 2005. As the growing season has finished or
nearly finished in most regions, the threat of ASR has diminished. It
may be expected that ASR will continue to be found in more counties
within states already reporting ASR and in adjacent states without
causing any economic damage.
The 3rd link below describes the distribution of kudzu (_Pueraria montana_
var. _lobata_). Kudzu is an invasive plant that is being subjected to
aggressive attempts to eradicate it. Kudzu-infested states are the following:
AR, CT, DC, DE, FL, GA, IL, IN, KY, MD, MO, MS, NC, ND, NJ, OR, PA, SC, TN,
TX, VA, and WV. It is obvious that a large area of the United States is
infested with kudzu, and I suspect that many farmers are concerned about
native plants being crowded out. The 3rd and 4th links deal with a map of
kudzu-infested states and links to kudzu sites.
