Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Birds / 6661 / 6626 / 6626 / - / - / 0
Affected population: 11-month-old laying hens with digestive disorders and a drop in lay with a 50% mortality rate at the beginning. The outbreak is located in the village of Tohoue, which is close to Nigeria.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: Massive mortality up to 50% was observed the 1st 2 days following the onset of the disease in laying hens in a farm where the animals are kept in pens. The mortality to date is 6626 poultry birds.

Control measures at event level
Domestic control measures applied: quarantine

Domestic control measures to be applied: zoning; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; movement control inside the country; slaughter; official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste; disinfection; screening; control of wildlife reservoirs

Wild control measures to be applied: control of wildlife reservoirs

Abstract
---------
"In the recent past, sub-Saharan Africa has not escaped the devastating effects of avian influenza virus (AIV) in poultry and wild birds. This systematic review describes the prevalence, spatiotemporal distribution, and virus subtypes detected in domestic and wild birds for the past 2 decades (2000-2019). We collected data from 3 electronic databases, PubMed, SpringerLink electronic journals and African Journals Online, using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses protocol. A total of 1656 articles were reviewed, from which 68 were selected. An overall prevalence of 3.0% AIV in birds was observed. The prevalence varied between regions and ranged from 1.1% to 7.1%. The Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon signed-rank sum test showed no significant difference in the prevalence of AIV across regions, X2(3) = 5.237, p = 0.1553 and seasons, T = 820, z = -1.244, p = 0.2136. Nineteen hemagglutinin/neuraminidase subtype combinations were detected during the reviewed period, with southern Africa recording more diverse AIV subtypes than other regions. The most detected subtype was H5N1, followed by H9N2, H5N2, H5N8, and H6N2. Whilst these predominant subtypes were mostly detected in domestic poultry, H1N6, H3N6, H4N6, H4N8, H9N1, and H11N9 were exclusively detected in wild birds. Meanwhile, H5N1, H5N2, and H5N8 were detected in both wild and domestic birds, suggesting circulation of these subtypes among wild and domestic birds. Our findings provide critical information on the eco-epidemiology of AIVs that can be used to improve surveillance strategies for the prevention and control of avian influenza in sub-Saharan Africa."

Conclusions
"Our review of AIVs in sub-Saharan Africa has provided an insight into the ecology and epidemiological trends of AIVs in birds over a 20-year period (2000-2019). We found a considerable diversity of AIV subtypes in sub-Saharan Africa, with some subtypes being detected frequently in both wild and domestic birds. Furthermore, AIV was detected in wildfowl and domestic birds in both the wet and dry seasons, with viruses being detected in both Eurasian migratory and indigenous African wild birds. These results suggest a year-round perpetuation of AIVs in Afrotropical ecosystems, with seasonal variation. Continued surveillance, especially in wild birds, to better understand the eco-epidemiology of IAVs, along with improved biosecurity on poultry farms, enhanced extension services and engagement of various disciplines under a 'One Health' approach in tackling avian influenza could assist in mitigating the impact of AIV in sub-Saharan Africa." - Mod.CRD
