As of [Sat 2 Sep 2017], there have been a total of:
1712 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including
690 deaths [reported case fatality rate 40.3 percent],
1001 recoveries, and
21 currently active cases/infections.

[As previously mentioned, the numbers of deaths, recoveries, and currently active cases come from my spreadsheet tallies and differ from those listed on the Saudi MOH website; my spreadsheet counts asymptomatic infections. One complication is the reporting of cases as either recoveries or deaths that cannot be confirmed as previously reported newly confirmed cases. - Mod.MPP]

Since the last ProMED-mail update [Tue 29 Aug 2017], there have been a total of:
4 newly confirmed cases
2 newly reported fatalities, and
4 newly reported recoveries.

[In the past 4 days since the last update [Tue 29 Aug 2017] there have been 4 newly confirmed cases - 3 of whom were asymptomatic secondary household contacts of a previously confirmed case in Dawmat Aljandal (Al Jawf region), and the 4th, a primary case in Hail (Hail region) with a history of indirect contact with camels. Since [Sun 26 Aug 2017] there have been 6 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection in household contacts of a previously confirmed case in Dawmat Aljandal (Al Jawf region), perhaps related to the "primary" case reported on [Thu 24 Aug 2017], presumably not related to the earlier healthcare associated outbreak in the same town earlier in August, but specific details on these cases have not been available.

In the month of August 2017, there were a total of 33 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, 8 fatalities and 11 recoveries reported by the Saudi MOH. 20 of the 33 newly confirmed cases were from Dawmat Aljandal (Al Jawf region), of whom 13 were asymptomatic contacts (6 of whom were household contacts and 7 were healthcare acquired infections).

The 13 additional cases reported outside of Dawmat Aljandal involved individuals from Makkah region (Jeddah, 4 cases, one of whom was a household contact), Riyadh region (Aldelem one case, Alaflaj one case), Hail region (Hail 2 cases), Al Madinah region (Al Ula one case, Madinah one case), Najran region (Najran one case), `Asīr region (Khamis Mushayet one case) and Al Bāhah region (Beljershi Albaha one case).
