Russia: 200 children hospitalised after eating Chinese fruits
-------------------------------------------------------------
Over 200 children, most of them younger than 3 years, were
hospitalised with acute intestinal infection after eating fruits
imported from China, the Rossiya TV channel reported on Sunday [31 Jan
2010].

According to doctors, the children were poisoned after eating imported
fruits -- bananas, apples, and citrus fruits -- mostly supplied from
China.

Health authorities are taking measures to contain the spread of the
[infection] which has affected the entire Magadanskaya Oblast in the
country's Far East, with children hit hardest, the TV channel said.

The infection is predicted to subside in spring [2010] when navigation
will allow domestic food supplies into the subarctic region, the
report said.

[According to a Russian language report in TSN.ua of 31 Jan 2010
(<http://ru.tsn.ua/svit/v-rossii-bolshe-200-detei-zarazilis-grippom-iz-za-kitaiskih-fruktov.html>), the majority of the patients were 3 years-of age or younger, and the source of the infection was rotavirus contamination of the skins of fruit -- apples, bananas, and citrus fruits -- imported from
China.

Rotavirus is the most common cause of severe diarrhea among children,
resulting in the death of over 600 000 children annually worldwide.
The incubation period for rotavirus disease is approximately 2 days.
The disease is characterized by vomiting and watery diarrhea for 3-8
days, and fever and abdominal pain occur frequently. Immunity after
infection is incomplete, but repeat infections tend to be less severe
than the original infection. The primary mode of transmission is
fecal-oral, although some have reported low titers of virus in
respiratory tract secretions and other body fluids. Because the virus
is stable in the environment, transmission can occur through ingestion
of contaminated water or food and contact with contaminated surfaces.
Consequently citrus and other fruits should be thoroughly washed and
then peeled before feeding to young children. In countries with a
temperate climate, the disease has a winter seasonal pattern, with
annual epidemics occurring from November to April. The highest rates
of illness occur among infants and young children, but adults can also
be infected, though disease tends to be mild. A rotavirus vaccine has
recently become available which is effective in preventing rotavirus
gastroenteritis.
