CDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigated a multistate outbreak of _Listeria monocytogenes_ infections. CDC investigated this outbreak in 2019 and 2020 but was unable to gather enough data to identify the source in the past. It reopened the investigation in November 2021 when 4 new illnesses were reported since the end of August 2021.

During the most recent investigation, epidemiologic, laboratory, and traceback data showed that packaged salads produced by Dole made people sick.

As of [4 Apr 2022], this outbreak is over.

Epidemiologic data
------------------
A total of 18 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Listeria monocytogenes_ were reported from 13 states (see map [available at the source URL above]). The true number of sick people in an outbreak is likely higher than the number reported, and the outbreak may not have been limited to the states with known illnesses. This is because some people recover without medical care and are not tested for listeria.

Illnesses started on dates ranging from [16 Aug 2014 to 15 Jan 2022] (see timeline [available at the source URL above]). Sick people ranged in age from 50 to 94 years (median 76), and 83% were female. Of 16 people with information available, all were hospitalized. 3 deaths were reported, one each from Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin.

State and local public health officials interviewed people (or their families) about the foods they ate in the month before they got sick. Of the 10 people interviewed, 9 (90%) reported eating packaged salads. Of the 3 people who remembered a specific brand, two reported Dole and one reported Little Salad Bar.

Laboratory and traceback date
-----------------------------
Public health investigators used the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that were part of this outbreak. CDC PulseNet manages a national database of DNA fingerprints of bacteria that cause foodborne illnesses. DNA fingerprinting is performed on bacteria using a method called whole genome sequencing (WGS). WGS showed that bacteria from sick people's samples were closely related genetically. This suggests that people in this outbreak got sick from the same food.

In October 2021, before the most recent CDC investigation began, the Georgia Department of Agriculture identified listeria in a Dole brand garden salad as part of a routine sampling program of food at grocery stores. WGS later showed that the listeria in the garden salad was the outbreak strain. The garden salad was produced at Dole's Bessemer City, North Carolina, facility.

After CDC reopened this outbreak investigation, the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development collected samples of packaged salads from retail stores for testing and identified the outbreak strain of listeria in a Marketside brand package of shredded iceberg lettuce. The shredded iceberg lettuce was produced at Dole's Yuma, Arizona, facility.

Dole conducted a root cause analysis and collected samples from their facilities and equipment for testing. Dole found listeria on equipment used to harvest iceberg lettuce. FDA conducted WGS and found that the listeria on the equipment was the outbreak strain.

Dole's continued investigation found the outbreak strain on a piece of equipment in their Yuma facility and in packaged salads on hold that were included in the initial recall.

Public health actions
---------------------
On [22 Dec 2021], Dole recalled all Dole-branded and private label packaged salads processed at their Bessemer City, North Carolina, and Yuma, Arizona, facilities.

On [7 Jan 2022], Dole recalled additional products containing iceberg lettuce harvested by the contaminated harvesting equipment.

[The US CDC has been investigating 2 separate listeria multistate outbreaks involving packaged salads. One outbreak concerns Fresh Express-packed salads and the other outbreak, Dole-packed salads. ProMED has posted reports on both of these outbreaks; see ProMED posts: Listeriosis - USA (07): fatal, packaged salad mix, recall, alert 20211223.8700448; Listeriosis - USA (08): fatal, 2 outbreaks, packaged salad, recall, alert 20211225.8700469; and Listeriosis - USA: fatal, packaged salad, contaminated lettuce harvester, recall 20220204.8701257.

Please see ProMED post (Listeriosis - USA (07): fatal, packaged salad mix, recall, alert 20211223.8700448) for my moderator comments on listeria outbreaks.

The CDC report above indicates that the multistate listeriosis outbreak linked to packaged salads containing listeria-contaminated produced by Dole is over. The Dole outbreak involved 18 cases, including 3 deaths, between 2014 and 30 Dec 2021 in 13 US states. Salads containing the tainted lettuce from multiple Dole processing facilities were shipped throughout the US and to several provinces in Canada. The source for this outbreak was traced to equipment used in the harvesting of the raw iceberg lettuce that was contaminated with the outbreak strain of _L. monocytogenes_. The identification of the outbreak strain was based on whole genome sequencing. - Mod.ML
