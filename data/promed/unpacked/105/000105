A 74-year-old man from the St Louis area died this week of the
tick-borne disease ehrlichiosis, state health officials announced
today [6 Jun 2009]. The case was one of 9 reported cases of diseases
transmitted by ticks in the state this season.

Ehrlichiosis is similar to Rocky Mountain spotted fever and causes
flu-like symptoms that can in rare cases lead to kidney failure and
breathing complications.

The man had discovered a tick on his body after a fishing trip in
northeast Missouri. He had underlying health problems that may have
been a factor in his death, according to health officials.

Last season [2008] brought a record number of tick-borne diseases
(668) to the state. Health officials again are urging people to wear
insect repellent and check their skin for ticks after being outdoors.
