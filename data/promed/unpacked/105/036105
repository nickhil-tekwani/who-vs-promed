Outbreak of suspected catarrhal fever in France
-------------------------------------
A farm in Cantal is suspected to have a case of catarrhal fever in its
sheep, according to the French agriculture ministry. The disease is
transmitted by mosquito bites but is not transmissible to humans. More
commonly known as bluetongue disease, it is found in ruminants exclusively,
but is fatal only for sheep.
Samples have been taken and are being tested by France's food safety
agency. A 20 km security cordon has been set up around the farm. European
legislation states that if a case [of bluetongue is found, then no
intra-community animal trading can take place in certain restricted areas.

[Bluetongue is a noncontagious viral disease that affects ruminants and
that has been reported on all continents except Antarctica. There are 24
serotypes worldwide. The bluetongue virus has an affinity for the red blood
cell and survive in infected cattle until infected cells are catabolized.
Thus, cattle serve as reservoirs for the virus. The virus can co-exist with
high neutralizing antibody titers.
The usual incubation period in sheep is 5-10 days. Clinical signs include
shortness of breath, with panting; hyperemia of the lips, muzzle, and ears;
pyrexia; depression and inflammation, erosions, and ulceration of the oral
mucous membranes, particularly the dental pad. Other signs include swollen
cyanotic tongue, lameness due to coronitis and widespread muscle necrosis,
torticollis, vomiting, pneumonia, conjunctivitis, and alopecia.
The diagnosis is confirmed by several laboratory identification methods.
Vaccines are used widely in southern Africa, but controlling the vector is
also an important method of controlling the disease. ­ Mod.TG
