While Alberta's fall [2009] surveillance program for chronic wasting
disease (CWD) in wild deer has turned up fewer cases than last year's
[2008], deer with the disease were found further south and west than
previously detected.

Hunters have submitted more than 4800 wild deer heads for testing
since 1 Sep 2009, the province said in a release Friday [19 Mar
2010]. Of the 12 new cases of CWD identified, 10 were detected near
past positive cases.

One new case, however, was detected south of Highway 1, 25 kilometres
[15.5 mi] south of Medicine Hat. Another case was found just east of
Highway 884 along the Red Deer River.

The 12 new cases, along with an "emaciated" deer found in June
[2009], bring the total to 13 new cases of CWD found in 2009, down
from 25 in 2008. Since the 1st case of CWD was found in the province
in 2005, there have been 74 cases in Alberta's wild deer.

11 of the 12 new positive cases from the fall [2009] program were
mule deer and 9 of the hunter-killed cases were adult males,
including an adult male white-tailed deer, the province said.

Current strategies for monitoring the spread of CWD include
"maximizing the harvest" of deer in risk areas and continuing the
testing program. The province has run ongoing surveillance in elk and
wild deer since 1996.

The province's surveillance program includes testing roadkill and any
wild deer that may show CWD symptoms, such as loss of co-ordination,
weight loss, excessive salivating, and isolation from other deer.

The province's sustainable resource development ministry said it
"continues to talk with stakeholders and landowners in the area to
discuss plans for management."

According to Saskatchewan's environment ministry, CWD was
unintentionally introduced into farmed elk population taken from
South Dakota and has since been introduced to Saskatchewan, Alberta,
and Korea. The economics of trade in live elk and their products,
such as antler velvet, has been affected as a result.

Because CWD belongs to the group of transmissible spongiform
encephalopathy (TSE) diseases along with BSE in cattle, scrapie in
sheep, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, the association has
led to possible public health concerns -- although there remains no
scientific evidence that CWD can infect humans.

The disease can be transmitted from one animal to another, mainly
through contaminated saliva or contaminated feed and water.
Infectious material can survive in the environment for an unknown
period -- at least 3 years, the Saskatchewan government said.

[CWD has also been found in 3 isolated geographic areas of
Saskatchewan's northeast, northwest, and southwest.

While most deer do not roam much more than a mile diameter from their
"home" territory, there are other ways of translocating the disease,
including predators dragging carcasses, hunters unwittingly
transporting carcasses, or relocation of deer from one area to
another. - Mod.TG]
