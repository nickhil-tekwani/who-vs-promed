Horse owners are being urged to remain vigilant after an unvaccinated horse infected with the Hendra virus was euthanised in northern NSW.

The infected 11-year-old gelding, from a property near Lismore, is the 1st confirmed case of the virus in NSW this year [2017], Department of Primary Industries chief veterinary officer Dr Christine Middlemiss said in a statement on Sunday [9 Jul 2017]. The horse wasn't eating and was wobbly on its feet on Friday - a day after it was noticed to be lethargic, she said.

Flying foxes, or fruit bats, are the natural reservoir of Hendra virus, which can affect humans, horses and dogs.

"Vaccination remains the most effective way of reducing the risk of Hendra virus infection in horses, but good biosecurity and personal hygiene measures should always be practised in conjunction with it," she said.

Horses should be kept away from trees that are attractive to bats, and feed and water containers should be covered so they can't be contaminated.

All known Hendra virus cases have occurred in Queensland or northern NSW.

The property near Lismore has been placed under movement restrictions by Local Land Services.

[That an infected horse puts its human caretakers at risk of death from this horrible virus should be enough to make people vaccinate. It should be a matter of self-preservation.

Vaccination of the horse protects the horse, humans, and dogs. The price of vaccination is small (no matter the cost) to protect everyone. Just think how devastating it would be if your spouse, child, or a neighbor's child caught this disease and died, just for lack of vaccination. Insurance only has to pay for itself once for you to be glad you had it. - Mod.TG
