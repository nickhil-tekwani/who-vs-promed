Influenza Update Number 126
---------------------------
Summary
-------
Influenza transmission in North America appears to be levelling off or
decreasing according to several national influenza indicators, though
not all regions have experienced a peak yet. Influenza activity in
North America has been related primarily to influenza A (H3N2) virus
with some co-circulation of influenza type B in the United States
(U.S.). Influenza transmission in the United Kingdom (U.K.),
predominantly related to influenza A (H1N1) 2009, is now decreasing.
Influenza activity on the European continent is increasing,
particularly in the west, and countries are increasingly reporting
severe and fatal cases.

Severe cases have been reported in association with all three
influenza viruses, H1N1 (2009), influenza A (H3N2), and influenza type
B, but H1N1 (2009) appears to be disproportionately over-represented
among severe cases when compared to the distribution of viruses in the
community. The large majority of the viruses characterized from North
America and Europe continue to be of the same lineages as those found
in the current seasonal trivalent vaccine. Transmission in Northern
Africa and Northern Asia has peaked recently and is declining. In the
tropics, several countries of southern Asia have seen increasing
trends recently mainly due to H1N1 (2009). Other tropical areas of the
world and the temperate countries of the Southern Hemisphere are
currently reporting very little influenza circulation.

Countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
Several national-level indicators of influenza transmission indicate
that influenza may be levelling off or decreasing in North America;
however, there are many areas that have not yet experienced widespread
circulation and some that are now reporting increases in activity.
Rates of influenza-like illness (ILI) and hospital admissions due to
influenza have decreased nationally in the last 2 weeks in Canada,
though one region of Ontario has reported an increased rate. The
national rate of ILI reporting is similar to influenza seasons prior
to 2009. About 23 percent of specimens tested in Canada are positive
for influenza, which is slightly decreased from recent weeks.
Influenza type A accounts for 98 percent of influenza viruses
detected. Of the influenza type A viruses characterized, 91 percent
are H3N2 and the 16 percent, H1N1 (2009); the H1N1 (2009) proportion
is increased from 6 percent in week 52.

In the United States (U.S.), several influenza activity indicators
have also decreased nationally, though the proportion of outpatient
visits due to ILI remains slightly above the epidemic threshold. Rates
of death reported due to pneumonia and influenza from a sentinel
surveillance system that includes data from 122 cities across the
country are below the epidemic threshold. About 26 percent of clinical
specimens tested in week 2 of 2011 were positive for influenza, a
slight increase from the 20 percent reported previously. The
proportion of the detections accounted for by influenza type B
decreased to 15 percent of the samples tested, from 26 percent of
influenza isolates in previous weeks. Of the influenza type A viruses
that have been sub-typed, 74 percent are H3N2 and the other 26
percent are H1N1 (2009) which is an increase in the proportion of H1N1
(2009) in comparison to earlier weeks.

As in previous weeks, all of the influenza A and 92 percent of the
influenza type B viruses characterized antigenically are of the same
lineages as contained in the current trivalent seasonal influenza
vaccine. In Mexico the percentage of samples positive for influenza
was 30 percent with around 60 percent influenza type B and 30 percent
H3N2. Based on the proportion of samples testing positive, influenza
activity in Mexico appears to be decreasing.

Influenza transmission continues to increase in Europe, particularly
in the West. In the United Kingdom, where intensive care units have
been stressed by the numbers of severe influenza cases, activity has
peaked and the number of severe cases is now declining. Many countries
of Western Continental Europe are now reporting significant numbers of
severe and fatal cases of influenza though intensive care units (ICU)
have not yet been stressed to the degree seen in the UK. In Denmark,
the proportion of patients in ICU due to influenza infection rose from
4 percent 2 weeks ago to 9.5 percent in the past week. In France, 290
influenza cases have required intensive care management. Notably, 41
percent of ICU cases in France were found to not have pre-existing
underlying risk conditions, a higher proportion than seen in the UK,
and 58 percent are between the ages of 15 and 64 years. Similar to
observations in the U.K., only 8 percent of severe cases in France had
been vaccinated against influenza.

Of the samples tested from sentinel sites across Europe 43 percent
were positive for influenza, unchanged for the last 2 weeks. The
dominant strain in Europe is currently H1N1 (2009), with a few
countries reporting co-circulation of influenza type B. Norway is a
notable exception with predominance of influenza type B. Of influenza
viruses that have been subtyped, 72 percent were type A and 28 percent
type B. Of the type A viruses subtyped, 95 percent were H1N1 (2009)
and 5 percent influenza A (H3N2). H1N1 (2009) appears to be
over-represented in severe cases compared to frequency with which it
is detected in the community. For example, in France of the ICU cases
for which subtype data are available, 90 percent were found to have
H1N1 (2009) or unsubtyped influenza A, 1 percent influenza A (H3N2)
and only 8 percent influenza type B.

A similar disparity between mild and severe cases was earlier noted in
the U.K. As in North America, viruses that were antigenetically
characterized in Europe were nearly all of the same lineages as those
in the current trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine, with only a small
number of influenza B viruses of the Yamagata lineages detected.

Several countries of North Africa and the Middle East are also
experiencing increases in influenza activity. Morocco, Algeria, and
Tunisia have had modestly increased levels of influenza detections in
the last 2 to 3 weeks. Influenza type B has been the predominant virus
reported with lesser amounts of H1N1 (2009). Limited data suggests
that H1N1 (2009) is circulating in Egypt where 122 H1N1 (2009) related
deaths have been reported since October 2010. Iran and Pakistan have
also had a steady increase in influenza detection in the same period
of time with the majority of viruses being H1N1 (2009).

Influenza transmission in North Africa and the Middle East appears to
have peaked overall, though data from Tunisia, Morocco and Pakistan
suggest an increasing trend. H1N1 (2009) is the predominant virus in
the area, with the exception of Algeria which has reported a
predominance influenza type B in recent weeks. However, the proportion
of influenza type B in Algeria is declining with increasing detections
of H1N1 (2009). Transmission in Egypt peaked in late December 2010 or
early January, along with the rest of the region, and the weekly
reporting of fatal cases is declining.

Influenza transmission in the temperate areas of Asia, including
Mongolia, northern China, the Republic of Korea, and Japan has
recently peaked and is now declining. There were some differences
noted in the predominant viruses detected in countries of the area.
Mongolia and northern China reported a predominance influenza A
(H3N2), which appears to have peaked around the 3rd week of December
at which time increasing numbers of H1N1 (2009) viruses began to be
detected. The Republic of Korea, in contrast, experienced peak of
transmission coinciding with the peak in northern China, but over 90
percent of influenza viruses reported there were H1N1 (2009).
Transmission in Japan began with a predominance of H3N2, with a peak
that coincided with the rest of temperate Asia, but more recently H1N1
(2009) has become the predominant virus detected there though overall
levels of detection are declining.

Countries in the tropical zone
------------------------------
The most active area of transmission in tropical regions of the world
is in Asia. In tropical areas of the Americas, reports indicate very
little transmission of influenza viruses. Previously reported active
circulation of H3N2 in Paraguay, continues to decline. The few viruses
detected in the area otherwise are a mixture of influenza type B and
(H1N1) 2009. In sub-Saharan Africa, available data indicate little
activity in most countries. Madagascar, however, still has moderate
levels of circulation of mainly H3N2 virus.

In Asia, Singapore and Hong Kong report crossing their epidemic
threshold of respiratory disease activity with the largest fraction of
samples tested being H1N1 (2009) and an increase in H1N1 (2009)
positive samples is also reported from Southern China. Data from South
East Asia indicate only small numbers of influenza virus detections
and no increases in respiratory disease activity.

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
The countries of the southern temperate regions of the world have had
very little influenza transmission since the end of their winter
season. Australia, however, continues to report out-of-season
transmission of small numbers of H3N2 and influenza type B viruses.

Virological surveillance
------------------------
During weeks 1 to 2, influenza activity in parts of the northern
hemisphere continued to increase, in particular in Europe with A(H1N1)
and B viruses predominating. In Asia influenza A(H1N1) and A(H3N2)
predominated and in the North Americas A(H3N2) and B viruses co-
circulated.

FluNet reports
--------------
During weeks 1 to 2 (02 Jan 2011 to 15 Jan 2011), National Influenza
Centres (NICs) from 74 countries, areas or territories reported data
to FluNet. A total of 21 104 specimens were reported as positive for
influenza viruses, 16 586 (78.6 percent) were typed as influenza A,
4518 (21.4 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A
viruses reported, 74.5 percent were influenza H1N1(2009) and 25.4
percent were influenza A(H3N2). The proportion of H1N1(2009) compared
to A(H3N2) reported to FluNet increased markedly compared to December.

[As of 28 Jan 2011, of the samples tested from sentinel sites across
Europe, 43 percent were positive for influenza, unchanged for the last
2 weeks. The dominant strain in Europe is currently H1N1 (2009), with
a few countries reporting co-circulation of influenza type B. In
contrast, the predominant virus in North America has been influenza
(H3N2) virus with some co-circulation of influenza type B.

Influenza H1N1 (2009) appears to be disproportionately
over-represented among severe cases when compared to the distribution
of viruses in the community. The large majority of the viruses
characterized from North America and Europe continue to be of the same
lineages as those found in the current seasonal trivalent vaccine.

Influenza transmission continues to increase across Europe. In the
United Kingdom, however, where intensive care units have been stressed
by the numbers of severe influenza cases, activity has peaked and the
number of severe cases is now declining. - Mod.CP]
