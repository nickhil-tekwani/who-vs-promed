An outbreak of leptospirosis, an infectious disease that is generally transmitted from rats to humans and capable of causing a clinical condition ranging from fever to multiple organ damage, has been detected in San Justo, the main city of the department bearing the same name in Santa Fe Province, Argentina.

Of the 6 cases that were officially confirmed by the Santa Fe Health Ministry, one person has died, and there are 3 people severely affected. These latter people presented with a "non-specific febrile illness, upon which a clinical diagnosis of leptospirosis was assumed, considering epidemiological background, clinical features, laboratory tests performed, and because of living in the vicinity of flooded areas as a consequence of the recent heavy rainfall," explained an officer of the Provincial Health Promotion and Prevention Office. The affected people are currently living in the vicinity of flooded areas, near Rio Salado, which went out of its course nearly 10 days ago, after a 350 mm rainfall.

There is a team belonging to the Health Promotion and Prevention area working alongside local teams in order to reinforce reporting suspicious cases and also looking for cases of non-specific febrile illness, taking appropriate samples, and prescribing early therapy. The team is also reviewing the local environmental conditions so appropriate measures may be taken in order to improve the quality of life of the population.

Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease affecting animals and humans. It is also known as swamp fever, since one way of acquiring this condition is related to exposure to water, mud, flooded land, and overflowing rivers. Rats are the main reservoir for the disease, because they shed _Leptospira_ bacteria, the causative agents for this disease, in their urine, contaminating the environment. Domestic animals that are more prone to developing this disease are dogs, cattle, pigs, and horses.

Vulnerable people are those who might have been exposed to floods during the last few weeks or those performing sports or working activities in streams, lagoons, wells, and particularly in stagnant water. It is also possible to acquire the disease by contact of skin or mucosa contact with mud as well as with wet materials (cleared land, garbage) contaminated with urine of [infected] rats.

Humans who become infected following exposure to water or through the consumption of contaminated foods may develop an illness that ranges from an influenza-like condition to a severe disease that may present with liver, kidney, and lung involvement. Usual symptoms include fever, headache or muscle pain, reddening of the conjunctivae, rash, nausea, and vomiting, which may occur after an incubation period lasting from 1-2 weeks, and if such manifestations should occur, the affected person must go as soon as possible to the nearest health center. Physicians, after performing a clinical examination, may request some laboratory tests in order to confirm or rule out the diagnosis. If the disease is confirmed, then antibiotic therapy is indicated. [Antibiotic therapy is often started on suspicion of the diagnosis of leptospirosis prior to laboratory confirmation because of the potentially fatal course of severe untreated leptospirosis.]

With respect to preventive measures, health authorities emphasized the importance of avoiding contact with stagnant waters, the use of adequate protective measures (boots and gloves) when working in risky areas and to properly eliminate underbrush from houses, as well as maintaining properly clean yards and wastelands. They also recommended that openings that might be used by rats to enter households must be sealed, and garbage and waste must be properly eliminated so there may be no shelters for rodents. Garbage must also be placed in adequately covered receptacles.

[The news report above says that the 6 confirmed cases of leptospirosis were living in the city of San Justo in the vicinity of flooded areas, near Rio Salado, in Santa Fe Department, Argentina. A map of this area can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/San+Justo/@-30.7894377,-60.5910225,67820m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x944ad62af207cfe3:0x85cc72a495d69ca4. Rio Salado ends in the Parana River, and during the summer in the southern hemisphere, abundant rainfall in Santa Fe Province can cause these rivers to overflow their banks producing at times extensive floods (http://www.foei.org/en/who-we-are/testimonies/latin-america/roque).

Please see prior ProMED-mail posts below that have reported on recurrent outbreaks of leptospirosis in Santa Fe Province and the adjacent Entre Rios Province associated with flooding after heavy rainfalls (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12415894) and infestation with _Leptospira_-infected rodents (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12038040 and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12900160).
