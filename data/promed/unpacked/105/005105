The Wyoming Game and Fish Department said on Friday [5 Nov 2021] that a disease outbreak at the Sheridan Bird Farm in spring 2021 will result in fewer pheasants being released at hunting areas in northern Wyoming this fall.

About 18 800 healthy chicks were hatched and placed into brooding facilities this spring, but signs of disease were subsequently discovered over Memorial Day weekend, and Sheridan Bird Farm Supervisor [DM] and Game and Fish Veterinarian Samantha Allen collected chicks for disease testing.

"Resulting lab tests confirmed enteritis was the culprit, caused by a bacterial infection," Game and Fish said. "This contributed to the pheasants developing rickets as well."

"In this case, a bacterium called _Salmonella_ (from group E) was identified. _Salmonella_ is one of many common bacteria inhabiting livestock and poultry areas but can suddenly erupt and cause illness in young animals. It is treated with common antibiotics and Vitamin D to strengthen the immune system. Once its presence was confirmed, all the pheasants were immediately placed on medications and supplements."

Despite efforts to treat the chicks, Game and Fish said about 1/3 of the 18 800 died.

"In the 84 years Sheridan Bird Farm has raised pheasants, there have only been a few outbreaks like this," [DM] said. "During my 26-year tenure, I've never been so sad and disappointed. We take great pride in raising and releasing as many pheasants as possible for the hunters in Wyoming. It was a hard year for us, and we learned a lot. I can't thank our veterinary and lab personnel enough. It certainly could have been worse, but changes have been made to make it difficult for this to happen again."

The department notes the _Salmonella_ outbreak should not be a human health concern for hunters this fall, but hunters are regardless encouraged to practice safe handling and hygiene practices such as wearing plastic gloves when handling wildlife.

The pheasants at the Sheridan Bird Farm who survived the disease outbreak "have recovered well and are healthy," according to Game and Fish.

"Bird farm staff have begun stocking birds at 11 locations on a rotating weekly basis and will continue for the duration of pheasant season," Game and Fish said. "However, the number of birds released at each stocking will be reduced."

The department notes the Downar Bird Farm near Torrington did not experience a disease outbreak this year [2021]. About 18 000 pheasants will be released at hunting areas in southern Wyoming this fall from that farm.

["Importance
Fowl typhoid and pullorum disease . . . are among the most important diseases of poultry. Pullorum disease is usually symptomatic only in young birds, while fowl typhoid also affects growing and adult poultry. The severity of these diseases can vary, depending on several factors including the bird's breed, but mortality rates can approach 100% in highly susceptible birds. Fowl typhoid and pullorum disease are still common in some regions, although they have been eradicated from commercial poultry in many countries with highly developed poultry industries, such as the US, Canada, Australia, and most nations in Europe. Even in these areas, however, the causative organisms may persist in backyard poultry flocks and game birds. They are particularly difficult to control in game birds, which are often reared in semi-wild production systems. Outbreaks also occur occasionally in commercial poultry, and there are some concerns that exposure might increase with the increased demand for free-range birds.

"Etiology
Fowl typhoid and pullorum disease are caused by 2 different biovars of _Salmonella enterica_ subsp. _enterica_ serovar Gallinarum, a Gram-negative bacterial rod in _Salmonella_ serogroup D (non-flagellated organisms with O antigens 1, 9, and 12) in the family Enterobacteriaceae. _S. enterica_ subsp. _enterica_ serovar Gallinarum biovar Gallinarum, which causes fowl typhoid, is usually abbreviated as _Salmonella_ Gallinarum, and _S. enterica_ subsp. _enterica_ ser. Gallinarum biovar Pullorum as _Salmonella_ Pullorum. Organisms that seem to have characteristics of both biovars have occasionally been reported.

"Species affected
_Salmonella_ Pullorum and _Salmonella_ Gallinarum are considered to be highly adapted to birds. They usually cause illnesses in chickens, turkeys, and game birds (e.g., pheasants, quail, guinea fowl, partridges, peacocks), but clinical cases caused by one or both organisms have also been reported in ducks, geese, pigeons, various psittacines, sparrows, starlings, and other birds. Isolates found in game birds include some organisms that are shared with poultry and others that seem to be maintained in game birds, such as _Salmonella_ Pullorum phage type 7, which has been detected in pheasants but not poultry."

"Clinical signs
Pullorum disease is mainly seen in young birds. In poultry, this disease usually affects chicks less than 3-4 weeks of age, with peak mortality around 2-3 weeks. If birds are hatched from infected eggs, some embryos may die in the egg, and dead and dying chicks can be found soon after hatching. Recently hatched birds have nonspecific signs of acute septicemia such as depression/somnolence, weakness, loss of appetite, drooping wings, huddling, labored breathing, dehydration, and ruffled feathers. Diarrhea, which is usually white and viscous, is common, and fecal pasting is frequently seen around the vent. The course of the disease can be less acute in older chicks, and arthritis affecting various joints, especially the hock, has been described in some outbreaks. In some instances, it was the most prominent sign in the affected flock. Blindness has also been reported. Birds surviving pullorum disease may be underweight and poorly feathered, and they may not mature into productive adults. Infections in poultry more than 4 weeks of age are usually inapparent, although there are occasional reports of an illness similar to fowl typhoid. Decreased egg production, fertility, and hatchability of eggs can be seen in inapparent carriers.

"Fowl typhoid affects birds of all ages. As with pullorum disease, dead and dying chicks may be found soon after hatching. However, this disease is common in older birds. Depression, decreased appetite, weight loss, dehydration, ruffled feathers, and watery to mucoid yellowish diarrhea are common clinical signs in poultry and game birds. Respiratory distress may also be seen. Egg production usually decreases, and decreased hatchability and fertility may be noted. A progressive loss of condition in birds that survive longer can lead to anemia with pale, shrunken combs and wattles. There may also be outbreaks with atypical syndromes. One outbreak in quail was characterized by decreased egg laying and high mortality, but few birds had any clinical signs."

"Treatment
Various antibiotics can be used to treat clinical cases, but they do not eliminate _Salmonella_ Gallinarum and _Salmonella_ Pullorum from the flock. Antibiotic resistance including multi-drug resistance has been reported, and it seems to be increasing in frequency."

This is a tragic event for these raisers, for the birds and for the hunters. We wish the hatchery a speedy and thorough recovery. - Mod.TG
