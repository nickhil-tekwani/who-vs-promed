Headlines
- It is with profound sorrow that the WHO announces the sudden demise of Dr Peter Salama, who passed away on [24 Jan 2020]. Dr Salama contributed to polio eradication at WHO through his work as executive director of the Health Emergencies Programme and most recently as executive director of the Division of Universal Health Coverage - Life Course [read more at: https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/24-01-2020-who-mourns-passing-of-dr-peter-salama].

[Once again, the weekly report has a significant number of newly confirmed cases, most of which still have dates of onset in 2019, bringing the global total number of WPV1 (wild poliovirus type 1) associated cases in 2019 up to 168, and 4 confirmed cases with dates of onset in 2020. According to this report, Pakistan has confirmed a total of 139 of the 168 cases (82.7%) of all WPV1 cases in 2019, and all 4 of the confirmed cases in 2020.

With respect to VDPVs (vaccine derived polioviruses), there were 302 cases reported with dates of onset during 2019, the highest number reported in recent years (see http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/this-week/circulating-vaccine-derived-poliovirus/.

The weekly confirmations included: Pakistan (6 WPV1 cases and 4cVDPV2 cases), DR Congo (2 cVDPV2 cases), Angola (15 cVDPV2 cases) and the Philippines 1cVDPV1 case. Positive environmental samples were found in Afghanistan (3 WPV1), Pakistan (10 WPV1 and 1 cVDPV2), Nigeria (2 cVDPV2), Somalia (3cVDPV2) and Ethiopia (1cVDPV2).

Conclusion, both WPV1 and cVDPVs continue to be transmitted. Or put another way, transmission of the WPV1 in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and cVDPVs in multiple countries in Africa and the western Pacific, has not been interrupted as yet. See the following sections and moderator comment addressing the continued identification of cases in Pakistan.

For a map showing the locations of both WPV-associated cases and cVDPV-associated cases, see http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/.

As in previous posts, to visualize all of this activity, I am including links [below] to HealthMap/ProMED-mail maps of countries with poliovirus activity during the past 2 years. The size of the list remains impressive, now with 24 countries: 15 in Africa, 5 in Asia, and 4 in the Western Pacific, with either WPV or cVDPV isolates in their countries. An important reminder is that positive environmental samples means that the virus is circulating in the area where the samples have been obtained. Hence, if a susceptible individual is infected with the virus, there is a chance the person may develop paralytic disease.

[2] Draft resolution to Executive Board on cVDPV2 endgame strategy
Date: 29 Jan 2020
Source: WHO draft proposal for WHA 2020 [edited]
http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/EB146/B146_21Add1-en.pdf


The Executive Board is invited to consider the following draft decision:

The Executive Board, having considered the report on poliomyelitis: polio eradication; 1) noting with great concern the evolving public health emergency associated with the increase in new emergences due to circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2, particularly in parts of Africa; and noting the development of the draft Strategy for Control of cVDPV2 2019-2021, an addendum to the Polio Endgame Strategy 2019-2023. 2) to more effectively address the evolving circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 epidemiology, decided:

(1) to request the director-general to: (a) continue to ensure adequate and uninterrupted supply of oral polio vaccine type 2 to respond to such outbreaks, in line with existing mandates; (b) accelerate the assessment and roll-out of a novel oral polio vaccine type 2 including through the WHO Emergency Use Listing procedure; (c) initiate a transparent and evidence-based process for prioritizing the equitable allocation of limited supplies of novel oral polio vaccine type 2; and,

(2) to urge member states to: (a) expedite the processes for authorizing the importation and use of vaccines to respond to polio outbreaks, including novel oral polio vaccine type 2 on the basis of its emergency use listing; and (b) mobilize domestic financial resources to complement international financial and political commitments.

[The above draft proposal is directed at the major increase in cVDPV2 and the proposed necessary actions in order to achieve the goal of polio eradication globally. There are many expectations of the novel OPV2 currently under development, especially with respect to stability following multiple passages in humans, the route that has led to the cVDPV2s globally. It is too soon to know the outcome when going from a small number of vaccinees during the clinical trials to using it on millions of individuals in much of Africa and other countries with cVDPV2 outbreaks (including Pakistan). - Mod.MPP]

https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2020/01/29/three-more-polio-cases-emerge-in-different-provinces/


Three more cases of poliovirus were reported from Sindh, Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) on Wednesday [29 Jan 2020], taking the total number of cases to 6 in the current year [2020].

According to officials of the Health Ministry, poliovirus was detected in a 26 month old child in Jumo Agham Union Council of Sindh's Ratodero. The blood sample of the child had been collected on [24 Dec 2019].

In KP, an 11 month old child was found to be infected with the disease in Tank district. Sources said that the parents of the child had refused the administration of the polio vaccine to the infant.

The 3rd case was reported from Balochistan where a 20 month old child was diagnosed with the disease in Sikandarabad Union Council of Balochistan's Dera Murad Jamali. The child had been vaccinated against the disease thrice, and their blood sample was collected on [3 Jan 2020], but regardless, the child became infected. This was the 1st polio case in Balochistan during the current year.

On [11 Jan 2020], the United States generated a level 2 travel alert for Pakistan and other polio-endemic Asian countries following the outbreak of the crippling disease, declaring the life-time booster dose for adults mandatory during the period of restrictions imposed by WHO.

The United States has issued new guidelines for travelers bound for polio-endemic countries on the recommendations of its federal agency -- Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) -- to stop the spread of the virus to other states. "The WHO recommends that these countries require residents and long-term (4 weeks or more) visitors show proof of polio vaccination before leaving the country," the level 2 travel alert by the US had read. It said that before traveling to these countries, adults who have completed their routine polio vaccine series as children should receive a single, lifetime adult booster dose of polio vaccine.

According to CDC, polio outbreaks have been reported in 8 Asian countries, including Pakistan, Afghanistan, China, Burma, Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea and the Philippines. Particularly, WHO had extended travel restrictions on Pakistan following frequent outbreaks of vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) and wild poliovirus type 1 (WP1) cases. According to the US travel alert 2, CDC recommends that all travelers to the countries in question be vaccinated fully against polio.

Another 4 cases of polio, 2 each in Sindh and Punjab, have been found, an official of the National Institute of Health told Dawn. The samples of the patients were taken and referred to NIH last year [2019].

"A 5 year old boy, a resident of Deenpur union council (UC), Thull tehsil, Jacobabad district, became paralysed due to poliovirus. The other victim is a 48 month old boy, a resident of Phulladyon UC, Sindhri tehsil, Mirpurkhas district," the official said, requesting anonymity. "The children paralysed by poliovirus in Punjab are both girls, and they belong to the same district and UC. They are 4 and 10 months old, residents of Aali Wala UC, D.G. Khan tehsil," he said.

When contacted by Dawn, national coordinator [of the] Emergency Operation Centre for Polio, Dr Rana Safdar, confirmed that 4 new cases had been detected. "As we consider the date of collection of the samples for placing the cases in the year, all 4 cases have been placed in 2019, and the tally for the year has reached 144," he said.

Dr Safdar said that so far, 7 cases had been confirmed in 2020, and the last case for the current year [2020] was reported from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The patient is an 18 month old girl, a resident of Abba Khel UC, Lakki Marwat tehsil, he added.

[I am finding the media reports very difficult to decipher as to which of the reported cases had dates of onset during 2019 and which in 2020. For example, section [3] above, mentions 3 cases in 2020, one of whom (from Sindh) had blood samples (or should it read stool samples) collected on 24 Dec 2019, clearly a date of onset in 2019; the 2nd case (from KP) had no information on the timing of specimen collection, and the 3rd case (from Balochistan) had blood (stool?) sample taken on 3 Jan 2020 and could have had onset in 2020, or in 2019. But for all 3, the media reported the cases as 2020 cases.

A more reliable look at confirmed cases in Pakistan is to look at the End Polio Pakistan website (https://www.endpolio.com.pk/polioin-pakistan/polio-cases-in-provinces). If one looked at the website prior to the 29 Jan 2020 report, there had been a total of 139 cases of WPV1 confirmed with dates of onset during 2019, and 4 cases confirmed with dates of onset during 2020 (2 in Sindh and 2 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa). In addition, there had been 22 cases of cVDPV2 with onsets of paralysis during 2019.

Checking the End Polio Pakistan website today (3 Feb 2020) there have been a total of 144 cases of WPV1 with dates of onset during 2019, and 7 cases confirmed during 2020 (2 in Sindh, 4 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and 1 in Balochistan). The number of cVDPV2 cases remained at 22 during 2019, and none since the beginning of 2020.
