Fujian Strain of Influenza A (H3N2) Virus to be Included in the Southern
Hemisphere Vaccine
--------------------------------------------------
The influenza vaccine now being given was not developed to protect against
a strain of the virus [A/Fujian/411/2002(H3N2)] that has surfaced in this
country this fall, but the government is optimistic that this year's
vaccine will stave off outbreaks, a top federal health official said on Mon
17 Nov 2003. The reason is that animal studies suggest that the strain of
virus [A/Panama/2007/99] included in the vaccine is close enough to the new
one that the vaccine will still protect, said Dr. Julie L. Gerberding, the
Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta.
Still, she warned, that the United States could face a severe epidemic this
year, given that the influenza season began unusually early and has hit
Texas and Colorado particularly hard. "It's a little too early to say
whether or not this portends the worst influenza season we have had in a
long time," Dr. Gerberding said in a telephone news conference. She said
that she was "sounding the alarm" to urge more people to get influenza
vaccine shots to "nip this problem in the bud." The CDC do not know how
many people have received flu shots this season. "People have the
impression we are doing better this year than last year, but we do not have
the data to back that up at this point in time," she said. The influenza
vaccine includes 3 strains of influenza virus, but was not designed to
protect against a new one that has appeared in a number of countries over
the last year. It is known as the Fujian strain [A/Fujian/411/2002], a
variant of the Panama strain [A/Panama/2007/99] that is included in the
current vaccine. Both are categorized as H3N2 strains.
The influenza virus mutates frequently. Health officials change the strains
of virus put in the influenza vaccine each year as they try to keep up with
mutations. But matching strains in the vaccine with those circulating among
humans during a influenza season is a notoriously unpredictable exercise.
The World Health Organization committee that makes the recommendations for
the influenza vaccine knew about the Fujian strain in Feb 2003, said Dr.
Klaus Stoehr, an influenza expert at the organization. But Dr. Stoehr said
in a recent interview that the committee decided not to include the Fujian
strain [in the Northern Hemisphere vaccine] because [there was not
sufficient time to modify for inclusion in the current vaccine]. The
influenza vaccine is prepared in eggs. Decisions about the components of
the vaccine have to be made months in advance, in part because
manufacturers and farmers need to know how many eggs to prepare in
anticipation of demand.
Influenza typically occurs during the winter in each hemisphere, and the
vaccines are prepared at different times. The vaccine being prepared for
use in the Southern Hemisphere will include the Fujian strain, Dr. Stoehr
said. "There may be less than optimal protection against H3N2 virus" in the
Northern Hemisphere, "but no vaccine failure has been reported" there, he
said. "So there is no reason to discourage people from getting vaccinated."
Dr. Gerberding said it was common for the circulating influenza to
gradually change genetically ­- known as "drift" -­ as it spread to infect
more people. Tests at the center found that 84 percent of the 55 strains of
influenza virus isolated this fall are the Fujian strain, Dr. Gerberding
said. But she emphasized that protection could still occur even without a
perfect match.
Dr. Gerberding said that an earlier than usual onset of influenza had
occurred in some European countries but that "this is not a pandemic."

[The Fujian strain of influenza A (H3N2) virus appears to be the currently
predominant strain in the USA and Europe. The Panama strain, which is a
constituent of the current vaccine, is responsible for the current outbreak
in western Canada. Although there is believed to be sufficient antigenic
cross-reactivity between the Fujian and Panama strains for the existing
vaccine to be protective, it has been judged prudent to replace the Panama
strain with the Fujian strain in the new Southern Hemisphere vaccine,
although the Panama strain is still in circulation in some places. - Mod.CP]
