[Minnesota] state health officials said [Tue 13 Aug 2019], 3 children are sick from _E. coli_ bacteria after swimming in a Minneapolis lake. The children have tested positive for the same strain of _E. coli_ after swimming at Lake Nokomis beaches between [26 Jul and 2 Aug 2019]. 2 beaches of the lake are closed until further notice, the Minnesota Department of Health said. The children, all under the age of 10, were not hospitalized.

Minneapolis Park Board Superintendent Al Bangoura said it's the 1st time someone has fallen ill after swimming in a Minneapolis lake in more than 20 years. "We take this very seriously and are working closely with the Minnesota Department of Health as they conduct their investigation," Bangoura said in a news release.

Symptoms of illness caused by _E. coli_ bacteria include stomach cramps and diarrhea, with mild or no fever. People typically become ill 1 to 8 days after exposure. It's rare, but the infections sometimes lead to a serious complication involving kidney failure. Health officials say children younger than 10 years old, the elderly, and those with weakened immune systems have a higher chance of developing complications from _E. coli_ infections.

"This is also an important reminder that anyone who is experiencing diarrhea should not go swimming while they are sick," said Trisha Robinson, waterborne disease supervisor at the Health Department.

Officials also want to hear from anyone else who may have become ill after swimming in Lake Nokomis.

"If there are other people who have gone swimming and are concerned about their symptoms of illness, we very much encourage them to contact their health care providers," Robinson said.

[It is important to understand that there are many different kinds of _E coli_. The organism is an important component of the human intestinal tract and can perform important functions helpful to its host. These strains can cause human infections if they "escape" from the usual location into the urinary tract, gall bladder, or abdominal cavity. They are also what are mentioned when a beach is closed for _E. coli_ contamination. In this circumstance, officials are measuring the organism or "coliforms" in the water to reflect human sewage contamination.

Additionally, there are some strains of _E. coli_ that can produce toxins that can produce diarrhea, and much of so-called travelers' diarrhea is caused by these strains. All of these strains are human bacteria, not zoonotic organisms, that is, not spread from animal hosts. One _E. coli_ group called Shiga toxin producing or enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC) is the organism likely to be involved here, are zoonotic. Spread in a number of ways, including via undercooked ground beef, contaminated vegetables, and direct or direct contact with farm animals including contaminated water, EHEC can cause significant disease and even death.

In the spring of 2000, in Walkerton, a town of 5000 in southern Ontario, an outbreak of _E. coli_ O157:H7 infection claimed 7 lives -- 6 adults and a child -- and over 200 were seen at local area hospitals.
