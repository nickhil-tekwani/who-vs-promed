Due to infectious anemia, another horse put down
------------------------------------------------
Another horse in Bavaria was put down because it has been diagnosed
with equine infectious anemia (EIA). The horse was kept on a holding
in Hausen/Rieden (Wuerzburg), and has tested positive for the virus
only one week after the 1st case in Bavaria (Main-Spessart region)
had been confirmed.

The positive animals detected so far in Hessen (6 cases),
Northrhine-Westfalia (1 case) and Bavaria (1 case) are considered to
have been imported illegally from Romania. The latest case however is
a [local?] horse that has shared a stable with one of the infected
animals earlier this year.

The results on a 2nd horse under investigation are awaited.
