A 2-year-old Gloucester County filly is the 1st reported case in 2015 of Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), a serious, mosquito-borne illness in horses. The horse, which had not been vaccinated against EEE, was humanely euthanized on 25 Aug [2015]

"Horse owners need to be vigilant in vaccinating their animals against diseases spread by mosquitoes," said New Jersey Secretary of Agriculture Douglas H. Fisher. "Vaccinated animals are much less likely to contract deadly diseases such as EEE and West Nile virus."

EEE causes inflammation of the brain tissue and poses a significantly higher risk of death in horses than West Nile virus infection. The disease is transmitted by mosquito bite. The virus cycles between birds and mosquitoes with horses and humans being incidental hosts

EEE [virus] infections in horses are not a significant risk factor for human infection because horses (like humans) are considered to be "dead-end" hosts for the virus. [Although not a direct human risk factor, these equine cases indicate that active EEE virus transmission is occurring in the area, and people should avoid mosquito bites. - Mod.TY]

In 2014, New Jersey had 4 [equine] cases of EEE.

Effective equine vaccines for EEE are available commercially. Horse owners should contact their veterinarians if their horses are not already up-to-date on their vaccinations against EEE.

The Texas Animal Health Commission [TAHC] recently received confirmation from the Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory of Texas horses testing positive for Eastern equine encephalitis [virus infections]. The infected horses are located in: Newton, Orange, Liberty, Jasper and Jefferson counties. To date, there are a total of 5 positive EEE cases in Texas.

TAHC officials remind equine owners to consult with their private veterinary practitioner regarding vaccinating their horses against mosquito-borne illnesses such as Eastern equine encephalitis, Western equine encephalitis, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, and West Nile virus.

Eastern equine encephalomyelitis is a mosquito-borne viral disease of all equine species. Infected horses may suddenly die or show progressive central nervous system disorders. Symptoms may include unsteadiness, erratic behavior and a marked loss of coordination. The death rate for animals infected with EEE is 75 to 100 percent.

Mosquitoes most often transmit the [virus that causes the] disease after the insects have acquired the virus from birds. Humans also are susceptible when bitten by an infected mosquito, but direct horse-to-horse or horse-to-human transmission is very rare. Symptoms in horses vary widely, but all result from the degeneration of the brain. Early signs include fever, depression and appetite loss.

"Vaccines are available for neurologic diseases such as EEE and WEE. As part of routine equine health care, we strongly recommend that equine owners consult with their local veterinarian to discuss an appropriate vaccination program to protect their horses against mosquito-borne diseases such as these," said Dr. Andy Schwartz, TAHC Assistant Executive Director.

[It is indeed unfortunate when owners of equine animals do not protect their animals by routine vaccination. These cases were preventable, and their loss far outweighs the cost of vaccination. Often, the neurological sequelae in animals recovering from EEE virus infections are so severe that euthanasia is required. Information about EEE virus vaccination is covered in the comment in ProMED-mail archive no. 20150820.3590391]. EEE virus is endemic in the eastern and upper Midwestern states of the USA.
