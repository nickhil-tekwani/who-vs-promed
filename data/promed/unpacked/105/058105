Deadly Ebola virus spreads to 2nd center in eastern Congo
----------------------------------
Congolese officials in eastern Congo say the Ebola virus disease epidemic has spread to a 2nd center after a woman was contaminated during the funeral of a victim of the disease and travelled back to her home. The health officials say 15 people have died since the beginning of the epidemic.

Congolese authorities are warning the population of the risks linked to the washing and displaying of dead bodies, a tradition that is widespread in Africa. The practice facilitates the spread of the deadly hemorrhagic fever. Around 170 people are currently under surveillance after they came into contact with infected patients.

Ebola virus disease was first discovered in Congo in 1976 and has no cure. The disease [may] causes severe internal bleeding and is fatal in 40 percent to 90 percent of cases.

[In the preceding WHO update it was stated that as of 3 Sep 2012, a total of 28 (8 confirmed, 6 probable, and 14 suspected) cases including 14 deaths had been reported from Haut-Uele district in Province Orientale. The reported cases and deaths have occurred in 2 health zones -- 18 cases, including 11 deaths in Isiro and 10 cases, including 3 deaths in Viadana.
