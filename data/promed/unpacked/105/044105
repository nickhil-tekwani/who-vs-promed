Fisheries officials have started an investigation to discover what is
killing thousands of tonnes of pilchards along the South Australian coast.
Fisheries SA was swamped yesterday with calls from the public reporting
dead pilchards along Adelaide beaches, from Christies Beach to Victor
Harbor and north of Whyalla. The new deaths come about a week after about
40 tonnes of dead pilchards were found in Spencer Gulf. Fisheries SA used a
spotter plane along much of the suburban coast and around Eyre Peninsula
yesterday in an attempt to quantify the number of fish killed.
Fisheries SA's director, Dr Gary Morgan, said that while the deaths so far
were few compared with the pilchard deaths of 1995-96, the situation was
being monitored "very closely". He said the possibility was increasing that
a virus was killing the fish - and not an "upwelling" of cold water from
the Southern Ocean. "These deaths do not completely discount the upwelling
theory but we are now more concerned that it is a virus," he said. "This is
a much smaller event than in 1995-96, but the deaths yesterday along the
southern beaches means it is more widespread than last week."
Tests being carried out in Victoria on dead pilchards sent last week are
expected to be completed by the end of this week.
