It is important to remember that not all acute central nervous syndromes in children are inflammatory or infectious. A number of years ago an acute encephalopathy syndrome was endemic in many tropical countries. In India it was referred to as "Jamshedphur fever" (Br med J 1955: 2: 1298-308) with subsequent reports noting its similarity to Reye syndrome -- a syndrome of acute cerebral edema with microvesicular fat deposits in the viscera (Indian J Med Res 1969: 57: 1865-71; Clin Pediatr 1972; 11: 128-30). Similar syndromes were noted in Indonesia, Brazil, and East Africa.

In the province of Udorn, northeastern Thailand, of 3000 children admitted to the provincial hospital during 1969, we observed at least 83 children with the clinical features of acute encephalopathy (Pediatrics 1971; 47: 707-16). 46 died, all within 72 hours of the onset of symptoms. The disease was characterized by the sudden onset of fever, vomiting, and headaches progressing to seizures and coma. Almost all children were less than 6 years of age and the majority of cases occurred during the late rainy season (August to October). This area is also endemic for JEV and without autopsy and laboratory data it would have been easy to confuse this syndrome with acute infection.

The histopathologic features from autopsies conducted on 40 children has been reported (Amer J Clin Path 1971; 56: 558-71) and were characterized by those findings associated with acute Reye syndrome. The latter report also details the evidence pointing to acute aflatoxin poisoning as the etiology of the condition in Udorn.

Subsequent private communication indicated to me that by the 1980s "Udorn encephalopathy" had disappeared from northeastern Thailand, for unknown reasons. It would be of interest to learn what the subsequent experience in India was with Jamshedphur fever, if known. In any event, the syndrome being reported as AES in India is not inconsistent with an acute encephalopathy and should be explored for this possibility.

Finally, note is made of a syndrome reported from Viet Nam referred to as "Litchi-associated" encephalitis (Emerg Infect Dis. 2012; 18: 1817-24). It is described as a seasonal, acute syndrome in children during the rainy season with a 25 per cent mortality and cerebral edema as an important component. It would be of obvious interest to know whether autopsy data have found changes consistent with those of Reye syndrome.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Olson for his comments and suggestions. Clearly, the list of possible etiological agents and factors for cases of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) should be expanded.

ProMED-mail would appreciate the response to Dr Olson's question -- what has been the experience in India with Jamshedphur fever? Have AES cases in Uttar Pradesh been tested for acute aflatoxin poisoning?
