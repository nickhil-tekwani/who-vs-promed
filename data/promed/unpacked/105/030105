High school wrestling has been suspended across the state due to a
widespread outbreak of a skin infection, the Minnesota State High School
League announced on Tue 30 Jan 2007.
Twenty-four cases of herpes gladiatorum, spread by direct skin-to-skin
contact, have been reported by 10 teams. Symptoms have included lesions on
the face, head and neck of wrestlers.
The League has banned competitions and direct contact between wrestlers in
practice from Tue 30 Jan 2007 until Tue 6 Feb 2007.
Officials first became aware of the outbreak after a tournament in
Rochester [Minnesota] in December. The Minnesota Department of Health has
been tracking the outbreak, caused by human herpesvirus 1.

[Skin infections caused by human herpesvirus 1 (formerly known as herpes
simplex type 1 virus) are not uncommon among wrestlers and others engaged
in contact sports. In the case of wrestlers the condition is known as
herpes gladiatorum. As recently as early December 2006 a high school
wrestling tournament in New Jersey was disrupted by an outbreak affecting
several wrestlers (see ProMED-mail reference below).
No specific strain of the virus has been associated with these outbreaks.
The current outbreak in Minnesota is noteworthy on accounts of its extent.
The literature has been reviewed recently by Turbeville SD, Cowan LD, and
Greenfield RA. (Am J Sports Med. 2006 Nov;34(11):1860-5. Mar 27 2006).
Anderson (Jpn J Infect Dis. 2006 Feb;59(1):6-9, Feb 2006) has described the
prophylactic use of valacyclovir (an inhibitory nucleoside analog prodrug)
to prevent outbreaks of primary herpes gladiatorum at a 28-day wrestling
camp. At the beginning and end of camp, IgM and IgG anti-HSV-1 antibodies
were collected. Out of 332 male wrestlers, aged 13-20, who entered camp, 94
elected to participate in blood sampling. Sixty-four were on antiviral
medication. Among the 94 wrestlers, 28 (29.8 percent) had positive IgG
anti-herpesvirus 1 titers. Of this group, 66 of 94, were human herpesvirus
1 IgG seronegative. At the end of camp, 55 of these original seronegative
individuals elected to participate in blood sampling and none had
detectable IgM anti-human herpesvirus 1 or 2 antibodies. Compared to
previous years without antiviral usage, introducing prophylactic
valacyclovir reduced clinical HG outbreaks by 87 percent at this 28-day
wrestling camp.
Due to the high prevalence of this virus in high school wrestlers, Anderson
recommended that serological testing should be done at the beginning of
each season. HSV-1 seropositive individuals should consider being on
antiviral medication throughout the season to minimize the risk of
transmitting the virus to other wrestlers. - Mod.CP]
