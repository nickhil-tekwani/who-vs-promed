"[Duane Gubler also responded to my question, saying that there are three
excellent natural experiments with _Aedes albopictus_ and dengue, four if
you count Brazil. Hawaii and Guam have had only _Ae. albopictus_ for more
than 50 years, with no _Ae. aegypti_. Although epidemic dengue has
occurred all around them on islands where _Ae. aegypti_ was present,
neither has had an outbreak of dengue since 1944. Taiwan is another case
in point. _Ae.aegypti_ occurs only in the south of the island; _Ae.
albopictus occurs all over the island. The epidemics of dengue in Taiwan,
since reintroduction of dengue in 1981, have all been in the south. In
1996 and 1997, there was local transmission of dengue in Taipei where only
_Ae. albopictus_ supposedly occurred, but the cases were sporadic and few
in number."
I am sure Duane was referring to the island of Oahu when he stated that
_Ae. aegypti_ had been absent from "Hawaii" for more than 50 years.
Actually, R.O. Hayes, R.D. Spadoni, and I collected _Ae. aegypti_ 30 years
ago along the Kona Coast of Hawaii (the Big Island) in January 1968. The
_Ae. aegypti_ Eradication Program was in progress at that time and Pat
Nakagawa, head of the state of Hawaii's vector control program, told us
that _Ae. aegypti_ had been eradicated from Maui, but that small pockets of
infestation still existed on Molokai and Lanai, and along the Kona Coast of
Hawaii. I do not recall the exact date when the last specimen of _Ae.
aegypti_ was collected in Hawaii, but, obviously, it was subsequent to
January 1968.
