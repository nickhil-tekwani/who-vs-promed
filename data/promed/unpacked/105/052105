The reference to pesticide treatment of crops at the end of the post
NEWCASTLE DISEASE, GAME FOWL, POULTRY - USA (CA) (09) Archive number
20030219.0434 left me somewhat confused.
Brief communication with USDA revealed that "PPQ (Plant Protection and
Quarantine) currently has a citrus quarantine in that area. It looks like
this article took information about the Mexican Fruit Fly control program
and inserted it in an article about the Newcastle Quarantine area."
The insecticide treatment is not related to END control, but is an entirely
separate effort directed against a completely different problem occurring
within the same geographic area. The events are unrelated.

[Our thanks to Dr. Gonder for pointing out the error in the newswire quoted
in our previous posting. The last 2 sentences in the post referred to above
were related to the use of a pesticide for the Mexican Fruit Fly and have
nothing to do with Newcastle disease. They should be ignored. We apologize
for the confusion. - Mod.DK]
