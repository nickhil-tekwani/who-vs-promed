Eight children and adolescents have been the fatal victims of rickettsia during this 2021 in Baja California. It is expected that this disease transmitted by ticks lurks more closely during these summer months. Daniela Miranda Guzman, a veterinarian attached to the Zoonosis program, explained that in the entity, 23 cases of rickettsiosis have been diagnosed, of which 8 died. The young population has been more vulnerable; the expert mentioned that the children and adolescents who were affected had a greater coexistence with their dogs, which carried the infected ticks.

"We are working intensively; we continue working. In the state we have sprayed 21 764 houses against the tick, and we have treated 17 000 pets against the tick," explained Miranda Guzman. "As of 21 Jun 2021, we have 23 positive cases in the state, and with 8 unfortunate deaths; 6 of these cases were in Mexicali, Guadalupe Victoria, Ejido Nuevo Leon, and in the Rio Hardy neighborhood.

"People still do not understand the magnitude of the problem, that living with ticks is not normal, and most of the positive cases that we have had in the state are minors, because they tend to live with the pet and a tick gets on them."

The veterinarian mentioned that they have detected an increase in the cases of rickettsia in the coastal area, since they are still not familiar with the disease and the measures to prevent it. "They have been 15-year-old girls, even 4-year-olds. In Tijuana we have a problem in the Maclovio Rojas area. The cases have been focused around the neighboring colonies. Of the positive cases, 6 or 7 are from that area," the vet added.

[The Rocky Mountain spotted fever rickettsia, _R. rickettsii_, is the cause of this illness, which is also referred to as febre maculosa, Sao Paulo exanthematic typhus, Minas Gerais exanthematic typhus, and Brazilian spotted fever. The organism, which is tickborne, is distributed through much of the USA including the Rocky Mountains and also parts of southern Canada, Central America, and South America.

It cannot be stressed enough that early recognition of this disease is quite important in minimizing morbidity and mortality. This is especially true in areas where the infection is not as classically known. The incubation period of the disease is about a week after the tick exposure, long after the tick has detached. The presenting illness is generally nonspecific, with fever, muscle pains, and headache (the headache is usually described as quite severe). The rash begins in day 3 of illness, initially maculopapular (an area that is red and has small, confluent bumps) at the wrists and ankles before becoming petechial (red or purple spots caused by minor hemorrhage) and purpuric (purple spots) involving the palms and soles, as well as spreading proximally to the truck. Purpura usually is not seen before the 6th day of illness. The mortality is indeed quite low if treatment (usually a tetracycline) is begun during the 1st 2 days of the rash or before.

Empiric treatment for this infection should always be begun in people with compatible symptoms inhabiting endemic areas during the spring and summer, even if no tick bite is known.
