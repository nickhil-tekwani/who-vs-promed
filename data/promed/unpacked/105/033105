Louse Flies (_Hippoboscidae_) Test Positive for West Nile Virus
---------------------------------------------------------------
A pool of Hippoboscid flies has tested positive for West Nile virus in
Dauphin Co (Pennsylvania). These flies are also called louse flies and are
ectoparasites on birds and mammals. We have no idea regarding the
importance of these insects because no work has been done with respect to
Hippoboscid vector competence for West Nile virus. If they are capable of
vectoring West Nile virus, they could be very important enzootic vectors in
the wild in roosting areas and among nest mates. Birds in captivity, such
as those in zoos and bird rehab centers, could also be disproportionately
affected. The flies were collected from a symptomatic Great horned owl.

[In response to a query for additional information on the identification of
West Nile virus in hippoboscidae, Michael Hutchinson was kind enough to
send the following. - Mod.MPP]

Thank you for your question about the positive louse flies. We have sent 3
pools of Hippoboscidae for West Nile virus testing. The first pool of 5-6
specimens was taken from a Red Tail (RT) hawk that tested positive for WN -
that pool tested negative. The second pool contained 5 specimens that were
collected from a symptomatic Great Horned (GH) owl. That is the pool that
tested positive through PCR as well as through virus isolation, indicated
the presence of live virus. This is not surprising in that the specimens
were visibly blooded. The results from a 3rd pool of non-blooded specimens
are still pending. Future submissions of Hippoboscids from symptomatic
birds will be held in the lab for 7-10 days to try to ensure complete
digestion of the blood meal. Positive results from non-blooded insects
will give us a better idea if the virus can survive within the louse
flies. We will still be in need of vector competency studies to nail down
the importance, or lack thereof, of this group. As for the question about
the identity if the flies, they are in the genus Icosta and I'm waiting on
literature to provide a species level identification. There are about 8
species in North America and they are bird biters.
