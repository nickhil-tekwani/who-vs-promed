Malaria cases on the rise in Goa, India
----------------------------------------
The coastal state expects to see a larger number of malaria cases after the free fall in the incidence over the past 5 years. From more than 6000 cases in 2007, the number dropped to barely 900 cases last year, the state directorate of health services reported. "But the bad news is that with 4months to go, we have already scaled last year's peak of 900 cases," Dr Sachin Govekar told reporters Tuesday [4 Sep 2012]. Dr Govekar is in charge of vector-borne diseases at the state directorate of health services.

What is worse, health authorities expect the number to climb in the monsoon, when mosquito infestation is higher. "In July, we had a tough time, there were lots of cases. In the backdrop of the monsoon showing a resurgence towards the fag end of August [2012], there is the possibility of more cases," Dr Govekar said.

Goa reported no malaria deaths this year. Last year, there were 2 deaths attributed to malaria.

High incidence of renal failure linked to falciparum malaria, Jharkand, Eastern India
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Doctors in Jharkhand have linked a high incidence of renal failure in the state with falciparum malaria, a particular strain of malaria prevalent in this part of the country, and have expressed concern over the lack of preparedness on the part of the government and private medical institutions in case of an epidemic.

While the premier medical institution of the state, Rajendra Institute of Medical Science (RIMS) in Ranchi, has no super-speciality department for treating problems related to the kidney, there are only five qualified nephrologists in the state and most renal cases are dealt by general physicians in both government as well and private medical institutions. Dr A K Mahato, head of the department of medicine at RIMS, admitted that a large number of patients suffering from various renal disorders visit the hospital every day. "At present, the hospital has 4 dialysis machines and there is a long queue of patients. We are in the process of procuring and installing more machines. Some new machines will be installed shortly," he said.

When asked about the reason for the increase in the number of kidney-related ailments in the state, Mahato said though diabetes and hypertension affect renal functions, the bulk of the new cases is directly linked to malaria and food adulteration. "Malarial infection involves the brain and the kidney. If left untreated, it often affects the kidney more," he said, adding that various dyes used in colouring vegetables and other food items also affect normal functioning of the kidney, leading to renal failure in some cases.

Dr Ghanashyam Singh, nephrologist at Apollo Hospital in Ranchi, said that since renal disorders do not have symptoms for early detection, most cases reach doctors when they are in advanced stages. "Neither the government nor private medical institutions have any facility or awareness about detecting renal problems early. A renal profile is essential if a patient has been infected with malaria falciparum," he said. Singh said that more than 30 000 dialysis procedures and 65 kidney transplants have been performed at their hospital over the past few years.

When asked if early detection of renal infection can prevent kidney failure, Singh said medication helps prolong the life of an infected kidney depending upon the stage in which the ailment is diagnosed. "If detected in the 3rd stage, a patient can be advised medication that delays the need for dialysis," he said.

Narendra Sinha, doctor of medicine at Apollo, said chances of recovery of the kidney in case of being affected by malarial infection are higher if properly diagnosed. "In case of malaria, early and proper treatment can avert chances of renal issues. Unfortunately, most malarial cases in Jharkhand are ignored set aside [sic] follow up diagnosis of kidney and its condition," he said.

One malaria case found every day in Indore, Madhya Pradesh
----------------------------------------------------------
Indore: At least one malaria patient is being identified every day in the district. So far, more than 290 patients have been identified, of which 33 are suffering from falciparum malaria.

As per the figures of the district malaria department, of these 290 patients, 95 normal malaria patients were identified through government facilities, while 166 normal cases were reported from private hospitals of the city. In case of falciparum malaria, only 2 cases were identified at government facilities against 31 cases at private hospitals. Falciparum malaria, which is commonly referred to as cerebral malaria, is the most dangerous form of malaria that can also lead to neurological abnormalities.

District malaria officer Dr MC Jinwal said, "This is the season when cases of malaria increase. We have increased our fever surveys and insecticide sprays."

The density of mosquitoes has also increased in the city. "The average mosquito density is hovering around 30-35 per cent as per the current estimate whereas it was just below 5 per cent in January," said Jinwal. "It is one of the reasons for the increase in cases of malaria in the district, though no deaths have been reported so far," he added. "Even in the positive cases which are detected from private hospitals, we are sending our teams to those areas for fever survey and insecticide spray, where these cases were detected," said Jinwal.

Malaria in Vadora, Gujarat
--------------------------
The health department in the city is on its toes for last month as the cases of malaria have been rising.

Irregular monsoons and cloudy weather in the city are being considered as the major reasons for the sudden rise in malaria and falciparum malaria. The government and private hospitals in the city are flooded with cases of the diseases.

In August, over 13 000 blood samples have been collected for malaria and falciparum malaria tests. Of the samples, over 380 have tested positive for malaria and 50 tested positive for falciparum malaria.

Malaria in Mangalore, Karnataka
-------------------------------
Mangalore City Corporation, MCC, will intensify the malaria eradication campaign
as the total number of malaria positive cases reported in the district crossed 4000 in the month of August [2012]. Out of the total malaria cases reported in the district, till July [2012], 85.6 per cent have been identified in the city limits alone.

According to sources in the District Vector Borne Disease Control Office, the total number of cases reported till the month of July [2012] is 3823. Out of the total positive malaria cases, 3272 have been reported in Mangalore City Corporation limits alone. In the month of July [2012], the cases reported in the city are 470, whereas the total cases reported in the other parts of the district is 131.

The city is also leading in the cases where the most dangerous form of malaria, _Plasmodium falciparum_, is identified. Out of the total 229 cases identified with _Plasmodium falciparum_ in the district during the year, 210 are in the city limits.

Eradication campaign
--------------------
The MCC has already appointed 42 multi-purpose workers (MSW) to find and destroy the breeding sites of Anopheles mosquitoes. MCC in-Charge Health Officer Dr Sudarshan said that the workers are appointed in each corporate ward under the Urban Family Welfare centre and are visiting 50-70 houses per day. So far, these workers have covered more than 70 000 houses since they started the operation in July [2012].

The hotel owners' association has donated a mobile unit to the MCC to conduct tests for hotel workers. The unit, under a retired health officer, will visit the hotels and check the workers. The Association is also providing mosquito nets to their workers.

Separate teams for construction sites
-------------------------------------
Since the main breeding ground for malaria has been identified as the various construction sites in the city, the Mangalore City Corporation (MCC) has formed 2 separate teams for inspecting construction sites. "Currently, 386 construction projects are going on in Mangalore. The teams are visiting these sites, inspecting them, destroying breeding sites and creating awareness among the workers," said Dr Sudarshan. "We have already asked construction site owners to provide proper facilities to the workers. If they fail in implementing the directions, we will take necessary actions," he added.

CREDAI to give 10 mobile units
------------------------------
MCC sources said that the Confederation of Real Estate Developers' Associations of India (CREDAI) has expressed their willingness to donate 10 mobile units, which will be exclusively for inspecting construction sites in the city. Each unit will have a retired health officer as in-Charge.

Single day campaign
-------------------
MCC Health department is also planning for a one-day awareness campaign with the help of National Service Scheme (NSS) volunteers. The campaign will cover all the houses in city in one day.
