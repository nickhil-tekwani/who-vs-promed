[A novel orthomyxo-like virus named tilapia lake virus (TiLV) has been described recently and found to be the cause of mortality of wild tilapia [the common name for nearly 100 species of (mainly freshwater) cichlid fish], first observed in the Sea of Galilee and in commercial ponds in Israel and Ecuador, and more recently in Egypt, Thailand, and Taiwan. Now it shows up in Peru.
