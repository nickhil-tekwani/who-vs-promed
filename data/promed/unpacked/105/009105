Tomato yellow leaf curl begomovirus, Israel strain (TYLCV-Is), a
geminivirus transmitted by the whitefly _Bemisia tabaci_, was first
described in 1964 from Israel, where it continues to be a limiting factor
in tomato production (Cohen & Antignus 1994).
>From discussions with tomato growers, it appears that TYLCV-Is was
unknowingly introduced by a tomato producer located in the northwestern
region of the Dominican Republic. This grower was producing tomatoes in a
greenhouse using a fresh-market, greenhouse cultivar which was only
available as transplants from Israel (Polston & Anderson 1997). The virus
was identified as TYLCV-Is in 1994 based on blot hybridizations, PCR, and a
partial genomic sequence (Polston et al. 1994, Nakhla et al. 1994).
TYLCV-Is was subsequently identified in Jamaica and Cuba (McGlashan et al.
1994, Gonzalez & Valdes 1995, Ramos et al. 1996). Symptoms of TYLCV were
reported to be present since 1987 in Cuba, although only since 1992 in the
Dominican Republic (Polston et al. 1994, Ramos et al. 1996). It is not
clear whether these epidemics are the result of separate introductions or
regional spread from a single introduction.
Recently, TYLCV-Is has also been reported for the first time from Portugal
(Louro et al. 1996), Spain (Navas-Castillo et al. 1997) and Florida (J. E.
Polston, ProMED-mail 980515225816).
