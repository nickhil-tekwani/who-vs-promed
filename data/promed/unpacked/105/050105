New York: Bronx Woman is 1st Case of West Nile Virus for 2003
--------------------------------------------------
An 86-year-old Bronx woman is the first human case of West Nile virus
infection reported in New York State in 2003, city and state health
officials said yesterday. The woman, who lives in Pelham Gardens, was
hospitalized 11 Aug 2003 after complaining of symptoms that included fever,
headache, muscle weakness, rash, and stiff neck. She was later found to
have encephalitis, city health officials said.
At a news briefing yesterday, City Health Commissioner Thomas R. Frieden
said that the woman was improving and remained in stable condition. She is
believed to have contracted the virus through a mosquito bite, and told
city health officials that she had not traveled recently outside the city.
In New York State, the 1st human case of West Nile virus was discovered in
1999, and since then, the number of cases has grown steadily. For instance,
there were 83 reported cases and 5 deaths in 2002, compared with 15 cases and
2 deaths in 2001, according to state health records.
Despite the recent heavy rains that have brought out mosquitoes this
summer, city and state health officials said that it was still too early to
tell whether there would be more West Nile cases than in previous years. In
the past, the first human case did not typically surface until mid-August,
and this year has been no different. Dr. Frieden said "Last year at this
time in New York City, we had the same number of human West Nile virus
cases. But only time will tell if we will have more cases this year than
last." But some experts said that there was no more than the usual danger
of contracting West Nile virus in 2003 because of the rainy weather.
Dr. Andrew Spielman, a public health entomologist and professor at the
Harvard School of Public Health in Boston, said that the main carrier of
West Nile virus, the common house mosquito, tends to breed in catch basins,
blocked drainage areas, and other places with "accumulations of foul water."
Frequent downpours, he said, would actually flush out those habitats, wash
away their eggs, and make it more difficult for them to breed. "They do
better if the rain is extremely intermittent," Dr. Spielman said. "If there
is frequent rain, they get washed away."
Dr. Frieden also pointed out that city health officials had been expanding
their mosquito prevention efforts, which includes spreading larvicide in
standing bodies of water like ponds and catch basins to kill mosquito larvae
before they become adults. This continued even during the blackout last
weekend, Dr. Frieden said.

Colorado: West Nile Virus Infection Detected in Alpacas
-------------------------------------------------------
West Nile virus has been found for the first time in alpacas in Colorado,
raising concerns that more animals than [previously] thought are vulnerable
to the disease. So far in 2003, 338 people in Colorado have been infected by
the mosquito-borne disease, and 7 have died. The virus has infected hundreds
of horses, donkeys, mules, and birds. Now, at least 2 alpacas in the Loveland
area have been infected. Several more have died, possibly from the virus,
said Wayne Cunningham, a state veterinarian."
Alpacas, native to South America and related to llamas, have long, fleecy
wool. Experts said they likely haven't developed resistance to the virus.
Dogs, cats, and pigs, which aren't tracked by the state, are probably
infected with West Nile at high rates, said Richard Bowen, a professor of
biomedical sciences at Colorado State University. Those animals usually
don't show symptoms of the illness and rarely die.
The impact on such animals as alpacas is probably small, said Nicholas Komar,
a research biologist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
Fort Collins. That's small comfort to Mark Miller. He owns Ausangate Alpaca
Ranch outside Loveland, and one of his 36 animals has been confirmed with the
WNV. Tests on 2 others are pending. The animals, used for breeding and wool,
are worth as much as $15 000 each. Miller said he has redoubled his efforts
to eliminate the stagnant sources of water around the ranch that attract
mosquitoes.
[During the 2002 outbreak season, West Nile virus infection of alpacas was
reported in Iowa (see ProMED-mail: "West Nile virus, mammalian host
range - USA 20021011.5517" and "West Nile virus, alpaca - USA (Iowa)
20020917.5333"). - Mod.CP]

Indiana: [Probable] Human Cases in Marion and 3 Other Counties
---------------------------------------------------
4 probable human cases of West Nile virus infection, including one in Center
Township, were reported on Wed 14 Aug 2003 by the Indiana State Department of
Health. Hoosiers [citizens of Indiana] from Allen, Lake, Marion, and
Switzerland counties have been infected with the virus, said Dr. James
Howell, the state's veterinary epidemiologist. If confirmed by tests done by
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, they will be Indiana's first
human cases in 2003.
Earlier this summer, a probable case reported in Allen County was eventually
ruled out as West Nile virus infection.
The 4 people believed to be infected are recovering, Howell said. They range
in age from 20 to 79. The state has investigated the cases for the past 3
weeks, Howell said, and is exploring others.
Rick Mack, a supervisor in the Marion County Health Department's mosquito
control program, said his office had known about the Center Township case
and already sprayed in a 1-mile radius around that person's home. Mack
wouldn't say when his office learned of the case. "We can't sit around and
wait for someone to confirm it," he said. "We had a heads-up that there may
be a case, so we took action." Workers also sprayed basins that collect
rain runoff within one mile of the home, Mack said. The mosquitoes that
most commonly carry West Nile virus breed in low levels of stagnant water
and often live in urban environments. In the past week alone, the number of
Marion County mosquito pools that tested positive has nearly doubled to 11.
"If it doubles again next week, we could really start to be in trouble,"
Mack said. "This is exactly the time that this virus starts to amplify."
The state reported its first human case last year on 9 Aug 2002. By summer's
end, 293 people were infected and 12 had died, 3 of them from Marion County,
according to the Marion County Health Department.

New Mexico: First Fatal West Nile Virus Infection in State
----------------------------------------------------------
A 78-year-old Chaves County man has died as a result of West Nile virus
infection, making it the 1st such death in New Mexico. State health officials
confirmed on Tue 19 Aug 2003 that tests confirmed the diagnosis. He had been
hospitalized for the last 2 weeks with encephalitis and died on Monday night.
The state also reported 15 new cases of the disease. New Mexico now has a
total of 24 confirmed cases of human West Nile virus infection. 14 of the 24
have had the severe form of the disease.

Idaho: West Nile Virus Infection Contracted in Colorado
-------------------------------------------------------
An Ada County man contracted West Nile virus infection while traveling
through Colorado in July 2003, officials say. The man was not hospitalized
and has since recovered from the virus infection. The 50-year-old decided
to get tested for the virus after he came down with body aches and a slight
rash, Central District Health officials told KTVB-Boise.
Officials said infected mosquitos have not been found in Idaho, through
they could arrive in 2003 or 2004. The insects are the primary carriers of
the virus.

Illinois: First Human Case of West Nile Virus Infection
-------------------------------------------------------
Health officials announced on Tue 19 Aug 2003 the first human case of West
Nile virus infection in Illinois and predicted more would appear in the state
that led the nation in human cases in 2002. A 69-year-old Champaign County
man is in the hospital after falling ill on 7 Aug 2003, according to the
Illinois Department of Public Health. An outdoorsman, he tested positive for
the mosquito-borne disease, according to the lab results from the health
department. Officials are waiting for final confirmation from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.
In 2002, Illinois had 884 reported human cases -- a nationwide high -- and
66 deaths.
