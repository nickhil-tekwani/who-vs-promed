[The current outbreak of HPAI in Niger (Tillabéri) was reported to have started on 23 Jan 2017 and to have been confirmed on 14 Feb 2017. However, this event was only officially communicated 2 months after confirmation -- a strain that is new to the country, and as such should have been communicated as soon as it was confirmed to allow those who raise or have poultry to enhance any preventive measures they may be able to apply.
