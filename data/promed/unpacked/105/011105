Anthrax kills Hong Kong boy, but no link to terror seen
-----------------------------------
Health officials announced here tonight the death of a 2-year-old boy from
anthrax, but said that the case did not appear to involve biological
terrorism.
The anthrax appears to have entered the boy orally, first affecting the
back of his throat, and does not appear to have been inhaled, said Dr. Tse
Laiyin of the Hong Kong Health Department's disease prevention and control
division. Terrorists would be more likely to disperse anthrax in such a way
that victims would inhale it, not ingest it, she said. "We have no evidence
that this is a biological attack," she said at a news conference this evening.
Anthrax is sometimes found in livestock but is rare in industrialized
areas, with only 3 cases reported here in the last 2 decades. The source of
the dead boy's infection is a mystery, with the boy's family and day care
center teachers and playmates showing no symptoms, Dr. Tse said.
The boy lived in a high-rise apartment building and had not visited any
farms or zoos or traveled outside Hong Kong recently. The boy suddenly came
down with a fever and what Dr. Tse described as anorexia on 27 May 2003. He
was taken to a hospital 3 days later with vomiting, shortness of breath,
and irritability, and died later the same day.
Not until today were tests completed confirming that anthrax was the cause
of death, Dr. Tse said. Hong Kong remains very much on the alert for new
outbreaks of disease because it had more cases of severe acute respiratory
syndrome [SARS] this spring, compared to the size of its population, than any
other large city in the world.

[The last livestock case of anthrax in Hong Kong was reported in 1982; the
last human case in 1997. Latterly human anthrax has been seldom reported in
the eastern and southern provinces of China. Oropharyngeal anthrax is
normally pretty gross and characterised by a great difficulty in breathing
because of the inflamed tissue; this child is described merely as having
"shortness of breath." This case would appear to follow the consumption of
raw or lightly cooked contaminated meat imported from the mainland or from
a backyard animal that had died unbeknown to the authorities. In southern
China porcine anthrax is the common form; there are also rural cases in
water buffalo. While anthrax is rarely reported in children, there is no
age resistance as such; it is just that children are seldom exposed. In this
case there may well be other cases in the apartment building related to the
original contaminated product or -- if it was something bought in a market --
in other customers and their families. - Mod.MHJ]
