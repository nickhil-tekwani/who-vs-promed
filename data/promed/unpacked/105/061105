An estimated 144 children have succumbed to nodding disease in Kitgum
and Pader districts, [members] from the Acholi [ethnic group]
Parliamentary group have said.

A survey by the Ministry of Health in November [2011] shows that Pader
District is the most affected with 1876 children affected by the
disease. The cases reported in Kitgum district have now reached 1278.
The legislators say that there are 94 deaths in Kitgum and 50 in Pader
district.

The team found out that there are certain beliefs about the disease in
the communities affected. Transmission is possible as children eat and
sleep together with already infected persons.

The communities also believe that the disease is spread through bites
of black flies. They also believe that a child suffers from the
disease when an infected person touches their head.

Now, the MPs led by Regan Okumu, chairperson of the Acholi
Parliamentary group are threatening to protest from the Ministry of
Health offices in Kampala on New Year's Eve [31 Dec 2011].

The MPS have appealed to World Health Organisation and Centers for
Disease Control in America to take action in respect of the disease.
Okumu warns that if the ministry does not take action the disease is
likely to spread further to other parts of Uganda. He wants a
humanitarian support center be set up in these districts to help
families access relief.

[ProMED-mail discussed the 1st report thoroughly in the comment to the
posting of 15 Dec 2011 (archive no 20111215.3605). We concluded that
both onchocerciasis and neurocysticercosis seem unlikely as they are
endemic and do not cause outbreaks with so many cases. We speculated
on a foodborne toxin as the most likely course. Please refer to that
comment for a review, which also includes reference to the literature
published on the syndrome since 1962.

So far, there have been no reports of clinical assessment of the
patients by a physician, no reports of CT or MRI scans, or findings
after a spinal tap. This information is vital to understand the
disease and its cause. ProMED-mail will be happy to post any
information available.
