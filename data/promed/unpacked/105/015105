Three recent wound botulism cases are linked to black tar heroin use, according to an alert issued Tue 10 Apr 2018 by the county Health and Human Services Agency.

In the past month, public health investigators have confirmed 2 cases and are in the process of confirming a 3rd among men aged 28, 42 and 67. Though the trio did not appear to know each other, each used black tar heroin.

They were hospitalized after experiencing a range of symptoms including double vision, drooping eyelids, difficulty swallowing, slurred speech, and generalized weakness. All 3 have required intensive care treatment with an anti-toxin that counteracts the effects of a neurotoxin produced by _Clostridium botulinum_, the bacterium that causes wound botulism. Left untreated, the condition causes progressive paralysis, starting with the face and moving toward the legs. Paralysis can eventually impair the function of breathing muscles, leading to respiratory failure and death.

Respiratory failure did occur in 2 of the 3 most recent cases in San Diego, and, in both cases, breathing tubes were necessary to keep the patients alive. San Diego County investigators have not identified any specific source of contaminated heroin used by the 3 men.

It is a common practice to heat or "cook" heroin as a way of killing possible contaminants, but, according to the CDC, this method is not guaranteed to eradicate botulism-causing bacteria. While stopping black tar heroin use is the best way to avoid wound botulism, those who don't quit can limit their risk by:

- Using only sterile needles and other equipment,
- Never sharing needles,
- Cleaning needles with bleach when unused needles are unavailable,
- Using sterile water to "fix" heroin before injection,
- Cleaning skin with a new alcohol swab before injection.

San Diego saw a cluster of 4 wound botulism cases in 2017 and 5 in 2010.

[The following is a discussion regarding black tar heroin, which, because of being injected intramuscularly, can subject the injected drug user to a number of infections, including botulism, tetanus, and necrotizing fasciitis http://www.drugaddictiontreatment.com/types-of-addiction/heroin-types-of-addiction/comparing-heroin-and-black-tar/:

"Black tar heroin is a type of illegal narcotic derived from morphine. Commonly called black tar heroin, heroin content is not actually what distinguishes this particular drug from other kinds of opiates. While black tar does contain an amount of heroin that can range from 29 to 80 percent, the drug is actually identified by the amount of comparatively crude derivatives of morphine that result from incomplete acetylation. Without delving into the chemistry too exhaustively, black tar is an unrefined product that is made without the complex equipment and chemicals necessary to produce heroin with a high level of purity. Black tar is manufactured primarily in Mexico, and is also commonly referred to as black, brown, manteca, night, or dark. It is also produced in smaller quantities in other parts of Latin America.

"Black tar use has spread throughout North America and can also be found in parts of Europe. Since the drug does not require the advanced equipment necessary to make pure heroin in white powder form, it is relatively cheap to manufacture and therefore cheap to purchase. It is less expensive to buy than white powder heroin, and it is much less expensive than commonly abused prescription opiates such as Vicodin or OxyContin.

"Black tar is distinct in appearance from white powder heroin. It ranges in color from black to light brown, and it is sold either as a cola-like chunk, a coarse powder, or a sticky substance with the consistency of melted tar, hence the name. Black tar can be injected in its tar-like form, snorted in its powder form, or smoked. The effects of black tar are similar to the effects of other kinds of opiates, and include feelings of euphoria, relaxation, loss of anxiety, and anesthesia. Side effects can include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and dry mouth.

"The most common method of using black tar is injection, and this method poses risks apart from the dangers of the drug itself. For one, black tar users frequently suffer from venous sclerosis, a condition in which the veins shrink and harden. It may become impossible for users to inject intravenously if they develop venous sclerosis, forcing them to resort to subcutaneous injection. However, this method includes its own risks, such as cellulitis and necrotizing fasciitis. When black tar users inject repeatedly, they put themselves at risk for contracting wound botulism due to the impurities and adulterants present in the drug. The sticky consistency of the drug may also put users at greater risk of HIV if they are washing needles and reusing them.

"The cheapness of black tar has helped to make it comparatively popular among young users who are inexperienced with drug use. Complications from drug use are more common when users are inexperienced. In addition, the impurities present in black tar, as well as the inconsistent ratio of heroin present in the drug, make overdose or death from complications due to the adulterants much more likely. Like all derivatives of morphine, black tar is extremely addictive. Dependency can occur after very few uses, and tolerance can also increase rapidly, causing users to experience irresistible cravings for increasingly large amounts of the drug." - Mod.LL
