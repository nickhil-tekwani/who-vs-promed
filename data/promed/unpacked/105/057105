Statement from the authorities in Maryland and Virginia
----------------------------------------------
The declaration "local transmission disproved" (ProMED-mail dated 25
Oct 2002; 20021104.5709) is a disservice to many in Maryland and
Virginia who have worked diligently to gather the best information
possible, to make the most careful analyses and interpretations, and
to seek confirmation of data and test results. There was no rush to
decisions based on preliminary data, and there has been no
precipitous public health action.
The facts are that Virginia and Maryland data show local transmission
of vivax malaria. The evidence for local transmission was clearly
described in CDC's MMWR report "Local transmission of Plasmodium
vivax malaria--Virginia 2002," Tuesday, 5 Nov 2002:
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5141a1.htm>
The evidence consists of 2 locally acquired cases of vivax malaria
and a remarkable abundance of competent malaria vector mosquitoes.
Cases occurred in Virginia, close to the southern side of the Potomac
River. The river environment is densely populated with people who
fish and recreate along the river at all hours, day and night. A
proportion of people using the river comes from other countries. A
study in Brazil has shown that asymptomatic cases are 5 times more
common than symptomatic cases, so we cannot dismiss an asymptomatic
carrier state.
Greatest human population density is on the Virginia side of the
river. The Maryland side is more rural and sparsely populated. A
ribbon of parkland borders the northern side of the river. There is
a large influx of immigrants into the region, many new arrivals being
from countries where malaria is indigenous. In 2001 there were 34
documented cases of imported malaria in Montgomery County (Maryland)
alone.
Case houses were about 7 miles from Dulles International airport.
The probability that a single mosquito was carried by plane then
traveled 7 miles to transmission sites and successfully transmitted
malaria to 2 individuals is exceedingly remote.
During this outbreak investigation, mosquitoes, _Anopheles
quadrimaculatus_ in particular, have been collected from many
localities, both north and south of the Potomac River and all
mosquito pools (hundreds of pools) have been tested. _Anopheles
quadrimaculatus_, which is historically the primary malaria vector in
this region, has been the overwhelmingly dominant mosquito in
Maryland collections since early August 2002. Most Maryland
collections were from north of the river, yet the 2 positives (from
separate nights' collections) were from the southern area in close
proximity to sites where collections in Virginia also were VecTest
positive. Mosquitoes collected in Loudoun County Virginia, in the
vicinity of the 2 malaria cases, and in other locations, were also
predominantly _Anopheles quadrimaculatus_.
Laboratories at Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences,
State of Virginia, and CDC are working on confirmatory testing and
every effort is being made to develop reagents and a standardized
approach to PCR testing of VecTest material. There have been
positive PCR results and, as an act of prudence, attempts are being
made to confirm the confirmatory results. However, the final
determination of VecTest positives is separate from the issue of
whether there was local transmission. After all, it is a sobering
possibility that the VecTest positive mosquitoes were true positives,
but unrelated to the 2 human cases. The epidemiological factors
listed above and cited in the CDC's MMWR of 5 Oct 2002 suggest that
local transmission of vivax malaria occurred in late summer on at
least 2 occasions on the Virginia side of the Potomac River.
