The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the [Hong Kong] Department of Health is today (20 Nov 2014) investigating a cluster of 3 cases of spotted fever affecting 3 men who hiked in Tai Lam Country Park [New Territories, Hong Kong] 18-19 Oct 2014, and hence appealed to members of the public to be vigilant against typhus and other rickettsial diseases.

The 1st patient is a 15-year-old man with good past health. He presented with fever, rash and skin ulcer over the right leg on 26 Oct 2014. He was admitted to Princess Margaret Hospital (PMH) on 30 Oct 2014. He has been in stable condition all along and was discharged on 3 Nov 2014.

The 2nd patient is a 16-year-old man with good past health. He presented with fever and rash on 2 Nov 2014. He was admitted to a private hospital on 6 Nov 2014 and had been in stable condition all along and was discharged on 14 Nov 2014.

The 3rd patient is a 43-year-old man with good past health. He presented with fever, rash and skin ulcer over the left knee on 25 Oct 2014. He was admitted to PMH on 30 Oct 2014 and had been in stable condition all along and was discharged on 10 Nov 2014.

Serology tests by the CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch confirmed that all 3 patients had spotted fever. Preliminary investigation revealed that the 3 patients hiked in Tai Lam Country Park with about 20 persons. The CHP is contacting them. Investigations are ongoing.

Spotted fever is transmitted by ticks, a vector which is usually found in scrubby areas or on rodents and stray animals that have been to scrubby areas. Most patients had history of outdoor activities in vegetated areas, for example, hiking in rural areas. The clinical presentation of spotted fever is fever, chills, headache, muscle pains and body rash. Spotted fever is characterized by a primary punched out skin ulcer corresponding to the bite site of the arthropod. Lymph nodes near the skin ulcer may be swollen and painful. In extreme cases, this disease may cause severe complications and can be fatal.

The incubation period of the disease is commonly 6 to 10 days. People who suspect they have spotted fever should consult doctors. Antimicrobials are effective treatment.

Information on spotted fever and vectors and vector-borne diseases can be obtained at the CHP website at http://www.chp.gov.hk/en/content/9/24/45.html and http://www.chp.gov.hk/en/view_content/33908.html.

[The illness could be scrub typhus, which is not tickborne. A tickborne spotted fever with a primary eschar as described here would not be caused by _Rickettsia rickettsii_, the cause of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, but rather another of the spotted fever rickettsia group that is associated with an eschar. ProMED would appreciate more information regarding the specific rickettsia involved. - Mod.LL
