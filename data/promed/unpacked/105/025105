Abstract
Long COVID is characterized by the emergence of multiple debilitating symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Its etiology is unclear and it often follows a mild acute illness. Anecdotal reports of gradual clinical responses to histamine receptor antagonists (HRAs) suggest a histamine-dependent mechanism that is distinct from anaphylaxis, possibly mediated by T cells, which are also regulated by histamine. T cell perturbations have been previously reported in post-viral syndromes, but the T cell landscape in patients who have recovered from mild COVID-19 and its relationship to both long COVID symptoms and any symptomatic response to HRA remains underexplored. We addressed these questions in an observational study of 65 individuals who had recovered from mild COVID-19. Participants were surveyed between 87 and 408 days after the onset of acute symptoms; none had required hospitalization, 16 had recovered uneventfully, and 49 had developed long COVID. Symptoms were quantified using a structured questionnaire and T cell subsets enumerated in a standard diagnostic assay. Patients with long-COVID had reduced CD4+ and CD8+ effector memory (EM) cell numbers and increased PD-1 (programmed cell death protein 1) expression on central memory (CM) cells, whereas the asymptomatic participants had reduced CD8+ EM cells only and increased CD28 expression on CM cells. A total of 72% of patients with long COVID who received HRA reported clinical improvement, although T cell profiling did not clearly distinguish those who responded to HRA. This study demonstrates that T cell perturbations persist for several months after mild COVID-19 and are associated with long COVID symptoms.

Significance of this study
- This observational study demonstrates clear symptomatic improvement in response to combined H1/H2 receptor blockade.
- Long COVID is associated with characteristic and specific alterations in circulating T cells that persist for up to 400 days after the initial COVID-19 infection.

T cell landscape is perturbed in long COVID. Furthermore, T cell flow cytometry could be developed to provide a rapid and straightforward diagnostic test for long COVID.

[I think it is worth quoting from the study design: "We recruited 49 patients with long COVID ('symptomatic group', symptoms >84â€‰ days following acute COVID-19 infection; physician or laboratory diagnosis) to undergo blood sampling to measure several hematologic and biochemical variables, and for flow cytometry. The tests were also offered to 16 volunteer clinician colleagues, all of whom had either PCR or serological evidence of COVID-19 and who had recovered uneventfully ('asymptomatic group')." Thus the paper does not imply that long COVID-19 occurs in 49 of 65 patients with initially mild COVID-19. - Mod.SH]

[2] Israel: Pfizer vaccine

The immunity provided by the COVID-19 vaccine from partners Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE weakens significantly within months, with men having less protection than women, according to research that supports the use of booster doses. Protective antibodies decreased continuously during the 6 months after the administration of the 2nd dose of the vaccine, according to a study of about 5000 Israeli health workers, published [Wed 6 Oct 2021] in the New England Journal of Medicine. The levels fell first at a sharp pace and later at a more moderate one.

Researchers worldwide are trying to identify the critical threshold of antibodies needed to prevent coronavirus infection, severe illness and death, said Gili Regev-Yochay, one of the authors of the study. Such studies will help assess risk levels for various groups and the measures needed to protect them, the researcher said.

Antibody levels were found to be lower in older people than in younger, and in immunosuppressed individuals compared to the healthy population, according to the study from Sheba Medical Center in Ramat Gan. Men's antibody counts were lower than those of women both at their peak and at the end of the study. The research shows why there are breakthrough infections in individuals who have had 2 vaccine doses, Regev-Yochay said in an online press briefing. The US, which has restricted its booster recommendation to older people and other vulnerable groups, will likely follow Israel's decision to offer a 3rd dose to the entire population, she said. "I would be more than surprised if we are not going to start to see a lot of breakthrough infections in the United States," among those who have received just 2 doses, Regev-Yochay said.

The Israel findings were bolstered by a 2nd real-world study from Qatar, published in the same journal, that found the efficacy of the Pfizer-BioNTech shot faded over a similar time period. Protection fell from 77.5% during the 1st month after the 2nd dose to 20% in months 5--7 after the 2nd dose. Still, the research found, prevention of severe and fatal infections remained strong throughout the study period, reaching 96% in the first 2 months after the 2nd dose and persisting at roughly this level for 6 months.

"The data is [sic] consistent," said Laith Abu-Raddad, a coauthor of the paper who studies infectious disease epidemiology at Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar. "Protection against hospitalization and death is really strong and more durable than protection against infection." Giving a 3rd booster shot helps optimize the protection from the vaccine, he said. Two other studies from Israel published in the journal also followed up on early reports of heart inflammation following vaccination. Cases of inflammation, called myocarditis, although rare, increased after the receipt of the vaccine, according to one study by the Israeli Health Ministry and Hadassah Hebrew University Medical Center, particularly after the 2nd dose among young male recipients. While cases were usually mild, one was fatal. Another study by the Clalit Health Services, the largest healthcare system in the country, found that the estimated incidence of myocarditis was 2.13 cases per 100 000 persons. The highest incidence was among male patients between the ages of 16 and 29. Most of the cases were mild or moderate.

[In the past 24 hours, 10 countries -- the USA (107 987), UK (39 527), Turkey (30 438), Russia (25 133), India (22 617), Brazil (18 440), Romania (14 744), Ukraine (12 662), Germany (11 604), and Iran (10 497) -- have all reported over 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 8743 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 4 Oct 2021 to late 5 Oct 2021). A total of 61 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 35 of the 61 countries from the European region, 7 from the Americas region, 6 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 5 from the South East Asia region, 6 from the Western Pacific region, and 2 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 7%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 6.8%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show an 11.6% decrease in daily reported cases and a 7.8% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 450 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 237.07 million cumulative reported cases and over 4.84 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
