[Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) subtype H5N1 continues to spread in West Africa (see ProMED posts listed below). Therefore, it should not be surprising that the disease has now been reported in Cote d'Ivoire. Establishing cooperative efforts between the affected countries in the area aimed at reducing the spread of the disease should be a priority.

Officially reported HPAI outbreaks (H5N1, H5N6, and H5N8 subtypes) in Sub-Saharan Africa, by date of onset (1 Oct 2020-11 Aug 2021), can be seen at http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/empres/HPAI_Africa/situation_update.html. This last FAO Sub-Saharan Africa HPAI situation update dated 11 Aug 2021, mentioned that in Cote d'Ivoire, "a refresher training was organized for field veterinary agents on sample collection and shipment for priority diseases including HPAI on 12-16 Apr 2021. Following the notification of HPAI in Senegal, Mauritania, Nigeria, Ghana and Togo, the focus of FAO ECTAD [Emergency Center for Transboundary Animal Diseases] Cote d'Ivoire is to increase awareness and vigilance in high-risk zones such as wild bird resting sites. As a result of increased active surveillance and vigilance in high-risk zones, information on suspected outbreaks including mortality of poultry was reported in the southeastern region of Grand Bassam during the Animal health technical working group meeting held on [5 Aug 2021]. FAO ECTAD Cote d'Ivoire is actively supporting national counterparts as per emergency request. Official communication on the situation is awaited." - Mod.CRD
