Live poultry markets, improper medical treatment blamed for high fatalities
in Indonesia
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Poor management of live poultry markets and inappropriate medical treatment
were the 2 main reasons why bird flu disease caused high fatalities in
Indonesia, an Indonesian bird flu expert told Xinhua on Thursday [31 Jan
2008]. Of 124 patients infected with bird flu disease in Indonesia since
2003, 101 [see above; now 102 - Mod.CP] have died so far.

High fatality rates in Indonesia, according to Professor Widya Asmara, a
member of experts panel for a committee to prevent bird flu pandemic, was
not caused by the resistance of the H5N1 virus against medicine, but rather
because most of the patients were late in getting appropriate medical
treatment. "Live bird markets are the place where the viruses gather. The
virus could spread to everywhere. We found many viruses, including on the
floor of the cages," Asmara told Xinhua. Should one chicken contracted with
the virus be brought to the market, the virus would spread to other
chickens, he said.

Most of patients, many of whom were traders rather than farmers, took
inappropriate 1st medical help, he said. They only went to see a doctor,
who might give wrong diagnosis. "With the initial symptoms, the doctor
usually thought that the patient suffered from a fever," the professor
said. They should go to a hospital which has better equipment and medicine,
he said. According to him, most of the bird flu patients in Indonesia got
medical treatment in hospitals after being treated at small clinics or by
doctors who operated at home or private places.

To prevent the prevalence of the bird flu disease, Asmara said, "the
chicken farm must be restructured and the live bird market must be
controlled. The markets should stop operating at least for one day, to be
disinfected so as to cut the life cycles of the virus."

Indonesian minister of agriculture Anton Apriantono told Xinhua on Thursday
[31 Jan 2008] that orders had been reaffirmed to the head of provinces of
Jakarta and neighboring Banten, where most of the bird flu cases occurred,
to keep the cleanliness and hygiene of the live poultry markets in their
territory. He said that the government had made procedures to prevent the
disease, but sometimes difficulties were on the level of implementation.

[The observation that the victims of bird flu have tended to be market
traders rather than farmers is interesting and deserves to be supported by
a comprehensive analysis.
