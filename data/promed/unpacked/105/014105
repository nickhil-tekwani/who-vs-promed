This message is to deliberately expand the focus put so far on
epidemiological figures documenting the extent of the cholera in Pohnpei,
towards the energic containment measures that are currently implemented in
the field, by our colleagues from Pohnpei and FSM Health services. We (the
moderators), in fact, just would like to share with PACNET, what we like to
remind ourselves in the light of current and past experiences, i.e.: any
epidemic should never be considered out of context. Obviously, the
implementation of control measures form an important dimension of that
whole context.
You will find, summarised below, the public health measures actually
carried out by Pohnpei State to control the cholera outbreak. Most of these
were mentioned in the previous PACNET messages related to the outbreak.
They have been put in place before the visit of the PPHSN team (see Note).
All these measures and their relevance, were re-discussed with the PPHSN
team and some should have now been amended or intensified (especially
active case-finding and water chlorination), and some new ones added. This
will be the subject of a further message.
A household case-control study prepared with the PPHSN team is being
carried out by Pohnpei Health Services together with the Federal level and
the Red Cross. The focus of the study is more on the impact of health
education. During the visit of the PPHSN team, the states of Chuuk, Yap and
Kosrae were contacted and official communications were sent by the Federal
Health authorities, regarding cholera preparedness.
On the utmostly important matters of regional prevention and preparedness,
we would like to re-emphasise on the very sensitive problem-- also of
doubtful public health efficiency-- of trade restrictions between states,
territories and countries of the region. With all due respect, we'd like to
encourage all Health officials and relevant authorities to carefully take
decisions with reference to the WHO Guidelines for cholera control, and
after consulting with their counterparts in the Federated States of
Micronesia. YS
SUMMARY OF CONTROL MEASURES IN POHNPEI STATE
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Since the beginning of the outbreak, important control efforts are being
carried out by Pohnpei state, and information on the epidemic was made
public and was circulated on PACNET in order to encourage appropriate
surveillance and preparedness in the region. As well, under the umbrella of
the Pacific Public Health Surveillance Network, WHO and SPC are
collaborating with state and national authorities in order to better
contain the outbreak.
The control measures put in place are:
· Social gatherings with food are banned, and schools were closed.
· Sakau bars are closed except those complying with official regulations.
· Communities leaders were contacted and their assistance requested for
helping implementing control measures.
· Health education to the population.
· Community meetings were launched and are held in the evenings providing
information to the local population.
. Public Health teams consisting of medical staff, with the assistance of
Environmental Protection Agency, started to conduct follow-up visits to the
homes.
. Distribution of printed health education materials on water disinfection
and safe disposal of feces.
. The Red Cross has also launched a house-to-house education campaign (on
request) and provide Clorox bleach for water disinfection to homes unable
to afford the cost of bleach.
. Radio and television programs on cholera are broadcast several times a day.
· Public Health teams also carry out active case-finding in the households
of all admitted patients and provide selective chemoprophylaxis of
households with suspected cases of cholera.
· Hospital established a separated ward for cholera patients and limit
family access to one attendant, with strict hygiene and sanitation measures.
· Appropriate supplies of IV Ringer were ordered.
· Incoming and outgoing passengers at the Pohnpei Airport receive a
brochure informing them of the outbreak and precautions to take.
· Construction of water sealed latrines started in the most heavily
infected areas and the Government committed itself in providing the
latrines to all household without this kind of facility.
· Travels to the outer islands were curtailed.

(Note: the PPHSN outbreak investigation team was formed upon request of the
Pohnpei State Governor and FSM Governement--to WHO and SPC. This team of 5
was composed of Dr. Tom Kiedrzynski (SPC), Mr Martyn Kirk (WHO-STC), Dr.
Eliaser Johnson (Pohnpei State), Dr. Iris Wainiqolo (Fiji School of
Medicine) and Mr Amato Elymore (FSM Dpt. of Health). Prior to the arrival
of the external members of the PPHSN investigation team, the World Health
Organization had sent a laboratory specialist (STC) to train laboratory
technicians of all 4 FSM states in cholera diagnostic activities. Pohnpei
central laboratory now extended v. cholera diagnosis from mere isolation to
additional serotyping capability -- TK/YS)

[The summary comments of Dr. Souares rightfully highlight the doubtful
public health efficacy of trade restrictions between states, territories
and countries of the region in controlling a cholera outbreak/epidemic.
Remembering the early stages of the cholera epidemic in Peru in 1991 when
there was a virtual embargo of agricultural and fisheries products coming
from Peru, the only thing accomplished by the embargo was significant
economic damage to Peru (estimated at approximately US $400 million in the
first two months). Cholera transmission was not impacted, and did occur
throughout South America.
Dr. Souares also encourages all Health officials and relevant authorities
to carefully take decisions with reference to the WHO Guidelines for
cholera control. One assumes this includes a reference to the noticeable
absence of mention of supply and distribution of ORS (Oral rehydration
salts) the most cost effective management for the majority of cholera cases
if started early in the course of the illness. There is also a noticeable
absence of messages directed at educating the public to seek appropriate
treatment (ORS) as soon as symptoms begin. As mentioned in the ProMED
posting on Cholera in Oceania - background -- 1596 cases of cholera have
been reported from Pohnpei State during the period Jan to June 2000. As yet
there have not been cases reported from other States in the Federated
States of Micronesia this year, or from other island groups in the Oceania
region other than Guam. We await further news from our colleagues in the
region. - Mod.MPP
