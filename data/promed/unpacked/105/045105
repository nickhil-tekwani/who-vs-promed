Production system: closed
Affected population: the population is reared in a closed system. No clinical signs have been seen.
Total animals affected:
Of 50 000 susceptible crayfish (_Procambarus alleni_) the number of cases has not been calculated because of missing information. Ther have been no deaths, none hve been destroyed or slaughtered.

Epidemiology

[The aetiological agent of crayfish plague is _Aphanomyces astaci_. _A. astaci_ is a member of a group of organisms commonly known as the water moulds. Although long regarded as fungi, this group, the Oomycetida, are now considered protists and are classified with diatoms and brown algae in a group called the Stramenopiles or Chromista.

The 1st reports of large crayfish mortalities go back to 1860 in Italy. These were followed by further reports of crayfish mortalities, where no other aquatic species were affected, in the Franco-German border region in the 3rd quarter of the 19th century. From there a steady spread of infection occurred, principally in 2 directions: down the Danube into the Balkans and towards the Black Sea, and across the North German plain into Russia and from there south to the Black Sea and north west to Finland and, in 1907, to Sweden. In the 1960s, the 1st outbreaks in Spain were reported, and in the 1980s further extensions of infection to the British Isles, Turkey, Greece and Norway followed. The reservoir of the original infections in the 19th century was never established; _Orconectes_ spp. were not known to have been introduced until the 1890s, but the post-1960s extensions are largely linked to movements of North American crayfish introduced more recently for purposes of crayfish farming. Escapes of such introduced species were almost impossible to prevent, and _Pacifastacus leniusculus_ and _Procambarus clarkii_ are now widely naturalised in many parts of Europe.

To date, all species of freshwater crayfish have to be considered as susceptible to infection with _Aphanomyces astaci_.

The target tissue that becomes initially infected is the exoskeleton cuticle. Soft cuticle, as is found on the ventral abdomen and around joints, is preferentially affected. In the highly susceptible European crayfish species, the pathogen often manages to penetrate the basal lamina located underneath the epidermis cell layer. From there, _A. astaci_ spreads throughout the body primarily by invading connective tissue and haemal sinuses; however, all tissues may be affected.

For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods, and references, please refer to the OIE Aquatic Manual 2013, Chapter 2.2.1, Crayfish plague (_Aphanomyces astaci_), at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/aahm/current/2.2.01_CRAYFISH_PLAGUE.pdf.

Infected animals may show clinical signs; however, infection may be present in the absence of any signs. Pictures of lesions of crayfish plague can be seen at http://library.enaca.org/Health/FieldGuide/html/cp001cra.htm. - Mod.CRD
