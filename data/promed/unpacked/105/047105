So far 63 cases of BSE have been detected in Spain during 2001.
Until 30 Jun 2001 it was possible to destroy older animals without
analysis. Since that day, and against all expectation, the number of
cases has not increased.
Meat on the bone has been used as animal feed until 2000. This and the
British experience suggests that an increase in the incidence of BSE in
cattle [would be expected.
In the European Union there is a compulsory selective slaughter of the
cohort of animals of the same age (plus/minus one year) of the affected
animal. The slaughter of the entire herd when a positive case is
detected is a voluntary measure to be taken by the farmers. The
Laboratorio Central de Referencia has analyzed 700 animals from herds
where a previous positive had been confirmed and found 4 positives,
all of them belonging to the same age cohort.
Month / No of cases analysed / No of positives
January / 10 268 / 10
February / 24 772 / 20
March / 21 708 / 6
April / 19 523 / 6
May / 28 287 / 2
June / 22 056 / 2
July / 30 304 / 6
August / 32 409 / 6
September (first 2 weeks) / 22 752 / 5
