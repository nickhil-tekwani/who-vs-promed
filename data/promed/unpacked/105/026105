A media news article reported that the wali (governor) of (the state/wilaya of) Chlef, Lakhdar Sadas, said the accident in which 149 citizens were poisoned on [Tenes] Beach was due to (a leaked) gas, emitted from one of the ships, hitting their respiratory systems.

In a statement to Al-Shorouk News channel, the state's governor confirmed the issue was related to a gas hitting the respiratory system, noting that suspicions were hovering around a ship carrying cattle docked in the port of Chlef.

The same spokesman explained that Public Prosecution was notified of the incident, and the competent authorities began their investigations and sent samples to the capital's laboratories to conduct the necessary analysis; the result is pending. [We are not told what samples were collected or what tests were requested. - Mod.TG]

For reference, the details of the incident date back to Sunday (4 Jul 2021) evening, when 149 citizens who were on [Tenes] Beach were poisoned. Those concerned suffered from nausea, fever, and redness in the eyes, so they were transferred to the Martyr Zigoud Youssef Hospital in [Tenes].

Among the affected are 28 divers and 7 civil protection agents, and the governor confirmed about 50 injured people had left the hospital.

As a precaution, the state's authorities ordered the closure of the 3 beaches [near Tenes], as well as the sea desalination plant in Mainis.

Around 200 people fell ill after [swimming in the ocean] in northwestern Algeria on Sunday [4 Jul 2021] and were admitted to hospital after a possible poisoning from the sea, local and medical officials said.

Three beaches were closed, as was a desalination plant in the area, and prosecutors in the state of [Chlef] opened an investigation into the location of [Tenes].

The governor of [Chlef] told Lakhdar that the victims were suffering from bacterial [?], fever, and red eyes, and all had been discharged from the hospital.

[Chlef's] prevention officer at the Directorate of Health and Population, Nasser El-Din Ben Cartelia, was of the opinion that "victims floating on the central beach of [Tenes] had narrowed [?] the gas, which spread quickly. The wind that blew throughout the afternoon on Sunday [4 Jul 2021]"... [the remainder of the section was not clearly translated so it was removed. - Mod.JH]

Al-Wali said, "We do not rule out any hypothesis, but at present, the possible hypothesis relates to the leakage of a ship carrying animal food into the sea of [Tenes]."

A news website reported that a cargo ship named "Barhoom 2" had sailed from the port of Sete in southern France.

Another hypothesis is that toxic microscopic algae spread in the water, according to Reda Dejeber, a professor in the Faculty of Biological Sciences at the University of Bab Izjuvar in Algiers.

A team of divers was dispatched to search for harmful pollutants, and 36 members of the divers fell ill, including professional divers from the Civil Defense.

An official statement said a delegation from the Ministry of Environment took air and water samples at [Tenes] ports, beaches, valleys near beaches, and facilities that cause pollution.

The victims of gas poisoning, evacuated on Sunday [4 Jul 2021] evening to Ziroud Youcef hospital in Tenes (Chlef province), have all left the health establishment after receiving necessary care, an official at the local Directorate of Health and Population (DHP) said Monday [5 Jul 2021].

"Out of the 193 people admitted to the hospital of Tenes on Sunday [4 Jul 2021] evening, 7 spent the night there and left the hospital on Monday [5 Jul 2021] at 7 a.m. after receiving necessary care," stated the head of prevention at the same department, Dr Nasreddine Benkartalia.

He reported that the people admitted to the hospital of Tenes presented various symptoms such as fever, nausea, vomiting, redness in eyes, and allergy, noting doctors and paramedical staff stood by their bedside until the early morning.

Speaking on the regional radio of Chlef, the wali (governor), Lakhdar [Sadas], confirmed that no victim of the poisoning is currently in the hospital of Tenes, mentioning the setting up of a commission of enquiry in order to know the "ins and outs" of this case.

"Services from various security bodies went to the central beach of Tenes yesterday [4 Jul 2021] evening in order to carry out the usual analyses, necessary in such circumstances, which require high technology," he said.

On the same occasion, the province mayor announced the Ministry of the Environment had sent a specialized commission to analyze the waters of the river located next to the beach.

"No hypothesis will be neglected, but, obviously, the most plausible one (it comes back with insistence) is the one related to the dumping of a boat off Tenes of animals' food," he [stated], mentioning the opening of an investigation on this issue by the prosecutor's office of Chlef.

[This poisoning is a little hard to understand, as the earliest report mentions it may have come from a cattle ship. While it is possible the ship offloaded some manure into the water, these articles indicate that the victims all had red eyes, fever, nausea, and vomiting.

If the ship did unload manure, it may have set up a situation for toxic algae to proliferate. Toxic algae in airborne seafoam or spray can cause skin issues, red eyes, and nausea and occasionally vomiting, depending upon the species of algae and its toxin. Fever has been reported in some individuals from toxic algae.

It is not possible to definitively say if the illnesses were caused by a toxic algae bloom, brought on by something perhaps dumped from the ship. Appropriate temperature and conditions can cause algae blooms, and these algal blooms and spray on water surface could indeed cause such reactions.

We await the results of the investigation. - Mod.TG
