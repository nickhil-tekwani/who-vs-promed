About 30 birds have died in Ravanga locality in South District in the
past 2 days due to unnatural causes, triggering fear about a possible
outbreak of bird flu in the Himalayan state.

Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Services Department Director K.C.
Bhutia confirmed the deaths of over 2 dozen birds, including
chickens, due to unnatural causes in Ravangla area in the past 2 days
but refused to confirm the outbreak of bird flu in Sikkim.

The department was closely monitoring the unnatural mortality of
birds, he told PTI here and added that a report from the central
health authorities was being awaited to confirm whether these birds
have died due to bird flu or to other reasons. Sikkim had banned
supply of poultry products from outside the state last month
[December 2008] following the outbreak of bird flu in Malda district
of West Bengal. The state police had been conducting searches in
vehicles at Rangpo and other check posts bordering Sikkim to prevent
importation of poultry products from outside.

There has been an outbreak of bird flu in the Ravangla area of
Sikkim's south district, Minister for Food, Civil Supplies and Animal
Husbandry K. Subba, told The Hindu over telephone on Monday [19 Jan 2009].

"Samples of 33 dead poultry birds had been sent to the High Security
Disease Laboratory in Bhopal for tests. That the deaths were caused
by bird flu was officially confirmed on Sunday [18 Jan 2009]," Ms. Subba said.

Steps are being taken for the culling of birds in the affected
region. "There is a proposal for destroying about 20 000 birds, but
since there is no report of the disease spreading, we will determine
the final numbers to be culled after 2 or 3 days," she added.

Steps are also being taken to prevent the supply of poultry products
from the Ravangla area to other parts of the state. "We have already
banned all imports of poultry birds from other states since bird flu
was reported in Assam more than a month ago," Ms. Subba said.
