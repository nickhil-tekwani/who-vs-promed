Taiwan on Thursday, 27 Aug 2015, reported its 1st case of brucellosis since 2011, saying that the patient, a 35-year-old caregiver from Indonesia, is believed to have contracted the bacterial disease abroad.

The woman was hospitalized on 3 Aug 2015 after she developed a fever and backache, and was diagnosed with brucellosis, a bacterial infection usually transmitted from animals to people, most often via unpasteurized dairy products, according to Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control (CDC). None of the people whom the woman came in contact have shown signs of the disease, the CDC said.

CDC Deputy Director Chuang Jen-hsiang said it is believed to be an imported case since the chances of contracting the disease in Taiwan are very low. Taiwan last reported brucellosis in 2011, when 5 imported cases from Africa, Southeast Asia and China were recorded. The CDC has warned that travelers to those areas should avoid drinking unpasteurized milk, eating uncooked meat or coming into close contact with animals.

[The back pain in the woman can be nonspecific or be related to brucellosis of the spine. It is not stated in the report how the diagnosis was made, by culture or by serology. It is not clear where the infection was acquired.

Brucellosis is a common zoonotic disease throughout Africa, Asia, the Middle East, Mediterranean Basin, Eastern Europe, the Caribbean, Central America and South America. Brucellae are small, slow-growing Gram-negative coccobacilli that typically infect livestock (goats, sheep, cattle, swine). Most exposures occur in countries where brucellosis is endemic, with consumption of unpasteurized milk or milk products being the most common risk factor. Less commonly, brucellae are inhaled in farm settings or inoculated into cuts and other skin breaks after direct contact with blood or body fluids when an infected animal is slaughtered (e.g., feral pig). The primary human pathogens are _B. melitensis_, _B. abortus_ and _B. suis_. After an incubation period that ranges from weeks to months, predominant symptoms are fever (intermittent and/or undulating), profuse sweating (often described as malodorous), fatigue, headache, weight loss and arthralgia. Cytopenias [low blood cell counts], hepatitis, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly and splenomegaly are common. Combination antimicrobial therapy for weeks to months is required, and infection is prone to relapse. - Mod.LL
