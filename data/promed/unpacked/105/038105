Thailand. 27 Feb 2019. (published) The authors assessed the long-term circulation of Zika virus in Thailand. In this observational study, they analysed data from individuals with suspected Zika virus infection who presented at hospitals throughout the country and had biological samples (serum, plasma, or urine) tested for confirmation with PCR at the National Institute of Health laboratories in Bangkok. Of the 3089 samples from 1717 symptomatic individuals tested between January 2016 and December 2017, a total of 368 were confirmed to have Zika virus infection. Cases of Zika virus infection were reported throughout the year and from 29 of the 76 Thai provinces. Phylogenetic reconstructions suggest persistent circulation within Thailand since at least 2002. This evidence shows that Zika virus has circulated at a low but sustained level for at least 16 years, suggesting that Zika virus can adapt to persistent endemic transmission.

[2] _Culex quinquefasciatus_ infection
Date: Thu 26 Apr 2018

ref: Smartt CT, Shin D, Kang S, Tabachnick WJ. _Culex quinquefasciatus_ (Diptera: Culicidae) from Florida transmitted Zika virus. Front Microbiol. 2018; 9:768. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2018.00768. eCollection 2018.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
We report a laboratory colony of _Culex quinquefasciatus_ mosquitoes were experimentally able to salivate Zika virus (ZIKV, Flaviviridae; Flavivirus) at 16 days post-infection (dpi). ZIKV RNA was detected in bodies and in saliva deposited on filter paper cards with subsequent studies demonstrating the presence of live ZIKV in saliva.

Discussion
Detection of ZIKV RNA in laboratory-infected _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ is not novel; however, this report is the 1st laboratory study to show positive plaque assay results of live ZIKV collected from saliva from colonized _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. The results are proof of ZIKV transmission by this _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ population under the conditions of the study.

Caution is needed when making conclusions about the contribution of this mosquito species to future ZIKV cases until the competence for ZIKV by recently collected field populations of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ from the same region is evaluated under varying environmental conditions. These findings support that there exists population-specific variability in the vector competence of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ for ZIKV like other mosquito-arboviral systems (Tabachnick, 2013). It affirms that there are biological and environmental conditions in which _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ mosquitoes are likely competent for ZIKV, and these mosquitoes may play a role in ZIKV transmission to humans. Varying yet unknown environmental conditions likely influence variation in vector competence that has been reported in different studies that have resulted in different conclusions about the role of _Culex_ in ZIKV transmission. We urge caution in making sweeping generalizations of ZIKV transmission capability. For example, further studies are warranted to ascertain those conditions that influence _Culex_ vector competence for ZIKV in different localities where _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ could be important in ZIKV epidemiology.

[The caution that the authors indicated is warranted in order to determine the role of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ as a ZIKV vector in nature. Results from previous laboratory studies by other groups have yielded conflicting results, some indicating that this species is a competent vector and other that it is refractory to infection. The positive results of the above studies indicate that vector competence for ZIKV in different field populations of _Culex_ is important to assess in order to carry out effective field surveillance and plan control strategies. - Mod.TY]

Development and Validation of Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) for Rapid Detection of ZIKV in Mosquito Samples from Brazil.

The rapid spread of Zika virus (ZIKV) represents a global public health problem, especially in areas that harbor several mosquito species responsible for virus transmission, such as Brazil. In these areas, improvement in mosquito control needs to be a top priority, but mosquito viral surveillance occurs inefficiently in ZIKV-endemic countries. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is the gold standard for molecular diagnostic of ZIKV in both human and mosquito samples. However, the technique presents high cost and limitations for point-of-care (POC) diagnostics, which hampers its application for a large number of samples in entomological surveillance programs. Here, we developed and validated a one-step reverse transcription LAMP (RT-LAMP) platform for detection of ZIKV in mosquito samples. The RT-LAMP assay was highly specific for ZIKV and up to 10 000 times more sensitive than qRT-PCR. Assay validation was performed using 60 samples from _Aedes aegypti_ and _Culex quinquefasciatus_ mosquitoes collected in Pernambuco State, Brazil, which is at the epicenter of the Zika epidemic. The RT-LAMP had a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 91.18%, and overall accuracy of 95.24%. Thus, our POC diagnostics is a powerful and inexpensive tool to monitor ZIKV in mosquito populations and will allow developing countries to establish better control strategies for this devastating pathogen.

[This technique is a major advance in Zika virus detection and will be useful both for mosquito surveillance and for point-of-care diagnosis of human cases, especially for pregnant women. Its ease of use, accuracy that permits differentiation of Zika, dengue and chikungunya virus infections, and low cost should lead to its adoption throughout areas where Zika virus is transmitted. - Mod.TY]

[4] Travel advisory

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) issued a new Zika risk assessment saying that "while transmission has slowed in the Americas, the Zika virus is widespread in Asia."

This new ECDC report published on 20 Mar 2019, says "the risk of Zika infection depends on the local risk of mosquito-borne transmission." And, the Zika virus remains a leading concern for pregnant women, the risk related to sexual transmission of Zika, and the risk of importation into European countries.

During 2019, the ECDC has confirmed 3 travel-associated Zika cases in Denmark and Norway in travelers returning from Thailand.

The updated World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines say "Pregnant women and their partners, and couples planning a pregnancy should be aware of their Zika virus risks prior to traveling abroad." According to the new WHO guidelines for the prevention of sexual transmission of Zika, the duration for consistent use of condoms or abstinence from sex with an infected partner is reduced: from 6 to 3 months for men and to 2 months for women.

Additionally, the ECDC says "clinicians should remain alert to the risk of Zika infection in travelers returning from areas with ongoing or past Zika transmission. And, depending on each country's national guidelines, clinicians may consider testing for a Zika infection of those with compatible symptoms." This is an important recommendation because a Zika infection during pregnancy can result in severe fetal brain defects and microcephaly.

This ECDC report is in contrast with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which updated its Zika recommendations on 5 Apr 2019, saying "pregnant women and couples planning a pregnancy within the next 3 months, consult with a healthcare provider in making international travel decisions."

[Although the travel advice from ECDC and WHO vary somewhat from the CDC advice, the important point is that, although the incidence of Zika virus infection is less in the Americas so far this year (2019), the risk has not declined to zero.

The situation in Asia is more active, depending on the country. In December 2018, the US CDC issued a travel health notice due to Zika virus transmission in India in Rajasthan and its surrounding states. The advisory further cautioned pregnant women not to travel to areas with ongoing Zika outbreaks. Women planning pregnancy were also alerted for travel. Such an advisory could have had serious implications on travel and trade in India. Subsequently, the CDC withdrew its travel alert/advisory against pregnant women coming to India. This follows a stern rebuttal from the government of India about the CDC classification of the disease being endemic in India. Between September and November 2018, India had outbreaks of Zika virus disease in Jaipur as well as Bhopal and its neighboring districts in Madhya Pradesh. There were 153 cases. No new cases of Zika virus disease have been reported from both states since the end of November 2018 (reported in https://medibulletin.com/after-govt-of-india-rebuttal-cdc-withdraws-zika-travel-alert/).

Given that about 80% of Zika virus infections are asymptomatic or very mild, they may not be recognized in routine surveillance efforts and yet be present, probably at very low levels. Travelers need to be aware of the risk of Zika virus infection in the localities they intend to visit, and even though that risk may not be not great, should be aware of the consequences of infection while pregnant and understand the measures that can be taken to reduce that risk. - Mod.TY]

Devon C. Pawley, Michael J. Ricciardi, Emre Dikici, Sapna K. Deo, and Sylvia Daunert. Highly Sensitive and Selective Direct Detection of Zika Virus Particles in Human Bodily Fluids for Accurate Early Diagnosis of Infection.

Abstract
Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arbovirus that caused widespread panic beginning in 2015 in northeastern Brazil due to the threatening link between infection and fetal abnormalities such as microcephaly, spontaneous abortions, and stillbirths. Since the epidemic began, the virus has been further investigated, unveiling that the long-term dangers of ZIKV infection go beyond fetal neurological impairment. Characterization of the active infection has proven difficult because only 20% of infected individuals are symptomatic. Additionally, ZIKV is often misdiagnosed due to serological cross-reactivity with similar flaviviruses such as dengue, yellow fever, and West Nile. To date, there is no approved vaccine or therapy against ZIKV, highlighting the urgent need to accurately identify active infection to help minimize the spread of the virus. Herein, we developed an immunosorbent assay to detect early active ZIKV using neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies isolated from infected patients in Brazil that do not cross-react with dengue viruses 1-4 and bind directly to a ZIKV immunodominant epitope. The calculated limits of detection of active ZIKV fall within the physiological ranges of the virus in human bodily fluids. This selective immunoassay creates the platform required for future translation toward a point-of-care assay for ZIKV, a necessity to diagnose active ZIKV in the remote regions of which it thrives.

Conclusions
In this work, we have described an ELISA for the acute phase detection of ZIKV with very high specificity. Our assay has been validated in different bodily fluids such as urine, saliva, serum, and whole blood. Because the collection of urine and saliva is noninvasive and nongender-specific, and urine showed no matrix effect, urine is selected as the preferred sample matrix for this immunoassay. Our assay is very specific and can distinguish the ZIKV infection from DENV infection in 100% of the spiked sample experiments performed. The assay is ready for a large-scale validation using real patient samples collected in dengue-endemic regions if available. The specificity, accuracy, and the precision of our assay are high and provide the healthcare provider an answer within 6 h of urine collection, demonstrating the 1st immunoassay-detecting active ZIKV directly in human urine without the need for sample preparation or subsequent purification. The development of this assay represents a vital milestone, as the current translation of this immunoassay to a point-of-care device by our group is under optimization to provide global access to ZIKV testing and thus help regulate its spread.

[Assuming that the monoclonal antibodies used in this test will become readily available in the tropical countries where Zika virus transmission occurs, and at reasonable cost, this technique would be of particular value for screening pregnant women to determine whether they are infected with Zika virus. This would permit their being more closely monitored during their pregnancies and as well as any adverse effects of the developing fetuses. - Mod.TY]
