One person has died of suspected anthrax while 82 others have so far
received treatment following an outbreak of the disease in Zimbabwe's
province of Mashonaland West, The Sunday Mail reported [map at
<http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/zimbabwe.pdf>].
The provincial medical director Winceslas Nyamayaro confirmed the disease
outbreak but said the cause of the one recorded death had not yet been
ascertained.
Last week 82 cases involving people and 2 cases involving cattle were
detected on Ngwarati and Mahewu farms in Trelawney. Anthrax is an acute,
contagious disease characterized by septicaemia and sudden death.
The disease is caused by the bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_ whose unique
feature is its ability to form dormant stages (spores) which can survive in
the soil for many years.
Animals become infected by ingestion of contaminated feed or water. In the
body, the spores multiply and produce a lethal toxin which kills the
animal. Crispen Devere, who is the acting provincial environmental health
officer, said his office had managed to contain the situation.
"It is the first time we have had an outbreak on those 2 farms but I wish
to inform all concerned parties that we have managed to successfully treat
all cases at Ngwarati and Mahewu farms," Devere said.
