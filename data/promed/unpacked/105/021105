ProMED has been a leader in the field of innovative disease surveillance strategies to complement routine disease surveillance using non-traditional information sources to serve as an early warning for emerging and reemerging diseases. Our structure includes a cadre of expert moderators who find reports on events of interest and prepare reports with expert commentaries on these events to post to our website and social media channels as well as send via email to our 80 000 subscribers.

To enhance information within our African regional networks, we are looking for moderators based in Cote d'Ivoire, Nigeria, and Rwanda to work with us.

The individual will join an international team of global health specialists reporting disease trends via innovative surveillance techniques. This individual must be a national and resident of Cote d'Ivoire, Nigeria, or Rwanda and will have a focus on health events in the African region for the ProMED African networks.
