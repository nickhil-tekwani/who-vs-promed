About 13 per cent of influenza cases in children at a hospital in Spain were attributable to influenza C virus infection, and these patients had similar clinical courses to other pediatric flu cases, according to a prospective study in The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal [Calvo C et al: Prospective Study of Influenza C in Hospitalized Children, Pediatr Infect Dis J 2013; doi: 10.1097/INF.0b013e31828fca10; http://journals.lww.com/pidj/Abstract/publishahead/Prospective_Study_of_Influenza_C_in_Hospitalized.98336.aspx.]

These researchers tested all children younger than 14 years who were hospitalised for a respiratory tract infection from September 2005 through July 2012. Influenza was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction in 128 patients during this time (6.2 per cent of all confirmed viral infections). Of those, 89 (69.5 per cent) had influenza A, 21 (16.4 per cent) had influenza B, and 17 (13.3 per cent) had influenza C. All but 4 of the influenza C patients had a co-infection with up to 3 viruses (such as adenovirus, bocavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, or rhinovirus). Aside from this distinction, the flu C patients had similar clinical profiles to those of the other flu patients.

[Seasonal influenza is an acute viral infection caused by influenza viruses. There are 3 types of seasonal influenza -- A, B, and C. Type A influenza viruses are further typed into subtypes according to different kinds and combinations of virus surface proteins. Among many subtypes of influenza A viruses, currently influenza A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) subtypes are circulating among humans, and more recently the avian H5N1 and H7N9 influenza viruses.

Type C influenza cases occur much less frequently than types A and B. It is likely that most of the population experiences influenza C virus infection in infancy, and although antigenic variation does occur there are no distinct haemagglutinin subtypes comparable to those among the A type influenza viruses. Pigs may serve as an animal reservoir of the type C viruses.

The report above confirms that influenza C virus infection is generally mild and one of the several viruses associated with respiratory infection in infancy. - Mod.CP
