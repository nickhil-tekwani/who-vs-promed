The National Health Foundation of Brazil (Funasa) recommends Yellow
Fever (YF) vaccination for people intending to spend the year-end
holidays in the interior of the states of Santa Catarina and Rio
Grande do Sul. This is an extension of the standing recommendations
for YF vaccination for visitors to the Central-West, North, Northeast
states, where the disease is endemic.
In October 2002, in the municipality of Rio Quente (Goias state), a
sick monkey was spotted that died a few days later. In November
2002, according to Funasa, a howler monkey [_Alouatta_ sp.] captured
in the municipality of Jaguari, in northeastern Rio Grande do Sul,
was found to be sick.
Funasa advises that the death of monkeys could signify an outbreak of
jungle YF, increasing the risk of spread by mosquitoes to humans in
the area.
Funasa is adding the following states to the areas of risk: southwest
Piaui, west Bahia, Minas Gerais, Sao Paulo, Parana, Santa Catarina &
northeast Rio Grande do Sul.

and Tocantins) and the Central-West (Federal District, Goias, Mato

Another area that is considered to be at risk of yellow fever
includes territorial belts of 7 States: the southwest of Piaui and
the western region of Bahia, Minas Gerais, Sao Paulo, Paran, Santa
Catarina, and the Northeast of Rio Grande do Sul. Vaccination of all
travelers to any of the above areas is recommended and is free of
charge in the health posts. - Mod.MPP]
