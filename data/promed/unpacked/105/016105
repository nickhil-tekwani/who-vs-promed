Ghana: WHO official calls for surveillance on yellow fever
-----------------------------------------------
Dr. Harry Opata, Professional Officer, Disease Prevention and Control Unit
of the World Health Organization, on Fri 4 Mar 2005, cautioned that an
outbreak of yellow fever in the country could be devastating if
surveillance on the disease was not increased. Yellow fever, he said, was
more deadly than malaria, but, unfortunately, people only get vaccinated
against it when they are traveling.
The latest cases of yellow fever outbreak were recorded at Jirapa-Lambusi
in the Upper West Region in December [2004] and in Upper Denkyira District
in the Central Region last January [2005?]. Dr. Opata, who was speaking at
a forum to mark the 2nd Annual Scientific Forum organized by the Korle-Bu
Medical Laboratory Technology Students Association in Accra, called for
regular vaccination at least once every 10 years for frequent travelers and
for people living in forest areas.
The theme for the forum was: "The Role Of The Medical Laboratory Scientist
in Active Surveillance of Yellow Fever in Ghana." Dr. Opata urged
laboratory technicians to go the extra mile and look beyond what doctors
recommend in order to make the surveillance on diseases, especially yellow
fever, effective and to help in the promotion of life saving actions to
arrest such diseases.
Dr. Lawson Ahiadze, Head, National Surveillance Unit of the Ghana Health
Service, said yellow fever was caused by mosquitoes. Symptoms of the
disease include fever of 39 C followed by jaundice, dehydration and
vomiting. Dr. Ahiadze explained that yellow fever was an acute viral
infection and was not transmitted from person-to-person. An outbreak is
likely to occur in areas that had once recorded the disease. He said it was
very important for at least every district to report suspected cases of the
disease to enable the country to have an effective surveillance system. "If
this happens, an outbreak would not take us by surprise," he said. He
recommended routine immunization, mass catch-up campaigns, and [increased
awareness] by clinicians and other health workers to supervise and monitor
the disease.
