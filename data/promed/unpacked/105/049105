Two new reports on human cases of H5N1 avian influenza that occurred in
Turkey and Indonesia during 2005 show that the illness proved difficult to
diagnose, with many tests yielding false-negative results. A report on 8
cases in Turkey and a similar report on 8 Indonesian cases, published in the
Thu 23 Nov New England Journal of Medicine, says many of the patients tested
negative the first time around, even on polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
tests.
The Turkish report describes 8 of the 12 confirmed cases the country has had
so far, all of which occurred in late December 2005 and January 2006. All 8
patients -- 4 of whom survive -- were treated at a hospital in Van in
eastern Turkey. The patients included sets of 3 and 2 siblings, and 7 lived
in the same community.
The hospital tested a total of 290 patients for avian flu during the
outbreak, using a rapid influenza test, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA), and real-time PCR. All the rapid and ELISA test results were
negative, the report says. Four of the 8 case-patients initially had
negative results on all 3 tests, using nasopharyngeal specimens. Because the
patients were severely ill, the tests were repeated using tracheal aspirate
specimens, and the real-time PCR tests then were positive. Tests of
nasopharyngeal specimens established the diagnosis in the other 4 patients.
"Before H5N1 infection was diagnosed in the 8 patients, a total of 8
real-time PCR tests, 12 rapid influenza tests, and 12 ELISA tests were
negative," the article states.
The Indonesian report covers 3 family clusters of H5N1 cases that occurred
between June and October of 2005 and included the country's first cases. The
clusters consisted of 3 cases in Tangerang, Java; 2 cases in Bintaro, Java;
and 3 in Lampung, Sumatra. Four of the 8 patients died. All rapid tests on
the patients were negative, and many reverse-transcriptase PCR tests were
negative, particularly with nasal specimens, according to the report. Throat
swabs were more likely to test positive on RT-PCR than nasal swabs were.
The Turkish authors write, "Because of the difficulties in detecting H5N1
infection, repeated testing from nasopharyngeal swabs or deep
tracheal-aspiration samples in patients who are strongly suspected of having
H5N1 infection should be performed even if tests of initial nasophyaryngeal
swabs are negative."
In other findings, the Indonesian report says that the source of infection
for the first patient in 2 of the clusters was never identified. The 3
patients in the first cluster reported no contact with birds, other animals,
or sick people other than family members before they fell ill. In the 2nd
cluster, patients reported no contact with birds, other animals, or sick
people, but the index patient used fertilizer containing chicken droppings
that tested positive for H5N1.
The report says limited person-to-person transmission could not be ruled out
in the first 2 Indonesian clusters, since the patients had no other known
exposures to the virus. Three of the 4 Indonesian patients who recovered
were children (aged 4, 5, and 9) who had mild disease. This resembles the
pattern in Hong Kong's 1997 H5N1 outbreak, in which most children who were
infected had relatively mild disease, the article says.
The Indonesian authors write that the clusters in Indonesia and Turkey, as
well as others in Hong Kong, Viet Nam, Thailand, China, and Azerbaijan,
"raise questions as to whether genetic or other factors may predispose some
persons to H5N1 virus infection or to severe disease." They add that more
investigation is needed to understand "the role of mild cases in the
epidemiology of this disease and whether genetic, behavioral, immunologic,
and environmental factors may contribute to case clustering."

[The 2 papers referred to in the preceding CIDRAP News report shed some
light on the question of the extent of mild or sub-clinical infection of
humans by the avian H5N1 influenza virus, although the emphasis of the
CIDRAP report is concerned more with problems in diagnosis of the disease,
particularly in younger patients. The 2 papers appear in the 23 Nov 2006
issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. - Mod.CP.
1. Avian influenza A(H5N1) infection in eastern Turkey in 2006. Ahmet Faik
Oner, et al. N Engl J Med 2006; 355(21): 2179-85.
<http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/355/21/2179> The abstract
reads as follows:
"Background:
"An outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) that had
previously been detected throughout Asia, with major economic and health
repercussions, extended to eastern Turkey in late December 2005 and early
January 2006.
"Methods:
"We documented the epidemiologic, clinical, and radiologic features of all
cases of confirmed H5N1 virus infection in patients who were admitted to
Yuzuncu Yil University Hospital in Van, Turkey, between 31 Dec 2005, and 10
Jan, 2006.
"Results:
"H5N1 virus infection was diagnosed in 8 patients. The patients were 5 to 15
years of age, and all 8 had a history of close contact with diseased or dead
chickens. The mean (plus or minus SD) time between exposure and the onset of
illness was 5.0 plus or minus 1.3 days. All the patients had fever, and 7
had clinical and radiologic evidence of pneumonia at presentation; 4
patients died. Results of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and rapid
influenza tests were negative in all patients, and the diagnosis was made by
means of a polymerase-chain-reaction assay.
"Conclusions:
"H5N1, which causes a spectrum of illnesses in humans, including severe and
fatal respiratory disease, can be difficult to diagnose."
2. Three Indonesian clusters of H5N1 virus infection in 2005. I Nyoman
Kandun, et al. N Engl J Med 2006; 355(21): 2186-94.
<http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/355/21/2186> The abstract
reads as follows:
"Background:
"Since 2003, the widespread ongoing epizootic of avian influenza A (H5N1)
among poultry and birds has resulted in human H5N1 cases in 10 countries.
The first case of H5N1 virus infection in Indonesia was identified in July
2005.
"Methods:
"We investigated 3 clusters of Indonesian cases with at least 2 ill persons
hospitalized with laboratory evidence of H5N1 virus infection from June
through October 2005. Epidemiologic, clinical, and virologic data on these
patients were collected and analyzed.
"Results:
"Severe disease occurred among all 3 clusters, including deaths in 2
clusters. Mild illness in children was documented in 2 clusters. The median
age of the 8 patients was 8.5 years (range, 1 to 38). Four patients required
mechanical ventilation, and 4 of the 8 patients (50 per cent) died. In each
cluster, patients with H5N1 virus infection were members of the same family,
and most lived in the same home. In 2 clusters, the source of H5N1 virus
infection in the index patient was not determined. Virus isolates were
available for one patient in each of 2 clusters, and molecular sequence
analyses determined that the isolates were clade 2 H5N1 viruses of avian
origin.
"Conclusions:
"In 2005 in Indonesia, clusters of human infection with clade 2 H5N1 viruses
included mild, severe, and fatal cases among family members." - Mod.CP]
