Fireblight disease strikes Fingal
----------------------------------
A local authority is on high alert in order to prevent the spread of
a potentially catastrophic plant disease. Fingal County Council's
parks department have confirmed that the disease, known as
'Fireblight', was found on 2 street trees (whitebeams) on Seagrange
Avenue, Baldoyle, in May [2007]. The trees were removed and destroyed
under the department's supervision. In July [2007], 4 more whitebeam
trees were found with the disease on Verbena Avenue, Bayside, and
these have also been removed. Then, 2 weeks ago, a further 16 trees
were identified with the infection at Bayside Boulevard North, Alden
Grove, Bayside Boulevard and Verbena Grove.
All of the trees with the infection will be removed in the next few
weeks and destroyed. It is intended to replace them with species
resistant to the disease. Residents will be notified when the trees
are being removed but there is no possibility of retaining trees
where the disease has been identified. Gerry Fitzgerald, senior
executive parks superintendent at Fingal County Council, told
Northside People that Fireblight was a serious disease of plants in
the rose family that includes hawthorn, rowan/mountain ash and
whitebeam [as well as being devastating for apple, pear and quince
trees].
"If the disease were to become established in Ireland, particularly
on hawthorn, it would be catastrophic," stated Mr. Fitzgerald. "The
disease is covered under plant hygiene regulations and the Department
of Agriculture must be notified if it is found. "Plants with the
disease must be removed immediately and destroyed by burying or
burning," added Mr. Fitzgerald.
A spokeswoman for the Department of Agriculture told Northside People
that the disease has been found sporadically across the North Dublin
area in the past. "On those occasions, infected and suspected plant
material was removed and planting of host species was reduced," she
said. "Recently there were indications that there were problems in
some stands of whitebeam trees in that area. Fingal County Council is
aware of the situation and is taking appropriate action as required
and, as with previous findings, is co-operating fully with this
department," the spokeswoman added.
Meanwhile, Councillor Peter Coyle (Labour) has called on the
Department of the Environment to act quickly on the matter. "The
extent of the problem needs to be established," said Councillor
Coyle. "The department must also provide information to the general
public, and introduce appropriate controls to prevent further
spreading of the disease in Fingal. "If Fireblight is on roadside
trees, it must also be in gardens and parks. "For example, is it now
on the Howth Peninsula or in St Anne's Park?" Councillor Coyle has
called on Minister for the Environment, John Gormley, to make a
statement on the matter.
A spokesman for the Department of Environment told Northside People
that unless Special Protection Areas are impacted on, the outbreak is
more of a matter for the Department of Agriculture.

[Although the disease is reported in ornamental and street trees,
these constitute pathogen reservoirs from where the pathogen may
spread posing a potentially very serious threat to all pome fruit
trees. Many varieties of pear and apple trees are susceptible
although some less than others. Only members of the _Rosaceae_
sub-family _Pomoideae_ are affected. The host range covers more than
180 species from 39 genera, including also quince, ornamental roses,
hawthorn, and firethorn.
Fireblight is caused by the bacterium _Erwinia amylovora_, the first
bacterium described as causal agent of a plant disease. Fireblight
was 1st reported from the state of New York (USA) and is now widely
distributed in northern America, Europe, small areas of western Asia,
and is endemic to New Zealand. In Ireland it has been reported as
being present in some areas only.
The disease derived its name from the symptoms of blackening of the
leaves as if they were scorched by fire. Affected shoots bend forming
black hooks, cankers appear on branches and trunks, and trees
invariably die. The bacteria are highly infectious and are spread by
insects (aphids, flies, bees etc), wind, water, and mechanical means
entering the host plant through wounds, often on flowers. The
pathogen can survive on the host as an endophyte or epiphyte for
variable periods of time depending of environmental factors, and it
is apparently quiescent through the dormant period of the host.
_E. amylovora_ has been placed on the list of pests recommended for
regulation as quarantine pests by the European Plant Protection
Organisation (EPPO). In Australia, the pome fruit industry is
fighting very hard to keep the pathogen out of the country and to
continue fruit import embargoes from countries with endemic
fireblight. The costs of fireblight to national agricultural
industries due to yield losses and disease management requirements
are potentially enormous. Fireblight is probably the most serious
disease affecting pear or apple cultivars in many countries.
