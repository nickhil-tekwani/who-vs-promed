[1] Germany: new statistics
Date: Wed 1 Jun 2011
Source: The Guardian, Associated Press (AP) report [edited]
http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/jun/01/ecoli-outbreak-more-sick-germany


The number of people reported sick in Germany from a foodborne
bacterial outbreak that has already killed 16 spiked over the last 24
hours, with nearly 100 more people suffering from severe and
potentially fatal symptoms, according to the national disease control
centre.

The agriculture minister, Ilse Aigner, said scientists were trying to
find the source of the unusual strain of the _E. coli_ bacteria, which
is believed to have been spread within Europe on tainted vegetables
and to discover where, in the chain from farm to grocery store, the
contamination occurred.

"Hundreds of tests have been done and the responsible agencies ...
have determined that most of the patients who have been sickened ate
cucumbers, tomatoes and leaf lettuce, primarily in northern Germany,"
Aigner said on ARD television. "The states that have conducted the
tests must now trace back the delivery path to see how the cucumbers,
or tomatoes, or lettuce got here."

German officials initially pointed to a few cucumbers from Spain, but
further tests showed that those vegetables, while contaminated, did
not cause the outbreak. Officials are still warning all Germans to
avoid eating raw cucumbers, tomatoes, or lettuce.

Germany's national health agency, the Robert Koch Institute, said 470
people are now suffering from the syndrome, in which an _E. coli_
toxin attacks the kidneys, sometimes causing seizures, strokes and
coma. That figure is up from 373 reported Tue 31 May 2011. Germany
typically sees a maximum of 50 to 60 HUS cases in a year.

Spanish cucumbers are not the source of the _E. coli_ O104 outbreak.
This has been released by Hamburg senator Cornelia Prufer-Storcks this
afternoon, 31 May 2011. A bacterium has been found, but not of the
type O104, which led to the outbreak of _E. coli_, which at the time
of publishing already has resulted in the death of 16 people.

Richard Soepenberg from Frunet Bio isn't surprised by this
afternoon's statement. "We always assumed it. Tests on our cucumbers
have always been negative." Frunet Bio is still not officially
indicted. "We have received a 2nd opinion, which was also negative and
thus positive for us. We never received documents to say we were the
source. I have always been convinced that the cucumbers had nothing to
do with us. Our customers are mainly in the French market, which is
good for 60 percent of our volume, and no one has become sick over
there. The cause of the source must be sought, in my opinion, in
Northern Germany."

Tuesday afternoon, 31 May 2011, it was also made known that the EHEC
[enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_] bacterium has not been found in Dutch
vegetables. This is according to results of a study commissioned by
the Productschap Tuinbouw. According to a spokesperson, several
samples were tested from Dutch cucumbers, tomatoes, lettuce and
peppers. The EHEC bacterium was not found.

[After the initial rush to Spanish-derived cucumbers, it is now
reported that the isolates found were not O104. ProMED-mail awaits
further information regarding the contamination vehicle, whether
cucumbers or another salad ingredient, or another food-stuff that is
either eaten uncooked, inadequately cooked, contaminated after cooking
by poor kitchen hygiene, or even deliberately contaminated. The quite
unusual nature of the isolate, including the serotype and the absence
of the eae gene, its unusual apparent virulence and its remarkable
antibiotic resistance could bring one to speculate upon the last. -

To date, 5 people in the Netherlands have been sickened with an
unusual strain of _E. coli_, the institute for public health (RIVM)
reported Wed 1 Jun 2011. Of the 5 patients, 4 also suffered from
intestinal problems and renal failure. The 5 who are infected all had
recently been in Germany.

The outbreak has hit at least 8 European countries but virtually all
of the sick people either live in Germany or recently traveled there.

Medical authorities appeared no closer to discovering either the
source of the infection or the mystery at the heart of the outbreak:
why the unusual strain of the _E. coli_ bacterium appears to be
causing so many cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome, which attacks the
kidneys and can cause seizures, strokes and coma.

"It is essential to quickly find the source, as long as it is not
found, the contamination can spread. It's a very aggressive bacterium
and many people are seriously ill," a RIVM spokesman said.

Czech health officials on Tue 31 May 2011, confirmed the country's
1st case of an _E. coli_ epidemic that has been radiating from Germany
over the last week.

The American tourist had just arrived in the Central European country
after a trip to northern Germany, where she had eaten vegetable
salads. She is being treated in the infectious disease ward of a
Prague hospital.

Federal health officials confirmed Tue 31 May 2011 that 2 USA
residents who recently traveled in northern Germany appear to be among
victims of a massive outbreak of food poisoning that has killed 16 and
sickened more than 1150 people in Europe since the 2nd week of May
2011 [week of 9 May 2011].

The victims have been hospitalized with serious, life-threatening
complications of _E. coli_ infections caused by a rare strain of the
bacterium that has taken scientists by surprise, said Dr Robert Tauxe,
deputy director of foodborne, bacterial, and mycotic diseases at the
CDC.

"We have never seen that organism before," Tauxe told msnbc.com. He's
referring to _E. coli_ O104:H4, a strain that can cause many of the
problems of the better-known _E. coli_ O157:H7, including bloody
diarrhea and the potentially deadly hemolytic uremic syndrome, or
HUS.

The American victims, who have not been identified by name, state, or
geography, were reported by state health officials who are monitoring
illness surveillance systems for signs that the outbreak has made its
way from Europe to America. Investigation of their cases is
continuing, Tauxe said.

State health agencies have been directed to report instances of HUS
or bloody diarrhea in recent travelers to Germany. Meantime, officials
with the FDA say they're flagging cucumbers, lettuce and tomatoes from
Spanish growers implicated in the outbreak for further inspection.
"Luckily, this is not a huge import season for vegetables," said
Siobhan DeLancey, an FDA spokeswoman.

Tauxe and other food safety experts said they would expect cases to
expand beyond Germany and 8 other European nations to the USA. "It's
hard for me to believe there won't be a handful of travelers who ate
contaminated food in a restaurant," said Dr Dennis Maki, an infectious
disease expert and professor emeritus at the University of Wisconsin
Department of Medicine. "I'll be surprised if we don't have a few
cases."

The rare germ, which is a type of bacterium known as Shiga-toxin
producing _E. coli_, or STEC, appears to be resistant to many commonly
used antibiotics, said Tauxe. However, doctors typically try to stay
away from antibiotics in STEC cases. Because HUS causes kidney failure
and acute anemia, victims are typically treated with dialysis and
other emergency measures.

It's not yet clear whether this strain of _E. coli_ is more virulent
than others, or whether there are massive numbers of milder cases that
have gone undetected, Tauxe added.

Germany's top health official said 373 people [now 470 -- see [1]
above] have come down with HUS, in which _E. coli_ [toxin] attacks the
kidneys, often requiring critical care. Another 796 people in the
country have been hit by less serious infection with the _E. coli_.
The northern city of Hamburg and surrounding areas have been worst
affected. In a typical year, Germany might see 60 cases of HUS,
officials said.

Investigators in Europe continued to scramble Tue 31 May 2011, to
detect the source of the unprecedented outbreak that has been tied to
raw cucumbers, lettuce or tomatoes. European Union officials said
Germany identified cucumbers from the Spanish regions of Almeria and
Malaga as possible sources of contamination. [But the contaminant from
Spain was a different strain -- see [2] above].

Another suspect batch may have originated in the Netherlands or
Denmark. The vegetables could have been contaminated at any point on
the journey from field to retail outlets.

Though FDA officials are flagging incoming produce from Spain for
infection, they don't expect huge quantities of vegetables. In all of
May 2011, for instance, the USA imported one shipment of Spanish
cucumbers, or 480 cases. So far, there is no indication that the
shipment was contaminated, DeLancey said.

The vast majority of _E. coli_ infections have affected either
Germans or people who recently traveled to Germany. Other
[Germany-related] cases have been reported in Denmark, France, the
Czech Republic, the UK, the Netherlands, and Switzerland but the WHO
said it only had confirmation of the German cases and another 6 cases
in France.

[6] Overall discussion

Germany's _E. coli_ epidemic, which has killed as many as 15 people
so far [16 now -- see [1] above], has alarmed doctors, who have never
seen such an aggressive intestinal bacterium before. Epidemiologists
are desperately searching for the origin of the deadly bacteria.

The eeriest thing of all, according to Rolf Stahl, is the way
patients change. "Their awareness becomes blurred, they have problems
finding words, and they don't quite know where they are," says Stahl.
And then there is this surprising aggressiveness. "We are dealing with
a completely new clinical picture," he notes.

Stahl, a 62-year-old kidney specialist, has been the head of the
Third Medical Clinic and Polyclinic at the University Medical Center
Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) for almost 18 years. "But none of us doctors
has ever experienced anything quite like this," he says. His staff has
been working around the clock for the last week or so. "We decide at
short notice who can go and get some sleep."

But Stahl only sees the most severe cases, those in which EHEC
[enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_] also attacks the blood, kidneys and
brain. These patients suffer from a life-threatening complication
known as hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). About 10 days after the
diarrhea begins, the red blood cells suddenly disintegrate, blood
clotting stops working, and the kidneys fail. In many cases patients
need dialysis to stay alive. "The situation is deteriorating
dramatically for our patients," says Stahl.

In Germany, about 60 people a year contract hemolytic-uremic syndrome
after being infected with EHEC. Last week [week of 23 May 2011], there
were as many cases in a single day. According to the Robert Koch
Institute (RKI), the national German institution responsible for
disease control and prevention, there were 276 HUS patients in German
hospitals by Fri 27 May 2011. By Tue 31 May 2011, there were 373
confirmed cases of HUS across Germany. As many as 15 people [16 -- see
[1] above] may have died from EHEC in Germany so far in the current
outbreak. Cases have also been reported in Sweden, Denmark, Britain,
Austria, and the Netherlands.

The story of the outbreak began in Stahl's clinic. When the 1st
patient suspected of having contracted HUS was admitted there on a
Wednesday evening 2 weeks ago, none of the doctors had any idea what
they were facing. "We weren't even thinking of EHEC at first," says
Stahl, "because it normally only affects children." In adults, on the
other hand, HUS can also be caused by genetic defects and autoimmune
diseases, or as a side effect of cancer treatment. By the next day,
however, there were suddenly 7 or 8 cases on the ward, and the
laboratory reported that they were all infected with EHEC. Hamburg
promptly notified the Robert Koch Institute.

The process that began at that point and reached its preliminary
climax at the end of last week [week of 23 May 2011] with the closing
of 2 vegetable production operations in Spain is an example of
impressive epidemiological detective work. It involves close
cooperation among vigilant doctors, epidemiologists thinking
practically, and detail-oriented laboratory scientists.

For the disease control experts at the RKI, it was primarily a matter
of addressing 2 tasks simultaneously and as quickly as possible: to
find the contaminated food products and to determine the type of
bacterium involved.

Helge Karch, the director of the RKI's EHEC consulting laboratory at
the Munster University Hospital in western Germany, has devoted almost
his entire life as a researcher to EHEC bacteria. "But I've never
encountered something like this," he says. The 1st stool sample
arrived in his lab on Monday [23 May 2011]. The 1st cases had already
appeared in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia by then. Karch's staff
members began their analysis right away. The result was clear by
Wednesday evening, 25 May 2011: It was the extremely rare serotype
O104:H4.

After searching through a database for medical journals, Karch found
only one article under the search term "O104:H4": a case study from
Korea. In the Korean case, as in most of the German cases, an adult
woman had contracted EHEC, which is completely atypical for EHEC.

Karch speculated over why the disease wasn't happening in children,
as is normally the case, but only in adults. And why was the infection
striking more people that ever before in Germany? Karch and others
speculate that the problem could lie in the pathogen itself. Perhaps
the genetic material of this rare bacterium has mutated again, so that
its toxin or its bond to the intestinal cells it damages has become
stronger. Doctors hope that a complete sequencing of the genome, which
is now being performed, will offer some answers.
