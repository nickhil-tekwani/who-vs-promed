E. Kellon misquoted the Experientia 1990 paper. In that paper, limited
dilution of the wild-type virus was used. Under the experimental conditions
tested, control groups had ~50% mortality, and the stressed group reached
100% mortality.
Since than we have developed a highly attenuated strain of WNV. This strain
-- WN-25A -- will not kill mice at 2x107 pfu (higher titers were not
tested), while the wild-type virus has an LD50 of approx. 4.0 pfu.
This attenuated virus was also tested in stressed mice at 2x107 pfu (the
same paradigm as the quoted Experientia paper) without causing any illness.
We believe that the WN-25A strain is a good candidate for vaccine
development.
