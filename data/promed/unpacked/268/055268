Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS) has been found in a fish farm on the
Aland Islands, Finland.
An Alandic expert has said that there might be a threat to fish farming as
a result of the disease and the fact that it was found in Finland. The only
way to get rid of the disease, which reportedly kills 90% of the infected
young, is to kill the entire infected population and start over with
healthy stock.
