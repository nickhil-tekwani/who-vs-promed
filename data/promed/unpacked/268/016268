[This is the 2nd part of the daily update following the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on selected countries of interest. To reduce the size of these posts, there will be changes over the coming days. The tables will be reduced but are available at the source URLs and will be referred to in the summaries of daily changes for each country. Countries that have almost interrupted transmission and have been lifting restrictions (China, South Korea) and have lessons to learn as they attempt to prevent explosive 2nd waves will continue to be profiled. We will attempt to select countries from each region on a daily basis. - Mod.MPP]

[According to the report above, in the past 24 hours, there have been 11 newly confirmed cases in China, 5 of which were imported and 6 locally acquired -- the latter all in Beijing. No new deaths were reported. Also, 1 new case was reported in Hong Kong, none in Macau. A total of 1808 imported cases have been reported. There have been no new deaths reported for several weeks, further supporting a reduced level of cases in the country.

There were 7 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic individuals in the past 24 hours -- 5 were imported. There were no cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The recent previous reports of a conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic were on 4, 6, 8, 9, 10 and 11 Jun 2020 when 1 conversion was reported each time. Prior to that, there were 2 cases on 1 Jun 2020, and a single case was reported on 18 May 2020 (COVID-19 update (194): China, S Korea, countries w/ high local trans, Italy phase 2 20200519.7352327).

Recurrent questions: What is the total number of asymptomatic cases? What is the total number of asymptomatic cases that converted to symptomatic? What is the proportion of asymptomatic imported cases that have been linked to transmission chains resulting in outbreak clusters?

[In the past 24 hours, according to the report at the source URL, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 49 cases and 0 new deaths, compared with 56 cases and 1 new death in the previous day (12 Jun 2020). (Of note, yesterday's report had a total of 12 003 cases, whereas today the report says there were 12 002 cases.) The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 67 consecutive days. Today's (13 Jun 2020) breakdown of cases: 44 cases were locally transmitted, and 5 were imported cases. Locally acquired cases were in Seoul (29), Gyeonggi (13), Incheon (1) and Chungnam (1). Imported cases were in Daegu (3), Gyeonggi (1), and Quarantine (1). Note that 12 provinces did not report any newly confirmed cases.

Updated tables and graphs can be found at Notice 371 https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030.

The impression (hasn't changed): Lifting of measures has been accompanied by increases in locally acquired infections through increasing clusters related to gatherings of people at employment (bringing it outside employment to contacts) and in houses of worship, and bars and clubs. It just takes one super-spreader in a crowded place to transmit and lead to a sizeable cluster.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 236 305 cases, including 34 223 deaths, up by 163 cases and 56 deaths in the past 24 hours. The previous day's (11 Jun 2020) 24-hour change was 379 cases and 53 deaths. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are still in decline. As it has been, the major increase in cases was in Lombardy, reporting 272 newly confirmed cases.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in Lombardy, the original epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna, Lazio, Piedmont, and Liguria (see tables at http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_notizie_4885_0_file.pdf and http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_notizie_4885_1_file.pdf). Lombardy again reported the largest number of newly confirmed cases in the 24-hour period (272) and was the only province reporting more than 50 new cases. Also, 16 provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (7 provinces reported no new cases), with another 3 provinces reporting fewer than 50 newly confirmed cases. Campania reported a decrease of 229 cases without an explanation.

The top 5 provinces by cumulative case count remain unchanged and are Lombardy, followed by Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Tuscany. The top 5 provinces by number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours are Lombardy (272), followed by Emilia-Romagna (33), Piedmont (31), Lazio (27), and Liguria and Tuscany, both with 7 cases each.

Italy is now 39 days post phase 2 initial opening up and 23 days post 2nd stage of phase 2 opening up. See summary observations of the Ministry of health in section B, immediately below.

B. Monitoring report

Key points
----------
- The analysis of the data relates to the period 1-7 Jun 2020, following the 2nd reopening phase that took place on 18 May 2020. For the times that elapse between exposure to the pathogen and the development of symptoms and between these and the diagnosis and subsequent notification, probably many of the cases reported this week contracted the infection 2-3 weeks before, i.e., between the 1st and 2nd reopening phases (between 11 and 25 May 2020).

- Overall, the picture of the transmission and impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Italy remains low critical. There is a general decrease in the number of cases and an absence of signs of overload of the assistance services.

- In some regional situations, the number of new cases reported each week is still high, albeit decreasing. This should call for caution, as it indicates that in some parts of the country the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 is still relevant.

- Furthermore, in almost the whole Peninsula, new cases of infection were diagnosed in the monitoring week. This finding, which is largely due to the intense screening and investigation of cases with identification and monitoring of close contacts, nevertheless highlights how the epidemic of COVID-19 in Italy has not ended.

- It is essential to keep attention high and to continue to strengthen testing-tracing-tracking activities in order to identify all potential transmission outbreaks early and continue to control the epidemic.

- It is also essential to maintain the general population's awareness of the fluidity of the epidemiological situation and the importance of continuing to rigorously comply with all the measures necessary to reduce the risk of transmission such as individual hygiene and physical distancing.

Conclusions
-----------
- The lock-down measures in Italy have effectively allowed a control of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the national territory even in a context of persistent widespread transmission of the virus with a very different incidence in the 21 Regions/PPAA. The situation described in this report, mainly relating to the period between the 1st and the 2nd transition phases, is overall positive.

- Transmission signals remain with new cases diagnosed in the monitoring week and with possible outbreaks. This describes a still epidemiologically fluid situation that requires rigorous compliance with the measures necessary to reduce the risk of transmission such as individual hygiene and physical spacing.

- It is necessary to maintain the resilience of local services high to continue promoting awareness and compliance of the population, to carry out active research and diagnostic assessment of potential cases, the isolation of confirmed cases, the quarantine of their close contacts. These actions are essential to control transmission and possibly quickly identify and deal with epidemic outbreaks.

[4] Iran: 182 545 total cases, 8659 deaths
Date: Fri 12 Jun 2020

https://www.reporter.am/irans-death-toll-from-coronavirus-surges-beyond-8600-middle-east-monitor/


Iran today [12 Jun 2020] confirmed 75 more fatalities from the novel coronavirus in the past 24 hours, bringing the nationwide death toll to 8659. A further 2369 people tested positive for COVID-19, raising the overall case count to 182 545, Health Ministry spokesperson Sima Sadat Lari said.

According to the [spokesperson], 144 649 people have to date recovered and been discharged from hospitals, while 2739 patients remain in a [critical] condition. Some 1.19 million tests have been performed in the country currently, Lari said.

Iran is witnessing an upward trend in daily infections in lots of provinces, particularly in the southwestern Khuzestan province, because of the easing of restrictions on movement. Despite the rising amount of infections, government employees have resumed work, and mosques reopened over the Middle Eastern country. Shopping malls also have reopened.

[As of 12 Jun 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran is 182 545, including 8659 deaths, an increase of 2369 new cases and 75 deaths since 11 Jun 2020.

Iran has started relaxing restrictions on a more widespread basis in the country. As stated previously, with the increasing daily case reports having surpassed the prior peak in late March-early April 2020, it is clear that there is now a 2nd wave, most likely due to too early lifting of restrictions. The key concern will be whether people begin travelling again within the country and may transport the virus from one zone to another.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 2 116 922, including 116 825 deaths, an increase from 2 089 701 cases and 116 034 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York City had a cumulative total of 205 846 as of 13:00 EDT (GMT-4) on 12 Jun 2020 including 17 351 confirmed deaths and an additional 4692 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

The top 10 states in terms of daily reported cases in descending order are California, Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Arizona, New York, Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, and Arkansas. New states on this list are Tennessee and Arkansas.

In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by New Jersey, California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Texas, Pennsylvania, Florida, Michigan, and Maryland, unchanged from yesterday (11 Jun 2020). A total of 38 states and entities have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html) has data on cases, hospitalization, testing and epidemiologic variables such as age, race, ILI (influenza-like illness), surveillance and emergency room visits -- definitely worth reviewing, a welcome series of analyses.
