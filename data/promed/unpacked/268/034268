In the fall of 2017, University of Florida and farmers began reporting an unprecedented sudden decline of peanuts prior to harvest. Symptoms included stunted plants, late-season yellowing and distinctive marginal leaf necrosis. Entire fields wilted. Yields [were] off by as much as 45 per cent. Onset of some symptoms followed the passage of Hurricane Irma. The condition was most acute in sandy soils. It was estimated that 25 000 acres of peanuts in peninsular Florida were affected. Some of the symptoms were also observed in southern Georgia, but nowhere was the impact remotely as severe as in Florida.

Soil and plant samples were submitted for nutrient and disease testing. The results were inconclusive, though the symptoms seemed easily associated with well-documented maladies. Nematodes, diseases and tomato spotted wilt [virus] could not be consistently associated with affected areas nor could soil nutrient issues. There was agreement that something very serious had occurred [and] that the cause was likely the result of a number of interacting factors. Growers in 2018 should implement as many best management practices as they can.

[A large number of fungi are known to affect peanuts, as well as several species of nematodes, bacterial/phytoplasma pathogens and viruses. The latter include _Tomato spotted wilt virus_ (genus _Tospovirus_) mentioned above, which has a very wide host range (for more information see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives).

Similar symptoms may be due to different pathogens or other factors, as well as a combination of several of these (as mentioned above). It is not stated in this report what diagnostic methods were used so far and there may be more sensitive ones still to be applied. However, to determine a biotic or abiotic cause for a disease or disorder of unknown aetiology may take years (see also ProMED-mail post 20171228.5526316) and would be complicated considerably if a previously unknown pathogen were to be involved.

Effective control measures will need to be based on reliable diagnosis of the pathogen(s) causing the problem. In the absence of a conclusive diagnosis, disease management may include phytosanitary measures, certified clean seeds and crop rotation.
