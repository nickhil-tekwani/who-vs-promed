26 more typhoid cases reported in Delmas
----------------------------------------
Mpho Gabashane, Mpumalanaga health department spokesperson, says 26 more
cases of typhoid have been reported in Delmas in the last 24 hours.
Gabashane says 10 people have been discharged, while 65 are still
hospitalized. Health promotion activities continued in Delmas yesterday, 20
Sep 2005, as authorities waited for the results of tests that might
determine the source of the disease that has claimed 4 lives and made more
than 500 people ill.
Since it was 1st presented to health workers on 11 Aug 2005, a number of
departments have been involved in isolating the source of the disease and
preventing its further spread. Carin Bosman, senior manager for resource
protection and waste with the national department of water and forestry,
says these tests included tests on various samples of water, as well as
tests on milk and meat products. So far, tests on drinking water have
tested negative for _Salmonella typhi_, the organism that causes the
illness. Bosman stresses the importance of following proper hygiene
practices. Gabashane says the health workers' message is effective, and the
number of cases is dropping.

Scientists look at DNA to find traces of typhoid
------------------------------------------------
A team of scientists from Free State University is using forensic methods
to look for the bacteria causing typhoid fever in Delmas's water. The
department of water affairs and forestry says the polymerase chain reaction
testing is able to pick up traces of the DNA of salmonella, even if live
bacteria are no longer present in the water. The team last night [19 Sep
2005] took samples of water for analysis.
Juliet Mannya, a spokesperson for the Mpumalanga health department, says
the department is purifying water with chlorine; it is advising people to
boil water before use and to wash vegetables and meat before eating or
cooking them. Experts say the absence of the bacteria in the water points
to the illness being spread by humans.

[Typhoid fever can be foodborne, the food being contaminated by a
chronically infected food worker. An outbreak of this magnitude, however,
suggests water borne spread due to water contaminated with human waste. -

Government denies Tac claims of 49 typhoid deaths
-------------------------------------------------
The Mpumalanga health department has labeled baseless and extremely
irresponsible a report by the Treatment Action Campaign (Tac) that the
government was not giving accurate reports of typhoid deaths. Tac claims 49
people died of the typhoid outbreak in Delmas. The department announced in
a statement the death of the 4th person.
Dr Gerhard Swart of Communicable Diseases says: "We are seeing a lot less
patients than what we saw last week [3rd week September 2005], except for
the typhoid patients with signs and symptoms of typhoid. They are still
seen here at the hospital and at the clinic and referred here; but even
some of our referrals are less than what it was." The number of people with
typhoid now stands at 526. The water affairs department is still
investigating the source of the outbreak.

Typhoid worries
---------------
After dengue, typhoid fever is emerging as the next worry of Dagupenos. The
city listed 5 cases of typhoid fever, and the City Health Office is wasting
no time to prevent more cases. All barangay health workers (BHW) were told
to double their efforts in monitoring the drinking water in their
respective barangays.
City Health Officer Leonard Carbonell said typhoid fever comes from dirty
water and dirty food. He urged everyone to make sure their food intake is
clean and water is free from dirt and disease-causing organisms.
Barangay Salisay, the barangay with the largest number of cases, however,
reported negative results based on water examination by health officers.
