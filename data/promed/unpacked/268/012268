I think all of us who have worked in the 'Third World" have been frustrated
over the unwillingness of many countries to admit to any medical problem
with international implications.
[SNIP
The Third World truly is a different world, and it is necessary to
differentiate the desirable from the feasible. A small point this, but I
think it is unfair and incorrect to talk as if it is only "third world"
countries that are selective in their disease reporting. Would that it were
so.

That would make efforts to bio-engineer oral vaccines into common
foodstuffs all the more important as a contribution to global health---the
economic disincentives to reporting of infectious diseases are perverse,
but unavoidable and understandable in a free-trade-oriented world.
However, if the contribution to world health of the developed-world's
agro-businesses could be made "enlightened self-interest" through subsidies
to designing in the antibody-inducing proteins and glycoproteins, I think
we would have a win-win situation. Your thoughts?

[We will never know "your thoughts" because we are cutting this string. I
cannot resist commenting that although Dr. O'Neil is correct in saying that
"economic disincentives to reporting of infectious diseases are perverse" I
cannot agree that they are unavoidable or understandable. If all that
matters in this world is money, I am in the wrong world. - Mod.CHC
