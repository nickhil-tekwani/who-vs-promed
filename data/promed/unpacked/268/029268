A buck deer taken by a hunter in northeastern Utah has tested positive for
Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD), the Division of Wildlife Resources has
announced.
"The Division of Wildlife Resources has been looking for Chronic Wasting
Disease in Utah since 1998," said Jim Karpowitz, big game coordinator for
the Division of Wildlife Resources. "When the Colorado Division of Wildlife
discovered a CWD-positive deer near the town of Craig in early 2002, we
decided to intensify our surveillance efforts, focusing on mule deer
populations along the Colorado border."
Nearly 1500 brain samples were collected from deer and elk in Utah in fall
2002. Almost 1400 of the deer and elk have been tested for CWD so far, with
only one positive sample.
The positive sample came from a mature buck deer taken this fall on Diamond
Mountain, just north of Vernal. Utah State University is conducting CWD
testing for the DWR. See URL above for map.
"It's important to remember that there is currently no evidence that CWD
can be naturally transmitted to humans or livestock," Karpowitz said. "It
also does not appear to cause catastrophic die-offs in deer and elk
populations."
A great deal of research is being conducted by many agencies and
organizations to learn more about this relatively new disease. "Until more
is known, we'll continue to be diligent with our surveillance and
management efforts and provide the public with the most current information
available," Karpowitz said.
Another excellent source of information is a national Web site run by the
Chronic Wasting Disease Alliance (cwd-info.org). "This site includes links
to CWD information on other Web sites," Karpowitz said. "I would encourage
people to link from it to Wisconsin's site, which has some excellent
information about CWD."

Chronic wasting disease found in Utah buck
----------------------------
The discovery of chronic wasting disease in a Utah deer was not unexpected
but also not welcome.
''I'm not surprised, but a little disappointed,'' said Jim Karpowitz, state
Division of Wildlife Resources big game coordinator. ''It'll change the way
we do business. If it's a limited area, we'd be happy.''
The disease was found in a sample from a mule deer buck killed by a hunter
last fall [2002] on Diamond Mountain, north of Vernal in northeastern Utah.
This first confirmation of the disease in the state was reported Tuesday.
Utah officials plan to aggressively expand testing in the wake of the
discovery.
The state Department of Natural Resources had increased its surveillance
for the disease since a deer near Craig, Colorado, tested positive for it
in early 2002.
The disease has been known since at least the 1970s in Colorado and
Wyoming. It has been found more recently in Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota,
Montana, New Mexico, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Wisconsin, and Canada.
Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is in the same family as bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease. It is a degenerative brain
disorder characterized by tiny holes that give the brain a spongy appearance.
"It's important to remember that there is currently no evidence that CWD
can be naturally transmitted to humans or livestock," Karpowitz said,
"I killed an elk last year in eastern Utah and my son Dan killed a deer,
and we intend to eat both of them," he said.
The Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization have said
there is no evidence that people can contract the disease from eating deer.
However, mad-cow disease did jump the species barrier in Europe, and the
issue remains under study.
The World Health Organization advises people not to eat any deer or elk
that's known to be infected with the disease, and it also suggests against
consuming certain tissues of any deer or elk, including the brain, spinal
cord, eyes, spleen, tonsils, and lymph nodes.
Utah hunters cannot have meat in their freezer tested, but in the future
animal heads can be tested at Utah State Diagnostic lab in Logan.
