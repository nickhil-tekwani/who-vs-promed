Hepatitis E Virus: First Description in a Pet House Rabbit. A New Transmission Route for Human? Authors: C. Caruso, P. Modesto, R. Prato, F. E. Scaglione, L. De Marco, E. Bollo, P. L. Acutis, L. Masoero and S. Peletto
------------------------------------------
Summary:
In this work, we identified for the 1st time hepatitis E virus (HEV) in a pet house rabbit, an adult 7-year-old female domestic rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_). Importantly, the resulting phylogenetic tree showed that the HEV strain identified in the pet house rabbit was closely related to a human HEV sequence; this finding reawakens concerns regarding the zoonotic risk represented by HEV in animals and adds house rabbits to the spectrum of potential sources of infection for humans. Potential for domestic transmission of HEV to humans should be taken into account.

Strains of hepatitis E virus (HEV) were found in rabbits (wild and farmed) in USA, Mongolia and France. Other reports showed that other mammals such as pigs, deer, rats, mongooses, ferrets, chickens, and trout also may harbor strains of HEV. - Mod.PMB]

[The rabbit died suddenly. It had been regularly vaccinated against rabbit hemorrhasgic disease & myxomatosis. - Mod.JW
