Since 1 Apr 2015, a total of 11 cases of human plague have been reported in residents of 6 states: Arizona (2), California (1), Colorado (4), Georgia (1), New Mexico (2), and Oregon (1). The cases in Georgia and California residents have been linked to exposures at or near Yosemite National Park in the southern Sierra Nevada Mountains of California. Nine of the 11 patients were male; median age was 52 years (range = 14-79 years). Three patients aged 16, 52, and 79 years died.

Plague is a rare, life-threatening, flea-borne zoonosis caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_. During 2001-2012, the annual number of human plague cases reported in the USA ranged from 1-17 (median = 3 cases) (1). It is unclear why the number of cases in 2015 is higher than usual. Plague circulates among wild rodents and their fleas in rural and semirural areas in the western USA (2). Transmission to humans occurs through the bite of infected fleas, direct contact with infected body fluids or tissues, or inhalation of respiratory droplets from ill persons or animals, including ill domesticated cats and dogs (3). The usual incubation period between exposure and illness onset is 2-6 days.

In humans, plague is characterized by the sudden onset of fever and malaise, which can be accompanied by abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. There are 3 main forms of plague, depending upon the route of infection. Bubonic plague, resulting from the bite of an infected flea, accounts for approximately 80-85 percent of cases; patients develop a "bubo," a painful swelling of one or several lymph nodes that progresses during the 1st few days of illness. Septicemic plague, accounting for approximately 10 percent of cases, can occur from a flea bite or from direct contact with infectious fluids; infection spreads directly through the bloodstream with no localizing signs. Primary pneumonic plague, occurring in approximately 3 percent of plague patients, results from aerosol exposure to infective droplets and is characterized by a fulminant primary pneumonia. Secondary pneumonic plague can result from the spread of _Y. pestis_ to the lungs in patients with untreated bubonic or septicemic infection.

The mortality rate for untreated plague has ranged from 66 percent to 93 percent; however, in the antimicrobial era, mortality has been reduced to approximately 16 percent (4). Prompt treatment with antimicrobials such as aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, or doxycycline greatly improves outcome (4).

Health care providers should consider the diagnosis of plague in any patient with compatible signs or symptoms, residence or travel in the western USA, and recent proximity to rodent habitats or direct contact with rodents or ill domestic animals. Suspicion of plague should prompt 1) collection of blood, bubo aspirate, or sputum samples for _Y. pestis_ diagnostic testing; 2) implementation of isolation and respiratory droplet precautions for patients with respiratory involvement; 3) immediate antimicrobial treatment (before laboratory confirmation); and 4) notification of public health officials. _Y. pestis_-specific testing is available at state health laboratories. Recommendations for diagnostic testing and antibiotic treatment are available at http://www.cdc.gov/plague/healthcare/clinicians.html. Misidentification of _Y. pestis_ as _Pseudomonas luteola_ and other organisms through the use of automated bacterial identification systems has been reported (5).

Persons engaging in outdoor activities in areas where plague is endemic should wear long pants when possible and use insect repellent on clothing and skin. Persons also should avoid direct contact with ill or dead animals and never feed squirrels, chipmunks, or other rodents. In addition, pet owners should regularly use flea control products on their pets and consult a veterinarian if their pet is ill. Rodent habitat can be reduced around the home by removing brush, clutter, and potential rodent food sources such as garbage or pet food.
