In October 2001 I interviewed a Costa Rican rabies researcher who had
spent years trying to develop an aerosolized rabies vaccine that
could be sprayed into caves to immunize bats.

Most of what he told me was under embargo, as he did not want to
generate excessively high hopes until he had something perfected, and
also had to protect intellectual property. None of his findings have
been published to the best of my knowledge.

Has anyone heard anything further about the development of a rabies
vaccine for bats, aerosolized or otherwise?

[It is likely that bats will develop an immune response to most
existing rabies vaccines -- for example, see "Response to vaccination
with a commercial inactivated rabies vaccine in a captive colony of
Brazilian free-tailed bats (_Tadarida brasiliensis_). Turmelle AS,
Allen LC, Schmidt-French BA, et al: J Zoo Wildl Med. 2010 Mar; 41(1):
140-3" (abstract available at
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20722268>). However an effective
method of delivery has yet to be described, as far as I am aware. - Mod.CP]
