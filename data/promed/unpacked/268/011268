A 4th American who contracted EVD in West Africa was expected to arrive in the USA for care Tue [10 Sep 2014] and will be treated at Emory University Hospital, Atlanta where 2 other aid workers successfully recovered from the disease, the hospital said Mon [9 Sep 2014]...

The World Health Organization, however, said one of its doctors, who has been working in an EVD treatment center in Sierra Leone, has tested positive for the disease. It said the doctor was in stable condition Mon 9 Sep 2014 in Freetown and will be evacuated. The State Department said the doctor was from the USA.

[2] Liberia: situation report
Date: 8 Sep 2014

Situation assessment - 8 Sep 2014

***Many thousands of new cases are expected in Liberia over the coming 3 weeks. [ProMED emphasis] As soon as a new EVD treatment facility is opened, it immediately fills to overflowing with patients, pointing to a large but previously invisible caseload.

Transmission of the ebolavirus in Liberia is already intense, and the number of new cases is increasing exponentially. The investigative team worked alongside staff from the Ministry of Health, local health officials, and other key partners working in the country. All agreed that the demands of the EVD outbreak have completely outstripped the government's and partners' capacity to respond; 14/15 of Liberia's counties have now reported confirmed cases. Some 152 health care workers have been infected, and 79 have died. When the outbreak began, Liberia had only one doctor to treat nearly 100 000 people in a total population of 4.4 million people. Every infection or death of a doctor or nurse depletes response capacity significantly.

Of all Ebola-affected countries, Liberia has the highest cumulative number of reported cases and deaths, amounting, on 8 Sep 2014, to nearly 2000 cases and more than 1000 deaths. The case-fatality rate, at 58 percent, is also among the highest.

In Montserrado county, which includes Liberia's capital, Monrovia, the team estimated that 1000 beds are urgently needed for the treatment of currently infected EVD patients. At present, only 240 beds are available, with an additional 260 beds either planned or in the process of being put in place. These estimates mean that only half of the urgent and immediate capacity needs could be met within the next few weeks and months. The number of new cases is moving far faster than the capacity to manage them in EVD-specific treatment centres... WHO estimates that 200 to 250 medical staff are needed to safely manage an Ebola treatment facility with 70 beds...

The John F Kennedy Medical Center in Monrovia, which was largely destroyed during Liberia's civil war, remains the country's only academic referral hospital. The hospital is plagued by electrical fires and floods, and several medical staff were infected there and died, depleting the hospital's limited workforce further.

The fact that early symptoms of Ebola virus disease mimic those of many other common infectious diseases increases the likelihood that EVD patients will [unknowingly] be treated in the same ward as patients suffering from other infections, putting cases and medical staff alike at very high risk of exposure.

In Monrovia, taxis filled with entire families, including some members who are thought to be infected with the ebolavirus, crisscross the city searching for a treatment bed. There are none. As WHO staff in Liberia confirm, no free beds for EVD treatment exist anywhere in the country. According to a WHO staff member who has been in Liberia for the past several weeks, motorbike-taxis and regular taxis are a hot source of potential ebolavirus transmission, as these vehicles are not disinfected at all, much less before new passengers are taken on board.

When patients are turned away at Ebola treatment centres, they have no choice but to return to their communities and homes, where they inevitably infect others, perpetuating constantly higher flare-ups in the number of cases. Other urgent needs include finding shelters for orphans and helping recovered patients who have been rejected by their families or neighbours.

Last week, WHO sent one of its most experienced emergency managers to head the WHO office in Monrovia. Coordination among key partners is rapidly improving, aiming for a better match between resources and rapidly escalating needs.

Conclusions
--------------
The investigation in Liberia yields 3 important conclusions that need to shape the EVD response in high-transmission countries.

1) Conventional EVD control interventions are not having an adequate impact in Liberia, though they appear to be working elsewhere in areas of limited transmission, most notably in Nigeria, Senegal, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

2) Far greater community engagement is the cornerstone of a more effective response. Where communities take charge, especially in rural areas, and put in place their own solutions and protective measures, EVD transmission has slowed considerably.

3) Key development partners who are supporting the response in Liberia and elsewhere need to prepare to scale up their current efforts by 3-4-fold...

WHO and its Director-General will continue to advocate for more EVD treatment beds in Liberia and elsewhere, and will hold the world accountable for responding to this dire emergency with its unprecedented dimensions of human suffering.

A total of 1011 Indians, who have returned from EVD-affected areas, are being tracked for the virus, the heath ministry said on Sun [8 Sep 2014]. Most of those being tracked are from Maharashtra, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, West Bengal and Delhi. During the past 24 hours, 201 passengers from the affected countries have arrived at the airports of Mumbai (88), Delhi (58), Chennai (24), Bangalore (15), Kochi (11), Thiruvananthapuram (4) and Kolkata (1). The health ministry said that while no passenger has been isolated at the quarantine facility on Sun [7 Sep 2014], 16 531 passengers have been screened to date. All respective state governments have been provided with the details.

[6a] Vaccine trial, shipment delayed

Vaccinated monkeys have developed "long-term" immunity to the ebolavirus, raising a prospect of successful human trials, say scientists. The experiments by the US National Institutes of Health showed immunity could last at least 10 months. Human trials of the vaccine started this week in the USA and will extend to the UK and Africa.

Canada's experimental EVD vaccine was stuck in the government lab that developed it as officials puzzled over how to safely transport it, 3 weeks after it was offered to Africa to fight the deadly epidemic. Ottawa said on 12 Aug 2014 that it would donate between 800 and 1000 doses of the vaccine to the World Health Organization for use in Africa, where more than [2000] people have died from the disease. The vaccines are being held at Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg. "We are now working with the WHO to address complex regulatory, logistical and ethical issues so that the vaccine can be safely and ethically deployed as rapidly as possible," Health Canada spokesman Sean Upton said in a statement. "For example, the logistics surrounding the safe delivery of the vaccine are complicated." One challenge is keeping the vaccine cool enough to remain potent, Upton said. Canadian officials were trying to define proper storage and transportation procedures, and they could not estimate when the vaccines would leave the lab.

[8] Prevention & suspected cases

Senegal: Vigilante "border guards" keeping EVD out of Senegal
----------------------------
7 Sep 2014: (AFP) A dozen Guineans await deportation at a Senegalese frontier police post, stopped in their tracks by the foot soldiers of an informal battalion of villagers at the forefront of a fight to keep Ebola out. These new vigilante "border guards" are becoming an increasingly common sight since a Guinean student brought the deadly epidemic raging across west Africa into Senegal just before the border closed on 21 Aug 2014. He remains the only case in the country, in part, say these villagers, because of the vigilance they have shown. "They were trying to cross the border. We arrested them with the help of the villagers. We are waiting for the order to send them back," said a policeman in Dialadiang, one of the last towns before the frontier. "Last week, we sent back a Cameroonian and 2 Sierra Leoneans. Villagers arrested them for us to send them back," the officer added at the town's decrepit police post.

Sierra Leone: lockdown
-------------------------
6 Sep 2014: (InvestmentWatch) Sierra Leone imposes 4-day countrywide "lockdown" beginning on 18 Sep 2014 to stop EVD spread... No one allowed to leave their homes. Doctors Without Borders calls "lockdown" a mistake... "Lockdowns and quarantines do not help control EVD, as they end up driving people underground and jeopardising the trust between people and health providers. This leads to the concealment of potential cases and ends up spreading the disease further." ...

Kenya/Ghana
----------
6 Sep 2014: (By Robert Alai Onyango on Facebook) The port health services JKIA [Jomo Kenyatta International Airport-Nairobi] have been notified by WHO of an EVD suspect[ed case] who flew in one hour ago [12 noon local time] on board flight KQ503. The passenger had been isolated in Accra, Ghana, and was supposed to be subjected to series of confirmatory tests which he has not undergone as required. The passenger is a Sierra Leone passport holder. He claims to be a CNN reporter based in Nairobi. He said that he was arriving back after covering an EVD case in Sierra Leone. Kenya Airways [KQ] was supposed to park the aircraft in remote parking to facilitate port health personnel to carry out prompt action. KQ bosses are refusing to heed this.

Liberia: quarantine
-------
6 Sep 2014: (Malawi24) Liberian officials today confirmed that a police barracks in central Monrovia was shut down after the wife of one of the officers died of EVD. Information Minister Lewis Brown said the officers decided to "self-quarantine." About 35 officers live in the barracks with their families, said Abraham Kromah, deputy director of the national police force. Liberian Christian leaders planned to convene about 100 "prayer warriors" at ... Providence Baptist Church, where Liberia's declaration of independence was signed in 1847. A state of emergency in Liberia restricts public gatherings, though church services have largely continued unimpeded.

[9] Sierra Leone: UNICEF relief
Date: 8 Sep 2014
Source: AllAfrica [edited]
http://allafrica.com/stories/201409081192.html


A cargo plane of UNICEF medical supplies including protective equipment and essential medicine has just landed in Sierra Leone, part of the UN children's agency's continued drive to tackle the EVD outbreak in West Africa. The 48 metric tonnes of supplies, including latex gloves, body bags, intravenous tubes, antibiotics and other essential medicines, and coveralls to protect health workers, will be provided to health teams, including those from the Ministry of Health and non-governmental organizations working to contain the outbreak. This latest airlift brings up to 402 metric tons [MT] the overall quantity of essential items UNICEF has delivered to the 3 major EVD-affected countries in 32 shipments since early August [2014]. Of the total, 70.6 MT were flown in to Guinea, 213.8 MT to Liberia and 117.7 MT to Sierra Leone.

Topping the list is protective equipment like latex gloves and masks for health workers, concentrated chlorine disinfectant, antibiotics, pain relief medicines and intravenous fluids and equipment. Next week, UNICEF will begin sending 50 000 household protection kits to Liberia. The kits are designed for families caring for their relatives at home and contain a range of protective items such as sprayers, chlorine, gloves and garbage bags.

[There is no mention of masks in the household protection kits. While the other items will help, the big problem will be carers touching their faces with contaminated gloves to wipe away sweat and tears or to scratch itches. There needs to be eye, nose and mouth protection as well, as ebolavirus can enter the body by touching them with contaminated hands or gloves. Also, the outsides of garbage bags will become contaminated after being handled by gloves used on a patient or to clean up after them. - Mod.JW]
