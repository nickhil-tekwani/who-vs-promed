The cattle disease _Mycoplasma bovis_ has been found on a farm in the Northland region for the first time.

The Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) says the infected property is a dry stock beef farm. It was identified through the tracing of animals' movements from known infected farms.

Northland Rural Support Trust coordinator Julie Jonkers said the farm was 1 of 2 that had been on watch for the disease, and the diagnosis was not a surprise.

The trust was working with the family running the farm and it was difficult for the farmers involved.

The confirmation brings to 36 the number of farms actively infected with the disease. A further 30 farms which were infected have been cleared of their stock and declared safe to repopulate.

_Mycoplasma bovis_ can cause lameness, mastitis and abortions in cows.

In May the government announced it would try to eradicate the cattle disease, ordering about 152 000 cows to be culled in a phased programme that is expected to take 1 to 2 years.

[The first paragraph here is confusing. It says this is first case in the Northland. Yet back in August of 2018 there was another case posted from the Northland; "A Northland dry stock farm has tested positive for _Mycoplasma bovis_, the first confirmed infection in the region. Biosecurity New Zealand said on [Thu 30 Aug 2018] that a property in Northland had tested positive for the cattle disease, taking the number of infected properties nationwide to 37." Posted on ProMED-mail as Mycoplasma bovis, bovine - New Zealand (13): (NTL) 20180831.6000606.

So, one has to wonder if the farm in today's news is actually the 2nd farm on the watch list as there was a previous case in August [2018]. Or is this actually the same farm?

The more farms being found positive for _Mycoplasma bovis_ makes me to think this disease may well have been in the islands much longer than was originally believed. If that assumption is proven true, it is exceptionally sad news for all producers, for those involved in attempting to eradicate a disease potentially already endemic, and for those involved in footing the bill. - Mod.TG
