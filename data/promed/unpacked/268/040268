Packs of rabid dogs roaming parts of war-ravaged Kabul have been attacking
people and infecting them with rabies, a Red Cross doctor said Wednesday.
In the last 5 days, Dr Allah Nawaz told The Associated Press that 24
people, many of them children, have been treated at the hospital for rabies.
In nearby Ghazni province, where treatment has not been available, 90
people died of rabies last month, he said.
Officials at the ministry of public health in Kabul are calling it an
emergency. They didn't have figures, but said many of the bite victims have
died, either because they arrived at hospitals too late for treatment or
were unable to buy the medicine.
At most hospitals in Kabul, except for the two being operated by the
International Red Cross, medicines have to be purchased by the patient. The
Taliban's health ministry does not have the money to stock the hospitals.
