The regional health agency (ARS) of the Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur region (PACA) and the Var prefecture announced on Thursday [21 Aug 2014] the discovery of the 1st indigenous case of dengue fever transmitted by the Asian tiger mosquito [_Aedes albopictus_] in the Var department.

ARS said: "As of now, this is a single and geographically isolated case. The infected person consulted a doctor, and his [health] status was not worrisome. We talk of indigenous cases when a person contracts the disease in the national territory and has not traveled in an area where the virus has been circulating for the past 15 days."

After the confirmation of the 1st case of infection in the Var, the department was officially placed on level 2 of the national plan to combat the spread of chikungunya and dengue fever [viruses]. Mosquito control and eradication are underway near the residence of the infected person.

[There have been rare cases of locally transmitted dengue virus in southern France in previous years. There are populations of the Asian tiger mosquito breeding there. Given the movement of people from dengue virus endemic areas into southern France, occurrence of additional cases would not be surprising.

ProMED thanks Michel Rosenheim for sending in this report. - Mod.TY

It would be interesting to discover where the vector mosquito acquired her infection, or how close to the location of an imported case in France this person might have travelled. Would any medical entomologist reading this be prepared to speculate on the flight range of a tiger mosquito within a week around the patient's home within 2 weeks of onset (allowing for the extrinsic incubation period in the mosquito followed by the incubation period in the patient, local wind & weather conditions? - Mod.JW
