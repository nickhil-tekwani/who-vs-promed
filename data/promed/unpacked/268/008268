An outbreak of legionnaires' disease is responsible for the deaths of 2 people in east-end Montreal, according to public health officials. At a news conference Wednesday [4 Aug 2021], officials said they have identified 10 cases of the disease since mid-June [2021], including the deaths of 2 people over the age of 65. The area of concern is bordered by Pie-IX Boulevard to the west, Highway 25 to the east, Highway 40 to the north, and the Saint-Lawrence River to the south.

Legionnaires' disease is a respiratory infection often associated with pneumonia. It is contracted by breathing in airborne water droplets that are infected with legionella bacteria.

Dr David Kaiser, with Montreal Public Health, says his team hasn't identified a shared source of the infections, though they are investigating several possibilities, including water-cooling towers, aqueducts, splash pads, and water heaters. Kaiser said residents should ensure water heaters are set to temperatures above 60 [deg C/140 deg F] in order to kill bacteria.

Montreal usually reports around 50 cases annually of legionnaires' disease. An outbreak in 2012 in Quebec City was blamed for 14 deaths and 181 total cases.

[The news report above describes an outbreak of 10 cases of legionnaires' disease since mid-June 2021 in a defined area of east-end Montreal. At this point, we do not know if we are dealing with a cluster of unrelated cases or a common-source outbreak. The investigation into finding a common source for these 10 people is proceeding, but genotyping the clinical isolates would help establish whether this is a common source outbreak, if the genotypes match. However, if the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping. Matching the genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates of legionella will identify the environmental source for the individual cases. We will await further findings from the investigation of the 10 cases.

Possible sources include aerosols generated from a legionella-contaminated plumbing system by showerheads, sink faucets, cooling towers, decorative fountains, and hot tubs/spas. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 C (77-104 F) support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems.

Eradication of legionella bacteria from plumbing systems is often difficult. Long-term persistence within these water systems is favored by the intracellular location of legionella within several species of protozoa, where legionella replicate and which provide protection from environmental stressors, like biocides and heat treatment; also, the formation of biofilms allows adherence of legionella to the inner surfaces of the plumbing systems (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5835138/).

_Legionella pneumophila_, the usual _Legionella_ species causing legionellosis in the USA, has been shown to persist for long periods in biofilms in a viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state after exposure to a biocide or heat treatment (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515819/). Monitoring _L. pneumophila_ in water systems usually done by culture would miss VBNC _Legionella_, which can be revived by the subsequent addition of amoeba (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18839249).

Montreal, with a population of 1.7 million residents in 2016, is the 2nd-most populous city in Canada and the most populous city in the Canadian province of Quebec. The East End of Montreal, where the outbreak is located, is composed of the Montreal boroughs of Rivière-des-Prairies-Pointe-aux-Trembles and Anjou, and the City of Montréal-Est (https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Montreal/East_End).
