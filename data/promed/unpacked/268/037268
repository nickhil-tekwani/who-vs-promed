When it comes to COVID-19, it seems where Israel leads, the rest of the world follows. For almost a year, the country has offered other nations a glimpse into the pandemic's future. Israel has been at the forefront of vaccination rollouts for adults and teenagers, pioneered a vaccine passport, and, in recent months, spearheaded the use of booster shots.

At the end of July [2021], the country began offering boosters to those over the age of 60; since late August [2021], boosters have been available to anyone over the age of 16, 5 months after their 2nd dose of the vaccine. Now, a person is not considered fully vaccinated in Israel until they have received a 3rd dose of the vaccine, once they are eligible for it.

More than 3 months on, Israeli health officials say the data are clear: booster shots helped bring down the 4th wave of the virus that swept the country in August and September [2021]. At its peak, that wave saw more than 8000 new COVID-19 cases per day, and more than 500 people at a time hospitalized in serious condition. The current 7-day average is running at between 450 and 500 cases a day, and there are 129 people hospitalized in serious condition with the virus.

The data highlight stark differences between those with the vaccine -- and the booster -- and those without: on many days over the past month, more than 75% of positive cases were among the unvaccinated, according to data from the health ministry. Among those hospitalized with COVID-19, it is even clearer: Israeli officials say in October [2021], the rate of people over the age of 60 in serious condition who had only had 2 doses of the vaccine was 5 times that of those with 3 shots. And although the caseload has declined overall since then, the differences remain: on Sunday [21 Nov 2021], there were 4 times as many people over the age of 60 in serious condition who had only had 2 shots, compared to those considered fully vaccinated with 3 doses, according to the health ministry.

Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has cited such data as a reason why he thinks it will soon be recommended that everyone get boosters once they're eligible. "If you look strictly at the data from Israel, it's very clear that the differences in immunity waning is much more profound in the elderly, but it goes across the board," Fauci told NBC last week.

The lesson from Israel is one that more and more nations are taking on, particularly as cases rise to troubling levels in parts of Europe. Germany is recommending a 3rd dose of the vaccine for everyone over the age of 18 and, in the UK, boosters are available to everyone over 40 as of this week. In France, demand for booster shots skyrocketed after President Emmanuel Macron announced that a 3rd dose would be required to revalidate the "pass sanitaire", or health pass, which is required on public transport and to enter a variety of public and private spaces. And in the United States, boosters are now authorized for everyone over 18.

Health experts say the rollout of booster shots across many Western nations highlights the inequity of vaccine deployment in other parts of the world. In the UK, 88% of people over the age of 12 have had their 1st dose of the vaccine, 80% have had 2 doses, and 26% have already had a booster shot, data from 20 Nov [2021] shows. By contrast, only 10% of people in African countries have had a 1st dose, on average, according to Our World in Data; only 7% of Africa is fully vaccinated, the data shows.

But the news from Israel is not all good: though case numbers have fallen since September [2021], the decline has plateaued. And, even more concerning, the R-rate -- the average number of people infected by each person with COVID-19 -- is back above 1, according to health ministry data, a worrying sign that the virus may be spreading again. Health experts, such as Professor Eran Segal from Israel's Weizmann Institute, say it is too early to tell whether the country is entering a 5th wave of the virus. But they point to the fact that almost 1.5 million people who have had 2 doses of the vaccine have not gone back for their booster shot. "There are more people whose vaccine has faded over time, when compared to the number of new vaccinations and boosters, which has led to a slow decrease in the total [population's] immunity," Segal tweeted last week.

Now Israel is working on holding back that potential 5th wave: officials are encouraging the unvaccinated to get their shots, and those who are eligible for booster doses to get them. They are also getting children vaccinated and keeping up with preventative measures. Many of Israel's new infections are among children aged 5-11, according to Israeli health officials. A campaign to vaccinate that age group began on Monday [22 Nov 2021]. "About 50% of our daily infections are occurring in that age group of below 11," Dr Ran Balicer, chairman of Israel's COVID-19 National Expert Advisory Panel, told CNN last Friday [19 Nov 2021]. "We think this vaccination campaign could actually turn the tide and perhaps bring us back to a downslope if we have a good uptick [in vaccinations], as we hope that we will."

But even with a highly vaccinated population, health experts say it is vital that anti-COVID measures stay in place, especially during winter, as activities move indoors. Nachman Ash, director general of Israel's Public Health Ministry, told Israel's Channel 13 that part of the reason for the uptick in cases is people not adhering to rules like mask-wearing. "The enforcement is not sufficient," Ash said. "And I see the public is becoming relaxed as time passes and the infection rate goes down, so people are less careful. Therefore, yes, we have to increase the enforcement."

Balicer warned that ignoring the waning immunity of those who have had 2 doses of the vaccine "may, in fact, put people at risk with false reassurance. There is no single magic bullet that would suffice to assure surge prevention, especially in wintertime," Balicer said. "It is a combination of measures: indoor masks, population behavior, indoor event restrictions, and green certificates, and an effective booster campaign."

[2] WHO: statement on vaccination for children and adolescents

Interim statement on COVID-19 vaccination for children and adolescents
---------------------------------------------------------
WHO, with support of the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization and its COVID-19 Vaccines Working Group, is reviewing the emerging evidence on the need for and timing of vaccinating children and adolescents with the currently available COVID-19 vaccines which have received Emergency Use Listing (EUL). SAGE is continuously reviewing the literature and has reached out to vaccine manufacturers, the research community, and Member States to obtain the most complete and recent data on the issue. This interim statement was developed with additional support from the Strategic and Technical Advisory Group of Experts (STAGE) on maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health, and nutrition.

Background
Although the majority of COVID-19 vaccines are only approved for use in adults aged 18 years and above, an increasing number of vaccines are now also being authorized for use in children. Some countries have given emergency use authorization for mRNA vaccines for use in the adolescent age group (aged 12-17 years): BNT162b2 developed by Pfizer, and mRNA 1273 developed by Moderna. In November 2021, one stringent regulatory authority approved the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 for the use in children aged 5-11. Trials in children as young as age 3 years were completed for 2 inactivated vaccines (Sinovac-CoronaVac and BBIBP-CorV), and these products were approved by Chinese authorities for the age indication of 3-17 years; although these vaccine products have received EUL for adults, they have not yet received WHO EUL for children. Covaxin, an adjuvanted inactivated vaccine developed by Bharat, was approved in India for the age indication of 12-17 years, but not yet received WHO EUL for this age indication. The Indian regulatory authorities have given approval to ZycovD, a novel DNA vaccine, for ages 12-17 years; however, this vaccine has not yet received WHO EUL. Several COVID-19 vaccines are undergoing trials in younger age groups (including as young as 6 months of age), but results have not yet been published.

The greatest burden of disease in terms of severe disease and deaths remains among older persons and those with comorbidities, the evidence of which led to the WHO Prioritization Roadmap, which identifies high-priority-use groups according to vaccine supplies available to countries (1). WHO recognizes that various countries are in different pandemic phases with different vaccination coverage rates. The WHO global vaccination strategy targets remain: 40% of each country's population by end of 2021, and 70% by mid-2022 (2). These coverage targets were set to ensure an equitable pace of global vaccine rollout and prioritization of those at highest risk. To date, these targets have not yet been achieved.

This interim statement examines the role of COVID-19 vaccines in adolescents and children in the global context of inequitable vaccine distribution across countries and globally limited vaccine supply.

Burden of disease in children and adolescents
Overall, there are proportionally fewer symptomatic infections and cases with severe disease and deaths from COVID-19 in children and adolescents, compared with older age groups. Age-disaggregated cases reported to WHO from 30 Dec 2019 - 25 Oct 2021 (3) show that children under 5 years of age represent 2% (1 890 756) of reported global cases and 0.1% (1797) of reported global deaths. Older children and younger adolescents (5-14 years) account for 7% (7 058 748) of reported global cases and 0.1% (1328) of reported global deaths, while older adolescents and young adults (15-24 years) represent 15% (14 819 320) of reported global cases and 0.4% (7023) of reported global deaths. Deaths for all ages less than 25 years represented less than 0.5% of reported global deaths.

Children and adolescents usually demonstrate fewer and milder symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to adults and are less likely than adults to experience severe COVID-19 (4). Milder symptoms and asymptomatic presentations may mean less frequent care-seeking in these groups; thus, children and adolescents tend to be tested less, and cases may go unreported. An age-dependent risk of severe disease with those under one year of age experiencing more severe disease has been suggested (5), although several reviews show that neonates (infants in the 1st 28 days of life) have mild disease when compared with other paediatric patients (6,7). It is important to note that children under the age of 5 years have a higher risk of other diseases with clinical presentations that overlap with COVID-19, such as pneumonia and other viral upper respiratory tract infections, which may lead to misclassification. Additionally, age disaggregation has not been systematically provided in the literature, and the results of these studies are context-specific depending on factors such as timing within the pandemic and an emphasis on hospitalized patients (8).

Children and adolescents can experience prolonged clinical symptoms (known as "long COVID-19", post-COVID-19 condition (9), or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection); however, the frequency and characteristics of these conditions are still under investigation. Additionally, a hyperinflammatory syndrome, referred to as paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) in Europe and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) in the United States, although rare, has been reported to occur worldwide and complicate recovery from COVID-19 (10).

Several risk factors for severe COVID-19 in children have been reported recently, including older age, obesity, and preexisting conditions. The preexisting conditions associated with higher risk of severe COVID-19 include type 2 diabetes, asthma, heart and pulmonary diseases, and neurologic and neuromuscular conditions (11).

The preponderance of evidence on the risk for severe COVID-19 and death in children and adolescents comes from studies in high-resource settings, so the applicability of the following observations to lower-resource settings remains to be determined. One systematic review suggests that there may be larger impact of paediatric COVID-19-related fatality in low- to middle-income countries versus high-income countries (12).

The role of children and adolescents in transmission of SARS-CoV-2
Multiple population-based SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and viral shedding studies have investigated whether children and adolescents are infected at the same rate as adults, but the results have been mixed, possibly because of the studies being conducted at different time points in the pandemic when populations were subjected to different public health and social measures (PHSM) (13). A serosurvey done in India during June-July 2021 after the 2nd wave (delta variant) showed that seropositivity in children 6-18 years was similar to that in older age groups, except in those older than 60 years in whom the immunization rate was high. Overall, it appeared that whether schools were open or closed, infection rates in children and adults were similar. Thus, it appears that children of all ages can become infected and can spread the virus to others.

Outbreaks of COVID-19 have been identified in secondary schools, summer camps, and day-care centres, particularly when neither physical distancing nor masks were used to reduce infection transmission risk. There is some preliminary evidence that younger children may be less infectious, as measured by secondary attack rates, than adolescents and adults (14). Data on the global incidence of COVID-19 suggest adolescents test positive for SARS-CoV-2 at a higher proportion than younger children; however, seroprevalence surveys are required to provide more conclusive information on infection rates.

Children who become infected with SARS-CoV-2 shed the virus in their respiratory tract and also in their faeces (15). Among individuals positive for SARS-CoV-2 who were tested at the same time point after symptom onset, levels of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA shedding in the respiratory tract appeared similar in children, adolescents, and adults (16).

The relationship between age, viral load, and transmission across the full symptom spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been comprehensively investigated because people with no, or mild, symptoms are seldom tested systematically. The relative transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 at different ages remains uncertain, largely due to the challenges involved in disentangling the influences of biological, host, virus, variants of concern, and environmental factors (17).

Conclusions
Countries should consider the individual and population benefits of immunising children and adolescents in their specific epidemiological and social context when developing their COVID-19 immunisation policies and programs. As children and adolescents tend to have milder disease compared to adults, unless they are in a group at higher risk of severe COVID-19, it is less urgent to vaccinate them than older people, those with chronic health conditions, and health workers.

There are benefits of vaccinating children and adolescents that go beyond the direct health benefits. Vaccination that decreases COVID transmission in this age group may reduce transmission from children and adolescents to older adults and may help reduce the need for mitigation measures in schools. Minimizing disruptions to education for children and maintenance of their overall well-being, health, and safety are important considerations. Countries' strategies related to COVID-19 control should facilitate children's participation in education and other aspects of social life and minimize school closures, even without vaccinating children and adolescents (24). UNICEF and WHO have developed guidance on how to minimize transmission in schools and keep schools open, regardless of vaccination of school-aged children (25).

Aligned and coordinated action is needed to achieve the global COVID-19 vaccination targets. Given current global inequity in vaccine access, the decision to vaccinate adolescents and children must account for prioritization to fully protect the highest-risk subgroups through primary vaccination series, and as vaccine effectiveness declines with time since vaccination, through booster doses. As such, before considering implementing primary vaccination series in adolescents and children, attaining high coverage of primary series -- and booster doses as needed based on evidence of waning and optimizing vaccination impact -- in highest-risk subgroups, such as older adults, must be considered (26).

As a matter of global equity, as long as many parts of the world are facing extreme vaccine shortages, countries that have achieved high vaccine coverage in their high-risk populations should prioritize global sharing of COVID-19 vaccines through the COVAX facility before proceeding to vaccination of children and adolescents who are at low risk for severe disease.

It is of utmost importance for children to continue to receive the recommended childhood vaccines for other infectious diseases.
