Prevent anthrax by vaccinating your livestock
---------------------------------------------
Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) officials are encouraging livestock owners to vaccinate their animals after anthrax was confirmed in a cow in southeast Webb County in mid-April [2016].

"The anthrax vaccination is reliable and proven to protect livestock from the disease," said Dr Andy Schwartz, TAHC Interim Executive Director. "Livestock owners are urged to consult with their local veterinary practitioners about vaccination."

Anthrax cases in Texas are historically found in the triangular area bound by the towns of Uvalde, Ozona, and Eagle Pass. This area includes portions of Crockett, Val Verde, Sutton, Edwards, Kinney, and Maverick counties.

Anthrax is a bacterial disease caused by _Bacillus anthracis_, which is a naturally occurring organism with worldwide distribution, including certain parts of Texas. It is not uncommon for anthrax to be diagnosed in the southwestern part of the state.

Acute fever followed by rapid death with bleeding from body openings are common signs of anthrax in livestock. Carcasses may also appear bloated and decompose quickly. Livestock displaying symptoms consistent with anthrax should be reported to a private veterinary practitioner or a TAHC official. If affected livestock or carcasses must be handled, producers are encouraged to follow basic sanitation precautions such as wearing protective gloves, long sleeve shirts, and washing thoroughly afterward to prevent accidental spread of the bacteria to people.

For more information regarding anthrax, contact your local TAHC region http://www.tahc.texas.gov/agency/TAHC_RegionalOfficeMap.pdf, call 1-800-550-8242, or visit http://www.tahc.texas.gov.

[This is earlier than usual for anthrax outbreaks in Texas which usually start around June. This outbreak in Webb county is also in a county where we have not seen outbreaks for some time, so it is most likely an old site which had been ignored and thus, any intervening sporadic cases were not seen for what they were. And the ground recontaminated.

The usual region of Crockett, Val Verde, Sutton, Edwards, Kinney, and Maverick counties has been suffering a drought for about 3 years, so it has been relatively quiet anthrax-wise. With the rains this spring (2016) I would not be surprised if they again were active. And thus the TAHC advice to get livestock vaccinated.

This outbreak in Webb county in fact involved a bull and there is a possibility that "unexpected deaths" were also seen on neighbouring ranches.

The state of Texas can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=4212869,53177. A county map can be seen at http://geology.com/county-map/texas-county-map.gif. Webb county is in southern Texas on the Mexican border opposite Corpus Christi. The usually affected counties are to its immediate north. - Mod.MHJ]
