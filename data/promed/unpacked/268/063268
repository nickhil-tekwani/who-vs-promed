A Chinese city has ordered the destruction of all dogs within a 3 mile
radius of a rabies outbreak -- the 2nd major cull in less than a week.
Officials in Jining, the provincial capital of Shandong province, refused
to reveal how many of the city's 500 000 dogs would be killed in the latest
cull, which was ordered after the deaths of 16 local people this year.
Animal rights groups have condemned the extermination campaigns, which they
say are cruel, disproportionate, and evidence of the failure of the
country's vaccination and monitoring campaigns.
The outrage was sparked this week, when it emerged that police and public
health officials in Mouding -- a county in Yunnan province -- clubbed,
electrocuted, and buried alive 50 000 dogs to control the disease.
Regardless of vaccinations, no animal was spared apart from police and army
dogs.
An official from Jining's centre for disease control and surveillance said:
"I cannot reveal any information because this is an epidemic situation and
I need authorisation to talk." But the state media said all dogs within a 3
mile radius of every rabies case would be slaughtered. A total of 16
villages inside the municipality have been affected by the disease.
Mad dog disease, as rabies is called in China, [has killed] 2651 people in
2004. The number of cases has risen steadily in recent years because of a
rise in pet ownership and an irresponsibly low -- 3 per cent -- vaccination
rate.
But the World Health Organisation [WHO] says the recent countermeasures
have been excessive. "Rabies is a big problem for China and it is one that
is probably under-reported," said Roy Wadia of the UN agency's Beijing
office. "But we don't encourage this sort of dramatic culling. There would
be no need for it if adequate vaccination and surveillance measures were in
place."
Animal rights groups have complained that the slaughter is indiscriminate.
"This inhumane act has damaged China's international reputation," said He
Yong, of the International Federation for Animal Welfare. "Simply killing
dogs is no answer to rabies."
In the absence of a strong health system and effective monitoring and
reporting of diseases, China has frequently had to resort to mass culls.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 prompted the destruction of countless civet cats.
The bird flu epidemic has led to the slaughter of millions of ducks and
chickens.

[For a map showing the Shandong province, see
<http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2003-04/02/content_815399.htm>. Jining
is situated at Lat 35:26:49N, Lon 116:33:23E, map at
<http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?lat=25.3163&lon=101.534&scale=4000000&icon=x>.
To properly assess the (apparently excessive) control measures applied by
the Shandong authorities, it would help to obtain data on the number of
owned dogs vs. stray or abandoned dogs. In a rabies-stricken area, dogs are
expected to be vaccinated, muzzled and leashed.
The following figures related to number of reported human rabies cases (=
mortalities) since 1995, are derived from WHO Rabnet website:
1995 - 400
1996 - 159
1997 - 230
1998 - 234
1999 - 373
2000 - 505
2001 - 899
2002 - 1532
2003 - 2009
2004 - not available, but according to the above newswire this was 2651;
