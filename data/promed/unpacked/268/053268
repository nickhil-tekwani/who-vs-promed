In a follow-up on the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) situation in Kikuube district in the western part of the country, health officials report a 2nd case epidemiologically linked to the case patient as a primary contact.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the 1st case was confirmed on 28 Apr 2021 in a 16-year-old female from Munsiinsa-A village in the Kyangwali Refugee Settlement, Kikuube district on 27 Apr 2021.

The 2nd case is a 13-year-old male from Busisa-Kyangwali, who was admitted on 29 Apr 2021 with a high grade fever, blood in his urine and vomiting blood. A sample was shipped to the UVRI and returned PCR positive for CCHF on 4 May 2021.

Both patients are currently stable and showing signs of improvement. WHO says Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is known to be present in livestock in Uganda, and the country is experienced in responding to outbreaks of infectious diseases, as evidenced by the prompt diagnosis, isolation and treatment of the 2 cases so far.

[The above report describes the 2nd CCHF case reported from the Kikuube district, epidemiologically a contact of the index case reported earlier this month [May 2021].

CCHF has occurred sporadically in Uganda over recent years and is endemic there. The virus causes a viral hemorrhagic fever, and the virus is transmitted by ticks.

Uganda lies between countries that have frequent outbreaks of RVF [Rift Valley fever] and in which CCHF is endemic: Kenya, Somalia, Tanzania, and Sudan. A recent Food and Agriculture Organization risk analysis identified Uganda as at very high risk of amplification in some districts of the cattle corridor, which covers 52 districts cutting across the central part of the country from the southwest in Ankole-Kigezi to the northeastern region in Karamoja. The RVF virus has been isolated frequently in domestic animals in all affected areas. In addition, the practice of eating "sanga meat" (meat harvested from sick animals) in some districts heightens the risk of zoonotic transmission of both VHFs [viral hemorrhagic fevers, CCHF and Rift Valley fever]. At present, there is inadequate community engagement and social mobilization around the risks posed by these practices. Most of the 52 districts in the cattle corridor lack such engagement (http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/273497/OEW30-2127072018.pdf).

CCHF can cause serious disease in humans, with a case fatality rate of 10-40%. It can be responsible for severe outbreaks in humans, but it is not pathogenic for ruminants, their amplifying hosts. WHO states that the onset of symptoms in humans is sudden, with fever, myalgia, (muscle ache), dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, backache, headache, sore eyes and photophobia (sensitivity to light). There may be nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and sore throat early on, followed by sharp mood swings and confusion. After 2-4 days, the agitation may be replaced by sleepiness, depression, and lassitude, and the abdominal pain may localize to the upper right quadrant, with detectable hepatomegaly (liver enlargement). Other clinical signs include tachycardia (fast heart rate), lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes), and a petechial rash (a rash caused by bleeding into the skin) on internal mucosal surfaces, such as in the mouth and throat, and on the skin.

Public education, especially among individuals in contact with livestock or their products, is needed to prevent cases of CCHF infection. A One Health approach is needed for effective surveillance, with effective communication between animal health and human health professionals. - Mod.UBA]
