Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever Confirmed in Children in El Salvador
-------------------------------------------------------------
SAN SALVADOR: The Salvadorian Health Authorities confirmed the first 5
cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever in children [this year. Last year
dengue hemorrhagic fever killed 33 children and 2 adults. The Minister
of Health, Jose Lopez Beltran, confirmed on Mon 23 Jul 2001 at a press
conference that the cases were in children whose ages were between 1
and 3 years.
"In the year 2000 there were 127 cases confirmed; up to the present we
have 5 cases" assured Lopez Beltran. Saturday 4 of the children were
[admitted to the leading children's Hospital - Benjamin Bloom -- and
the other child was [admitted to the general hospital of the city of
Santa Tecla, to the west of San Salvador. Sergio Parada, director of
the Bloom Hospital, said that 2 of the 4 children admitted [to the
Bloom Children's Hospital were treated in the intensive care unit.
Parada stated that: "At the moment we cannot say who is at risk of
severe complications that might lead to death." He indicated that the
children came from the capital [San Salvador, surrounding
neighborhoods and from the northern department of Chalatenango on the
border with Honduras.
Beltran said that between January and July [2001, there have been
another 17 suspect cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever in the country,
and 883 suspect cases of classical dengue fever. Last year an epidemic
of dengue hemorrhagic fever in El Salvador caused the death of at
least 33 children and 2 adults among some 350 cases reported.
Teams of volunteers from Nicaragua, Guatemala, Mexico, Panama, the
United States, and Cuba contributed to the fight against the mosquito
transmitter of the lethal disease.

Dengue fever epidemic claims 38 lives in Vietnam
------------------------------------------------
An epidemic of the mosquito-borne dengue fever has claimed the lives
of 38 people in Vietnam since the start of the year [2001 and left
more than 14 000 others sick. The AFP news agency quotes a health
ministry official as saying that the number of dengue cases represents
a 74 percent increase over the same period of last year. The official
says the number of cases is still increasing in several Vietnamese
provinces. The outbreak is particularly [serious in the Mekong Delta
region and the central province
of Ha Tinh, where moist and humid conditions provide ideal breeding
grounds for mosquitoes.
