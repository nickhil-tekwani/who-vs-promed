Influenza in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
----------------------------------------------
In early January 2003, the Ministry of Health of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo reported an outbreak of acute respiratory
syndrome in Kinshasa. Serum and nasopharyngeal samples from 5
districts from Kinshasa were tested by Institut Pasteur, Paris.
Evidence from 16 of the 22 serum samples strongly suggests that
influenza virus A(H3N2) is involved in the current outbreak.
This virus has been circulating worldwide for several years.
Influenza vaccine containing the WHO recommended vaccine strains
protect against this influenza virus. Virus isolation and
characterization are currently underway.
The Ministry of Health conducted epidemiological studies from
December 2002 to mid-January 2003 in health zones and medical
institutions in Kinshasa; 14 medical institutions reported 3963
influenza cases including 126 deaths (case-fatality rate of 3.2
percent) and 33 health zones reported 27 211 cases including 170
deaths (case-fatality rate of 0.6 percent). The differences between
the case-fatality rates can be explained by differences in health and
nutritional status and access to health care services [with the more
severe cases ending up in hospitals. - Mod.JW]. Children under 5
years of age were the most affected.
The epidemiology of this outbreak is still not completely understood,
as limited resources have impeded a more thorough investigation.
However, Epicentre and Medecins sans Frontieres, France have recently
initiated more comprehensive data collection and analysis.

[Although the severe cases and deaths in Kinshasa have apparently not
all been definitively linked to influenza, the serologic evidence
appears at the least to indicate circulation of influenza A H3N2
viruses, which have caused many deaths in the U.S. and elsewhere over
the past three decades.
Without further information, the reported case-fatality rates (0.6%
in the health zones and 3.2% in hospitals) are difficult to
interpret. In developing countries, influenza deaths in H3N2
epidemics and other influenza virus epidemics typically predominate
in the oldest and youngest age groups, and in those with underlying
chronic diseases. Hopefully the investigations in Kinshasa will be
able to evaluate the risk of severe and fatal disease by age group
and underlying medical status, as these risk factors are presumably
different than in many developing countries (e.g., a younger
population, more cases of untreated HIV and other infectious
diseases, fewer debilitated elderly people, etc.).
The epidemiology of influenza is less well known in Africa and in the
developing world than in industrialized nations. However, it appears
likely that the burden of severe and fatal influenza is as bad or
worse in developing nations, in which infant mortality from
respiratory diseases may be high, and where effective medical care
for influenza complications like bacterial pneumonia may be less
available or less timely. It is interesting to note that in the last
10 or so years historians have begun to revise upward estimates of
the total world mortality caused by the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic,
from previous estimates of 20-25 million deaths to more recent
estimates that reach or exceed 50 million deaths. Most of this
difference is due to a greater appreciation of mortality in the
developing world. - David Morens, ProMED-mail Influenza Rapporteur]
