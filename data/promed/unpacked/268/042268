How Uganda Registered Ebola Success
-----------------------------------
On 27 May 2011 in Bombo, as outgoing minister of health, Stephen
Malinga, announced that the 25 people who had been in contact with the
girl who died from Ebola [hemorrhagic fever] were Ebola free, he also
told the story of how the outbreak was contained.

Dr Joseph Okware, Luwero's district health officer, says that on 1
May 2011, the lone victim of this year's [2011] Ebola outbreak fell
ill and her grandmother tried to treat her using modest means. She
took her to a clinic and after 3 days of treatment without any signs
of improvement, the [patient] was referred to another clinic in
Wobulenzi. However, her caretaker instead took her to Bombo Military
Hospital. Okware describes this as "good luck" because if the
[patient] had been taken to the clinic in Wobulenzi, a bigger number
of people could have become infected.

But because the staff at Bombo Military Hospital was experienced in
handling Ebola [hemorrhagic fever cases] -- having worked with Ebola
patients in Gulu and Bundibugyo [previously] -- they quickly
recognised the symptoms and took measures to curb its spread.
Unfortunately, they were unable to save her; she died 5 hours after
admission to the hospital.

To determine whether the people who had been contact with the girl
had Ebola or not, they were monitored for symptoms of the disease and
when they did not show any after 21 days, they were declared Ebola
free.

Even as Malinga congratulated the team at Bombo Military Hospital for
stopping what could have been an epidemic, he called upon the public
to remain vigilant. "We should celebrate because we have been
successful in controlling this outbreak but while we celebrate, we
should remember that other cases could be reported," Malinga said.

He called upon sick individuals to refrain from going to the
Namugongo shrine to celebrate Martyrs Day on Fri 3 Jun 2011 as they
might have Ebola and spread it to the masses that turn up to
celebrate. If there is anything this outbreak has shown, it is the
fact that if patients seek treatment from properly trained personnel,
epidemics can be averted.

Also, the fact that ordinary Ugandans can be lax about their health
was highlighted during this outbreak. [A woman], who runs a restaurant
near Bombo Military Hospital, said people were not bothered about the
disease. Instead, they simply went about their business, seemingly
unperturbed. Only one man expressed fear of the disease.

While it might be said that the people were right to be unperturbed,
[since] the crisis had been declared over, Malinga called for
vigilance. This means that individuals, especially those that are a
mere 40km [25 miles] away from Zirobwe (Bombo Military Hospital and
Zirobwe are 40km apart), cannot afford to relax.

[This report highlights the efforts made to contain the Ebola
hemorrhagic fever outbreak in Central Uganda as the index case was the
only person confirmed to have the disease. Therefore, to date, there
is no evidence that any of her close contacts contracted the disease,
since she sought treatment early enough from trained health care
workers, who had experience from previous Ebola outbreaks in the
country. If no further cases are confirmed, the outbreak should be
declared over as of 17 Jun 2011, 2 incubation periods after the lone
case in this outbreak died.

The Ugandan health authorities certainly deserve commendation for the
successful containment of this most recent outbreak of Ebola
hemorrhagic fever, despite some initial confusion and release of
contradictory information. Some questions remain to be answered,
however, in particular the source of the infection of the index
patient and the genetic relationship of this new isolate of Sudan
ebolavirus to previously isolated strains that in general have been
responsibly for extensive outbreaks of hemorrhagic fever. No doubt
these questions will be addressed in time and in the meantime it is to
be hope that the deadline of 17 Jun 2011 for final closure of this
episode will pass without remark. - Mod.CP]
