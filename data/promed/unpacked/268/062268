At least 33 people died of diarrhea, respiratory infection and undiagnosed

"More than 12 people died of diarrhea in the village of Badhu in Bajrua
district in the last week," Deepak Shah, acting chief of the district
health office, told reporters.
"8 other people died of an undiagnosed disease that spread in Barbise,
Naubise, Toli and Kailashmandau villages of the district in the last week,"
he said. A team of health workers has been dispatched to the epidemic
affected area, he added.
Meanwhile, about 13 people have died of respiratory illness in less than a
