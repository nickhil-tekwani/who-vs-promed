Officials have prepared anthrax vaccines while waiting for a
laboratory to confirm whether the virus [sic] has broken out in
Boyolali, Central Java.

Central Java Animal Husbandry Agency chief Witono said that samples
taken from residents, animals and soil in the area suspected to
harbor the [pathogen] would be analyzed by the Balai Besar veterinary
laboratory in Yogyakarta. "[We] are still waiting for laboratory test
results, which will come out in about one more week, to determine
whether [the samples contain] anthrax or not," he said on Monday [21
Feb 2011]. Witono said that the agency has prepared 3000 doses of
vaccine for use as needed in infected areas, such as places where
cattle were slaughtered.

As previously reported, several residents of Karangmojo village in
Boyolali allegedly contracted anthrax after eating beef.

A goat in Boyolali was found with the virus in 1993, according to Witono.

[Since 1998, Central Java has been identified in OIE reports as
having sporadic anthrax, but latterly their reports have lacked a lot
of geographic detail. A check on The Jakarta Post archives has failed
to reveal their "previous" report of anthrax in Karangmojo village.
They do list a 2002 report of an outbreak in Boyotali, which ProMED
reported (see below for details); see:
