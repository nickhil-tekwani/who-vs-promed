A bird flu outbreak that has puzzled scientists spread to 3 more Midwest turkey farms, bringing the number of farms infected to 23 and raising the death toll to more than 1.2 million birds killed by the disease or by authorities scrambling to contain it.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed on Saturday that the H5N2 strain of avian influenza was found among 38 000 birds at a commercial farm in Kandiyohi County in west-central Minnesota. It's the 3rd confirmed outbreak in Kandiyohi, which is the top turkey producing county in the country's top turkey producing state.

This was after the USDA confirmed late Fri 10 Apr 2015 that bird flu was found at 2 more South Dakota farms, saying it had infected a flock of 53 000 turkeys at a farm in McCook County and in a flock of 46 000 turkeys at a farm in McPherson County.

South Dakota State Veterinarian Dustin Oedekoven said crews were working Saturday to begin euthanizing any birds not killed by the highly contagious strain to prevent the virus from spreading.

Once those birds have been destroyed, the 23 farms in Minnesota, South Dakota, North Dakota, Missouri, Kansas and Arkansas will have lost more than 1.2 million turkeys, a small fraction of the 235 million turkeys produced nationally in 2014. Canadian officials also confirmed earlier in the week that a turkey farm in southern Ontario with 44 800 birds was hit, too.

Ken Rutledge, the CEO of Dakota Provisions, the only commercial turkey processing plant in South Dakota, said the more than 200 000 turkeys affected in the Dakotas so far account for about 5 percent of his total annual production.

"It probably will not impact our ability to service our customers, but is a serious impact in terms of lost volume at our plant and, obviously, is a severe impact to the growers themselves," Rutledge said.

In Minnesota, turkey producers have now lost over 900 000 birds.

Scientists suspect migratory waterfowl such as ducks are the reservoir of the virus. They can spread it through their droppings. They're still trying to determine how the virus has managed to evade the strict biosecurity that's standard practice at commercial turkey farms. The virus can be carried into barns by workers or by rodents and wild birds that sneak inside.

Dr. Beth Thompson, assistant director of the Minnesota Board of Animal Health, said the reason Minnesota has had so many cases has a lot to do with the fact that it's the country's top turkey producing state, and that it has a myriad of ponds and lakes that are attractive stopover places for migrating waterfowl such as ducks.

"We have to think about what Minnesota is. It's the "Land of 10 000 Lakes," bringing the wild waterfowl into Minnesota, and we're also number 1 in turkey production. I think that answers the question, that we do have a lot of turkey barns out there, and that is why we are seeing the infection rate we are in those facilities," she told reporters Friday.

Officials stress the risk to public health is low and that there's no danger to the food supply. No human cases have been detected in the U.S.

Because trucks and equipment provide a potential way to carry the virus onto farms, Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton signed an executive order Friday lifting seasonal weight restrictions for poultry feed trucks and trailers, and for emergency equipment being used in the response. His order said tightening biosecurity by reducing the number of trips to poultry farms is critical to lowering the risk of introducing the virus to non-infected farms. [This is an interesting statement -- that emergency response equipment may be responsible for assisting in the spread of the virus. The emergency equipment is on infected farms, and presumably cleaned before being on the roadway. So how does the equipment spread the disease? As it moves down the road? Or is the equipment not cleaned after it leaves a premises? Or is this a hint that vehicles belonging to the investigators may be spreading the virus? This seems unlikely in either case, as the farms appear to already be infected prior to the investigator or the depopulation equipment arriving. - Mod.TG]

While South Dakota's taken a drubbing in the last 2 weeks, Oedekoven, the state veterinarian, said tests on poultry living in the 10-kilometer quarantine zones of the state's 1st 2 farms have almost all come back without any signs of the disease. They're still awaiting a few results.

And he said for the time being, no other possible cases are pending confirmation in the state. "If we can get a couple nice days of sunshine here and have everybody just wash their boots and blow their nose, we'll hope for the best," he said.

The highly pathogenic strain of bird flu that has prompted the destruction of more than 1.2 million turkeys in the Midwest has taken a toll on South Dakota's only commercial turkey processing plant, but its CEO said his export business is virtually unaffected.

Ken Rutledge said Dakota Provisions has lost about 5 percent of its total production due to the H5N2 strain of avian influenza that has infected farms that sell live birds to the Huron plant. [This seems to be an important point -- that the infected farms all sell to the same processing plant. Is it possible that the trucks or the people returning to the farms are bringing back the disease from a plant that may be unconsciously incubating the disease? Or is this possibly just a coincidence? - Mod.TG]

The U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed this week that 3 more South Dakota farms had been hit with the highly contagious strain, 1 week after tests also showed it at a Beadle County operation. And North Dakota State Veterinarian Susan Keller said Friday the National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Iowa confirmed the H5N2 strain in a flock of 40 000 turkeys in Dickey County, which borders South Dakota in the southeast.

Once an infection is confirmed at a farm, usually all surviving birds on the property are killed to prevent it from spreading. More than 1.2 million birds in the Midwest have had to be destroyed since early March 2015 on at least 23 farms. The USDA does not compensate farmers for birds killed by the disease itself but does reimburse them for birds that have to be destroyed as a precaution.

Rutledge said Dakota Provisions processes birds from the farms that have been impacted in both South Dakota and North Dakota. Its Minnesota farms haven't been affected yet. "It probably will not impact our ability to service our customers but is a serious impact in terms of lost volume at our plant and, obviously, is a severe impact to the growers themselves," Rutledge said. "In terms of sales revenue, it's going to have an impact on us. No question."

Some countries have banned turkey exports from certain U.S. states, like Minnesota, and other countries, including China and Russia, have banned imports from the entire U.S, said Dr. Dustin Oedekoven, South Dakota's state veterinarian.

Rutledge said his export business is almost fully intact because his trading partners that have banned imports -- Hong Kong, Thailand and China -- receive mostly smaller parts of the bird like gizzards, livers and hearts.

"We have some minor parts that we do routinely send to the Far East, and those items are banned and we're not able to ship those," he said. "Our major trade partner for Dakota Provisions -- I mean our overwhelming trade partner -- is Mexico."

Mexico is among the countries scaling back bans on imports to just include affected counties in Minnesota, which is huge because it's by far the biggest foreign customer for U.S. turkey, said Jim Sumner, president of the USA Poultry and Egg Export Council.

"If Mexico were doing the same thing that the countries in the Far East are doing, then we would have a serious problem," Rutledge said.

U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said this week she wants to make it clear to federal officials that other countries should not use the outbreak as an excuse to block U.S. turkey imports.

[As stated in the beginning of the article, the processing plant has had birds from the infected farms in South Dakota. The question then becomes, is the same situation occurring in Minnesota?

Minnesota is home to 3 turkey processing companies with a total of 7 processing plants around the state. http://www.foodprocessingtechnology.com/projects/dakotaprovisions/

Jennie-O Turkey Store, the world's 2nd largest processor of turkey, owns plants in Willmar, Melrose, Montevideo, Pelican Rapids and Faribault, with an additional plant in Barron, Wisconsin. Jennie-O Turkey Store handles approximately 1.342 billion pounds of turkey annually (2008) and is a subsidiary of Hormel Foods Corp. Its Minnesota plants employ about 5300 workers, producing annual sales of USD 750 million and total economic activity of more than USD 2 billion.

Turkey Valley Farms has 1 plant in Marshall and is ranked 16th among all turkey processing companies in the U.S.

Northern Pride, Inc., a growers cooperative, owns 1 plant in Thief River Falls and is ranked 20th among all turkey processing companies in the U.S. - Mod.TG
