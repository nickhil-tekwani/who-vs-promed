This past week 3 more cases of pertussis were reported at Coupeville Elementary School, bringing the total to 10 students and an adult. Island County and school health officials say that more reports of cases of this contagious disease are possible at the 350 student school. The county health department reports at least 42 confirmed and probable cases of pertussis, also called whooping cough, on Whidbey and Camano islands as of 5 Jun 2012. 8 of the local students who contracted the disease had been vaccinated against pertussis, school nurse Tina Lewis said.

It is very likely most adults have not received the pertussis vaccine for adolescents and adults. Everyone over age 12 should have received at least one dose of the Tdap [or DTaP; tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis], said Island County health officer Roger Case. The immunization booster is required for school attendance for those over 11 years old. "It is estimated that less than 10 per cent of the population has actually received the Tdap immunization," Case said.

Before the development of the pertussis vaccine, the United States typically saw about 200 000 cases a year, she said. In 2010, 27 550 cases of whooping cough were reported across the nation, the highest number since 1959, she said.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has found that immunization reduces the odds of contracting pertussis, especially for children. "Children who never received any doses of DTaP vaccine face odds of having whooping cough at least 8 times higher than children who received all 5 doses of the vaccine," Patti said.

To help control the spread of disease, the Grant County Health District and several clinics are offering free Tdap vaccine for uninsured Grant County adults (or adults whose health insurance does not cover the cost of the vaccine) and have close contact with infants and young children. "If you think you qualify for this program, first contact your health care provider," states Carol Schimke, immunization coordinator and public health nurse. She adds, "If you do not have a health care provider or your provider does not have the free Tdap vaccine, please contact us at the Moses Lake Office at 509-766-7960."

Due to the increasing number of whooping cough cases in Grant County and the State, contact your health care provider if you are coughing or are concerned that you may have been exposed to whooping cough. It is very important that you stay home and away from other people while waiting for test results or for 5 days while you are taking medication if your doctor tells you that you have whooping cough.

Whooping cough 2012
-------------------
Washington State: 2092 cases compared to 164 cases in 2011 during the same time period.
Grant County: 13 cases reported. Before the 2010-2011 outbreak, Grant County had an average of 2-4 cases a year.

Flathead City-County Health Department officials have reported 3 more pertussis (whooping cough) cases, raising the county total to 56 and adding Somers Middle School to the list of affected school districts. The new cases included 2 children who were not given the recommended antibiotic treatment after the health department informed their families of their exposure.

Referred to as prophylactic treatment, the antibiotic [azithromycin - Mod.LL] regimen usually takes 5 days and kills the bacteria that spread the highly communicable disease to others. "Most disturbing is that one of the cases was not started on prophylaxis due to the health care provider not feeling it was necessary," county health officer Joe Russell said. "We follow the nationally recognized guidelines for identifying close contacts of known pertussis cases. Information regarding close contacts generally comes from the schools and the cases. When recommended intervention strategies are not followed, we can expect additional cases."

Community health director Jody White said, "We are concerned with our infant population as they are too young to be immunized and don't have the naturally acquired abilities to fight the infection," White said. "Protecting infants is essential, as hospitalization rates can run higher than 50 per cent and there is a one per cent chance that a hospitalized infant will die."

An infant recently arrived at Maine Medical Center [MMC] in Portland coughing and vomiting uncontrollably. The diagnosis was whooping cough, a highly contagious respiratory disease that's breaking out in pockets across Maine. Most of the 80 cases reported in a surge of whooping cough, or pertussis, in the state in 2012 have struck middle school-aged children. In 4 cases, children under 6 months old were sickened.

The baby at MMC was treated with antibiotics and recovered, said Leah Mallory, a pediatric hospitalist at MMC. For other babies, the unrelenting cough can prove life threatening, according to Dr Lawrence Losey, a pediatrician at Parkview Adventist Medical Center in Brunswick. "They are coughing so hard and so long that they run out of oxygen and it can cause brain damage and seizures," he said.

"Just over 60 per cent of infant pertussis is gotten from a family member; half of those are from mom," said Losey, who was recognized last month [May 2012] by the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention for his work in childhood immunization. The danger pertussis poses to babies is one reason public health officials are pushing for better vaccination rates in Maine.

Cases of whooping cough are up significantly from 2011. So far in 2012, there have been 80 cases reported statewide, according to the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention. During the same period in 2011, 49 cases were reported. The spike in pertussis first cropped up in northern Maine, followed by outbreaks at schools in Skowhegan and Scarborough. Most cases this year have been reported in Somerset, Cumberland, York, and Penobscot counties.

Maine is among 20 states that allow parents to exempt their children from school-required immunizations based on philosophical objections. Without an exemption, kindergarten students in Maine must be vaccinated against pertussis, diphtheria, tetanus, measles, mumps, rubella, polio, and chickenpox. About 3.5 per cent of Maine students attended school in 2009-10 without a vaccination, with the majority of parents citing religious and philosophical objections. Some cited medical reasons. The exemption rate inched up from 3.33 per cent the previous year, but remained lower than a peak rate of more than 4 per cent in 2007-08. Parents who skip vaccines say they object to the number of shots and fear a link between immunization and autism, according to a 2008 report by the Muskie School of Public Service.

The Utah County Health Department is continuing to investigate new cases of pertussis, also known as whooping cough, every week. In 2012, 96 cases have been reported throughout the county, which is more than the cases recorded in 2009 and 2010 combined.

In 2011, the health department reported 157 cases of whooping cough, the highest number of cases in Utah County in more than 5 years and Dr Joseph Miner, executive director of the Utah County Health Department, said the county is on track to pass that number in 2012.

An outbreak of whooping cough in Hillsborough County has struck 10 schools, 9 public and 1 private. Now health officials worry that summer camps, outings, and family vacations may allow the illness, also known as pertussis, to spread even more widely. "Kids will be fanning out to various churches, camps, and community centers, which increases the opportunity to spread pertussis and the number of people who will be exposed," said Warren McDougle, epidemiology program manager for the Hillsborough County Health Department. "The school year ending isn't necessarily going to bring us relief from this outbreak."

So far in 2012, Hillsborough County has seen about 40 cases. In 2011, Hillsborough reported just 2 cases between January and June.

Pertussis, or whooping cough, continues to spread through the Cedar Valley and across the state. Black Hawk County has seen 13 cases in April and May [2012], according to Kaitlin Emrich, disease surveillance program manager with the county health department. 4 of those were reported at East High School and another 4 at Hoover Middle School. However, numbers have slowed down the past few weeks. "I don't know if that's because schools are letting out (for the summer), and kids are outside," Emrich said. "It's less likely to spread in an outdoor environment."

Communicable disease staff has been working closely with school nurses to track down infected persons and alert those with whom they've been in contact, she said. As additional people display symptoms, health officials follow up to make sure they are tested and receive treatment if necessary. They've also been educating health care providers.

According to the IDPH [Iowa Department of Public Health], the past 5 years have seen an average of 91 cases of pertussis compared to 270 cases in 2012 as of 25 May 2012. That's a nearly 200 per cent increase, though no pertussis-related deaths have been reported to IDPH in 2012. Historically, pertussis has been cyclical, with increased activity observed every 3 to 5 years.

Around north east Iowa in 2012, 33 investigations have been completed in Fayette County, 8 in Cerro Gordo, 3 in Buchanan, and 4 in Delaware. Polk County has logged 55 cases, and Scott, along the south eastern border with Illinois, has reported 64.

Much of the country is experiencing increases in pertussis, or whooping cough so far this year [2012] and the Northwest of the country has been hit exceptionally hard.

In Oregon, health officials reported that as of 29 May 2012, there have been 294 reported pertussis cases. This number dwarfs the 112 cases reported during the same timeframe in 2011.

The Oregon Health Authority says the ages of 2012 pertussis cases range from 8 days to 58 years; the median age is 8 years. There have been 11 infants hospitalized; 10 are 3 months old or younger.

Johnson County, Kansas is in the midst of a whooping cough outbreak. It's not as bad as in Washington State, where they've declared an epidemic of the disease, also known as pertussis. But health workers and schools in the region have been taking extra steps to get a handle on the disease.

Nancy Tausz, a disease specialist with the county, says the outbreak surfaced in mid-April 2012. "With that many cases come in, and continually, you know something other than just the norm is happening," Tausz says. The county is now investigating more than 130 cases of the disease. Tausz says at first, it was concentrated in the southern part of the county. "The ages we saw at the beginning were 5th grade and 6th grade," Tausz says. "And then started expanding from 5th grade to 8th grade."
