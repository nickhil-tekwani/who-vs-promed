The deadly Ebola hemorrhagic fever has broken out in the central Ugandan district of Luwero about one month after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the East African country free of the disease.

Joaquim Saweka, the WHO country representative told Xinhua by telephone on Wednesday [14 Nov 2012] that the outbreak was confirmed on Tuesday [13 Nov 2012] following laboratory tests that turned out positive for the disease. "Yes, that is true; we have dispatched one team to make preliminary assessments and also set up an isolation unit," he said.

The epicenter of the outbreak is in Sombwe Parish, Nyimbwa Sub County, Luwero district, which is located about 40 km north of the capital Kampala. Joseph Okware, the Luwero district health officer, was quoted by Daily Monitor on Wednesday [13 Nov 2012] as saying that 2 people belonging to the same family had died of the disease over the weekend.

The outbreak comes at a time when the country is still experiencing the deadly Marburg fever in several parts of western Uganda. In July this year [2012], the Ebola outbreak in the mid-western Ugandan district of Kibaale left at least 20 people dead.

Ebola victims present with symptoms like fever, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, measles-like rash, red eyes, and sometimes with bleeding from body openings.

Two people have died of Ebola [virus disease infection] in a fresh outbreak in Luweero District in Uganda, health officials reported on Wednesday [Wed 14 Nov 2012]. The officials said 2 other deaths in the same district were suspected to have been caused by the Ebola virus infection.

This outbreak comes only about a month after Uganda was declare Ebola-free. The Luweero district health officer, Dr Joseph Okware, said blood samples of the deceased that were tested at the Central Public Health Laboratory confirmed that the 2 had died of Ebola virus disease of the Sudan strain. The deceased were members of the same family in Nyimbwa sub-county of Luweero District. Another 2 people also died mysteriously, but the tests done were for Marburg virus infection with negative results, Dr Okware said. He added that the ministry had dispatched another team of experts to the affected area to carry out more investigations. However, Dr Asuman Lukwago, the Health Ministry permanent secretary, said they were treating the reported outbreak as an extension of haemorrhagic fevers that could be caused by either Ebola from Kibaale or by Marburg from Kabale, Ibanda and Kabalore districts, which have been under surveillance following recent outbreaks.

Uganda was still experiencing Marburg virus disease outbreaks in several areas in the west after Ebola was contained in Kibaale District, [an outbreak that caused] the deaths of at least 20 people.

[The location of Luwero District can be found in the map of the Districts of Uganda at http://www.weinformers.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Map-of-Uganda2.jpg.

Kibaale District, where the previous outbreak of Ebola virus disease this year (2012) occurred, lies to the west of Luwero District. The 2 Districts are about 100 km apart at their nearest points. Neither district is adjacent to Kabale district, the location of the current unresolved outbreak of Marburg virus disease. The majority of the victims in the Marburg virus outbreak in Kabale appeared to have been members of the same family. The same may be true in the new outbreak of Ebola virus disease in Luwero district, where the 1st 2 victims are reported to be members of the same family.

The almost simultaneous occurrence of diseases caused by different filoviruses in central Uganda suggests that some common environmental source or ecological factor may be facilitating exposure of the population to filovirus infections. Further developments are awaited. - Mod.CP
