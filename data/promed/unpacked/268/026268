Tropical diseases: the 2nd case of West Nile in Emilia-Romagna
--------------------------------------------------------------
After Chikungunya cases last year [2008] now comes
meningoencephalitis. It is not an emergency but the Region "monitors."

There are new cases of West Nile in Emilia-Romagna. The diagnosis of
West Nile meningoencephalitis in a man living in Ferrara has been
confirmed by the regional microbiological emergency reference center
(Crrem) of the Polyclinic S. Orsola-Malpighi in Bologna. The man is
currently hospitalized in the Resuscitation Department of the
Hospital of Ferrara.

This is the 2nd [human] case within a few days in Emilia-Romagna
after one found in Imolese. The province of Ferrara, already included
in the national plan for control of the virus (which is transmitted
by mosquitoes, primarily of the _Culex_ genus), is involved in the
monitoring plan implemented by the region since 23 Sep [2007].

According to the regional plan, extraordinary pest interventions were
prepared for the province and veterinary supervision will continue
[as well as] the human and entomological services provided by the Usl
Hospital organization and the University's Istituto Zooprofilattico
Experimental.

To date, all communities in the province of Ferrara have completed
the control measures against adult insects and larvae and are
finalizing them at this time. As of 16 Sep [2008], in the region
where the 1st cases of infection in wild birds and horses emerged in
Ferrara, the surveillance system has been on alert.

The regional Health Department pointed out that there is no risk of
[human-to-human] [West Nile virus] transmission [because of the] low
levels of viremia in infected, [humans] and horses, so it is
impossible for them to transmit the virus to other mosquitoes and
then on to people.

Protection from mosquito bites remains the fundamental measure to
prevent the risk of infection.

[These are the 1st human cases in an area where West Nile virus (WNV)
infections have occurred a few days earlier in horses and wild birds.
One hopes that the mosquito WNV vector control measures being
implemented, along with the onset of cooler weather, will bring this
focal outbreak to a halt.
