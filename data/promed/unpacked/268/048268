----------------------------------------------------------------
This apparently unique condition was first seen in Scotland. I saw the 1st cases and initiated the research, which was then taken up by Dr Bryn Tennant of SAC [Scottish Agricultural College] and Dr Luisa de Risio of AHT [Animal Health Trust] Newmarket, and Dr Kaspar Mattiasek and others. The newspaper article is better understood if you look at the research paper that the newspaper article is based on. This can be found in De Risio et al, Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery dated 11 Jan 2012. The paper describes why this condition may well be a previously undescribed condition [see commentary].

Speaking personally as a clinician there was an electrifying moment over 10 years ago when it dawned on me that this was a very peculiar and possibly novel condition. The history and clinical presentation is usually so clear once you have seen a few cases: such that in one case I was able to inform a vet who had a cat with this condition how it would behave. She wondered how anyone could know without seeing the animal. The research then carried out was performed on a shoe string and, again speaking personally, I think the story of how the research was done over a decade or more and the good will shown by all involved at all levels of the veterinary profession -- clinician, local lab, university referral centre, research scientist, etc -- is an excellent example of why the veterinary profession is at its best one of the great professions. One of the main aims of the research was to discount all the known causes of disease and to try to assess if the disease was in epidemiological terms confined to Scotland.

It is also worthy of note that many of the owners took a very positive approach to the research work in the hope that one day enough would be found out to reduce the risk to other cats. Thankfully it is a rare condition.

Vets [in Scotland] have been trying to explain strange symptoms in 21 cats that arrived at Strathbogie Veterinary Centre, Huntly, and Morven Veterinary Practice, Alford, both in north east Scotland, between 2001 and 2010.

The animals appeared to have a slowly progressing neurological disease. Walking with an odd gait with stiff, extended tails, the cats -- dubbed robotic cats due to their movements -- presented a veterinary oddity not seen before. Cats with a slightly different but possibly related condition have been spotted in Sweden and Austria, where it was referred to as "staggering disease". Histological tests suggested a central nervous system infection, lymphohistiocytic meningoencephalomyelitis, could be the cause.

The cats had outdoor access and lived in the same geographical rural area. When the vets looked at immune system markers they found a significant expression of the interferon-inducible Mx protein, a sign of an as yet unidentified infective or environmental immunogenic trigger for the illness.

"All the cats included in our study, and most of the cats reported with 'staggering disease', belong to the rural population accustomed to hunting birds and rodents," says one of the study's authors, Luisa De Risio. "It can be speculated that the aetiological agent may be transmitted from these animals to cats."

The authors conclude that the late onset age of this disease, its slow progression, peculiar clinical signs, and the data from the tests suggest these cats were affected by the same unique, previously unreported condition.

Abstract
--------
"Twenty-one cats presented with a history of slowly progressive neurological signs characterised by a stiff extended tail, behavioural changes, and spastic and ataxic gait. All cats had outdoor access and lived in the same geographical rural area in north east Scotland. Histological findings were consistent with lymphohistiocytic meningoencephalomyelitis. Immunohistochemistry ruled out 15 pathogens and showed a significant expression of the interferon-inducible Mx protein, suggesting an as yet unidentified infective or environmental immunogenic trigger as the possible causative agent. The late age at onset (mean 9 years), the very slow progression of clinical signs (mean 11 months), and the peculiar clinical presentation (particularly the posture of the tail) have not been reported previously in cats with lymphohistiocytic meningoencephalomyelitis."

The following extract from the discussion chapter may be of interest to subscribers:

"Of the feline lymphohistiocytic meningoencephalomyelitis reported to date, the only one that has some similarities to the disease described in this study is the so called 'staggering disease' reported in Sweden and Austria. Both diseases occur sporadically in cats from specific geographical regions (north east Scotland and the areas around Lake Malaren in central Sweden, as well as a region north east of Vienna, respectively). All the cats included in our study, and most of the cats reported with 'staggering disease', belong to the rural population accustomed to hunting birds and rodents.

"Therefore, it can be speculated that the aetiological agent may be transmitted from these animals to cats. Classical BDV [Borna disease virus] is believed to be the cause of 'staggering disease' in the Swedish cats based on detection of BDV-specific antigens and nucleic acids in the CNS of affected cats using immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, RT-PCR, and real-time RT-PCR, and based on isolation of a supposedly feline variant of BDV from CNS tissue.

"In Austrian 'staggering disease' cases, however, demonstration of BDV in CNS samples was not successful. Low level BDV-specific antigen has also been detected from the brain of a 1-year-old Belgian cat with progressive neurological signs (very similar to those of the Swedish cats with 'staggering disease') for 4 weeks prior to euthanasia. However, viral RNA was not detected in the CNS of this Belgian cat. BDV infection has been reported in cats with and without neurological signs worldwide although, a direct aetiological role of BDV in cats with neurological signs has not been established.

"BDV was not detected in any of the investigated cats included in our study by means of serology (one cat), CSF PCR (one cat), and immunohistochemistry (10 cats). The antisera we used for immunodetection were directed at viral nucleoprotein p40 and phosphoprotein p24, which are common target antigens for diagnosis of BDV in horses and cats.

"In many cats affected by 'staggering disease', an aetiological diagnosis has not been achieved. It has been speculated that virus persistence in cats with Borna disease-like meningoencephalitis is associated with loss of antigenicity and, therefore, negative immunodetection. Hence, there is controversy on the diagnosis and relative significance of BDV infection in animals. Detection in the CNS of BDV by immunohistochemistry or of BDV RNA by in situ hybridization, or both, in combination with the clinical and histological findings is considered the most reliable method of confirming BDV meningoencephalomyelitis."

For additional discussed differences between the UK cases and 'staggering disease', subscribers are referred to the full text.

The authors conclude:

"In conclusion, the late age at onset (mean 9 years), the very slow progression of signs (mean 11 months), the peculiar clinical signs (particularly the rigid extension of the tail and the spastic and ataxic gait), and, when available, the exclusion of other etiologies and the consistent histological and immunohistochemical findings suggest that the 21 cats included in this study were affected by the same unique, previously unreported condition."
