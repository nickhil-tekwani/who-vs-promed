The Personeria [legal entity] de Bogot√° warned that an outbreak in the [El Buen Pastor women's prison] associated with cases of varicella (chickenpox) was found in courtyards 2, 4, and 6, which required about 951 persons deprived of their liberty to be quarantined and, in addition, to restrict visits.

According to the complaint, the situation has been occurring since 22 May 2019, the day the 1st case of varicella was reported in courtyard 2.

Such was the emergency that on 2 Jun 2019, a child under 1 year old was also diagnosed with the disease in courtyard 6. Then, in courtyard 4, another child, 1 year and 2 months old, appeared in the same situation.

According to the Personeria, as an immediate measure of protection, 17 pregnant women were transferred to courtyard 1, because it is a high-risk population, and quarantine measures were taken in patios 2, 4, and 6, to prevent the spread of the outbreak, while the children were sent with their external caretakers.

In the face of the situation, Personeria asked the health authorities to keep the inspections and sanitary actions to face the emergency.

[With a space of 11 days between the initial 2 cases, it is certainly possible that the 2nd child was exposed to the 1st. Varicella during pregnancy is particularly dangerous in the 3rd trimester with a substantial risk of varicella pneumonia in the pregnant woman.

In addition to the risk to the mother, congenital varicella syndrome may occur most frequently when maternal disease is acquired between 8-20 week gestation. The characteristic symptoms consist of skin lesions in dermatomal distribution (76%), neurologic defects (60%), eye diseases (51%), and skeletal anomalies (49%). However, a maternal infection beginning within 5 days of delivery is associated with development of neonatal varicella with a substantial mortality rate; the high death rate likely reflects inadequate passive immunity received from the mother in the short time period before birth. - Mod.LL
