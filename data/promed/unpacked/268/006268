[2] Outbreak summaries
- Mon 21 Oct 2019. 10 new cases
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease research and Policy) edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/10/drc-sees-10-new-cases-ebola-3-days
[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

DRC sees 10 new cases of Ebola in 3 days
----------------------------------------
After recording only a handful of cases in the past 10 days, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) confirmed 10 new cases of Ebola over the weekend, including 4 today. Twelve more people have also died from the virus.

In other developments, the DRC and 9 of its neighbors at a meeting in Goma today agreed on a joint framework to work together on preparedness and response to Ebola and other disease outbreaks.

New cases from current hot spots
--------------------------------
According to the World Health Organization's (WHO) Ebola dashboard, the new cases raise the case count to 3243, including 2169 deaths. Officials are investigating 426 suspected cases.

Over the weekend [19-20 Oct 2019], the DRC's Ebola technical committee (CMRE) provided the locations of recent cases, which included one case each in Mambasa and Mabalako, and four cases in Mandima.

At least 3 of the recent deaths took place in the community in Mandima. Community deaths, as opposed to those that take place within Ebola treatment centers or hospitals, raise the risk of Ebola transmission.

Last week [week of 14 Oct 2019], the WHO said the outbreak was still a PHEIC (public health emergency of international concern), despite recent signs the 14-month-long outbreak in eastern DRC was on the retreat.

Last week, the Butembo Ebola treatment center was cleared of patients, and some health zones in Ituri, North and South Kivu provinces have gone 42 days (2 Ebola transmission cycles) without any new cases.

"This remains a dangerous and complex outbreak. We need the full force of our partners to bring the outbreak under control," WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreysus, PhD, said during a press conference on the PHEIC extension.

The disease hotspots have also migrated from bigger regional cities to more rural, remote areas. Earlier this month, Mike Ryan, MD, the WHO's executive director of health emergencies, said the rural location of the virus would mean new transmission chains could slowly but steadily produce new cases for the foreseeable future.

The CMRE said over the weekend a campaign to vaccinate taxi motorcyclists throughout the outbreak region is still ongoing. As of yesterday [20 Oct 2019], a total of 240 494 people in the DRC had been vaccinated against the virus with Merck's rVSV-ZEBOV.

Cross-border collaboration framework
------------------------------------
The event in Goma today [21 Oct 2019] was organized by the DRC, the WHO, and the African Union Commission. It was attended by health ministers and senior officials from Angola, Burundi, Central African Republic, Republic of Congo, DRC, Rwanda, South Sudan, Uganda, Tanzania, and Zambia.

According to a WHO press release, representatives are concerned about the DRC's continuing outbreak and the threat it poses to the health and economies of other countries in the region.

The member states agreed to strengthen mechanisms for the timely and accurate information on Ebola preparedness and response and other health security risks. And they noted that withholding or falsifying information on Ebola violated International Health Regulations.

Matshidiso Moeti, MBBS, the WHO's regional director for Africa, said in the statement, "Information sharing is improving, but we need to bring it to an acceptable level. We need countries to openly share information necessary to save lives. Our mission is to establish cross-border collaboration that will cover all outbreaks and all public health emergencies."

Besides agreeing on a road map for collaboration, the group also endorsed the establishment of a task force on Ebola and other disease outbreaks, which will be hosted at African Union Commission headquarters in Addis Ababa.

The framework didn't contain any funding commitments for emergency response or preparedness, but the WHO and the African Union encouraged countries to invest more in the areas.

[While Ebola activity does appear to be slowing down, as seen in this report, there will be blips when more cases are reported. This is natural as the outbreak winds down. Maintenance of the Public Health Emergency of International Concern is important, as the outbreak could regain strength at any time if patients do not report to Ebola treatment centers when ill. As stated in the Radio Okapi report below, this is a good time for the DRC and neighboring countries to come together and establish a framework to address health threats. It also is a good time to assure public health infrastructure is maintained to combat future outbreaks of Ebola and other diseases that plague the region. - Mod.LK]

- Mon 21 Oct 2019. WHO: outbreak slowing down
[Nature, abridged, edited]
https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03197-w
[Byline: Amy Maxmen]

The Ebola outbreak in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is finally waning, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on 18 Oct 2019. The good news came as a vaccine that has helped to contain the virus's spread moved a step closer to regulatory approval.

A total of 50 people were diagnosed with Ebola in the DRC between [25 Sept and 15 Oct 2019], the WHO said. At the outbreak's peak in April [2019], roughly 300 new infections were reported in 3 weeks. Since the outbreak began in August 2018, almost 3250 people have been infected and more than 2150 have died.

But the drop in infections is not a reason to relax efforts to contain the virus, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters on [18 Oct 2019]. "We must treat every case as if it is the 1st since every case has the potential to spark a new outbreak," he said.

Ebola responders have pushed the virus out of Beni, a city in the DRC's North Kivu province that has been a centre of the outbreak. But the WHO still considers the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern. Ebola is continuing to spread in remote parts of North Kivu and Ituri provinces, where violence has complicated the fight against Ebola.

An independent emergency committee of health experts that advises the WHO will convene again in 3 months to decide whether the crisis still merits the public-health-emergency designation.

There was more good news on 18 Oct 2019, when the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended that the European Commission approve an Ebola vaccine produced by the pharmaceutical company Merck.

About 240 000 people considered to be at risk from Ebola have been vaccinated with Merck's vaccine during the DRC outbreak, but the vaccine is still considered to be an experimental product by regulators worldwide and cannot be marketed. Most Ebola specialists agree that the outbreak would have been much worse without the vaccine.

The EMA will make a recommendation within 10 weeks on whether to approve the vaccine for sale. The European Commission typically follows the counsel of the EMA.

The US Food and Drug Administration fast-tracked the vaccine's application for approval in September [2019]. Its decision is expected in March 2020. As many as 7 other experimental Ebola vaccines are at earlier stages of development.

Ebola virus disease is under control, says deputy minister of health Albert Mpeti Biyombo, however he adds that the DRC needs more than the involvement of its neighbors to face these kinds of health threats.

"This is an opportunity for the DRC to formalize the framework of coordination and bilateral and multilateral collaboration with the different neighboring countries, but also to adopt the roadmaps between the DRC and its various neighboring countries", suggested Albert Mpeti Biyombo.

The Regional Director of WHO/Africa expects from this meeting, the strengthening of bilateral and multilateral relations between the DRC and its neighbors, for this specific issue. - Mod.LK]

- Fri 18 Oct 2019. WHO: PHEIC (Public Health Emergency of International Concern)
[Devex, abridged, edited]
https://www.devex.com/news/who-ebola-in-drc-still-a-global-public-health-emergency-95857
[Byline: Jenny Lei Ravelo, Sara Jerving]

The Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is still a public health emergency -- despite a decline in reported cases, the World Health Organization has announced.

The Ebola emergency committee recommended to uphold the Public Health Emergency of International Concern status for Ebola, which will extend for another three months, after a meeting on [Fri 25 Oct 2019] in Geneva. The PHEIC declaration, first made in July [2019], has become a source of ongoing debate in the global health community. Some experts expected it would inspire much-needed funding for the response, but 3 months later, the disbursement of promised dollars remains slow.

"This outbreak is like a marathon, and the last mile is always the most difficult."
-- Robert Steffen, chair of the Ebola emergency committee, World Health Organization.

There have been 15 confirmed cases of Ebola reported in North Kivu and Ituri provinces in the past week. But this encouraging trend should be interpreted with caution, said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus during a press briefing on [Fri 18 Oct 2019] following a meeting of the emergency committee, which advises the WHO chief on the Ebola outbreak. This is the 5th time the committee has convened for the outbreak in DRC.

"We must treat every case as if it's the 1st because every single case has the potential to spark a new and bigger outbreak," Tedros said, noting the risks of Ebola spreading within DRC and neighboring countries "remain very high."

The WHO chief has refrained from suggesting a timeline for when the outbreak will potentially end, stressing instead that the area remains "very volatile."

The decline in cases should push organizations to scale up their response, according to Rolland Kaya, MSF's humanitarian representative for East and Central Africa. He spoke at a separate briefing in Nairobi on [Fri 18 Oct 2019]. "It doesn't mean that it's over. It means that we have to reinforce even more our response because we have seen in the past in places where we had no cases or the cases were low, and then it came back again," Kaya said.

Recent investigation in Mandima, which has been a hot spot of Ebola virus activity, revealed the population -- including local health workers -- has a poor understanding of the disease's symptoms and transmission. Mistrust about the origins of the disease and reasons to get vaccinated abound, which may impact case reporting and response engagement, according to the WHO's latest Ebola disease outbreak update.

Less than half of respondents in the area indicated they would call a hotline if a community member was suspected of Ebola, and less than half understood the functions of different response interventions, according to the update.

Outstanding concerns
--------------------
Robert Steffen, chair of the Ebola emergency committee, raised concerns at Fri's press briefing about the inadequate funding the response has received to date, as well as security issues in the outbreak hotspots of Mandima and Mombasa.

Steffen said that the committee's recommendations have been adapted slightly to include establishing community awareness in areas where there's been no Ebola disease transmission to date. In addition, the committee recommended accelerating action for active surveillance for cases and unexplained deaths in all areas.

"The Ebola emergency committee recommended that the PHEIC be maintained because the battle is not over yet. And as it was alluded to, we must remain cautious as there might be setbacks," Steffen said. "This outbreak is like a marathon, and the last mile is always the most difficult."

But some stakeholders question what impact the PHEIC declaration has made in the current outbreak -- and what potential impact it will have as the WHO maintains this status for the next 3 months. Steffen said there had already been a decrease in cases before the PHEIC was declared last July [2019].

Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO health emergencies program, meanwhile, suggested that having the PHEIC in place hasn't helped in mobilizing necessary funding for the outbreak.

"The declaration of the PHEIC facilitated and supported governments in accelerating their preparedness activities. In that time the [Strategic Response Plan 4] calls for a USD 68 million investment, which seems like a very small investment across 9 countries for preparedness. Of that, USD 4.5 million is funded as we speak, and we're 4 months into SRP4. So to argue that the declaration of the PHEIC has in some way magically generated millions of dollars would be a massive overestimate," he said.

The response requires close to USD 400 million in funding, Ryan said. However only USD 126 million of that amount has been received to date by various agencies involved in the response. Of the USD 66 million needed for preparedness efforts in neighboring countries of DRC, USD 4.5 million has been received.

The organization is still waiting for disbursements from pledges made to the response, and is in regular communication with the World Bank on the issue, Ryan said.

"A lot of funding has been pledged in the system and in fact, our biggest problem right now is not the pledging of money. It has been the disbursement of those funds," he said. "We've been working very closely with the World Bank and have had teleconferences with them as late as last night to look at how we can accelerate the disbursement of those funds from pledging agencies," he added.

Tedros on [Fri 18 Oct 2019] reiterated the need to invest in preparedness: "The problem here is the world responds when there is panic, and I think with the current situation, people don't see the sense of urgency. But the most worrisome part is, we are not ready as a global community, we are not ready to invest in preparedness," he said.

[3] Vaccine
- Fri 18 Oct 2019. Ebola vaccine dilution
[Science Daily from NIH/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, abridged, edited]
https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/10/191018125510.htm

Candidate Ebola vaccine still effective when highly diluted, macaque study finds. Scientists hope findings mean vaccine supplies could stretch farther.

A single dose of a highly diluted VSV-Ebola virus (EBOV) vaccine -- approximately one-millionth of what is in the vaccine being used to help control the ongoing Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) -- remains fully protective against disease in experimentally infected monkeys, according to National Institutes of Health [NIH] scientists. The NIH investigators completed the vaccine dosage study using cynomolgus macaques and an updated vaccine component to match the EBOV Makona strain that circulated in West Africa from 2014-16. The study appears in Lancet's EBioMedicine.

Nearly 250 000 people have received the investigational VSV-EBOV vaccine since August 2018 as part of a "ring vaccination" program to help stem the outbreak. The vaccine appears to be safe and highly effective. The manufacturer has announced that it has submitted a biologics license application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. VSV-EBOV is based on a live-attenuated vesicular stomatitis virus and delivers an EBOV protein to elicit protective immune responses. With the continued need to vaccinate individuals in the DRC and surrounding countries, a potential shortage of VSV-EBOV vaccine is a concern and further dose adjustment is a possible solution.

Scientists from NIH's Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML), part of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, tested several dosage strengths, including one with 10 million plaque-forming units (PFU). They determined that a vaccine with 10 PFUs was just as effective as the highest dose tested (a dose which was still lower than the one currently in use in the DRC). They vaccinated macaques 28 days prior to infecting them with a lethal dose of EBOV and then monitored the animals for 42 days after infection. Even the macaques given the lowest dose appeared completely protected from disease due to EBOV.

The scientists say their study findings could help make more vaccine available for more people and may reduce adverse reactions to the vaccine because of the smaller amount of active ingredient. Such reactions can include injection site irritation, headache, fatigue, fever, chills, myalgia, and arthralgia. Demonstrating that the vaccine appears effective with adjusted dosing also could ease the burden on vaccine production.

The authors say that although results from preclinical and clinical studies can differ, these promising findings in macaques of complete protection with a lower-dose VSV-EBOV vaccine help support the possibility of similar clinical trials in people.

[Dilution of the Merck Ebola vaccine is similar to what was done with the Yellow fever vaccine. The WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization allowed a 5th of a standard vaccine dose which still provided protection against yellow fever for at least 12 months and possibly much longer. This fractional dosing was adopted as a short-term measure in response to concern over vaccine shortage. It was not proposed for routine immunization because of concern how long protection following the fractional dose would last relative to a full dose. - Mod.LK]

[Byline: Kate Kelland]

The world's first Ebola vaccine was recommended for approval by European drugs regulators on [Fri 18 Oct 2019] in a move hailed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a "triumph for public health" that would save many lives.

It protects against the Zaire strain of the Ebola virus - the one that most commonly causes outbreaks.

The shot is also being reviewed under a fast-track system by regulators in the United States, with a decision expected in the 1st quarter of next year [2020].

"This vaccine has already saved many lives in the current Ebola outbreak, and the decision by European regulators will help it to eventually save many more," the WHO's director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement.

The Merck vaccine, which the company has now brand-named Ervebo, is likely to get a full marketing license from the European Commission in a few weeks. Roger Perlmutter, president of Merck Research Laboratories, said the company's priority now was to get regulatory approval of its Ervebo manufacturing site in Germany so that licensed supply of the vaccine "can be used to support global public health preparedness".

Merck's vaccine is being used in DRC in a so-called "ring vaccination" approach, in which people who may have been in contact with someone newly infected with Ebola are traced and offered the shot to protect them.

Charlie Weller, head of vaccines at the Wellcome Trust global heath charity said the Merck shot had already saved "countless lives" in the country. "Having this vaccine available under research conditions has been key in preventing the ongoing outbreak in the DRC spiraling into a repeat of the 2014-16 epidemic, where 11 000 people died," she told Reuters.

Health authorities in Kinshasa said last week they planned to introduce an experimental second Ebola vaccine, developed by drugmaker Johnson & Johnson, in the country's eastern provinces in November [2019].

[Byline: Cecilia Okoth]

The establishment of the Africa Ebola Coordination Task Force (AfECT), that will be hosted at the African Union secretariat in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, was agreed upon on [Mon 21 Oct 2019] by the 9-member states during a meeting that took place in Goma, DRC.

A total of 9 African countries including Uganda have agreed to establish a joint task force to aid surveillance and the management of the Ebola virus disease (EVD)

The countries which have been on high alert since the outbreak of the disease in the DRC in August last year [2018], also agreed to step up coordination efforts. They include; Angola, Burundi, Central Africa Republic, DRC, Rwanda, South Sudan, Uganda, Tanzania, and Zambia.

The coordination efforts according to a communique signed by the 9 countries include; information sharing on potential security threats, cross border EVD case and laboratory surveillance cross border tracing and monitoring of contacts as well as workforce capacity development.

Others are; sharing of technical expertise and other resources, cross border joint planning and implementation of preparedness and response activities, movement of people across national borders in accordance with the international health regulations and legal and regulatory processes for cross border deployment.

The establishment of the Africa Ebola Coordination Task Force (AfECT), that will be hosted at the African Union secretariat in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, was agreed upon on [Mon 21 Oct 2019] by the nine-member states during a meeting that took place in Goma, DRC.

Health Minister Dr Jane Ruth Aceng who attended the meeting said the task force will have political oversight over outbreaks like Ebola while the World Health Organisation (WHO) will maintain the technical capacity and advise that it gives to the countries. "We embrace this aspect of having an African Ebola coordination task force so that all partners that are supporting the country that has an outbreak are well-coordinated and this will subsequently help us avoid wastage of resources," Aceng said. Although Uganda does not have Ebola currently, Aceng said the country remains alert, knowing that the disease exists in neighbouring DRC.

WHO, in its emergency committee meeting on [Fri 18 Oct 2019] in Geneva, said EVD in DRC remains an "urgent" global health emergency. As a result, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the public health emergency will be maintained for an additional three months. "This outbreak remains a complex and dangerous outbreak," he said, deploring the lack of funding.

DRC's latest Ebola epidemic, which began in August 2018, has killed 2144 people, making it the 2nd deadliest outbreak of the virus, after the West Africa pandemic of 2014--2016.

The status of a global health emergency is an exceptional measure that has been used by the WHO 4 times: in 2009 for the Swine flu virus, in 2014 for polio, in 2014 for the Ebola epidemic which killed more than 11 000 in Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone and in 2016 for the Zika virus.

- Fri 21 Oct 2019. Congo DR (Beni): attacks condemned
[Radio Okapi; in French, machine trans. edited]

The Ebola Response Support Committee (CAR) condemns attacks on health facilities and response teams last week in Lwemba in Babila-Babombi chiefdom in Mambasa territory in the province of Ituri.

Mr. Omar Kavota fears that this situation will increase the rate of contamination in the neighboring province of North Kivu where the epidemiological situation already seemed to be mastered with a significant decrease in new cases.

"At the level of the CAR, we believe that what is being observed in these days in Lwemba around Biakato may affect, if you do not pay attention, the neighboring province of North Kivu. And so we encourage communities, armed groups, young people in this part of the country to consider that we can defeat Ebola only through responsible behavior. The good practices that have been observed in Mangina, Beni and Katwa have led today to significantly reduce the rate of Ebola contamination", said Omar Kavota.

He calls the inhabitants of Mangina to more responsibility.

Abstract. The ongoing Ebola virus disease epidemic (August 2018 -- October 2019) in the DRC, has been exacerbated by deliberate attacks on healthcare workers despite vaccination efforts. Using a mathematical/statistical modeling framework, we present the quantified effective reproduction number (Rt) at national and regional levels as at 29 Sep 2019. The weekly trend in Rt displays fluctuations while our recent national-level Rt falls slightly above 1.0 with substantial uncertainty, which suggests improvements in epidemic control.
