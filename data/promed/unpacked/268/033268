On 30 Dec 2021, Rainbow Equine Laboratory reported a case of EI [Equine Influenza] in an unvaccinated non-Thoroughbred gelding on a premises in North Yorkshire. The animal came from Ireland on 17 Dec 2021, was noted unwell on arrival and developed clinical signs including pyrexia, cough and nasal discharge in the following few days.

There are 15 vaccinated in-contacts on the premises and they do not currently have any signs of disease. The case has been isolated and biosecurity measures are being implemented. The positive diagnosis was confirmed by PCR on pooled nasopharyngeal swabs taken on 23 and 29 Dec 2021.

[Equine influenza is an acute respiratory infection of horses, donkeys, mules, and zebras caused by 2 distinct subtypes (H7N7, formerly equi-1, and H3N8, formerly equi-2) of influenza A virus within the genus _Influenzavirus A_ of the family Orthomyxoviridae. Viruses of the H7N7 subtype have not been isolated since the late 1970s.

While EI virus (EIV) has not been shown to cause disease in humans, serological evidence of infection has been described primarily in individuals with an occupational exposure to the virus.

In view of the very high infectiousness of EIV, contacts of an infected animal should be immediately traced back, isolated, and tested.

For further information on EI, please refer to Mod.TG's commentary at https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=8199359. - Mod.AS
