Since the beginning of 2005 more than 100 cases of
hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) have been
reported in the Mariy El Republic, according to the Regional
Office of the Russian (Health) Protection Agency
[Rospotrebnadzor]. The Agency stated that this is a very
high figure for the region. The rapid dissemination of the
illness is associated with expansion of the vole population
in response to an abundance of forage and favorable
environmental and climatic conditions.
Small rodents in rural areas are not usually trapped and
eradicated, since the majority of the population is unaware
of the risk associated with an abundance of these animals.
The people at greatest risk of infection tend to be those
working in the fields and forestry workers. But others at
home, in industrial premises or in summer residences can
become infected.
No vaccine is available against HFRS and therefore medical
assistance should be sought at the 1st signs of illness
(high temperature, headache and thirst). Physicians consider
that strict observance of personal hygiene is best
protection against infection.

[The Mariy El Republic is located in the eastern part of the
European plain, along the course of the River Volga. In the
north, north east, and the east the Republic is bounded by
the Kirov region, in the south east and the south by the
Republics of Tatarstan and Chuvashia, and in the west and
north west by the Nizhniy Novgorod region. The population of
the Republic is 728 000 (2004 census). The total area is 232
000 sq km. The Mariy El Republic is part of Privolzhskiy
Federal District (Okrug).
HFRS morbidity in Russia in 2004 was 7.08 per 100 000
inhabitants, whereas in 2003 it was 4.3. The highest number
of HFRS cases in 2004 was recorded in the Privolzhskiy
Federal District -- 28.2 per 100 000 inhabitants, 4 times
the average for Russia as a whole. In 2004 in Mariy El HFRS
morbidity was 53.2 per 100 000 inhabitants. (These data are
taken from the state report "Concerning the sanitary and
epidemiological situation in the Russian Federation in 2004"
(<http://www.gsen.ru/doc/gosdoclad/report2004.pdf>).
In total 387 cases of HFRS, 4 of which had a fatal outcome,
were recorded in Mariy El in 2004
