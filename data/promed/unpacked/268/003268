[1] DRC: measles vaccination campaign
Date: Fri 12 Jul 2019
Source: The Guardian [edited]
https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/jul/12/measles-vaccination-begins-in-ebola-hit-congo-amid-fears-of-massive-loss-of-life


Health workers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo [DRC] have launched an urgent measles vaccination campaign in Ebola-hit regions, after almost 2000 deaths from the preventable disease, 2/3 of them among children under 5.

At least 1981 people died from measles in DRC this year [2019], surpassing the 1641 deaths from Ebola, according to the UN children's agency, UNICEF. The "unprecedented" humanitarian crisis is putting the health system under strain, UN staff said.

"The combined threat of Ebola and measles for the thousands of families living in overcrowded and unsanitary displacement camps is unprecedented," said Edouard Beigbeder, a UNICEF DRC spokesman. "We have a small window to prevent a potentially massive loss of life."
Nearly 115 000 cases of suspected measles have been reported for the 6 months to 23 Jun [2019], almost double the number recorded for the whole of 2018.

"Cases of measles have accelerated in Ituri in the past year, mainly due to fighting and mass displacement," said Jerome Pfaffman, a UNICEF health specialist based in Bunia, a town in the northeast province. "People go into camps, which are overcrowded and unsanitary. With the Ebola outbreak, it puts the health system under a strain and poses a major challenge for government, health officials, and partners."

The measles vaccination campaign is targeting 67 000 children in Ituri, which is at the centre of the 2nd-deadliest Ebola outbreak on record. As of 8 Jul [2019], there were 2428 cases of Ebola, roughly 30% of which were among children.

Fighting has escalated in Ituri, with a massive influx of families forcibly displaced by conflict in recent weeks. An estimated 400 000 people have been displaced, the vast majority women and children.

Pfaffman said an additional 250 specially trained staff have been mobilised to tackle the outbreak in Bunia. Extra measures were needed to protect workers and patients from Ebola and to screen for it. "You have to have additional protection for frontline workers, to protect against infection, and you have to have meticulous triage," he said.

The rollout of the programme will be further complicated because some of the early symptoms of Ebola, including fever, redness around the eyes, and diarrhoea, are virtually indistinguishable from those of measles, malaria, and cholera, all of which are common in camps.

The 1st sites to be targeted for the programme are 4 displacement camps in Bunia. The boundary of one of the camps is less than 100 m [328 ft] away from an Ebola treatment centre and less than 3 km [1.9 mi] from parts of Bunia where there have been 5 Ebola cases since the outbreak began, 2 of them in the past 3 weeks.

Measles campaigns are also being planned for Tchomia and Nyankunde health zones.

Rwandan has launched a mass vaccination campaign against measles following an outbreak of the major child killer disease in the western part of the country, an official said Thursday [11 Jul 2019].

Jose Nyamusore, division manager of the Epidemic Surveillance and Response Division at Rwanda Biomedical Center, told Anadolu Agency late Thursday [11 Jul 2019] that the disease outbreak was 1st reported on 7 Jul [2019] in Ngororero district, but later more cases were reported from a nearby district of Rutsiro.

The Ministry of Health has immediately launched a vaccination drive to contain the outbreak, he said, adding that a total of 50 cases of measles have so far been confirmed in the 2 districts, but there were no fatalities.

"The vaccination campaign against measles was launched on Monday [8 Jul 2019] targeting all children under 15 years, and it is due to end on Friday [12 Jul 2019]," he said, adding that at least 80% of the children have been vaccinated so far.

Health officials in Ngororero district had put the number of targeted children for vaccination at about 70 000.

Nyamusore also appealed to parents to embrace routine vaccination for their children, saying it maximizes children protection.

The number of measles cases worldwide nearly quadrupled in the 1st quarter of 2019 to 112 163 compared to the same period last year [2018], the World Health Organization (WHO) said in April [2019].

WHO Regional Office for Africa, Weekly Bulletin on Outbreaks and Other Emergencies
Week 19: 6-12 May 2019
Data as reported 12 May 2019
14 286 cases, 139 deaths, 0.97% CFR

Event description. The measles outbreak in Chad continues to spread both geographically and numerically, with the number of reporting districts increasing until week 16 (week ending 20 Apr 2019). In week 17 (week ending 27 Apr 2019), there were 1295 suspected cases, including 20 deaths, a slight decrease on the previous week. A total of 77 districts are in epidemic phase, compared to 78 at week 16. As of 4 May 2019, there have been a total of 14 286 cases and 139 deaths (case fatality ratio 0.97%) reported in 115 (91%) out of 126 districts in the country. The deaths were reported from 36 districts. Eight districts reported more than 500 cases during the 1st 16 weeks of 2019: Am Timan (1622 cases), N'Djamena East (1025 cases), N'Djamena South (897 cases), N'Djamena Center (825 cases), Moundou (719 cases), Abeche (656 cases), Mandelia (599 cases), and Dourbali (592 cases), accounting for 49% of the caseload. Overall, 78% of cases are in children less than 9 years of age, while the average age of those affected is 6 years and the median 3 years. Of those affected, 80% have not been vaccinated.

Public health actions. A measles task force has been established, and an emergency plan is being developed. Intense measles reactive vaccination campaigns have been undertaken, and are now finished, in 10 districts, with funding from UNICEF. Free treatment of measles cases has been provided in 15 districts by Medicins Sans Frontiers (MSF) France, as well as free treatment of complicated cases in N'Djari hospital. The measles vaccination campaign in Amtiman district, funded by MSF Holland, has ended and results are expected soon. The measles vaccination coverage evaluation is ongoing in Amtiman district. Laboratory reagents for measles IgM testing arrived at N'Djamena on 24 Apr 2019.

Situation interpretation. The measles outbreak in Chad continues to be of concern, with increasing case incidence and geographical spread. Challenges include ongoing resource scarcity, including testing reagents, vaccines, and operational funds, which in turn affects the epidemiological description and understanding of the outbreak. Poor vaccine coverage complicates the situation, and recent vaccination campaigns have yet to be evaluated. Outbreak responses urgently need strengthening, with mobilization of resources by local authorities and partners in all affected areas required in order to bring this outbreak to a close.

[5] Nigeria: WHO recommendation for travelers
Date: Fri 12 Jul 2019
Source: WHO ReliefWeb [abridged, edited]
https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/who-advice-international-travel-relation-measles


WHO advice for international travel in relation to measles
Report from government of Nigeria
-----------------------------
Measles is one of the world's most contagious diseases, with the potential to be extremely severe. In 2017, the most recent year for which estimates are available, measles caused approximately 110 000 deaths. Even in high-income countries, complications result in hospitalization in up to a quarter of cases and can lead to lifelong disability, from brain damage and blindness to hearing loss.

The best protection against the disease is through receiving 2 doses of the measles vaccine, which is often incorporated with mumps and/or rubella vaccines.

Most measles-related deaths are caused by complications associated with the disease, which include blindness, encephalitis (an infection that causes brain swelling), severe diarrhoea and related dehydration, ear infections, or respiratory infections such as pneumonia.

Risk of infection for international travellers
------------------------
Over recent months, spikes in case numbers have occurred including in countries with high overall vaccination coverage as the disease has spread fast among clusters of unvaccinated people.

Travel-related recommendations to prevent the international spread of measles
--------------------------
- Recent outbreaks of measles highlight gaps in protection against the disease among children and adults. All travellers should check that their vaccination status is up-to-date and ensure that they have received 2 doses of measles vaccine.
- Travellers who are uncertain of their measles vaccination status should receive at least one dose of measles vaccine. WHO recommends that travellers get vaccinated against measles at least 15 days prior to travel.
- Measles vaccine can be co-administered with other vaccines recommended for travellers such as yellow fever vaccine.
- WHO recommends that infants from 6 months of age receive a supplementary dose of measles vaccine if they are travelling to countries experiencing measles outbreaks. Children between 6 and 9 months of age who receive a supplementary dose of measles vaccine should also receive 2 doses of measles vaccine at the recommended ages according to the national immunisation schedule.
- All travellers should seek advice from their healthcare providers and be aware of the risk of exposure to measles virus as well as transmission and symptoms of the disease.
- Measles vaccines are not recommended for pregnant women.

Ohio has its 1st case of measles, in a young Stark County adult, and the state's Health Department urged parents to vaccinate against the infectious disease.

State health director Dr. Amy Acton said Friday [12 Jul 2019] the person who got sick with measles had recently traveled to a state with confirmed measles cases. The case is the 1st confirmed instances of measles in 2 years. The last outbreak of the illness in Ohio was in 2014, with 382 confirmed cases.

The nation [USA] is experiencing a major spread of measles, with 28 states reporting cases.

Hotez and colleagues' recent article highlights the increasing frequency of vaccine-preventable disease cases in Europe and the USA caused by very visible anti-vaccine movements.

The most troubling aspect of this development is the global increase in measles cases. From 1 Jan 2019-26 Apr 2019, the USA reported 704 confirmed measles cases spanning 22 states, compared with 372 reported cases in 2018, 120 in 2017, 86 in 2016, 188 in 2015, and 667 in 2014. Therefore, only 4 months into 2019, the number of cases reported is already the highest since measles was declared officially eliminated in the US in 2000.

[The correction refers to] the list of countries that pose the highest risk of measles to the USA, [which was] corrected to "Ukraine, Mexico, Cuba, Israel, Japan, Thailand, and Philippines."

[9] Vaccine hesitancy among highly educated

...The phenomenon is much more expansive than even that. In the 2017-2018 school year, 7044 kindergartners in Texas had nonmedical exemptions. There were 3344 in Washington state, 3427 in Oregon, 4753 in Michigan, and approximately 2000 in each of New Jersey and New York. But the number of unvaccinated children in the U.S., though small, has risen significantly in the past year. According to the CDC, the percentage of unvaccinated children increased from 0.8% in 2016 to 1.1% in 2017. These 3 tiny decimal points represent a huge increase to about 63 555 unvaccinated kids a year. And vaccination refusal is a contagion, like the measles. People who don't vaccinate their children tend to live among people who also don't vaccinate their children.

[The article at the source URL above is recommended reading. It helps one understand the philosophy behind the deeply felt vaccine hesitancy of educated parents. It addresses the struggle of such parents with children at Green Meadow Waldorf School, Rockland County, NY, with the court orders to vaccinate their children in response to the growing epidemic of measles in NY. Their view of vaccination with MMR vaccine is that it is introducing toxins into the pure bodies of children. This attitude is partly due to the unfounded fear of autism as well as the consequence of a very active disinformation campaign. The fear of vaccination is prevalent in orthodox religious communities as well as alternative schools such as the Waldorf school. - Mod.LK

[10] Data requested
Date: Fri 12 Jul 2019
From: Dr. Iype Joseph MBBS, MPH [edited]

It will be interesting if reports with the following data are highlighted:

1. Age data: Those with measles before the age of the 1st dose of measles (e.g., measles cases less than 9 months of age in India. The 1st measles vaccine dose is given at 9 months of age).
2. Age data: Those born before the start of measles vaccination (e.g., those born before 1985 in India).
3. Those [who have] taken vaccinations as recommended by their countries but are still getting measles.

I am part of the measles research group of my institution, RGCB [Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology], Trivandrum, Kerala, India. About 27% of our pediatric cases are below 9 months of age. No cases in the above-50-year age group. Some get measles even after getting 2 proper doses of measles vaccine on time. We have few antenatal cases too.

Disaggregated data can help us understand the situation better. The epidemiology of measles is changing. Most of our ideas related to measles developed from what was observed when it was an endemic disease in most parts of the world. The eradication dream may not be as easy as many people have imagined.
