South American country fights to keep above water
--------------------------------------------------
Guyana was born fighting against the tide. More than half its people live on
a dip of land 6 feet below sea level along the Atlantic coast. Their homes
teeter on stilts while an old sea wall keeps the high tide at bay. When it
rains, as it does often in this slice of equatorial South America, Guyanese
officials scurry to operate an intricate system of canals, dams and
floodgates that drains the water and flushes it out at low tide. It is a
high-maintenance relationship with Mother Nature, and taking it casually can
be devastating -- a lesson learned since last month, when a high lunar tide
and heavy rains combined to inundate areas occupied by nearly half the
country's 706 000 people.
It was Guyana's worst natural disaster ever. The flooding didn't get much
attention abroad, coming soon after the cataclysmic tsunami in Asia. It
didn't kill thousands or roar off the water like last year's hurricanes.
What it did was settle in, up to 6 feet high, for a long and unwelcome stay,
generating disease, ruining crops, and polluting the drinking water. It
battered an already feeble economy and strained race relations in this
perpetually divided nation.
A month after the first rains, residents along parts of the coast and up the
Mahaica River are still slogging through knee-deep water and shoe-sucking
mud. More than 20 people have died from the water-borne [bacterial infection]
leptospirosis -- also known as swamp fever -- bringing the death toll from
the deluge to 34. Although there were plenty of warnings that the vast 200-
year-old drainage system had fallen into disrepair, people didn't grasp the
scope of the problem until the torrential rains began 14 Jan 2005. Within 4
days, 25 inches fell and quickly topped canals clogged with silt and debris.
Dozens of "kokers" -- sluice gates that lift and drop like a guillotine --
were frozen shut by sediment.
"For many, many years, they totally ignored the canals," said Mike Sarhan,
Guyana director of the USA Agency for International Development, who has been
involved in the relief efforts. "Some were so filled up that people were
growing crops in them. And some of the kokers hadn't been opened up in 60
years."
The water couldn't escape, and it rose insidiously in the capital city of
Georgetown and the coastal villages. As the depth approached 5 feet in some
places, authorities scrambled to get food and drinking water to the people
affected. But their emergency management team was in disarray. The warehouse
where they stored dry rations, blankets, and medicines had been emptied when
the government helped the island of Grenada after Hurricane Ivan. The agency
had no way to deal with the disaster.

[Deaths from leptospirosis continue to increase in Guyana, and presumably
with a corresponding and much higher number of total cases. Certainly
inundating rains together with a very old and badly maintained water system
can easily facilitate the spread of leptospirosis as well as many other water-
borne infections. - Mod.LL]
