Health authorities have already reported 45 000 cases: Outpatient
ophthalmology consults have increased due to conjunctivitis virus
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The country is suffering from an epidemic of conjunctivitis, a
disease in which the national epidemiological surveillance system has
received reports on approximately 45 000 cases this year, revealed
yesterday by the undersecretary of Public Health, Nelson Rodriguez
Monegros [Thu 16 Oct 2008]. He said that last year [2007] the country
also had an epidemic of conjunctivitis following hurricanes Noewl and
Olga, but that the current number of reported cases has doubled now [in 2008].

He recalled that conjunctivitis is an inflammation of the conjunctiva
or transparent membrane that covers the whites of the eye, and that
it is highly contagious, so to prevent it, a high level of hygiene
and frequent handwashing is recommended.

"We are facing an epidemic because cases are found everywhere,
affecting whole families, and we have received reports of
approximately 45 000 cases of conjunctivitis," revealed Rodriguez
Monegro. He recalled that conjunctivitis is not a disease subjected
to mandatory reporting, so that the cases are not quantified
regularly, but given the epidemic the country is presently facing,
cases are being identified in the majority of hospitals.

He noted that under normal conditions reported cases of
conjunctivitis are not routinely quantified. He stressed that this
disease usually appears at this time of year, especially after the
country is affected by natural phenomena, such as those that have
plagued the country this year [there were 2 hurricanes that affected
the Dominican Republic this year - Mod.MPP]. He said that there is no
specific treatment for conjunctivitis, because it is caused by a
virus, but it is very highly contagious. "What people should do is
carry out hygiene measures to extremes such as hand washing, washing
the face with soap and water, not rubbing your eyes, and using towels
or personal clothswithout sharing them with other family members," he
said. Rodriguez Monegro added that the most important thing is to
personalize objects and utensils, and above all, wash one's hands,
because it is easily transmissible through that route.

He assured that the Ministry of Health is working through the
Provincial and Regional Health departments, on the education of the
population and are even developing radio spots with educational
messages. According to reports obtained by the Listin Diario, at
present conjunctivitis has resulted in increased consultations at
hospitals and clinics, while often affecting entire families, causing
work and school absenteeism. Among the symptoms of conjunctivitis are
eye redness, swollen and itchy eyelids. It is highly contagious. It
usually does not cause eye damage or visual problems in the long term.

Conjunctivitis can be caused by either a bacterial or viral
infection. The [conjunctivitis] currently affecting the population of
the Dominican Republic is of viral origin, according to ophthalmology
specialists. There is also allergic conjunctivitis.

[Most frequently, viral conjunctivitis is due to adenovirus
infection. Many serotypes may be involved. Types 3, and sometimes, 4
and 7, are responsible for pharyngoconjunctival fever --
conjunctivitis associated with upper respiratory tract infection.
Adenovirus types 8 and 19 are frequently associated with viral
keratoconjunctivitis.

Coxsackievirus A24, enterovirus 70, herpes simplex virus and
varicella-zoster virus may also cause acute haemorrhagic
conjunctivitis. Less commonly viruses such as molluscum contagiosum,
vaccinia, and human immunodeficiency virus may be responsible for
conjunctivitis. Also systemic infection with influenza virus,
Epstein-Barr virus, Newcastle disease virus, measles, rubella, and
mumps, may also cause conjunctivitis in association with upper
respiratory tract infections.

Viral conjunctivitis often occurs in the aftermath of extreme and
stressful climatic events such as hurricanes, sandstorms and the
like. Viral conjunctivitis has been a frequent accompaniment of the
hurricane season in Central America and the Caribbean. The virus
responsible for the current outbreak in the Dominican Republic is
likely to be an adenovirus or an enterovirus. Information on the
precise diagnosis would be welcomed.
