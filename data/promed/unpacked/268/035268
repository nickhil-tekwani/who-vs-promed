In a unique case of its kind, a person from the CMCH [Christian Medical College & Hospital] area "bitten by a street dog" got rabid and started running after other patients to bite them at the Civil Hospital, where he was undergoing treatment. The patient was, meanwhile, referred to Rajindra Hospital in Patiala after he was confirmed to be suffering from rabies.

Dr Avinash Jindal, specialist physician who treated the patient at Civil Hospital, said: "The patient was brought to our hospital yesterday [Fri 6 Jul 2013] to the emergency department after he got aggressive. He was 1st checked by the psychiatrist as he reported severe aggression symptoms. This morning [7 Jul 2013], while we were checking him, he got more aggressive and started running after people there. He, in fact, bit a 25-year-old patient at the hospital. When I took his history, his attendant told me that he was bitten by a stray dog about 10 days ago. Suspecting him to be suffering from hydrophobia [rabies], we did a simple test and brought water in front of the patient. He got convulsions and suffered from laryngeal spasms, thus confirming that he indeed is suffering from rabies. I later gave him antibiotics and anti-convalescents." [sic, possibly a misprint for anticonvulsants -- Mod.JW] [Rabies is a virus infection and unlikely to respond to treatment with antibiotics, and less so to "anti-convalescents". - Mod.CP]

[This press report bears close similarities to a report from Ujjain [Madhya Pradesh state] reproduced previously in ProMED-mail (Rabies - India (06): (MP) canine, human-to-human transmission susp. 20130706.1810755).

Both reports describe victims exhibiting rabies-like symptoms following a dog bite and in turn transmitting rabies by bite to other human victims. Neither incident has been corroborated independently. Likewise, rabies virus infection has not been confirmed by laboratory diagnostics in the case of either of the dogs responsible for the initial bites, or the initial human victims, or the hospitalised patients reputed to have been bitten by the supposedly rabid humans. Transmission of rabies from one human to another by bite, although not impossible, is unlikely, and, according to the US CDC, has not happened (http://www.cdc.gov/rabies/transmission/exposure.html).

Ludhiana is a city and a municipal corporation in Ludhiana district in the Indian state of Punjab. It is the largest city in the state, with an estimated population of 1 613 878 as per census 2011. The population increases substantially during the harvesting season due to the migration of labourers from eastern states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha and Delhi. It has an area of about 3787 square km. - Mod.CP
