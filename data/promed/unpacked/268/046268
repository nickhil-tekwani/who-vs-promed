Search for passengers exposed to measles
----------------------------------------
A hunt is on to find around 30 passengers who may have been exposed to
measles after sitting near a baby with the disease on a recent flight from
Auckland to Christchurch. Canterbury medical officer of health, Dr Ramon
Pink, said the 11 month old was on flight NZ509 on 7 Dec 2009.

"Passengers sitting in rows 13-17 of the Air New Zealand flight which
arrived in Christchurch from Auckland at 3.45pm on Monday (7 Dec 2009) may
have been exposed to the highly infectious disease," Dr Pink said. People
sitting in these rows should contact their doctor or call Community and
Public Health on (03) 364 1777 if they had had symptoms. "Anyone sitting in
these rows is also urged to stay away from pre-schools or other places
where young children gather for the next 12 days." The baby had transferred
to the Christchurch flight after landing in Auckland from London.

Measles was spread by breathing, coughing, and sneezing, and could cause a
rash, high fever, runny nose and sore, watery eyes. Occasionally it can be
fatal. The measles incubation period is up to 21 days, Dr Pink said.

[The risk of transmission of measles from an 11 month old baby to airline
passengers in adjacent seats during a short duration flight within New
Zealand must be low, particularly as most adult passengers will have
immunity to measles virus infection. It will be interesting to learn
whether there is any response to this alert. At greater risk would be
passengers on the intercontinental flight from Europe, who are not being
warned.
