On 9 Jul 2006, local public health authorities became aware of an increase
[in the incidence of] influenza-like illness in people who worked at a meat
processing plant where cattle and sheep were slaughtered and meat packaged,
in the town of Bridge of Allan in central Scotland (1).
An investigation was initiated and, by 14 Jul 2006, 49 members of the
staff, out of a workforce of 228, had been identified as having fallen ill
predominantly with 2 or more of the following symptoms: fever, headache,
myalgia, dry cough and joint pain. All those with symptoms were screened
for a range of pathogens and results from blood samples tested at the West
of Scotland Specialist Virology Centre confirmed the illness as Q fever.
Since then an epidemiological investigation has been undertaken including
screening of all staff working at the plant. 9 patients had been admitted
to hospital by 18 Jul 2006. By 4 Aug 2006, 51 cases for which the initial
IgM result was greater or equal to 256 had been identified. The
investigation continues.
There is a risk of contracting Q fever by airborne spread especially within
a half-mile radius of a source. The plant is not situated near to
residential buildings, but is close to a road with much vehicular traffic.
Enhanced surveillance was begun to identify cases in the surrounding
communities. All public health authorities in the country were alerted. So
far no cases have been identified in individuals who do not work at the
plant. Control measures including shutting down of the putative source and
cleaning and disinfection have been put in place.
Q fever is an uncommon zoonotic infection caused by an organism called
_Coxiella burnetii_. In the United Kingdom (UK), the organism is most
commonly found in infected farm animals, especially sheep, cattle and
goats, it may also be found in cats and wild animal species such as birds,
rodents or bats; in some countries it is also carried by ticks.
Transmission of _C. burnetii_ to humans occurs primarily through inhalation
of aerosols or dust contaminated with feces or urine, or from direct
contact with infected animals or their products of conception, or at
slaughter. It may also be acquired from drinking unpasteurized milk. It is
extremely rare for the infection to be passed from person to person. The
infective dose can be as low as 1 organism, and so large outbreaks can be
caused by a small source. _C. burnetii_ can survive for many years as a
spore-like form before being inhaled and causing infection.
Human infection is divided into acute and chronic Q fever, although several
distinct syndromes have been described. Usually symptoms occur 2 or 3 weeks
after exposure (range 9-40 days) and illness is typically self-limiting and
influenza-like. Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle pains, fatigue,
dry cough and pneumonia. Q fever is diagnosed by a blood test but a
positive result is obtained [not until] 2 to 4 weeks after onset of the
illness.
Full recovery usually occurs, even without treatment, but in some cases
symptoms can be serious or prolonged, especially with pneumonia or
pre-existing valvular disease, and may require hospital admission. Acute Q
fever is treatable with antibiotics. The chronic Q fever form, particularly
endocarditis, is a more serious complication and occurs in about 10 percent
of cases. It may not appear until several years after the primary episode.
In the UK, most Q fever cases are sporadic or associated with exposure to
farm animals or occur in areas (such as slaughterhouses) where animals are
handled. Retrospective serological studies have shown evidence of extensive
infection in high-risk populations, which suggests that many cases are
often not identified at the time of illness (2). Q fever is not uncommon
and seroprevalence studies indicate that approximately 27 percent of
farmers and 10 percent of the general population in the UK have been
exposed to _C. burnetii_ at some time. Being present at calving and
handling cattle products of parturition may pose significant risks, as high
concentrations of the organism are found in the placenta and birth fluids.
Animal infection is most commonly reported in ruminants and studies in
England and Wales have suggested that infection [rates] may be as high as
20 percent (3). Although heavy infections in sheep have also been
associated with abortions, it is not generally considered to be pathogenic
in animals. Q fever is rarely recorded as a cause of bovine abortion and
disease although 1.6-6.3 percent of ewes in England are seropositive, with
over 30 percent of ewes positive in some flocks (4).
Outbreaks are frequently reported worldwide, but sources of infection in
sporadic cases are often difficult to elucidate. There were 2
laboratory-confirmed cases of Q fever reported in Scotland in 2005. This
