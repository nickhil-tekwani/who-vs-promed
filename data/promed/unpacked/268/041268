Rio Grande do Sul records deaths of monkeys from yellow fever
-------------------------------------------------------------
The Institute Evandro Chagas in Belem (Para state), confirmed [in Porto
Alegre, RS] on Tuesday [9 Nov 2008] that the cause of death of mantled
howler monkeys [_Alouatta palliata_] found about 10 days ago at Coronel
Barros, in north western Rio Grande do Sul state, was yellow fever [YF
virus]. The 17th Regional Health Coordination unit, established in Ijui, is
intensifying vaccination of residents of 11 municipalities in the region.
According to the person responsible for the 17th Regional Health
Coordination unit, Erlon Beck, "We always start vaccinating in that town
when we find dead animals. With the confirmation of the cause of death by
yellow fever of mantled howler monkeys, we are increasing the immunization
of people for the neighboring counties also," said Beck. On Monday [8 Dec
2008], 12 other mantled howler monkeys were found dead in Bossoroca, in the
north west of the state. It is suspected that the cause was also yellow fever.

In the beginning of this year [2008] an outbreak of jungle yellow fever
left 40 people ill in 10 states countrywide and caused the deaths of 21
people, according to the latest bulletin released by the Ministry of Health
in April [2008]. Most cases were recorded in Goias, where 21 people were
infected and 13 died. At that time, no cases were registered in Rio Grande
do Sul state.

[This is the 2nd recent report of YF in north western Rio Grande do Sul
state, and suggests that wandering foci of YF virus transmission is
continuing in the general area. The previous report of YF infected howler
monkeys in the area was issued by the Ministry of Health in early October
2008 (see ProMED-mail: 20081113.3577).

Howler monkey mortality is a well known indicator of the presence of the
sylvan (jungle) cycle of YF virus transmission in South America.
Maintenance of an immunized human population in these areas is critical to
prevent spillover of the virus into urban and suburban areas where the
competent mosquito YF virus vector _Aedes aegypti_ is abundant, and a
significant proportion of the human population is unvaccinated.
