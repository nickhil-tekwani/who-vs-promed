The 3 probable cases of infection due to [a] hantavirus, including a death, have been reported in the district from Kallara, Nedumangad area [Kerala state], giving rise to fears that this could be another emerging virus that the State's public health system is ill-equipped to handle.

All 3 cases have tested positive for scrub typhus too. This is not the 1st time that suspected hantavirus cases are being reported in Kerala, the earliest one being reported in 2002 from Ernakulam. Despite serological evidence from the population in many parts of the country, there is yet to be any confirmatory evidence because reliable test kits are not available here, microbiologists say.

The 3 blood samples which tested positive for both hantavirus and scrub typhus were part of the bunch of samples referred to the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology (RGCB) from the Medical College Hospital to test for scrub typhus between December 2013 and early January this year [2014].

"We found some 272 blood samples to be positive for scrub typhus. We tested these samples for hantavirus also as rodents or bandicoots are a common host for both these pathogens. Once we found the 3 samples IgM positive for hanta[virus antibodies], we asked for a 2nd sample from the patients, to be collected after 7-20 days, which showed that antibody levels were going up. We can only say that this is a probable hantavirus infection, because PCR testing and gene sequencing alone will confirm the diagnosis," Head of Laboratory Medicine, RGCB, R. Radhakrishnan, says.

RGCB has already placed orders for the specific reagents and primers needed for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for hantaviruses, he says. From the clinician's point of view, all the patients had severe pulmonary and renal infection, pointing to classical symptoms of [a] hantavirus infection. Additional Director of Public Health A.S. Pradeepkumar says these symptoms are the same for scrub typhus and leptospirosis also.

[The investigators are quite correct that if a hantavirus is involved in the hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) described, virus isolation, or demonstration of hantavirus sequences by PCR, will be necessary to establish the cause of the infections. In Asia, there are 5 recognized hantaviruses with their main rodent reservoir species including: Hantaan virus (_Apodemus agrarius_), Amur virus (_A. peninsulae_), Thailand virus (_Bandicota indica_), Seoul virus (widely distributed worldwide in _Rattus norvegicus_), and Muju virus (_Myodes regulus_). One hopes that follow-up studies are done to better define the incidence of HFRS cases and identify the rodents that are the source of the infection.

The most recent cases of suspected hantavirus infections occurred in October 2011, when there were 3 cases of a suspected hantavirus infection in Nellore, Andhra Pradesh state. The specific hantavirus involved in these cases was not stated.

In a 4 Feb 2010 ProMED-mail post (archive no. 20100205.0385), it was reported that Dr J. Clement and colleagues of the National Reference Laboratory for Hantavirus Infections, University Hospital Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium, found evidence in India of the murine Seoul virus (SEOV) infection, and also of the arvicoline Puumala virus (PUUV) infection, the latter in 2 fatal cases (from the Cochin, respectively Chennai region) with acute respiratory syndrome -- symptoms similar to those in the more recently described Nellore cases in 2011 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20111026.3187) as well as in the case described above.
