The FDA today, 13 Feb 2006, delivered a letter to Cytosol Laboratories, Inc.,
of Braintree, MA, to request a recall of all brands and sizes of Balanced Salt
Solution that the firm manufactures. Balanced salt solution is a
solution used by health professionals to irrigate a patient's eyes,
ears, nose and/or throat during a variety of surgical procedures
including cataract surgery.

FDA requested the recall because product lots were found to have elevated
levels of endotoxin. Endotoxins, also known as pyrogens, are substances found
in certain bacteria that cause a wide variety of serious reactions such as
fever, shock, changes in blood pressure and in other circulatory functions.
FDA has received reports of a serious and potentially irreversible eye injury
called Toxic Anterior Segment Syndrome (TASS) which occurs when a contaminant,
such as endotoxin, enters the anterior segment of the eye during surgery and
causes an inflammatory reaction. FDA has also received complaints relating to
injuries in over 300 patients who were given balanced salt solution
manufactured by Cytosol Laboratories, Inc.

The FDA requests that the company take immediate action to retrieve all
inventories of the product, including any existing stock at physician offices
and hospitals. An FDA-requested recall is initiated to protect the public
health when a product that has been distributed represents a risk of illness
or injury and the firm has not initiated a recall of the product. FDA is
instructing hospitals, physicians, and consumers to immediately stop using any
of these products, quarantine any remaining product, and if no return
instructions from Cytosol are received, destroy the product.

An estimated 1 million units of balanced salt solution products were
distributed between Dec 2003 and Dec 2005. The balanced salt solution
products subject to the recall order were manufactured by Cytosol
Laboratories, Inc. for distribution under 3 labels:

"AMO Endosol" distributed by Advanced Medical Optics, Inc. (AMO), Santa Ana,
Calif.;

"Cytosol Ophthalmics" distributed by Cytosol Ophthalmics, Lenoir, NC; and

"Akorn" distributed by Akorn, Inc., Buffalo Grove, Ill.

[Toxin anterior segment syndrome is not an entity previously discussed on
ProMED. The following is a discussion on TASS and its differentiation from
infectious endopthalmitis:
<http://www.aao.org/aao/news/eyenet/cataract/cataract_nov.htm>:

It is important to differentiate TASS from true infectious endophthalmitis,
because the treatments are completely different -- and the treatment for one
isn't appropriate for the other. Symptoms for the 2 conditions may overlap,
making diagnosis difficult. In fact, surgeons often initially treat TASS as
infectious endophthalmitis. Here are some pointers for separating the 2:

-Early onset: TASS usually is seen soon after surgery -- later the same day or
the next. Infectious endophthalmitis, in contrast, most commonly shows up 3 to
4 days postoperatively.

- Corneal edema: with TASS, patients complain of pain and blurred vision, and
the biggest hallmark is profound limbus-to-limbus corneal edema. The limbus
is the edge between the cornea and the sclera (the white part of the eye).
Some edema will occur with endophthalmitis, but typically not diffuse limbus-
to-limbus corneal edema. Edema after surgery is specific to areas of trauma,
so it tends to be near the wound or opposite the wound, but some areas are not
affected; not so with TASS.

- Inflammation: on ophthalmological examination, TASS patients have a marked
increase in inflammation in the anterior segment. An increased in the number
of white blood cells and sometimes even a hypopyon (pus on the anterior
chamber of the eye between the cornea and the iris) can be seen.

- Fixed pupil: TASS impairs the iris sphincter function, and the pupil tends
to be fairly dilated and does not react well to light.

- High intraorbital pressure (IOP): TASS also affects the trabecular meshwork,
a network of fibers involved in the drainage of the aqueous humor of the eye
and located at the iridocorneal angle between the anterior chamber of the eye
and the venous sinus of the sclera. In endophthalmitis, IOP usually is not
elevated. A pressure of 40-70 mmHg is much more likely with TASS.

In a toxic reaction such as TASS, the inflammation will stabilize or even get
slightly better a few hours later. If it is infectious, signs will get a
little worse. If any hint that an infectious process is occurring early,
vitreous fluid aspiration and culture should be immediately done and
antibiotics begun. If it is TASS, the patient should be treated with a
topical corticosteroid every hour and a nonsteroidal 4 times a day.

At 1 to 3 weeks, TASS may still appear inflamed, but the eye still may recover
nicely if treated properly. If it still looks significantly inflamed at 6
weeks, however, further improvement is not likely to occur.

Severe TASS can cause substantial damage such as permanent damage to the
corneal endothelium; profound cystoid nonresolving macular edema; a
permanently dilated fixed pupil; and permanent damage to the trabecular
meshwork, leading to resistant glaucoma that requires multiple surgical
procedures. Milder cases of TASS get better in a couple of weeks without
treatment, so it is likely that cases are missed. - Mod.LL]
