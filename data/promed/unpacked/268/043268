[Mahmoud Orabi is thanked for submitting this report.

Little information is provided about the circumstances under which this hospitalized case acquired his hantavirus infection. Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved in this case. The locality where the young man acquired his hantavirus infection is Chubut province, located in the foothills of the Andes Mountains.

The most likely virus involved in this case is Andes virus; found in western Argentina in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_. This virus can also be transmitted directly between people in close physical contact. The above report does not indicate if the patient is suffering respiratory symptoms but since he is in the intensive care unit his condition must be serious.

Andes virus infections can result in hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome, which can rapidly become very serious and fatal. There is always the possibility of infection with Seoul hantavirus that is widely distributed in the world in brown rats (_Rattus norvegicus_). - Mod.TY
