This is to inform you that a 2nd case of chronic wasting disease (CWD) has now been detected in Sweden. As in the 1st case, it was a 16-year-old female free-ranging moose (_Alces alces_) in Norrbotten County. The moose was euthanised after being observed emaciated and with behavioural changes. The distance between the places where the 2 cases were found is around 70 km (43.5 mi).

Samples from the moose were analysed at the National Veterinary Institute (SVA) within the ongoing CWD surveillance programme. Brainstem and retropharyngeal lymph nodes were screened with a TSE rapid test (Biorad TeSeE ELISA). Samples from brainstem were positive in the screening test and were confirmed positive for transmissible spongiform encephalopathy with Western blot (BioRad TeSeE). Samples from lymph nodes were negative in the screening test.

Just like the 1st Swedish case detected in March 2019, this new case shows similar features to cases of atypical CWD previously detected in Norwegian moose [Prisinu et al. Novel type of chronic wasting disease detected in moose (_Alces alces_), Norway. Emerg Infect Dis 2018;24:2210-8], in that it was an old moose, and only brain (but not lymph nodes) was positive. However, further analyses (e.g., discriminatory Western blot and immunohistochemistry) are needed to determine the type of CWD. Such investigations will be done in collaboration with international reference laboratories for CWD.

In the article by Prisinu et al., it is hypothesised the atypical CWD described in older moose may not be contagious but rather a sporadic variant of CWD occurring in old animals. The region where these cases were found is a region of Sweden where the proportion of old females is comparatively high due to the wildlife management regime in place (16 years is approaching the expected lifespan of moose in the area). Increased surveillance and sampling in the area are now planned to gain more understanding of the nature of these cases.

[I would like to thank Dr. Lindberg for her excellent reporting regarding the 2nd CWD case in Sweden.

While reading her report, I was struck by the issue of CWD in aged moose but not, thus far, in healthy younger animals. It made me wonder whether prions can have strains, as viruses do. All living organisms mutate, so I also wondered if this form of CWD was some type of mutation affecting older rather than younger animals?

Clearly there is still much we do not know about this disease, especially in species less commonly affected.

Dr. Lindberg, we appreciate you sharing this report with the readers of ProMED-mail. - Mod.TG
