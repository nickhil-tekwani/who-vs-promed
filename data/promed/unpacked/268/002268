2002/141 First report of _Globodera pallida_ in Hungary
-----------------------------------------------------
The NPPO [National Plant Protection Organisation] of Hungary recently
informed the EPPO Secretariat that _Globodera pallida_ [Gp] (EPPO A2
quarantine pest) was found for the first time in 2001 during inspection of
fields placed under official control because of the presence of _G.
rostochiensis_.
Cysts of Gp were found in fields of 5 growers at 3 locations of the county
of Pest (Alsonemedi, Bugyi, Nyarsapat), corresponding in total to an
infested area of 8 ha. The infested area was placed under official control.
Phytosanitary actions were taken to contain the pest according to provisions
of the Hungarian phytosanitary regulation (item 1.1.2 of the Ministerial
Decree 7/2001 (I.17) FVM), which is in compliance with the EU Council
Directive 69/465/EEC on potato cyst nematodes. National surveys will
continue in 2002.
The situation of Gp in Hungary can be described as follows: Present, found
for the first time in 2001, at 3 production sites in the county of Pest.

[Gp and _G. rostochiensis_ are believed to be native to South America. They
have since spread to other parts of the world, especially western Europe,
via infected planting material, or healthy planting material containing
nematode-infested soil. Crop losses of 50 percent or more are not unusual.
