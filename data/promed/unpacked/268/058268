5 die from food or water poisoning in Maumere
------------------------------------------
5 people died on Thursday and 16 were taken to hospital after consuming
contaminated food or water in a small eastern Indonesian island, a hospital
official said.

"The victims are from Sukun island north of Flores island and 3 of the dead
came from 1 household," said head of Maumere General Hospital, Benyamin
Boli, on Flores island.

He said 3 of those in hospital are critically ill.

"We believe that apart from eating the fish, they also drank contaminated
drinking water," Boli told AFP, adding he suspected the water was tainted
with rat poison.

The cause of the contamination was not certain. Boli said his hospital has
no facilities for laboratory tests.

Maumere detective chief Comr. Ferry Irawan said a forensic team would be
sent to the island on Friday to collect samples from the homes of the victims.

[This article does not give us any indication as to the clinical signs or
symptoms. The physician suspected water tainted with rat poison, but as
there are various types of rat poison -- anticoagulants, neurological, and
even strychnine or sodium fluoracetate -- it is difficult to know what may
have been in the food or the water, and why the physician suspects the
water. More information on this incident would be appreciated. - Mod.TG]
