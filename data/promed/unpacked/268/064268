Six tick species belonging to 3 genera were identified in the current study. Four species, i.e., _Dermacentor marginatus_ (Sulzer, 1776), _Hyalomma hussain_ (Sharif, 1928), _Hy. anatolicum_ (Koch, 1844), and _Haemaphysalis punctata_ (Canestrini & Fanzago, 1878) already existed in the study area, while the other 2 species, i.e., _D. silvarum_ (Olenev, 1931) and _Ha. spinulosa_ (Neumann, 1906), were identified for the 1st time (Table 1 [see source URL above for all tables]). These 2 species are new records for the country. _Hyalomma anatolicum_ was the dominant species collected from all hosts (cattle, buffaloes, goats and sheep), while the newly recorded species (_D. silvarum_ and _Ha. spinulosa_) were collected from sheep and goats (Table 2).

It will be interesting to learn if these 2 new species are present in other provinces in Pakistan and if pathogens that affect livestock or human health, such as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, are found in them. As noted in the report above, the presence of large numbers of ticks on livestock, even without transmission of pathogens, can have a significant deleterious effect on the health and productivity of livestock. - Mod.TY
