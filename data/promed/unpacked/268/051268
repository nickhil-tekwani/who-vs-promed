"Is Hepatitis E an Emerging Zoonotic Disease?" M. Favorov, O. Nazarova and
H. Margolis. U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta,
Georgia; Institute Prevention Medicine, Ashgabad, Turkmenistan.
According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 2nd International
Conference on Emerging Zoonoses, held 5-9 Nov 1998, in Strasbourg, France,
"Limited studies indicate that a substantial proportion of acute viral
hepatitis that occurs in Asia, the Indian subcontinent, Africa and Mexico
is caused by hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection. Non-human primates have
been shown to be susceptible to experimental HEV infection and HEV RNA
[ribonucleic acid] antibody to HEV (anti-HEV) were found among domestic
swine in Nepal.
Recently, a novel virus closely related to the HEV was identified that has
a 80% identity with human HEV. However, swine are not raised in most
regions of Asia known to have high endemic rates of HEV infection.
To investigate whether HEV infection occurs in other domestic animals,
anti-HEV activity was determine in 354 serum specimens obtained from 1-2
year old cows living in three countries where HEV infection has been shown
to be highly endemic (Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan) and one country
where HEV infection has not been reported (Ukraine). Anti-HEV activity was
found in 29%-62% of animals from high endemic countries. The prevalence of
antibody was highest in Somalia, a country where an outbreak of hepatitis E
occurred prior to the collection of the serum samples. Compared to high
endemic countries, the prevalence of anti-HEV was 11.9% in the Ukraine
(p<0.001), a country where hepatitis E outbreaks have not occurred. In the
Turkmenistan Republic, the anti-HEV activity among 52 domestic animals
(cows, sheep, and goats) was 42%-67%, with no difference between species.
Anti-HEV activity was found in 20% of animals less than 6 month of age, the
prevalence in adults was 57%-60%, and antibody activity in animals varied
between farms (27% to 78%, P<0.04).
The presence of past HEV infection among domestic animals in areas with a
high endemicity of human infection suggests the zoonotic nature of this
disease."
