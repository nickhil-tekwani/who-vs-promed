-----------------------------------------------
Although the content of the Eurosurveillance article reported in the
above ProMED-mail posting is absolutely correct, I'd like to add a
short comment.

One should never forget that risk assessment based on the detection
and notification of clinical cases has at least 3 aspects of bias:

1) The impact of vaccination rates on incidence rates;

2) Under-detection and under-reporting of cases -- not only but
especially in borderline areas (i.e. areas which were not classified
as risky until now and where doctors have only limited experience
with a "new" disease) -- and lack of adherence to the formally
mandatory notification system;

3) The low percentage of classical (i.e. biphasic) courses out of the
total number of infections; diseases with just the 1st phase of
infection will only get diagnosed by chance.

Although, of course, vaccination provides the best protection, people
should nevertheless be instructed in tick bite prevention and the
need for early detection and non-traumatic tick removal.
