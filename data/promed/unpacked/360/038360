Anthrax matches Army spores
----------------------------------
For nearly a decade, US Army scientists at Dugway Proving Ground in
Utah have made small quantities of weapons-grade anthrax that is
virtually identical to the powdery spores used in the mail attacks
that have killed 5 people, government sources say. Until the anthrax
attacks led to tighter security measures, anthrax grown at Dugway was
regularly sent by Federal Express to the Army's biodefense center, at
the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious
Diseases[USAMRIID at Fort Detrick, in Frederick [MD, where the
bacteria were killed using gamma radiation before being returned to
Dugway for experiments. The anthrax was shipped in the form of a
coarse paste, not in the far more dangerous finely milled form,
according to one government official.
Most anthrax testing at Dugway, in a barren Utah desert 87 miles
southwest of Salt Lake City, is done using the killed spores to reduce
the chance of accidental exposure of workers there. But some
experiments require live anthrax, milled to the tiny particle size
expected on a battlefield, to test both decontamination techniques and
biological agent detection systems, the sources say.
Anthrax is also grown at Fort Detrick, where it is used chiefly to
test the effectiveness of vaccines in animals. But that medical
program uses a wet aerosol fog of anthrax rather than the dry powder
used in the attacks and at Dugway, according to interviews and medical
journal articles based on the research. The wet anthrax, while still
capable of killing people, is safer for laboratory workers to handle,
scientists say.

Army confirms making anthrax in recent years
---------------------------------------------------
The US Army's Dugway Proving Ground confirmed last night that it has
produced dry anthrax powder in recent years but said the anthrax has
been "well-protected" and is all accounted for. The statement is the
first admission that any US government program has produced the lethal
dry powder since the offensive biological weapons program was closed
in 1969.
The term "weapons-grade" means that the anthrax particles are tiny
enough -- 1 to 5 microns -- to be readily inhaled and deposited in the
lungs. A sufficient dose produces inhalation anthrax, which is blamed
for killing 5 people since October [2001. Some of the anthrax
produced by Dugway has matched the fine particle size and
extraordinary concentration of the powder mailed to Senate Majority
Leader Tom Daschle, estimated at close to 1 [US trillion spores per
gram [= 1 UK billion, according to a government scientist. In
addition, the mailed anthrax is genetically indistinguishable from
the Ames strain used by the Army, the most sophisticated test methods
show. Neither the physical nor the genetic match proves that the
terrorist used anthrax from Dugway. The FBI appears to be taking
seriously the possibility of a link to Dugway. Personnel working with
anthrax, all of whom have been vaccinated against the bacterium, have
been questioned at length by investigators.
A government official familiar with the Dugway program said about a
half-dozen scientists there have the expertise to make dry anthrax. No
one with such expertise has left the program in recent years, the
official said. The unsigned, 2-page Dugway statement e-mailed to
reporters last night says scientists there "routinely" make anthrax to
test decontamination methods and equipment designed to detect
biological agents. It confirms The Sun's report that most experiments
use simulants or anthrax spores inactivated by radiation, but certain
tests "must be performed with live agents."
"All anthrax used at Dugway has been accounted for," the statement
says. "There is a rigorous tracking and inventory program to follow
the production, receipt and destruction of all select agents. The
facility is well-protected with robust physical and personnel security
systems." The statement says the Army is cooperating with the FBI and
"will not comment further on any aspect of its
bio testing program" until the investigation concludes.
For bacteria such as anthrax, the facility is limited to growing 100
milliliters, or 3 fluid ounces, at a time. The maximum concentration
of spores would be 10 [US billion per milliliter [= 10 000 million,
according to the Environmental Impact Statement.

This article covers a report at the recent Decatur expert meeting by
Dr Bill Kournikakis of the Canadian [military laboratory, Suffield,
on their experiments on monitoring what happens when an envelope
containing spores is opened. Using slit samplers they amply
demonstrated that 0.1 gm of spores was sufficient to expose someone to
a lethal dose or 22 to 480 LD50s; it was even higher when the envelope
contained 1 gm at 140 to 3080 LD50s. It is estimated that the Daschle
letter contained some 2 gm of spores.
It is very fortunate that the Daschle staff were immediately put on
antibiotics. But past experience would indicate that such high
exposures could overwhelm any antibiotic, so now there are questions
as to what is a lethal dose and how this is modified by an
individual's health. It is clear that the deceased Connecticut woman
was exposed to a minimal lethal dose. On the assumption that the Leahy
letter contained an equivalent amount to the Daschle letter (2gm), it
would seem that the perpetrator used some 7- 10+ gm of spores [1 gm is
roughly the weight of 1 US 10 cent piece or dime to spike his letters
to Florida (2), New York (3) & Washington (2). - Mod.MHJ.
