The Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDi) has said Kenyans suffering from visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar) will no longer go through the painful 17-day injection treatment after the successful clinical trial of a better, shorter new combination of treatment [see citation below].

Trials that were conducted in Eastern Africa showed that combining miltefosine (oral drug) and paromomycin (injection drug) reduced daily injections and hospitalisation from 17 to 14 days.

The study began in 2017 in Kenya, Ethiopia, Sudan, and Uganda, and the results showed the new combination as being 91% effective in treating kala-azar.

Prof Ahmed Musa, deputy vice-chancellor of the University of Khartoum and principal investigator in the trial conducted in Sudan says the "new treatment will eliminate the painful and toxic injection from the treatment."

Kala-azar is caused by protozoan parasites transmitted by the bite of infected female phlebotomine sandflies. Its symptoms include fever, anaemia, weight loss, and enlargement of the spleen and liver.

DNDi ranks kala-azar as the deadliest parasitic killer after malaria if untreated.

Children will benefit from the new combination treatment as it reduces the period for hospitalisation besides lowering common complications like post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) to 4% from 20.9%.

This means that there will be a reduction in transmission since post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis patients are a source of infection to sandflies.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) says the disease mostly affects the poor and is associated with malnutrition, population displacement, poor housing, and a weak immune system.

It is linked to environmental changes like deforestation, dam constructions, irrigation schemes, and urbanisation.

WHO estimates there are between 50 000 and 90 000 new annual cases globally. In 2020, more than 90% of new cases were in Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Yemen, Brazil, China, and India.

The current 1st-line treatment in Eastern Africa consists of paromomycin, an injectable antibiotic used in combination with sodium stibogluconate that is administered intravenously or through 2 injections daily for 17 days.

Prof Musa said this treatment "has a significant socio-economic impact as patients are forced to stay in hospital for extended periods and have to miss school or work."

The patients may suffer side effects like cardiotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and pancreatitis associated with sodium stibogluconate.

Dr Monique Wasunna, DNDi Eastern Africa Regional Director in Kenya, terms the new combination treatment "a historical step forward for dreadful and neglected patient populations."

Acting director general for health, Dr Patrick Amoth, said the results of the clinical trial "would contribute to the strategic goal of reducing morbidity due to Leishmaniasis by 60% by 2025."

Dr Fabiana Alves, director of the Leishmaniasis and Mycetoma cluster at DNDi, said, "Our goal is to radically transform treatments for visceral leishmaniasis by developing patient-friendly oral therapies that are affordable, safe, and effective in all regions."

"Abstract
-------
"Background: This study aimed to determine whether paromomycin plus miltefosine (PM/MF) is noninferior to sodium stibogluconate plus paromomycin (SSG/PM) for treatment of primary visceral leishmaniasis in eastern Africa.

"Methods: An open-label, phase 3, randomized, controlled trial was conducted in adult and pediatric patients at 7 sites in eastern Africa. Patients were randomly assigned to either 20 mg/kg paromomycin plus allometric dose of miltefosine (14 days), or 20 mg/kg sodium stibogluconate plus 15 mg/kg paromomycin (17 days). The primary endpoint was definitive cure after 6 months.

"Results: Of 439 randomized patients, 424 completed the trial. Definitive cure at 6 months was 91.2% (155 of 170) and 91.8% (156 of 170) in the PM/MF and SSG/PM arms in primary efficacy modified intention-to-treat analysis (difference, 0.6%; 97.5% confidence interval [CI], -6.2 to 7.4), narrowly missing the noninferiority margin of 7%. In the per-protocol analysis, efficacy was 92% (149 of 162) and 91.7% (155 of 169) in the PM/MF and SSG/PM arms (difference, -0.3%; 97.5% CI, -7.0 to 6.5), demonstrating noninferiority. Treatments were well tolerated. Four of 18 serious adverse events were study drug-related, and 1 death was SSG-related. Allometric dosing ensured similar MF exposure in children (<12 years) and adults.

"Conclusions: PM/MF and SSG/PM efficacies were similar, and adverse drug reactions were as expected given the drugs' safety profiles. With one less injection each day, reduced treatment duration, and no risk of SSG-associated life-threatening cardiotoxicity, PM/MF is a more patient-friendly alternative for children and adults with primary visceral leishmaniasis in eastern Africa."

This study was conducted at 7 sites in Kenya, Uganda, Sudan, and Ethiopia, which are countries that are not only endemic for visceral leishmaniasis (VL, kala-azar) but have also experienced a rise in cases of VL in certain locales. The current standard treatment regimen in Eastern Africa includes intravenous sodium stibogluconate, an antimony-containing compound that carries a significant risk of organ toxicity, particularly pancreatitis, as well as localized phlebitis and venous thrombosis. Furthermore, drug resistance to sodium stibogluconate has been frequently demonstrated in leishmania isolates responsible for cutaneous as well as visceral leishmaniasis. The current study showing that the regimen of oral miltefosine plus paromomycin is equally efficacious as sodium stibogluconate plus paromomycin, but with less toxicity, is therefore welcome news. In South Asia (including India, Bangladesh, and Nepal), the regimen of miltefosine plus paromomycin has already been shown to be effective for kala-azar, as well as treatment with liposomal amphotericin B alone. -Mod.LXL
