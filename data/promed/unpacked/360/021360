What we know about transmission of the Ebola virus among humans
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Ebola virus is transmitted among humans through close and direct physical contact with infected bodily fluids, the most infectious being blood, faeces and vomit.

The Ebola virus has also been detected in breast milk, urine and semen. In a convalescent male, the virus can persist in semen for at least 70 days; one study suggests persistence for more than 90 days.

Saliva and tears may also carry some risk. However, the studies implicating these additional bodily fluids were extremely limited in sample size and the science is inconclusive. In studies of saliva, the virus was found most frequently in patients at a severe stage of illness. The whole live virus has never been isolated from sweat.

The Ebola virus can also be transmitted indirectly, by contact with previously contaminated surfaces and objects. The risk of transmission from these surfaces is low and can be reduced even further by appropriate cleaning and disinfection procedures.

Not an airborne virus
-------------------
Ebola virus disease is not an airborne infection. Airborne spread among humans implies inhalation of an infectious dose of virus from a suspended cloud of small dried droplets.

This mode of transmission has not been observed during extensive studies of the Ebola virus over several decades.

Common sense and observation tell us that spread of the virus via coughing or sneezing is rare, if it happens at all. Epidemiological data emerging from the outbreak are not consistent with the pattern of spread seen with airborne viruses, like those that cause measles and chickenpox, or the airborne bacterium that causes tuberculosis.

Theoretically, wet and bigger droplets from a heavily infected individual, who has respiratory symptoms caused by other conditions or who vomits violently, could transmit the virus -- over a short distance -- to another nearby person. This could happen when virus-laden heavy droplets are directly propelled, by coughing or sneezing (which does not mean airborne transmission) onto the mucus membranes or skin with cuts or abrasions of another person.

WHO is not aware of any studies that actually document this mode of transmission [in humans]. On the contrary, good quality studies from previous Ebola outbreaks show that all cases were infected by direct close contact with symptomatic patients.

No evidence that viral diseases change their mode of transmission
-----------------------------------------------------------
Moreover, scientists are unaware of any virus that has dramatically changed its mode of transmission. For example, the H5N1 avian influenza virus, which has caused sporadic human cases since 1997, is now endemic in chickens and ducks in large parts of Asia. That virus has probably circulated through many billions of birds for at least two decades. Its mode of transmission remains basically unchanged.

Speculation that Ebola virus disease might mutate into a form that could easily spread among humans through the air is just that: speculation, unsubstantiated by any evidence.

This kind of speculation is unfounded but understandable as health officials race to catch up with this fast-moving and rapidly evolving outbreak.

To stop this outbreak, more needs to be done to implement - on a much larger scale - well-known protective and preventive measures. Abundant evidence has documented their effectiveness.

A Norwegian aid worker at Doctors Without Borders [MSF] in Sierra Leone has contracted Ebola, the organization said on Mon [6 Oct 2014], and health authorities in Norway are preparing to treat the patient. "We can unfortunately confirm that one of our Norwegian field workers has tested positive for Ebola," said Anne Cecilie Kaltenborn, the secretary-general of Doctors Without Borders Norway, at an Oslo news conference. The aid worker was identified by Norwegian media as a woman working in Bo, Sierra Leone's second-biggest city...
The affected Norwegian field worker would be isolated and treated in Oslo. She had been isolated on Sun [5 Oct 2014] after contracting a fever, and a lab test confirmed that she had Ebola.

The French nurse, who was diagnosed with Ebola virus disease while engaging in healthcare work in Monrovia, Liberia's capital, and was repatriated to France for treatment, has been confirmed to have recovered from the disease by Doctors Without Borders [MSF}. The medical charity, which has shouldered a large part of the response to the West African outbreak, said Saturday [4 Oct 2014] that it received confirmation from the French Health Ministry that the woman had survived the disease. She was evacuated from Liberia and cared for at a hospital near Paris.

The University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf in Germany also said Sat [4 Oct 2014] that a Senegalese scientist who was infected with Ebola in Sierra Leone has recovered and been discharged. [He was a WHO consultant epidemiologist. -Mod.JW]

ANSM [Agence Nationale de Securite du Medicament et des Produits de Sante] stated that a treatment combining Avigan [Favipiravir] and another experimental drug started on 19 Sep 2014. The [French] patient is taking Avigan as of 25 Sep 2014. Fujifilm and Toyama Chemical will continue to work together with relevant pharmaceutical authorities, international organizations and infectious disease specialists to explore the potential of leveraging Avigan for patients with the Ebola virus disease.... - more

US military to put up tent at Liberia Ebola clinic
-------------------------------------------------------------
Poor infrastructure, difficulties with equipment and torrential rains have slowed work for the U.S. military's initial response to the deadly Ebola outbreak in West Africa, but it is now ready to start erecting the main tent for a field hospital in Liberia.

Lt. Col. Jason Brown, who was at the site near the airport in the capital Monrovia, said work is supposed to begin Monday afternoon [6 Oct 2014] on the main structure of the 25-bed clinic that will treat healthcare workers infected with Ebola. It should be ready to accept patients at the end of the month, according to spokesman Chuck Prichard at the U.S. military's Africa Command.

"Every time it rains it slows things down," said Brown, noting that construction for the field hospital was supposed to begin Monday [6 Oct 2014] morning and has been pushed to the afternoon. Military teams have also been slowed by equipment that's broken down -- including the steering on a road grader -- or mix-ups in the delivery of supplies... - more

[5] Liberia: burials without benefit of PPE

"Traditional Man" buries 21 suspected Ebola victims in Bong county
------------------------------------------------------------------
On the one hand they are told not to touch Ebola bodies, but on the other people don't show up to bury them for days. [A 62 year old male], of the Kpelle tribe has disclosed that he has buried 21 suspected Ebola bodies in the village of Balakerthela, one of the quarantined communities in Bong County. He said he carried out this dangerous feat "without the recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) being used by health workers to conduct the burial of Ebola suspected bodies."

Balakerthela is located in the Konoyea Clan in Salala District and it is one of the communities hardest hit by Ebola deaths which forced the County Health Team (CHT) to quarantine the area last August [2014].

Speaking through an interpreter last weekend in Balakerthela, [this man] said he decided to bury the suspected Ebola bodies because the Burial Team failed to act quickly to bury the bodies. "Sometimes there are about 3-4 dead bodies in the village in a day's time and the corpses would remain in the village for 3 days awaiting the arrival of the burial team. At the same time the Health Team is telling us that the longer you keep the dead bodies, the faster the disease will spread", [he] exclaimed...

[This is only true if people touch the bodies - it does not spread through the air. - Mod.JW]

When cross-examined about what precisely he used to conduct the burial in the absence of the standard personal protective equipment (PPE), the old man told how he applied traditional herbs on the corpses and also rubbed these herbs on himself and his colleagues before carrying out the interments. These herbs when used on a dead body, will prevent it from smelling horrible for a week, he disclosed.

"The townspeople only help with the digging of the grave but we are the ones to place the bodies in the graves" the old man remarked, pounding his chest with his right hand. He informed this reporter that he has been in the business for the past 30 years but was swift to acknowledge that one of his helpers ... died just a week ago. But [he] said he was not exactly sure as to whether his colleague died from the deadly Ebola virus...

"If the old man were not immune to the virus, why did [only] his colleague who has been helping him to carry on the burials fall prey to the virus?" a social worker asked. A health practitioner argued that [this man] cannot be resistant to the virus when [the man] has not previously suffered and survived from the Ebola virus disease, adding that the old man is being protected by supernatural powers.

It was also established by the Daily Observer that some residents of Balakerthela have left the village for sanctuary in other satellite villages for fear of contracting Ebola... - more

[Perhaps there is such a thing as subclinical or very mild infection, leading to solid immunity. If only a BL-4 lab had the time to test the effect of those herbs on this ebolavirus -- if they could really protect hands, they could be used in places where gloves have not yet arrived, which appears to be a chronic problem. But I am speculating about protection; I am NOT recommending herbal remedies in the place of standard EVD treatment. - Mod.JW]
