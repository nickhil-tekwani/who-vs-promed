'Bugtok' affecting banana plantations
-------------------------------------
At least 5 per cent of banana plantations in Negros Occidental [Region VI, Western Visayas] has been affected by the "bugtok" disease. According to a provincial official, the disease was [being] monitored in the southern part of the province, as well as in towns in the north. Based on the latest mapping of the Office of the Provincial Agriculturist, around 12 hectares [29.7 acres] were initially affected, mostly backyards or small farms.

Bugtok disease is caused by bacteria and mostly affects cardaba or saba banana varieties. Symptoms manifest in the darkening of the fruits.

Disinfection through maintaining cleanliness and proper spacing should be practiced. Matured banana fruits should be immediately harvested to avoid damage. Assessment and monitoring of affected banana farms continue.

[Bugtok, as well as the other bacterial wilts of banana and plantain known as blood disease and moko, are caused by members of the _Ralstonia solanacearum_ (Rs) species complex (see link below). Within the complex, strains causing moko and bugtok are closely related causing similar symptoms (including wilting, fruit rot, blackening of suckers, bacterial ooze), while the blood disease bacterium is more distantly related with characteristic red internal discolouration ("blood") of fruits and pseudostems. All 3 diseases cause severe yield losses and eventually death of the plants.

The bacteria are spread by water, wind, infected plant material, or soil, and mechanical means (including human activities, animals, insects). Suckers for propagation pose a high risk of spreading the diseases. Ornamentals and weed species may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Infection can occur via roots or flowers depending on the host cultivar and pathogen strain. The primary means of control is exclusion from areas that are disease-free and eradication of infected plants where the pathogens are present. Disease management may also include cultural (removal of male flowers), chemical (for example soil treatments) and biocontrol (antagonistic microorganisms) measures, or combinations of these. Certified clean planting material is essential. No resistant banana or plantain cultivars are known.

Bugtok has only been reported from the Philippines. It is now widespread and has become a serious problem in local plantain (cooking banana) varieties, such as cardaba and saba mentioned above (triploid cultivated varieties of _Musa balbisiana_, BBB Group; see links below). It causes blackening and hardening of the fruit which makes them unfit for consumption.

Members of the _R. solanacearum_ complex affect more than 200 plant species including many important crops (for example, causing brown rot of potato). The various races and biovars are active under different climatic conditions and in different hosts.
