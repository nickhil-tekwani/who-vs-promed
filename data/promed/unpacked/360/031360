Two cases of measles have been identified in people who went to a popular Welsh music festival earlier this month [July 2016], it has been confirmed.

Public Health Wales is urging people to be "rash aware" after spotting 2 cases with links to the [Llanfyllin] Workhouse Festival in North Powys between 8-10 Jul [2016].

People are being urged to phone their [doctor] or local hospital before attending if they, or their child, have a rash-like illness.

Those with symptoms are asked not to socialise with children or other vulnerable individuals including infants, pregnant women, and those with a weakened immune system for around 10 days after symptoms start.

Measles is a serious and highly contagious viral disease that can cause complications and can even prove fatal.

The illness starts with cold or flu-like symptoms, followed by a rash after 2-4 days.

Public Health Wales said crowds of people provide the "perfect environment" for infectious diseases like measles to circulate, but 2 doses of the safe and effective MMR vaccine offer protection.

Dr Christopher Johnson, acting consultant in health protection for Public Health Wales, said: "We know both these cases attended the festival and are therefore asking anyone else who attended to be aware of the symptoms of measles.

"Many people who catch measles will have a fever, cough, red eyes, and blocked nose and feel generally unwell. The blotchy rash appears a few days later, beginning on the face and spreading downwards to the rest of the body over several days.

"Measles is highly contagious, so we are asking people who think they may have the symptoms to telephone ahead before attending for medical advice."

Public Health Wales said it was already aware of cases of measles in Wales linked to another festival.

Dr Johnson added: "If you have not received 2 doses of MMR and attend large events where hundreds of people are present, you are at risk of contracting measles. People around you may not have any symptoms but could still be infectious."
