More than 100 children get viral encephalitis in Eastern China
--------------------------------------------------------------
More than 100 children in Fujian province have been infected with
viral encephalitis since the beginning of May 2011, local health
authorities said Wednesday [1 Jun 2011].

Hospitals in Anxi county have reported 200 such cases since 1 Jun
2011, of which 115 have been confirmed, said Wu Zhengxin, director of
the county's health bureau. An investigation by experts from the
Ministry of Health and local disease control centers has indicated
that the outbreak was caused by ECHO30-type intestinal virus [human
echovirus 30], according to Wu.

Infected local children were being treated at Mingxuan Hospital of
Anxi county and were in stable condition, Wu said. Another 9 children,
also from Anxi county, were diagnosed in hospitals in Xiamen city of
Fujian and were receiving treatment there, Wu added. The children, all
under the age of 12, are from 75 villages of 14 townships in the
county.

Children of 3 to 7 years old account for 78 percent of the total, and
117 children, or 65 percent, are from the town of Hutou. Local health
authorities are closely monitoring the disease to prevent its further
spread, Wu said.

[It is likely that these children are suffering from meningitis,
rather than encephalitis per se. Meningitis is an inflammation of the
membranes (meninges) that cover the brain and spinal cord. Viral
infections are the most common cause of meningitis. Different viral
infections can lead to viral meningitis. Most cases are observed
during the summer and autumn months, and are caused by enteroviruses
(which include enteroviruses, coxsackieviruses, and echoviruses). Most
people who are infected with enteroviruses either have no symptoms or
only get a cold, rash, or mouth sores with low-grade fever; only a
small number develop meningitis. There is no specific treatment for
viral meningitis. Most patients completely recover on their own within
2 weeks. A hospital stay may be necessary in more severe cases or for
people with weak immune systems.

Enteroviruses, the most common cause of viral meningitis, are most
often spread through direct contact with an infected person's faeces.
The virus is spread through this route mainly among small children who
are not yet toilet trained. It can also be spread this way to older
children. The time from when a person is infected until they develop
symptoms (incubation period) is usually between 3 and 7 days for
enteroviruses. An infected child is usually contagious from the time
they develop symptoms until the symptoms go away.

Taxonomically, _Human echovirus 30_ is a member of the virus species
_Human enterovirus B_, genus _Enterovirus_, family Picornaviridae_. It
is one of several viruses associated with aseptic (viral)
encephalitis. It is distributed globally and appears to circulate as
several continuously evolving strains. For example, a recent paper
(Virus Genes. 2011 Apr;42(2):178-88. Epub 2011 Jan 8. Molecular
epidemiology of Echovirus 30 in Taiwan, 1988-2008. Ke GM, Lin KH, Lu
PL, Tung YC, Wang CF, Ke LY, Lee MS, Lin PC, Su HJ, Lin YY, Huang TP,
Wang JR, Wang SY, Hsu LC, Chu PY.) describes phylogenetic analysis
which identified 6 human echovirus 30 genotypes that have circulated
globally during 5 decades. The genotypes varied widely in geographic
distribution and circulation half-life. GI, GII, and GV were ancient
genotypes in which the 1st strains emerged in the 1950s. GIII was a
reemerging genotype, in which strains had 1st appeared in Colombia in
1995 before reemerging in the New Independent States (NIS) in 2003.
GIV, an emerging genotype that recently appeared in Asia in 2003, was
closely related to the ancient genotypes. The GVI was the circulating
genotype, which included 8 clusters (A-H) that had circulated since
1967. No GVI-A, C, D, or E strains have been identified during the
past 10 years. The GVI-B 1st appeared in China in 1984 and later in
Russia and Asia in the 2000s. The GVI-F, G, and H strains, which
comprised the prevalent clusters, had been dominant in the Asia
Pacific area, globally, and Europe, respectively. Taiwanese strains
were classified into GVI-D (1988-1989), GVI-F (1993-2004), and GVI-G
(1993-2008).

This analysis illustrated the diversity of human echovirus 30, and it
is probable that the outbreak in Fujian province signals the
appearance of a new variant, or the reemergence of an older strain.
