More than 70 000 people in north Wales have been told to boil their
water before drinking it after an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis. More
than 100 cases of cryptosporidium infection, which can cause
diarrhoea that lasts around 2 weeks, have been confirmed by health
officials in Gwynedd, who warn more diagnoses are likely.
The source of the infection -- from which sufferers are expected to
make a full recovery -- has not been officially identified, but
investigators are focusing on a reservoir in Snowdonia.
Welsh Water has warned customers to boil their tap water until the new year.

[Cryptosporidiosis is common in the United Kingdom, and outbreaks
occur almost annually (see below). Outbreaks are seen when surface
water contaminated with Cryptosporidium cysts are used for drinking.
Cattle is a reservoir for Cryptosporidium, which is resistant to
chlorination. - Mod.EP]
