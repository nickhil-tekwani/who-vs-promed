Classical Swine fever in Ukraine in wild boar
---------------------------------------------
(results of the epidemiological investigation)
Translation of information received on 11 July 2002 from Dr Petr I.
Verbytskiy, Head, State Department for Veterinary Medicine, Ministry of
Agricultural Policy, Kiev:
End of previous report period: 28 Aug 2001
End of this report period: 11 July 2002.
In order to study the epidemiological situation in the forested zone of
Trachtemirivskae regional landscape park after detection of cases of
classical swine fever (CSF) in wild boar and to demonstrate possible CSF
virus circulation among them, a series of diagnostic and laboratory tests
was conducted on six wild boars shot in different parts of the park.
Diagnosis:
A. Laboratories where tests were made:
-- Tcherkassy State Zonal Specialised Laboratory of Veterinary Medicine
-- The CSF Scientific Research Center of the Institute for Veterinary
Medicine of the Ukrainian Academy of Agrarian Sciences.
B. Diagnostic tests used: direct immunofluorescence, ELISA (enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay), cell culture.
C. Laboratory results: all the tests were negative.
Control measures:
On the basis of the obtained results, all the restrictions have been lifted.

[Though the results, based upon 6 samples, are encouraging, their
significance could be assessed if the (estimated) numbers of wild boars
within the relevant geographic area (Trachtemirivskae regional landscape
park) were included. For instance: Slovenia reported to the OIE, on 24 May
2002, about the detection of specific CSF antibodies in wild boar
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_70.HTM#Sec4>. Their report was based
upon examinations of 64 samples (spleen and coagulum) of wild boar, of
which 14 tested positive for specific antibodies to classical swine fever
virus. However, all samples (including the 14 samples positive for specific
antibodies) were negative to the antigen ELISA test. - Mod. AS]
