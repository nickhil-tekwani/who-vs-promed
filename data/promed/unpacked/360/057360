Assessment of Public Health Computer Readiness for 2000 --
United States, 1999
Computer software, equipment, and other devices that contain
embedded microchips that store and process dates may use two-
digit years (e.g., 99 for 1999) to reduce data entry burden and
save electronic storage space; these devices may not work
properly when the year 2000 (Y2K) arrives (1). Many aspects of
health-care delivery, public health surveillance and research, and
critical infrastructure components (e.g., utilities and transportation
services) depend on vulnerable computers. To ensure that critical
public health functions will not be compromised because of Y2K
problems, CDC assessed state public health agency readiness for
Y2K. This report describes the findings of the assessment, which
indicate that state health agencies that responded are substantially
ready for Y2K and plan to reach full readiness in 1999.
In November 1998, CDC sent surveys to health officials in all
states, territories, and the District of Columbia using a
standardized questionnaire; responses were received from
December 1998 through February 1999. Questions were asked
about the degree of Y2K assessment performed and the degree of
Y2K readiness achieved in 10 functional areas essential to public
health and potentially vulnerable to Y2K problems. CDC received
completed surveys from 29 states, representing 75% of the U.S.
population.
The 29 public health agencies reported an average of 92%
(median: 93%; range: 85%-99%) completion for the Y2K
assessment across the 10 functional areas listed in the survey
(Table 1). The level of Y2K readiness averaged 77% (median:
75%; range: 66%-93%) across the 10 areas; one state reported
Y2K readiness in all areas. All states (with one exception in one
functional area) reported intentions to reach full readiness during
1999 across all functional areas (Table 2). However, there were
35 responses of "unknown" in various functional areas, with the
greatest number (14) regarding the readiness of local public health
agencies. Thirty-four percent of the respondents lacked a
contingency plan, 49% had plans to develop one, and 17% did not
intend to develop one.
Reported by: Information Resources Management Office, Office of
the Director, CDC.
[MMWR Editorial Note
-----------------------------
The survey results indicate substantial Y2K readiness of many
computer-based functions, with plans to reach full Y2K readiness in
1999, in state health agencies that responded to the survey.
Because 21 states, all the U.S. territories, and the District of
Columbia did not respond, the survey findings do not reflect Y2K
readiness in these locations. In addition, the lack of information
about local public health agency readiness further limits the
assessment of public health system readiness overall. Given the
fixed deadline (December 31, 1999) for preparedness, states that
do not plan to be ready until the fourth quarter of 1999 may have
increased their risk for not completing the work in time. Finally, the
lack of an intent to develop a contingency plan in some states
further increases the risk for a longer interruption in service or
operations than would be the case with adequate planning.
CDC has achieved Y2K readiness for all its major information
systems and is in the final stages of ensuring that its infrastructure
is ready (e.g., facilities, laboratory equipment, desktop computers
and networking devices, telecommunications, and commercial
software products). CDC also has implemented a toll-free hotline to
provide Y2K information on health care and public health, telephone
(877) 232-2020. The system provides an automated fax
transmission consisting of a Y2K fact sheet and resource guide,
including Internet addresses for additional information on topics
such as medical devices, health-care sector Y2K readiness,
assessment checklists, and contingency planning templates.
The President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion reports that the
nation's major infrastructure services (e.g., telecommunications,
electric power production and distribution, banking and other
financial services, and transportation), will be ready and that no
major service disruptions will occur (1). Additional information is
available from the council, telephone (888) 872-4925 ([888 USA-4-
Y2K), and on the World-Wide Web, http://www.y2k.gov.
Health-care providers and government health agencies must
maintain a full commitment to Y2K preparations, readiness, testing,
and contingency planning. Public health and safety and the quality
of health care are paramount during the Y2K transition. All public
health partners are encouraged to develop rigorous contingency
plans and business continuity plans to assess and quickly respond
to any problems. To track progress and identify vulnerable areas,
CDC will repeat the state public health agency readiness
assessment in June 1999.
