MENINGITIS & MENINGOCOCCAL DISEASE - FLORIDA, USA (5)
=====================================================
This really is intriguing. In bacterial disease outbreaks examined to date
by molecular methods, it has been the case that molecular typing (by PCR)
essentially confirms what phenotypic markers already suggest. Namely, that
within a given outbreak all isolates are the same clone (i.e. genotype).
Recently, isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (one of the most common of
bacterial pathogens and one of the more virulent) have been shown to have
apparently switched serotypes (the extracellular polysaccharide capsule
covering the bacterium) while otherwise maintaining the same clonal identity
as determined by molecular methods (the genes encoding the polysaccharide
capsule comprise an operon or cassette). One could therefore imagine a
virulent N. meningitidis clone with the capacity for (for want of a better
way to put it) "hyperswitchability" of extracellular polysaccharide capsular
serotype. A straightforward molecular typing method, such as REP/ERIC PCR
[method using conserved repeat sequences in the genome] or
RAPD [random amplified polymorphic DNA] PCR, or possibly
multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE), would tell
you right away whether the isolates are of the same clone. Please keep us
updated both on the outbreak and on any attempts to genotype the isolates.
