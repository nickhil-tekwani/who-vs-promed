Tilapia lake virus disease (TiLV), Philippines
----------------------------------------------
Information received on 23 Nov 2017 from Dr Enrico Garzon, assistant secretary for livestock, Bureau of Animal Industry, Department of Agriculture, Quezon City, Philippines

Summary
Report type: immediate notification (final report)
Date of start of the event: 16 May 2017
Date of confirmation of the event: 29 Jun 2017
Date event resolved: 15 Sep 2017
Reason for notification: emerging disease
Morbidity: 8/33.7 per cent
Mortality: 8/33.7 per cent
Zoonotic impact: no
Causal agent: Tilapia lake virus (TiLV)

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks, total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Bulacan, Dampol 2nd , Pulilan, Bulacan
Date of start of the outbreak: 16 May 2017
Outbreak status: resolved on 15 Sep 2017
Epidemiological unit: pond
Water type: fresh water
Population type: farmed
Production system: semi-closed
Total animals affected:
Species / Morbidity / Mortality / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Tilapia (_Oreochromis niloticus_) / 34 per cent / 34 per cent / 300 000 / 101 363 / 101 363 / 0 / 0

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: an unexplained daily mortality of tilapia fingerlings was observed in the nursery pond of a private farm after stocking on [Tue 16 May 2017]. Elevated mortality after 15 days reached about 25 per cent. Affected fish showed abdominal distension and bulging of the eyes. On [Wed 31 May 2017] samples were collected and submitted at the Fisheries Biotechnology Center (FBC) Mu√±oz, Nueva Ecija. Semi-nested RT-PCR exhibited positive results using reported Tilapia Lake Virus (TiLV) primers. Other samples submitted to National Fisheries Laboratory - Fish Health of the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources also showed positive results by insulated isothermal PCR (iiPCR). The amplified segment 3 of the viral gene has 94-95 per cent nucleotide similarity to Israel TiLV strain. The movement of fingerlings from the affected pond is restricted and monitored. Results of the last 2 samplings showed negative for TiLV using iiPCR.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country, surveillance outside infected and/or protection zone, surveillance within infected and/or protection zone, screening, traceability, quarantine, disinfection, vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists), no treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Fisheries Biotechnology Center (Local laboratory) / Tilapia (_Oreochromis niloticus_) / reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 24 Jun 2017 / Positive
National Fisheries Laboratory (National laboratory) / Tilapia (_Oreochromis niloticus_) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 29 Jun 2017 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

"There has been no report of any human health-related issues linked to the consumption of affected tilapia from any of the affected countries since the emergence of TiLV. Looking at fish viruses overall, including TiLV, there is no evidence for a fish virus causing disease in humans." http://pubs.iclarm.net/resource_centre/FISH-2017-03.pdf. - Mod.CRD
