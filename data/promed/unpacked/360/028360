Kansas state veterinarian encourages livestock producers to watch for
signs of anthrax after flooding
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Flooding along the Missouri and other rivers through the central
United States is prompting a call for cattle and other livestock
producers to watch for signs of the deadly anthrax bacteria once
floodwaters recede.

"Cattle producers in areas along the Missouri River should watch for
unexplained cattle deaths which might occur as a result of anthrax
spores washing down and being consumed by cattle after the floodwaters
recede," said K-State Research and Extension veterinarian Larry
Hollis. Veterinarians and animal health officials in North Dakota,
Minnesota, and Canada have issued similar warnings.

"Because the Missouri River is carrying water from the Dakotas where
they historically have anthrax just about every summer, anthrax spores
may be carried down and end up on flooded Kansas backwater pastures,"
Hollis said. "Any unexplained cattle deaths should be reported
immediately to a veterinarian. The veterinarian may choose to necropsy
the carcass to make sure that anthrax is not the cause. Spores of
other spore-forming organisms, such as the clostridial species that
causes blackleg, also can be carried to new areas by floodwaters."

Anthrax, which can affect all mammals, is caused by a spore-forming
bacterium called _Bacillus anthracis_. Animals typically acquire the
disease by grazing in areas contaminated by spores. Cattle, bison,
sheep, goats, and horses are particularly susceptible. Anthrax spores
are hardy and occur naturally in the soil, where they can survive for
decades.

Humans can contract anthrax, but it is unusual to find a human case
of anthrax linked to an animal outbreak if proper precautions are
taken during the handling of affected carcasses, Hollis said. That's
why it is important for livestock owners to be vigilant in watching
for the disease, especially in animals grazing in previously-flooded
areas.

Death from anthrax can occur in a matter of hours from the time the
1st symptoms occur, so a seemingly healthy animal may die before
anyone notices clinical signs, he said. Animals that are discovered
before dying may appear distressed and have difficulty breathing.
Hemorrhaging from the mouth, nose, and anus is common. Pigs and
carnivores are more resistant to the disease, although they may
develop swelling in the neck and throat or have gastrointestinal
disturbances. Carcasses of animals that die of anthrax decompose
rapidly, and rigor mortis is often incomplete or absent.

If a livestock owner suspects anthrax in a live animal, or in the
case of a sudden death of unknown cause in previously-flooded areas,
he or she should not touch or move the animal. A veterinarian should
be called in to investigate the death and determine the proper samples
to test for anthrax along with the proper carcass disposal method.

[Livestock anthrax outbreaks after flooding is a long reported event.
How and why it should occur is unclear because of the nature of the
event -- during a flood everyone is very busy dealing with the
emergency and not taking soil samples, even if they knew where best to
take them.

But the most likely reasons are that the flood water floats the
hydrophobic spores from deep down in an old cattle grave and brings
them to the surface to be later grazed. Another, to explain outbreaks
on farms where it has not been seen before, is that the flood washes
out old graves and flushes the soil and spores downstream to be
deposited on a water meadow when the flood dies away. Nice as an
hypothesis but how is the spore concentration maintained over
significant distances or reconstructed to provide a lethal dose of
spores for a grazing animal that has to find that one spot to graze is
unclear. But such outbreaks do happen and are documented.

Some claim that excess ground water facilitates spore germination and
multiplication -- an area of some controversy -- but if that were to
happen with any frequency every farm that has ever had an outbreak
would still be having outbreaks in spite of vaccination and time.

At the present time there are very, very few enzootic areas for
anthrax in the US and Canada; one can all but list the actual farms
and ranches they are so few. Other countries are the same; for example
the UK regularly had some 450 dead cows from anthrax each year for
decades. Thanks to changes in how bone meal is handled the frequency
of outbreaks has died away during the past 25 years such that the
disease is now essentially eradicated. This is a common event in many
European countries.

So if you or your clients are running cattle in Kansas, the Dakotas,
Minnesota (USA), Manitoba, and Saskatchewan (Canada) and they are not
already vaccinated, round them up and vaccinate them now. And if it is
too hot for that, check them regularly, and have any sudden death
looked at immediately. Yes, 'blackleg' due to _Clostridium chauvoei_,
is probably more common and not too dissimilar in signs but anthrax
tends not to kill single animals but expensive numbers when it occurs.
Both are readily prevented by vaccination. Of course doing nothing
provides a marvelous opportunity for the rest of us to say, when an
outbreak occurs and it will, "See. So-and-so didn't vaccinate his
animals and he had -- animals die." - Mod.MHJ]
