Rift Valley fever cases were confirmed in livestock in Ol Kalou sub-county 2 weeks ago, prompting the ongoing massive vaccination.

Muraya said that because of the outbreak in Ol Kalou, the county administration had put in place a mosquito control programme to curb breeding of the parasites.

According to the Ministry of Health, at least 26 people died from the viral disease last year [2018] in the country.

On 3 Jun 2018, Director of Medical Services Jackson Kioko asked all counties to be on high alert over Rift Valley fever. Baringo, Kajiado, Garissa, Lamu, Mandera and Tharaka Nithi had reported cases of the disease.

Dr Kioko said cholera, chikungunya, measles and Rift Valley fever had been reported in the country since January 2018.

Symptoms of Rift Valley fever in livestock include nasal discharge, excess salivation, and loss of appetite, weakness, diarrhoea and abortion.

Tests conducted at the Kenya Medical Research Institute laboratory in Nairobi last week confirmed that 2 people had contracted the zoonotic viral disease [Rift Valley fever].

Health Chief Officer Joram Muraya said that by yesterday [11 Feb 2019], samples from 2 other people suspected to be suffering from the disease had been sent to Government laboratories for analysis.

The 2 [confirmed] cases are from Rurii village in Ol Kalou sub-county, where the 1st infections were reported last week.

The victims, according to medics, had symptoms of Rift Valley fever, which include muscle pain, dizziness, weight loss and headache. The disease is spread to human beings through contact with infected animals [and transmitted by vector mosquitoes - Mod.TY].

"The victims come from the same locality, and we suspect they might have had contact with infected animals," said Dr Muraya.

[2018 was an active year for Rift Valley fever (RVF) in livestock and in people. In July and August 2018, there were 10 RVF outbreaks reported to OIE. A 12 Jul 2018 report indicated that more than 10 people died following an outbreak of RVF in Kenya, with more than 120 cases reported countrywide. RVF virus is endemic in Kenya. Mosquitoes infected with the virus can pass it along through eggs. These eggs can persist alive with the virus when laid in wet areas (dambos) and can survive subsequent drying. They hatch when water returns, and virus transmission can begin again.

As Mod.AS noted in an earlier 2018 post, Rift Valley fever is a per-acute or acute zoonotic disease of domestic ruminants. The virus is confined to the African continent and Arabian Peninsula. It is caused by a single serotype of a mosquito-borne virus of the _Bunyaviridae_ family (genus _Phlebovirus_). The disease occurs in climatic conditions favouring the breeding of mosquito vectors and is characterised by abortion, neonatal mortality and liver damage. The disease is most severe in sheep, goats and cattle. Older non-pregnant animals, although susceptible to infection, are more resistant to clinical disease. There is considerable variation in the susceptibility to RVF of animals of different species. Camels usually have an inapparent infection with RVF virus (RVFV), but sudden mortality, neonatal mortality, and abortion occur, and abortion rates can be as high as in cattle.

Humans are susceptible to RVFV and are infected through contact with infected animal material (body fluids or tissues) or through bites from infected mosquitoes. RVFV has also caused serious infections in laboratory workers and must be handled with biosafety and biocontainment measures. [There is a 7 Jan 2019 report stating that there are 2 documented cases of infected human fetuses. One infant was born with an enlarged liver and spleen, among other symptoms; the other died within a week. Because the disease can be asymptomatic in pregnant women, many more cases of abnormalities and stillbirths may have been misidentified. Mod.TY

Rainfall facilitates mosquito eggs to hatch. _Aedes_ mosquitoes acquire the virus from feeding on infected animals, and may potentially vertically transmit the virus so that new generations of infected mosquitoes may hatch from their eggs. This provides a potential mechanism for maintaining the virus in nature, as the eggs of these mosquitoes may survive for periods of up to several years in dry conditions. Once livestock is infected, a wide variety of mosquito species may act as the vector for transmission of RVFV and can spread the disease.

Low level RVF activity may take place during inter-epizootic periods. RVF should be suspected when exceptional flooding and subsequent abundant mosquito populations are followed by the occurrence of abortions, together with fatal disease marked by necrosis and hemorrhages in the liver that particularly affect newborn lambs, kids and calves, potentially concurrent with the occurrence of an influenza-like illness in farm workers and people handling raw meat.

The current wet season in East Africa has been characterized by heavy rains and flooding, which enhance suitable ecological conditions for RVF vectors' amplification, increasing the risk of RVF occurrence. Recent suitability maps for RVF vector amplification, produced by FAO, showed a suitability pattern very similar to the one observed during the period September 2006-December 2007, a period that was characterized by abnormal, heavy rains and flooding, which were followed by a major epizootic and epidemic in the region.

One hopes that these 2 reported cases are not an indication of a coming repeat of the 2018 RVF outbreak with threats to both human and animal health. - Mod.TY
