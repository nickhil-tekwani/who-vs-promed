Unlucky ducks died of botulism
-----------------------------
14 ducks that turned up dead in Garden Lakes on 4 Oct 2004 were the
victims of botulism. The finding, made by the University of Arizona's
(UA) Veterinary, Diagnostic and Toxicology Department, dispels
suspicions that the animals had become targets of foul play.
"Initially, it looked like the ducks got ill and died very quickly,
which normally would have been an indication of poisoning," Avondale
Animal Control Officer Racelle Carlson said. "The problem was I'm not
sure how closely people paid attention to the ducks before they died.
Obviously, they could have overlooked something when the ducks were
swimming around the lake."
The ducks, which were among hundreds that make the Avondale
community's North Lake [west Phoenix metro area] their home, met
their fate sometime between 3 Oct and 4 Oct 2004. Garden Lakes
Property Manager Dick Schinke said most of the dead ducks, which were
bleeding from their bills, were found floating in the 20-acre lake.
Moldy bread was probably to blame
Schinke said that, while he is still upset over the "deeply troubling
sight," he is pleased with the UA's conclusion. "At least we know
there is no one out there purposely trying to kill our ducks," he
said. "The thought that someone might have been doing that was pretty
disturbing."
Instead, Carlson said, "the culprits were regular people, maybe even
duck lovers, who likely thought they were being good Samaritans.
Botulism usually comes from moldy old bread or popcorn, the things
that people feed to ducks all the time," she said.
"When they ingest it, they become very ill and often die. Apparently
we do not get sick from it, but here are animals that are very
susceptible to a lot of different small -- at least what we see as
small -- infections and viruses that are fatal to them." Of 2 ducks
that were found to be clinging to life, one is currently being nursed
back to health "and is doing just fine," Carlson said. The other was
too ill and had to be euthanized, she said.
Originally, investigators thought the ducks might have been poisoned
because the deaths were confined to the boat ramp area of the lake,
which is southeast of 115th Avenue and Indian School Road. But,
Avondale spokeswoman Pier Simeri said it is now believed the 14 ducks
had laid claim to that area, which is why other ducks were unaffected
by the tainted food. "Somebody went out and put the bread right there
by the dock, and the ducks that stay there ate it," Carlson said. "I
doubt they had any idea they were hurting the ducks."
Botulism isn't the only ill effect brought on by feeding waterfowl.
Carlson said providing food to the ducks often results in a
disruption of their migratory lifestyle. "These are migrating birds,"
she said. "Every year, they go to different cities, they go to
different states. But, when we start feeding them, that's
interrupted. Who wants to leave a place where they know they're going
to be fed all the time? We have to let nature do its thing."
Unfortunately, Schinke said, little can be done to enforce the
no-feeding policy at North Lake or anywhere else for that matter.
"We've had signs telling people not to feed the ducks up forever," he
said. "Other than that, the best thing we can do is try to educate
the public on the dangers of feeding wildlife. There's certainly no
law against it."
The lesson to be learned from this experience, Carlson said, is
"wildlife is beautiful, but we need to leave it alone. It's kind of
like with coyotes," she said. "I get calls all the time about
coyotes. I ask, is it sick or injured? No, it's just running across
my yard. Well, we're in the desert. That's where they live, and they
lived here long before we did. We have to cohabitate with them."
She added, "Think about what just happened. Somebody by no means had
any intention of harming these animals, but, if they hadn't fed them,
they probably wouldn't be dead right now."

[Avian botulism will occur where the conditions are favorable.
The sporulating anaerobic gram-positive bacillus _C. botulinum_
elaborates 7 types of antigenically distinct neurotoxins, 4 of which
affect humans: type A, B, E, or rarely type F. Toxin types A and B
are highly poisonous proteins resistant to digestion by GI enzymes.
Approximately 50 percent of foodborne outbreaks in the USA are caused
by type A toxin, followed by types B and E.
Type C botulism occurs principally in waterfowl, and in other birds
living in an aquatic environment, and causes tremendous losses, most
notably in waterfowl in the western US. In addition to North America,
it has been reported in birds in Europe, South Africa, Uruguay, and
Australia.
In the Great Lakes region, it was 1st identified in 1936 in ducks on
Green Bay of Lake Michigan and, in 1941, in Monroe County marshes
along Lake Erie. Type C is most often associated with limberneck
paralysis in birds.
Type E botulism is connected with consumption of fish and occurs
mainly in gulls and loons, and, to a lesser extent, in mergansers,
mute swans, grebes, and shorebirds. It now appears that any birds or
mammals susceptible to botulinum toxin run a risk of becoming
poisoned if they scavenge dead fish. Evidence for this includes the
identification of type E toxin in a bald eagle, wood ducks, and
muskrats with fish remaining in their digestive tracts.
_C. botulinum_ spores are relatively heat-resistant, though high
temperatures and/or exposure to moist heat will kill the spores.
Toxins, on the other hand, are readily destroyed by heat and by
cooking food. Toxin production (especially type E) can occur at
temperatures as low as 3 degrees C (37.4 degrees F), i.e. inside a
refrigerator, and does not require strict anaerobic conditions.
Human illness from Type E is most often associated with improperly
smoked fish. Since the toxin is destroyed by heat, it appears that no
problem with botulism will result from eating cooked waterfowl. -
