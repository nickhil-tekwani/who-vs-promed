Cases of malaria among UK travellers rise by 30 percent
-------------------------------------------------------
The number of malaria infections recorded among UK residents has
increased by nearly 30 percent over the past 2 years. New figures from
the Health Protection Agency (HPA) reveal there were 1761 new cases in
2010. Over the past decade most infections have occurred among people
who visited West Africa or South Asia.

***The HPA is warning travellers to heed advice on how to avoid
malaria, which is the world's 2nd biggest killer.

In 2008 there were 1370 new cases but the following year the numbers
increased to 1495. In 2010, almost 40 percent of UK residents who
contracted the disease had visited either Nigeria or Ghana, while 11
percent had been to India.

The HPA believes these travellers may not have sought or were unable
to access advice on malaria prevention or had not thought they were at
risk because they knew the area they were travelling to. And these
kinds of travellers appear to be more at risk because they generally
stay for longer than other visitors, such as those on business. "It
is a myth that people who have had malaria will not get it again" says
Dr Jane Jones.

They also tend to stay with friends and family rather than in hotels
or resorts, and so are exposed to the same risk of contracting the
disease as local people.

Professor Peter Chiodini, who heads the HPA's malaria reference
laboratory, said the figures - released on World Malaria Day - are a
timely reminder for travellers to take precautions against the
disease.

"Anyone who is travelling to a country where malaria is present
should take travel advice and appropriate medication. Even people
living in Britain visiting the country in which they were born or grew
up, or have previously visited, are not immune from malaria and should
take precautions."

Malaria is a devastating disease in the developing world, accounting
for 20 percent of childhood deaths in Africa. Malaria is spread by
mosquitoes in tropical areas but it cannot be transmitted directly
from person to person. The symptoms include a flu-like illness, fever,
shaking, headache, muscle aches and tiredness, as well as nausea,
vomiting, and diarrhoea.

Dr Jane Jones, head of the HPA's travel and migrant health section,
says while malaria is a potentially deadly disease, it is also one
that is almost completely preventable. "Anyone who is planning to
travel to a tropical destination should always seek advice from their
GP or travel health clinic before their trip. It is a myth that people
who have had malaria will not get it again. Our advice is the same for
all travelers: you must take anti-mosquito precautions and medication
to keep safe."

Malaria facts
-------------
- There are several different types of malaria, but most deaths are
caused by _Plasmodium falciparum_
- Malaria is the world's second biggest killer after tuberculosis
- Malaria is spread by mosquito bites
- It cannot be spread directly from human to human
- A billion of the world's population is at risk
- In 2008, 247 million cases of malaria with almost 1 million deaths
were recorded
- The societies and economic development of the world's poorest
nations are severely affected

[The article refers to the data available at the HPA website
(http://www.hpa.org.uk/web/HPAweb&HPAwebStandard/HPAweb_C/1195733773780)
showing an overall increase in imported malaria cases, but the number
of cases equals the number in 2006 (1758) and it is still lower than
any year from 1993-2002.

_Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria was imported mainly from Ghana and
Nigeria, which are highly endemic countries. This primarily reflects
that persons from Ghana and Nigeria living the UK often travel without
realizing the need for malaria prophylaxis.

The increase in malaria from India is surprising. Recent reviews have
suggested that visitors to India should not be prescribed malaria
prophylaxis. In "Malaria prophylaxis policy for travellers from Europe
to the Indian Subcontinent" (RH Behrens et al. Malar J. 2006 Feb 1;
5:7; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1373639/), the
authors concluded that non-selective prescribing of chemoprophylaxis
for visitors to India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka should be
dropped. There have been several postings in ProMED-mail on both _P.
falciparum_ and _P. vivax_ malaria in India. The present UK data could
be caused by changing travel patterns but could also reflect an
increased risk. - Mod.EP]
