African swine fever virus (ASFV) has broken out in Chinsali and Isoka districts of Muchinga Province killing about 1580 pigs.

African swine fever is a highly contagious haemorrhagic disease with a high mortality rate in pigs.

Minister of Livestock and Fisheries Michael Katambo said in an interview that Government has since sent a team of experts from the veterinary department to determine the type of virus.

Mr Katambo said the experts will also have to do a thorough head count of how many pigs have been killed by the disease before devising measures on how to reduce its impact on the poor farmers.

He said the disease could have broken out because of the uncontrolled movement of livestock from one area to another. Mr Katambo said the disease has no vaccine and that the only solution is to burn the carcasses and also to put in place stringent measures to control the movement of livestock in the province. "Yes, I can confirm that we have an outbreak of African swine fever in Muchinga province. Unfortunately, we have no vaccine for the virus," he said. Mr Katambo said Government will have to see how the farmers that have lost their pigs can be compensated, working in partnership with co-operating partners that are promoting livestock farming in the area.

And livestock farmers in Chinsali and Isoka districts have expressed sadness over the outbreak of the ASFV in the district and have appealed to Government to help them restock their animals.

Adam Mulenga livestock cooperative chairperson Lameck Simwinga said in an interview yesterday [21 Jul 2017] that about 1580 pigs have been wiped out in Chinsali and Nakonde by the virus.

[As apparent from Zambia's OIE immediate notification of 26 Apr 2017 and from Mod.CRD's accompanying commentary, ASF has been recorded, since 2016, from certain zone(s)/region(s) in the Eastern and Northern provinces. From the current media report it appears that the virus is now circulating also in the province located between the Northern and Eastern provinces, namely Muchinga province. For Zambia's administrative map see http://tinyurl.com/y9rpjguy.

The following comment, received in early May 2017 from an EpiCore Global Surveillance Project member (20170502.5008477), is applicable also for the current spread of the virus noted in Zambia:

"Depopulation is rarely used as a control measure when outbreaks affect rural communities; this is largely due to the fear of a public outcry and possibly political backlash. Movement ban of affected livestock out of the province is usually the preferred control measure. However, on commercial farms, depopulation is usually carried out as most farms are usually covered by insurance and it is easy for the government to pay compensation to such enterprises." - Mod.AS
