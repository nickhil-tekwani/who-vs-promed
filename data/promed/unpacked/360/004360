Plague, pet prairie dogs - USA (Texas) 980710224535

A request for help from the zoonosis experts on the list:
A 7 year-old child was bitten on the finger today by a prairie dog in a
West Texas community. The animal resides in a prairie dog town within the
city limits. The child and his friends were trying to help/feed the animal
because it was "sick." It is not normal behavior for the animals in this
colony to allow themselves to be fed by humans. "Sick" is not further
defined. The animal was not captured at the time of the incident and likely
has "gone to ground."
As best I can determine, this would appear to be a low risk exposure with
respect to rabies, however I did find a few references about rodent rabies;
they do not mention prairie dogs. In addition, the county where the bite
occurred should be north of the Texas Department of Health's drop zone for
oral rabies vaccine. We do have a significant problem with rabies in the
state, especially in the southern portion.
Problem number two is that we have had plague reported in prairie dogs in
the region, although geographically separate from where the incident
occurred by at least 100 miles. This was the subject of a previous
ProMED-mail posting.
My inclination is to not give rabies prophylaxis, but would be re-assured
by the agreement of my colleagues; I would be interested in any comments
regarding rodent rabies. The references I was able to find on the subject
are not immediately available.
Problem number 2 is whether or not to worry about plague, and if there is a
worry, what to do about it. My inclination here is to follow expectantly,
but I am the first to admit that I am by no means an expert in prophylactic
treatment for _Y. pestis_. The information I have been able to pull is at
best sparse.

[From Larry's sparse information, it would appear that this child lives up
in the Texas panhandle in the northwest which abuts onto Colorado and New
Mexico. If so it is certainly well north of the endemic rabies area of
Texas, roughly from central Texas westwards to the Mexican border and to
the south west. This has been copied to every rabies person in Texas I know
of and plus others in TDH for their input. My inclination is that this is
not a rabies exposure. But what might explain these prairie rodents
appearing to be "sick" at this time? The first human I ever treated as a
veterinarian was a little girl that was playing outside the veterinary
clinic, while her parents were inside with the family dog, and the child
poked its finger down a short gopher hole and got bitten by the frightened
animal ... there was an explosion of gophers at that time. They were
everywhere. So "sick" wildlife in my experience can be anything from
normality observed by the inexperienced to outright clinical disease.
Comments from those better informed than I are welcomed. - Mod.MHJ
