At least four more people and 70 per cent of poultry in Hong Kong have been
exposed to a new strain of bird flu virus which infected two girls in
March, it was announced yesterday. But health officials insisted influenza
A H9N2 posed "no imminent threat" to people and medical experts stressed
the chances of the virus causing an outbreak in humans were very slim.
There has been no new H9N2 human infection case since the virus of pure
avian nature attacked two girls, aged one and four, in March.
Both infected girls recovered after running a high fever and showing
typical flu symptoms.
Another strain of bird flu, H5N1, infected 18 people, killing six of them
in 1997.
Studies revealed yesterday showed two per cent of 100 poultry workers
tested were found to have antibodies to the H9N2 virus, compared with only
0.6 per cent of the 500 members of the general population surveyed.
The studies, jointly conducted by the Department of Health and United
States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, tested 733 people in
Hong Kong to find out if they had been exposed to the virus.
They found 70 per cent of poultry sold locally had been exposed to the
virus, renewing the call for central slaughtering in the SAR.
A nurse, who was not involved in the care of the two H9N2 patients, a blood
donor and two poultry workers were found to have the antibody to the virus.
Five mainlanders were infected with the virus before it infected the two
girls in Hong Kong. The mainlanders showed only very mild flu symptoms.
The Department of Health's community medicine consultant, Dr Mak Kwok-hang,
warned yesterday that although the main mode of transmission of the virus
was from birds to humans, the possibility of human-to-human transmission
remained open.
"[The H9N2 virus causes relatively mild illness in humans and poses no
imminent major threat to public health. There is no cause for undue alarm.
"However, we should not be complacent as the influenza virus is capable of
changing."
Only one out of 233 people who might have come into contact with the two
girls infected in March has the antibody.
None of the two girls' relatives, classmates or teachers has the antibody.
Dr Mak said it was safe to consume poultry as long as it was thoroughly
cooked.
The four-year-old girl was believed to have contracted the virus through 11
days of contact with live chickens at her grandparents' home. But the
source of infection for the one-year-old girl remains a mystery.
University of Hong Kong microbiologist Professor Yuen Kwok-yung said last
night the chances of H9N2 causing an outbreak were minimal.
Professor Yuen said to cause infection, the virus had to invade human cells
after reacting with human enzymes.
Gene sequencing results show the structure of the H5N1 virus means it can
easily get into human cells.

[This further information, though still incomplete, confirms what was
suspected about the two human cases of H9N2 infection, namely that they
probably resulted from "dead end" transmission of avian viruses encountered
during epizootic or enzootic circulation. The prevalence rate of H9N2
antibody in poultry workers (2% of a small sample of 100) is lower than
reports from elsewhere in China, but still consistent with "dead end"
spillover of avian virus into human populations as an occasional or common
event. That these two viruses are avian, that there was no evidence of
human-to-human transmission, and that persons with antibody apparently had
not had serious influenza-like illnesses, was expected but still
reassuring. These public health studies, in conjunction with studies on the
H5N1 outbreak two years ago, add to our understanding of the ecology of the
influenza A viruses. - Mod.DM
