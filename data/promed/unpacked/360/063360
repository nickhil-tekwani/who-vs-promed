Mali tries to trace 343 contacts in 2nd Ebola wave
--------------------------------------------------
Mali is trying to trace as many as 343 people linked to confirmed and probable Ebola victims in an effort to control its 2nd Ebola outbreak, health officials said on Friday [14 Nov 2014].

An initial batch of contacts linked to a 2 year old from Guinea who died of Ebola last month [October 2014] were close to the end of their 21-day quarantine period when Mali confirmed a 2nd, separate batch of cases this week. There have been at least 4 more confirmed Ebola cases in this 2nd episode, all linked to an imam who entered Mali from neighboring Guinea and died late last month with Ebola-like symptoms that were not recognized; 3 of these have died so far...

In a sign of growing concern over the new wave of cases, the French government on Friday updated its website to advise against all but essential travel to Bamako and Kayes, the western region where the girl died.

Second batch of AU medical team arrives for Ebola battle
--------------------------------------------------------
A high-powered African Union (AU) Assistance Team has arrived in Liberia from across East and West Africa to assist in the fight against the Ebola disease ravaging West Africa. The team, comprising 28 medical professionals including doctors and clinicians, will serve under the African Union Support to Ebola Outbreak in West Africa (ASEOWA)...

Speaking shortly upon arrival at the weekend at the Roberts International Airport (RIA) in Margibi County, the head of the AU team, Maj Gen Dr Julius F Oketta said the AU team will be deployed in the 3 hardest-hit countries with its headquarters situated in Liberia... Oketta said the team's mission will cover 3 phases, including providing training, epidemiology and psychosocial support to the population...

[3] West Africa: annual migration in search of work, threat

Migrations in West Africa seen as challenge to stopping Ebola
-------------------------------------------------------------
In much of West Africa, the annual harvest ends around October, and in the following months, countless young men hit the road to look for work elsewhere, such as on cocoa and coffee plantations in Ivory Coast or in fishing ports on the coast, according to people who know the region.

That post-harvest migration is a prime example of the high mobility of the region's population. National borders are porous ... and people cross them freely, by all accounts. And that fact worries some observers who are pondering the challenge of stopping the Ebola epidemic simmering in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.

With a high level of travel between the 3 hard-hit countries and their neighbors, these observers reason, there's a very good chance that travelers or migrants will bring more Ebola cases into other countries, such as Senegal, Mali, and Cote d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast), potentially triggering expansion of the epidemic...

It would be good for those [Sahelian] countries to be warning people over the radio not to come down to Liberia this year [2014]. And people do have radios -- it's amazing how much communication there is...

[This is a long, detailed explanation of the annual migration from Sahelian countries after the harvest [which ended in October 2014] to coastal regions of West Africa by unemployed youth in search of work. They will return home by April [2015], potentially carrying Ebola virus disease with them.

Radio is the most widespread and popular form of media in Liberia and Sierra Leone, where upwards of 80 per cent of households have access to a radio (http://reliefweb.int/report/liberia/school-lessons-radio-sierra-leone-liberia). These are both English-speaking countries. Perhaps radios are not as common in French-speaking countries like Guinea and Mali? In any case, radio does not seem to have raised public awareness about Ebola in Mali. - Mod.JW]

Israel has sent medical shipments including mobile clinics to 3 African countries to help combat the spread of the Ebola virus. The mobile field hospitals and medical cargo are expected to arrive by ship in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea in about a month. The equipment sent includes protective gear, a treatment cart and the full medical equipment required for setting up the clinics.

[5] Gambia: re-opens its border to Ebola-affected nations
Date: Fri 14 Nov 2014
Source: StarAfrica, APA (Agence Africaine de Presse) report [edited]
http://en.starafrica.com/news/the-gambia-re-opens-its-border-to-ebola-affected-nations.html


The head of disease control in the Gambia, Sanna Sambou, has confirmed the reopening of the country's border to countries affected by the deadly Ebola virus, APA reported on Friday [14 Nov 2014]. Mr Sambou noted that border closure was not the best solution to contain the virus, hence the need to reopen borders to allow in and out movement of people between the Gambia and countries affected by Ebola. According to media reports, the issue of border closure, as a result of the outbreak of the disease, was deemed discriminatory and unworthy by the World Health Organisation (WHO), adding that it should be considered a global pandemic.

Despite the restoration of the border crossing, however, Sambou said the health authorities are poised to continue on the thorough screening of people moving into the country from Ebola hit nations. It could be recalled the Gambia in September [2014] announced that it would no longer be granting entrance to Guineans, Liberians, Nigerians or Sierra Leoneans, due to fear of the disease getting into the country.

[6] Sierra Leone: UK lab cuts delay for Ebola test results

Britain slashes wait for Ebola test results in Sierra Leone
-----------------------------------------------------------
British scientists in Sierra Leone say they have cut the delay for Ebola test results from 9 days to 2, hailing a significant gain in fighting the outbreak. The poor country is one of the hardest hit in an epidemic that has claimed more than 5000 lives in west Africa. Early diagnosis is deemed a key means of controlling the spread of the virus. The British government opened a laboratory in October [2014] next to a UK-funded treatment centre in Kerry Town, western Sierra Leone, doubling the nation's testing capacity.

"It's making a huge difference for the country. We have 12 people who work hard here every day and others arrive regularly," laboratory head David Simpson told AFP on Thursday [13 Nov 2014] at the tented encampment. "We will have 16 reinforcements in another 2 weeks. Our capacity will increase and this is key in the fight against this disease." Scientists at the site test blood samples and swabs for the virus and can give the all-clear for Ebola patients who survive the disease. Simpson said results for possible Ebola infections used to take up to 9 days but were now being delivered in 48-72 hours thanks to the laboratory....

Britain pledged GBP 20 million (USD 30 million, EUR 25 million) to build and run the Kerry Town laboratory, as well as 2 others being constructed at British treatment centres in Port Loko and Makeni. Once operational, the laboratories will quadruple the number of tests that can be conducted every day, further reducing waiting times. The cash is part of Britain's GBL 225 million [about USD 360 million] commitment to its Ebola response, which includes providing 700 treatment beds across its former colony.

[7] Guinea: Ebola sabotages anti-malaria fight

Ebola sabotages Guinea's anti-malaria fight
-------------------------------------------
The Ebola epidemic in Guinea is seriously compromising the fight against malaria, its government said. In scores of cases, doctors are confusing malaria with Ebola, delaying the right life-saving treatment. Guinea's government committee against malaria said many of the undocumented deaths suspected of being from Ebola may actually be from malaria. This presents an even deadlier situation in a country that WHO has ranked among the 10 nations with the highest malaria mortality rates.

Guinea's national coordinator for the fight against malaria, Dr Timothy Guilavogui, said malaria each year affects 44 per cent of Guineans, or about 5 million people. The disease kills at least 10 people in Guinea every week, he said. In contrast, the Ebola outbreak -- which began in Guinea in December [2014] -- has infected fewer than 2000 people in the country and caused close to 1200 deaths, according to WHO. Guilavogui said Ebola is eroding Guinea's recent gains in which the malaria mortality rate had fallen by 50 per cent. The main problem is that malaria and Ebola share similar symptoms initially, including high fever, nausea and vomiting. Only blood tests can distinguish between them. But fear of Ebola is keeping sick people away from needed care, Guilavogui said...

[8] Liberia: new German-funded Ebola center

1st patients being treated in new German-funded Ebola center
------------------------------------------------------------
Ebola patients in Liberia can now be treated in a new center set up in Monrovia with funding from German aid organizations. A German armed forces airlift will keep supplies flowing in. As the battle against Ebola intensifies in Liberia, a new treatment center built largely with funding from German Medical Aid Organization (medeor) has now gone into operation. The organization International Search and Rescue Germany (ISAR Germany) also contributed by taking care of customs formalities and ensuring the facility could be handed over to the Liberian government in full working order. The center expands a Liberian government Ebola treatment unit and adds to the growing number of isolation wards being set up to combat the virus.

Located on the outskirts of the Liberian capital Monrovia, the center -- which consists of 2 isolation wards -- was constructed largely thanks to the efforts of Margret Gieraths-Nimene, a German doctor who has lived and worked in Liberia for many years and is actively engaged in the fight against Ebola. Shortly after the wards were installed, Gieraths-Nimene showed a team of German military and medical staff round the new facility...

[9] Liberia: food markets still closed

Food markets still closed in Liberia's bread basket region
----------------------------------------------------------
The main market in Foya, a town in northern Liberia, has been closed for 6 months now. Most of the others in the surrounding Lofa County were also ordered to stop trading in recent months. The scene is heart-breaking. Rotting wooden tables, weeds growing between them, and kids playing in the deserted alleys while singing anti-Ebola songs. Lofa County is considered the epicenter of the Ebola outbreak in Liberia. This region, near the borders with both Sierra Leone and Guinea, is where everything started. It also is considered as Liberia's breadbasket, the main rice-producing region.

The Ebola outbreak hit Liberia in waves. In Foya, the disease came in June [2014], when the farmers should have been planting the rice. "Every day you would see dead bodies being transported on the road," Mary Wagbo says. "We were terribly frightened, we did not get out of the house." As a result, Mary and her family planted late. Now they are busy hand-picking the rice, but this year's crop will not feed the family for a year. "If you plant the rice late in the season, it will be water-stressed and therefore produce less," Alghassim Wurie, WFP Liberia deputy country director, explains. "As most rural farmers rely on rain-fed farming, the yield will be affected." Growing rice is very labour-intensive. In Liberia, many farmers are used to working together, using all available hands to take care of the fields. Once the work -- be it planting, or weeding -- is done on one farm, all the workers move together to the next one. But it didn't happen this year as people were afraid of gathering in large groups...
