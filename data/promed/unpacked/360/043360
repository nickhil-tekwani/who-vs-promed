Additional information African Swine Fever- Mozambique (Maputo) and some
corrections.
African Swine Fever (ASF) is endemic in Mozambique since 1960. The first
outbreak in the southern provinces of Maputo, Gaza and Inhambane occurred
in 1994. The first detection was in March 1994 at the campus of the
Veterinary Faculty/Veterinary Research Institute in a small unit kept for
training purposes.
The present outbreak is a continuation of a series of outbreaks since 1994.
In fact since its first appearance in 1994 in the south of the country the
disease was never contained. The disease was detected again in the same
unit this year (1999) on the 16th of February . The unit was sealed and all
the 26 pigs slaughtered and incinerated. All material from the facilities
was incinerated and the building disinfected according to established
procedures. The unit seems to work as a sentinel herd because it is
situated in the premises of veterinary institutions were all deaths and
diseases in resident animals are thoroughly investigated.
A retrospective study carried out in 1994 revealed that the disease was
introduced into the unit by a worker that regularly attended a commercial
unit in the suburbs of Maputo. Furthermore, it was proved the disease was
present and spreading in the south since December 1993. Massive deaths of
pigs were reported in December 1993 and January 1994 in Inhambane province
and the disease was confirmed in samples from the 17th of January 1994.
Unfortunately the results of the tests were sent back to the province only
on the 12th of April 1994. In the first 3 months of 1994 132 pigs from the
infected areas of the province of Inhambane (Morrumbene and Pande) were
transferred to Maputo. This number was twice as many the number of pigs
than the previous year. This seems that pig owners tried to get rid of pigs
from the region before they died.
The disease might have been introduced in the province of Inhambane with
pigs originating from endemic areas of Tete province.Between 1993 and 1995
there were 201 outbreaks with 41% confirmed by laboratory tests (direct
imunofluorescence and Contra-electroimunoforesis). The late detection of
the first outbreak of the disease in the South of Mozambique seemed to be
the result of the knowledge about the disease in the south and the weak
surveillance activities.
The control activities carried out during all this period were very
insufficient. Stamping out and movement control was not used consistently
and the situation tended to worsen when the number of animals (density)
increased after recovery from the big outbreaks. Between 1992 and 1994
Maputo province had a reduction of the population of pigs of 71.2%. In 1992
there were a total of 26,798 in 1993:14,878 and in 1994:428,720. More than
62% of the pig farmers lost all their animals. At this rate and with the
control measures being applied the pig farming industry in southern
Mozambique will be destroyed. Unfortunately it seems that the matter was
not taken seriously by the authorities until recently.
