Disease outbreaks reported, 18 May 1999
Latest information from the coordination committee in Durba*
One additional case of Marburg fever has how been confirmed, bringing the
total to 3 (the first confirmed case being the medical officer who died on
23 April). To date, 93 suspected cases of viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF)
have been reported.
The exact number of deaths due to [VHF has not been established, owing to
the lack of precise information about the clinical picture of those who
have died during the past several months. Previously, over 60 deaths had
been attributed to the disease, but it is presently difficult, and may be
impossible, to accurately determine the proportion due to haemorrhagic
fever. All three confirmed Marburg cases have died.
Of the 2 new cases, 1 was a woman who died on 7 May. She reportedly had
lived 20-30 km from Durba, and preliminary investigation has not
established a link with other haemorrhagic fever cases or with mining
activities. Additional data about this case are being collected.
On 17 May, the National Institute for Virology (South Africa) reported the
confirmation of the third Marburg case, a miner who died on 13 May. This is
the first death in a miner, linking Marburg fever with the cluster of
deaths previously reported among the gold miners.
A broad serological survey among the population of the affected area began
on 17 May, and an isolation unit was set up in Watsa in addition to the
unit in Durba. Cases are being actively followed up in Durba, and an
intensive public information campaign is under way. The surveillance and
advance warning systems in the province are being reinforced. In addition,
an ecological team* has started collecting specimens from animals for
virological studies.
*The coordination committee is composed of experts from: the Ministry of
Health and local health authorities; WHO headquarters and the African
Region; UNDP; Medecins sans frontieres (Belgium and Holland); Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (United States); Institut Pasteur (France,
French Guiana and Madagascar); Institute of Tropical Medicine (Belgium).
The ecological team is composed of experts from the National Institute for
Virology (South Africa) and the Pest Infection Laboratory (Denmark).
