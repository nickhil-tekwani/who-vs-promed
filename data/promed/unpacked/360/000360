The Biden administration today [19 Jan 2022] confirmed officials will make available and free to the public 400 million N95 respirators to be distributed at community health centers and pharmacies across the country. The news follows yesterday's [18 Jan 2022] launch of a website through which Americans could order up to 4 free COVID-19 tests per household. The respirators will be sent out beginning later this week.

The N95s come from the Strategic National Stockpile and are known to filter out 95% or more of airborne particles when fitted properly. Early in the pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) discouraged the use of respirators by the public because they were in short supply for medical personnel. CDC updated that guidance earlier this week [w/e 23 Jan 2022], saying that Americans should wear the most protective masks or respirators available to them.

The CDC Nowcast estimates that the omicron variant accounts for 99.5% of new COVID-19 cases in the US, and because it is more transmissible than previous variants, mask mandates are once again being put in place in cities across the country. https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions

Almost 1 million child cases
--------------------------
From [6 Jan to 13 Jan 2022], more than 981 000 child COVID-19 cases were reported in the United States, according to the latest weekly update from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), marking a 69% increase from the previous week https://www.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/children-and-covid-19-state-level-data-report/.

COVID-19 infection, vaccines both protect against delta
-------------------------------------------------------
Today [19 Jan 2022] CDC published a study in its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report showing that COVID-19 patients infected with the delta variant fared better if they had a previous COVID-19 infection or were vaccinated, compared with unvaccinated patients who had never been infected with COVID-19. The study was conducted on patients in New York and California, who were grouped into cohorts based on vaccination status and previous infection, and tracked between May 2021 and November 2021. Delta became the dominant strain in both states by July of last year [2021].

"Before delta became the predominant variant in June [2021], case rates were higher among persons who survived a previous infection than persons who were vaccinated alone. By early October [2021], persons who survived a previous infection had lower case rates than persons who were vaccinated alone," the authors wrote. [León TM, Dorabawila V, Nelson L, et al. COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations by COVID-19 vaccination status and previous COVID-19 diagnosis -- California and New York, May-November 2021. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. ePub: 19 January 2022. doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7104e1]

The authors cautioned that any conclusions on prior immunity and vaccination effectiveness could not be applied to the current surge of cases caused by omicron. The CDC COVID Data Tracker shows 63% of Americans are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, 75.1% have received at least one dose of vaccine, and 38.7% of vaccinated Americans have received a booster dose. https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total

[2] Nocebo effect

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/01/most-side-effects-noted-covid-vaccine-trials-may-be-due-nocebo-effect


More than a third of participants in COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials who received a placebo reported adverse events (AEs) such as headache and fatigue and contributed to the "nocebo effect", potentially rendering 76% of all AE reports after the first dose not true AEs, according to a meta-analysis yesterday [18 Jan 2022] in JAMA Network Open. [Haas JW, Bender FL, Ballou S, et al. Frequency of adverse events in the placebo arms of COVID-19 vaccine trials. A systematic review and meta-analysis. JAMA Netw Open. 2022;5(1):e2143955. doi: https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.43955]

Researchers from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) in Boston and their US and German colleagues analyzed 12 articles published up to 14 Jul 2021, on randomized clinical vaccine trials involving 22 802 vaccine recipients and 22 578 placebo recipients.

The nocebo effect happens when a trial participant develops side effects or symptoms simply because the person expects they'll occur after taking a drug or vaccine. The authors of the meta-analysis used a ratio of reported AEs in the 2 groups to calculate the nocebo effect in COVID vaccine trials.

Trials involving participants 16 years and older were included in the analysis if they evaluated AEs within 7 days of injection, included a placebo group, and provided separate AE reports for the vaccine and placebo groups. The trials studied different types of COVID-19 vaccines (mRNA, viral vector, or protein-based) and were in different phases at the time of the study.

Lower AE rates with placebo after 2 doses
-----------------------------------------
Systemic AEs were reported by 35.2% of placebo recipients after the 1st dose, with headache (19.3%) and fatigue (16.7%) being the commonest; after the 2nd dose, 16.2% reported headache, and 14.9% fatigue. In comparison, 46.3% of vaccine recipients reported at least one systemic AE after the 1st dose.

After the 2nd dose, systemic AEs were reported at lower rates in the placebo group (31.8%) but at higher rates in the vaccine group (61.4%). Odds ratios between the 2 groups were -0.47 (standardized mean difference, -0.26) after the 1st dose and -1.36 (standardized mean difference, -0.75) after the 2nd.

Local AEs (for example, pain at the injection site) were reported by 16.2% of placebo recipients and 66.7% of vaccine recipients after the 1st dose and 11.8% and 72.8%, respectively, after 2 doses.

"The ratios between the placebo and vaccine AE proportions suggest that after the 1st vaccine dose, nocebo responses accounted for 76.0% of systemic AEs and 24.3% of local AEs," the study authors wrote. After the 2nd dose, the nocebo effect accounted for 51.8% of systemic AEs and 16.2% of local AEs.

An exploratory analysis of the 2 largest trials reporting information on AE severity showed that the placebo and vaccine groups reported similar severity grades after the 1st dose but that more vaccine recipients reported moderate and severe AEs after the 2nd.

Results could help address vaccine hesitancy
--------------------------------------------
In a BIDMC press release, the researchers said that nocebo responses are common in randomized clinical trials. The commonest AEs, such as headache and fatigue, are mentioned in the leaflets given to vaccine trial volunteers, according to Ted Kaptchuk, director of BIDMC's Program in Placebo Studies. [https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/940270] "Evidence suggests that this sort of information may cause people to misattribute common daily background sensations as arising from the vaccine or cause anxiety and worry that make people hyper alert to bodily feelings about adverse events," he said.

But while Kaptchuk said that some researchers may believe that disclosing potential adverse effects of an intervention can cause harm, it is the ethical thing to do. "Medicine is based on trust," he said. "Our findings lead us to suggest that informing the public about the potential for nocebo responses could help reduce worries about COVID-19 vaccination, which might decrease vaccination hesitancy."

[In medical studies, a control group is typically given an inert substance (usually a sugar pill) that provides a baseline to which researchers can compare the effectiveness of the new medicine being tested. The members of this group are told that the placebo is real and, surprisingly, they sometimes experience an improvement in their symptoms, simply because they expect that the medicine will make them feel better.

An opposite tendency -- and one that has been largely overlooked by the research community -- is the nocebo effect. Put simply, it is the phenomenon in which inert substances or mere suggestions of substances actually bring about negative effects in a patient or research participant. For some, being informed of a pill or procedure's potential side effects is enough to bring on real-life symptoms. Like the placebo effect, it is still poorly understood and thought to be brought about by a combination of Pavlovian conditioning and a reaction to expectations. [https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/what-is-the-nocebo-effect-5451823/

An earlier review article on the nocebo effect is Häuser W, Hansen E, Enck P: Nocebo phenomena in medicine: their relevance in everyday clinical practice. Dtsch Arztebl Int 2012; 109(26): 459-65. doi: https://doi.org/10.3238/arztebl.2012.0459. These authors concluded: "Physicians face an ethical dilemma, as they are required not just to inform patients of the potential complications of treatment, but also to minimize the likelihood of these complications, i.e., to avoid inducing them through the potential nocebo effect of thorough patient information. Possible ways out of the dilemma include emphasizing the fact that the proposed treatment is usually well-tolerated, or else getting the patient's permission to inform less than fully about its possible side effects. Communication training in medical school, residency training, and continuing medical education would be desirable so that physicians can better exploit the power of words to patients' benefit, rather than their detriment." - Mod.LK]

[3] Universal coronavirus vaccine
Date: Wed 19 Jan 2022
Source: National Geographic [edited]
https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/is-a-universal-coronavirus-vaccine-on-the-horizon


Scientists are racing to develop a single vaccine that protects against many SARS-CoV-2 variants, as well as emerging coronaviruses with the potential to trigger a new pandemic. Every time a new variant comes along, COVID-19 vaccine and drug makers reassess their "recipes" to see if they work against an evolving virus -- like omicron, which has spread quickly around the globe in little more than a month.

Since the start of the pandemic in December 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that causes COVID-19 has mutated multiple times, giving rise to different variants. Because most vaccines were designed to recognize the original SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, or at least parts of it, more mutated variants like omicron are better at escaping protection offered by the vaccines, although they still prevent severe disease.

Last month [December 2021], vaccine makers talked about tweaking the formula to have an omicron-specific vaccine handy, if needed. "But omicron won't be the last variant," says Stephen Zeichner, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Virginia Medical Center. "It's pretty clear that the virus continues to evolve and going forward there is a need for a universal COVID-19 vaccine or even a universal coronavirus vaccine."

Since 2020, in preparation for the next deadly coronavirus outbreak, which experts think is only a matter of time, some scientists started developing vaccines that protect against multiple coronaviruses. Many efforts currently focus on known sarbecoviruses, which include SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, and some SARS-like bat viruses that have the potential to jump from animals to humans.

Early tests in animal models are showing promising results. "The great thing about having such vaccines is that they could handle potentially new (SARS-CoV-2) variants as well as the next horrible spillover viruses that'll come down the road," says structural biologist Pamela Björkman at the California Institute of Technology, who is developing a universal vaccine for some SARS-like viruses.

One vaccine, multiple coronaviruses
-----------------------------------
The goal of such vaccines is to generate a broad immune response against multiple coronaviruses and their variants.

The effort that is farthest along is a vaccine developed by researchers at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, which has been tested in humans as part of a Phase I trial. The vaccine, which borrows technology developed for making universal flu vaccines, entails a soccer ball-shaped nanoparticle with 24 faces decorated with multiple copies of the original SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Peer-reviewed research conducted in monkeys showed the vaccine's ability to generate antibodies that neutralize and block the entry of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 and its major variants (excluding omicron, which was not tested) into animal cells. "The repetitive and ordered display of the coronavirus spike protein on a multi-faceted nanoparticle may stimulate immunity in such a way as to translate into significantly broader protection," Kayvon Modjarrad, co-inventor of the vaccine, stated in a press release. His team is currently analyzing the Phase I data.

Other universal coronavirus vaccine efforts involve targeting a slow evolving, genetic and structurally similar region on the viruses -- where antibodies bind as part of a body's immune response to a foreign invader -- or, in addition, engaging the body's immune cells called T cells.

Zeichner, for instance, is focusing on the fusion peptide region, which is part of the coronavirus spike protein that aids the entry of the virus into host cells, to develop a pan-coronavirus vaccine. "It is extremely conserved among all coronaviruses," he says. "It doesn't mutate very much." Along with colleagues, he tested a proof-of-concept vaccine using a SARS-CoV-2 fusion peptide and early results indicated that in pigs the vaccine provided some protection against a different coronavirus, called porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, that doesn't infect humans. His team is now collaborating with researchers at Virginia Tech and the International Vaccine Institute in Seoul to further develop and continue testing the vaccine against different SARS-CoV-2 variants and other coronaviruses.

Björkman and her colleagues, on the other hand, are focusing on a more specific target: the spike protein's receptor-binding domain (RBD). It's the region of the spike to which most antibodies bind to prevent SARS-CoV-2 from entering the host cell; it is also the region within which mutations occur, giving rise to variants. For the vaccine, they used RBD proteins from up to 8 viruses -- including the original SARS-CoV-2 and other SARS-like coronaviruses isolated from bats -- that were fused onto a nanoparticle with 60 faces. By injecting this vaccine into mice, Björkman and her colleagues found the animals produced diverse antibodies, which in follow-up experiments blocked infections caused by several SARS-like viruses, including coronavirus strains not used to create the vaccines.

To Björkman, this suggests that the animal's immune system might be learning to recognize common features between the coronaviruses and that her mosaic vaccine, with pieces selected from multiple viruses, might be useful when new SARS-like viruses or new SARS-CoV-2 variants emerge. Her team is currently gearing up to test the vaccine in humans.

Vaccine researcher Kevin Saunders at the Duke Human Vaccine Institute is also focusing on the RBD, but a very specific part of it, to make a pan-SARS-like virus vaccine. When the pandemic began in early 2020, Saunders and his colleagues began hunting for antibodies that would inactivate SARS-like viruses. They examined antibodies present in frozen stored cells of an individual who recovered from SARS-CoV infection and another individual previously infected with COVID-19.

They identified a potent antibody dubbed DH1047 occurring in cells from both patients that could block infections in mice that had been injected with several bat and human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 variants. A closer look revealed the antibody bound to the same small section of the spike protein's RBD in different coronaviruses, which became the vaccine target.

By injecting monkeys with multiple copies of this SARS-CoV-2 RBD piece fused to a nanoparticle, Saunders and his colleagues demonstrated the vaccine's ability to protect against not just SARS-CoV-2 but several other coronavirus infections. The team is now testing different iterations of this nanoparticle vaccine by introducing RDB sections from other coronaviruses to broaden the host's immune response.

"Sometimes you make hundreds of versions of these (vaccines) and test them in animals before deciding on a version to study in humans," says Julie Ledgerwood, deputy director and chief medical officer at the National Institutes of Health's Vaccine Research Center.

Meanwhile, scientists are also trying to figure out how these vaccines could cover not just SARS-like viruses but MERS and other more distantly-related coronaviruses too. "The sequence diversity and structural differences between coronaviruses that fall into different groups is going to be a challenge," Saunders says. Some scientists propose a different vaccine for different coronavirus families.

For now, though, the need for at least a pan-SARS-like coronavirus vaccine cannot be ignored. "We're no longer thinking of this as 'it'll be great to have this for the next pandemic,'" Saunders says. "We're thinking of this as a great tool to stop this pandemic."

[For those who wish to see the detailed global data, a snapshot of the Worldometer table at the time we accessed it is available at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/2022%20WORLDDATA%20JAN19_1642710732.pdf.

A 7-day series of cumulative totals reported by countries, territories, and reporting entities can be found at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/2022%20JAN19WORLD7_1642710746.pdf. It is from this table that numbers in the following commentary are derived.

In the past 24 hours, 43 countries -- the USA (1 042 103), France (436 167), India (322 762), Israel (243 295), Brazil (205 310), Italy (200 966), Spain (157 941), Argentina (128 321), Germany (121 952), the UK (107 450), Sweden (97 248), Belgium (91 286), Turkey (72 615), Australia (72 389), Portugal (52 549), Sweden (42 725), Japan (39 841), The Netherlands (38 200), Denmark (36 474), Kazakhstan (29 746), Switzerland (37 856), Russia (33 899), Poland (30 588), Czech Republic (28 564), Austria (27 677), Columbia (27 603), Canada (24 512), Philippines (22 867), Bolivia (21 702), Greece (20 100), Serbia (17 318), Romania (16 610), Costa Rica (16 070), Norway (15 987), Vietnam (15 959), Ukraine (12 815), Tunisia (12 436), Slovenia (12 299), Uruguay (11 714), Panama (10 763), Croatia (10 427), and Bulgaria (10 160) -- all reported over 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 10 461 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 17 Jan 2022 to late 18 Jan 2022). The exponential rise in cases over the last few weeks can be attributed to the rapid spread of the omicron variant globally. The 7-day averages indicate an increasing global trend for cases and deaths.

A total of 78 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 44 of the 78 countries are from the European region, 9 are from the Americas region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, 5 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 4 from the South East Asia region, and 10 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 13.8%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 11.1%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 1.3% decrease in daily reported cases and a 6.2% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: Over 4.1 million newly confirmed infections were reported worldwide in the past 24 hours. In total over 339.48 million cases and over 5.58 million deaths have been reported. - Mod.UBA]
