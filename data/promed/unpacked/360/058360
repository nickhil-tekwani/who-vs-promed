Veterinarians found antibodies against African swine fever in one of the 6 wild boar caught in the Ostrata region in Zlín [district], so the animal probably suffered from the disease. The virus can therefore still be in the territory. The Ministry asks that hunters and breeders continue to abide by principles of biosecurity. The last time the virus was detected in February [2018]. Antibody were last detected in wild boar in April [2018].

In the Czech Republic, extraordinary veterinary measures are still in force, regulating the intensive wild boar year-round catching. It is also forbidden to feed them. At the same time, the obligation to register the movement of pigs intended for domestic slaughter remains valid throughout the country.

"Despite the favorable development of the situation of African swine fever in the whole Czech Republic, extraordinary veterinary measures are still in force, and it is imperative that hunters and breeders abide by it. I urge pig breeders in the contaminated area to strictly adhere to the biosecurity rules of the breed and the conditions under which it is possible to process meat and send meat products from an infested area," said Minister of Agriculture Miroslav Toman (for the CSSD [Czech Social Democratic Party]).

In the infected area, which is part of the Zlín district, there is still a restriction of entry into the so-called high-risk area, where all the infected animals came from. Hunting and trapping of wild boar in an infected area are only permitted under veterinary permission. Among other things, all the animals found and caught are still being investigated for African plague. The incentive for hunters in the infested area and the wider area of intensive catches is still paid for the shotgun. Dead animals have been found within the whole of the Czech Republic. The disease is not dangerous for humans, but if it gets into pig breeding sector, it must be discharged.

The captured wild boar with positive antibodies, according to Petr Majer of the State Veterinary Administration, did not show signs of disease. Majer added that according to scientific studies, about 5 per cent of the infected wild boar will survive the disease. However, it is not possible to find out if the virus was in the spring or winter. During the whole period of the disease in the Czech Republic, antibodies were detected in 19 wild boar who did not suffer from the disease.

According to SVS [State Veterinary Adminsitration] Central Director Zbynek Semerád, the disease is now widespread in Hungary, on the border of Ukraine and Romania. In Poland, according to him, he is dealing with one 5th of the territory. At the beginning of July [2018], infection in commercial breeding was confirmed in Romania.

[African swine fever (ASF) is a devastating hemorrhagic fever of pigs with extremely high mortality rates. In affected countries, it causes huge economic losses. It is transmitted by soft ticks in the genus _Ornithodorus_.

The importance of wildlife reservoirs for disease maintenance has been clearly demonstrated. In Eastern Europe, the disease spread into the local wild boar populations. Further west- or eastward spread could adversely affect the pig sector in many countries. - Mod.PMB
