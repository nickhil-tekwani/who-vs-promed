Other details/comments:
The disease had not been seen in Thrace since June 2001. No FMD type A
outbreaks were detected in Turkey between the beginning of June 2005 and
November 2005. Following the detection of one outbreak due to type A in the
Eastern province of Elazig in November and 13 further outbreaks in December,
detailed investigations were initiated. Laboratory analysis showed that these
type A viruses were genetically quite distinct from A Iran 96 and A Iran 99
virus topotypes, both of which have recently been circulating in Turkey. The
sequence data which were obtained at the Ankara SAP Institute was sent to the
OIE/FAO Reference Laboratory in Pirbright, United Kingdom, and these viruses
were found to be closely matched with viruses isolated in Iran in 2005. The
antigenic relationship of these viruses with A Iran 96 and A Iran 99 vaccine
strains was very weak. These findings by the OIE Reference Laboratory in
Pirbright were also confirmed by the SAP Institute and the A 22 Mahmatli
vaccine strain was determined as the most effective vaccine strain against
these new viruses.
Viruses recently isolated from Thrace were also sequenced and found to be the
same as new viruses recently isolated from Anatolia.
Studies were immediately initiated with a view to producing a vaccine against
A 22 Mahmatli. Distribution of the new trivalent vaccine, which includes A 22
Mahmatli, O Manisa and Asia 1 viruses, was started on 10 Feb 2006.
In addition to the above-mentioned vaccinations, 6291 bovines and 1300 sheep
were vaccinated in the outbreak in Malkara/Tekirdag and 750 bovines were
vaccinated in the outbreak in Nadirli (Babaeski, Kirklareli province).
Within the framework of the spring vaccination campaigns, 59 865 bovines have
been vaccinated in Kirklareli province.
Final report: no.
