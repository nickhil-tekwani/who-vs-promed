FAO Technical note on cholera problems in East-Africa
Currently a few countries in East Africa are experiencing a cholera
epidemic. In such cases, there are often concerns about the potential
spread of the disease through international trade of fishery and other food
products, and there are also uncertainties on appropriate control actions.
In addition, Salmonella bacteria have been found in shipments of fish
products from some of these countries. The cholera disease presents a
serious danger to human health since the cholera agent can contaminate
animals and animal products.
Cholera is spread by contaminated water and food, with large outbreaks
usually resulting from contaminated water supplies. A wide variety of food
has been involved in the transmission of cholera including soft drinks,
fruits, vegetables, beer and milk. In addition, raw, uncooked, or
cross-contaminated cooked shellfish has also been established as a major
vehicle for V. cholerae 01 and non-01. The foods of greatest concern to
importing countries are products which may be consumed raw or lightly
preserved such as vegetables and shellfish. V. cholerae do not survive
proper cooking or drying. Thus cooked, dried or canned products are
considered safe with regard to cholera transmission provided that they are
not recontaminated after processing.
Further, commercial freezing does not destroy V. cholerae and therefore raw
frozen products should not be considered safer than fresh products per se.
Thus, fresh and frozen products should be treated equally. Epidemiological
data suggest that the risk of transmission of cholera from contaminated
imported fish and fish products is negligible. Only rare and sporadic cases
of cholera have occurred in developed countries as a result of eating
seafood transported across international borders by individuals. Indeed,
the World Health Organization (WHO) has not documented a significant
outbreak of cholera resulting from commercially imported food. FAO does not
think that a ban on import of fish products from countries affected by an
epidemic of cholera is the most appropriate response. Similarly, WHO has
noted that although there is a theoretical risk of cholera transmission
with food in international trade, the weight of evidence suggests that this
risk is very small and can normally be dealt with by means other than an
embargo on importation.
International recommendations and modern food legislation point out that
the most appropriate way to ensure the safety and quality of food products
is by applying preventive measures such as the use of the Hazard Analysis
Critical Control Points (HACCP) system at factory level and at national
inspection level. A prerequisite to a successful introduction and use of
HACCP is however to follow good hygiene and manufacturing practices as
recommended in international codes such as the Codex Alimentarius
International Code of Practice - General Principles of Food Hygiene and the
Codex Codes of Practices for Fishery Products.
This approach has been endorsed by all the major exporting and importing
markets including the European Union, Canada, Thailand and the United
States of America following recommendations and with full support from
international organisations such as FAO and WHO, the Codex Alimentarius
Commission, the International Commission on Microbial Specifications for
Foods (ICMSF) and the U.S. National Advisory Committee on Microbial
Criteria for foods. FAO has provided assistance for many years to
developing countries in adopting effective systems for food quality and
safety to assist them in ensuring a safe and wholesome food supply and
enable them to comply with new requirements from importing countries. FAO
can therefore reaffirm its support to countries and the increasing large
number of fish processors world-wide who have put efforts into the
introduction of better food quality and safety programmes which include
HACCP-based safety assurance systems.
FAO recommends that the most appropriate ways to prevent transmission of
cholera through international trade of seafood are :
. to strengthen measures to prevent the contamination of fish products
during harvesting, handling and processing and
. to specifically address this hazard as part of an on-going re-evaluation
of processing plants, HACCP plans and Good Manufacturing Practices plans.
These measures could include :
. additional monitoring and control of the safety of the water supply to
the factories using appropriate chlorination;
. additional monitoring of the health conditions and hygiene of the
personnel handling and processing fish products;
. upgrading fish handling equipment and storage facilities; and
. in more general terms to review and validate good manufacturing practices
and sanitation procedures in the processing plants.
Such measures minimise the risk of fish becoming contaminated. Certain
in-plant testing of water, fish, and personnel may be needed to identify
problem areas. However, it is well known that microbiological testing has
serious limitations as a control option to assess retrospectively the
presumptive safety of foods. Testing of fish products at ports of entry
must generally be considered as an inefficient means of retrospective
assessment of processing and storage conditions. It is however often the
only means to evaluate the safety of a product available to importing
countries that do not require producers to have a safety assurance plan in
place.
Introducing import restrictions on fish products from affected countries
will not prevent the transmission of cholera but will disturb international
trade and may encourage illegal trade thus posing a potentially higher
threat to consumers.
Importing countries have stated that putting preventive plans in place,
including HACCP-systems, will promote easier market access for fishery
products. This will facilitate their entry into other countries, and thus
promote fish trade and foreign exchange earnings for the developing
countries with good fish production potential. It is therefore increasingly
necessary for exporting countries to ensure the safety and quality of their
fish products by upgrading their landing, processing and storage facilities
and by introducing safety assurance systems while donor countries and
international organizations should increase their efforts in assisting them
in achieving this goal.

[The bottom line is that the trade restrictions are unjustified as no
cholera outbreak has yet been traced to commercial fish exports, and the EU
regulations are inconsistent in allowing frozen fish but not fresh, when
freezing does not kill the
bacteria (see above) - Mod.JW
