21 ill in respiratory tract infection outbreak
----------------------------------------------
The Centre for Health Protection is investigating an outbreak of
upper respiratory tract infection affecting 19 residents, aged 73 to
100, and 2 staff at a Sha Tin home for the elderly. The 21 affected
women developed symptoms between 15 Feb and 1 Mar 2010. All are
stable. One of the residents was admitted to hospital and tested
positive for respiratory syncytial virus.

Respiratory syncytial virus is spread by direct contact with
infectious secretions and can be easily transmitted among individuals
in institutional settings. The incubation period can be 1 to 10 days
but is usually 5 to 7 days. Common symptoms include fever, chills,
runny nose, cough, headache, and decreased appetite.

[Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a respiratory virus that
infects the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Most healthy people
recover from RSV infection in 1 to 2 weeks. However, infection can be
severe in some people, such as certain infants, young children, and
older adults. Respiratory syncytial virus is the most common cause of
bronchiolitis (inflammation of the small airways in the lung) and
pneumonia in children under 1 year of age worldwide.

Respiratory syncytial virus is ubiquitous and an important cause of
respiratory illness in older adults. Epidemiological studies have
identified respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus as the
most frequent causes of virus-induced respiratory disease in elderly
and high-risk adults. In temperate climates, respiratory syncytial
virus infections generally occur during autumn, winter, and early
spring. The timing and severity of respiratory syncytial virus
circulation in a given community can vary from year to year.

People of any age can experience a recurrence of respiratory
syncytial virus infection, but subsequent infections are generally
less severe. The elderly and adults with chronic heart or lung
disease or with immune systems weakened by medical conditions or
treatments remain at high risk for developing severe respiratory
syncytial virus infections.

The development of a respiratory syncytial virus vaccine has
encountered formidable immunological problems, which have yet to be
overcome, but a humanised monoclonal antibody has been employed
successfully in the treatment of bronchiolitis in infants. - Mod.CP]
