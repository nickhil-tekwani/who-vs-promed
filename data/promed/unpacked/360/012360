A Baldwin County resident has died from eastern equine encephalitis [EEE], a mosquito-borne virus infection, the Alabama Department of Public Health announced today [Fri 25 Oct 2019].

The person had become ill in September [2019]. It's the 1st confirmed case of EEE in an Alabama resident since 2014. EEE activity was reported earlier this year [2019] in a mosquito sample and sentinel chicken in Mobile County and a horse in Houston County, the ADPH said.

The Centers for Disease Control said that as of 22 Oct [2019] it has received reports of 35 confirmed cases off EEE in the United States this year [2019], resulting in 13 deaths. That does not include the Baldwin County case.

Encephalitis is an inflammation of the brain. Severe cases of EEE start with headache, high fever, chills, and vomiting, the ADPH said. Worsening symptoms include disorientation, seizures, and coma. About 1/3 of patients who develop EEE die. Many who survive have mild to severe brain damage. Symptoms develop 4-10 days after a bite from an infected mosquito.

People under age 15 and over age 50 are at greatest risk of severe illness when infected with the EEE virus.

Horses are susceptible to EEE and can die from it. Horses are not likely to spread the infection to people because they are considered to be "dead-end" hosts for the virus, as are people. Vaccination can protect horses.

Dr. Sherri Davidson, ADPH interim state epidemiologist, said people should take precautions to avoid mosquito bites despite the low number of EEE cases.

Davidson recommended:
- [Use] insect repellent containing DEET, picaridin, IR3535, or oil of lemon eucalyptus on exposed skin and/or clothing.
- The repellent/insecticide permethrin can be used on clothing to protect through several washes. Always follow the directions on the package.
- Wear long sleeves and pants when weather permits.
- Have secure screens on windows and doors to keep mosquitoes out.
- Eliminate mosquito breeding sites by emptying standing water from flowerpots, buckets, barrels, and other containers. Drill holes in tire swings so water drains out. Keep children's wading pools empty and on their sides when not in use.

[This is the 1st human EEE case reported in Alabama this year [2019], although there has been evidence of EEE virus transmission earlier in the summer with the virus detected in mosquitoes and infection in sentinel chickens and a horse. Residents in Baldwin county would be well advised to follow the ADPH recommendations to avoid mosquito bites and reduce vector mosquito breeding sites. Horses should be vaccinated. There will be a risk of EEE virus infection in the area until killing frosts occur. - Mod.TY
