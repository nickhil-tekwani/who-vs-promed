About 80 Nigerian refugees, who fled the Boko Haram dominated area in Borno, have died from cholera in refugee camps in Cameroon.

Although 20 of them have been hospitalized at the camps, reports say, the refugees, who are scattered in Maroua camps in Cameroon, have been sent back to Nigeria following the disease.

40 of the dead were from Pulka, 30 from Ngoshe, Attagara, Agapaluwa and 10 were early migrants from the hills of Gwoza.

[3] Cholera - Nigeria (Taraba State), IDPs

https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/168924-controversy-trails-reported-death-of-50-children-from-cholera-in-taraba-refugee-camp.html


Controversy is brewing in Taraba State, North-Central Nigeria, following reported outbreak of measles and cholera believed to have killed 50 children in a refugee camp. The camp, situated in an abandoned uncompleted healthcare centre in Bali Local Government headquarters, hosts thousands of Tiv people displaced by internecine warfare between the Tiv and Fulani herdsmen.

The camp's spokesperson, Emmanuel Kegh, said apart from the 50 children already affected by the outbreak, over 300 hundred [sic] others were at severe risk of infection. He therefore called on the government and relevant agencies and organisations to step up response mechanism to contend the epidemics. Mr. Kegh said before the outbreak of cholera and measles, over 20 inmates, mostly children and pregnant women, had died due to hunger, malnutrition and the dehumanizing conditions in the camp. He said, "The situation here is dire. We have lost 50 children already and more may still die unless something is done urgently."

Continuing, he said, "Life here in the camp can simply be described as hell on earth. We are not used living on peoples' goodwill. We are farmers and we are used to feeding very well. It is not a funny experience seeing your children dying of hunger. When we 1st came in here around March, SEMA came and gave us relief materials and later NEMA and people from the Defence headquarters."

2 out of the 3 regions that were not affected by the cholera outbreak, Upper East and West Region, have also recorded some cases. The only region so far without any recorded case is the Northern Region. This was revealed by the Deputy Minister of Health Dr. Victor Bampoe in an interview on the Citi Breakfast Show on Friday, 3 Oct 2014. The Minister also revealed that the number of recorded cases across the country has jumped from 10 000 to over 18 000, recorded in 96 districts.

The cholera outbreak began in July 2014 and it has so far claimed about 150 lives. The situation overburdened health facilities, especially in the Greater Accra Region where the outbreak began. The Greater Accra Regional Health Directorate has, however, announced a significant decrease in reported cholera cases.
