Anthrax Found In 4 Manitoba Herds
---------------------------------
Dr. Wayne Lees, Manitoba's chief veterinary officer, today confirmed anthrax
has been detected in 4 herds in southeastern Manitoba. The outbreak has
resulted in the death of 24 cattle and one horse. "Diagnostic samples provided
to the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory between 13 & 17 Jul 2006 from 4
locations in the regional municipalities of Stuartburn and Franklin were
positive for anthrax," said Lees. "This is not a surprising issue considering
anthrax outbreaks do occur from time to time and recently there have been
several cases confirmed in Saskatchewan and Minnesota."
Anthrax has been previously detected in Manitoba. Confirmed cases of bovine
anthrax in Manitoba over the past 5 years included 24 animals in 2000, 4
animals in 2001, and 3 animals in 2003. In 2005, 36 animals including 26
cattle and 10 horses died of anthrax on 12 premises in south-central Manitoba
between July and the end of September [see ProMED archives below. - Mod.JW]
While there have only been 2 reported cases of anthrax causing illness in
humans in Canada since 1990, mortality rates can be very high in herbivores.

Under the federal Health of Animals Act, anthrax is a reportable disease to
the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) that ensures strict enforcement of
quarantine and proper burning or deep burial of carcasses suspected to have
died from anthrax to prevent further soil contamination with the bacterial
spore.
Livestock vaccination is the standard method of controlling anthrax when
identified in a herd. Veterinarians of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency
vaccinate cattle on farms around the infected premises to create a buffer zone
in an effort to break the cycle of infection. Because animals are found dead
with no illness detected, producers should consult with their veterinarians
and vaccinate their livestock if deemed appropriate.

"We will continue to work with CFIA to monitor the situation," said
Lees. "The safety of beef and beef products remains protected in all cattle
slaughtered for human consumption."

[Thanks to Sandra for forwarding this up to date report, correct as of 8am
this morning, 21 Jul 2006. From a map kindly provided by Wayne Lees, one
Franklin outbreak is 17 miles from the US/Canada border next to Highway 59;
the other 2 are near where Highway 59 crosses the border. The suspect farm is
just across the highway on the western side, and these 3 are proximate to the
north central part of the Kitson County USA border with Canada. The
Stuartburn outbreak is 2-3 miles east of Highway 59 and the same distance from
the US/Canada border. Thus they are near to Kitson & Roseau Counties and also
in the Roseau River drainage, thus putatively an extension of the MN epidemic
and non-vaccinating habits of these individual farmers. The Roseau River
drainage is a traditional area for anthrax in this US/Canadian region. �
