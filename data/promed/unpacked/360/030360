Sexually transmitted diseases are on the rise, and syphilis has hit record levels. The venereal disease is widely perceived as a relic of the pre-antibiotic era, but research from UNSW [University in New South Wales]'s Kirby Institute for Infection and Immunity in Society shows that more Australians were diagnosed with the disease in 2013 than in any year since recording began.

More than 1760 syphilis notifications were recorded, a 34 per cent increase since 2009. The rate of diagnosis was highest in people aged between 20 and 39, and almost all were gay men. Nearly 600 of them were in NSW [New South Wales].

The Kirby Institute head of surveillance and evaluation, David Wilson, said that in the 1990s, the disease was almost non-existent. "Most people do consider syphilis to be a rare and isolated disease, not really of relevance today, and even 15 years ago that was true," Associate Professor Wilson said. "But we've seen a real resurgence, particularly among gay men and HIV positive gay men."

Historical data indicates that syphilis rates peaked in 1920 but there was a dramatic decrease after the advent of antibiotics. "What we're seeing now is the highest rates in recorded history," Associate Professor Wilson said. "Before penicillin, syphilis would have been higher than it is now."

The report -- HIV, Viral Hepatitis and Sexually Transmissable Infections in Australia -- also indicated an increase in notifications of gonorrhoea with 14 947 notifications in 2013 compared with 13 842 in 2012. There has been an 80 per cent increase in gonorrhoea notifications in the past 5 years. The most prevalent sexually transmitted infection was chlamydia, with 82 537 new diagnoses in 2013.

NSW Health data also released this week indicates that chlamydia and gonorrhoea notifications rose sharply in the 1st quarter of this year [2014], with 1211 cases of gonorrhoea and 5963 cases of chlamydia.

Communicable Diseases Branch acting director Christine Selvey said most of that increase could be attributed to more testing. But this was not the case for syphilis, where the reason for the increase was a mystery. "That's the million-dollar question that everybody is asking themselves," Dr Selvey said. "We don't really understand why it is."

[The news report refers to the Annual Surveillance Report 2014 of HIV, viral hepatitis and sexually transmissible infections in Australia, recently issued by the Kirby Institute for Infection and Immunity in Society and the Centre for Social Research in Health that is available at http://kirby.unsw.edu.au/sites/default/files/hiv/resources/ASR2014.pdf.

The following is extracted from this report:

"Chlamydia was the most frequently reported notifiable condition in Australia in 2013 with 82 537 diagnoses. The population rate of diagnosis of chlamydia in 2013 was 359 per 100 000 population, a decline on the rate for 2012 (364). This is the 1st occurrence of a reversal in the increasing trend in rates of chlamydia diagnosis from the commencement of notification by all state and territory health jurisdictions in 1999.

- The number of cases of gonorrhoea notified in 2013 was 14 947. The rate of diagnosis of gonorrhoea increased by 72 percent, from 37.5 per 100 000 population in 2009 to 64.6 in 2013, with increasing diagnoses in both males and females. [However, the population rates of gonorrhoea for males and females, which were relatively stable in 2004-2008 at around 50 and 25, respectively, increased substantially for males, from 51 in 2009 to 91 in 2013, compared to a smaller increase for females, from 25 in 2009 to 38 in 2013.]
- The number of cases of infectious syphilis notified in 2013 was 1765, the highest number recorded in Australia. The rate of diagnosis of infectious syphilis increased among males from 5.0 in 2004 to 14.0 in 2013. Increased rates of diagnosis of infectious syphilis in 2013 occurred in New South Wales, Queensland, Tasmania and Victoria, particularly among gay men, and declining rates were reported in Western Australia and the Northern Territory.
- The rate of diagnosis of chlamydia in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population was 3 times that in the non-indigenous population in 2009-2013. The rate of diagnosis of gonorrhoea in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population was between 13 to 24 times higher than the rate in the non-indigenous population.

The proportion of Sydney [capital of the Australian state of New South Wales on southeast coast of Australia] respondents to the Gay Community Periodic Survey who reported condom-less anal intercourse with casual partners increased from around 32 percent in 2004-2008 to 36 percent in 2009-2013 (Figure 22). The same survey carried out in Queensland [a state on the northern border of New South Wales] indicated that the proportion of respondents reporting unsafe sexual behaviour increased from around 32 percent in 2004-2008 to around 39 percent in 2009-2013. The respondents in Melbourne [capital of the state of Victoria, south of New South Wales] also indicated an increase in unsafe sexual behaviour, from around 28 percent in 2004-2008, to 35 percent in 2009-2013.

Surveillance data for gonorrhoea also provide an indication of unsafe sexual behaviour among men who have sex with men in Australia. The rate of rectal gonococcal isolates among men in New South Wales increased from around 6.0 in 2004-2008 to 6.9 in 2009-2013. In Victoria, the rate of rectal gonococcal isolates more than doubled over the past 5 years, from 7.3 in 2009 to 16.6 in 2013"

Another news report commenting on the 2014 Kirby Institute report said that "Experts trace the spike in syphilis and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) to a decrease in condom use, particularly among men who have sex with men (MSM). ... Since 2009, gonorrhea has surged 81 percent to 14 947 new cases; syphilis infections have risen 34 percent to 1765 new cases. For both diseases, MSM account for most of the increases." (http://news.sciencemag.org/health/2014/09/australia-sees-record-highs-syphilis-cases-and-hepatitis-deaths).

However, according to the 2014 Kirby Institute report "Among men who have sex with men seen at metropolitan sexual health clinics, the percentage of those younger than 25 years of age who were diagnosed with newly acquired HIV infection in the 10 years from 2004 to 2013 dropped to its lowest point (0.2) in 2013. Among men aged 25 years and older, the percentage with newly acquired infection declined from 1.0 percent in 2004 to 0.7 percent in 2013 (Figure 21)." If unprotected sex were occurring among MSM in general, the number of newly acquired HIV infections should have risen, as did other STIs, not fallen. To account for a rise in gonorrhea and syphilis, not accompanied by a rise in HIV infection, unprotected sex is likely occurring mostly among MSM who are already HIV-positive. In fact, a recent article posted by ProMED-mail reported that HIV-infected gay men seek out other HIV-positive sex partners to avoid using condoms, which, of course, would allow transmission of syphilis, gonorrhea, and other sexually transmitted diseases but result in no further increase in HIV transmission (ProMED-mail post Syphilis & gonococcal dis. - USA (04): (OR) rising incidence, MSM, HIV coinfect. 20140608.2527642). - Mod.ML
