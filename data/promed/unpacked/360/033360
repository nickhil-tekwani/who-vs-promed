Japan: Yokohama man bitten by dog in Philippines contracts rabies
------------------------------------------------
A Yokohama man is in serious condition, [having contracted] rabies after
being bitten by a dog in the Philippines, the Ministry of Health, Labor and
Welfare stated on Wed 22 Nov 2006. It is the 2nd rabies case discovered in
Japan in less than a week. Until then, Japan had not had a reported rabies
case in 36 years. Health Ministry officials responded to the resurgence of
the disease by [displaying] posters warning about the dangers of rabies. The
Ministry plans to put up the posters at places like airports and quarantine
centers.
Ministry officials said the latest case involved a man in his 60s who
normally lives in the Philippines but had temporarily returned to Yokohama.
A dog in the Philippines bit him on his hand in about August 2006. He
returned to Japan in late October 2006 and fell ill on 15 Nov 2006. Tests
confirmed that he had contracted rabies virus infection.
The World Health Organization estimates that rabies caused 55 000 deaths in
2004, including 248 fatalities in the Philippines. Rabies, after its
symptoms develop, has no known cure and a fatality rate of almost 100 per
cent. However, its effects can be fought through preventative vaccination or
if detected early enough.

[Although rabies vaccination is not a requirement for entry into any
country, travelers to and from rabies-endemic countries should be made aware
of the risk of contracting rabies.
In addition to the ever-present risk of bites from unvaccinated domestic and
feral dogs, travelers with extensive unprotected outdoor exposure in rural
areas, such as might be experienced while bicycling, camping, hiking, or
engaging in certain occupational activities, might be at high risk even if
their trip is brief.
Warning posters of such potential hazards are usually displayed at ports and
airports of countries where rabies has been eradicated. It is surprising
that this practice does not appear to have been adopted already in Japan, a
island country with no direct contact with endemic areas. - Mod.CP]
