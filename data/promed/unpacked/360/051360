The prevalence of scrapie in British sheep has declined by 40 per
cent over 4 years, according to new research. The researchers say the
decline is probably due to the success of policies like the Ram
Genotyping Scheme and the Compulsory Scrapie Flocks Scheme,
introduced in 2001 and 2004, respectively. Analysis by the Institute
for Animal Health (IAH) has provided evidence that the prevalence of
scrapie in sheep in Great Britain was "approximately constant" to
2003, before declining by around 40 per cent between 2003 and 2007.

One of the report's authors, Dr Simon Gubbins, of the institute's
Mathematical Biology Group, said it was not possible to identify the
precise causes of the reduction. "However, it is likely that the
various scrapie control schemes that have been in place in recent
years have contributed to this welcome decline in the prevalence of
the disease," he said.

The data for the study was provided to the IAH by the Veterinary
Laboratories Agency. It came from clinical investigations of reported
scrapie cases, an abattoir survey of apparently healthy animals over
18 months of age slaughtered for human consumption, and a fallen
stock survey of animals over 18 months of age found dead on farms.
Genotype data was provided by the National Scrapie Plan Advisory
Centre.

The findings from the Defra-funded research have just been published
in the journal Epidemiology and Infection. Scrapie -- one of a number
of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) -- has been
recognized in British sheep flocks since 1732. The disease is being
studied closely, because TSEs are potentially transmissible to
humans. Allied to this are concerns that scrapie could be masking BSE
in sheep. However, there is no evidence to date that scrapie could be
transmissible to humans or that natural infection of sheep with BSE
has occurred.

There is an interesting observation on the prevalence varying in
relation to stage of pregnancy.
