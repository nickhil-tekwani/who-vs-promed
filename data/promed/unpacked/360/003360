Virus found in 3 bats in Albany, New York State
-----------------------------------------------
ALBANY: State officials reported on Tuesday that West Nile virus has spread
for the first time in the Western Hemisphere to a wild mammal, with three
bats found in downtown Albany [infected with the virus. Three Big Brown
bats, which are about 3 inches in length, were discovered by homeowners in
the vicinity of Washington Park and initially submitted to the State Health
Department for rabies testing. But tests conducted at the State's Wadsworth
Laboratory found instead that they were infected with West Nile virus.
"There have been reports that bats were not faring well this summer, but we
thought it was perhaps due to the weather," said State wildlife pathologist
Ward Stone. "Big Brown bats eat insects, a food source threatened by cold
and rainy conditions. Bats are one of the [players in the West Nile fight
because they eat mosquitoes," said Stone.
While health officials are unclear what role bats may play in the
[epidemiology of West Nile virus infection, they stressed that a person
would not acquire the disease from a bat bite because the virus is
transmitted by blood. Scientists are unsure whether [West Nile virus can
multiply in a bat to a level sufficient to infect a blood-feeding mosquito.
"This is another clear indication that there are still many more questions
than answers about how West Nile virus is establishing itself in the
Western Hemisphere," said State Health Commissioner Antonia C. Novello.
So far this year, the virus has infected 412 birds, 6 wild birds such as
falcons, and one chicken in New York state. On Wednesday, 2 additional
birds were found in the Capital Region -- one each in Albany and
Schenectady counties. The only other mammal in which West Nile virus has
been detected this year was a horse on Staten Island.

[The detection of West Nile virus infection in bats is significant
development as these animals could be an amplifying host. West Nile virus
has been isolated from humans, birds, camels, rodents, horses and bats [in
India, as well as ticks, and many species of mosquitoes. However, these
isolations have all occurred in places outside the U.S. It is perhaps
premature to conclude that West Nile virus cannot be transmitted directly
to humans by bite. -Mod.CP
