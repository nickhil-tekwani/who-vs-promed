The New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH) reports a resident of Torrance County has been diagnosed with bubonic plague, making it the state's 1st human case in 2021. The patient is being treated in a local hospital and is expected to make a full recovery, according to a news release.

Officials say the person was most likely exposed to flea bites brought home by a pet. The release also states that an "environmental investigation will take place at the person's home to look for ongoing risk to immediate family members, neighbors and others in the surrounding community."

Plague is a bacterial disease of wildlife and is usually transmitted to humans and pets through the bites of infected fleas. According to NMDOH, one way for humans to become infected with plague is by sharing a bed with pets that may be carrying infected fleas.

To prevent plague, the Department of Health recommends that you:

- Avoid sick or dead rodents and rabbits, and their nests and burrows.
- Prevent your pets from roaming and hunting.
- Talk to your veterinarian about using an appropriate flea control product on your pets, as not all products are safe for cats, dogs, and children.
- Clean up areas near the home where rodents could live, such as woodpiles, brush piles, junk and abandoned vehicles.
- Put hay, wood, and compost piles as far as possible from your home.
- Don't leave your pet's food and water where rodents and wildlife can get to it.
- Have sick pets examined promptly by a veterinarian.
- See your doctor about any unexplained illness you may be having involving sudden and severe fever.

People who maybe have the plague also may experience chills, headaches and weakness in addition to a fever. Also, NMDOH states in most cases there is a painful swelling of the lymph node in the groin, armpit or neck areas. Plague symptoms in cats and dogs are fever, lethargy and loss of appetite. There also may be swelling in the lymph nodes under the jaw.

According to NMDOH, in 2020 there were 4 human plague cases: one in a 29-year-old man from Rio Arriba County that was fatal, one in a 64-year-old man from Santa Fe County who recovered, and 2 in Torrance County -- one in a 37-year-old man who recovered and one in a 57-year-old female who did not survive. In 2019, there was one human plague case.

["Plague was first introduced into the USA in 1900 by rat-infested steamships that had sailed from affected areas, mostly from Asia. Epidemics occurred in port cities. The last urban plague epidemic in the USA occurred in Los Angeles from 1924 through 1925. Plague then spread from urban rats to rural rodent species and became entrenched in many areas of the western United States" (https://www.cdc.gov/plague/maps/index.html).

"The typical sign of the most common form of human plague is a swollen and very tender lymph gland, accompanied by pain. The swollen gland is called a 'bubo.' Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, cats, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being infected."

When bubonic plague is left untreated or in cases where the bubo does not occur, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream (septicemic plague). As the "plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition.

"Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antimicrobial therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death" (https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/Departments-and-Agencies/DPH/dph/communications/CERC/PlagueFSwebpdf.pdf). Suspicion of septicemic plague without a bubo must occur in areas where the infection is endemic to minimize fatalities. About 14% (1 in 7) of all plague cases in the USA are fatal.

"In recent decades, an average of 7 human plague cases have been reported each year in the United States (range: 1-17 cases per year)" (https://www.cdc.gov/plague/maps/index.html). Most cases of _Yersinia pestis_ infections in the USA occur in the area of the "Four Corners" states -- Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah -- although California and, to a lesser extent, Oregon also may have cases.
