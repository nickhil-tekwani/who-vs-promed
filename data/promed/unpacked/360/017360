RABIES, HUMAN - RUSSIAN FEDERATION
**********************************
A ProMED-mail post
Date: Fri, 12 Dec 1997
From: Rabies List ex Henry Tsiang, Pasteur Institute

Several presentations of the rabies situation in the [Russian Federation] at
the International Rabies Meeting in Paris (13-14 Mar 1997) were forward by
some of our colleagues from Eastern Europe. It appears that rabies is still
a threat and that the disease in humans is not a rare event.
We recently received information from Tbilissi (Georgia) confirming these
allegations. He claims that since the last 9 months, 11 persons died from
rabies. This is an increase, compared to the last year figure (9 cases). A
total of 15,000 persons are consulting for dog bites; in Tbilissi the yearly
figure is 3,000-4,000. The vaccine used for post exposure treatment is the
one prepared in Moscow (Rabivac-Vnukovo 32) requiring 6 inoculations.
Availability of vaccine and immunoglobulin is also problematic.
This information illustrates the difficulty in recording all the human
rabies cases and the present underestimation of the rabies situation in
Eastern Europe.
