The Grant County Health District has confirmed a new case of measles,
making a total of 16 cases in the county. All are residents of Moses
Lake and occurred in unvaccinated individuals.

A children's group at the "Say Yes Lord Ministries" bible study,
which meets on Wednesday nights at Chief Joseph Middle School, has
been identified as a site where recent exposures have occurred.

Public Health officials are working with the exposed families to
assure they have access to the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine.

[This appears to be another instance of a measles outbreak involving
a group of individuals who have avoided MMR vaccination, possibly in
this case for reasons of religious conviction. It is not clear
whether the initial exposure originated from an indigenous case or an
imported case.
