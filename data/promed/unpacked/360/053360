Necrosis disease deals death to Austrian trout
----------------------------------------------
The newly re-named international Aquatic Animal Heath Standards Commission
(formerly the Fish Diseases Commission) has warned of a serious outbreak of
infectious hematopoietic necrosis amongst farmed trout in Austria.
So far 3500 fish have died or been culled at a farm in Salzburg province,
with the commission saying 8400 fish are vulnerable to catching the disease.
The farm has been placed under quarantine and investigations have been
launched by Austria's Official Veterinary office. It will ensure the
slaughter of any fish likely to have been exposed to the disease. Inquiries
have yet to reveal how the pathogen was introduced to the farm.
