Viral outbreak in hospital ward
-------------------------------
Northland District Health Board's Whangarei Hospital is urging people
with viral gastroenteritis-like symptoms not to visit patients in
hospital, or to call ahead for advice if they do need to visit.
Community acquired viral gastroenteritis has been identified within
ward 16. Features of the illness are those of norovirus infection --
predominantly vomiting and diarrhoea.

The hospital expects to receive laboratory results to confirm the
contamination this week. About 10 patients and several staff are
affected and ward 16 is closed to new medical admissions. Visitor
restrictions are in place.

Norovirus [infection] is a common cause of gastroenteritis. The most
usual ways of catching it is contact with infected people, eating
contaminated food (especially shellfish), or drinking untreated
water. Symptoms are predominantly vomiting and diarrhoea which
usually last about 48 hours.

The most important way of preventing spread is thorough hand hygiene
(washing hands for 20 seconds using soap and running water and drying
for 20 seconds).

[Norovirus outbreaks are unfortunately a common occurrence in
hospital wards in both hemispheres, although in the northern
hemisphere they are most common during winter months.
