Philippines: Human rabies cases alarming
----------------------------------------
The rise of human rabies brought about by rabid stray dogs in the
early month of January and February this year [2007] is alarming and
could get out of proportion if not immediately addressed by the
different government agencies concerned. The availability of
anti-rabies medicines [vaccine] in the Iloilo Provincial Capitol
Animal Bite Treatment Center is not a deterrent to the spread of
rabies unless animal owners themselves exercise responsibility in
raising their pets the proper way.
Provincial Administrator Manuel "Boy" Mejorada, together with
Provincial Health Officer Grace Trabado and Provincial Veterinary
Officer Dr. Silveno Teodosio made an appeal to members of the Iloilo
Capitol Press Corps during a press conference held Monday [5 Feb
2007] at the Governor's Board Room.
Four human rabies incidents occurred in January [2007] and another
one this month [February 2007], said Trabado. "The wrong beliefs of
the relatives and victims themselves resulted in their deaths,"
explained Trabado, who added that the behavior of people also caused
the increase of human rabies. "Victims should immediately wash their
bites with water and soap, which is commonly available even in
far-flung barangays [village settlements], instead of using "tandok"
[see below]. As you know, detergent can kill virus," Trabado said further.
Meanwhile, Teodosio encouraged the immediate destruction of stray
dogs and explained that they should be shot directly on their heads
with ammunition not less than 22 mm caliber. This is one way of
treating the animals humanely, said Teodosio. Also, he suggested that
the local executives exercise political will in annihilating stray
dogs in their corresponding settlements if they really want to
eliminate the spread of rabid dogs roaming around their areas of
responsibility.
Teodosio wanted an all-out-war against the "tandok" system by passing
a provincial dog control ordinance and making the "tandok" practice
unlawful, illegal, and a medical malpractice.

[The indigenous healing practice for the treatment of dog and snake
bites is called "tandok". It is popular in the southern parts of the
Philippines, but is not endorsed by the Philippine Department of
Health. Tandok, unlike many other traditional healing treatments, is
not recommended because it is highly invasive and may result in
tetanus, hepatitis, and other infections. Its safety and
effectiveness are not documented nor proven. In tandok, the healer
incises the skin then applies suction using a funnel-shaped carabao
[domesticated subspecies of the water buffalo] horn over the cut to
supposedly extract the venom or rabies. The healing session ends when
the healer perceives that all the venom or rabies [virus] has been sucked out.
Tandok and the irrigation of bites with soap and water are first-aid
measures of limited efficacy. They are no substitute for protection
against canine rabies by compulsory vaccination of dogs and
post-exposure vaccination of victims of dog-bite. - Mod.CP]
