age is below 2 years, and over 90% are under the age of 5 years.
Vaccination:
- Routine immunization (OPV) is administered at ages 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, and 16
to 24 months.
- Vaccine coverage was 94% in 1994; 91% as of 1997 (serosurveys estimate
the real figure at 73%); 73% in 1998.
- 90 million children were immunized in 1995. 125 million were immunized
during a one-day campaign in 1996, and an additional 120 million in 1997.

[As I could not understand what "due to wild (type) virus" means in the
table above, I asked Steve Berger for clarifying information, if he had it.
Here is his response: "I too am confused. These terms are used by WHO,
and the remainder are not further defined. We can assume that the
remainder are due to 1) cases not sent for laboratory testing, 2) cases due
to vaccine virus (only a small number), or 3) Acute Flaccid Paralysis
[AFP. The most common causes of AFP are Guillaine Barre syndrome followed
by transverse myelitis. To complicate things even further, tables coming
from WHO during the past few years continue to list cases of polio (wild
virus in parentheses) as well as (cases of) AFP. There is no way to tell
if the AFP cases are included in (the totals for) polio, or as a separate
entity." - Mod.CHC .........................chc/es
