Kampala Division Chairman Godfrey Nyakana has attributed the current
cholera outbreak in the city to lack of sewer lines. He said due to
overpopulation in the area, people have continued to construct houses
on sewage lines, thereby [diverting] the flow of sewage.
"Many people are suffering from diseases related to poor sanitation
like cholera because they don't have sewer lines. It has been easier
for cholera to spread in this area because it is the most populated
compared to other places," Nyakana said. Nyakana urged the National
Water and Sewerage Corporation to construct more sewer lines to
[remedy] the situation.
Recently, cholera hit Kampala city killing 6 people in Kawempe and
Makindye division. The epidemic also saw 35 patients admitted at
Kawaala health centre, the city's main cholera treatment center
approved by the Ministry of Health and the City Health Department.
In Kawempe, 3 people were reported dead while 20 others have been
admitted to Mulago and Kawaala hospitals.

At least 8 people have died and more than 200 others have been taken
to hospital in Uganda after a cholera outbreak erupted in the
capital, officials said on Wednesday.
Kampala district health secretary Caesar Tokoma said the deaths had
occurred over the last 2 weeks with many of the victims from the
city's northern suburbs, which have been inundated by flood waters.
"By this morning, 208 people were hospitalised at Kawaala Health
Centre and in the past 2 weeks. Eight deaths have been recorded of
whom 2 died in our hands and the rest died at home," Tokoma said.
He added that many of the cases were from markets in the slum areas
and warned the residents to be careful about where they draw their
drinking water.
Health ministry officials said that cholera cases had also been
reported in the country's northern districts of Kitgum and Pader,
while other cases have been reported in the western border districts
of Bundibugyo and Kasese.
Ministry spokesperson Paul Kaggwa said an assessment was being
carried out to determine the magnitude of intervention needed.

[3] Cholera - Somalia

According to the United Nations, residents of Somalia are also facing
problems of disease from overflowing latrines and hunger. The WHO
said the hygiene and sanitation conditions in the affected areas were
threatening an increase in communicable diseases. In Hiran, for
example, 70 percent of latrines have been destroyed. "The number of
diarrheal cases in the flood-affected areas is on the increase and
cholera has been confirmed in Jilib district in Middle Juba," the
agency said on Wed, 29 Nov 2006.
"Health facilities in the flood-affected areas have been disrupted
with damage or loss of equipment, supplies and vehicles," WHO added.
"Service providers and patients are facing difficulties in accessing
health facilities as roads have been cut off by the floods."
The flooding started when Juba and Shabelle rivers, which flow from
the Ethiopian highlands, swelled after heavy rains and burst their
banks in October. Nearly 400 000 people have been affected by the
surging waters, which have also inundated farmland, especially in
Lower Juba, particularly around the towns of Buaale, Jilib and
Jamaame. This number is expected to rise to 900 000 if rains continue
up to January 2007, as predicted by some analysts.

[4] Cholera - Angola

Following the latest outbreak of the cholera epidemic that resurfaced
with the arrival of the rains, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) decided
to reopen its previous intervention in Lubango in southern Angola.
Since the beginning of Nov 2006, the number of patients has continued
to rise -- 1427 to date -- and mortality remains very high.
After the 1st wave of the epidemic early in 2006, cholera is hitting
Angola hard once again. Faced with an increasing number of cases and
the emergence of new hotbeds of the disease, MSF decided to launch an
emergency intervention for the 2nd time in 2006. The organization is
calling on Angolan health officials and international organizations
working in the country to act on their responsibility to fight the
epidemic.
According to WHO, from the beginning of 2006 through Nov 5 2006, the
number of cases totals 58 138 with 2382 dead.
In Lubango, capital of Huila Province, MSF had already cared for
nearly 600 patients in a cholera treatment center during the 1st wave
of the epidemic. That wave seemed to be in check by Jul 2006, and the
infrastructure and remaining equipment were turned over to health
officials to enable them to address future needs. With cholera
currently on the rise again, MSF urges for immediate action.
"Other groups, particularly those responsible for purifying and
distributing water, must take more action in Lubango," demands Dr.
Andrei Slavuckij, head of MSF's operations in Angola. "Right now 50
to 60 patients are arriving every day and, if significant preventive
steps aren't taken, these numbers might climb even higher. The rains
have become stronger, making the work of the teams even more
difficult."

An outbreak of cholera epidemic has occurred in Delta State, killing
no fewer than 10 persons including 2 pregnant women living within the
Powerline area.
Investigation showed that it is becoming a yearly ritual for a few
years. In 2005, for instance, over 18 persons died and also 2 years
ago, the same thing occurred. The present incident noticed barely few
days ago has led to the hospitalization of several victims in various
hospitals.
As a result of the incident, many of the residents within the
riverine Oko communities have been threatened thereby forcing some of
the residents to flee. As at the time of this report a medical team
has been mobilised to the area to curtail its spread while the Public
Relations Officer (PRO) of the State Ministry of Health, Mr. Kingsley
Azu told Vanguard on phone yesterday afternoon that "we (ministry)
have intervened and sent drugs and water there. Also reacting over
the incident, a community leader, Mr. James Ubrebra called for urgent
government assistance.
