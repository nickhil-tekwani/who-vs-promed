The World Health Organization [WHO] is warning of an increased risk of disease epidemics in Syria and neighbouring countries as summer approaches. The WHO says outbreaks of diseases carried in water -- specifically hepatitis, typhoid, cholera, and dysentery -- are inevitable, given the severe disruption to Syria's health system.

Cases of diarrhoea and hepatitis-A have more than doubled since January [2013]. There have also been outbreaks of measles and typhoid [fever].

According to the WHO, at least 35 percent of the country's public hospitals are out of service, and in some areas, up to 70 percent of the health workforce has fled. Almost 4.25 million Syrians who have had to leave their homes are living in overcrowded, unsanitary conditions, with concerns about the provision of safe drinking water and safe sanitation.

"All the risk factors that enhance the transmission of communicable diseases in emergencies are present in the current crisis in Syria and its neighbouring countries," said Dr Jaouad Mahjour, director of the department for communicable diseases at the WHO's regional office for the Eastern Mediterranean. "We are anticipating a number of public health risks from water borne diseases, specifically hepatitis, typhoid [fever], cholera, and dysentery. Given the scale of population movement both inside Syria and across borders, together with deteriorating environmental health conditions, outbreaks are inevitable."

The WHO says cases of measles have reappeared in Syria, due to problems running national vaccination campaigns. The number of confirmed cases of measles in the 1st quarter of 2013 reached 139, compared with no cases in the whole of 2010 and 2011, says the WHO. There have also been reports of measles, tuberculosis, and cutaneous leishmaniasis -- a disease carried by insects -- among displaced Syrians in Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, and Turkey.

"Jordan had previously reported zero cases of measles for 3 years, and was planning to officially declare that it was measles-free," said Dr Mahjour. "The situation will deteriorate if prevention and control measures are not scaled up soon."

[War often disrupts a nation's private, as well as public health systems. A nation's public health system is a complex network of people, systems, and organizations, working at both the local and national levels, that is responsible for maintaining the health of its entire population, rather than individuals; unfortunately, this network is fragile and is easily disrupted during wartime. Mass migration of a nation's population both within its border, as well as across borders, occurs to avoid the hazards of warfare, which often leaves behind those too young, too old, or too weak to escape.

Loss of the nation's public and private healthcare professionals due to migration, compounded by destruction of medical facilities, loss of access to medical supplies, medications, and vaccines, severely limits provision of essential healthcare services. These deprivations, especially for the most vulnerable segments of the population, that is, the injured, the very young, pregnant women, the elderly, the chronically sick, and the disabled, may leave them more susceptible to lack of adequate nutrition, clean water, or sanitation, or environmental stresses such as the weather. Cross-border migration spreads these problems to neighboring nations. The effect of war on the health of a nation has been well-documented by Dr Jonathan Mann and colleagues in the Bosnian conflict in the 1900's (1).
