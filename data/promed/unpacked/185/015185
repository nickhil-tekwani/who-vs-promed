A serious tick-borne diseases has surfaced in Minnesota, and claimed
the life of a child in Dakota County this month, state health
officials said Wednesday [29 Jul 2009]. The disease, Rocky Mountain
spotted fever, is rare in Minnesota but poses grave risks to patients
who contract it.

The child was probably bitten within Dakota County by a tick infected
with Rocky Mountain spotted fever, the state Health Department said.
This is Minnesota's 1st reported fatality from the disease in 2009
the department said. Sporadic cases of Rocky Mountain spotted fever
have been reported around Minnesota in recent years, the department
said. About 2000 cases are reported annually in other parts of the USA.

"Rocky Mountain spotted fever is quite rare in Minnesota compared to
southeastern states," said Melissa Kemperman, an epidemiologist
specializing in tick-transmitted diseases with the state Health
Department. "But this recent fatality and the high numbers of
American dog ticks in our state underscore the need to be aware of
this serious disease and to prevent bites from any kind of tick." The
American dog tick, the Rocky Mountain wood tick and the brown dog
tick can all carry the organism.

Symptoms of Rocky Mountain spotted fever include high fever, headache
and a rash. Patients may also have muscle pain, joint pain, malaise,
nausea, vomiting and loss of appetite. About 5 percent of patients
die from their infection.

[It is vital to diagnose this rickettsial infection promptly to
minimize morbidity and mortality. This is particularly true in areas
such as the midwestern USA, where the disease is uncommon. The time
frame in this case is not clear.

When the female tick harboring the organism attaches to a passing
human, she usually starts low on the body after transferring from
grassy vegetation or even directly or indirectly from a dog. After
crawling around on clothes seeking an appropriate cutaneous site
(wearing white clothes makes a wandering tick easier to spot), she
attaches and begins to feed.

After attaching, it generally takes as many as 24 hours to activate
and transmit the rickettsial organism. For this reason, daily or
twice daily tick checks with removal will minimize disease
transmission. Ticks that attach in hairy areas such as the scalp or
beard may be more difficult to find.

The incubation period of the disease is about a week after the tick
exposure, long after the tick has detached. The presenting illness is
generally nonspecific, fever, muscle pains, headache (but the
headache is usually described as quite severe). The rash begins in
day 3 of illness, initially maculopapular at the wrists and ankles
before becoming petechial and purpuric involving the palms and soles
as well as spreading proximally to the truck. Purpura usually are not
seen before the 6th day of illness. The mortality is indeed quite low
if treatment (usually a tetracycline) is begun during the 1st 2 days
of the rash or before.

Empiric treatment for this infection should always be begun in people
with compatible symptoms inhabiting endemic areas during the spring
and summer, even if no tick bite is known.

The female _Dermacentor variabilis_ (the American dog tick), a common
vector for this infection, can be seen at:
