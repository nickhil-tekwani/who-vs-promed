Hepatitis warning on semi-dried tomatoes
----------------------------------------
Health authorities in Victoria and South Australia say semi-dried
tomatoes have been linked with a spike in the number of hepatitis A cases.

People are being warned not to eat loose semi-dried tomatoes sold in
oil with herbs and garlic at IGA, Foodland, Foodworks, and
independent delis and cafes.

Victoria's acting chief health officer, Rosemary Lester, says the
move is precautionary. "Although the links between the product and a
recent increase in hepatitis A cases in Victoria are still under
investigation, we have taken this measure in collaboration with our
colleagues in [South Australia]," she said in a statement. "We are
also working with the Victorian manufacturers to remove this product
from these stores across Victoria."

The Victorian Department of Human Services says hepatitis A is spread
when traces of faecal matter containing the virus contaminates hands,
objects, water, or food and is then taken in by mouth. Symptoms of
hepatitis A include abdominal pain, nausea, fever and chills, and
jaundice. The department says anyone experiencing these symptoms
should contact their doctor or "Nurse On Call" on 1300 6060 24.

The total number of hepatitis A cases reported in Victoria this year
[2009] is 90 compared with 41 reported for the same period last year
[2008]. The warning does not apply to semi-dried tomatoes sold in
jars, pre-packaged, or vacuum packages.

Tomato product linked to hepatitis A spike in South Australia
-------------------------------------------------------------
A semi-dried tomato product mixed with garlic, herbs, and oil has
been linked to a spike in hepatitis A cases in at least 3 states,
health authorities say.

South Australian director of public health Kevin Buckett says there
have been 26 cases in the state since March [2009], more than 70 in
Victoria, and an increased number in Queensland.

The cases are thought to be linked to the tomato product, which is
manufactured in both Victoria and Queensland and sold in various
states by weight. The product is sold in supermarkets and could also
be used by snack bars and cafes in food preparation. It is being
recalled by the manufacturing company, Dr Buckett said. People who
suspect they may have some of the product, or any similar product, at
home should discard it.

Dr Buckett said tests were yet to determine the exact source of the
contamination. He said health officials in SA were working with their
counterparts in Victoria and Queensland to identify which ingredient
was responsible. "The advice we're getting from epidemiology is that
the outbreak is ongoing and we're doing what we can to protect the
public,'' Dr Buckett said. "There is a national incident response
process that has been triggered.'' A series of tele-conferences on
Friday [22 May 2009] were expected to determine the level of response
in other states.

[The source of the contamination has not yet been determined. A
review of the literature, including MMWR reports did not identify
prior reports of outbreaks of hepatitis A virus associated with
consumption of tomatoes. Further information is awaited.
