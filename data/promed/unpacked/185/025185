Norwegian officials are investigating an increase of _Yersinia_ infections reported since late April 2021. Based on the range in geography of those infected, officials believe the source is a widely distributed food product. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (Folkehelseinstituttet) reported the rise in _Yersinia enterocolitica_ O3.

An outbreak investigation has been started with relevant local agencies, the Veterinary Institute, and Norwegian Food Safety Authority (Mattilsynet). Patients are between 16 and 54 years old and 2/3rds are women. Bacteria with the same DNA profile have been detected in all ill people, meaning they are likely linked to a common source of infection. Samples were taken during the last week of April 2021 and early May 2021. The 15 cases live in several different counties in Norway. Five people are sick in Trondelag, 3 each in Viken and Vestland, 2 in Rogaland and one each in More og Romsdal and Vestfold og Telemark. Patients are being interviewed, and the Norwegian Food Safety Authority is taking samples from food products in the homes of those who are infected to try to solve the outbreak.

Every year, between 40 and 80 cases of yersiniosis are reported to the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, with the majority infected domestically.

The Norwegian Veterinary Institute recently published findings from an analysis of pork products for _Yersinia enterocolitica_. From more than 150 samples of ground pork collected from supermarkets in 2019 and analyzed in 2019 and 2020, pathogenic _Yersinia enterocolitica_ was isolated from 9 of them. Results showed a low incidence of pathogenic _Yersinia enterocolitica_ in Norwegian pork products, but such items are still thought to be a major source of infection.

In late 2020, a _Yersinia_ outbreak in the country that affected 10 people was traced to salad, and another outbreak in May this past year [2020] that sickened 23 people was linked to imported spinach.

Yersiniosis is an infection caused by the bacterium _Yersinia enterocolitica_. The most common symptoms in children are diarrhea, fever, and abdominal pain. In older children and adults, right-sided abdominal pain and fever could be the main issues. Symptoms typically develop 4 to 7 days after exposure and last 1-3 weeks.

[The 2 species of _Yersinia_ associated with foodborne disease are _Y. pseudotuberculosis_ and _Y. enterocolitica_. The latter species can be associated with abdominal pain as a hallmark symptom. As a mesenteric lymphadenitis, yersiniosis can mimic appendicitis but may also cause infections of other sites, such as wounds, joints, and the urinary tract.

As noted in the FDA "Bad Bug Book" (https://bit.ly/3pmDJN1): "Strains of _Y. enterocolitica_ can be found in meats (pork, beef, lamb, etc.), oysters, fish, and raw milk. The exact cause of the food contamination is unknown. However, the prevalence of this organism in soil, water, and animals, such as beavers, pigs, and squirrels, offers ample opportunities for it to enter our food supply. Poor sanitation and improper sterilization techniques by food handlers, including improper storage, cannot be overlooked as contributing to contamination."

In addition, some strains of these organisms can be associated with blood transfusion-associated illnesses due to an ability to grow at refrigerator temperatures. - Mod.LL
