[This is the 3rd FMD-O outbreak in Xinjiang since the start of the event on 15 Aug 2018 (archive no. 20180826.5988964), of which 2 outbreaks in cattle have already been reported to the OIE, on 23 Aug and 2 Nov 2018 respectively. Their OIE summary as of 2 Nov 2018, follows:
Total outbreaks = 2 (submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Cattle / 446 / 83 / 4 / 442 / 0

For details of each of the 2 outbreaks, their summary, and a map, see http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000028503_20181102_134543.pdf).

For the location of the current outbreak, less than 100 km [62 mi] from Kazakhstan's territory, see map at https://goo.gl/maps/Erwy3k3XXPo.

The current, 3rd outbreak, involves pigs, a species regarded, due to its prolific FMD virus production, as a potential source of spread of airborne virus.
