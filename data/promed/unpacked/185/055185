African swine fever [ASF] found in domestic pigs in Belarus
-----------------------------------------------------------
Domestic pigs in Belarus, Grodnya Region (40 km [about 25 miles] away from the Lithuanian border), have been diagnosed with African swine fever [ASF]. The State Veterinary Service of Belarus has introduced a strict quarantine over the area.

This dangerous disease was previously found in Georgia, Ukraine and Russia. In Latvia, wild pigs are screened in laboratories not just for the presence of classic swine fever, but recently also for ASF. Latvian Food and Veterinary Service [FVS] reports that no signs of the infection reaching Latvia have been found so far.

In order to prevent any cases of infection, FVS reminds all pig owners as follows:

1. Pigs should be kept indoors and not allowed contact with wild boars.

2. Domestic pigs should not be fed with waste from wild boars or kitchen waste.

3. Desirably, outsiders should not be allowed entrance to pig sheds unless disposable clothing is used.

4. Clothing worn during hunting must not enter the pigs' premises.

5. Disinfectant mats must be placed at the entrance to the premises.

6. Pest control [application of insecticides] should be performed regularly.

ASF is a very dangerous, highly contagious viral disease that affects pigs. In the event of contamination, all pigs within a designated area are to be put down in order to prevent even more losses from the disease.

Animals struck by the illness generally have increased body temperature (40-42 C), their eyes water often, and they are less active, often seen lying on the ground. If they do walk, they have serious coordination problems. Animals die within 7-10 days after infection.

The FVS reminds the public that it is the sole duty of the owner to make sure his livestock are safe from the disease. So if the owner finds that one of the pigs looks unhealthy or acts in an unusual way, the veterinary service should be informed of this as soon as possible.

Seeing as how ASF has been discovered in several regions of Russia, the FVS introduced safety measures along the border as well. All transport heading from the Russian Federation is to undergo disinfection quality and disinfection documentation inspection.

ASF is very resilient to external factors. It can survive in at least 4 C temperature for 150 days. It can live up to 140 days in dry salted ham. Its general resilience peaks in frozen products -- up to several years.

It is prohibited to carry meat and meat products to the European Union from 3rd countries. ASF is harmless to humans.

[2] DEFRA, ASF situation assessment - Russia, Belarus

African Swine Fever in Belarus and Russia Preliminary Outbreak Assessment
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Disease Report
--------------
The Russian Authorities have reported this month [June 2013] to the OIE outbreaks of ASF in backyard pigs in Rostov, Voronezh and Volgograd regions along the border with the Ukraine and in wild boar in Smolensk region north of Moscow. Disease control measures are in place, including stamping out and disinfection of establishments.

In addition, Belarus has reported ASF for the 1st time, in backyard pigs in the region of Grodno in the west of the country. Again, disease control measures are in place.

Situation Assessment
--------------------
This is the 1st time ASF has been reported in the Smolensk region and as it is in wild boar rather than domestic pigs, it may represent a spread in the wildlife rather than a "jump" through swill feeding of infected pig products or long range movements of live pigs and/or contaminated trucks. Wild boars seem to play a less important role in the dissemination of disease around Russia, but they are likely to be involved as reservoirs and sentinels for the backyard pig sector. In a recent EMPRES report (2013) the seasonal pattern of outbreaks in wild boar and backyard pigs was highlighted [see comment]. In particular, 3 quarters of all ASF events are reported between June and November in the backyard sector, while a quarter of all wild boar outbreaks are reported in May and June. This is in line with the increasing population size at these times of year. These latest outbreaks are the 1st reports of ASF from Russia for several months, and this ties in with the seasonal reporting which appears to be a feature of ASF in this region. The report also highlighted that the ASF virus has been found in illegally disposed carcasses and meat processing plants a number of times since the disease was 1st reported in 2008 in Russia. Low temperatures used for chilled and frozen storage of pig products do not destroy the virus and therefore these products are a potential risk where swill feeding is commonly practiced.

In the case of Belarus, this report is not entirely surprising given the proximity to West Russia, where the disease appears to be established in wild boar. It is a concern for the Eastern EU as this is close to the border with Lithuania, where recent cases of CSF in wild boar have been linked to trans-boundary movements of wild animals. Should this latest outbreak in Belarus be a result of wildlife contact and not swill feeding of infected products, this would increase the risk of introduction into the EU. Further information from Belarus would be useful.

Conclusions
-----------
Live pigs and pig products from Russia and Belarus are not approved of for import into the European Union. However, there is clearly a risk that infected pig products are in the catering chain in Russia and this could result in people illegally bringing such products into the EU. While there are checks at the borders and airports/ports for passengers carrying such items, it is also equally important to maintain the on-farm ban of swill feeding of products of animal origin (POAO) to animals. As we have previously stated, countries and regions where certain risk factors, such as a high proportion of backyard pig farms, wild boar contact, suitable vector (argasid tick) populations or practicing swill feeding are at greater risk than those EU Member States with mainly high biosecurity commercial pig farms (such as the UK). Nevertheless, the persistence and geographic spread of ASF makes it a threat to the whole of the EU and it is imperative that control measures are applied effectively and regular exchange of information and expertise is maintained. We will continue to monitor the situation and report on technical and political developments as part of exchanging information with other countries and sectors.

[The DEFRA report includes a useful map, "ASF in West-Russia/Belarus, presenting terrestrial biomass", at the source URL above.

Reference 1 above (EMPRES Watch, May 2013) is a comprehensive, richly illustrated, useful 14-page document. The contents includes the following subjects: Introduction, Overview on key production systems affected by ASF, ASF main epidemiological features, Challenges in ASF detection and control, Risk assessment for the region, Risk management options for at-risk countries, Conclusions, and References.

The Conclusions chapter is hereby presented:

"Since 2008, ASF persists endemically and continues to spread into new areas of the Russian Federation. Half of the 30 affected administrative units are either endemic or on the way to becoming endemic, including Tverskaya Oblast, where some of the highest wild boar densities are found. The analysis of outbreak data from the Russian Federation in this study, provides valuable lessons for at-risk countries in the region and beyond. In the Russian Federation, the high-risk periods for disease introduction and spread are summer and fall for domestic pigs, and the end of spring and winter for wild boar.

The LB [low biosecurity] sector remains the main risk factor for disease introduction and endemicity, almost exclusively through swill-feeding of infected pork. The long resistance of ASF virus in pork and other pig products represents the main reservoir of the disease. In the absence of adequate control measures, LB production systems can sustain ASF transmission indefinitely, seasonally leaking to higher biosecurity sectors, i.e., semi-commercial and even industrial pig farms. Timely detection of ASF can be complicated and often delayed, thus allowing further spread through the movement of pig products within, and often outside, the affected region. ASF also spills easily from LB systems to wild boar, usually through the illegal disposal of contaminated carcasses into the environment. So far, circulation of ASF observed in wild boar populations has been limited in space and time. However, the role of wild boar could change into a year-round transmission cycle, should denser populations be affected. In addition, the role of wild boar in trans-boundary spread cannot be neglected.

The worsening of the epidemic in the Russian Federation, with an increased ASF virus load and circulation and the establishment of the disease in central European Russia, imply an exponential increase in the risk of ASF to further expand westwards through the increasingly dense populations of LB pig and wild boar populations into Eastern Europe and beyond. Countries bordering the Russian Federation with large LB pig populations, particularly Ukraine, Republic of Moldova, Kazakhstan and Latvia, are most vulnerable to ASF introduction and endemic establishment. At-risk countries should be on high alert and should learn from the Russian experience, investing in ASF preparedness and improving their early detection and response capacity. Sporadic introductions are bound to occur, so a swift response to outbreaks to prevent further spread is critical." - Mod.AS]
