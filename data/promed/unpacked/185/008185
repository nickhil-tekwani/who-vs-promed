Notable outbreaks of salmonellosis in the United States related to fruit,
vegetables, and related products.
-------------------------------------------------------
An outbreak (751 cases identified) of _S. typhimurium_ infection in Oregon
during 1984 was ascribed to intentional contamination of restaurant salad bars.
_S. chester_ (Central American cantaloupe) 254 cases in 1990.
_S. javiana_ (tomatoes) 176 cases in 1990.
_S. poona_ (American and Central American cantaloupe) over 400 cases in 1991.
_S. montivideo_ (tomatoes) 100 cases in 1993.
_S. saphra_ (Mexican cantaloupe) 24 cases in California in 1997.
_S. baildon_ (raw tomatoes) 85 cases in 7 states during 1998 to 1999.
An outbreak of _Salmonella thompson_ infection (41 cases, 3 admitted to
hospital) from a restaurant in California in 1999 was ascribed to fresh
cilantro.
Citrus juices:
Orange juice was implicated in an outbreak of _S. hartford_ infection
(Florida orange juice; 63 cases) in 1995. _S. muenchen_ from orange juice
was responsible for over 400 cases (21 admitted to hospital) in 25 states
and Canada in 1999. A multistate outbreak of over 70 cases of _S.
enteritidis_ infection was caused by contaminated citrus juices in 2000.
Fresh sprouts:
A outbreak of _Salmonella enterica_ serogroup _newport_ infection during
December 1995 to January 1996 involved 133 cases in British Columbia and
Oregon and was traced to contaminated alfalfa sprouts. 242 cases of _S.
stanley_ infection were ascribed to alfalfa sprouts in 1995. Over 500 cases
of _S. montivideo_ and _S. meleagridis_ infection were ascribed to alfalfa
sprouts in 1996. An international outbreak (about 242 cases in the United
States and Finland, 1997) of _Salmonella_ serotype _stanley_ was traced to
alfalfa sprouts and involved at least 17 states. A separate outbreak of _S.
infantis_ and _S. anatum_ infection (109 cases) the same year was also
ascribed to alfalfa sprouts. A mixture of alfalfa and clover sprouts was
implicated in an outbreak of 60 cases of salmonellosis in California during
1997 to 1998. 18 cases of salmonellosis were associated with alfalfa
sprouts in California in 1998. A multistate outbreak (34 cases) of _S.
havana_, _S. cubana_ and _S. tennessee_ infection the same year was also
ascribed to alfalfa sprouts. About 85 cases of salmonellosis in Oregon,
Washington state and California were ascribed to alfalfa sprouts in 1999.
175 cases of _S. muenchen_ infections were recorded during a multistate
outbreak traced to alfalfa sprouts in 1999. Clover sprouts were implicated
in California (30 cases) and Colorado (70 cases) in 1999. Raw mung-bean
sprouts were responsible for 45 cases of _S. enteritidis_ infection in
California in 2000.
