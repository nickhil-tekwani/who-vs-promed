to black Sigatoka in Venezuela. INFOMUSA 6(1): 16-17.
Bananas are important in many countries in the world and especially in
Latin America and the Caribbean. In 1991, FAO estimated world production
to be 74.5 million tonnes, including 20.5 million tonnes in Latin America.
In Venezuela, the only banana cultivars grown are 'Harton' and 'Cavendish',
forming 7% of Latin American production. However, these crops are
currently suffering from both biotic and abiotic problems.
Among the fungal diseases that have an economic incidence, _Mycosphaerella
musicola_, causing yellow Sigatoka, and _M. fijiensis_, causing black
Sigatoka, have direct effects on production by causing a drastic reduction
of the leaf area.
Black Sigatoka is much more aggressive than yellow Sigatoka. It is
spreading rapidly across the Central American isthmus, Colombia and
Venezuela and is a considerable cause for concern because of the
socioeconomic implications that lead to an atmosphere of uncertainty among
growers. Indeed, they can result in a disaster with unforeseen results
because of the high cost of control (fungicides) that reduce the production
capacity of small and medium-scale growers.
Black Sigatoka was observed for the first time in Venezuela in 1991 in
Zulia state south of Lake Maracaibo (the Colombian frontier) in the western
part of the country. Certain symptoms of the disease were observed and
samples were taken for laboratory study. In 1992 and 1993, the disease
gradually spread through the Andean piedmont regions (the lower zones in
the states of Tachira, Merida and Trujillo and in part of Barinas). It was
severe and intense, especially on AAA genome plants (bananas), which are
more susceptible. Quarantine measures were therefore taken, such as the
forbidding of transfer of germplasm for the multiplication of Musaceae and
of the use of leaves for packaging purposes for example.
As black Sigatoka persisted in the west of the country, changes occurred in
agricultural practices. Disease control by fungicide application is
possible but expensive and with a risk of increasing the resistance of the
fungus. Agricultural measures are required, such as an appropriate
fertilization programme, weed management, the removal of dry leaves and
those at the base of stems in order to reduce inoculation pressure, good
drainage and regular planting density, all accompanied by alternative use
of fungicides of different chemical groups.
However, in spite of these measures, the disease spread to Yaracuy state in
the central western part of the country in 1994. Infection reached the
Urama region (at the boundary between Yaracuy and Carabobo states) at the
end of that year. This forms a substantial threat to the banana plantations
in Aragua state in the central region, which account for some 50 percent of
total national production.
Certain climatic conditions enhance the effect of the pathogen and the
development of the disease. The regions in which black Sigatoka is found
have relative humidity close to 80 percent, average temperature of 26 - 28
Centigrade and annual precipitation of 1,400 mm or more. The states of
Monagas, Miranda and Delta Amacuro in the east of the country have similar
climatic conditions although the disease has not yet been observed there.
This means that in time these states risk a high level of contamination,
perhaps even higher than in Aragua state where the rainfall curve is
irregular, with a total of 1100 mm per year, six months of drought and six
months of rainfall and 74 percent average relative humidity. Even when the
other climatic conditions coincide, allowance must also be made for the
efficacy of the fumigation programmes performed to control the yellow
Sigatoka found in the region. This treatment may limit the spread of black
Sigatoka. This does not mean that Aragua state is protected from the
arrival of the pathogen, but the losses would not be comparable with those
in the states mentioned above. In fact, the first outbreak was observed in
Aragua state on a plantation at the edge of Lake Valencia, near the village
of Guigue (Carabobo State) in October 1996. Because of the proximity of the
lake, relative humidity is 80 percent, rainfall is distributed throughout
the year and considered to be atypical and errors are made in the
plantation in the application of fungicides for the control of yellow
Sigatoka.
Field trials are now in progress to evaluate the behaviour of the
tetraploid hybrid 'FHIA-21' with regard to black Sigatoka. This hybrid was
introduced into the country within the framework of the SASA-FAO agreement.
Other appraisals of hybrids are planned with the same objectives within the
framework of the FONAIAP- INIBAP agreement.
It is obvious that black Sigatoka is spreading in Venezuela and that this
is enhanced by man, resulting in a distinct decrease in banana and plantain
production because of the high cost of fungicides. This is leading to a
decrease in the cultivated area, changes in orientation and an increase in
the unemployment rate and the final production cost. In addition, one
cannot hide the serious problem formed by the indiscriminate use of
chemicals that cause a high level of pollution.
It is essential to make the persons concerned aware of the scale of the
problem of black Sigatoka in the country and to find solutions for
controlling the disease. This has already been started with a national
information campaign organised by FONAIAP and based on discussion with
growers, regional trials, etc. [FONAIAP is the National Fund for
Agricultural Research, in Venezuela - Mod PKA
Broader study of the biology of the fungus involved and its influence on
the control of the disease is required. Better knowledge of the climate and
its impact on the reproduction of the fungus and the development of the
disease is required. It is also necessary to make recommendations based on
epidemiological study covering all the countries in Central America. One
might suggest that biological warning systems should be set up in regions
where there is a high risk of infection, enabling the appropriate use of
chemicals and hence the attaining of productivity levels that compensate
production costs.
