JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS AND OTHER - INDIA (17): COMMENT

The media report cited in the posting [Japanese encephalitis & other - India (16): (BR) 20151116.3794161] describes cases diagnosed as acute encephalitis syndrome (AES). Of 123 AES cases, only 35 were laboratory confirmed as Japanese encephalitis (JE). Of 23 deaths, 8 had JE, and 15 had other diseases. I quote from the report: "Health officials claim to have undertaken [a] massive immunization drive in the district to prevent [spread of] the deadly disease. But the claims have fallen flat after the outbreak of the disease, which took almost epidemic form."

Churchill's statement on the war situation fits the AES situation perfectly: "It is a riddle wrapped in mystery inside an enigma, but perhaps there is a key." I know that immunization against JE had been on a very large scale. Disturbingly, several JE-vaccinated children have had laboratory confirmed JE. Some among them have died. The outbreak, in spite of widespread immunization, does not disprove the claim of immunization, as there are genuine vaccine failure cases. However, in the absence of public health surveillance, quantified and validated data are not available. Moreover, the great majority of AES cases were not JE.

Two very relevant questions have been raised in the most recent issue of Lancet Infectious Diseases. One (DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(15)00402-8) is that counterfeit drugs and vaccines are prevalent; I hope that the national immunization programme has adequate quality checks, but it is quite possible that spurious vaccine could enter the supply chain. This needs careful study and supervision. A colleague from Nepal tells me that vaccine failure is virtually zero there.

The 2nd (DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(15)00405-3) is that all so-called laboratory-proven JE may not be JE at all. The positive predictive value of some of the currently recommended confirmatory tests, particularly detection of anti-IgM antibody, even in cerebrospinal fluid, may be false positive, as many cases have other infections with bacteria, fungi, or viruses.

There is a key to the riddle: where JE is prevalent, health management must be modernized with quality assurance of medical care, reliable laboratory support service, public health surveillance, and problem-solving research in medical colleges. The very tendency to club any and all brain disease as AES, even in medical colleges, illustrates the need for professionalism in public health and medical care.

[ProMED thanks Dr. John for his comments.

Dr. John has again called for an integrated approach for surveillance with adequate laboratory support and dissemination of information that emerges to clinicians and to public health authorities as guidance for patient treatment and JE vaccination efforts. He also reiterates the need for more specific diagnosis of the etiology or etiologies of AES, since JE virus infections have been excluded in many cases, as noted in his comments and previous ProMED-mail posts. Those previous ProMED-mail posts have implicated Reye syndrome, consumption of lychees, and heat stroke, as well as JE virus infections, as responsible for AES. Prevention and control of AES will be difficult until there is a clear indication of the etiologies involved in these cases.
