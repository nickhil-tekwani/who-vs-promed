The deadly virus which killed 164 Taiwan children in the summer has
re-surfaced, infecting about 1,000 youngsters and killing at least
three, authorities said Wednesday.
[These are cases of hand, foot & mouth disease with complications
- Mod.JW
At least three children have died in the past week from suspected
enterovirus (EV) 71, and dozens of children are hospitalised.
The Department of Health (DOH) said EV-71 has made a comeback in
Pingtung and Kaohsiung counties in South Taiwan. "It may be because
schools have opened and affected children have brought the disease to
school," DOH official Hsu Kuo-hsiung said.
Other cities and counties have also reported suspected EV-71 cases,
showing the epidemic is not confined to the South.
EV-71 occurs in warm, unclean and heavily-populated places. Victims
develop blisters on their feet and mouths and [some die from heart
and lung failure.
The virus - which has several forms including Coxsackie virus B -
usually strikes children under five.
[This last statement is incorrect. It should say "Hand, foot and
mouth disease is caused by several viruses, including Coxsackie virus
B" - Mod.JW
