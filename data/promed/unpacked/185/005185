Five European countries have reported _Salmonella_ infections with at least some of them linked to tahini and halva from Syria. Up to 80 people may have been affected since 2019 in Germany, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and the Netherlands with several types of _Salmonella_ being linked to the outbreak.

Based on epidemiological information and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analyses, experts from the Robert Koch Institut (RKI) in Germany told Food Safety News that they consider cases with the _Salmonella_ serovars Mbandaka, Havana, Amsterdam, and Orion to be part of the outbreak.

Germany has 51 patients, with 49 confirmed by WGS, plus 2 with an epidemiological link to a WGS-confirmed case. This includes 21 in 2019, 12 in 2020, and 18 in 2021. RKI officials said they initially noted an increase in _Salmonella_ Havana case numbers in 2019 but were unable to identify the source of infection. Those patients have been retrospectively linked to the current outbreak based on WGS results. Whole-genome sequencing provides so-called fingerprints of bacteria, identifying matches between patients and specific pathogens.

Reported illness onset dates range from January 2019 to May 2021. There are a few possible people sick with onset dates in June 2021, which are not yet WGS confirmed. The age of cases ranges from 6 months to 69 years, and 53% are female. They live across Germany in 15 of 16 federal states.

Norway has 2 patients with _Salmonella_ Mbandaka who reported eating sesame seed products. They are 5 and 45 years old, both female and from different regions of the country. Sampling dates of the isolates were March 2020 and June 2021. Sesame seed products Al Burj Tahina and Al Burj Halwa from Syria and imported into Norway were recalled earlier this month [July 2021]. "Best before" dates range from June 2021 to January 2022. The recall is based on detection of _Salmonella_ in testing by Sweden and preliminary results from samples by Mattilsynet. Examinations are ongoing to see if the recalled products in Norway are contaminated with _Salmonella_ Mbandaka.

Sweden is investigating 2 clusters of _Salmonella_ Mbandaka and _Salmonella_ Havana with 11 cases each. In total, the 22 patients are spread across 10 different regions with the 1st reported in May 2019 and the latest in June 2021. The gender distribution is even, and the age range is 0-77 years old, but 12 cases are children under the age of 5.

Sharing of sequence data from _Salmonella_ isolates on an EU system for public health experts show a connection to previous outbreaks with a link to sesame-based products. Rikard Dryselius, a microbiologist at Folkhalsomyndigheten (the Public Health Agency of Sweden), said: "Sampling and analysis carried out by Livsmedelsverket (the Swedish Food Agency) has led to findings of _Salmonella_ in several products of tahini and halva. The isolates of _Salmonella_ are currently being sequenced to reveal the serotypes and if there is a connection to human cases. There are possibly also serotypes other than _Salmonella_ Havana and _Salmonella_ Mbandaka involved."

Denmark has 2 cases of _Salmonella_ Mbandaka that are related to the outbreak. They are from February 2021 and include one child and one adult.

The Netherlands has identified one matching _Salmonella_ Mbandaka case based on whole-genome sequencing. The affected person is a 1.5-year-old child with the sample being taken on 21 Mar this year [2021].

[Tahini is a paste made from raw sesame seeds. Other products made from sesame seeds include hummus (together with chickpeas) and halvah.

Previous outbreaks of salmonellosis have been associated with food products produced from sesame seeds. In a previous ProMED posting (Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 - Australia, Europe 20010822.1980), between 1985 and 2001, the National Enteric Pathogen Surveillance Scheme (NEPSS) in Australia had recorded the isolation of 17 different _Salmonella_ spp. from sesame seeds and sesame seed products, including hummus, tahini, and halvah, on 30 occasions.

Sesame seed products should be always be considered when attempting to identify a source of salmonellosis. - Mod.LL
