The Ministry of Health (MOH) and various agencies are investigating the increase in cases of Group B streptococcus (GBS) infection, which has been linked with the consumption of raw fish, the ministry said on Monday (Jul 13 [2015]).

One of the larger hospitals in Singapore saw an average of about 53 cases of GBS infection each year in the past 5 years, with a range of 31 to 73 cases a year. However, it has treated about 76 cases so far this year [2015] and in 10 of these cases, recent consumption of raw fish was reported, MOH said in reply to queries by Channel NewsAsia. "Investigations are ongoing as to the reason(s) for the increase in cases," the ministry added.

Doctors say this figure could well be just the tip of the iceberg because the data excludes numbers from private hospitals. And unlike more serious diseases, like tuberculosis, it is not compulsory for doctors to report cases of GBS infection.

"This disease can hurt the individual who is unwell. But if you take into context the whole population of Singapore, only a small, few numbers fall very, very, sick," said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious diseases specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. "Yes, we have had patients with permanent disability and even deaths from this illness. So contextualizing it, the actual risk is very, very small, but should you get the infection, it could be quite serious and even life-threatening."

Earlier on Monday [13 Jul 2015], MOH said it was aware of a message circulating claiming that there has been an outbreak of GBS due to consumption of contaminated raw fish. The message said all the people who had taken ill had consumed "yusheng", a popular dish at hawker centres, where raw fish is marinated in sesame oil and garnished with red chili and ginger.

GBS is a mild germ that lives in the human body and does not usually affect healthy people. However, at least one healthy male has been struck with severe GBS infection. His wife said he ate raw fish late last month [June 2015]. A few days later, the 52-year-old came down with high fever and painful joints. A trip to their family doctor did not help, and he was later warded because his joints hurt till he could not move. His knee swelled up to twice its size. He went through 2 rounds of surgery to drain the fluid and doctors confirmed the case as a GBS infection.

[His wife] said she was shocked to see how her quickly her husband's health worsened. Doctors said this is what is so unusual about the new strain. "It is able to evade the immune system," said Dr Leong. "The usual methods in which the immune system blocks it off it is able to evade and go into the system a little bit faster. I do not think we will find a cure for it, but we probably may be able to find the source of it. If we can shut down the source, everything should be fine."

Doctors are now collecting samples from patients and coming up with standard questions to ask patients with symptoms of GBS infection. At the same time, food supply companies are stepping up efforts to ensure their products are safe for consumption. One company uses chilled water -- below 6 C [42 F] -- to wash fish in the belief that it reduces chances of bacterial growth. All food handlers are also required to be registered with the National Environment Agency and undergo stringent food handling courses.

Group B streptococcus [GBS] bacteria do not usually cause disease in healthy individuals, says the Ministry of Health, in response to a widely circulated post on social media claiming there is "surge" in the number people falling ill after eating contaminated raw fish.

MOH said it is aware of a message circulating claiming there has been an outbreak of Group B streptococcus due to consumption of contaminated raw fish. The message, which appeared to have originated from a widely shared Facebook post claimed: "For the past few weeks, hospitals island-wide have been noticing a surge of young and old men who have been coming in sick with fever and painful swollen joints."

The message said all the people who had taken ill had consumed "yusheng", a popular dish at hawker centres, where raw fish is marinated in sesame oil and garnished with red chili and ginger.

"GBS is a common bacterium that colonises the human gut and urinary tract. It does not usually cause disease in healthy individuals," said MOH in a Facebook post. "However, in adults, GBS may occasionally cause infections of the skin, joints, heart and brain. The risk factors for GBS infection include underlying chronic or co-morbid conditions."

But an expert said the bacteria can be transferred to fish. "Only human beings have this kind of bacteria, so if food handlers have this bacteria and they handle fish products -- raw fish products -- this bacteria can transmit from food handlers to the fish products," explained Professor Yuk Hyun-gyun, from the National University of Singapore. The Health Ministry, the National Environment Agency and Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore are investigating the message, MOH said.

A stall helper at Maxwell Market said the authorities collected raw fish samples from them, as well as other stalls, on Monday [13 Jul 2015] afternoon.

[Group B streptococci (GBS), also called _Streptococcus agalactiae_, are gram-positive cocci that produce beta-hemolysis when cultured on sheep blood agar. They are further classified into several serotypes based on the antigenic specificity of their capsular polysaccharide. GBS colonize the vagina and gastrointestinal tract in healthy women, with carriage rates ranging from 15-45 percent. GBS can cause chorioamnionitis and post-partum endometritis and sepsis in pregnant women and pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis in newborns following vaginal delivery in mothers with vaginal GBS colonization at the time of delivery. GBS have been found to colonize the urethra in both men and women and can also colonize the gastrointestinal tract and upper respiratory tract; they are increasingly recognized as an invasive pathogen in diabetics and the elderly, causing sepsis, pneumonia, skin and soft-tissue infection (e.g., decubitus ulcers and diabetic foot infections), urinary tract infections, endocarditis, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, meningitis, peritonitis, and endo-ophthalmitis (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/41/6/839.long).

Although food-borne illness due to GBS has not previous been described, from my brief review of the literature, another beta-hemolytic streptococcus, group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS), was a common cause of food-borne GABHS pharyngitis, through ingestion of raw milk, often originating from cows with streptococcal mastitis
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2869736/pdf/11693494.pdf). Since pasteurization of milk has become a common practice and the refrigerated storage conditions of food have improved, food-borne spread of GABHS pharyngitis has become rare, and milk has ceased to be the major vehicle for this infection. GABHS is now usually transmitted from person-to-person via respiratory droplets or by skin contact.

Food-borne GABHS outbreaks are still reported on occasion, caused by contamination of food items during preparation by food handlers who either had pharyngitis, infected skin lesions on their hands/arms, or were asymptomatic carriers, and the food was frequently allowed to stand at room temperature for several hours between preparation and consumption (http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/technical-documents/articles/analytix/streptococci-overview.html#sthash.NAGD7PBX.dpuf).

Although GBS continues to be a major cause of mastitis in dairy cattle (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1576741/), the strains of GBS that cause disease in humans are reported to be biochemically, metabolically or serologically different from strains that cause animal disease (http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/streptococcosis.pdf). GBS infection in humans is thought to be transmitted person-to-person, from colonized asymptomatic human carriers. Whether GBS can cause food-borne illness remains to be determined.

More information on the reported outbreak of GBS disease in Singapore would be greatly appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
