As many as 13 students have been reportedly affiliated with chickenpox at Madarsa Syed Aadm, near Banur village, raising fear of an epidemic in the locality. Sources said all children in the grip of the disease were in the age group of 6-12 years.

The Health Department said that according to the survey and case history, the 1st case of chickenpox was reported on [11 Nov 2017]. The child was sent back to his native place in Saharanpur.

A team of the Health Department after screening the students on [Mon 11 Dec 2017] found that 13 students out of 41 enrolled in the madarsa were infected with the disease. The affected students are 6 to 12 year old children.

A teacher from the madarsa took them to the Civil Hospital, Banur, and came to know that the students were suffering from chickenpox. The hospital authorities soon informed the Civil Surgeon at Mohali and then the information was passed on to the district epidemiologist, who reached the area with a rapid response team.

Madarsa principal Mohammad Shahzad said, "All affected students were discharged from the Civil Hospital after getting supportive treatment and have been shifted to a separate room as a precautionary measure."

Harpreet Oberoi, SMO, Banur, said, "The children had complained of redness, itchy rashes on the skin spreading to almost everywhere on the body. But no case of high fever was reported following which they were discharged after the treatment."

Rita Bhardwaj, Civil Surgeon, Mohali, told The Tribune that she had sent a team comprising district epidemiologists and health workers to the school.

Meanwhile, a 4-year-old girl from Peer Muchalla reportedly suffering from chickenpox was brought to the CHC Dhakoli on [Tue 12 Dec 2017]. Sources said the girl had complained of rashes with fever.

Chickenpox cases have been detected in rural areas of Agra district fueling fears that more people may contract this highly contagious virus. According to health department officials, 9 members of a family at Jaitpur block were found to be afflicted with chickenpox.

A few cases have been detected in Bah block as well. Medical teams have been dispatched to these areas to monitor the cases at local community health centres (CHC) and prevent an outbreak of the disease.

Chickenpox is an airborne disease that is characterized with skin rash that forms small, itchy blisters, which eventually scab over. The rash is accompanied by fever and headaches. The virus spreads by coughs and sneezes of an infected person as also by shingles. Normally, the disease is not fatal and lasts for about 2 weeks.

According to health officials, a 17-year-old resident of Ashok Nagar in Bah block, visited the CHC on [Fri 8 Dec 2017]. She had rashes all over her body and complained of pain and fever. The doctor diagnosed her as suffering from chickenpox. Some other patients with chickenpox-like symptoms also visited the CHC.

In Jaitpur block, [a man] informed the health officers that many of his family members had rashes and were suffering from fever. A medical team visited his house and found that 9 members of his family were suffering from chickenpox.

Talking with TOI [Times of India], Dr Mukesh Vats, chief medical officer (CMO), said, "When we got to know about some suspicious cases of chickenpox, we sent our team to Bah and Jaitpur. We found some positive cases of chickenpox. We have instructed our teams to counsel the patients along with local residents about precautions to be taken and ways to prevent the disease from spreading. We have instructed all CHCs to examine suspected chickenpox cases carefully and report to our office on a daily basis."

Health officials say there's been an uptick in the number of cases of chickenpox they've seen this year [2017] -- something they haven't seen since 2013.

The Minnesota Department of Health spokesperson Doug Schultz said there has been 390 cases of chickenpox reported to the department this year [2017]. This is the highest number of cases the state department has seen since 2013, when 478 cases were reported.

Schultz said there is currently an outbreak of 15 cases of chickenpox in 1 school in Hennepin County and an outbreak of 6 cases in Stearns County. There have been 105 cases of chickenpox reported so far this year in Hennepin County, he said.

Most outbreaks typically occur in charter or private schools, Schultz said, where there is a higher percentage of unvaccinated children. But the "vast majority of cases are individual, sporadic cases or small clusters of 2 or 3 that are linked."

There's no "chickenpox season," Schultz said. Unlike the flu, chickenpox can appear throughout the year.

[Children who have never had chickenpox should get 2 doses of chickenpox vaccine at these ages: 1st dose: 12-15 months of age, 2nd dose: 4-6 years of age (may be given earlier, if at least 3 months after the 1st dose). People 13 years of age and older (who have never had chickenpox or received chickenpox vaccine) should get 2 doses at least 28 days apart.

Varicella vaccine can be given in combination with measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) to people 12 years of age and younger, or separately. The 1st dose of MMRV vaccine has been associated with rash and higher rates of fever than MMR and varicella vaccines given separately. Rash has been reported in about 1 person in 20 and fever in about 1 person in 5. Seizures caused by a fever are also reported more often after MMRV. These usually occur 5-12 days after the 1st dose.
