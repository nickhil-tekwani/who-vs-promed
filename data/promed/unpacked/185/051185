[Note from Moderator CHC: I am reposting this as cholera (? = unconfirmed) in
Indonesia. The original posting indicated the outbreak in East Java was due
to dengue but there seems to have been some confusion as to the meaning of
the local term for dengue and the meaning of the local term for cholera. As
you can see from Jack Woodall's footnoted comment, Indonesia is not listed as
an infected area for cholera as of 10 Apr 1997 in the list published in the
WHO WER (Weekly Epidemiological Record) dated 11 Apr 1997. If this is
cholera we ought to say so, hence this posting. Of course, we do not know
that this is cholera and would appreciate it if someone knowledgeable would
let us know what's what.

JAKARTA (Feb. 1) - Outbreaks of dengue fever (known locally as "Muntaber")
have killed 24 people in Sumenep, Madura island, East Java since November
last year, an Indonesian official said today. Doctors have been called to
stand by to anticipate possible fast spread.
It has infected 121 people since last December in Sumenep.

The information posted as "Dengue - Indonesia (East Java)" is not correct.
"Muntaber" is an abbreviation for "muntah berak" and is usually used to
describe clinical cholera. Dengue is known in Indonesian as "demam
berdarah". I have no specific information about the Madura island outbreak.

[This linguistic misunderstanding might help clarify the reason the
Government of Indonesia has called in additional physicians "to anticipate
possible fast spread". -- Mod CHC
[Indonesia is not listed as an Infected Area for cholera as at 10 Apr 1997
in the list published in the WHO WER (Weekly Epidemiological Record) dated
11 Apr 1997. Perhaps another of our subscribers in Indonesia has some
further information? - Mod.JW
