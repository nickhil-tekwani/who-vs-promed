Influenza Update No. 218
------------------------
Summary
-------
Globally influenza activity continued to increase in the southern hemisphere, and remained low elsewhere.
- In Europe and North America, overall influenza activity remained at inter-seasonal levels.
- In Africa and western Asia, influenza activity was low.
- In eastern Asia, influenza activity reached inter-seasonal levels in most countries with influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B virus predominating. Influenza A(H3N2) activity continued in south China.
- In the southern hemisphere, influenza activity continued to increase in most countries. In the temperate zone of South America, influenza activity mainly associated with A(H3N2) virus continued to increase, while respiratory syncytial virus activity declined. In Australia and New Zealand, the influenza season appeared to have started with ILI and the number of influenza virus detections increased. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was the most common detected virus. In South Africa the influenza detection rate increased with A(H3N2) the most frequently detected.
- Based on FluNet reporting (as of 25 Aug 2014, 11:25 UTC), during weeks 31 to 32 (27 Jul 2014 to 9 Aug 2014), National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 51 countries, areas or territories reported data. The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 26 644 specimens. 4014 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 3645 (90.8 percent) were typed as influenza A and 368 (9.2 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 534 (16.8 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 2636 (83.2 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 37 (94.9 percent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 2 (5.1 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

Countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
North America, Europe, Northern Africa and the Western and Central Asia region
- In the majority of the countries in the northern hemisphere influenza activity was at inter-seasonal levels.
- In Mexico, influenza levels remained low, but activity was higher than the expected levels for inter-seasonal influenza. Of the cases identified, most were influenza B.

Eastern Asia
- In the eastern Asian region, influenza activity remained low with influenza A(H3N2) as the main virus in circulation.
- In southern China, influenza activity decreased compared to previous weeks, but was still high in comparison to previous years. The influenza virus detections reported were mostly influenza A(H3N2) with some influenza B.
- In northern China, Japan, Mongolia and the Republic of Korea, influenza activity reached inter-seasonal levels.

Countries in the tropical zone
------------------------------
Tropical countries of the Americas/Central America and the Caribbean
- Overall in this region, influenza activity remained low. An increased circulation of influenza B was observed in several countries of the Caribbean and Central America, including Honduras, Jamaica, and Nicaragua, with influenza A co-circulation reported in Guatemala (A, not subtyped) and Panama (A(H1N1)pdm09).
- Tropical countries of South America, reported influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) activity within the expected range. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) continued to predominate in most countries of the subregion but influenza activity still detected, especially in the Plurinational State of Bolivia. The Plurinational State of Bolivia reported mainly influenza A(H3N2) and influenza A(H1N1)pmd09 detections over the last few weeks.
- In Brazil, influenza activity occurred in the southern region where influenza A(H3N2) viruses were predominant. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) continued to circulate at a higher level.

Central African tropical region
- In Africa, influenza activity reported from most countries in eastern, middle and western Africa was at low levels.
- Madagascar reported an increase in influenza activity, mainly due to influenza A (unsubtyped) and some cases of influenza B viruses.

Tropical Asia
- In most southern Asian and South-Eastern Asian countries, activity declined or remained low.
- In Lao People's Democratic republic and Viet Nam some influenza activity was reported, but at low levels.
- Thailand reported mainly influenza B activity, which remained at intermediate level.
- India reported influenza activity, due mostly to influenza A(H3N2) and some influenza B. Bhutan also reported some influenza activity, with an increase in cases of influenza B and some influenza A(H3N2) virus detected.

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
Temperate Zone of South America
- In the temperate zone of South America, influenza activity continued to increase, while RSV and ILI activity declined. Influenza A(H3N2) is the most frequently detected influenza virus with some co-circulation of influenza A(H1N1)pmd09.
- In Chile, ILI activity as well as number of influenza detections increased slightly compared to the previous week. RSV predominated among SARI cases, accounting for 48 percent of the positive respiratory samples, followed by influenza (5 percent). 81 percent of the influenza viruses detected were influenza A(H3N2) and 21 percent influenza B.
- In Paraguay, the ILI consultation rate remained similar to the previous week and remained at high levels (alert zone). The proportion of SARI-associated hospitalizations decreased in the last weeks. The percentage of influenza positive specimens increased further 93.7 percent of the influenza viruses were influenza A and 6.3 percent were influenza B.

South Africa
- In South Africa, influenza detection increased compared to the previous week, with influenza A(H3N2) as the most prevalent subtype and some cases of influenza B.

Oceania, Melanesia and Polynesia
- In both Australia and New Zealand, ILI activity and the number of influenza detections have increased. The most frequently detected virus was influenza A(H1N1)pmd09. Australia ILI activity and the notification of laboratory confirmed cases have shown an increase in the last few weeks; however, overall activity was lower compared to the previous year and consistent with the expected seasonal trend. In New Zealand, the ILI consultation rate was slightly above the seasonal threshold. Out of 824 respiratory samples tested, 231 (30 percent) were positive for influenza, with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 the most frequently detected influenza virus.
- In the Pacific Islands, ILI activity was variable with a decreasing trend observed in several islands. ILI activity however increased in American Samoa, Niue, Kiribati, Samoa, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.

[The southern hemisphere influenza epidemic is now in full swing, although relatively constrained in Oceania. No antigenically novel strains have made their appearance, and the current vaccines remain well matched. Surprisingly, RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) ranks alongside influenza as a major cause of respiratory disease to an increasingly large extent in parts of South America. - Mod.CP
