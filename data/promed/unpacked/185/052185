Canada's latest outbreak of bovine tuberculosis in domestic cattle involves a strain of TB bacteria not related to any previously seen in Canadian livestock or wildlife.

Culture testing of bacteria taken from a cow confirmed as TB-positive in November [2018] shows it's "not related to past cases of bovine TB in Alberta or British Columbia [BC] or anywhere else in Canada," the Canadian Food Inspection Agency said on [Wed 9 Jan 2019].

The agency also said on [Wed 9 Jan 2019] it has now tested the "majority" of animals from that infected cow's home herd in BC's southern Interior, and has so far turned up 3 more TB-positive cattle in that herd.

No part of any of the 4 infected cattle ever entered the food chain, the agency said.

Federal chief veterinary officer Dr. Jaspinder Komal, on a conference call with reporters on [Wed 9 Jan 2019], said the genetic type of the B.C. cow's TB strain also does not match the one seen in Canada's most recent previous bovine TB probe, nor any other isolates found in Canada.

That previous bovine TB probe -- launched on the September 2016 discovery of a southern Alberta cow with the disease -- also involved a strain never previously seen in Canadian livestock, wildlife or people but which was "closely related" to a strain originating from cattle in central Mexico in 1997.

Asked whether the BC cow's strain is connected to any seen in the U.S. or abroad, Komal replied that to CFIA's "very preliminary" knowledge, the strain doesn't appear to match any yet seen in Canada or the U.S.

The infected BC cattle's home premises remain under movement controls, CFIA said, as do 10 other premises in BC, 13 in Alberta and one in Saskatchewan, affecting a total of 18 000 animals. No herds in this probe have yet been released from movement controls.

The current investigation, run jointly by CFIA and the BC government, began after the 1st infected cow was presented for slaughter at a federally-registered facility on [26 Oct 2018]. Post-mortem examination found lesions in that animal's lymph nodes, lungs and liver; the carcass was then condemned and bovine TB was lab-confirmed on [9 Nov 2018].

A federally reportable livestock disease, bovine TB has been subject to a mandatory nationwide eradication program since 1923.

[Tuberculosis is a slow insidious disease. Depending on how advanced the lesions are it can be a tough call. The inspectors are to be congratulated. Veterinary inspectors are one of our 1st lines of defense for meat safety. The meat inspectors at the slaughter plant, the front line of detection and prevention will need to be very careful and thorough in their inspections. Inspectors are the front line of preventing diseases such as this from entering the food chain. While we all want cheap, rapid access to quality products, it is very unwise to run a slaughter line so fast the inspectors are not able to do a diligent thorough job, especially when a new strain of disease is prevalent, or any disease needing detecting.

In November 2018, we were hopeful this was an isolated case, but it takes time to test herds of cattle and do trace-ins and trace-outs (animals moving into or out of a herd) to determine where movements and exposure may have occurred.

Now we know it is not necessarily a single issue but involves more than 1 animal, but hopefully not more than 1 herd. Tracing a new disease back to its origin is one issue, but testing and tracing for a very slow growing disease is quite a longer matter. - Mod.TG
