Concerning the questions of Dr. Meyer from Singapore on rabies PET in
previously vaccinated individuals, I would like to add some information to
the response of Henry Wilde.
In the rabies treatment Center at the Pasteur Institute, we apply PET in
exposed individuals, and we give pre-exposure vaccination to persons who
are at increased risk for rabies exposure and to travelers as well.
Particularly, we monitor rabies pre-exposure vaccinations of the staff
involved in rabies and rabies related viruses research in a number of
laboratories. We often have to manage iterative exposures, whether
laboratory exposures or bites, in previously immunized individuals who had
received either pre- or post-exposure immunization.
First, we always give a booster dose after each known exposure, whatever
the antibody titer of the patient. In laboratory staff, we titrate rabies
antibodies at the same time. As a matter of fact, in this population, whose
antibodies against rabies are tested every 6 months, we usually give only
one booster, as titers are very high. Nevertheless, newly immunized
subjects sometimes need 2 injections. In patients who had received previous
PET, or who had received pre-exposure vaccination, we perform a titration
whenever we have any doubt concerning the vaccine, the schedule, or the
immunocompetence of the patient (concomitant diseases, medications like
antimalarials or corticosteroids...). We give as many injections as
necessary.
In our experience, immunological response to rabies vaccines, as measured
by EIA or neutralizing antibodies is variable according to different
individuals. Monitoring the antibody response of exposed individuals is not
as constraining as monitoring all pre-exposure immunized subjects. As far
as hypersensitivity reactions are concerned, they occurred with HDCV only.
As for example, since we use the PVRV (Purified Vero Rabies Vaccine), we do
not see them any more.
Second, when we give pre-exposure immunization to travelers, we tell them
that in case of exposure to a rabid or rabies suspected animal, they must
get booster doses, whenever this exposure occurs. Pre-exposure immunization
consists of 3 IM doses, (day 0, 7, 21 or 28), a booster one year later,
and every 5 years.

[We have a number of questions out awaiting clarification and answers by
recognised experts. So would those not seeing "answers" to their questions,
please be patient ... and those with the referred questions please let me
have their views ASAP. By doing this we hope to keep the volume down. -
