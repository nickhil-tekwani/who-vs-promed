Japanese Encephalitis 1st Patient Found In Pune City
----------------------------------------------------
On 3 Nov 2022, a 4-year-old boy was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit of Sassoon General Hospital. At the time of admission, the child was showing symptoms of fever, headache, weakness, and fits. Accordingly, various tests were conducted, the patient was treated, and his blood and CSF samples were sent to the National Institute of Virology, Pune. Dr Vinayak Kale, Director of Sassoon General Hospital, Pune, said, "The National Institute of Virology, Pune, on 29 Nov 2022, reported that the patient's report in the said case was positive for Japanese encephalitis.

Dr Aarti Kinikar, Professor and Head of the Department of Pediatrics, informed, "The child was kept on a ventilator for 9 days, and along with that, the necessary medicines were started. After 17 days of intensive care, he was admitted to the board for further treatment."

"Also, this disease is usually found in children under 15 years of age, and the symptoms of the patient are fever, headache, weakness, and fits," she added further.

Japanese encephalitis is a mosquito-borne disease. The young boy is the 1st patient with the disease in Pune city, but this disease is not contagious and is caused only by the bite of certain mosquitoes, so there is no reason for Pune residents to panic, informed Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC).

The disease infects the lining of the brain, and the main symptoms are fever, neck pain, and vomiting. Some patients may become unconscious if they suffer too much. The disease is caused by a mosquito called _Culex_. This mosquito breeds in dirty water.

[This is a single Japanese encephalitis (JE) case that has occurred late in the transmission season. Presumably, the affected child had not been vaccinated against JE. Historically, JE cases have been relatively uncommon in Maharashtra state. However, in 2017 things were different, with 26 cases. The reasons for the increased case numbers in that year and expansion into areas not considered endemic was undefined but probably was due to an increase in vector mosquito populations, or increases in numbers of reservoir bird hosts, or of pigs, the amplifying hosts. The _Culex_ mosquito vectors can become very abundant seasonally, breeding in wetlands. Vector control is difficult. There have been relatively few JE cases since 2017. - Mod.TY
