Date submitted to OIE: 20 Apr 2010
Reason for notification: reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: May 2000
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: foot and mouth disease virus
Serotype: pending
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to the whole country

New outbreaks
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Tsuno-cho, Koyu-gun, Miyazaki [Kyushu Island]
Date of start of the outbreak: 7 Apr 2010
Outbreak status: continuing
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected animals
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 16 / 3 / 0 / 16 / 0

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: a private veterinarian first found a suspicious
case in the affected farm and reported it to the local government's
veterinary service on 9 Apr 2010. An official veterinarian observed that a
cow had fever, anorexia, salivation, and erosions in the oral cavity on the
same day but the others had no clinical signs. Since other 2 suspicious
cases were found in the same farm on 16 Apr 2010, the veterinary service
examined similar diseases such as bluetongue, bovine viral
diarrhoea-mucosal disease (BVD-MD), infectious bovine rhinotracheitis and
Ibaraki disease but they showed negative results by PCR tests on 19 Apr
2010. The veterinary service submitted the samples to the National
Institute for Animal Health (NIAH) on the same day. The NIAH affirmed the
cattle were infected with foot-and-mouth disease virus [FMDV] by PCR test
on 20 Apr 2010. The samples are being examined by virus isolation. If it is
confirmed, it will be the 1st outbreak of FMD in Japan since 2000.

All cattle in the affected farm were destroyed. Disinfection of affected
premises is being implemented. Movement restrictions within 10 km [6 mi]
around the affected farm have been implemented. Export international
veterinary certificates for ruminants and products derived from them have
been suspended since 20 Apr 2010.

Control measures
Measures applied:
- stamping out;
- quarantine;
- movement control inside the country;
- disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s);
- vaccination prohibited;
- no treatment of affected animals.

Measures to be applied:
- screening

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: National Institute of Animal Health (National
laboratory)
Tests and results:
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Cattle / reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 20 Apr
2010 / positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[This PCR-diagnosed FMD case is, according to the notification, pending
confirmation by the virus isolation, which will be followed by serotyping.
FMDV serotype O is currently circulating in South Korea; earlier this year
(2010), serotype A was recorded in South Korea, eradicated by stamping out.
The possible source of infection, in Korea, is China where serotypes A, O,
and Asia 1 have been reported recently; serotype O, in particular, seems to
have spread widely in China. This serotype is characterised by the
potential to spread rapidly, affecting large and small ruminants, as well
as swine.

It may be assumed that the Japanese authorities are currently engaged with
efforts to trace back possible direct and indirect contacts between the
affected holding and other farms during at least the recent 3 weeks. This,
in view of the fact that the virus has probably been circulating on the
affected premises for at least 2-3 weeks before being identified and before
quarantine measures were applied.

Japan's FMD control policy, similarly to South Korea and all other
countries with the official status of being FMD-free, is based upon
stamping out with vaccination prohibited. Such countries can regain their
FMD-free status according to the OIE's International Animal Health Code,
provided the prescribed measures are successfully accomplished.

Final confirmation, serotyping, and genotyping of the agent, and
information on the possible source of infection are anticipated.
