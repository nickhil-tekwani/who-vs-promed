A comment
---------
In the previous post [Crimean-Congo hem. fever - Iran: (KV) abattoir
workers 20090907.3149] the moderator stated that: "Humans who become
infected with CCHF acquire the virus from direct contact with blood
or other infected tissues from livestock during this time, or they
may become infected from a tick bite."

The avenue of infection might be one or more of the unique aspects of
halal slaughter [permissible to use or engage in, according to
Islamic law], and the pre-and-post slaughtering procedures might have
to be amended to prevent such infections from becoming a recurring phenomenon.

The halal slaughter method inevitably involves more blood flying
around than the conventional western method, and because multiple
workers are having to physically hold the animal throughout the
slaughter process, there is huge opportunity for ticks to move from
the dying animal to the nearest living hosts -- the humans -- as well
as for the workers to have contact with blood.

For religious and cultural reasons, the halal slaughter method itself
is not open to change, but the risk of infection might be
substantially reduced if animals were dipped in an appropriate
solution prior to slaughter, if workers always wore protective
clothing to prevent direct bodily contact with animals, and if
something was done to reduce the accumulations of blood in the
slaughter areas, which are typically dependant on nothing more than
gravity for drainage.

More hosing would be an obvious response, except that in arid
climates such as Iran and Afghanistan, the necessary water might not
be available.

Either dipping or more hosing will be problematic in arid locations,
but probably many animals could wade through the same dipping tank,
so long as it was kept refreshed and skimmed to remove still living
ticks and tick carcasses.

My personal preference would be for people to quit eating meat, but I
know that isn't going to happen soon, especially not in those parts
of the world.
