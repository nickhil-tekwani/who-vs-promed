Several hundred birds have been destroyed in an on-going MAF investigation
into a possible outbreak of the psittacine (parrot) poxvirus.
Parrot breeders dispute whether the disease even exists in New Zealand.
Members of the Avian Disease Management Council, a group of breeders who
help deal with disease outbreaks, said this week parrot owners were now
afraid of reporting any illness in their birds and were being driven
underground.
The investigation began in July 2002 when 2 rosellas taken to an Auckland
veterinarian were diagnosed as having parrot pox, the first time the virus
had been officially recorded in New Zealand.
Government scientists say if the disease spreads it would have a disastrous
effect on caged and wild parrots, including native species such as the
kakapo, kaka and kea.
MAF linked the rosellas to 2 west Auckland properties and sought to destroy
the birds on them to prevent any possible further spread. The birds on one
of the properties were destroyed in October 2002. MAF has visited dozens
of properties as part of its investigations.
"We have no proof that the psittacine pox is in New Zealand," said Mr
Butler, the vice-president of the Aviculture Society.
MAF's national manager for surveillance and response, Allen Bryce, said the
ministry had to take a very cautious approach because it was important to
protect native species from any threat.

[Psittacine pox is a disease caused by poxviruses, many strains of which
that affect birds (avian poxviruses), and probably all birds are
susceptible to pox. Strains of poxviruses cause disease in specific types
of birds, for instance fowl pox in poultry and psittacine pox in parrots,
budgies, and other psittacines. Specific strains of psittacine poxvirus
will affect different species of psittacines in different ways. Strain
characteristics are determined either naturally or experimentally on the
basis of the effects in different species or families of birds. Psittacine
poxvirus does not infect humans.
There is a risk the virus will become established in the country as a
result of contact between infected captive birds and wild birds via biting
insects, or direct contact within the introduced wild parrot population.
The potential consequences for indigenous psittacines are of great concern;
their susceptibility to the strain that infected the rosellas is not known.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) website says the disease
could have severe adverse consequences on the critically endangered kakapo,
as well as affecting populations of indigenous parrots such as the kaka,
kea, and kakariki.

The most likely scenario is a high mortality rate when psittacine poxvirus
is introduced into a susceptible population that has not previously been
exposed. Extracted in part from the International Wildlife Rehabilitation
Council (IWRC) magazine:

There seems to be some dispute between bird owners and the officials of
MAF. There is not certainty or proof the disease exists in New
Zealand. Release of information on the official method of testing for
confirmation of the disease and the lab conducting the test could ease bird
owners' fear that MAF is targeting them rather than protecting the bird
population as a whole.- Mod.TG]
