[2] Nepal (Kathmandu)
Date: Thu 26 Jun 2014
From: Sher Bahadur Pun <drsherbdr@yahoo.com> [edited]


Over the past few weeks, patients with fever, body ache, flu-like symptoms, and joint pains have been increasingly seen in outpatient department (OPD) at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital (STIDH), Kathmandu, Nepal. Patients having symptoms compatible with dengue were sent for laboratory confirmation (rapid diagnostic test). Among them, 7 were IgM positive for dengue. Of these, a 35-year-old male was admitted to STIDH due to a high-grade fever, severe headache, vomiting, body ache, abdominal pain, cough, and shortness of breath. [None of the cases had] recent travel history to other parts of the country, suggesting that the 2014 dengue cases identified in Kathmandu could be due to indigenous transmission of dengue virus.

An entomological surveillance carried out by District Public Health Office (DPHO) in 2012, has found significant numbers of _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_ (primary vectors of dengue and chikungunya viruses) in Kathmandu, the most densely populated areas of Nepal.

Dengue was first reported in 2004, and chikungunya in 2013 in Nepal. The 1st major dengue outbreak occurred in 2010, and patients from 24 districts were admitted to this hospital (STIDH). Most doctors, however, are not well aware of dengue or chikungunya viruses, and hence do not include them in the differential diagnosis. There is, therefore, need for vigilance and close monitoring of patients having signs and symptoms compatible with dengue or chikungunya fevers considering arrival of monsoon rainy season in Nepal.

[This are the 1st confirmed cases of dengue virus infection in Kathmandu, although the virus has been in the country for at least 10 years. ProMED-mail thanks Dr Sher Bahadur Pun for sending this report. These kinds of 1st-hand reports are especially valuable.
