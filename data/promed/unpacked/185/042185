A single case of BSE diagnosed in Denmark
-------------------------------------------
On 28 February 2000 one case of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) has
been diagnosed in a Danish herd of milk cattle. This has happened only once
before in 1992. On this occasion a cow imported from the United Kingdom
(UK) was diagnosed and immediately incinerated. The present case concerns a
young cow, which spent its entire life on the same premises. It is at
present not known how the animal was infected. However, in the absence of
other positive evidence, contaminated feedstuff is the most likely source.
In that case, the animal in question has been infected in the last half of
1996. In the beginning of 1997 several improvements of control procedures
were enforced, e.g. in preventing ruminant exposure to meat-and-bone meal
(MBM) and in the operations of the rendering plants. It can therefore be
assumed that the possible exposure window has been relatively short.
The strongest measures have been taken to prevent spread of the disease to
other herds, i.e. the BSE-diagnosed animal will be sent for incineration,
and the whole herd will be slaughtered and incinerated - the veterinary
authorities have decided to enforce enhanced surveillance of cattle with
respect to any signs of BSE. The program covers both the ante- and
post-mortem inspection in slaughterhouses and the veterinary checks on
animal premises, the veterinary authorities will carry out targeted
surveillance programs on emergency slaughtered animals and fallen stock. If
possible, a cohort of potentially exposed cattle herds will be identified
for enhanced surveillance, based on the trace-back efforts using potential
feedstuff leads. Denmark has a very well developed registration system for
cattle, and all possibilities has been pursued to trace any movement of
cattle from the present herd to other herds. Due to this system it has been
established beyond doubt, that no animal has been moved out of the heard
for live purposes.
The Danish tradition of securing the highest level of veterinary safety
will be pursued by all means. Export of live animals and non-food products
of animal origin will be dealt with in accordance with existing provisions
in importing countries.
Consumer safety measures have been taken immediately, i.e.: export of beef
and other bovine products has been stopped in accordance with importing
countries BSE certificate-requirements. The meat industry has been ordered
to immediately withdraw any meat or meat product from the Danish market,
which may contain specified risk material. Specified risk material is
defined as brain, spinal cord, eyes, tonsils and ileum from cattle more
than 12 years old. Ileum and spleen from sheep and goats at all ages,
brain, spinal cord, eyes and tonsils from sheep and goats more then 12
months old
Examples of meat cuts involved are: T-bone, rib/short loin, chops and
entrecote, to the extent that these cuts are attached to bones of the
spinal column. The industry operating on the exporting markets are
instructed to inform trading partners of the Danish provisions.
Slaughtering procedures must be altered immediately so specified risk
material are removed from all cattle, goats and sheep slaughtered in
Denmark. The control authorities are instructed to pay special attention to
a correct implementation of the described measures.
Concerning the products covered it should be emphasized that the provisions
do not cover milk products. This is due to the fact that milk products do
not transmit BSE. The WHO has scientifically established this in its
communique 82 of 2-3 April 1996, which was confirmed in a second WHO
consultation report on BSE carried out 24-26 March 1997 (see internet
and search for BSE). Thus milk is not covered by any
particular provision related to the single BSE-case on the Danish market.
Further it is Danish understanding according to international rules on
trade the same conclusion should prevail on export-markets.
The OIE has been notified on the situation in Denmark. For any further
information, please contact the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration.
