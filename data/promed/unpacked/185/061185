CHYTRID FUNGUS, FROGS - WORLDWIDE: POSSIBLE RECOVERY

Frogs in Australia and the United States may be recovering from a
fungal disease that has decimated amphibian populations around the
world, researchers say.

Between 1990 and 1998, the populations of several frog species in
Australia plummeted due to chytridiomycosis infection, but a recent
survey suggests the frogs are re-establishing themselves,
NewScientist.com <http://www.newscientist.com/> reported Friday [10
Dec 2010]. "It's happening across a number of species," Michael
Mahony at the University of Newcastle in New South Wales says.

Barred river frogs, the tusked frog and several tree frog species
have returned to areas where they had almost disappeared, and some
species have even reached pre-infection levels, Australian
researchers say. There are also signs of recovery in the United
States.

Roland Knapp at the Sierra Nevada Aquatic Research Laboratory of the
University of California says mountain yellow-legged frogs, once
"driven virtually to extinction," are returning. The big question is,
are frogs now beating the fungal infection?

Knapp and Mahony have separately determined that recovering frogs are
living with low-level infections of the fungus. It is possible, they
say, the fungus has weakened in the areas where frogs are recovering.
There is also evidence the frogs are evolving, Knapp says.

At Vanderbilt University, researchers found a population of
Australian green-eyed tree frogs previously decimated by the fungus
produced more antimicrobial peptides, which inhibit fungal growth, on
their skin than a less affected population.

"It's quite likely that populations are adapting and developing
better defenses," Vanderbilt researcher Louise Rollins-Smith says.

[This is good news for all of us and for the frogs. Let us hope the
recovery of many species continues. We might wonder whether the
fungus is getting weaker, or perhaps there has been an adaptation to
overcome the fungus, and how much damage is being done to the
individuals living with a low level of the fungus. There are likely
many more questions that remain unanswered.

There are some species that have already been wiped out and are now
classified as extinct. Let us hope this is truly a recovery.
