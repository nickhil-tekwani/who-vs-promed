[The Agriculture Ministry said] bird flu has spread to another duck
farm in northern Viet Nam, killing 2120 fowl, which had not been
vaccinated against the H5N1 virus. Tests confirmed the H5 component
of the virus in the 14-day-old ducklings in the farm outside Haiphong
city last week [21-27 May 2007], the 2nd outbreak in the area, the
ministry's Animal Health Department said in a report [issued] on
Wednesday [30 May 2007].
Animal health workers slaughtered the remaining 1200 ducklings,
bringing to nearly 50 000 the total number of birds killed by the
virus and slaughtered this month [May 2007] around the country.
The virus has infected ducks and chickens in 9 provinces and Can Tho
city in May [2007,] at the beginning of summer, which is unusual as
experts say the virus appears to thrive best in cool temperatures and
weakens in warmer weather.
A 30-year-old man contracted the disease in northern Viet Nam,
doctors confirmed last week [21-27 May 2007], the 1st human infection
since November 2005.
Bird flu has killed 42 people in Viet Nam since it re-surfaced in
Asia in late 2003. The virus returned to poultry in the south late
last year [2006] and early this year [2007].
While more than half of Viet Nam's 64 provinces and cities have
completed the 1st phase of poultry vaccinations against bird flu, all
the infections found so far were among those which were left out of
the nationwide campaign.
Agriculture Minister, Cao Duc Phat, said on Tuesday [29 May 2007,]
that all waterfowl must be vaccinated or slaughtered to help stop
bird flu from spreading. [The Viet Nam News Agency reported that the
minister] told a government committee for bird flu that he and his
deputy, Bui Ba Bong, would supervise a new month-long campaign
against the disease starting on Friday [1 Jun 2007].

Fowls have died en masse in Viet Nam's central Quang Ngai province
and the 2 northern provinces of Thai Nguyen and Thanh Hoa over the
past few days, local media reported Wednesday [30 May 2007].
The fowls might have died [as a result of infection by] bird flu
virus strain H5, said Labor newspaper. Since early May [2007], nearly
50 000 ducks, chickens, and quails have either died or been culled
due to bird flu.
Bird flu, [which first struck] Viet Nam in December 2003, has hit 10
Vietnamese cities and provinces, namely Quang Ninh, Son La, Nam Dinh,
Hai Phong, Bac Giang, Ninh Binh, and Bac Ninh in the northern region,
Nghe An in the central region, and Can Tho and Dong Thap in the
southern region, since early this month [May 2007]. [An

A 30-year-old man of northern Vinh Phuc province, who exhibited bird
flu symptoms on [10 May 2007,] after slaughtering chickens for a
wedding party, has recently been confirmed by Viet Nam's Health
Ministry as the country's 1st bird flu patient since mid-November
2005. Not needing a respirator any more, he is now recovering at the
Bach Mai Hospital in Hanoi capital, said Pioneer newspaper.
To date, Viet Nam has reported a total of 94 human cases of bird flu
infections. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) has yet to
confirm the latest case.
