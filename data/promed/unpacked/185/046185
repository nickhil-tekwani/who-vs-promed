Vesicular stomatitis (VS) has been detected in 5 horses in far Southwest Texas, (in Kinney County, southeast of Del Rio, TX). The US Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) confirmed the viral infection of the 5 horses. The horses were tested after the owner observed blistering and swelling on the animals' muzzles and contacted their veterinary practitioner. Testing at the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) confirmed the virus as the New Jersey serotype.

VS can cause blisters and sores in the mouth and on the tongue, muzzle, teats, or hooves of horses, cattle, swine, sheep, goats, llamas, and a number of other animals. Lesions usually will heal in 2 or 3 weeks. Because of the contagious nature of VS and its resemblance to other diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), animal health officials urge livestock owners and caretakers to report these symptoms to their veterinarian immediately. Most animals recover well with supportive care by a veterinarian, but some lesions can be painful.

The newly identified infected group of horses is currently under quarantine by the TAHC. Affected and exposed horses will be monitored by regulatory veterinarians until all lesions have healed and a decision is made to release the quarantine (a minimum of 21 days). There is no known exposure to other horses around the state, or at any equine events. No other cases of VS have been identified in the immediate area or elsewhere in the state.

Dr Dee Ellis, Texas' State Veterinarian and TAHC Executive Director, said "Livestock owners should use the best means possible to limit exposure of their livestock to insect bites." It is thought that insects are an important vector in the transmission of VS. Sand flies and black flies likely play a role in the virus transmission, so controlling insects is important. "VS outbreaks are extremely sporadic and years may lapse between cases. The last confirmed case of VS in Texas was in 2009," Dr Ellis stated.

Some states and other countries may restrict movement of, or impose additional requirements for susceptible animals from states having known cases of VS, therefore contact the state or country of origin for their requirements prior to moving livestock.

"If you suspect your animal may have VS, you should notify your veterinarian immediately," said Dr Andy Schwartz, Assistant Executive Director and State Epidemiologist. "VS is not highly contagious to people but it can cause flu-like illness if infected saliva gets into an open wound, eyes, or mouth. People handling potentially infected animals should wear gloves for protection, and talk with their physician if they have questions," Dr Schwartz stated.

[Vesicular stomatitis (VS) virus is one of those interesting diseases that emerges every once in a while without much warning, until it bursts uninvited into our livestock population. It does not occur every year, but it has occurred almost yearly in the past several years.

There are 2 major serotypes: New Jersey and Indiana.

The problem with vesicular stomatitis is 2-fold. One, there is inevitably a disruption of production in cattle; not only will the sick animal produce less, but disease management tactics must be very stringent. The 2nd problem is that the clinical signs are similar to those of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), with which it can easily be confused (though horses are resistant to FMD and susceptible to VS).

In this case, the diagnosis of the disease in an equine first forestalls any worry about FMD, until an animal susceptible to FMD, such as a bovine, appears with similar clinical signs. Consequently, surveillance must be ever vigilant. Likewise, it seems that states will slam their doors shut to animals from a state that has experienced this disease.

VS can be transmitted by contamination by transcutaneous or transmucosal route and by arthropod transmission (_Phlebotomus_, _Aedes_, etc.). Incubation of the disease may be as long as 21 days.

According to the OIE, clinical signs can be summarized as follows:
- excessive salivation;
- blanched raised or broken vesicles of various sizes in the mouth:
Horses: upper surface of the tongue, surface of the lips and around nostrils, corners of the mouth, and the gums;
Cattle: tongue, lips, gums, hard palate, and sometimes muzzle and around the nostrils;
Pigs: snout
- lesions involving feet of horses and cattle are not exceptional;
- teat lesions occur in dairy herds;
- foot lesions and lameness are frequent in pigs;
- recovery in around 2 weeks;
- complication: loss of production and mastitis in dairy herds due to secondary infections, lameness in horses

The following information was obtained from APHIS- Veterinary Services Fact Sheet on Vesicular stomatitis (last update May 2012):
http://www.aphis.usda.gov/publications/animal_health/content/printable_version/fs_vesicular_stomatitis_2012.pdf

"Vesicular stomatitis (VS) is a viral disease that primarily affects horses and cattle and occasionally swine, sheep, goats, llamas, and alpacas. Humans can also become infected with the disease when handling affected animals, but this is a rare event. Vesicular stomatitis has been confirmed only in the Western Hemisphere.

It is known to be an endemic disease in the warmer regions of North, Central, and South America, but outbreaks of the disease in other temperate geographic parts of the hemisphere occur sporadically.

In the past decade, the Southwestern and Western United States have experienced a number of vesicular stomatitis outbreaks. Outbreaks usually occur during the warmer months, often along waterways. In some years, only a few premises in a single State have been affected. However, in other years, multiple States and many premises have been involved.

Since there could be a vesicular stomatitis outbreak in any given year, it is essential that veterinarians and livestock owners be on the alert for animals displaying clinical signs of the disease.

While vesicular stomatitis does not generally cause animals to die, it can still cause economic losses to livestock producers.

In horses, vesicular lesions generally occur on the upper surface of the tongue, the lips, around nostrils, corners of the mouth, and gums. Lesions in horses may also be expressed as crusting scabs on the muzzle, lips, or ventral abdomen.

How vesicular stomatitis spreads is not fully known; insect vectors, mechanical transmission, and movement of animals are all factors. Once the disease is introduced into a herd, it may move from animal to animal by contact or exposure to saliva or fluid from ruptured vesicles.

Humans rarely contract vesicular stomatitis, but they can become infected. In people, the disease causes an acute influenza-like illness with symptoms such as fever, muscle aches, headache, and malaise. To avoid exposure to this disease, individuals should use personal protective measures when handling affected animals.

There is no specific treatment or cure for vesicular stomatitis. Good sanitation and quarantine practices on affected farms usually contain the infection.

When a definite diagnosis is made on a farm, the following procedures are recommended:
- separate animals with lesions from healthy animals, preferably by stabling. Animals on pastures tend to be affected more frequently with this disease;
- as a precautionary measure, do not move animals from premises affected by vesicular stomatitis until at least 21 days after lesions in the last affected animal have healed;
- implement on-farm insect control programs that include the elimination or reduction of insect breeding areas and the use of insecticide sprays or insecticide-treated ear-tags on animals;
- use personal protective measures when handling affected animals to avoid human exposure to this disease." - Mod.CRD]
