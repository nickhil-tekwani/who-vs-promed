Lufkin skunk tests positive for rabies
--------------------------------------
City of Lufkin Animal Control personnel have confirmed that a skunk
found deceased in a Lufkin neighborhood was infected with rabies.

On Saturday, 27 Nov 27 2010, a skunk entered the fenced yard of a
residence located in the 1200 block of Reen Drive in Lufkin. When the
resident heard her dogs barking and saw the dogs chasing the skunk
through the yard, she quickly secured them inside of the house. The
following day, the deceased skunk was found in the yard. Although the
dogs' rabies vaccines are current and the resident believes no
physical contact occurred between the dogs and the skunk, the dogs
received a booster vaccine following the incident.

City of Lufkin Animal Control personnel retrieved the skunk and
testing at the Department of State Health Services Laboratory in
Austin found the skunk to be infected with rabies. According to Rhonda
McLendon, Director of City of Lufkin Animal Control, Angelina County
typically sees 2 to 3 rabies cases each year but between 2004 and
2009, all cases have involved bats. Director McLendon stated: "this is
the 1st Angelina County skunk to test positive for rabies since 2003,
when we had 14 rabies-positive skunk cases."

Horse rabies case reported in Crosby County
-------------------------------------------
The Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) reported Crosby
County had its first documented rabies case in 47 years in a horse.
This was the 3rd horse rabies case this year and the 30th horse case
in the 41 counties in DSHS' Region 1 to date, said Karen McDonald,
DSHS Zoonosis control specialist. Like the horse in Crosby County, the
other horse rabies cases were related to a strain of rabies
originating from a skunk.

In his 32 years as a veterinarian, Kody Kothmann of Caprock Veterinary
Clinic in Lubbock said he had never encountered a horse with rabies.
The horse was a white 3-year-old Morgan mare named Pearl that belonged
to residents of Lubbock. Pearl and another horse were kept on a ranch
south of Lorenzo, but on 15 Nov 2010, the owner noticed her horse was
acting strangely.

Pearl was not eating or drinking and was starting to lose weight, so
the owner's father contacted Kothmann. When Kothmann saw Pearl he
suspected rabies, he said, even though there was no visible bite on
the horse's body.

"The horse was losing 40 to 50 pounds a day," Kothmann said. "On the 3
days I observed the horse, it was deteriorating very quickly."

Pearl pressed her head against the wall and had flared nostrils,
hyper-excitability, twitching of both eyes and an inability to swallow
-- that was the sign she had facial nerve paralysis and most likely
rabies, he said.

By 18 Nov 2010 Pearl could no longer stand, so she was euthanized. Her
body was buried, and her brain was sent to the DSHS laboratory in
Austin for testing. The following week, DSHS confirmed Pearl's ailment
had been rabies. It was a difficult, costly, but important lesson for
the horse owner's family. Their other horse was vaccinated twice, but
DSHS told the family to keep it in quarantine for 90 days as a
precaution.

"I would highly recommend anyone with horses to get them vaccinated
... just like a dog or a cat," said the father, who made sure his
family and animals were all vaccinated. "Skunks are carriers, and it
is a risk."

Although the vaccination cost about USD 1000 [but see comment below],
he said it was worth it to avoid another tragic death. Dogs and cats
are required to get rabies vaccinations, but livestock and animals
that often come in contact with humans should be vaccinated regularly
as well, McDonald said.

Since 2004, there has not been a report of a horse rabies case in
Lubbock; Lubbock's most recently reported rabies case was a cat in
March [2010].

[There must be something here that the article has not clearly
communicated. A rabies vaccine for a horse does NOT cost USD 1000. The
vaccine itself is about USD 10. However, veterinarians are free to
charge the 'going rate' to make a house call. If the veterinarian
traveled many miles to vaccinate the horse, the veterinarians time and
mileage is often charged. But the vaccine itself does not cost that
amount. - Mod.TG]

[3] Fox, human exposure - Massachusetts

Bitten by a fox: Now what?
--------------------------
Just 5 days after a seemingly random fox attack, a pair of Bel Air
Avenue residents finally have an answer as to why. In 2 separate
incidents, one late Sunday night [28 Nov 2010] one early Monday
morning [29 Nov 2010], a woman and a man were stalked and attacked by
an aggressive fox. On Thursday [2 Dec 2010], they learned that the fox
was indeed rabid, according to test results from a state virology
laboratory.

After enduring their ordeal, both individuals said they had difficulty
getting answers on how to report and get a response to such an
incident. And through the 1st-hand experience of being bitten, the
woman has also learned about how expensive it is to confirm and treat
a case of rabies.

The gentleman knew things were not quite right when he heard a rumble
by his trash cans around 10 p.m. on Sunday [28 Nov 2010]. "I looked
out at what I thought was a raccoon," he said. The veteran hunter
noticed that there was trash strewn about his driveway and went to
pick it up. Suddenly the creature came running toward him then slid
beneath his car.

"I had seen him coming, and the only thing I could grab was a smoker
lid made out of light sheet metal that I use for grilling. No sooner
had I got the lid in my hands, he bolts out from under the car and
goes after me. I clocked him a couple of times," said the man, who
then realized he was being attacked by a fox. After a brief game of
cat-and-mouse, the animal walked away.

About 8 hours later, the fox returned.

It was about 5:30 a.m. on Monday [29 Nov 2010]. The woman had just
taken her dog out and went back outside to grab a recycling bin. "I
saw this gray thing low to the ground. I thought it was a stray cat,
so I went to shoo it away. Next thing I knew, it was on my leg," she
said. "I saw it was a fox. No matter how many times I kicked at it,
it kept coming back."

The gentleman (mentioned previously), who was getting ready to go
hunting, heard his neighbor scream and ran outside. Over the course of
about 20 minutes, he and the woman's sister worked to extricate the
woman from the fox's jaws. The man, using the same smoker lid,
eventually struck the animal out cold then choked it. Though the fox
was dead, the ordeal was far from over.

The woman's sister had called city police, who responded with
paramedics. The police suggested the residents call the animal control
officer about testing the fox for rabies and disposing of it.

Though she said the medics told her she didn't have to go to the
hospital, the woman, looking through her shredded jeans, found that
the animal had bitten through to her skin. So she had relatives drive
her to the emergency room at Berkshire Medical Center. [This is almost
unthinkable. If the medics knew the animal had attacked the
individuals and there was a bite involved, it is difficult to
understand why they did not insist on the victim seeking medical
treatment. - Mod.TG]

On Monday she began the lengthy series of anti-rabies vaccinations,
which included injections into each bite mark. She returned to the
hospital for another shot on Thursday [2 Dec 2010] and learned that
she has 10 more vaccinations to endure this month, with each hospital
visit at a USD 75 co-pay.

The involved individuals began looking into testing and disposing of
the animal.

According to information compiled by the state Office of Health and
Human Services, the state Department of Public Health's Division of
Epidemiology and Immunization should be contacted for advice on human
exposure to a suspected rabid animal. Domestic animal exposure should
be reported to a local animal control officer or the state Division of
Agricultural Resources, Bureau of Animal Health and Dairy Services.

Questions about wild animal or ferret exposures should be directed to
the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife (MDFW). Catherine
Williams, a spokeswoman for the state Division of Wildlife and
Fisheries (MDFW) told The Eagle that environmental police officers can
be a resource, as they are trained to respond quickly to any wildlife
emergency be it a rabid animal or road kill.

But after talking to local representatives from the MDFW and the city
animal control department, neither involved individual said they were
directed to the environmental police.

"I called animal shelters and they couldn't help. I called a rabies
hotline and nobody picked up," said one of them. The fox's body sat on
the woman's property for 3 days until they learned that the animal
could be brought to a local veterinary hospital to be prepped, secured
and shipped to a state laboratory to be tested for rabies.

The woman elected to do this, but learned that it had to be on her own
dime. "I paid USD 195 -- but I wanted to know. Some of the neighbors
have kids who wait outside for the school bus in the morning. I want
people to know and to be careful. This didn't happen in the woods but
my own yard. I would hate for someone else to be attacked," she said.

Andrew Madden, the Western District supervisor for the MDFW said it is
not unusual to see both red and gray foxes in Berkshire County and
especially Pittsfield. He said that people should not approach or feed
wild animals, and should secure their trash so that animals won't be
attracted to it.

"Foxes can be active at all different times of day. But they're
usually pretty shy creatures that easily scare away," said Madden. He
said that the case of the fox attack on Bel Air Avenue is "a rare
occurrence."

[This article should surely be a public relations nightmare for the
town. No one seems to know about rabies, not even the medic. Then the
affected individuals are not told to seek medical attention. The
animal's body remained on the property for 3 days. I hope it was cold
or the brain would have been mush and likely the best rabies in the
lab would not have been able to test a head full of neural soup. I am
aghast that the affected individual had to pay for the test. Most
health departments have a zoonotic department that has a budget for
it. - Mod.TG]

Man goes through rabies treatment after large cat attack
--------------------------------------------------------
A Marshall County man is recovering after what he describes as a big
cat attack earlier in the week. The victim lives in the rural part of
the county and says it wasn't a bobcat but something bigger that
attacked him. Some of his neighbors backed up his claim. The victim
says he was taking a stray dog through the woods to a neighbor's home
near Union Grove when he came in contact with a big cat.

"It was a Florida panther. The tan ones that have the white spots
around the whiskers," he said.

He says that's when the animal attacked him. He says the cat ripped
through his coveralls, some underclothing, and did damage to his leg.
He fought back with a knife and stabbed it. When the victim got back
home, his mother said she urged him to seek medical attention. Because
he believes the animal was sickly, he plans to go through the rabies
treatments.

Neighbors also backed up his claim of big cats in the area. Another
resident claims he saw a tan cougar on his back porch a year ago.

[5] Raccoon, canine, human exposure - Maine

<http://naturalunseenhazards.wordpress.com/2010/12/06/rabies-reports-from-alabama-maine-new-jersey-2-pennsylvania-texas-and-virginia/>

There has been a resurgence of rabies cases in raccoons in southern
Maine in recent years, and state health officials say they continue to
see the disease circulate. Most of us know to keep our distance from
wild animals, but what if they come after you in your own yard? It's
happened again, this time in Gorham.

The victim saw a big raccoon come running up his driveway after his
Maltese Poodle. The raccoon latched on to the dog's side and wouldn't
let go until the victim hit it repeatedly with a bottle. But the
raccoon didn't stop there. A few hours later it attacked a man
delivering lumber to the victim's house. That [delivery] man killed
the animal with a pipe. Its remains have been sent to Augusta to
determine if the raccoon was indeed rabid.

Dr. Dora Mills with the Centers for Disease Control says everyone
should have their pets vaccinated and keep those shots up to date. The
dog's were. He's in quarantine and on antibiotics, but the vet says
he'll be fine. Mills also says stay away from wildlife, including
squirrels, which can also be rabid. And if you get bitten, see a
doctor immediately.

Raccoon tests positive -- but park critics are rabid
----------------------------------------------------
A Prospect Park raccoon has tested positive for rabies -- and park
advocates are slamming city and park officials for being part of the
problem. On 2 Dec 2010, the raccoon was discovered to be carrying the
viral disease rabies, which causes death in humans if left untreated.
But city officials didn't reveal the information to the public -- and
haven't even been testing the dozens of animals that have turned up
dead in the park during a spate of bizarre critter deaths.

Instead, animal corpses have been dumped with the trash rather than
dispatched to the Department of Health for proper testing. "People
need to know," said Anne-Katrin Titze, a state-certified wildlife
rehabilitator. "There is already an outbreak of raccoon rabies in
Central Park -- and it's clearly moving."

In Central Park, more than 120 raccoons have tested positive for
rabies, city data reveal. To combat rabies there, the city began a
widely publicized raccoon vaccination program. "But the city hasn't
publicized the Brooklyn issue, and people don't know," Titze said.

The Health Department did not issue a press release on the case. At
press time, the agency did not say how many dead animals found in
Prospect Park it has tested for rabies. Those familiar with the case
said the raccoon was discovered near the just-renovated Vanderbilt
Playground in the southwest section of the park.

Park officials insisted staff are following the correct protocol. "It
is standard that if a dead animal is in the park and not severely
decomposed, the rangers are supposed to take them to the Health
Department," said Eugene Patron, a spokesman for the Prospect Park
Alliance.

But that's not enough, said park advocates, who have long complained
of slow clean-ups and large piles of garbage after summer weekends.

"The problem with the park is also a lack of cleanup. When there's
more food, there is more offspring -- and more raccoons means more of
a potential to get infected," said Ed Bahlman.

Health officials vowed to conduct enhanced rabies surveillance in
Prospect and Fort Greene parks, the latter where a rabid raccoon was
discovered in February 2010, the 1st raccoon with rabies found in
Brooklyn since the disease arrived in the city in 1992.

"These results will help determine if the rabid raccoon cases found in
these parks are isolated incidents or may represent the larger
transmission of raccoon rabies in Brooklyn," an agency spokeswoman
said. People and unvaccinated animals can acquire rabies, typically
from a bite by an infected animal, leading to a severe brain disease
that causes death unless swift medical treatment is administered.
There hasn't been a human case of rabies reported in the city since
1953.

[ProMED-mail had 2 posts in 2009 [20091208.4186 and 20091207.4172]
regarding rabies in Central Park. This piece confirms that the rabies
issue in the city parks has not gone away and may have gotten worse.

While slow park clean up may be part of the problem, citizens
attending functions in the park should participate in park clean up by
placing all unwanted items in appropriate garage receptacles. Food
items are attractants to most animals. Placing all unwanted food,
trash and other debris in garage receptacles would help facilitate
park clean up in a timely fashion and reduce the temptation to wild
animals.

New York City has been conducting rabies vaccinations, on an
apparently catch and release technique, which is perhaps a slow way of
vaccination in such large areas. While oral rabies baits may be
quicker, the officials may have worried about domestic animals or
children getting uneaten baits. - Mod.TG]

Dead raccoon in Orange had rabies
---------------------------------
A raccoon picked up by a dog off of St. Mary's Road in Hillsborough,
North Carolina, last week had rabies, county officials reported
Tuesday [7 Dec 2010]. It was the 9th reported case this year in Orange
County.

The case began 1 Dec 2010 when a resident saw her dog come to the door
with a dead raccoon in its mouth. The dog then hid the raccoon in the
leaves. The owner found it the next morning and Animal Control removed
it for testing.

In a separate case Thursday [2 Dec 2010] in the same general area,
another resident found a dead skunk in his dog pen. Because the skunk
was already decomposing, it could not be tested for rabies.

In both cases, the 4 dogs involved were all vaccinated against rabies
and were to get booster shots. Under state law, if there is "a
reasonable suspicion of exposure," a dog or cat with a current
vaccination must receive a booster shot within 5 days. An unvaccinated
animal must be destroyed or quarantined for 6 months.

The 2nd case of rabies in New Hanover County this week has been
confirmed, officials said Tuesday [7 Dec 2010].

County animal control officers were called 4 Dec 2010 to a residence
on Horne Place Drive where the owner of 2 pet dogs there suspected the
dogs had come into contact with a wild raccoon. The raccoon died soon
after the report was taken, and tests at a state lab confirmed it had
the rabies virus, according to a press release from the county.

The 2 dogs were current on their rabies vaccines and received booster
vaccinations, though the dogs' owners were told about possible
exposure because they might have come into contact with the diseased
animal, the release stated.

This was the 11th case of confirmed rabies in the county this year.

Officials confirm 3rd rabies case this week
-------------------------------------------
New Hanover County animal control officials on Thursday [9 Dec 2010]
reported the 3rd confirmed case of rabies this week. The rabid raccoon
discovered Tuesday [7 Dec 2010] was the 12th case in the county for
the year.

A resident on Greenville Loop Road reported that one of his 3 dogs had
attacked and injured a raccoon, according to a press release from the
county. The man then kenneled the dog with his 2 other dogs, the news
release stated. None of the dogs were current on their rabies
vaccination, which means they will have to be put down or quarantined
for several months.

People who handled the dogs and raccoon were notified of possible
exposure to the rabies virus. Officials said people should wear gloves
while handling pets that were exposed to wildlife that can carry
rabies such as raccoons, foxes, skunks and bats, to prevent
transmission of the virus.

<http://www.tcpalm.com/news/2010/dec/03/rabies-alert-issued-for-area-of-south-indian/>


The Health Department issued a rabies alert Friday [3 Dec 2010] after
a rabid stray cat bit a resident who was feeding the animal last week.

On 22 Nov 2010, the man was feeding the cat when the animal bit him.
The cat appeared to be ill when it was taken to the Indian River
County Humane Society, and 2 days later it died, said Cheryl Dunn,
county health department environmental manager.

The animal was sent out to be tested for rabies. When results came
back positive, the man was referred to resources for preventative
treatment, Dunn said. Rabies spreads through saliva and usually is
passed animal-to-animal or animal-to-person by a bite. Though the
virus is preventable, there's no cure.

"As the weather gets colder, and food tends to dry up, people tend to
feed stray animals," Dunn said. "They shouldn't be feeding strange,
wild animals they don't know." Residents should steer clear of stray
cats, skunks, raccoons or bats that are acting disoriented or
attacking pets and report them to Indian River County Animal Control
or the Vero Beach Police Department, a health department release said.

3 raccoon attacks in May 2010 also prompted a rabies alert, which
expired in August 2010.
