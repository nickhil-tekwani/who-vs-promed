Update on cases of Legionnaires' disease
----------------------------------------
The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today [Mon 3 Oct 2022] reported the latest number of cases of Legionnaires' disease (LD), and stressed the importance of using and maintaining properly designed man-made water systems, adding that susceptible groups should strictly observe relevant precautions.

From [25 Sep 2022] to [1 Oct 2022], 2 community-acquired LD cases were reported:
1. A female patient, aged 98 with underlying illnesses, who lives in Yau Yat Tsuen, Magnolia Road, Sham Shui Po; and
2. A male patient, aged 67 with underlying illnesses, who lives in Chung Mei Lo Uk Village, Tsing Yi.

"Epidemiological investigations are ongoing to identify potential sources of infection, high-risk exposure and clusters, if any," a spokesman for the CHP said.

As of [1 Oct 2022], 65 LD cases had been reported this year [2022]. In 2021 and 2020, there were 69 and 104 cases respectively.

"Men, people aged over 50, smokers, alcoholics and persons with weakened immunity are more susceptible to LD. Some situations may also increase the risk of infection, including poor maintenance of water systems leading to stagnant water; living in areas with old water systems, cooling towers or fountains; using electric water heaters, whirlpools and spas or hot water spring spas; and recent stays in hotels or vessels," the spokesman said.

Legionellae are found in various environmental settings and grow well in warm water (20 to 45 deg. C, or 68 to 113 deg. F). They can be found in aqueous environments such as water tanks, hot and cold water systems, cooling towers, whirlpools and spas, water fountains and home apparatus that support breathing. People may become infected when they breathe in contaminated droplets (aerosols) and mist generated by artificial water systems, or when handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes.

Immunocompromised persons should:
- Use sterile or boiled water for drinking, tooth brushing and mouth rinsing;
- Avoid using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices. A shower may also generate small aerosols; and
- If using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices, fill the water tank with only sterile or cooled freshly boiled water, and not water directly from the tap. Also, clean and maintain humidifiers/devices regularly according to manufacturers' instructions. Never leave stagnant water in a humidifier/device. Empty the water tank, wipe all surfaces dry, and change the water daily.

The public should observe the health advice below:
- Observe personal hygiene;
- Do not smoke and avoid alcohol consumption;
- Strainers in water taps and shower heads should be inspected, cleaned, descaled and disinfected regularly or at a frequency recommended by the manufacturer;
- If a fresh-water plumbing system is properly maintained, it is not necessary to install domestic water filters. Use of water filters is not encouraged as clogging occurs easily, which can promote growth of micro-organisms. In case water filters are used, the pore size should be 0.2 micrometres (µm) and the filter needs to be changed periodically according to the manufacturer's recommendations;
- Drain and clean water tanks of buildings at least quarterly;
- Drain or purge for at least one minute infrequently used water outlets (e.g. water taps, shower heads and hot water outlets) and stagnant points of the pipework weekly or before use;
- Seek and follow doctors' professional advice regarding the use and maintenance of home respiratory devices and use only sterile water (not distilled or tap water) to clean and fill the reservoir. Clean and maintain the device regularly according to the manufacturer's instructions. After cleaning/disinfection, rinse the device with sterile water, cooled freshly boiled water or water filtered with 0.2 µm filters. Never leave stagnant water in the device. - Empty the water tank, keep all surfaces dry, and change the water daily; and
- When handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes:
1. Wear gloves and a face mask;
2. Water gardens and compost gently using low pressure;
3. Open composted potting mixes slowly and make sure the opening is directed away from the face;
4. Wet the soil to reduce dust when potting plants; and
5. Avoid working in poorly ventilated places such as enclosed greenhouses.

The public may visit the CHP's LD page https://www.chp.gov.hk/en/features/24307.html, the Code of Practice for Prevention of LD and the Housekeeping Guidelines for Cold and Hot Water Systems for Building Management https://www.emsd.gov.hk/en/supporting_government_initiatives/legionnaires_disease/publications/codes_of_practice/index.html of the Prevention of LD Committee, and the CHP's risk-based strategy https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201512/30/P201512300247.htm for prevention and control of LD.

[The Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection report above does not tell of any epidemiologic or microbiologic linkage for the 2 cases of legionnaires' disease reported above. The 2 cases live about 11 km [approx. 7 mi] apart (see map for locations of these 2 cases at https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Chung+Mei+Lo+Uk+Village,+Tsing+Yi,+Hong+Kong/Magnolia+Rd,+Yau+Yat+Chuen,+Hong+Kong.)

For discussions of Legionnaires' disease, please see my moderator's comments in prior ProMED posts: Legionellosis - USA (02): (CA) fatal, RFI 20220313.8701956; Legionellosis - USA (03): (HI) hotel 20220328.8702268; and Legionellosis - Australia: (NS) 20220527.8703505.

We are not told if genotyping of clinical or environmental (water) isolates has been done. Genotyping the clinical isolates from the cases of Legionnaires' disease will help confirm if this is a common source outbreak if the genotypes happen to match. Matching the genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_ will identify the environmental source for the individual cases. However, if the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping.

More information on this cluster of cases of legionellosis, if available, would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
