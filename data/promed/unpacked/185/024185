COCCIDIOMYCOSIS, ZEBRAS (2)
============================
Dave,
we've encountered several affected Przewalski horses with
coccidioidomycosis. The San Diego Wild Animal Park has had all of the
cases within the society. Dr. Jeff Zuba (102521.2613@compuserve.com)
has dealt with some of these cases before. I'm forwarding a copy of
your message along with my response to Jeff to let him know you are
interested in more information. Good luck with your cases.
