Domoic acid outbreak leads to sea lion deaths on Ventura County's coast
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of domoic acid poisoning, along with fewer fish because of El
Nino weather conditions, is leading to a high number of sea lions ending up
sick or dead on Ventura County [in California, United States] beaches.
Though it is happening up and down the Central Coast, Ventura County has
the most, 15 [dead sea lions] in the past 2 weeks.

"It could be the start of something big, or it could be a small event,"
said Joe Cordaro, marine mammal stranding coordinator with the National
Marine Fisheries Service. "We should get used to seeing both live and dead
animals for awhile."

Domoic acid is a naturally occurring toxin in the algae, which fish eat.
When the sea lions eat the fish, they become sick, suffer from seizures and
brain damage and can die.

Cordaro said the end of an El Nino season, which warms the waters and makes
fewer fish available for the sea lions, is also a factor. "It used to be
that we could anticipate domoic outbreaks in March, April and May, but we
have had them crop up in summer and fall," he said. It is unknown what
causes the acid.

Ruth Dover, who helps run the Channel Islands Marine and Wildlife
Institute, said most of the sea lions it has picked up have been females,
some of them pregnant. Most of the animals they pick up die before they can
be released, she said.

Cordaro said that in California, where there are about 300 000 sea lions,
the annual domoic deaths do not affect the health of the population.

If anyone sees a sick sea lion, he or she is advised to leave it alone and
call the Channel Islands Marine and Wildlife Institute.

[Domoic acid, an acidic cyanotoxin, a neurotoxic tricarboxylic amino acid
structurally related to kainic and glutamic acids, associated with certain
algal blooms and possibly produced by the diatom Pseudo-nitzschia is also
called amnesic shellfish poison (ASP). Domoic acid was named for the
seaweed from which it was discovered, _Chondria armata_, called domoi in
Japan. The toxic acid is accumulated by marine organisms (including sea
lions) feeding on phytoplankton, anchovies, sardines, and shellfish. Domoic
acid is essentially a neurotoxin in mammals causing brain damage,
neurological dysfunction, and death in severe cases.

In 1987, several people died and more than 100 became ill after eating blue
mussels caught off Prince Edward Island, Canada. It was determined by
Canadian scientists that domoic acid had entered the food chain when the
mussels fed on a toxic algae bloom of the pennate diatom Pseudonitzschia
pungens forma multiseries.

In 1991, in Monterey Bay, California, a bloom of _Pseudo-nitzschia
australis_ also produced domoic acid that was then concentrated in
anchovies feeding upon it. The deaths of pelicans and cormorants that ate
the anchovies were reported to be related to their exposure to domoic acid.

Transient elevations of plasma BUN levels, as well as neurodegeneration of
the hippocampus, and memory deficits have been associated with near-lethal
domoic acid exposures.
