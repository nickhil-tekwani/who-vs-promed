Outbreak of typhoid reported in Karainagar
-------------------------------------------
An outbreak of typhoid fever has been reported from Karainagar in Jaffna
district. About 300 residents have been affected with the fever,
medical sources in Karainagar said.
The cause for the outbreak of the disease is due to nonavailability of pure
drinking water in the village. Karainagar is currently experiencing severe
drought, civil sources said.
Thamileelam Health and Medical Service (THMS) has launched an awareness
campaign in Karainagar to arrest the spread of the disease.
Mr. Arun, head of the THMS, said that they have made arrangements to
provide emergency treatment to affected persons and also to contain the
spread of the disease.

[Jaffna is located on a peninsula in northern Sri Lanka. The peninsula,
home to more than 1 million people, and the rest of the Northern province
are the country's driest areas.
Typhoid continues to be a significant water-borne pathogen in much of the
world where potable water is rarely, if ever, available. - Mod.LL]
