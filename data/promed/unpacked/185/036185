- Brazil: Next Epicenter?
Date: 2 Jul 2020

Latin America became the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic in late May 2020, largely driven by Brazil's ballooning caseload, as the number of infections in the United States and Europe fell.

In recent weeks, Brazil has reported upward of 1000 new deaths a day from Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, eclipsing the death toll in every country other than the United States. On 19 Jun 2020, the country reported 54 771 new cases, the largest one-day total for any country hit by the pandemic. If the trend lines hold, some epidemiologists project the death toll of the epidemic in Brazil could surpass that in the United States by late July 2020.

Even as the country's coronavirus crisis worsened in recent weeks, some major cities eased preventive measures in mid-June 2020. Shopping malls have begun to reopen in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Beaches are starting to draw crowds again, even as some hospital systems are close to running out of intensive care beds.

Brazil declared a public health emergency in early March 2020, just a few days after the World Health Organization did. The Ministry of Health urged state officials to cancel public events and put social-distancing measures in place.

Some experts thought Brazil was well equipped to rise to the challenge, based on its track record during past public health emergencies. Brazil had months to study the responses of the 1st countries hit by the virus, and it has a public health care system that, while underfunded, provides robust coverage across the country.

The conflicting messages from the government, experts say, left Brazilians uncertain about the merits of isolation measures, which led to low compliance. That in turn led to Brazil's contagion rate being one of the highest in the world.

Brazil has struggled to import essential and lifesaving equipment, like coronavirus tests and ventilators. The lack of tests has made it difficult for officials to understand in real time where and how fast the virus is spreading. Experts believe Brazil's official coronavirus figures significantly undercount the scope of the problem.

Between 1 Jan - 6 Jun 2020, 23 171 people who were not diagnosed with the coronavirus died from acute respiratory infections, according to data released by Fiocruz, one of Brazil's state-run health research institutes. Experts believe most of them died from Covid-19.

Hospital systems have largely coped with the crush of patients, but the virus has taken a devastating toll on health care workers. Dozens of nurses and hospital technicians have died after contracting the virus at work.

Poor Brazilians who get sick are less likely to receive high quality health care. Although most public hospitals are operating near full capacity, several private hospitals have plenty of room to spare. The death rate in poorer cities has been substantially higher than the rate in rich ones.

There are some signs that the outbreak in Brazil is starting to stabilize. A study by the Imperial College London estimated that Brazil's contagion rate reached 1.05 this week, down from 2.8 in April 2020. The current rate means every 100 people who are contaminated infect another 105. The outbreak is considered to be under control when the contagion rate is below 1.

"The rise is not as exponential as it was previously," Michael Ryan, the World Health Organization's executive director, told reporters, but the disease can take off again."

[ProMED thanks Prof Bercovier for transmitting this very interesting and timely large-scale study of the situation in Brazil, together with the following comments: "A very different picture of what is seen in Europe. Very few asymptomatic, the poor are always the highest victims, the tropical regions are more affected than the colder south and the children 0-4 are with the highest prevalence of antibodies and consequently the most infected. Their conclusion: the number of real Covid-19 cases is 6 times higher than the number of diagnosed cases." Please see the original URL PDF for very clear color-coded graphical data. -Mod.LXL]

[2] Australia: Rise in Cases
Date: 4 Jul 2020
Source: Reuters [edited]
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-australia/australias-victoria-reports-108-new-coronavirus-cases-biggest-jump-since-march-idUSKCN24508A


Australia's 2nd most-populous state, Victoria, reported its largest jump in coronavirus cases since late March 2020 on Saturday [4 Jul 2020], forcing the expansion of stay-at-home orders to more Melbourne suburbs and the complete lockdown of 9 public housing towers.

The southeastern state recorded 108 new cases on Saturday [4 Jul 2020], up from 66 on Fri 3 Jul 2020 and more than 70 new cases in each of the previous 4 days.

"These numbers are a very real concern to all of us," Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews told a news conference.

The spike in Victoria is being closely watched as the rest of the country has reined in the virus that causes COVID-19.

Australia's most populated state, New South Wales, reported 6 new coronavirus cases on Saturday [4 Jul 2020], 5 of them returning travellers from overseas.

Overall, Australia has weathered the coronavirus pandemic much better than most other nations, with just over 8300 cases and 104 deaths so far.

The 9 towers in Melbourne consist of 1345 units, housing about 3000 residents. They will be locked down for at least 5 days, effective immediately, after many residents from those towers returned a positive COVID-19 test.

Police will be placed on each floor of the towers, and law enforcement authorities will also control access points.

"These are very challenging times," Premier Andrews added. "The alternative is that this gets right away from us, and we have not just 12 postcodes in lockdown but every postcode locked down. I don't want to get to that."

[The number of cases has risen slowly in Australia since the 1st case was reported on 15 Feb 2020. Imposing restrictions in identified hotspots is an essential feature to check COVID-19 transmission, but this has to be coupled with robust testing to confirm and isolate cases and to identify contacts and implement quarantine measures.

[The outbreak in Beijing continues with 2 newly confirmed cases attributed to the outbreak. The 1st case in Beijing was reported on 11 Jun 2020; as of 3 Jul 2020, there have been 335 cases reported from Beijing, 21 in Hebei, and 3 in Liaoning, most likely associated with this outbreak.

There were 7 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic individuals and one new conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours.

Hong Kong reported 11 new cases https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202007/04/P2020070400804.htm.

Takeaway message: China continues to have importations of infected individuals with the SARS-CoV-2; many of whom are detected as asymptomatic at the time of positive PCR testing. Cases are still being confirmed in Beijing.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA as per Worldometer data for the top 20 reporting entities.

In the past 24 hours, the proportion of newly confirmed cases was 2.0%. The 7-day average of newly confirmed cases for the past 7 days is 38.0% higher than the 7-day average for the preceding 7 days, consistent with the ongoing pandemic in the country picking up momentum.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html has data on cases, hospitalization, testing, and epidemiologic variables such as age, race, ILI (influenza-like illness), surveillance, and emergency room visits, which are definitely worth reviewing as a welcome series of analyses. According to CDC data, the percentage of laboratory specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 with a molecular assay is 9% positive out of 36 255 888 tests performed, consistent with the ongoing, as yet not under control pandemic in the country (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html).

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update (please note that there has been a consistent weekend reporting artifact since the presentation of these data began):
----------------------------------
The Americas region reported 61.1% of the global newly reported cases and 66.1% of newly reported deaths for this 24-hour period. The USA reported 41.0% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, and Brazil reported 37.1%, Mexico 5.2%, Colombia 3.2%, Peru and Chile at 2.7% each, and Argentina 2.1%. The same 5 countries remained at the top; the USA and Brazil are usually numbers 1 and 2; while they vary for which of the 2 positions they hold, this week the USA has dominated with the proportion represented by Brazil decreasing. Other countries are continuing to increase their proportional representation within the region such as Mexico, Colombia, Peru, and periodically Chile, Ecuador, and Argentina.

The European region reported 9.3% of the global newly reported cases and 11.0% of the newly confirmed deaths in the region. Russia reported 33.6% of the regional newly confirmed cases, followed by Kazakhstan 8.3%, Turkey 5.9%, Israel 5.7%, Ukraine 4.6%, Sweden 3.9%, Armenia 2.9%, the UK 2.6%, France and Spain at 2.3%, Romania and Germany at 2.1% each. The proportion of cases represented by Russia continues to decrease. Armenia, Azerbaijan, Israel, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Ukraine are prominent in countries noted to have resurgence in Europe.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 9.3% of the global newly reported cases and 9.6% of global newly reported fatalities. Saudi Arabia reported 20.9% of the regional newly reported cases followed by Pakistan at 16.8%, Iran 12.8%, Iraq 11.5%, Qatar 8.3 %, Egypt 7.0%, Oman 6.8%, and Kuwait 4.1%. Multiple countries are very active in the region, the same countries with some changes in the order since yesterday (3 Jul 2020). Qatar moved to number 5 in daily case numbers.

The African region reported 5.9% of the global newly reported cases and 2.7% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 71.8% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Ghana 6.0%, Nigeria 3.6%, Algeria 3.3%, Cote d'Ivoire 2.2%, and Kenya 1.9. South Africa and Nigeria are usually numbers 1 and 2 [Ghana is number 2 in the last 24 hours], and other countries have less consistent reporting patterns and vary considerably from day to day. Of note is that South Africa is now reporting over 8000 cases in a day.

The Western Pacific region reported 1.1% of the global newly reported cases and 0.15% of global deaths. The Philippines reported 68.0% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Australia 11.2%, Japan 9.5%, Singapore 7.5%, South Korea 2.7%, and China 0.40%. The Philippines is consistently reporting the highest number of cases while today [4 Jul 2020], Australia surpassed Japan for the number 2 slot. Other countries, including South Korea, Malaysia, and Australia, vary in daily reporting.

The South East Asia region reported 13.2% of the global newly reported cases and 10.4% of global deaths. India reported 81.5% of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 11.1%, Indonesia 4.6%, and Nepal 2.6%, the same countries, same order as in previous days, with India continuing to be the driving force in the regional growth in cases.

Impression: The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed cases on a daily basis, followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean alternating on a daily basis of their order, followed by the Africa region and the Western Pacific representing the lowest daily case load of all of the regions. The Africa region is slowing increasing their representation in terms of increased case reporting.

Figure 2. The epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 4 Jul 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent visual representation of the epidemic as described in the above text. The Americas region continues to increase, as does South-East Asia, in terms of daily newly confirmed cases; the African region is noticeably increasing as well. The Americas region continues to greatly outnumber all other regions for daily reporting.

The WHO Timeline of WHO's response to COVID-19 [last updated 30 Jun 2020] has also acknowledged ProMED's earliest alert generated on the undiagnosed confirmed pneumonia cases: "WHO's Epidemic Intelligence from Open Sources (EIOS) platform also picked up a media report on ProMED (a program of the International Society for Infectious Diseases) about the same cluster of cases of "pneumonia of unknown cause" in Wuhan" on 31 Dec 2019. - Mod.UBA]

[This data presentation has been shortened and includes only the top 25 countries. For those who wish to see the detailed global data, a snapshot of the Worldometer table at the time we accessed it is available at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/JULY4DATASET_1593948748.pdf.]

A 7-day series of cumulative reported cases by countries, territories, and reporting entities can be found at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/JULY4WORLD7_1593948687.pdf. - Mod.UBA]

[On 2 Jul 2020, the Worldometer (and the Johns Hopkins CSSE data) showed a decrease in 29 726 cases for the UK. From https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/about: "Pillar 2 data for England has had duplicate tests for the same person removed by PHE from 2 Jul 2020. This means that the cumulative total number of UK lab-confirmed cases is now around 30 000 lower than reported on 1 Jul 2020." - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]

On 2 Jun 2020, France completed a review of all positive lab tests reported and removed all duplicate tests on individuals who were counted more than once. This led to a decrease in cumulative case counts.

[In the table above, NA is "not applicable;" those countries whose 1st case was reported after 1 Mar 2020 did not have cases on 1 Mar 2020. - Mod.UBA]

[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of reported cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 11 190 678, with reports of cases by 217 countries and territories worldwide. The total case numbers crossed the 11 million mark in the last 24 hours. The global case count rose by 1.6% in the past 24 hours. The USA, with more than 2.91 million confirmed cases, now represents 25.6% of the global cases of COVID-19, and Brazil with more than 1.54 million cases represents 13.7% of the global cases of COVID-19. Other countries such as Chile, Peru, Mexico, India, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Pakistan are reporting increased numbers of new and cumulative cases as well. If one tallies the total cumulative case counts for the top 5 countries (USA, Brazil, Russia, India, and Spain), they represent over half of the total cases reported globally (53.9%). A global total of 533 388 deaths have been reported, an increase of 5077 deaths in the past 24 hours.

A reminder that in the absence of well-developed contact-tracing activities with testing of asymptomatic and mildly ill contacts, numbers of SARS-CoV-2 virus infections are significantly underreported: actual numbers may be 10-20 times larger. There are also individuals who stay at home throughout their illness, sometimes, unfortunately, dying at home, who are never officially confirmed as infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These data are presented to provide relative indicators of the situations in each of the countries and comparisons between countries and regions of the world.

In descending rank order, the USA is number 1 for cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19, followed by Brazil, Russia, India, Spain, Peru, Chile, the UK, Mexico, and Italy at number 10. China remains at number 22. In descending rank order, the USA is number 1 for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by India, Brazil, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Iran. Kazakhstan has been replaced on the top 10 and is now number 17 on this list, reflecting continued increase in transmission in the country. All countries that are currently experiencing major community-based transmission and considered global hot spots. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed cases went from 2449 to 24 969.

The top 20 countries in terms of cumulative cases include 7 from the European region, 7 from the Americas region, 3 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 from the South-East Asia region, and 1 from the African region unchanged for the past 3 days. There are no countries from the Western Pacific region. The top 20 countries in terms of numbers of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours include 8 from the Americas region, 6 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 3 from the South East Asia region, 2 from the European region, 1 from the African region (an increase of 1 in the Americas region and a dropping off of the 1 in the Western Pacific region). This listing very much reflects the "hot spots" in terms of countries and regions with ongoing high transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Impression: The SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts. - Mod.UBA]
