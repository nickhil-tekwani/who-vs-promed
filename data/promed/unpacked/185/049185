Even as 13 persons, mostly minors, fell prey to mystery fever in
Ramabainagar district ([formerly] Kanpur Dehat) on Monday [4 Oct
2010], district officials claimed they were trying to contain the
spread of the disease which has claimed 180 lives so far. "As many as
14 medical teams and paramedical teams are working in the field. The
situation is being monitored in all the 82 affected villages,''
district magistrate Saroj Tewari told TOI. Children are especially
vulnerable to the killer virus, which was evident with 7 deaths of
minors in the district on Monday itself.

The DM [district magistrate] has ordered health authorities to launch
a massive cleanliness drive in all the villages. "Health teams have
been asked to spray insecticide in the affected areas and distribute
medicines to those down with fever,'' he added.

A resident of Akbarpur, said the deaths have created a scare among
the residents of Ramabainagar district. A public campaign has also
been launched and villagers are being asked to report any symptoms of
the disease as soon as possible. Health officials say the earlier it
is detected, the easier it is to cure. Chief medical officer,
Lajjaram said, "We are taking effective steps to curb the disease.''

The health authorities, who till now had been terming these patients
as suspected dengue, malaria, encephalitis, viral fever cases, said
that the campaign to investigate, control, and prevent spread of this
fever were being continuing. Of the 1172 persons who visited the
district hospital on Monday [4 Oct 2010], 207 were running fever. We
have started the treatment of 21 patients here,'' Akbarpur district
hospital authorities told TOI.

The continuous increase in the number of fever cases being reported
everyday is causing concern for the health authorities, more so
because the mystery fever seems to have spread to some more villages
of the district. In fact, the district health authorities are
consulting specialists at the state capital to ascertain the disease.

Meanwhile, medical experts said that the stagnant water after rains
in the region have only aggravated the problem, as mosquitoes would
get more breeding grounds. Though fogging operations have been
undertaken in the entire district particularly in Malasa, Amraudha,
and Akbarpur from where maximum number of patients have come, this
has not helped in stopping the fever from spreading.

[The region where the cases are occurring is in mid-Uttar Pradesh,
and not in the eastern region of the state where the cases of
Japanese encephalitis and undiagnosed encephalitis cases have been
occurring recently. The distance between these 2 areas does not
exclude the possibility of JE virus infections in the outbreak above.
However, this report does not provide enough information to even
speculate on what the etiological agent involved in this outbreak
might be. The health authorities are apparently categorizing these
patients as suspected dengue, malaria, encephalitis, and viral fever
cases -- all caused by very different etiological agents. Viral fever
and encephalitis are general diagnoses and could be caused by several
different viruses, if indeed viruses are involved. The emphasis on
mosquito control implies vector transmission. The authorities are not
quoted as indicating which of these etiological agents have been
tested for nor on what basis mosquito transmission is suspected.

It is difficult to understand how health officials can state that "we
are taking effective steps to curb the disease,'' if they do not know
which etiological agent(s) is (are) causing the cases. It would be of
interest to know if Nipah virus infections have been tested for.
Nipah virus is endemic in _Pteropus_ fruit bats in the Indian
subcontinent and Southeast Asia, and transmission does not involve
arthropod vectors. The 7 Oct 2010 edition of the Press Trust of India
(<http://ptinews.com/news/965007_11-die-due-to-viral--malaria-and-dengue-fever-in-Kanpur>)
quoted local health authorities as saying that they do not have
adequate facilities to detect dengue cases and have to send the
samples to Lucknow, 150 km (93 mi) from Kampur. The test report takes
at least 3-4 days to come. ProMED-mail hopes that the test result for
dengue and other potential etiological agents will become available
soon and permit local health authorities to focus on appropriate
preventive measures. ProMED will be very interested in receiving
further information as it becomes available.
