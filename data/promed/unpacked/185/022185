[1] Cholera - Zambia (Copperbelt)

Copperbelt Permanent Secretary Ville Lombanya says the province has
recorded more than 70 cases of cholera from Chililabombwe and Kitwe
districts in 2010. The PS said cholera has remained one of the
world's most under reported and neglected diseases which occur in
areas where access to safe water and sanitation is limited. Mr.
Lombanya said this in Kitwe at the Edinburgh hotel during the
provincial epidemics preparedness meeting. He said efficient cholera
control measures need to be put in place at the national and sub
region levels to prevent epidemics.

Chililabombwe district health director Dr. Kioso Mudimbiyi said the
district had recorded 2 deaths out of the 36 cases of cholera that
were confirmed.

Dr. Mudimbiyi in his presentation to the meeting said that
contaminated water as a result of vandalized water pipes and shallow
wells coupled with uncollected garbage have been identified to be a
source of the outbreak. He added that the district's technical
committee has intensified its monitoring of water quality in the district.

[2] Cholera - Benin (Atlantique)

In Benin, cholera has killed 5 people in the past 2 weeks in a rare
dry-season outbreak. Health officials detected the 1st cases of the
diarrheal disease on 13 Jan 2010 in the town of Bonou, 90 km east of
the economic capital Cotonou, where 66 cases and 4 deaths were
recorded up to 29 Jan 2010, according to the Health Ministry's
director of sanitation Laurent Assogba. Three cases, one resulting in
death, have also been recorded in Cotonou, he said.

Cholera generally spreads during the rainy season when flooding can
contaminate water sources. The World Health Organization (WHO) says
cholera in the dry season is uncommon but it does occur. "Cholera is
not transmitted only via water during heavy rains," Aristide Roch
Sossou of WHO-Benin told IRIN. "Foods [kept in unhygienic conditions]
and dirty hands are also factors favoring cholera." He said studies
are underway to identify the source and transmission mode of the
disease in the latest outbreak.

In 2009 during the rainy season, at least 70 people died of cholera
in Benin, according to the Health Ministry.

According to the head of the department of public health and control
of endemic diseases in Ganda, Daniel Chapo, the villages and
surrounding wards of the district, namely Sisal Lundungo, Indongo,
Lombas and Maias, are the most affected by the outbreak. He pointed
to the lack of basic sanitation in wards and villages as the cause of
the outbreak, having assured that the sector is implementing measures
to contain and prevent the disease.

"We have recorded 6 fatal casualties, and we have 58 patients at

<http://www1.voanews.com/zimbabwe/news/health/Zimbabwe-Another-Cholera-Death-Reported-in-Midlands-11Jan10-81153597.html>


The World Health Organization has reported another death from cholera
in the Midlands province of Zimbabwe, bringing the number of deaths
from the communicable disease in recent months to 6. A WHO report
said there were 149 confirmed cases of cholera and 5 deaths from the
disease between the beginning of September 2009 and 3 Jan 2010. It
said the latest death occurred in Sanyati, Midlands province.

Cholera claimed more than 4200 lives in Zimbabwe from late 2008
through mid-2009 as an epidemic raced out of control due to a
widespread lack of clean water and the virtual collapse of the state
health care system. The WHO said 10 of 62 districts in the country
have been affected by the cholera outbreak recently compared with 51
districts in 2009.

[7] Cholera - Kenya (Nyanza)

Hawking of cooked food in Ugunja Town, Ugenya District has been
banned following a suspected cholera outbreak. The move comes after
10 patients showing cholera symptoms were admitted to Ambira
Sub-District Hospital in Ugenya. Of the 10, one case was confirmed,
according to public health officials.

This forced the officers and Provincial Administration to hold an
emergency meeting to map out strategies on how to curb the spread of
the deadly disease.

Ugenya district commissioner Caroline Onchoka said efforts were being
made to contain it, adding that the public needs to observe proper
hygiene. The administrator said it was worrying that cholera breaks
out in Ugunja Town every 3 months and that steps must be taken to put
a halt to this pattern.

Greater Siaya disease surveillance officer James Sande said 4
patients were still admitted to Ambira hospital.
