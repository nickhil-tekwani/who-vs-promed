_Salmonella_ Outbreak Linked to Fish
------------------------------------
Fast Facts
----------
Illnesses: 33
Hospitalizations: 13
Deaths: 0
States: 3
Recall: No
Investigation status: Active

CDC, public health and regulatory officials in several US states, and FDA are collecting different types of data to investigate a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Litchfield infections. Epidemiologic, laboratory, and traceback data show that fresh fish sold to restaurants by Mariscos Bahia, Inc., may be contaminated with _Salmonella_ and may be making people sick.

Epidemiologic and Traceback Data
--------------------------------
As of 19 Oct 2022, a total of 33 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ Litchfield have been reported from 3 states (see map https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/litchfield-10-22/map.html). Illnesses started on dates ranging from 14 Jun 2022, to 18 Sep 2022 (see timeline https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/litchfield-10-22/epi.html).

State of Residence / Number of Sick People
------------------------------------------
Arizona / 11
California / 21
Illinois / 1

Sick people range in age from 1 to 67 years, with a median age of 32, and 59% are female. Of 26 people with information available, 13 have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported. The true number of sick people in this outbreak is likely much higher than the number reported, and the outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses. This is because many people recover without medical care and are not tested for _Salmonella_. In addition, recent illnesses may not yet be reported as it usually takes 3 to 4 weeks to determine if a sick person is part of an outbreak.

State and local public health officials are interviewing people about the foods they ate in the week before they got sick. Of the 16 people interviewed, 12 (75%) reported eating raw fish, sushi, or poke. This percentage was significantly higher than the 7.9% of respondents who reported eating raw fish in the FoodNet Population Survey -- a survey that helps estimate how often people eat various foods linked to diarrheal illness. This difference suggests that people in this outbreak got sick from eating raw fish. Of 11 people who remembered details of their meal, 9 (82%) reported raw salmon. Several sick people in the outbreak were identified as a part of 3 illness clusters at restaurants. An illness cluster is defined as 2 or more people who do not live in the same household who report eating food from the same retail location before getting sick. If several unrelated sick people ate food from the same retail location, it suggests that the contaminated food item was served or sold there. FDA's investigation traced the source of fresh, raw salmon eaten by sick people in these illness clusters back to Mariscos Bahia, Inc.

Laboratory Data
---------------
Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. CDC PulseNet manages a national database of DNA fingerprints of bacteria that cause foodborne illnesses. DNA fingerprinting is performed on bacteria using a method called whole genome sequencing (WGS). WGS showed that bacteria from sick people's samples are closely related genetically. This suggests that people in this outbreak got sick from the same food.

FDA collected an environmental sample that included multiple swabs at Mariscos Bahia, Inc., in Pico Rivera, California. _Salmonella_ was identified from multiple environmental swabs collected at the facility and WGS analysis is ongoing. WGS completed to date indicates that _Salmonella_ was detected in at least one of the swabs from the facility is the outbreak strain.

WGS of bacteria from one person's sample predicted resistance to ciprofloxacin; analysis of bacteria from 32 samples did not predict resistance to any antimicrobials. Most people with _Salmonella_ illness recover without therapy. However, if treatment is needed, this resistance is unlikely to affect the choice used to treat most people. Standard antibiotic susceptibility testing by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory is currently underway.

Public Health Actions
---------------------
CDC is advising restaurants not to sell or serve salmon, tuna, Chilean sea bass, swordfish, or halibut received on or after 14 Jun 2022, from Mariscos Bahia, Inc. The fish was distributed to restaurants fresh, not frozen. Fish distributed from Mariscos Bahia's locations in Pico Rivera, California, and Phoenix, Arizona, are included.

[Although fish can transmit salmonellosis, they are not generally infected naturally but rather contaminated in processing or storage as what seems to be the case here. All but one of the cases reported here are from residents of California and Arizona, the case from a resident of Illinois seems to be an outlier, perhaps it was acquired in Arizona or California. - Mod.LL
