WHO SURVEILLANCE STANDARDS: MANUAL
==================================
Date: Thu, 24 Apr 1997 15:08:22 -0400
From: owner-wer-reh@sun1.who.ch
WHO/EMC is currently working on a manual for WHO Recommended Surveillance
Standards in the field of communicable disease surveillance. The manual is
being produced jointly by 11 WHO Divisions and Programmes, as well as UNAIDS,
in order to bring together, in a common format, all WHO recommended standards
for surveillance of communicable diseases.
Comments from the various WHO programmes involved and from WHO Regional
Offices are currently being incorporated. The final draft is expected by the
end of May 1997 and the first version ready for distribution in June.
The manual is not intended to replace existing technical guidelines or to be
an exhaustive description of surveillance of all diseases but to be a handy
reference for key elements of surveillance.
For each disease or syndrome there is a description of recommended diagnostic
methods, case definitions, types of surveillance, minimum data elements, data
analyses and principal uses of data for decision making. In addition the
relevant WHO contact(s) are included with contact details. ICD-10 codes are
provided for standardisation of reporting and international data exchange.
