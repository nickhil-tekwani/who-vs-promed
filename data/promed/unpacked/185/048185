Press Notes

Imported case of the new coronavirus detected in Spain

- The patient had travelled to Saudi Arabia
- The patient, who stayed in Saudi Arabia during the month of October [2013], is stable and in good condition
- The case does not present a public health risk in Spain
- The health authorities have followed national and international protocols for management of this case

[6 Nov 2013]
The Ministry of Health, Social Services and Equality has notified the detection of a laboratory confirmed imported case of the new coronavirus [MERS-CoV].

A female resident of Spain, born in Morocco, who had traveled to Saudi Arabia and who is currently admitted to the Puerta de Hierro Hospital in Mahadahonda (Madrid), where appropriate management of the case, including identification and evaluation of possible contacts of the case according to up-to-date protocols established between the Ministry and the CC AA [Autonomous Communities]

The patient, who returned to Spain on [1 Nov 2013], is in a favorable and stable condition [health wise]. Specimens analyzed in the National Microbiology Center were positive for infection with the new coronavirus [MERS-CoV].

The Ministry [of Health, Social Services and Equality] and the Community of Madrid are in the process of identifying all known close contacts of the patient, according to protocols recommended at the national and international level.

One imported case, in which all appropriate measures have been taken, does not pose a risk for the public health in Spain.

Following the established International Health Regulations, the Ministry of Health, Social Services and Equality has notified the World Health Organization as well as the European Rapid Alert Network (EWRS), with whom [the MOH of Spain] is maintaining close follow-up of the situation together with the Health Advisory Group of the Madrid Community.

The new coronavirus
The coronavirus responsible for the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome [MERS-CoV] was identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. The majority of people affected by this virus present with an acute respiratory illness with symptoms of fever, cough and respiratory difficulties.

As of today [6 Nov 2013] there have been 150 confirmed cases reported, 125 of which have been in Saudi Arabia. All of the reported cases had association with 5 countries in the Middle East (Arabia, Jordan, United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Oman). In Europe cases have been reported, of whom were associated with importation from this zone, in 4 other countries: United Kingdom (2 cases), Germany (2 cases), France (1 case) and Italy (1 case).

Spain has 1st MERS case; woman went to Hajj
---------------------
Health officials in Spain have detected the country's 1st case of MERS in a woman who recently returned from Saudi Arabia after attending last month's [October 2013] Hajj pilgrimage.

The Spanish Ministry of Health said the woman was admitted to hospital in Madrid on [1 Nov 2013] and is in stable condition. In its press release, the ministry said it is following up with people who were in contact with her to determine if others have contracted the sickness.

That will likely involve tracking people who travelled on the same plane or planes with the ill woman, who journeyed back to Spain shortly before being hospitalized.

The woman was already sick before she left the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, a World Health Organization expert said Wednesday [6 Nov 2013].

"She became symptomatic while she was in KSA," said Dr. Anthony Mounts, the WHO's point person for the new virus, a cousin of the coronavirus that caused the 2003 SARS outbreak.

"We understand that she did perform the Hajj and came back and was admitted to hospital in Spain and was tested there."

It appears the woman had some contact with the health-care system while in Saudi Arabia, but the details of that are not yet clear.

"I believe that she was checked, but I don't think that she was so severe at that time," said Mounts.

"I don't know anything about whether or not they tested there. ... That's one of the things that we're still trying to get information on."

He also did not know if the woman flew on a commercial airline or on one of the charter flights used by many who travel to Saudi Arabia for the Hajj, the massive annual international pilgrimage that draws Muslims from around the world to their religion's most sacred sites, Mecca and Medina.

This year's Hajj took place from [13-18 Oct 2013], though pilgrims started converging on Saudi Arabia in late September [2013] and typically many remain in the country for a period afterward. This woman is believed to have spent most of the month of October [2013] in the kingdom.

In fact, Mounts said it is possible that she contracted the virus after the pilgrimage was over, which would assuage fears that the event might seed MERS outbreaks in other countries too.

"The concern we had was that the Hajj would accelerate spread, that there would be transmission in the Hajj, during the Hajj itself," he said.

But if investigation of the woman's case leads to the conclusion she became infected after the pilgrimage, her participation in the Hajj will turn out to be coincidental. "And if that's the case, I think it's a little less concerning," Mounts said.

How people contract the virus is still a mystery, but Mounts said this case could provide some important clues.

"If she's had some kind of different exposure than all of the other people who do the Hajj, particularly animal exposures, then we'd be very interested to know about it. That could be very informative."

Countries elsewhere have been on the lookout for illness in their returning pilgrims.

In the past couple of weeks there have been a number of false alarms where people ill with flu-like systems were identified as possible MERS cases. But until now, all have tested negative for the virus.

In fact, Mounts said earlier this week he felt the world might soon be able to conclude that the Hajj had not served as a transmission event to spread the virus from Saudi Arabia -- which has recorded the lion's share of confirmed cases -- to other parts of the globe.

On Wednesday [6 Nov 2013], he said it may be too soon to conclude that yet.

"I think it does give us pause," he said of the case. "I think it means that we really do have to wait a little while longer before we're sure we're out of danger."

With this new case, there have been 151 confirmed cases; 64 of those people have died. And at least 127 of those illnesses were contracted in Saudi Arabia.

All the infections to date have had their roots in the Arabian Peninsula, with Jordan, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Oman also reporting infections.

Several European countries -- Britain, France, Germany, Italy and now Spain -- have reported imported cases of MERS and in a couple of those countries the person who introduced the virus passed it on to one or 2 other people. Tunisia has also reported an imported case, an older man who infected 2 of his adult children.

[3] Geosentinel, screening of returning Hajj pilgrims
Date: 6 Nov 2013
From: Prof. Philippe Parola, MD, PhD,
<pparola@geosentinel.org>


The Hajj is the largest annual mass gathering in the world with nearly [2-Â­3] million Muslims from more than 180 countries making the pilgrimage to the holy places of Islam in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The risk of spread of illnesses via the respiratory route has been previously documented and the risk of virus transmission is of concern (1, 2).

In October 2013, multiple surveillance sites within GeoSentinel, the global surveillance network of the International Society of Travel Medicine (ISTM), have reported ill returnees from the Hajj with respiratory illness. Several have been hospitalized and screened for corona virus (MERS) and other pathogens, including influenza.

Although none of these patients has been found to have been infected with MERS, 7 cases of A influenza (those that have been subtyped have been H3N2) have been identified in these returning Hajj travelers. Three have been identified in France, with 4 from Marseille (among the 1st 10 ill returnees tested) and 1 from Saint-Mande (communicated by Prof. Christophe Rapp) sites, respectively.

Ontario, Canada, has also documented significant influenza activity among Hajj attendees. Public Health Ontario Laboratories have tested 26 patients for MERS-CoV in the month of October, and detected 7 cases of influenza. These include: 5 influenza A(H3N2), 1 influenza A (H1N1) pdm09, in persons who had returned from The Hajj, and 1 A (H1N1)pdm09 in a child of travelers to the Hajj.

Finally, the preliminary results of the systematic detection of respiratory virus among a cohort of 130 pilgrims departed from Marseille, France, and just returned from Mecca, have shown that about 8 percent of them carry influenza viruses (mostly A H3N2, 1 H1N1, and 1 influenza B).

As of [30 Oct 2013] influenza activity remains low in the North American and the European regions (3, 4), however infected returned pilgrims may aid in the early spread of influenza this season in the northern hemisphere.

Influenza vaccine should be a priority for pilgrims attending the Hajj (5, 6).

[This is the 1st case of MERS-CoV imported into Spain and represents the 151st laboratory confirmed infection with the virus. The investigative reporting presented in the media report by Helen Branswell, together with the results of screening of Hajj pilgrims returning to France and Canada by the Geosentinal network, seem to further support the observation [mostly anecdotal] that the MERS-CoV is at present not easily transmitted, either from the as yet unidentified source animal to humans, or from person-to-person. One wonders how good the compliance to the Saudi recommendation that individuals with immunocompromising states as well as signficant co-morbidities refrain from travel to Saudi Arabia for the Hajj this year (the exact recommendation on the Saudi Hajj website states: "The Saudi Ministry of Health recommends that elderly (above 65 years of age) and those with chronic diseases (e.g. heart disease, kidney disease, respiratory disease, diabetes) and pilgrims with immune deficiency (congenital and acquired), Malignancy and terminal illnesses, pregnant women and children (under 12) coming for Hajj and Umrah this year, to postpone the performance of the Hajj and Umrah for their own safety ." http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/Hajj/Pages/Healthregulations.aspx.) Serious illness has been more frequent in individuals with pre-existing co-morbidities; and milder expressions of infection have been seen in previously healthy individuals, including several cases of asymptomatic infection in known contacts of clinical cases.

The findings of the GeoSentinel network -- the isolation of influenza viruses from individuals with acute respiratory illnesses returning from the Hajj are findings that are consistent with previous findings on attendees of the Hajj in the "pre-MERS-CoV" era. Drs. Parola, Gautret and Gubbay's recommendation that influenza vaccination pre-Hajj would be prudent, as the infected returning Hajj pilgrims might be associated with contributing to the spread of influenza virus upon return. If one checks the Saudi MOH Hajj Health recommendations page states: "The Saudi Ministry of Health recommends that international pilgrims be vaccinated against seasonal influenza before arrival into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, particularly those at increased risk of severe influenza diseases, including pregnant women, children under 5 years, the elderly, and individuals with underlying health conditions such as HIV/AIDS, asthma, and chronic heart or lung diseases. In Saudi Arabia, seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended for internal pilgrims, particularly those at risk described above, and all health-care workers in the Hajj premises.". (http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/Hajj/Pages/Healthregulations.aspx).

One of the unknowns at present is whether there have been imported cases into countries with limited resources and infrastructure that may be "under the radar" at present. Hopefully, the lack of reported cases is a true negative.

We await further information on results of investigations surrounding possible exposures the imported case in Spain had while in Saudi Arabia.
