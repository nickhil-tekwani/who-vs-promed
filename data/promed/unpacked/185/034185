1st deaths from tainted water
-----------------------------
5 people have died in the southern USA after coming into contact with
contaminated water after Hurricane Katrina ravaged the Gulf Coast, the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Wed 7 Sep 2005.
Tom Skinner, a spokesperson for the CDC, said there had been one case in
Texas and others in Mississippi this week [1st week September 2005].
He said the 5 had been killed by infections with _Vibrio vulnificus_, "a
bacteria that can enter somebody through a cut, a scratch or a wound."
Skinner said the elderly or those with a fragile immune system were most at
risk.

[It is not surprising that additional deaths have occurred. One of these 5
is probably the Texas case about whom we posted a report yesterday (6 Sep
2005) from a primary source. Only fatal cases are noted here, so the total
number of _V. vulnificus_ cases is probably substantially higher. - Mod.LL]
