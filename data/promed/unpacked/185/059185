["Koi herpesvirus disease (KHVD) is a herpesvirus infection capable of inducing a contagious and acute viraemia in common carp (_Cyprinus carpio_) and varieties such as koi carp and ghost carp

"Following the first reports of KHVD in Israel and Germany in 1998 and detection of KHV DNA in tissue samples taken during a mass mortality of carp in the UK in 1996, the geographical range of the disease has become extensive. The disease has been spread to many countries worldwide, predominantly through the trade in koi carp, before the current knowledge of the disease and means to detect it were available. It is now known to occur in, or has been recorded in, fish imported into at least 28 different countries. In Europe KHV has been detected in many countries across the continent. Most recently KHVD outbreaks have been reported to the OIE from Romania, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden. In Asia, China (Hong Kong), Chinese Taipei, Indonesia, Japan, Korea (Rep. of), Malaysia, Singapore (in fish imported from Malaysia) and Thailand. Elsewhere, South Africa, Canada and the USA have reported occurrence of KHVD. It is likely that the virus is present in many more countries, but has not yet been identified or reported." http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=2439&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_koi_herpesvirus.htm. - Mod.CRD
