The devastated parents of a little boy who died after contracting a
mysterious illness while on holiday in Africa have opened their hearts
about their "perfect" son. The 4-year-old boy died at Gertrude's
Children's Hospital in Nairobi, Kenya last week. The happy and healthy
youngster had been ill for 12 days due to deadly toxins released into
his body by an unidentified bacteria or virus, causing his organs to
shut down. The boy had been on holiday in Uganda with his mother and
father who was near the end of a charity bike ride to raise cash for
the country's Kisiizi Mental Health Hospital when the boy took ill.

His mother, a nursing director at the Cheshire and Wirral Partnership
NHS Trust, said: "My son had not really been himself for a few days,
but we were not really worried. We just put it down to the long flight
and different food. His father set off on his bike ride, and we
travelled to Kisiizi Hospital to meet him at the end. While we were
there, the boy started to suffer stomach pains and diarrhoea, and he
was seen straight away by a doctor. We hoped it was just a 48-hour
bug, but by the 3rd day, we could see it was more serious. By that
time, he had toxins in his body which were starting to affect his
organs and cause internal bleeding."

The boy was flown to Kenya to receive specialist treatment and began
to get better, giving both his family and doctors a shred of hope. "He
was taken off the ventilator and was responding to questions," said
his father, who abandoned his bike ride on the 4th day to be at his
son's bedside. "We hoped he was over the worst, but then we discovered
his other organs were affected. His doctors were devastated when he
died. Nurses were breaking down in tears." His mother added: "There
was nothing anyone could have done. Our son had a team of about 6
consultants, and they were all absolutely brilliant."

No one has been able to pinpoint what caused his illness, which could
have been picked up at home in Halkyn [his Welsh home]. "It could have
been caused by anything," Avril said. "We don't know if it was
something he ate or touched. By the time he was displaying symptoms,
the illness had left him; it was just the toxins that were still
there. Throughout it all, he was so brave. He never complained and had
so much dignity for a little boy of his age. He formed a special
relationship with everyone he met and was so kind. He loved being
outdoors and did everything with us. He even climbed mountains, he
would give anything a go. He loved animals and got to see a lion --
his favourite -- while we were in Uganda, which he absolutely loved."

The boy was due to start school at Ysgol Rhos Helyg, where he had
attended nursery, in September 2011. "It seems such a waste, but we
won't let it be," his father said. "We are planning to set up a
memorial fund in our son's honour and build new hospital facilities in
Uganda with the proceeds. Something good has to come from his death,
as he brought us so much joy. The boy's parents and his 17-year-old
twin sisters were overwhelmed with messages of condolence, which they
say have helped them through. A celebration of the boy's life will be
held at St Mary's Church, Halkyn, on 11 Aug 2011 at 11 AM.

[This report lacks precise information about the deceased child's
symptoms and medical history, other than generalised statements about
stomach pains, diarrhea and general organ failure. The length of the
family's stay in Uganda is also unclear, and it is suggested even that
the child may have contracted his condition before leaving Wales.

Nonetheless, an apparently untreatable illness in Uganda raises the
specter of Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF). In general, outbreaks of EHV
have involved communities. However, recently in Uganda, a single case
of EHF was confirmed on 12 May 2011 after a 12-year-old girl from
Zirobwe Sub County in Luwero district died on 6 May 2011 at Bombo
Military Hospital. No other affected persons were identified other
than the index case, suggesting that perhaps the outbreak virus was
less contagious than previously circulating strains of EHF virus [see
ProMED-mail posts referenced below].

Further information would be welcomed from anyone familiar with the
case of this Welsh child.

Kisiizi Hospital is in southwest Uganda, between Kabale and Rukungiri.
It is in the Kigezi highlands and is about 5300 feet above sea level.
