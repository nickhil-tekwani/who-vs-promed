We read with interest the recent Promed posting (PNEUMONIA, OVINE - USA: (ARIZONA) BIGHORN SHEEP [20160105.3911283]) on 5 Jan 2016. Moderator TG observed that: "In the past, pneumonia affecting bighorn sheep has been considered a multi-factorial disease. However, this article seems to say that there is a definite bacterium and that it is the same bacterium that caused at least 2 other outbreaks in other regions."

The definite bacterium being referred to is _Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae_. Yes, epizootic pneumonia of bighorn sheep is a multi-factorial disease, but an emerging body of evidence (e.g. PMID 23253148, 25302992, 22247385) indicates that the disease is a polymicrobial pneumonia that is initiated by _M. ovipneumoniae_ infection.

The mycoplasma infection is thought to interfere with mucociliary clearance, leading to secondary infections with multiple, diverse pharyngeal and ruminal bacteria. Pasteurellaceae are prominent among the lung bacteria that grow aerobically from affected lung tissues (leading to the previous strong presumption that Pasteurellaceae play a causal role in bighorn sheep pneumonia), but both 16S culture independent studies and conventional anaerobic cultures indicate that _Fusobacterium necrophorum_ and diverse other obligate anaerobic species represent the bulk of the secondary (lethal) infections.

The molecular epidemiology of _M. ovipneumoniae_ also strongly supports its role as the primary agent in the polymicrobial epizootic disease: a single MLST strain type (publication of this method is pending) of _M. ovipneumoniae_ is detected in most or all affected animals within outbreaks, while the predominant secondary bacteria populations vary greatly from animal to animal. Typically, _M. ovipneumoniae_ MLST strain types differ in independent bighorn pneumonia epizootics that likely result from independent spillover events from domestic sheep or goats (both species that carry a broad diversity of _M. ovipneumoniae_ MLST strain types even within individual herds).

In contrast, single MLST strain types are frequently seen to spread within metapopulations, most likely resulting from movements of acutely infected or recovered, chronic carrier bighorn sheep. This seems to be the case for the recent outbreak in the Black Mountains of Arizona, which is an identical MLST strain type to that detected in recent years in other Mojave Desert bighorn sheep populations including the Old Dad Mountains and nearby ranges in California as well as the Spring Ranges and adjacent ranges in southern Nevada.

Unfortunately, the robust bighorn sheep populations in these ranges, interconnected by periodic animal movements, offer the potential for devastating spread of highly contagious pathogens such as _M. ovipneumoniae_.
