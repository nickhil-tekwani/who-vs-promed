There are 3 more people who have lost their lives in Assam due to Japanese encephalitis (JE) on Tuesday [12 Jul 2022]. Till now, 13 people died due to the infection this month [July 2022] in the state. Meanwhile, Assam reported 17 more cases of Japanese encephalitis in the past 24 hours, taking the tally of the infected people to 115 this month, reported PTI.

Of the 3 deaths on Tuesday [12 Jul 2022], 2 were from Jorhat and one from Golaghat. As per officials, Jorhat also reported 6 new cases of Japanese encephalitis, while 3 were detected in Sivasagar.

Of the 17 cases of the disease, 2 each were reported from Nagaon, Dhemaji and Sonitpur, along with one each from Dhubri and Kamrup (Metro). Principal Secretary (Health) Avinash Joshi directed all districts of the state to constitute a District Rapid Response team on acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) and JE by Saturday [16 Jul 2022].

Notably, Japanese encephalitis is a viral brain infection. It spreads through mosquito bites. Every year, many people were killed in the state due to Japanese encephalitis and malaria, especially during the monsoon flood season between May and October.

The flood condition in Assam improved significantly on Tuesday [12 Jul 2022].

[The cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) in Assam continue to increase rapidly. In just the past 6 days, the number of deaths has increased from 6 to 13, and the number of JE cases from 48 to 115. There are 17 new JE cases in the past 24 hours. Interestingly, none of these 115 cases was classified as acute encephalitis syndrome, as was the situation for those 48 cases in a previous ProMED post (see Japanese encephalitis & other - India (06): (AS) 20220707.8704289). However, the state District Rapid Response team on acute encephalitis syndrome and JE that will be constituted soon will be dealing with any non-JE AES cases that are diagnosed in the area.

No mention is made in the above report if any of these affected individuals reported above had been vaccinated against JE or if a vaccination campaign is planned. Flooding may have increased the area of breeding of JE virus vector mosquitoes. This is the season of active JE virus transmission, so more cases are likely to occur over the next 3 months. A vaccine against JE is available and is often used in northeastern India where the virus is endemic. - Mod.TY
