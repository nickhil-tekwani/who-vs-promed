Scotland prey to new strain of _E. coli_ killer bug
------------------------------------------------
A new strain of the deadly _E. coli_ bug that can pass through the standard
safety checks undetected has been discovered in Scotland for the first
time. A nationwide alert has been issued after 4 people were found to have
become infected with the bacteria -- which can cause death through kidney
failure and brain damage -- in the past 3 months.

The first case became ill in June 2003 with what appeared to be a stomach
infection. It was only when complex scientific tests (which take several
days to complete) were carried out that they were found to have the bug,
called _E. coli_ O26. While the infected people survived, experts warned
that young children and elderly people who contract the bug could die.

It is as dangerous as _E. coli_ O157 -- which caused the deaths of 17
people in an outbreak in Wishaw, Lanarkshire -- but scientists are worried
that because it is so hard to detect, it will be able to spread across the
country before emergency procedures can be set up. Medical labs throughout
Scotland have been warned to look out for the microorganism, and the public
are being advised to be extra vigilant about hygiene.

5 people were discovered with non-O157 strains of _E. coli_: 2 siblings
from the Ayrshire and Arran health board area, one from the Forth Valley
region, another from Lothian, and the 5th from Tayside. 4 had the O26
strain and one had another strain, called O113.

Professor Hugh Pennington, who led the inquiry into the Wishaw outbreak,
said: "In the majority of cases with O26, the person recovers without any
need for a particular treatment. But there is some mortality among the
under-5s and over-70s. This is something we've been looking for quite a
long time: basically it's new to Scotland. The problem is that although we
have some simple tests for picking out O157 among other bacteria, we don't
have that for O26, so it can hide more easily. Labs don't have a simple
test available, and it's unlikely they will have in the near future. What
we're therefore concerned about is that the O26 type might get commoner
without us realizing it. We don't know why this bug has come in or where
it's come from, and we have to keep a very sharp eye on it."

Pennington, of Aberdeen University, said careful monitoring by hospital
labs should be combined with simple precautions by the public. These
include taking care on farms, where children may come into contact with the
bug if it is present in animal droppings. Hand-washing after going to the
toilet is also essential.

The Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health, which oversees
the surveillance of dangerous bugs, has urged hospital labs to send samples
from any patients with suspicious symptoms.

Many O26 bugs are relatively harmless and live unnoticed in the gut of
humans and farm animals. However, it can produce a virulent poison called
verotoxin, which attacks organs such as the kidneys. It can cause symptoms
ranging from a mild stomach upset to kidney failure and brain damage.

Like O157, _E. coli_ O26 is thought to have evolved only in the last 20
years. In November 1996, _E. coli_ O157 killed 17 elderly people in Wishaw,
and another 500 were made ill after eating contaminated meat products from
a butcher shop in the town.

Pennington's landmark report later made 32 recommendations on how to handle
such foods to avoid contamination, and an _E. coli_ taskforce was set up by
the Scottish Executive to maintain vigilance about outbreaks.

Shadow health minister Shona Robison said: "It's very concerning that this
new strain is around in Scotland. We need to raise public awareness again,
to ensure we never again have another outbreak like the one in Lanarkshire."

David Davidson, Scottish Tory health spokesman, added: "It's incumbent on
health minister Malcolm Chisholm to ensure that immediate research is
conducted into how this infection can best be detected."

A Scottish Executive spokesman said: "We are aware of the O26 type of _E.
coli_, and it is essential to remain vigilant. The _E. coli_ taskforce,
although primarily concerned with _E. coli_ O157, also looked at other
types, and its recommendations apply to O26 as much as to O157."

Simple precautions can minimise the risk of infection by _E. coli_. Animal
droppings on pasture are the greatest worry, especially where there are
concentrations of animals and wet conditions. _E. coli_ can survive in soil
and droppings for weeks and can easily be transferred to boots and shoes.
Ideally, fields used for grazing animals should not be used for camping,
picnicking, or play areas. Anyone using such sites should always wash their
hands before eating and drinking.

[Although much attention has been paid to O157:H7 strains of _E. coli_ that
(by virtue of toxin production) cause enterohemorrhagic disease with or
without hemolytic-uremic syndrome, other serotypes of _E. coli_ have been
associated with this illness as well.

_E. coli_ strains can be grouped by the presence of their O (somatic) and H
(flagellar) antigens, hence O157:H7. The toxins produced are generally one
or 2 Shiga toxins (stx1 and stx 2) as well as eae, a protein intimin that
is responsible for intinmate attachment of the organism and mucosal
effacing lesions and other virulence factors including E-hly, espA, etp and
katP.

Other _E. coli_ serogroups that have been associated with VTEC disease
include motile ones such as O26:H11 and O104:H21 and nonmotile ones such as
O111:NM (or H-). Such non-O157 isolates can be obtained from sheep and
cattle and although causing as much as 30 percent of outbreaks of VTEC (1),
appear to be somewhat less or at least more variable in virulence in a
variety of in vivo and in vitro assays (2-4). In analyzing the genetic and
phenotypic profiles of non-O157 groups, it has been found that they belong
to their own lineages and have unique profiles of virulence traits
different from O157 (5). The serogroups appearing to be most prominent are
O26, O111, O128, and O103 (6).

If a laboratory is using sorbitol-MacConkey (sMAC) plates to identify VTEC
by virtue of O157's ability to ferment sorbitol, the non-O157 strains will
be missed. In a 3-year pediatric study from the University of Washington,
USA (7), 1851 stool samples were processed for sorbitol fermentation as
well as toxin production by EIA, and 28 strains of O157 were found along
with O103 (4 strains), O118 (2 strains), O111 (2 strains), and 3 other strains.

Clinically, the O157 infections had a higher frequency of bloody stools,
fecal leukocytes, and abdominal pain with shorter symptom duration. 5 (18
percent) of O157 infections developed hemolytic-uremic syndrome; none of
the non-O157 strains did. Since toxin assay did not identify all O157
strains found on sMAC plates, the investigators did not advocate performing
toxin assay alone. Non-O157 can produce hemolytic-uremic syndrome, as
demonstrated by a cluster of O121 cases associated with a lake in
Connecticut, USA (8).

Since toxin assays are not uniformly performed in many areas, and most
cases do not produce hemolytic-uremic syndrome, it is likely that cases due
to non-O157 strains are being missed. How frequent this phenomenon will
become over time is unclear.
