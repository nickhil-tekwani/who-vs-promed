A total of 4 UW [University of Wisconsin] Hospital patients have developed Legionnaires' disease, an unusual cluster of the potentially fatal bacterial infection likely caused by a recent move to reduce water flow when demand is low, a hospital official said Wednesday [28 Nov 2018].

Of the 4 patients, 3 remain at the hospital in fair condition, said Dr. Nasia Safdar, the hospital's medical director of infection control. She said they have other medical problems that may have been made worse by Legionnaires' disease, a type of pneumonia caused by bacteria typically present at low concentrations in tap water.

One patient has been discharged. The 4 patients, all being treated with antibiotics, range in age from 45 to 80 years. Other cases are possible within the next 2 weeks, the bacterium's incubation period, after the hospital planned to extensively chlorinate its water system to kill the bug late Wednesday [28 Nov 2018], Safdar said.

No patients at the hospital were allowed to take showers late Tuesday [27 Nov 2018] or on Wednesday [28 Nov 2018] because Legionnaires' disease spreads in airborne droplets from hot water. It is not spread from person to person.

American Family Children's Hospital is not affected, officials said.

The unusual cases of Legionnaires' disease, which can be especially harmful to patients sick enough to require hospitalization before exposure, were likely caused by an effort started about 3 weeks ago to save water by curbing flow at low-demand times, Safdar said. Bacteria can grow more, and potentially hazardous biofilms can form, when water is more stagnant, she said. "The system becomes more vulnerable then," Safdar said. "I don't know for sure that that was the problem, but I can't think of what else it might have been." The reduced flow program has stopped and will not resume, she said.

Of the 4 patients, 2 had been recently hospitalized at UW Hospital and discharged before reporting to other facilities with symptoms of pneumonia. They were returned to UW Hospital, and another one has been there for several weeks.

Urine tests on all 4 patients, conducted within the past 10 days, were positive for Legionnaires' disease [The urine test detects an antigen in urine produced by only one type of _Legionella_, _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1, which is the most common cause of Legionnaires' disease. - Mod.ML]. The hospital plans to collect bacteria samples from the patients to see whether they share the same strain and the strain discovered in 2 of their shower stalls.

Positive tests have been found only in parts of the hospital, but the problem is believed to be facility-wide. "Once it's in the hot water, it could be anywhere," Safdar said. "The assumption is that the entire hospital needs to be mitigated." She said the Legionnaires' bacterium is ubiquitous in large complex facilities. "If you need medical care, you're not going to find a healthcare facility where Legionnaire's hasn't been recovered at some point," she said.

In 2010, a waterfall at a Milwaukee-area hospital was named as the source of an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease, prompting St. Mary's Hospital in Madison [Wisconsin] to shut down 2 decorative water walls for testing. At the time, UW Hospital kept its 3 water walls running, and UnityPoint Health-Meriter closed one of its 2 waterfalls for mechanical repairs.

Until this month [November 2018], UW Hospital had not had any cases of Legionnaires' disease acquired at the hospital in 23 years, the hospital said in a statement. Safdar attributed that to a copper-silver ionization system that disinfects the water.

Nationwide, about 6100 cases of Legionnaires' disease were reported in 2016, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). That figure is likely an underestimate, as many cases go undiagnosed. About one in 10 people who get sick from Legionnaires' disease will die, the CDC says. Among people infected at hospitals, nursing homes and other healthcare facilities, roughly one in 4 will die, the agency said last year [2017].

"Legionnaires' disease in hospitals is widespread, deadly, and preventable," Dr. Anne Schuchat, then acting director of the CDC, said at the time. "Controlling these bacteria in water systems can be challenging, but it is essential to protect patients."

Legionnaires' disease is named for a 1976 outbreak at an American Legion convention in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], which hospitalized more than 200 people and killed 34. Cold tap water poses no risk, officials said. Healthy patients who may inhale water droplets with the bacteria are at low risk. Those at higher risk are people older than 50 years and those with lung disease or compromised immune systems.

UW Hospital said it monitors its water routinely and whenever a patient is suspected to have Legionnaires' disease. The hospital notified the state Division of Public Health of the situation.

[_Legionella_ are gram-negative bacteria that embed in a biofilm that lines the inner walls of the plumbing system's pipes and containers. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 deg C [77-104 deg F] support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems.

Debilitated hospitalized patients who are prone to aspiration may develop Legionnaires' disease following aspiration of _Legionella_-contaminated potable water, as well as inhaling a fine spray (aerosols) from water sources containing _Legionella_. Possible person-to-person transmission has also been described [Correia AM, Gon√ßalves J, Gomes JP, et al: Probable person-to-person transmission of Legionnaires' disease. N Engl J Med 2016;374(5):497-8; http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356].

During the epidemiological and environmental investigation for the source of _Legionella_ organisms, patients should be prohibited from taking showers, and should consume sterile water only until _Legionella_ becomes undetectable by culture of the hospital water.

Molecular typing of clinical isolates of _Legionella_ can help identify a common source outbreak if the genotypes of clinical isolates match. Molecular typing of environmental isolates of _Legionella_ can help identify the source of the outbreak, if the environmental genotype matches the genotype of the clinical isolates.

University of Wisconsin Hospital is a 592-bed academic medical center in Madison, Wisconsin; it is an American College of Surgeons-designated Level I adult and pediatric trauma center, one of 2 Level I trauma centers in Wisconsin, and has 6 intensive care units (trauma and life support, pediatric, cardiac, cardiothoracic, burn, neurosurgery) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Wisconsin_Hospital_and_Clinics). - Mod.ML
