The number of confirmed typhoid cases in Fiji has now reached 100 and
thousands more are at risk. The outbreak, which is blamed on
contaminated water caused by heavy rains and flooding, has claimed 2
lives so far.
The director of public health, Dr Josaia Samuela, says officials have
confirmed more cases this week.
"For the northern division we have 95 cases up from the initial 77,
the central division has not reported any new cases, but for the
western division we had 5 new cases reported within the past one or 2
weeks."

The Health Ministry is advising the public to refrain from drinking
yaqona in the wake of typhoid reports. A major cause for the spread
of typhoid is drinking contaminated water and eating contaminated
food or poor hygiene.
Acting director Public Health, Dr Josaia Samuela, said there was no
scientific proof of the effects of yaqona on the disease but there
were risks.
"Typhoid is spread through unhygienic practices through food and
water, sanitation, and surroundings. Yaqona drinking involves people
mixing the drink, who could be carrying the bacteria and it could
spread," Dr Samuela said.
"It is advisable for people to stay away from drinking yaqona in such
circumstances for their health benefit."
In the wake of the typhoid disease spreading in Fiji, visitors have
been warned not to [travel] to Fiji. The Noumea Ocean Flash said
French authorities in New Caledonia have warned citizens to avoid
traveling to Fiji.

[A discussion on yaqona (kava) is below and was extracted from
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kava>:
Kava (_Piper methysticum_) is an ancient crop of the western Pacific.
Other names for kava include 'awa (Hawaii), 'ava (Samoa), yaqona
(Fiji), and sakau (Pohnpei). The word kava is used to refer to both
the plant and the beverage produced from it.
The extract is an emulsion, consisting of suspended kavalactone
droplets in a starchy suspension. The taste is slightly pungent,
while the distinctive aroma varies depending on whether it's been
prepared from dry or fresh material, and by variety. The colour is
grey to tan to opaque greenish. Various sources incorrectly state
that preparation technique of mastication potentiates the
psychoactive effects of kava because of the action of saliva enzymes
on the plant. Although chewing kava does produce a more powerful
effect than any other form of preparation, this is not the result of
any chemical process; rather, this is due to the much finer particles
produced in this method.
Fijians commonly share a drink called Grog that is prepared by
pounding sun-dried kava root into a fine powder and mixing it with
cold water. Traditionally, Grog is drunken from the shorn half-shell
of a coconut, called a bilo. Despite tasting very much like dirty
water [and perhaps starting with dirty water - Mod.LL], Grog is very
popular in Fiji, especially among young men, and often serves to
bring people together for storytelling and socializing.
The effects of drinking kava, in order of sensation, are slight
tongue and lip numbing caused by the contraction of the blood vessels
in these areas (the lips and skin surrounding may appear unusually
pale); mildly talkative and euphoric behavior; anxiolytic (calming)
effects, sense of well-being, clear thinking; and relaxed muscles.
Sleep is often restful and there are pronounced periods of sleepiness
correlating to the amount and potency of Kava consumed.
When drunk to excess, kava can cause vomiting and a feeling of nausea
that will subside usually by the end of the day after consumption. In
Vanuatu, drinking strong kava is normally followed by a hot meal or
tea. Meals consumed along with kava traditionally follow some time
after the beverage so that the psychoactives are absorbed into the
bloodstream more quickly.
A drink of high potency results in a faster onset with a lack of
stimulation, somnolence, and then deep, dreamless sleep within 30
minutes. Unlike alcohol-induced sleep, after wakening the drinker
does not experience any mental or physical after effects.
Heavy consumption of kava can produce dermatological effects ranging
from light, red bumps to heavy, scaly, ulcerous skin. Kava contains
lactones that bind to skin proteins forming antigens, which then lead
to the allergic response. Discontinuation or reduction of consumption
resolves the effects.
There have been indications of severe liver toxicity, including liver
failure in some people who had used dietary supplements containing
kava extract. The severity of liver damage consequently prompted
action of many regulatory agencies in some countries." - Mod.LL]

<http://www.gmanews.tv/story/38682/Zambo-typhoid-outbreak-traced-to-shallow-wells>

City health officials in Zamboanga City have ordered closed shallow
tube wells that they believed caused an outbreak of typhoid fever in
at least 2 villages there.
SunStar Zamboanga reported Tuesday [17 Apr 2007] that city health
officer, Rodel Agbulos, ordered all shallow tube wells in the area
closed to prevent the spread of typhoid.
Agbulos informed Mayor Celso Lobregat that they were able to trace
the cause of the typhoid fever to the drinking of water taken from
the shallow tube, which the report said is not potable.
He said the water coming from shallow tube wells is only good for
washing and bathing and not to be used for drinking.
Earlier reports indicated at least one child had died, while 47
people from Campo Islam village were admitted at the Zamboanga City
Medical Center.
A shallow tube well is usually 20 feet deep from the surface of the
earth and is susceptible to contamination.
"Maybe they used the shallow tube well water for drinking in order to
save expenses in buying from their neighbors who are concessionaires
of the water district," Lobregat said.
Lobregat added the residents apparently "did not realize the after
effect since it is not safe for drinking."
