A meningitis epidemic in northwestern Uganda has killed 27 people,
infected about 930, and has been hampering efforts to return Sudanese
refugees home, officials said on Wed 7 Feb 2007.
Ugandan health officials said the government is embarking on a
program to vaccinate up to 400 000 people in the region wedged
between the border lines of Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
"By Tue 6 Feb 2007, up to 930 cases had so far been recorded, with 27
deaths," Dr. Patrick Anguzu, a senior health official in the West
Nile region told Deutsche Presse-Agentur dpa by telephone.
UN refugee officials said on Wed 7 Feb 2007 that a program to
repatriate some of the tens of thousands of Sudanese refugees back
home from Uganda is still under suspension due to the meningitis
outbreak, which began in early January 2007.

Schools attended by 4 children infected with meningitis have sent out
notices to parents informing them to watch out for symptoms of the
disease. The announcement came after health officials this week said
that 4 children living in the same building in Deira had been
diagnosed with the bacterial strain of meningitis.
Management of the Our Own Indian School (OOIS) informed parents that
2 of these children, a brother and sister, were from the kindergarten
section of their school. A similar notice was also circulated in Our
Own English School, where the 3rd child studied. The 4 children are
in a stable condition in hospital.

[The bacterial agent is not stated but is likely to be _N.
meningitidis_, given the clustering. Dubai is the most populous and
2nd largest emirate of the United Arab Emirates, after Abu Dhabi.
