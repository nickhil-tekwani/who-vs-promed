There will be a briefing for local sheep breeders in South Australia
tonight, following the detection of Ovine Johnes disease in a prime stud
merino district in the mid north.
The Primary Industries Department says the fatal sheep wasting condition
has been detected in a flock on the Woolana stud at Mount Bryan, near Burra.
It is the first such detection in the area, and the source and extent of
the infection are still being investigated.
The State's chief veterinarian Doctor Robin Vandegraaff says it is
fortunate that it is a small stud.
"There's been little stud business done by this property over the last 3 or
4 years, so the opportunities for spread have been limited," Dr Vandegraaff
said. "The other thing is that this property is extremely secure. "My
information is that it is surrounded by a double boundary fence for most of
the fencing," he said. "It's also as I understand it is surrounded on two
sides by either a road or rail or both."

[Ovine-Johnes, like Johnes in other animals is caused by _Mycobacterium
paratuberculosis_. It causes a wasting condition characterized by gradual
but profound emaciation. In sheep, death generally occurs within 6 months.
According to the New South Wales Agricultural Department, mortality in
flocks to be low with the disease seen primarily in older sheep. However,
in flocks with heavy infestation, animals less than 2 years old may die
from it. The disease is endemic in NSW, Victoria, and Tasmania and has been
reported in the southeast of South Australia. This report from the northern
region of South Australia indicates the disease is spreading.
