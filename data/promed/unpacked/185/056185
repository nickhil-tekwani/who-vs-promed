The Mexican island of Cozumel, in the Caribbean and just a ferry ride
from Playa del Carmen, has reported an outbreak of Legionnaires'
disease at 2 popular hotel properties. Travelers were alerted by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is based in
Atlanta. The CDC says that the outbreak is confined to just 2
resorts, the Regency Club Vacation Resort, which is a timeshare
property, and the Wyndham Cozumel Resort and Spa (formerly the Reef
Club Cozumel).

Cancellation fees for current and future guests have been suspended
at the Wyndham. Since May of 2008, there have been 9 cases of
Legionnaires' disease confirmed among U.S. and Dutch visitors to the
resorts. The most recent case was in October of last year [2010], so
the outbreak has continued on and off for more than 2 years.

A statement from Wyndham's management said the water systems at the
resort had been disinfected and have also been "monitored and
approved by state and federal government health authorities in Mexico."

Cozumel has long been a favorite of Minnesota tourists and is less
than 4 hours away, non-stop, from the Minneapolis/St. Paul
International Airport via both Delta and Sun Country airlines. It is
a more traditional Mexican destination and far different from its
lively, non-stop action neighbors to the west, Cancun and Riviera
Maya. Cozumel has long been a favorite diving destination for
visitors from around the globe.

A form of pneumonia, Legionnaires' disease is transmitted by the
inhalation of bacteria-contaminated water. Hot tubs, cooling towers,
spray misters, shower heads and faucets are a common source of the
bacterium. It is not transmitted between people. The disease was
named during an outbreak at an American Legion convention in
Philadelphia in 1976.

[Legionellosis is an infectious disease caused by a Gram-negative
bacillus of the genus _Legionella_, most commonly _Legionella
pneumophila_. Legionnaires' disease is the acute pneumonic form of
the disease; about 70 per cent of cases are due to _L. pneumophila_
serogroup 1. Pontiac fever is a non-pneumonic form of legionellosis
that is less severe than Legionnaires' disease. Pontiac fever takes
its name from an outbreak in 1968 in Pontiac, Michigan, USA. Risk
factors for Legionnaires' disease include age over 50 years,
cigarette smoking, diabetes, chronic heart or lung disease, and
immunosuppression.

Legionnaires' disease, and possibly Pontiac fever, is usually
acquired by inhalation by a susceptible person of an infectious dose
of aerosolized _Legionella_. Usually, a building's contaminated water
system is incriminated as the source. _Legionella_ are found
primarily in the hot water portion of plumbing systems and in cooling
towers. Water temperatures of 25-40 C (77-104 F) support the highest
concentrations of the organism in water storage tanks of plumbing
systems. Aerosolization of the contaminated warm water can occur in
showers, spa pools, sprays in groceries, fountains, and cooling
towers. Elimination or reduction of legionella colonization in a hot
water system is difficult. For a discussion, please see
<http://www.dhmh.state.md.us/html/legionella.htm>.

Genotyping of patient and environmental isolates has become a helpful
tool to establish transmission pathways. The predominance of one
genotype in patient specimens suggests transmission from a common
source. Because _L. pneumophila_ may be found in water supplies
without linkage to any cases of legionellosis, the actual causative
infectious reservoir should be demonstrated by means of genotyping
methods (see <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC86783/> and
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730281/>).

Cozumel, a tourist destination, is an island in the Caribbean Sea, 20
km (12 miles) off the eastern coast of Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula,
opposite the town of Playa del Carmen and 60 km (36 miles) south of
the coastal city of Cancun. Cozumel is one of the 9 municipalities of
the state of Quintana Roo. The main town on the island is San Miguel
de Cozumel (<http://maps.thefullwiki.org/Cozumel>).
