An outbreak of chikungunya, a mosquito-transmitted viral disease, has
affected at least 36 000 people in 9 districts of the state, according to
the state government.
Incidents of the disease have also been reported from Andhra Pradesh and
Maharashtra in the last few weeks. The disease, which is caused by an
alphavirus and is spread by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, causes the
bone-breaking dengue[-like] fever. It has co-existed with dengue for
several years, but is underdiagnosed, according to virologists, for 2 reasons.
First, unlike dengue, it is not fatal, but self-limiting (it vanishes by
itself). Secondly, the diagnosis of the disease is not easy even through
blood tests.
"It has been there for a long time. Outbreaks occur mostly after the rainy
season. This time, it has come to light because it was more severe with
joint and muscular pain, red eyes and high fever," said Dr C Nagaraj,
research officer, regional office for health and family welfare, Government
of India.
The issue figured in the legislative assembly on Thu [7 Apr 2006]. Health
and family welfare minister R Ashok said the mosquito thrives on human
blood only during the day and breeds only in clean water. The immediate
remedy is to go in for mosquito nets.
"In addition to seeking fogging machines from Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra,
we have released Rs 1 400 000 [USD 31 461] per district to control the
disease," he said.
Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra have been severely affected by
the disease this time. More than 36 000 cases have been reported in
Karnataka alone, with Gulbarga district topping with 17 000 cases. Other
affected districts include Tumkur, Bidar, Raichur, Bellary, Chitradurga,
Davanagere, Kolar and Bijapur.
"Samples from Bidar, Gulbarga, Raichur, Bellary and Tumkur districts sent
to Pune's National Institute of Virology have tested positive, while
results of remaining districts are awaited," Ashok said.
To combat the disease, committees, headed by respective deputy
commissioners and the tahsildar and district health officers, have been
constituted in the affected districts.
