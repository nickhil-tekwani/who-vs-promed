DENGUE - INDIA

Of 70 suspected cases of dengue in New Delhi, 10 have been confirmed by the
All-India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) and announced by Dr. Kiran
Dambalkar, chief medical officer of the Delhi Dengue Control Cell. The
latest 2 cases are a 19-year old female and a 28-year old male.
The number of suspected cases [may not reflect the actual situation]
because physicians are referring all fever cases for testing after local
authorities threatened to prosecute those who do not report dengue patients.

[I wonder whether even 70 suspect cases of dengue is an increase or a
decrease from the number one would expect in New Delhi at this time of
year. Still, if 14% of fever cases are due to a dengue virus, one might
expect that there are many cases of dengue in New Delhi at this time. The
situation in the entirety of India is unknown to us. -- Mod CHC]
