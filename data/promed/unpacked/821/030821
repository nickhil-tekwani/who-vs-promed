1st Viet Nam bird flu death in 2010
-----------------------------------
A 38 year old woman has become the 1st victim [fatal case] of bird flu in
Viet Nam in 2010, bringing the country's toll from avian influenza to 58,
the health ministry said on Friday [26 Feb 2010]. The woman died on Tuesday
[23 Feb 2010] in the southern province of Tien Giang after 2 days of
unsuccessful hospital treatment, said the Ministry in an online statement.

The victim had killed and cooked sick waterfowl, the statement added. Viet
Nam's last death from the H5N1 virus was in December [2009]. At present,
outbreaks of bird flu among poultry have been reported in 5 provinces. Viet
Nam ranks 2nd after Indonesia for the highest bird flu death toll,
according to the World Health Organization.

[Previously it was reported that a 3 year old girl in the central province
of Khanh Hoa has tested positive for avian influenza H5N1 virus infection,
becoming the country's 1st bird flu patient in 2010, according to a
Ministry of Health report on Mon 22 Feb 2010 (see: Avian influenza, human
(16): Viet Nam (KH) 20100224.0613).

According to WHO's table of confirmed human cases of H5N1 virus infection
dated 17 Feb 2010
(<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2010_02_17/en/index.html>),
this case became the 113th case overall since the beginning of the outbreak
in 2003. The fatal case in Tien Giang province described above therefore
becomes the 114th case and the 58th fatality in Viet Nam.
