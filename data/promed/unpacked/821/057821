WHO: several recent MERS patients drank camel milk
--------------------------------------------------
In an update on 7 recent MERS-CoV cases in Saudi Arabia, the World Health Organization (WHO) said yesterday [16 Oct 2014] that 4 of the patients drank camel's milk and had frequent contact with camels.

[The Saudi Ministry of Health's (MOH's) MERS-CoV page shows that on 21 Oct 2014, the country's total accumulated case count was 771 --431 recovered, 328 died, and 12 under treatment].

The WHO update provides information on 7 cases, with one death, reported by the MOH between 29 Sep and 11 Oct 2014. All the patients were men at least 50 years old, and 5 were in their 60s or 70s. 4 of the patients had preexisting illnesses, often drank camel milk, and had frequent contact with camels, according to WHO. Camels are known to harbor MERS-CoV and are seen as a likely source of human cases, but exactly how they pass the virus to humans has not been determined.

One of the men who had camel exposure, a 51 year old from the city of Haradh, died on 5 Oct 2014, WHO said.

The agency signaled that 2 other patients had possible exposure to camels; exposures in one case were still under investigation, and the other involved a man in Najran who reported no contact with camels but lives in an area with many camel farms.

None of the patients were reported to be health care workers. Information in the WHO statement generally matches up with recent reports by the MOH, but the locations differ in 2 cases.

[The cited WHO update of 16 Oct 2014 is available at http://www.who.int/csr/don/16-october-2014-mers/en/ (see item 3 in ProMED-mail 20141016.2871081). Could the animals/farm from which the suspected milk was derived be traced back and tested?

The role of camel milk in the epidemiology of MERS-CoV, suspected on the basis of some circumstantial indications, has been supported by the results of observations in Qatar, published in June 2014 (ref 1 and ProMED-mail 20140613.2537848).

MERS-CoV presence in milk or meat of infected camels has not been addressed in the small-scale experimental infection trial in camels, published recently and discussed (ProMED-mail 20140929.2813981). Definite laboratory based confirmation of milk-borne MERS-CoV infection in humans is yet to be established.

Since October 2013, MERS-CoV has been detected in dromedary camels in Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, and UAE and in a bat in Saudi Arabia.

A recent laboratory-based study of human MERS-CoV outbreaks in Jeddah and Riyadh includes some data on 5 MERS-CoV strains sampled from camels in November 2013 in Taif and Jeddah, Saudi Arabia (see Table 2 "Single nucleotide polymorphisms in Jeddah-type viruses and reference viruses", ref 2, page 13).

Qatar, Oman, and Kuwait have reported to the OIE cases of MERS-CoV infection in camels as an "emerging disease". Saudi Arabia, the country with most human cases, has not (yet) notified to the OIE MERS-CoV infection in camels.
