A fatal disease has been discovered in bats in 4 Illinois counties including Monroe, the state department of natural resources reported recently. The other 3 counties were LaSalle, Hardin, and Pope.

Northern long-eared and little brown bats from these counties were collected in February [2013] and submitted for testing at state labs, where the disease was confirmed.

White nose syndrome is not known to infect people or other animals but is almost always fatal to bats. The disease is primarily spread among bats, but lives in a fungus that may be carried across caves and mines on visitors' shoes and clothes.

So far, 20 states including Missouri have confirmed incidents of the disease in bats since it was first discovered in New York in 2006. The disease is concentrated in the northeastern US but has been discovered as far west as Oklahoma. It has killed an estimated 6 million bats in North America. White nose syndrome interrupts bats' hibernation, waking them up in the winter months when there are fewer insects to eat.

Biologists are concerned that the loss of bat species could cause the mosquito and insect populations to grow unchecked, leading to destruction of crops and the spread of diseases that infect humans like West Nile virus. Scientists have not found a way to prevent the spread of white nose syndrome.

"We are saddened by the discovery of WNS in Illinois," said Jeremy Coleman of the US Fish and Wildlife Service, in a statement. "We will continue to work with our partners to address this devastating disease and work towards conservation of bat species in North America."

By 2010, Illinois officials had closed all caves on government land to try to stop the spread of the disease. Many public caves in Missouri have been closed, but most caves are on private land.

[A very sad discovery. While closing caves to public traffic undoubtedly helps diminish the risk of transmission it clearly does not eliminate it completely. ProMED-mail post 20130221.1552480 states that caves closed to the public still have been found to have WNS.
