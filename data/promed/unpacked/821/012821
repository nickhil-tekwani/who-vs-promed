Wisconsin: Teenager Diagnosed With Rabies
-----------------------------------------
A teenager has been diagnosed as having a rare case of human rabies, only
the 2nd case in Wisconsin in nearly 50 years, health officials said on Wed
20 Oct 2004. Only 3 people in the world are known to have survived after
the onset of rabies symptoms, said Jim Kazmierczak, Wisconsin's state
public health veterinarian. Nearly all patients die within a few weeks of
developing symptoms. Kazmierczak said the Fond du Lac County teen was
bitten by a bat in September 2004 but did not seek treatment.
Rabies can be prevented with a vaccine after initial exposure, but health
officials can do little for victims once symptoms set in. The bat bite was
"a minor exposure that was deemed as insignificant," Kazmierczak said.
"It's tragic."
Health officials refused to provide the teen's identity or condition.
Kazmierczak said the patient started having symptoms 13 Oct 2004 and was
hospitalized 15 Oct 2004. A lab test performed by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta confirmed Tuesday the boy has rabies.
Kazmierczak said the earliest symptoms often are tingling or numbness in
the limb or area where there was a bite, followed by a lack of
coordination, agitation, headache, hallucinations and seizures. Eventually,
the patient goes into a coma and dies. The CDC said most people do not show
symptoms of the disease until one to 3 months after being infected with the
virus. The last 2 human rabies cases in Wisconsin were in 2000 and 1959,
Kazmierczak said.
In Wisconsin, skunks and bats are the most likely animal species to carry
the rabies virus, although dogs, cats, raccoons, foxes and livestock also
have been infected in the past several years, according to the Department
of Health and Family Services.
Although human-to-human transmission is rare, state health officials were
working with the Fond du Lac County Health Department and local health care
providers to assess the any possible risks to people who came in contact
with the teenager.
The preventive treatment for rabies is a one-time injection of rabies
immune globulin that contains antibodies against the virus, followed by 5
doses of rabies vaccines injected into the arm in the next 28 days.

[This is indeed a tragic case. This incident indicates a continuing need to
make the general public aware that the majority of human cases of rabies in
the United States are contracted from rabies-infected bats. These animals
only rarely exhibit overt symptoms of infection.
The following is an extract from a previous ProMED-mail post (Rabies, human
- USA: MMWR reports 20001218.2215).
"In the United States since 1990, 24 (74 percent) of the 32 cases since
1990 have been attributed to bat-associated variants of rabies virus,
although a history of a bite was established in only 2 cases. Contact with
bats occurred in approximately half of the other cases. These cases
represent various bat-contact histories: a bat bite, direct contact with
bats with multiple opportunities to be bitten, and possible direct contact
with a bat. Canine rabies is prevalent in Africa, Asia, and Latin
America. Worldwide estimates of human rabies deaths exceed 50 000 cases
each year, and >95 percent of reported cases occur in regions where canine
rabies is endemic.
Although rabies is usually transmitted by a bite, persons may minimize the
medical implications of a bat bite. Unlike bites from larger animals, the
trauma of a bat bite is unlikely to warrant seeking medical care. Unless
the potential for rabies exposure is known to the patient, rabies
post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) will not be received. Although bat rabies
virus variants can be transmitted secondarily from terrestrial mammals, the
lack of other animal-bite histories and the rarity of bat rabies virus
variants found in terrestrial mammals suggest that this means of
transmission is rare.
Persons who are bitten or scratched by any animal should wash wounds
thoroughly and seek immediate medical attention to evaluate the need for
PEP. In all cases where bat-human contact has occurred or is suspected,
the bat should be collected and tested for rabies. If the bat is
unavailable, the need for PEP should be assessed by public health
officials. PEP should be considered after direct contact between a human
and a bat, unless the exposed person can be certain a bite, scratch, or
mucous membrane exposure did not occur. PEP may be considered for persons
who were in the same room as a bat and who might be unaware that a bite or
direct contact had occurred (e.g., when a sleeping person wakes to find a
bat in the room or an adult witnesses a bat in the room with an unattended
child, mentally disabled person, or intoxicated person). PEP is not
warranted when direct contact between a human and a bat did not
occur. Seeing a bat or being in the vicinity of bats does not constitute
an exposure."
