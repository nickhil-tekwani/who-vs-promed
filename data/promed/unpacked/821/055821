Thousands of chickens are dying of an unknown virus in many farms of Dumuria sub district [Khulna Division]. Due to sudden death of the chickens, the farm owners are facing serious economic loss.

On the other hand some illegal traders are selling sick poultry at lower prices in different markets and restaurants. Local unemployed youth people started a poultry farm a few months ago. It has caused huge financial losses of local farmers in last 2 months. They are trying to prevent and control the devastating disease with help of local livestock office. The local government office and livestock office have taken necessary steps to prevent unknown disease and prohibit the sale of sick poultry in local markets.

[Though mass mortality in poultry, in a country like Bangladesh where HPAI H5N1 is active since 2007 (547 officially notified outbreaks accumulated as of 5 Feb 2013), other possible causes (infectious as well as non-infectious) cannot be excluded prior to lab investigation. Results will be appreciated. - Mod.AS
