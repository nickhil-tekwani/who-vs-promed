Lakeside Foods, Inc. of Manitowoc, WI, is initiating a voluntary
recall of 15 000 cases of 14.5 ounce French Style Green Beans because
some cans may have been underprocessed and some cans may have leaked.
While no illnesses have been reported these cans have the potential
to be contaminated with harmful organisms including _Clostridium
botulinum_. No botulinum toxin has been found in any cans tested to
date, however the company continues to test out of an abundance of
caution. Consumers also are warned not to use the product even if it
does not look or smelled spoiled.
Lakeside is asking consumers who have cans of the French Style Green
Beans with the following in the top line of the can code to return
them unopened to the place of purchase. EAA5247, EAA5257, EAA267,
EAA5277, EAB5247, EAB5257, ECA5207, ECA5217, ECA5227, ECA5297,
ECB5207, ECAB5217, ECB5227 and ECB5307.
The product was distributed in the following 20 states AL, AZ CO, FL,
GA, IL, IN, KS, KY, MI, MO, MS, NC, NY, OH, OK, TN, TX, VA, WI and
Canada. The product was sold with the following labels:
Albertson's, Happy Harvest, Best Choice, Food Club, Bogopa, Valu
Time, Hill Country Fare, Heb, Laura Lynn, Kroger, No Name, North
Pride, Schnucks, Shop N Save, Shoppers Valu, Cub Foods, Dierbergs,
Flavorite, IGA, Best Choice and Thrifty Maid.
Lakeside Foods voluntarily recalled the products after learning of a
potential problem during routine internal monitoring. Lakeside said
it is working closely with the FDA and has identified and corrected
the condition that resulted in its decision to voluntarily recall the
cans in question. No other Lakeside products are affected by this recall.
Consumers with questions may contact the company at 1-800-466-3834
Ext. 4090. Code and label information will also be posted on their website

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts
such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases
associated with the food. This recall is unrelated to the ongoing
canned food botulism outbreak - Mod.LL]
