The number of people made ill by food sold in vending machines located in Moscow office buildings belonging to the Healthy Food company has risen to 65, with 17 people remaining in hospitals, the press service of the Moscow department of the Federal Service for the Oversight of Consumer Protection and Welfare informed TASS.

"Currently, there are 65 recorded cases of food poisoning [earlier reports have documented salmonellosis as the cause. - Mod.LL]. The number is increasing due to people who had eaten the food earlier only going to the doctor now, so it is doubtful that the number of people hospitalized will rise. Currently, 17 people remain in hospitals," the agency's source stated. Currently, the company's production hall located in south east Moscow is sealed, along with 48 vending machines and 2 cafes, the source added.

Reports of a mass food poisoning of Moscow office workers from vending machine snacks came to light on 16 Jul 2019. About 3 tons of products have been seized. Experts of the Russian Federal Service for the Oversight of Consumer Protection and Welfare have discovered expired products, unmarked produce, as well as food and products with fake expiration dates, in the company's production hall.

Earlier, a spokesperson for the company Valentina Chyornykh said on air of the Govorit Moskva radio station that the company had suspended all production and that it is currently carrying out a large-scale internal investigation with the aid of independent experts.
