This item tempts the imagination as to the cause of the reported mortality.
Often, actual mortality levels are not accurately measured. Clearly,
however, if the oyster growers feel the pain as severely as reported, there
is something wrong. Oyster mortalities of a scale up to 50% losses of
standing crops within a few months are actually not that uncommon. Since
the culture of most oysters for edible product is extensive rather than
intensive, substantive losses are common, they are expected and generally
poorly quantified. This can be frustrating to those of use who study these
diseases and long for quantitative documentation and precise answers.
It would be very interesting to review the facts available in this case.
The description as reported is not particularly precise. Researchers and
fishery managers sometimes (actually often) report infectious disease
causes when there is really only a hypothesis with limited data support an
infectious etiology. While this certainly could have an infectious
component, as there is some history in New South Wales of "winter disease"
caused by a protistan parasite, there certainly could be non-infectious
factors. It can be quite difficult in extensive populations to sort the
various factors out.
There are some very fine shellfish pathologists in Australia and hopefully
one or more of them will have an opportunity to evaluate this situation
(soon please, before the condition abates and the primarily evidence is
gone).
