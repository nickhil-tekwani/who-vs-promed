I saw the "Antibiotic resistance, gonococci - UK (Scotland)" posting from
11 Dec 2000 and noticed that previous USA postings were from 1998. The
MMWR from 22 Sept 2000 (see:
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4937al.htm>) [indicates that
9.5% of gonococcal strains in Hawaii were ciprofloxacin-resistant in 1999
and that endemic transmission (not simply importation) appears to be
occurring in that state. Additionally, the emergence of a cluster of
gonococcal isolates with high MICs to azithromycin has been identified in
Kansas City, Missouri.
Below is a brief summary of the MMWR.

Studies Show Gonorrhea Control Again Facing Challenge of Antibiotic Resistance
-------------------------------------
As drug-resistant strains of gonorrhea continue to emerge, successful
treatment of this sexually-transmitted disease (STD) is becoming more
difficult. In the 1980s, gonorrhea became resistant to penicillin and
tetracycline, rendering these drugs ineffective for gonorrhea. As a
result, since 1989 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has
recommended fluoroquinolone antibiotics -- such as ciprofloxacin -- as
treatment for gonorrhea. According to a new report in the 22 Sept issue of
CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, increased levels of
fluoroquinolone-resistant gonorrhea now are being reported in Hawaii,
increasing from 1.4% of strains tested in 1997 to 9.5% in 1999.
Consequently, CDC recommends that health care providers ask patients with
gonorrhea if they or their sex partners could have acquired the disease in
Hawaii, other Pacific Islands, or Asia, where fluoroquinolone-resistant
gonorrhea is common. If so, patients should be treated with cefixime or
ceftriaxone, which are other drugs that are currently recommended for
treating gonorrhea, and to which no resistance has been reported.
In addition, CDC is seeing the first indication that gonorrhea may be
becoming resistant to yet another drug. The first reported cluster of
patients -- 12 people -- with gonorrhea with decreased susceptibility to
azithromycin, another commonly used antibiotic, was found in Kansas City,
Missouri in 1999.
The resistance in Hawaii and Missouri were discovered through the
Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project (GISP), a CDC-sponsored
surveillance system, which monitors drug resistance of gonorrhea.
Throughout the United States, 26 sexually-transmitted disease
clinics participate in GISP by collecting gonorrhea cultures and submitting
them to one of 5 regional GISP laboratories for antimicrobial
susceptibility testing.
In view of these findings from GISP, if an antibiotic fails to treat a
patient infected with gonorrhea successfully, health care providers are
urged to submit patient specimens to their local laboratories for
drug-resistance testing.
If not treated successfully, gonorrhea can cause pelvic inflammatory
disease (PID), infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic
pain. Previous studies also have shown that gonorrhea can facilitate HIV
transmission. The estimated direct medical cost of treating gonorrhea in
the United States is $56 million each year. Gonorrhea is the second most
common disease reported to CDC, with more than 360 000 cases reported in
1999.
