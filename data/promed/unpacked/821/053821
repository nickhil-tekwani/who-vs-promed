Australian health authorities have reported an additional human fatality due to the mosquito-borne virus Japanese encephalitis.

On 4 May [2022], officials reported a death in Queensland. This is in addition to fatalities previously reported in New South Wales, South Australia, and Victoria.

Currently, 38 human cases of Japanese encephalitis have been reported in Australia this year [2022].

On 4 Mar 2022, Australia's Acting Chief Medical Officer, Dr Sonya Bennett, declared the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) situation a communicable disease incident of national significance.

According to health officials, most Japanese encephalitis virus infections in people are asymptomatic; however, those with severe infection (which occurs in less than 1% of cases) may experience neck stiffness, coma, and more rarely, permanent neurological complications or death.

Encephalitis is the most serious clinical consequence of infection. Illness usually begins with symptoms such as sudden onset of fever, headache, and vomiting. Anyone experiencing these symptoms should seek urgent medical attention.

People should try to prevent mosquito bites by using mosquito repellent containing picaridin, DEET, or oil of lemon eucalyptus on all exposed skin and reapply every few hours.

Wear long, light-colored, and loose-fitting clothing as well as covered footwear when outside. Ensure accommodation, including tents, are properly fitted with mosquito nettings or screens.

[Australia reports it 4th Japanese encephalitis (JE) fatality. Infections in piggeries continues, and with it the risk of human infections. Because vaccination against JE has been limited to areas of higher JE risk (localities where infected pigs have been found), avoidance of mosquito bites as recommended in the above report is the only practical prevention measure generally available. With the onset of cooler weather, mosquito activity should be declining and with it the risk of additional JE virus infections. - Mod.TY
