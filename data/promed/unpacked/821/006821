Date of start of the outbreak: 24 Jul 2017
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Cattle / 137 / 4 / 0 / 0 / 21
Affected population: during routine prophylaxis controls, 4 positive bovines were identified via intra-dermal tuberculin skin test plus 17 bovines which, in accordance with Council Directive 64/432 were considered positive and sent for slaughter since they had an inconclusive reaction for the second time.
Outbreak statistics (rates apparent; in percentages)
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Cattle / 2.92 / 0 / 0 / 15.33
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: all farms are regularly tested in Malta and stringent controls on animal movements are applied. Hence Malta has prohibited, in accordance with internal standard operating procedures, movement towards and from other farms and only permitted movement of animals for slaughter purposes. When this has happened, a thorough examination of the carcass and of the offal has been carried out. After the outbreak, no lesions have been detected on the inconclusive cases and on the slaughtered animals.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country, surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone, surveillance within containment and/or protection zone, traceability, disinfection, slaughter, ante and post-mortem inspections, vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists), no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type: Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale Della Lombardia e Dell' Emilia Romagna/Brescia (foreign laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Cattle / histopathological examination / 3 Nov 2017 / Positive

["Bovine tuberculosis is a chronic bacterial disease of cattle that occasionally affects other species of mammals. This disease is a significant zoonosis that can spread to humans, typically by the inhalation of aerosols or the ingestion of unpasteurized milk. In developed countries, eradication programs have reduced or eliminated tuberculosis in cattle and human disease is now rare; however, reservoirs in wildlife can make complete eradication difficult. Bovine tuberculosis is still common in less developed countries, and severe economic losses can occur from livestock deaths, chronic disease, and trade restrictions. In some situations, this disease may also be a serious threat to endangered species." (http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/bovine_tuberculosis.pdf)
