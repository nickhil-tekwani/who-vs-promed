I just read your question in the fsnet listserv pertaining to the _Shigella_
outbreak in our county. The serotype was _Shigella flexneri_ of which we have
few cases of each year in this county. We had approximately 50 people that we
know of who ate at this restaurant 6/29 or 6/30 and became ill. Approximately
10 have tested positive for this specific _Shigella_ species, one of which
[was
the cook. We have had 2 secondary cases but think we now have the outbreak
under control.
The Lake County Health Dept. lab did the stool cultures and forwarded them on
to the Illinois Dept. of Public Health Lab for confirmation. Staff who
conducted
the investigation consisted of sanitarian, nurse and an epidemiologist.

[The first posting of this thread (cited above) suggested that the strain
isolated was more common in Mexico than in the USA, but did not identify
the organism. This report provides reasonable closure, so the thread is
cut. - Mod.ES
