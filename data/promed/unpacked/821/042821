Subject: MMWR Article on EIP pathogen survey in the US
Excerpted from: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report,
Vol. 46 (12):258-61, March 28, 1997:
"Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network, 1996
"As an important strategy for addressing emerging infections in the
United States, in 1994 CDC began implementing Emerging Infections
Programs (EIPs) in state health departments, in collaboration with
local health departments, academic institutions, and organizations
of health professionals ...
"The objectives of FoodNet are to 1) determine more precisely the burden of
foodborne diseases in the United States, 2) determine the proportion of
specific foodborne diseases associated with certain contaminated foods or
with other exposures, and 3) provide the framework to respond rapidly and
collaboratively to emerging foodborne diseases. This report summarizes
preliminary results from FoodNet for 1996, which document regional and
seasonal differences in the incidences of certain bacterial foodborne
diseases, and presents findings of the 1995 baseline survey of clinical
laboratories, which suggests that, for some pathogens, factors other than
differing laboratory practices accounted for regional variations in
incidences.
"Active Surveillance
"On January 1, 1996, FoodNet began collecting population-based
active surveillance data on culture-confirmed cases of seven
potentially foodborne diseases ( Campylobacter, Escherichia
coli O157:H7, Listeria, Salmonella, Shigella, Vibrio, and Yersinia
infections) among the 13.2 million residents in five EIP sites* ...
"*Minnesota, Oregon, and selected counties in California (Alameda
and San Francisco), Connecticut (Hartford and New Haven), and
Georgia (Clayton, Cobb, DeKalb, Douglas, Fulton, Gwinnett, Newton,
and Rockdale).
"In 1996, a total of 7223 culture-confirmed cases of the seven foodborne
diseases were identified from stool specimens or specimens from
normally sterile sites. Incidence rates were highest for
campylobacteriosis (25 per 100,000 population), followed by
salmonellosis (16), shigellosis (9), E. coli O157:H7 infection
(3), Yersinia infection (1), listeriosis (0.5), and vibriosis (0.2). For
all the diseases except salmonellosis, rates varied substantially
among the EIP sites (Figure 1) [see MMWR: RAL]. Rates for
campylobacteriosis ranged from 14 (Georgia) to 58 (California); for
shigellosis, from 4 (Minnesota) to 20 (Georgia); for E. coli O157:H7
infection, from 0.6 (Georgia) to 5 (Minnesota); for Yersinia infection,
from 0.5 (California) to 3 (Georgia); and for vibriosis, from 0.1
(Connecticut, Minnesota, and Oregon) to 0.3 (California). Rates also varied
by age: for example, among children aged <1 year, the rate for
salmonellosis ranged from 73 (Connecticut) to 270 (Georgia) and,
for campylobacteriosis, ranged from 25 (Georgia) to 193 (California) ...
"Isolation patterns varied by season for several pathogens: 50%
of E. coli O157:H7, 35% of Campylobacter, and 33% of Salmonella
were isolated during summer months (June-August). The percentage
of pathogens isolated from normally sterile sites (e.g., blood and
cerebrospinal fluid) was 89% for Listeria, 10% for Vibrio, 9% for
Salmonella, 3% for Yersinia, and 1% each for Shigella and
Campylobacter. Of the 7223 case-patients, 1174 (16%) were
hospitalized; hospitalization rates were highest for persons with
listeriosis (94%), followed by those with Yersinia infection (32%),
E. coli O157:H7 infection (28%), salmonellosis (22%), vibriosis (20%),
shigellosis (14%), and campylobacteriosis (10%). Of the 34 deaths,
16 (47%) were associated with salmonellosis; nine (26%), with
listeriosis; four (12%), with campylobacteriosis; two (6%), with E.
coli O157:H7 infection; two (6%), with shigellosis; and one (3%),
with vibriosis.
"Laboratory Survey
"To assess variations in laboratory culturing practices, in late 1995
FoodNet investigators mailed a questionnaire to the microbiology
supervisor at each of the 234 clinical laboratories that tested stool
specimens for infectious agents in the EIP sites. The 230 responding
laboratories performed approximately 22,000 bacterial stool cultures
in August 1995.
"Responding laboratories reported that all stool specimens submitted
for bacterial culture were tested for Salmonella and Shigella, and
approximately 99% of specimens were tested for Campylobacter.
Culturing practices for Vibrio, Yersinia, and E. coli O157:H7 varied
substantially among laboratories surveyed. Overall, 20% (range:
9%-43%) of stool specimens were tested routinely for Vibrio; 34%
(range: 13%-52%), for Yersinia; and 47% (range: 6%-82%), for E.
coli O157:H7. Overall, 80% (range: 58%-99%) of all bloody stool
specimens submitted to these laboratories were tested for E. coli
O157:H7."
----------------
As expected, the results shown strong increases in summer months, presumed
to be due to biological activity increases on the part of pathogens and
humans, and the increased promiscuity of social interactions (swimming
pools, community meals, social events, etc.).
It is also interesting to compare the occurrence of certain pathogens in
the human population in the US versus other countries and other species.
For example, the reported E. coli O157:H7 rate of 3:100,000 is far below
the rates of 1-3% measured in Osaka and Scotland in recent outbreaks, and
also well below the recently reported animal carrier rates of 1-2% in
cattle and up to 3% in seagulls.
Also note that ~ 90% of Listeria monocytogenes positives were in body
fluids (blood, spinal).
