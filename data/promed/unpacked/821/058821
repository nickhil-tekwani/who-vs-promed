About 250 pigs have died from a mysterious disease having hit parts of the
Southern Province of Zambia, a veterinary officer said on Tuesday.
The disease broke out 3 weeks ago, according to veterinary officer Panel
Nyimba.
People in the affected areas have been advised to stop eating pork, since
veterinary officers do not yet know the cause of the disease or the
possible effects on humans [if the meat] is consumed, Nyimba said.
Farmers have also been advised not to allow their livestock to wander
around freely.
