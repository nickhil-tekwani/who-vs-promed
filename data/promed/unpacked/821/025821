[2] CIDRAP report
Date: 19 Aug 2015
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2015/08/who-reports-3-new-ebola-cases-all-guinea


The number of newly confirmed Ebola infections in West Africa's outbreak region stayed at 3 last week for the 2nd straight week, with Guinea the only country to report new cases, the World Health Organization (WHO) said today [19 Aug 2015] in its weekly snapshot of the epidemic.

Earlier this week, the WHO announced that Sierra Leone had gone a full week without reporting a new case, the 1st time since the outbreak began last year [2014]. However, in reporting further progress against the virus, the WHO also warned of a significant risk of transmission, because some contacts have been lost to follow-up in Guinea and in Freetown, Sierra Leone's capital.

In a related development, the WHO recently announced that a committee set up to review how the International Health Regulations (IHRs) performed during the Ebola outbreak will meet for the 1st time on 24 Aug [2015].

All of Guinea's 3 Ebola cases were among registered contacts, and the patients are all receiving care in Ebola treatment centers, according to the WHO. The high percentage of detections in known contacts is an encouraging sign that surveillance activities have identified ongoing transmission chains. ... -more

http://allafrica.com/stories/201508191008.html
[The Mano River Union Secretariat has warned that the border closure between Liberia, Guinea and the Ivory Coast is worrisome because it undermines regional integration, trade, peace and security as well as impedes efforts to conduct rigorous surveillance for Ebola virus disease [EVD] outbreaks across borders.

23 Aug 2015 Liberia [Partnership for Research on Ebola Vaccines in Liberia (PREVAIL)]: With many Ebola survivors ailing, doctors evaluate situation
http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/A/AF_EBOLA_SICK_SURVIVORS?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2015-08-23-09-07-14
[Lingering health problems afflicting many of the roughly 13 000 Ebola survivors have galvanized global and local health officials to find out how widespread the ailments are, and how to remedy them. The World Health Organization calls it an emergency within an emergency. Many of the survivors have vision and hearing issues. Others experience physical and emotional pains, fatigue and other problems.

"If we can find out this kind of information, hopefully we can help other Ebola survivors in the future," Dr. Zan Yeong, an eye specialist involved in a study of health problems in survivors in Liberia, told The Associated Press. About 7500 people will enroll -- 1500 Ebola survivors and 6000 of their close contacts -- and will be monitored over a 5-year period in the study launched by Partnership for Research on Ebola Vaccines in Liberia, or PREVAIL. ...more]

According to Conteh, staff of funeral homes will be incorporated into the existing burial teams to ensure compliance and successful implementation of the amended policy, while the Connaught Hospital mortuary will operate as storage for repatriated and medico-legal corpses, subject to the directives from the Chief Medical Officer and the pathologist. Conteh also said families in the Western Area will be offered the chance to negotiate safe and dignified burials at a cemetery of their choice within the Western Area only, and that it will cost SLL 25 000 [USD 5.38]. ...more]

http://www.ifrc.org/en/news-and-media/news-stories/africa/liberia/using-real-time-data-to-improve-emergency-response-68958/
[The Ebola outbreak in West Africa has been no exception in terms of logistical challenges, but it has nevertheless proven to be an opportunity for the Red Cross to pioneer an efficient method of data collection: Rapid Mobile Phone Based surveys, or RAMP. Combining this innovation with Red Cross's beneficiary communications approach -- dialogue with affected communities -- enabled Red Cross teams to rapidly inform and evaluate programming in the critical 1st days. ...more]

["ABC: avoid body contact," "No touch" and "Ebola is real" became mantras to chant and print across Sierra Leone as the country continues to battle the unprecedented Ebola outbreak. Catchy and simple, communities have latched onto these snappy sayings and, for the most part, live by them. Education through social mobilization led to behavior change. Case rates tumbled.

Over 3000 Red Cross volunteers engaged in the Ebola emergency response have been central to binding communities to the words that will protect them from Ebola. The Sierra Leone Red Cross Society [SLRCS] and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) have carried out psychosocial support, contact tracing, safe and dignified burials, case management and social mobilization in Ebola affected communities. All 5 interventions have contributed to reigning in the outbreak. But it is dangerous to think that Ebola is over. Complacency is as dangerous as the Ebola virus itself. ...more]

20 Aug 2015: Coal giant exploited Ebola crisis for corporate gain, say health experts
http://www.dailynews.lk/?q=features/coal-giant-exploited-ebola-crisis-corporate-gain-say-health-experts#sthash.cTffrvqc.dpuf
[Public health experts outraged after the world's largest privately-held coal company, Peabody Energy, promotes its product in the fight against Ebola in Africa as part of a PR campaign to rebrand the fossil fuel as a solution to global poverty. Public health experts involved in the response to the Ebola crisis have condemned what they described as a ludicrous, insulting and opportunistic attempt to exploit the disease for corporate gain by the world's largest privately-held coal company. As part of a PR offensive to rebrand coal as a "21st-century fuel" that can help solve global poverty, it has emerged that at the height of Ebola's impact in Africa, Peabody Energy promoted its product as an answer to Africa's devastating public health crisis.

Greg Boyce, the chief executive of Peabody, a US-based multinational with mining interests around the world, included a slide on Ebola and energy in a presentation to a coal industry conference in September last year [2014]. The slide suggested that more energy would have spurred the distribution of a hypothetical Ebola vaccine, citing as supporting evidence a University of Pennsylvania infectious disease expert. The World Health Organisation believes nearly 27 000 people contracted Ebola in an outbreak of the virus in West Africa last year [2014], and more than 11 000 died, although the international agency believes that is probably an underestimate. ...more]

20 Aug 2015: Protecting the most vulnerable in Sierra Leone's latest Ebola outbreak
http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/david-bull/sierra-leone-ebola_b_8010444.html
[The 49 households that make up [the village of] Massesebe were under lockdown after a man who had traveled to the village from Freetown for the Eid [a religious holiday at the end of Ramadan fasting] celebrations died of Ebola. This was the 1st Ebola case in Tonkolili District in 5 months. 498 people, including 101 children under 5, were quarantined in the village, and 2 people were confirmed as being Ebola positive.

Because of the vulnerability of newborns, and the concern for well-intentioned people touching the newborn baby and mother after delivery, R and her husband M spoke with a team of UNICEF (United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund) supported psychosocial counselors. The parents agreed that mother and child should move to the nearby Observational Interim Care Center where children are cared for in a child-friendly environment by trained Ebola survivors who do not run the risk of contracting or transmitting the virus. ...more]

[According to Sierra Leone officials, on Sat [22 Aug 2015], gold exports plunged 3-fold, and diamond exports nearly halved in the 1st half of 2015, a sign of the devastation of the mining industry by the Ebola epidemic. Diamond exports dropped from a high of 64 500 carats in April 2015 to 35 600 carats in July 2015. ...more]
