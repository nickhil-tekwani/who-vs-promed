STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS, VANCOMYCIN RESISTANCE? - JAPAN (02)
==========================================================

From: Dr Iain Gosbell <i.gosbell@unsw.edu.au>
Subject: Vancomycin resistant Staphylococcus aureus
There was a report of an outbreak in 6 Japanese hospitals of
vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus - "VRSA". This was shown on the
Australian Broadcasting Corporation programme "Lateline" which was screened
on Channel 2 in NSW on 10.30pm EST on 21/5/97. Apparently there is a letter
in the next issue of the Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy in which
these cases are described. This is of major interest if it is true, and it
seems likely to be true. According to the programme, the organisms are
"resistant to all known antibiotics".
It would be interesting to have this verified, and also to find out what the
mechanism of resistance is, ie., is it the same as in VRE or is it a novel
mechanism.
