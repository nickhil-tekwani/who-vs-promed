[1] USA ex Sierra Leone case

An American clinician infected with Ebola while working with the aid group Partners in Health in Sierra Leone was evacuated on Fri [13 Mar 2015] to the National Institutes of Health clinical center in Bethesda, MD, as new details emerged that suggested the patient may have exposed some colleagues to the virus.

Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, would not identify the patient to protect his privacy. "His condition is unfortunately serious, but this is a serious disease, and hopefully over the next days we can turn him around," Dr. Fauci said by telephone, after having just left the patient's room. "We're going to do everything in our power to try to get him well," he said. "We have a responsibility when an American gets infected to take care of them and bring them back to their homeland, and that's what we did here."

Several health workers in Sierra Leone said the American had felt dizzy and collapsed while working at a hospital in the Port Loko district. He tested positive for Ebola on Tues [10 Mar 2015]. Colleagues helped him up, and they are now considered contacts who may be infected. None have tested positive for Ebola. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Friday that plans were being made to bring several Americans who may have been exposed to him to the United States for monitoring and isolation.

"It's hard for me to understand what else you can do if one of your colleagues or patients collapses," said Dr. Paul Farmer, a Harvard professor of medicine who is a co-founder of Partners in Health. "You take care of people as with every other illness that's communicable, and you're exposed. I would be deeply disappointed if those are exposures that result in another case."

Whether the man was infected in the group's Ebola treatment unit, where he was training in the high-risk zone, or in the government hospital, where Partners in Health supports the resumption of health care services, was unknown. Ebola was diagnosed on Fri [13 Mar 2015] in a Sierra Leonean working at the same hospital, but officials said the cases appeared unrelated.

[Partners in Health is a nonprofit group with 2000 staff in West Africa, including foreigners and locals and 600 Ebola survivors. The group began treating Ebola patients in Liberia and Sierra Leone in November 2014, and the health care worker who tested positive for Ebola on 11 Mar 2015 is the 1st staff member to fall ill "as a result of a confirmed occupational exposure," the group said. The group is working with the CDC, the WHO, and the Ministry of Health and Sanitation of Sierra Leone to conduct a thorough assessment of safety and clinical protocols to ensure that they continue providing the best possible care for their patients, and safe workplaces for their staff. - Mod.LK]

The 1st of a group of 10 American aid workers who may have come into contact with the Ebola virus in Sierra Leone were evacuated on Sat [14 Mar 2015], American government and aid officials said. They will be the largest group of Americans to have returned home over fears of exposure to the virus since an outbreak in 3 West African countries was declared last year [2014].

The 10 worked with the American charity Partners in Health and were determined to have varying degrees of risk but no symptoms, said Sheila Davis, who leads Ebola response efforts for the group, which she said would continue working in Sierra Leone. A medical worker for the charity was confirmed to have Ebola last week and returned to the United States on Fri [13 Mar 2015].

The infected medical worker received a shot of an experimental Ebola vaccine in Sierra Leone.

Another worker with the group, who had shown signs of illness, arrived in the United States on Fri [13 Mar 2015] evening. She tested negative for Ebola twice, said several officials unaffiliated with the charity, speaking on the condition of anonymity. She was sent to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, which has a specialized unit for Ebola patients. The hospital had no information to provide on the patient, an Emory spokeswoman said.

Officials said the evacuation might expand if necessary. The illness has killed an estimated 10 000 people in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, the 3 countries most affected, but only a small number of foreign aid workers have been infected, many of whom have received sophisticated critical care in Western countries and survived.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced on Sat [14 Mar 2015] that the Americans who came into contact with him or might have had exposures similar to those that resulted in his infection would be taken into voluntary isolation close to 3 hospitals capable of treating Ebola patients: the University of Nebraska Medical Center, the National Institutes of Health center in Bethesda and Emory University Hospital.

Dr. Peter George, director of the Sierra Leone hospital where some of the workers were volunteering, said by phone on Sat [14 Mar 2015] that an investigation was focusing on the possibility that the clinician had been exposed to Ebola while removing protective clothing on his way out of the high-risk zone at an Ebola treatment unit supported by Partners in Health near the hospital.

[Partners in Health said the Americans are being evacuated and quarantined out of an abundance of caution. The 10 health care workers represent the largest group to be evacuated to the United States over possible Ebola exposure. This will allow easy access to rapid testing and treatment in the unlikely instance that any one of them becomes symptomatic. - Mod.LK]
