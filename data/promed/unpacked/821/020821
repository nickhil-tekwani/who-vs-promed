A dengue fever epidemic is ravaging Paraguay, where more than 10 000
people have fallen ill.
The newspaper ABC-Color Friday [23 Feb 2007] reported 650 new cases
of the illness, which produces symptoms including bad headaches, high
fever, diarrhea, vomiting and severe joint pain.
At least 4 people have died from the virus, against which there is no
vaccine or medication.
The Paraguayan Congress is poised to declare a 60-day state of
emergency that will allow it to adopt measures to combat the epidemic.
A bill to establish the state of emergency has been approved
unanimously by the lower house of the legislature, and the Senate is
scheduled to debate it on Monday [26 Feb 2007].
In the meantime, critics ... claim that deficient sanitation and
open-air garbage dumps have provided ideal conditions for the insects
that transmit the virus to reproduce.
Unofficial estimates [of dengue cases are] as high as 60 000.

[ProMED requests information about the numbers of dengue and DHF
cases that have occurred so far in this epidemic and the progress
being made to eliminate the breeding sites of the mosquito vector,
_Aedes aegypti_. If the unofficial figure cited above is correct, the
Paraguay health authorities have an immense job ahead of them to
bring the epidemic under control. The report posted in the last
Dengue DHF update on 19 Feb 2007 (archive no. 20070219.0630) from the
Pan American Health Organization jointly with the Paraguay Ministry
of Health indicated that a vigorous campaign was being launched to
control the disease. ProMED thanks A-Lan Banks for an earlier report
of dengue in Paraguay.

The total number of deaths from seasonal dengue fever in Indonesia
since January this year [2007] has reached 330 out of 23 000 infected
people, the Health Ministry said here on Tuesday [20 Feb 2007].
Head of the Sub Directorate of Arbovirosis in the ministry Rita
Kriastuti said that the death figure from the disease has risen
sharply and that it could be curtailed through an implementation of
good hygiene and sanitation measures. "The number of cases could be
decreased by a good implementation of sanitation and hygiene," said Kriastuti.
The disease has attacked many provinces in the vast archipelago
country, such as Jakarta, West Java, Central Java, East Java and East
Kalimantan, the ministry said.
The health ministry has taken several measures to decrease the rate
of fatalities from the mosquito-borne disease, which spreads during
the rainy season, according the ministry.

[It would be of interest to know how recent flooding may have
affected the medical care of dengue patients and the abundance of
dengue virus vector mosquito breeding sites. ProMED thanks A-Lan

In Indramayu, West Java, the spread of dengue fever has intensified
in areas along the north coast, especially in Indramayu and Cirebon,
where patient numbers are on the increase. The Indramayu
administration has placed the area on high alert in an attempt to
minimize the spread of the mosquito-borne disease, while the Cirebon
administration planned to increase the number of facilities and
medical equipment to treat the dengue patients, whose numbers have
steadily swelled. Reports gathered Wednesday [21 Feb 2007] indicated
the number of dengue fever patients in Indramayu in February 2007 had
reached 138, twice as many compared to the corresponding month last
year [2006], in which there were only 60 patients. The number of
dengue fever patients in Cirebon reached 120, causing hospitals to
suffer bed and ward shortages.

WHO describes dengue fever as a severe, flu-like illness that affects
infants, young children, and adults but is seldom fatal. The clinical
features of dengue fever vary according to the age of the patient.
Infants and young children may have a non-specific febrile illness
with rash (although some infants and very young children may develop
shock syndrome, with sudden loss of circulating fluid volume, and
die). Older children and adults may have either a mild febrile
syndrome or the classical incapacitating disease, with abrupt onset
and high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and
joint pains, and rash.
Dengue hemorrhagic fever is a potentially deadly complication that is
characterized by high fever, hemorrhagic phenomena -- often with
enlargement of the liver -- and in severe cases, circulatory failure.
The illness commonly begins with a sudden rise in temperature
accompanied by facial flush and other non-specific constitutional
symptoms of dengue fever. The fever usually continues for 2 to 7 days
and can be as high as 40-41 C (104-105.8 F), possibly with febrile
convulsions and hemorrhagic phenomena. In moderate DHF cases, all
signs and symptoms abate after the fever subsides. In severe cases,
the patient's condition may suddenly deteriorate after a few days of
fever; the temperature drops, followed by signs of circulatory
failure, and the patient may rapidly go into a critical state of
shock and die within 12-24 hours or quickly recover following
appropriate volume replacement therapy. There is no specific
treatment for dengue fever. However, careful clinical management by
experienced physicians and nurses frequently saves the lives of DHF
patients. With appropriate intensive supportive therapy, mortality
may be reduced to less than one percent. Maintenance of the
circulating fluid volume is the central feature of DHF case
management. (Abstracted from the WHO website fact sheet on dengue:
