The median infectious dose (ID50) for _Shigella_ species that we have
examined appears to be around 1000 organisms, and the dose-response curve is
consistent with the beta-poisson model that we have developed. There appear
to have been outbreaks in which the average dose ingested was on the order of
10 organisms. See the following reference for details on this model (which I
know is being looked at as a possible template for VTEC):
"Prevalence of Shigellosis in the U.S.: Consistency with Dose-Response
Information", C. Crockett, C.N. Haas, A. Fazil, J.B. Rose, and C.P. Gerba,
International Journal of Food Microbiology, 30(1-2):87-100 (1996).

[Simon Elliot's message implies that VTEC's are rather common in the
environment and livestock are inevitably regularly exposed. Note that in a
country like the UK, with extensive rights of way across farmland and many
pet dogs, this extends to a very much greater number than just those working
directly with cattle. Indeed it would extend to most rural dwellers as well
as city dwellers who regularly walk in the countryside.
It will also be absurd that laboratories designed to handle pathogens
cannot handle VTEC's but the above mentioned groups do so regularly in an
uncontrolled manner. It is even more absurd when you consider that
establishments with facilities to perform animal studies probably have
VTEC's wild in their animal areas, let alone if they have an associated
farm surrounding the site.
The comment on funding is appropriate. It appears to have become common
practice in the UK for researchers to obtain funding by persuing a scare
campaign in the UK press. Personally I find this unethical. The stress (in
the UK) has been entirely on urban dwellers consuming meat products, and
those living in rural areas have been entirely ignored despite clearly
having a very much greater likelihood of exposure.
The increasing incidence of vegetables being responsible for the spread of
VTEC's outside the UK has singularly failed to enter the UK press which is
strange [The failure or the press? -- Mod CHC. Indeed, I have doubts that
the UK authorities are even aware that vegetables are a known carrier of
VTEC's.
I suspect your plea [to reassess the concept of infectious dose of VTEC and
how we communicate the dangers of this organism to the public and our funding
bodies will fall on deaf ears.

A couple of points raised by Dr Elliott deserve comment: His thesis in
favour of a high infectious dose of VTEC/SLTEC is not consistent with the
evidence. The Adelaide O111 epidemic showed that SLTEC O111 was present in
some samples of fermented sausage (mettwurst) in such small numbers that
immunomagnetic enrichment was required to show their presence. Probing
cultures of the incriminated mettwurst by PCR showed Stx sequences present in
7 of 16 samples and PCR for O111-specific sequences was positive in only 3 of
these. Isolates of SLTEC O111 were obtained in two of these three and in one
of the two & only after immunomagnetic bead enrichment.
There is now ample evidence of person-to-person transmission of EHEC in child
care settings (Belongia EA et al JAMA; 1993269: 883-888., Lerman Y etal. J

The VTEC organism is probably considered too dangerous by most scientists for
human challenge experiments. However, there are indirect measures of low
infectious doses for pathogens. I consider bacteria showing all of the
following:
- evidence for person to person spread
- evidence for waterborne transmission
- evidence for laboratory-acquired infections
to show most certainly a low infectious dose. All modes of transmission have
been described for E. coli O157.
Calculating observed attack rates vs. infectious dose in foodborne outbreaks
where estimates of CFU/g for the pathogen in food is available could be used
to calculate approximate ID-50 values without need for human volunteer
experiments.

In Switzerland, VTEC are indeed very prevalent in cattle (in the range of
30 % or more). However, none of over 300 strains isolated from cattle in
our lab so far belongs to the O157 serogroup. I am not aware of any
published work showing E. coli O157 to be very prevalent in cattle. It is
true that the clinical (and public health) significance of non-O157 remain
to be established, for individual patients as well as their possible
presence in food.
There are three reports (the one below plus Philips G and Old DC, J-Hosp-
Infect (1997) 35:72, and Rao GG et al., J-Hosp-Infect (1996) 33:228-30) in
the literature on laboratory-acquired infections with E. coli O157. The one
we reported (Burnens AP et al., Int-J-Med-Microbiol (1993) 279:512-517) did
not involve any unusual incident, however, the strain was used in a 'research
setting' which may involve more risks than exposure in a diagnostic
laboratory. Given the rarity of the pathogen in Switzerland (two strains
reported per year), the single case of an infected laboratory worker
nevertheless makes the infectiousness of the E. coli O157 look impressive.

Simon Elliott, in a recent posting on VTEC, states that "The theoretical
infectious dose for ANY organism is 1 but the infectious dose follows a
probability curve." The specific theory under which that holds was not
stated. I would think any such theory must be highly impropable. It
would have to hold that the reproduction number of an organism in a host
(the number of next generation organisms that each organism generates)
is independent of the number of other organisms in the environment
which can absorb immune response elements that could kill an organism.
The theoretical infectious dose should be that number of organisms where
the average reproduction number is able to sustain the organism density
in the original dose.

[As shown above, different opinions about the infectious dose of VTEC
organisms show the lack of consensus on this subject. Microbial risk
assessment is a relatively new area of study and has many unanswered
questions. However, further postings about infectious dose should be
directed to the original author or discussed elsewhere. Unless there is new
information pertinent to this list, this string is ended. -- Mod MDM
