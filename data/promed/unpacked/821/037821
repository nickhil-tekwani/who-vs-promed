Fungus wiping out tomato plants across Alberta
----------------------------------------------
A fast-spreading fungus is wiping out tomato plants across Alberta.
The airborne disease called late blight of potato [and tomato] -- the
same organism that led to the Irish Potato Famine -- is very rare in
Alberta, said forensic plant pathologist Ieuan Evans. However, a
"giant outbreak" of the disease is attacking tomato plants this
[2010] season and causing hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage,
he said.

"We've never had this strain in Alberta before -- it's a tomato
strain and it's extremely virulent," he said. "On the prairies, the
last time we had an outbreak of any consequence was 1993, but that
was a potato strain."

Thunderstorms quickly spread the spores. The disease is also
attacking tomatoes in Saskatchewan and Manitoba [see ProMED-mail post
20100712.2328].

Testing has shown some tomato seedlings sold in Edmonton were
contaminated with the fungus. Those plants were likely imported from
outdoor growing areas such as British Columbia. It's also possible
the disease built up in potatoes before it spread to tomatoes. "It
does not survive (winter) in Alberta on anything except stored
potatoes. Any one showing any lesion or injury, cut the lesion out
and eat the darn thing," said Evans.

[Late blight of tomato and potato is caused by the fungus-like
organism _Phytophthora infestans_ and can cause 100 percent crop
loss. The pathogen can affect leaves, stems, and fruit of tomato
causing spots, lesions, and rotting, and in potato it affects leaves
as well as tubers. The disease can spread rapidly within a crop and
destroy it within a few days. It is spread by contaminated plant and
other material, wind, and water. Under favourable conditions,
epidemics in tomatoes may be even more rapid than in potatoes.

Disease management requires an integrated approach and may include
phytosanitary measures, removal of pathogen reservoirs (solanaceous
weeds, volunteer crop plants), limiting free moisture in the crop,
preventative fungicide treatments of planting material (tomato
transplants, potato seed tubers), fungicide sprays of crops, and crop
rotation. Commercial crop cultivars vary in susceptibility to late
blight. Development of resistant cultivars is being counteracted by
the adaptability of the pathogen, with new strains evolving
frequently.

It is not clear from the report above whether this is a new pathogen
strain, or a previously know strain new to Alberta. Similar to what
is suspected in Alberta, an outbreak of late blight on tomato in the
USA in 2009 was also thought to have originated from infected tomato
seedlings distributed widely (ProMED-mail post 20090519.1875).
