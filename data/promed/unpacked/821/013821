A state public health lab in Montana has resolved the Costco _E. coli_ [O157] outbreak: it's the produce. Craig Wilson, assistant food safety chief for Costco, said the strain of _E. coli_ that caused the outbreak was found in an onion and celery mix that was used in chicken salad.

"This is wonderful news," Wilson told The Oregonian/OregonLive. "I can't tell you how often we don't find these things."

The onion and celery mix was made by Taylor Farms in Salinas, California. Costco also used other suppliers for the onion and celery mix but Wilson said they may have used the same ingredients that went into the packages from Taylor Farms.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the outbreak has sickened 19 people in 7 states: California (1), Colorado (4), Missouri (1), Montana (6), Utah (5), Virginia (1), and Washington (1). 5 people have been hospitalized, including 2 who suffered hemolytic-uremic syndrome, a type of kidney failure. It can lead to serious complications, including heart problems, stroke, and coma. Patients range in age from 5 to 84 years old.

Wilson said the lab is running further testing to determine whether the subtype of _E. coli_ O157:H7 in the mix matches the bug that sickened patients. Although 19 people were sickened, patients in California, Virginia, and Missouri may not be connected to the Costco's rotisserie chicken salad, Wilson said.

"They haven't confirmed that it's Costco," he said.

[First reported just 2 days ago, it was not likely that the chicken per se was the vehicle for the EHEC (enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_), unless cross-contamination occurred after cooking, as chicken as well as turkey are unusual primary sources of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ infections in humans. It now appears that another ingredient in the chicken salad, an onion and celery mix, is the vehicle although a formal genetic comparison is still forthcoming. ProMED-mail awaits more information regarding the scope of the ongoing outbreak. - Mod.LL
