Czech state veterinarians said on Friday [27 Mar 2009] they had found
a new case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in a 6-year-old
cow on a farm near the northern border with Poland.

Also known as mad cow disease, BSE first emerged in Britain in the
1980s and has been found in herds in several European and other
countries.

[Checking OIE WAHID (World Animal Health Information Database), the
Czech Republic reported 8 cases without clinical signs in 2005, 3
cases in 2006, 2 cases in 2007, none in 2008.

This 6-year-old cow was probably infected via contaminated calf feed
in 2002-2003. According to OIE's HandiSTATUS the reported incidence in
the Czech Republic from 1996 to 2000 was 0, 2 cases in 2001, 2 in
2002, 4 in 2003, and 7
in 2004. So unless they were importing contaminated meat and bone
meals in 2002-3, there were unrecognised cases being recycled at the
beginning of the decade in the Czech Republic. Readers are encouraged
