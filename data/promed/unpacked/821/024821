In La Plata, 3 people are hospitalized with [a] hantavirus [infection]. These [patients] include 2 men and a woman who are in different hospitals in La Plata, the capital of Buenos Aires province. A 30-year-old woman and a 32-year-old man are hospitalized in the Alejandro Korn provincial Hospital in Melchor Romero.

The young woman "is progressing favorably and will be released in coming hours," while the other patient is in intensive care, although his physicians predict that within the next 48 hours, he will be move to a general care ward.

The other [3rd] patient, a 35-year-old man, remains hospitalized in intensive care in the Hospital Italiano in La Plata with renal problems.

Hantaviruses are in the RNA group and are transmitted by infected rodents (zoonoses) and in humans generally produce 2 types of disease: a viral hemorrhagic fever, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, or hantavirus pulmonary syndrome [HPS], a very serious pulmonary disease.

[As indicated in the report above, there are 3 new cases of HPS (hantavirus pulmonary syndrome) in the La Plata area. However, one of these, the 35-year-old man, was previously reported as a suspected case in a 3 Dec 2014 ProMED-mail post (archive no. 20141208.3019688). The above report suggests that this case is now confirmed as HPS. Some HPS cases also have renal involvement.

There have been 2 previous fatal cases of HPS in Buenos Aires province this year (2014). The hantaviruses involved in these and previous cases are not identified, and ProMED would be interested in knowing whether a specific virus is laboratory identified.

Cases of hantavirus infections were reported from various parts of Argentina over the past 3 years (2012, 2013, and 2014). As noted in ProMED-mail archive no. 20110430.1348, several endemic hantaviruses have been associated with human infection in Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Lechiguana (in central Argentina in the yellow pygmy rice rat _O. flavescens_); Oran (in northwestern Argentina in _O. longicaudatus_); and Bermejo (western Argentina in _O. flavescens_). Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved in these 2014 Buenos Aires province cases. Andes virus seems unlikely in this case, but these cases in Buenos Aires province may have been caused by Lechiguana virus infection.

An image of the yellow pygmy rice rat, _O. flavescens_, the Lechiguana virus rodent reservoir, is available at http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_WrdzfKHDxmQ/SJ-E642S6MI/AAAAAAAABz4/DaDCHaFSDDE/s400/rato+dagua.jpg.
