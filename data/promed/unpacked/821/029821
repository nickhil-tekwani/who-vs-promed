MSF [Medecins Sans Frontieres] emergency teams are responding to the
1st ever dengue fever outbreak in Cape Verde, and the biggest in
Africa. The Cape Verde Ministry of Health has reported 13 187
suspected cases of dengue fever in 4 islands within the archipelago
between 1 Oct - 9 Nov [2009]. The outbreak is the 1st ever in Cape
Verde and is the biggest recorded in Africa. The number of cases has
increased sharply since the beginning of November 2009, reaching 1000
cases per day. 93 cases of DHF have been reported, and 6 people have
already died.

The international response to the dengue fever outbreak has been
positive, with public health experts and international medical teams
now providing medical support, case management, surveillance and diagnostics.

MSF has sent a team to support the hospital in Sao Filipe, the main
town on the island of Fogo, where between 100 and 150 new dengue
cases are being reported every day. Fogo has a population of around
40 000 people. More medical staff from MSF will arrive by the end of
the week [week of 15 Nov 2009] to support health centres in Cape
Verde's capital city Praia on Santiago Island.

"This is the 1st reported epidemic of dengue fever in Cape Verde, and
it is huge," says Dr Iza Ciglenecki, MSF's Emergency Coordinator in
Cape Verde. "With globalisation, dengue fever is appearing in places
where it has previously been unknown; it is the most rapidly
spreading mosquito born disease in the world."

Up to 10 cases of dengue fever, which is not common in Senegal, were
detected since October [2009] in various localities of the West
African country, newspapers published in the capital Dakar reported
on Tuesday [10 Nov 2009]. The Senegalese health authorities have
found 19 patients suspected of suffering from dengue fever, since the
disease was 1st detected in Louanga, professor Oumar Faye, the
director of the Health Ministry, told the privately-owned Le
Populaire newspaper. Doctor Malang Coly of the office of the World
Health Organization (WHO) in Dakar also confirmed the outbreak,
indicating that the 1st case was detected in a Senegalese residing in
Italy who recently came to Senegal for holiday. No deaths have been
reported, officials said, adding a campaign is in place to eliminate
mosquito breeding grounds.

The outbreak is the 1st in Senegal, which has reported no cases in
the past 2 decades. The dengue fever is spread by the mosquito and
has similar symptoms to malaria: headaches, fever, fatigue and severe
muscle pains.

[Reports of dengue outbreaks from sub-Saharan Africa are extremely
rare. It has been suggested that clinical dengue disease seldom
occurs in Africa, perhaps due to the genetic makeup of the
population. Alternatively, dengue surveillance may not be active
enough to detect dengue cases. Both factors may be involved. ProMED
would appreciate receiving reports of dengue cases from Africa.

Survey results are back from the [USA's] Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention's dengue research center in Puerto Rico and, out of
240 Old Town Key West residents who gave blood for testing, 99 tested
positive for dengue fever [virus?] or the associated antibodies.

More specifically:
- 91 people tested positive for dengue antibodies, meaning that at
some point in their lives, they had been exposed to the virus.
- 6 tested positive for having had the virus in the past 3 months.
- 2 tested "acute positive," meaning they actually had dengue fever
when their blood was drawn a month ago.

Dengue fever was 1st reported in Key West in July [2009]. It
represented the 1st documented presence of dengue in Florida in more
than 40 years.

Monroe County Health Department Administrator Bob Eadie said Friday
[13 Nov 2009] ... of the cases confirmed in Key West, the vast
majority have been asymptomatic, and treatment has been successful.

Mark Whiteside, the county's executive medical director, said that
generally speaking, dengue outbreaks "come in waves. This is our
golden opportunity over the winter to see if we can nip this thing in the bud."

Winter is significant, as it is the dry season, which is bad for
mosquitoes looking to lay eggs in stagnant freshwater.

"Old Town Key West probably represents one of the most ideal breeding
habitats in the country," Ed Fussell, director of the Florida Keys
Mosquito Control District, said. That in mind, he stressed the
importance of residents taking steps to eliminate breeding habitats
by emptying containers that hold water. "The key is breaking that
breeding cycle, and that depends on public cooperation," Eadie said.

[The 13 Nov 2009 edition of the Miami Herald forwarded by ProMED-mail
Correspondent Susan Baekeland
(<http://www.miamiherald.com/news/florida/AP/story/1332029.html>)
reported that the survey was launched after 3 confirmed cases of
dengue surfaced in Old Town Key West in August 2009, the 1st locally
acquired cases of the mosquito-borne illness reported in the state in
more than 40 years. Of the people who tested positive for the
antibody, 8 are thought to have contracted the virus locally in Key
West within the last 3 months. All have fully recovered, health
officials said Friday (13 Nov 2009) during a conference call. No more
cases have been reported, and the virus was confined to the Key West
area. "The results are significant in that they indicate the virus is
present in Key West," said Monroe County Health Department
Administrator Bob Eadie. Researchers from the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention and the Florida Department of Health conducted
the survey with help from the Monroe County Health Department and the
Florida Keys Mosquito Control District from 23 - 27 Sep 2009.

Although serological results without dengue virus isolation or
demonstration of virus-specific genetic sequences are to be
interpreted with considerable caution, the CDC Puerto Rico laboratory
has decades of experience with dengue virus isolation and serological
testing. Flaviviruses are notorious for cross reactions, and apparent
dengue serological positives might be due to prior exposure with
another flavivirus. It would be of interest to know which serological
tests were used, as some (such as virus plaque reduction
neutralization) are more specific than others (such as
hemagglutination-inhibition).

A dengue outbreak that stressed the Dominican epidemiological system
has begun to subside, said an official source, who indicated that the
disease has taken 44 lives. The number of [dengue virus] infected
people reached 4998, of which 325 suffered the DHF form of the
disease, which is endemic in the Caribbean and Central America,
reported the Subsecretary of Health, Nelson Rodriguez.

The flow of people with dengue symptoms to hospitals began to decline
from a date that Rodriguez did not specify, and he predicted an even
greater reduction thanks to the preventive measures adopted by the
government recently.

Last week, the Secretariat of Health declared a national
epidemiological alarm and initiated a fumigation campaign and cleanup
of trash and patios of houses in order to control the breeding of the
_Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, the dengue [virus] vector.

The official admitted that the number of [dengue] infections is more
than that reported in the [official] statistics, which could be
multiplied by 10 due to the fact that "most of the infected people do
not go to the hospitals (because) their clinical pictures are mild."

Health authorities reported 20 cases in the Puentesino area in the
Concepcion department [state or province equivalent], for which a
possible dengue outbreak is being investigated. One of the affected
individuals is in serious condition, but the laboratory results are
still awaited to confirm whether [he] has the disease.

The score of fever cases was identified this weekend, and one of
those affected had to be hospitalized, the Director of Health
Surveillance, Ivan Allende, and the Vice Minister of Health, Edgar
Gimenez, reported at a press conference.

Puentesino is a city on the border with Brazil, where 3 dengue
[virus] serotypes are circulating currently, but Allende indicated
that [dengue virus] serotye 1, which "is the recognized one here,"
could seriously affect those people who had the disease in the
previous epidemic in Paraguay.

The laboratory results that will or will not confirm these suspected
[dengue] cases will be available in 48 hours they said.

Last week, Health confirmed the 1st [dengue] case -- imported -- then
cut off circulation of dengue [virus] in the country. A Mexican
citizen who entered the country on 23 Oct [2009] tested [dengue]
positive by [laboratory] studies, so Health conducted an
epidemiological blockade, and no secondary cases were found.

The Central department recorded a high number of _Aedes aegypti_
larvae, the [mosquito] vector. Ypacarai is one of the cities with the
highest infestation rate. Meanwhile, in Asuncion, the Vista Alegre
neighborhood is the one with the largest number of larvae positive
for dengue [virus], according to a Health report.

In Ypacarai, 14 percent of the houses visited had larvae of the
mosquito. In Asuncion, the neighborhood with the greatest number of
larvae is Vista Alegre, with 9.25 percent, according to the data
provided by the [office of] the Director General of Health
Surveillance. The Ministry of Health recommends that levels of larval
infestation be maintained at less than one percent to avoid dengue circulation.

[6] Australia (Queensland)

Dengue fever has returned to north Queensland, just 3 months after
health officials declared an end to the worst outbreak in 50 years.
The early onset of the mosquito-borne virus this season has
authorities desperate to stop the insects from breeding and spreading
the potentially deadly disease. During the last outbreak, more than
1000 people were infected, and re-infection could have serious health
consequences.

Queensland Health medical director Jeffrey Hannah tried but could not
hide his surprise at its early return. "We expect dengue to arrive at
any time here in north Queensland; we've got international airports,
and we're very close to Asia and the South Pacific, so yes, we expect
dengue to arrive in travellers any time of the year," he said. "The
thing which has come as a bit of a surprise to many of us is this
very early summer rain. It's dragged on and been very intensive, very
good rainfall overnight here in Cairns of course. We know that ...
this will fill up all the containers that mosquitoes -- the dengue
mosquitoes -- breed in. We also know that once the rain clears, it's
going to be hot and steamy until the wet season well and truly
arrives. This combination is ideal for dengue, the dengue mosquito;
it's priming us, if you like, for dengue outbreaks."

Dr Hannah says 3 Cairns residents have been diagnosed with dengue
after travelling to Malaysia, India and Viet Nam. He says the 3 had
contact with other locals before the fever was diagnosed, and there
is a chance the virus could spread. "On top of it, you're aware that
we've now just recognised someone in Townsville in the suburb of
Garbutt who's got dengue and that person has not travelled," he said.
"So that person has picked it up locally, which means that there must
have been a traveller we didn't recognise who's infected local mosquitoes."

Dr Hannah says GPs in Cairns and Townsville have been alerted to
dengue's return, but he says the 4 infected people will not be
quarantined. "Certainly, when people are sick and convalescing at
home, we ask them to try and stay behind screened windows and so on,
in a screened house if possible," he said. "But there's no mandatory
quarantine; it's something we ask people to do for their own family's
sake and for the broader community's sake."

During the last epidemic, over 1000 people in Queensland's north
contracted dengue fever, and for the 1st time, all 4 strains of the
virus were present, although strain 3 was responsible for 90 percent of cases.

Dr Brian Montgomery, a senior medical entomologist with Queensland
Health, says there is already an assortment of strains circulating
this season. "The imports into Cairns are dengue [virus] type 2,
which is different to what the epidemic was, dengue [virus type] 3,
earlier this year [2009]," he said. "The case in Townsville is dengue
[virus] 1."

Dr Montgomery is concerned about those people who had dengue last
season catching it again. "If you had dengue 3 earlier this year
[2009], you definitely do not want to catch dengue [virus] 2 or 1 or
4 this year, because that's when we see these more severe
complications of dengue," he said. "But our response is to control
mosquitoes irrespective of what type they're carrying. So our
take-home message from this is if you're developing any sort of
dengue type symptoms, don't waste any time in getting to a doctor and
getting a blood test. Either that'll assure you that you don't have
dengue or it would say that you have got dengue and will determine
where Queensland Health and the local councils can respond."

So far, dengue fever has only struck in Queensland's north, but
infectious diseases experts say the virus is likely to be common in
all Australian capital cities by 2050. They say the spread of urban
water tanks and increasing warmer weather may see dengue spread south.

mosquito vector will prevent the kind of dengue outbreak that
occurred in Queensland last year (2008).

A dengue fever epidemic reportedly occurred in Medan throughout
October and November [2009], commonly associated with the rainy
season in Indonesia, indicated by dengue patient numbers found in
municipal-owned Pirngadi hospital in Medan, North Sumatra.

A Waspada Online journalist cited the hospital spokesman, Susyanto,
that dengue patient numbers rose 200 percent in just a one month
period, in which 10 dengue patients were treated in September 2009.
"However, in October 2009, there were 43 people attended for this
infectious disease in the hospital," he told Waspada Online here
Tuesday [10 Nov 2009].

"Besides a high rainfall rate, an ineffective trash disposal facility
and an unimpressive people's Exterminating Mosquito Breeding Site
program [have contributed to the dengue problem]," Susyanto said.

"Pemko would hold the preventive programs as soon as possible," he explained.

With 45 fresh cases, the number of dengue patients in the national
capital shot up to 661 today [11 Nov 2009], even as the ruling BJP in
MCD sought to deflect the blame on authorities in Delhi's
neighbourhood saying lack of preventive measures there was aiding its spread.

The civic agency has intensified its drive to check breeding of
mosquitoes and has legally cited 6501 people so far, Municipal Health
Officer, MCD, N K Yadav told reporters here. He said 46 503 legal
notices have been issued. According to Yadav, a total of 1335 people
were cited in one day after mosquito breeding was detected on their premises.

"The total number of cases has reached 661. Fresh cases are 45. There
are 11 cases in which the infection has been contracted from outside
the city," he said. The capital has seen 2 dengue deaths so far.
