A fresh anthrax outbreak has caused a scare in Khanjaloya Kadamtoli village under Pakartand block, where 2 tribals have been found infected with the life-threatening disease.

The fatal disease anthrax has again shown signs of comeback in Jharkhand's Simdega district, as 2 individuals were tested positive on Monday [18 Jun 2018]. Both are being treated in the district hospital.

Over 200 cases of anthrax were reported from the district in the last 2 years, out which 11 succumbed to the disease.

Simdega Civil Surgeon AE Ashraf confirmed the anthrax outbreak saying: "Both infected from the disease are out of danger. We are running an awareness program in the district. Impoverished tribals tend to skin the dead animals for meat, which seems to be the primary reason for the fresh outbreak."

A medical team is visiting the affected and neighbouring villages for early identification of other anthrax infected individuals. The civil surgeon said a team of veterinary doctors had been dispatched to vaccinate domestic animals.

Talking to News18, some villagers said that on 22 May 2018, they consumed meat of a dead goat. After some days, 2 of them complained of skin problems. Both were rushed to the district hospital where the anthrax infection was confirmed.

The disease has been showing signs of a comeback for the last 2 years in Kolebira area of Simdega.

[For a map showing Jharkhand, go to: http://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/india_pol01.jpg. It is in northeast India on the northern border of Orissa and abutting West Bengal. For a description of Jharkhand, go to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jharkhand.

Goats are browsers, so while they do graze and could thus acquire a soil-based infection, if it was from blowfly-contaminated browse, it would indicate an ongoing livestock anthrax problem in the background of this village or a neighbouring village. Goats make poor targets for haemophagic flies and can be missed when the disease is raging in other species. Goats can be vaccinated with Sterne, but a half dose is better than a full dose for goats. - Mod.MHJ
