[West Nile fever (WNF), a mosquito-borne viral disease that can affect birds, humans and horses and cause inapparent infection, mild febrile illness, meningitis, encephalitis or death, has been known for decades to be limited, in Europe, to the south. In the early 2000s, it started a slow spread northward, reaching Hungary in 2004 and Austria in 2008. The identification of the virus in an animal (owl) in Germany is the 1st reported event north of Austria, as apparent from the interactive OIE global map (WNF 2006-2018) at https://tinyurl.com/yav7dj4n (click on Germany, zoom in). WNF was added to OIE's list in 2006, being a zoonotic disease with potential for transboundary spread.

The following commentary by Mod.UBA (<20180824.5979053>) addressed WNF in Europe during 2018:

"West Nile virus activity is on the rise, with a higher number of cases being reported this year [2018] with multiple outbreaks across Europe. This is largely due to the early start of the 2018 transmission season in the WHO European Region, which normally lasts from July to October. This year's season has been characterized by high temperatures and extended rainy spells, followed by dry weather. Such weather conditions have been conducive to mosquito breeding and propagation."

West Nile virus (WNV) is a member of the genus _Flavivirus_ in the family Flaviviridae. The arbovirus is maintained in nature by cycling through birds and mosquitoes; numerous avian and mosquito species support virus replication. For many avian species, WNV infection causes no overt signs, whereas other birds, such as American crows (_Corvus brachyrhynchos_) and blue jays (_Cyanocitta cristata_), often succumb to fatal systemic illness. Among mammals, clinical disease is primarily exhibited in horses and humans. Another domestic animal, namely goose, is also known to suffer clinical disease and mortalities (Israel, 1998; see also at https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2001.tb02691.x).
