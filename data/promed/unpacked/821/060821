[This outbreak of CSF was the 1st to be recorded in Israel since
1948; it was controlled by modified stamping out, quarantine measures
and regional vaccination. The following epidemiological information
was included in the comments, provided by the Israeli authorities to
the OIE (see summary of the event, with map, at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=7861>):

"The farm is located at about 3.5 km from the Lebanese border,
through which wild boars can pass. 11 wild boars were found dead in a
4-km-radius area around the farm. Antigen detection has shown
positive results for classical swine fever and bovine viral
diarrhoea. Advanced laboratory test (PCR) performed in the Kimron
Veterinary Institute (Israel) has found the virus in domestic pigs.
The PCR has shown 97 percent homology with the virus isolates from
China (2002) and 98 percent homology with the virus isolates from
Germany (1997)."

CSF was later confirmed by the OIE reference laboratory in Germany
(University of Veterinary Medicine - Hanover). We have noted that the
said laboratory identified the CSFV involved as genotype 2.1. The
sequencing data will be helpful.

At the genetic level, CSFVs can be divided into genotypes 1, 2, and
3, based on the partial sequences of the E2 and NS5B genes. Each
genotype can be classified further into 3 or 4 sub-genotypes,
referred to as 1.1, 1.2, 1.3; 2.1, 2.2, 2.3; and 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4,
respectively.

Detailed genetic information about CSFV field isolates can be used to
form an important database for molecular epidemiology, which may
assist in the detection of the virus' origin.

As indicated in the reference paper below, citing various sources,
all CSFV strains in Europe were genotype 1 prior to the 1970s, but
the various sub-genotype strains 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 were isolated from
different European countries during the 1980s and 1990s. CSF is still
endemic currently in various European countries. In Asia, CSF
epidemics are also fairly ubiquitous, and strains of genotypes 1, 2,
and 3 have been isolated in different Asian countries.

The infection could have been introduced by wild boars from Lebanon.
However, such an assumption is in need of verification. Moreover, CSF
is still to be identified, recorded and reported in Lebanon. Still,
the source of the virus introduced into the region is in need of
investigation. It will be helpful while expressing desirable
transparency if sequence data of animal viruses, such as CSF, will be
deposited by laboratories and scientific institutions, in particular
reference laboratories, into publicly available databases.
