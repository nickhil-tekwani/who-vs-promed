Mouse Birth Control Experiments Spark Fears of Bioterrorism
-----------------------------------------------------------
[A report in "New Scientist" magazine states that Australian scientists,
who have accidently created a deadly version of mouse smallpox in the
laboratory, say lethal human viruses are only a step away. The prospect of
such dangerous organisms being produced relatively easily has left
bioterrorism experts fearful of killer global epidemics. [These are highly
emotive and alarmist statements. To put the matter in perspective, it
should have been made clear that Ectromelia virus (also called mousepox
virus) is one of 9 distinct virus species (infecting different mammalian
hosts) which make up the genus _Orthopoxvirus_ of the family
_Poxviridae_. So far the experiments involve only laboratory mice. - Mod.CP.
The Australian researchers, reported New Scientist magazine, made one
simple genetic change to a "mousepox" virus in an attempt to produce an
effective contraceptive vaccine. "Mousepox" normally causes only mild
illness, and when all the animals undergoing the experiment died within
days, the scientist realized the potential of their discovery. They say a
similar [mutation in human smallpox virus [theoretically could produce a
far more virulent strain which could even be resistant to vaccines. [It
should be remembered that the human smallpox virus has been eradicated from
nature, and survives only in 2 high security laboratories. - Mod.CP
[The experiment referred to apparently involved the insertion of a gene
which produces a [cytokine called interleukin-4 (Il-4) into the mousepox
virus genome. The idea was to stimulate an immune reaction against mouse
eggs, [thereby producing a contraceptive effect. However, the effect was
to completely suppress the part of the immune system normally mobilized to
fight viral infection. Dr. Ron Jackson, who led the research, said: "It
would be safe to assume that if some idiot did put human IL-4 into human
smallpox [virus they'd increase the lethality quite dramatically." In
addition, vaccination against mousepox appeared to have far less of a
protective effect for those infected with the new strain. In fact, only
half those mice vaccinated survived infection.
Professor John Bartlett, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Civil
Biodefense Studies in Baltimore, was quoted as saying that "I wouldn't have
thought you would need anything more virulent than smallpox already is to
cause a global epidemic. There is a lot of concern about it -- the entire
world is vulnerable because no one has immunity." He added that "If a new
vaccine needs to be developed from scratch, we are talking about several
years minimum. There are enough rogue nations and dissidents trying to do
this."
A spokesman for Friends of the Earth called for much closer scrutiny of
laboratory experiments. Susan Meyer, of the pressure group Genewatch,
which is calling for more openness on the part of the biotechnology
industry, said that: "This discovery should really alert people to the fact
that genetically altering organisms can have unexpected outcomes.
A spokesman for the UK Ministry of Defence's biological research facility
at Porton Down said that "Making scientists aware of the full potential of
their discoveries is important, but inevitably it carries the same risk in
bringing possibilities to the attention of the unscrupulous. We seek to be
aware of what possibilities are open to aggressor countries or
terrorists. By the nature of things, this is always a game of
catch-up. And there are already so many possibilities that absolute
protection is not possible without the sort of constraints that are not
acceptable in a free society."

[Viruses that successfully replicate within the host have devised
strategies to subvert or evade the challenges posed by the innate and
adaptive immune responses. Many investigators are beginning to dissect the
diverse and complex interactions involving cytokines, chemokines, chemokine
receptors and viral infection, and much attention has been focused on the
role of secreted cytokine and chemokine inhibitors, and chemokines in
antiviral defense. Ectromelia virus (EV) is a natural mouse pathogen that
causes a generalized infection termed mousepox, which, in the
genetically-resistant C57BL/6 (B6) mouse, is an inapparent disease. In
contrast, BALB/c and A strain mice are highly susceptible; one infectious
virus particle can result in 100% mortality. The contribution of cytokines
in the induction of protective immune responses and recovery from infection
with EV in B6, BALB/c and A strain mice is well known. This type of
research will promote better understanding of protective immune responses
and their experimental enhancement as much as their inhibition. An
unfortunate by-product of this New Scientist article is that it has
provoked a negative response from Friends of the Earth to the effect that:
"We simply don't know enough to allow these experiments at present." - Mod.CP
