The New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets is advising owners, boarders, and riders to watch their horses closely for signs of equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) after several cases of the virus were confirmed in horses boarded in Canton, St Lawrence County, and Geneseo, Livingston County. The virus is not a threat to humans, but people can also spread the virus from infected horses to other horses.

The department is investigating the cases at St. Lawrence University's horse-boarding facility and Leg Up Stables, which is home to SUNY [State University of New York] Geneseo's equestrian team. The stables are working closely with the department and have voluntarily quarantined their animals and proactively instituted biosafety measures.

Horses and people who visited the facilities, competed at the venues, or had contact with these animals from 23 Feb through 10 Mar 2019 may have been exposed to EHV-1. This virus may cause neurological signs, or equine herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHM) in horses. Signs can include fever, loss of balance, and unsteady gait. In addition, people who visited the affected facilities during that time and those who had contact with these horses should pay close attention to biosecurity and carefully observe their own horses daily for neurological signs, which can indicate exposure to EHV-1. They also are advised to contact their veterinarian and the Division of Animal Industry at the NYS Department of Agriculture and Markets at 518-457-3502.

If possible, exposed horses should be isolated from other horses for at least 3 weeks after a known [or suspected - Mod.TG] exposure. If an exposed horse has not shown any signs of EHV-1 infection for 3 weeks after the last known exposure, it is likely safe to resume normal activities. Vaccinations, while helpful, do not guarantee disease prevention.

Information on the disease, standards for biosecurity, control, and other guidelines can be found online. Precautions like washing hands, using disinfectant and sanitizers, changing clothes, and not sharing equipment can help reduce the risk of transmission.

[The commonest way for EHV-1 to spread is by direct, horse-to-horse contact. This virus is shed from infected horses via the respiratory tract or through direct or indirect contact with an infected aborted fetus and fetal membranes.

Horses may appear to be perfectly healthy yet spread the virus via the secretions from their nostrils. It is important to realize that EHV-1 can also be spread indirectly through contact with physical objects contaminated with infectious virus. Examples of such objects include
- tack,
- wipe rags or other grooming equipment,
- feed and water buckets, and
- people's hands or clothing.

The air around a horse that is shedding the virus can also be contaminated with infectious virus. Although we know that the virus can become airborne, it is difficult to establish the distance the virus can spread in this manner under typical horse management and environmental conditions.

The standard form of care for EHM is primarily supportive. Treatments may include intravenous fluids or anti-inflammatory drugs. Antibiotics may be used to treat a secondary bacterial infection if one develops; however, antibiotics have no effect on the equine herpesvirus itself. Antiviral drugs have also been used to treat EHM cases. Research on the efficacy of these drugs, their cost effectiveness, and the optimal dosing regimen for EHM is still under way https://www.aphis.usda.gov/vs/nahss/equine/ehv/equine_herpesvirus_brochure_2009.pdf.

Any time I visit an exposition of any kind -- livestock show/expo, race, rodeo, show, or any type of gathering where animals are, including veterinary facilities -- I frequently wash my hands. Upon arrival home, I change clothes before seeing any of my animals. I am always suspicious something could have been incubating, and I don't want to take any chance of bringing something home to my animals. Don't track it back!

The same is true when returning home from an animal hospital or a human medical facility. I don't want to track something back with me, possibly exposing an animal or another human being. Boots and shoes are disinfected, and clothes are washed promptly. Boots or shoes worn at any show/exposition facility or animal/human hospital are always disinfected and dried for 24 hours before being used near my own animals. Some may see this as extreme, but it is biosecurity. It is not worth the risk to track back an illness/disease that could be prevented. - Mod.TG
