_Candida auris_ in healthcare settings - Europe, 1st update
------------------------------------------------------------
Main conclusions and options for response
-----------------------------------------
_Candida auris_ poses a risk for patients in healthcare facilities across Europe due to its propensity to cause outbreaks and its antifungal resistance. Difficulties with laboratory identification and lack of awareness of this _Candida_ species may delay early detection increasing the potential for horizontal transmission. _C. auris_ was first identified in 2009 and within a few years has emerged as a cause of healthcare-associated infections. Outbreaks have been reported in countries in 5 continents. The number of reported _C. auris_ cases in European countries has increased significantly since the last ECDC rapid risk assessment on _C. auris_ in December 2016. There continues to be a need to raise awareness of _C. auris_ in European healthcare facilities, so that they may adapt their laboratory testing strategies and implement enhanced infection prevention and control measures where necessary.

Options to reduce identified risks: prevention of transmission of _C. auris_ in healthcare settings
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Laboratory detection of _C. auris_
----------------------------------
Recognition of _C. auris_ requires that isolates of _Candida_ species from invasive infections are accurately identified to the species level. A correct identification of _C. auris_ is possible using either Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, provided that _C. auris_ is included in the reference profile database, or DNA sequencing of specific domains of the ribosomal genes. When these tests are not available at clinical laboratory level, referral of non-albicans _Candida_ spp. invasive isolates to a reference mycology laboratory is advisable, especially if identified by biochemical tests as _C. haemulonii_, _C. famata_, _C. sake_, _Rhodotorula_ species, or _Saccharomyces_ species. This is particularly important for hospitals with an increased incidence of infection by non-albicans _Candida_ species or those that admit patients transferred from a facility reporting a _C. auris_ outbreak. Where _Candida_ species isolates are tested for antifungal susceptibility, resistance to fluconazole is another characteristic that should prompt tests to speciate the _Candida_ isolate.

Standard infection control measures
-----------------------------------
Good standard infection control, including environmental cleaning, adequate cleaning and reprocessing of medical devices, and adequate capacity of microbiological laboratories, as well as sufficient capacity of healthcare facilities for patient isolation, are the basis for the prevention of transmission of any pathogen in healthcare settings.

Preventing transmission from patients known to carry _C. auris_
---------------------------------------------------------------
Early, robust action is recommended to prevent an outbreak as these can be prolonged, costly, and may pose significant risk to compromised patients. Prompt notification of _C. auris_ to the clinical and infection control teams is essential to implement infection control precautions in a timely manner and to ensure vigilance for development of infections in patients found to be colonised. The detection of a case of _C. auris_ should trigger an investigation including a detailed case review and screening of close contact patients for _C. auris_ carriage. More extensive contact tracing can be considered based on a case-by-case risk assessment (for example, taking into account the type of patient population and ward in which the _C. auris_ case is detected, and the extent of _C. auris_ colonisation and of the contacts of the affected patient).

Infection control options for hospitals to consider implementing include enhanced control measures such as contact precautions, single room isolation or patient cohorting, and dedicated nursing staff for patients who are colonised or infected with _C. auris_. As there are currently no established protocols for decolonisation and determining when it is safe to end isolation, these precautions need to be applied until the discharge of the patient from the hospital. Screening of close contacts of identified cases for _C. auris_ carriage with axilla and groin swabs is an important component of the response to _C. auris_. Other sites (urine, wounds, catheter exit sites, throat, etc.) can be sampled, if clinically relevant or indicated.

Emphasis is required on the terminal cleaning and disinfection of rooms after discharge of patients who carry, or are infected with, _C. auris_, using chlorine-based disinfectants (at a concentration of 1000 ppm), hydrogen-peroxide or other disinfectants with documented fungicidal activity. Quaternary ammonium compound disinfectants should be avoided. Single use equipment or equipment specific to a _C. auris_ patient or cohort is preferable where possible as patient shared equipment has been found to be contaminated with _C. auris_ in an outbreak situation. Ensuring that cleaning and disinfection of reusable equipment (e.g., monitoring devices, thermometers, pulse oximeters, blood pressure measuring instruments, etc.) is performed according to manufacturer's instructions is also important. Environmental sampling or screening of healthcare workers are not routinely recommended.

Additional control options for outbreaks
----------------------------------------
Raising awareness and providing education to all healthcare groups is essential to manage the outbreak. Prompt initiation of an epidemiological investigation, complemented by cross-sectional screening of patients for _C. auris_ carriage, is useful to establish the source of the outbreak and thus prevent further cases. Potentially effective enhanced measures to control _C. auris_ outbreaks include regular active surveillance cultures for _C. auris_ carriage of all patients in affected wards, cohorting of _C. auris_-positive patients with dedicated nursing staff in separate areas, as well as rigorous environmental cleaning and disinfection. Education and practice audits to improve compliance of healthcare workers with hand hygiene, contact precautions and supervision of appropriate implementation of environmental cleaning are important supportive interventions. Hospital senior management support is needed to provide adequate resources for the implementation of appropriate infection control measures.

Antimicrobial stewardship
-------------------------
Although there is no evidence for a specific beneficial effect of antimicrobial stewardship on the emergence and spread of _C. auris_, it is likely that an environment with a high level of broad-spectrum antibacterial and antifungal use will favour the emergence of multidrug-resistant yeasts, such as _C. auris_. Therefore, the implementation of antimicrobial stewardship is likely to mitigate the risks of _C. auris_ acquisition and transmission, as well as being an essential component of strategies to reduce antimicrobial resistance in general. The need for antifungal prophylaxis should be reviewed in terms of risk-benefit analysis in settings with evidence of _C. auris_ transmission.

Prevention of inter-hospital transmission, including cross-border transmission
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Admission screening for _C. auris_ carriage and pre-emptive isolation of patients who are transferred from, or have recently been admitted to hospitals that have detected _C. auris_ cases should be considered. This implies that affected facilities need to notify the receiving healthcare facilities and clinicians in the case of transfer of patients with _C. auris_ carriage or infection. Moreover, gathering reliable epidemiological data through notification of _C. auris_ cases to public health authorities and exchange of information through electronic early warning platforms, such as the Epidemic Intelligence System (EPIS), will enable informed and coordinated risk management actions by public health authorities across the EU/EEA.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reported cases and outbreaks
----------------------------
"We received replies to the survey from 29 of 30 EU/EEA countries with separate replies from the United Kingdom (UK) for England and Scotland. From 2013 to 2017, a total of 620 _C. auris_ cases were reported from six countries (Figure 1)."

"Cases were reported from Spain (n=388), the UK (n=221), Germany (n=7), France (n=2), Belgium (n=1) and Norway (n=1) in the period from 2013 to 2017. Austria detected one case in January 2018. The majority of cases were reported as colonisations (n=466; 75.2 percent), while a bloodstream or other type of infection was reported in 150 cases (24.2 percent). For 4 cases (0.6 percent) the colonisation/infection status was unknown. The annual number of cases and information on the infection or colonisation status and the type of infection (bloodstream or other type) are shown in Table 1. no. _C. auris_ colonisation or invasive infection had been detected in 15 countries and in seven countries the National Focal Points did not have information on _C. auris_ cases available at the national level (Figure 2).

"Two countries had experienced 4 nosocomial outbreaks of _C. auris_ affecting 573 patients in total. The number of cases per outbreak ranged from 39 to 382 according to national reporting. Inter-facility transmission occurred in the 4 outbreaks and one outbreak lasted nearly 2 years. 3 outbreaks were controlled whereas one outbreak was still ongoing as at January 2018. Measures to control these outbreaks included contact precautions, single room isolation, cohorting, contact screening, and enhanced environmental disinfection."

Discussion
----------
"The reason why some cases of _C. auris_ have caused large outbreaks while other cases were sporadic with no apparent further transmission remains unclear. However, reports of sporadic cases might represent a 'tip of the iceberg' phenomenon, as only few isolates might reach mycology reference laboratories and no information is available whether contact screening surrounding these sporadic cases was performed to exclude further transmission.

"Early detection of _C. auris_ is necessary for preventing further colonisations, invasive infections, and outbreaks. With the increasing number of _C. auris_ cases in the EU/EEA, it is of concern that some countries still lack national laboratory reference capacity for mycology or have no information on _C. auris_ cases available at national public health level. Due to the lack of laboratory capability for routine detection and surveillance, recognition of _C. auris_ introduction into a healthcare facility might be delayed until spread has already occurred. Mycology reference laboratory capacity is all the more important due to the increasing use of immunosuppressive therapy, antimicrobial and antifungal treatment or prophylaxis that increase the risk for fungal infection or the risk for antifungal drug resistance [13,14]. The emergence of _C. auris_ with the propensity to spread, cause invasive infections and survive in the environment, further highlights the need for adequate mycology reference capacity.

"Mycology reference laboratory capacity can only contribute to _C. auris_ control if clinicians and hospital laboratories are aware of this threat and react in a timely way to an increase in severe _Candida_ spp. infections or detection of an isolate of _C. auris_. This also requires an increased effort for more extensive speciation of _Candida_ spp. isolates from bloodstream and other invasive infections and, under certain circumstances, for example if _C. auris_ has already been detected in a healthcare facility, also of isolates from other non-sterile body sites [15,16]. The occurrence of a single case of _C. auris_ in a hospital requires an adequate response to prevent further spread [17]. However, not all of the surveyed countries have so far issued clinical or laboratory alerts to increase awareness at hospital level.

"In conclusion, _C. auris_ is detected with increasing frequency and large outbreaks have occurred in Europe since 2013. To mitigate the risk from the introduction of _C. auris_ and to prevent and control its further spread, adequate laboratory capacity, surveillance, and infection control preparedness is required in all EU/EEA countries."
