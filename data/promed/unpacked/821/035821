Typhoid fever (also known as enteric fever or typhus abdominalis) [The term
abdominal typhus is a confusing one but relates to the initial difficulties
in distinguishing infection due to _Salmonella Typhi_ and _Rickettsia
prowazekii_. - Mod.LL] has been a chronic problem in Fiji for several
years, but the number of cases has increased substantially in the Northern
Division over recent months. In 2005, 127 cases were reported in the
Northern Division of Fiji (compared to 11 each in the previous 2 years).
113 cases have been treated in the Division so far in 2006. No
typhoid-related death has been reported in the Division for the past 22 years.
The Ministry of Health believes that the incidence of typhoid appears to
have increased after Cyclone Ami. While there were few endemic areas
previously with point source outbreaks, the recent trends show the spread
to many more villages and settlements.

An epidemic in Luliang County, in south west China's Yunnan Province, that
left 39 villagers racked with severe pain, left one person dead as of Tue
22 Aug 2006, with 3 others in hospital. The 39 people are all from Xincun
Village in the township of Damogu, which has a population of 2100.
Four experts from the provincial disease control center arrived at the
village on Monday night, 21 Aug 2006. The 1st results of their
investigation suggest that the people had typhoid fever.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dan Silver for this submission. The submitter also
relates that Chinese press reports state that the outbreak is confirmed to
be a mix of typhoid and paratyphoid. A map of Yunnan Province in south west

West Kochi continues to reel under typhoid. 82 cases were reported in
August 2006, 56 of them in the government hospital at Fort Kochi. Most of
the cases have been reported from Cherlai, Nellu, Thuruthi, and Kalvethy.
Only 82 cases were recorded in 2005. In 2006, 321 were reported already.
The recent heavy rain has added to the problem, since typhoid spreads
through infected water and food. All 59 water samples collected from
different places in west Kochi this year [2006] were found contaminated,
said a health official.
