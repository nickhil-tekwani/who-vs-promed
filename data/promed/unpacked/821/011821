Stay on culling extended: UK lab report on sheep filed in SHC
-------------------------------------------------------------
The Sindh High Court [SHC] on Friday [12 Oct 2012] further stayed the culling of imported Australian sheep as a British laboratory report produced in the court stated that the imported sheep were free of certain fatal diseases and there was no reason to exclude them from being processed for human consumption on this ground.

A division bench of the SHC comprising Justices Maqbool Baqar and Naimatullah Phulpoto was seized with a petition of the animal importer, Tariq Mehmood Butt, who had sought a restraining order against the culling of 21 000 sheep by the city municipal administration.

On Friday, the report sent by Dr Jef Hammond, the head of the Vesicular Disease Reference Laboratories of the Pirbright Institute, Surrey, was submitted in the court and it was read over by one of the bench members.

The report said: "I wish to inform you that the sheep samples numbered 1 to 102 received from Pakistan on 3rd of October and tested here at the reference laboratories, Pirbright have tested negative for the presence of antibodies to Bluetongue Virus, PPR Virus and FMD Virus. Please see enclosed reports. The interpretation of these results is that because of no antibodies to these disease agents were found then the sheep were not infected with these diseases and there is no reason to exclude them from being processed for human consumption on these grounds subject to the usual meat inspection processes."

The SHC had on 28 Sep 2012 ordered testing of the imported Australian sheep from an internationally acclaimed laboratory after receiving contradictory reports by the federal and provincial government testing facilities regarding the health of the herd.

The bench had also observed that the foreign laboratory should, if possible, also express its opinion regarding the probable reasons, causes for the disease or the infection as may be found and again if possible the probable time as to when the sheep had no such infection.

The court had observed that the lab should also give its findings as to whether the meat of the sheep was safe for human consumption or not.

The petitioner purchased the consignment after it had been refused by an importer in Bahrain. He sought an injunction against the disposal of the sheep, contending that the animals were not infected with any disease. He also prayed to the court to restrain the government functionaries from harassing or arresting him.

The provincial livestock and fisheries department had ordered the culling of the sheep after tests found them infected and unfit for human consumption.

Upholding its earlier restraining order on the culling of 21 000 sheep, the high court adjourned the hearing till 17 Oct 2012.

[2] Pakistani inquiry committee report
Date: Thu 11 Oct 2012

Australian sheep saga: Quarantine Act rules violated in import of sheep
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
An independent enquiry committee, constituted by the Ministry of National Food Security and Research to look into the import of purportedly diseased Australian sheep, has found that the rules laid down under the Pakistan Animal Quarantine Act, 1979, were violated while clearing the consignment during the 1st week of September [2012].

In its 26-page assessment report, which is available with The Express Tribune, the 4-member committee stated that the importer had most likely concealed the fact from the ministry that the consignment had already been rejected by the veterinary authorities of Bahrain. Moreover, it also cast aspersions on the authenticity of the certificate of health issued reportedly by Australian veterinary authorities.

"The certificate of health, bearing No 612-000891, signed by the authorised Australian veterinary officer on 1 Sep 2012 at Perth -- about 27 days after the ship had left Australia -- seems to be fake and bogus," the report said. It added that a thorough examination and verification of documents, such as the health certificate and the commercial invoice, had not been carried out on the vessel.

Commenting on the fact that the director of the Animal Quarantine Department (AQD) had inspected the sheep on board, the committee said the Pakistan Animal Quarantine Rules, 1980, did not authorise the AQD director to exercise the powers of quarantine officer, and that this was "beyond his defined mandate."

The report scathingly criticises officials concerned, while pointing out that the farm of PK Livestock and Meat Company was registered with the AQD as a 'slaughter house' -- not quarantine, which refers to premises approved by the federal government for isolation and examination of animals intended for import or export.

"The competent authority of the Ministry of National Food Security and Research has not declared the aforesaid premises as 'quarantine house' for keeping the sheep in isolation. Therefore, the reply (of the quarantine officer) is not reasonable, and is contrary to the provision of the Pakistan Animal Quarantine Act, 1979."

It said the premises where the sheep were stationed were not approved by the competent authority. "The purpose of quarantine was defeated when the imported sheep were shifted to a slaughterhouse, where other animals were also kept for slaughtering purposes."

Describing the conditions they witnessed during a visit to the farm, the committee members observed that the animals were kept in an open area without "the basic facility of shade or shelter."

Meanwhile, the Sindh High Court is expected to hold an urgent hearing of the case on Friday [12 Oct 2012; see item [1] above]. The government has reportedly received the test results of 102 samples taken from the Australian sheep, which were earlier sent to a British laboratory.

Inquiry committee report released: Serious violations of rules in import of Australian sheep
---------------------------------
The inquiry committee was constituted vide letter Dy No 1572-AHC dated: 11 Sep 2012 to probe in the case about arrival of the sheep from Australia to Karachi. Dr Muhammad Ilyas, quarantine officer AQD Peshawar (convener), Dr Javed Arshad, diagnostic specialist, FMD Project, FAO, Islamabad (member), Dr Arif Saleem Memon, quarantine officer, (NAPHIS), Karachi (member), Dr Aslam Pervez Umrani, director (CVDL) Hyderabad, Government of Sindh or his representative (member). Later on, Government of Sindh nominated Dr Nazeer Hussain Kalhoro in his place.

The report, a copy of which is available with Business Recorder, says:

...The sheep imported from Australia was originally found a rejected consignment of sheep from Bahrain through MV Ocean Drover ship for M/S PK Livestock and Meat Company, Karachi. The ship left from original port of Australia on 04 Aug 2012 and surprisingly NOC ["No Objection Certificate"] for import of 21 000 sheep was granted by the concerned authority of M/O National Food Security and Research Pakistan on 24 Aug 2012. It seemed that importer has concealed the fact from the Ministry that consignment has been rejected by the veterinary authorities of Bahrain.

The criteria/rules lay down under Pakistan Animal Quarantine (Import and Export of animals and animal products) Act, 1979 and rules 1980 were not fully followed. Standard operating procedures as required under above Act and Rules were violated and not strictly adhered at the time of clearance of consignment by functionaries concerned of the department which are noted as below: Unexpectedly, Certificate of Health bearing No. 612-000891 signed by the authorized Australian veterinary officer on 01 Sep 2012 at Perth, Australia, about 27 days after the ship left the Australia seems to be fake and bogus. Thorough examination and verification of documents (Health Certificate and Commercial Invoice) on board has not been made which is a procedural lapse.

The record reveals that 21 000 sheep were imported, whereas a total number of sheep at the time of embarkation from Australia was necessary to be obtained in order to confirm any mortality during voyage; the same information has not been sought.

Thorough veterinary inspection of these 21 000 sheep on board was very important, sensitive and crucial one and it was beyond the capabilities of only 2 officers to handle such a huge consignment. The proper detailed veterinary inspection on board has not been conducted. If thorough documentary and veterinary inspection on board might had been conducted, then consequences which the country is facing today could have been avoided.

The imported sheep were shifted to the unit of M/S PK Livestock and Meat Co (Pvt) Ltd National Highway, Karachi which was registered with AQD as "slaughter house" for export of meat during the year 2001. The purpose of quarantine was defeated as the imported sheep were kept in slaughter house where other animals were also kept for slaughtering. Director AQD allowed shifting of animals to the unit (slaughter house) of importer on the proposal submitted to him by the quarantine officer. In this case concerned functionaries of the Animal Quarantine Department bluntly violated the provision of Animal Quarantine Act, 1979, and misused the powers of the competent authority of M/O NFS&R who is the sole and exclusive authority to declare any premises as "Quarantine House" for keeping the animals in isolation as required under item-2 clause "k" of Pakistan Animal Quarantine Act 1979.

It is to be noted that the provisional release order bearing No. 5-9/86-AQDP (749) dated: 04 Sep 2012 shows that sheep were released to Government Animal Quarantine House located at National Highway Karachi for test/examination etc, whereas actually the sheep were shifted to the slaughter house of the importer. This committee also practically and physically witnessed the presence of sheep in the premises of importer on 15 Sep 2012 as allowed by the Director AQD, Karachi on the request of the importer. This shows that sheep were not properly quarantined which is serious irresponsibility, violation of law on the part of officers concerned.

Random physical examination of the herd was conducted by the committee member on 15 Sep 2012. No visible clinical signs of any disease were reported by any committee member on that day. However, one of the committee members Dr Aslam Pervaiz Umrani reported on 19 Sep 2012 that he could observe 4 cases of scabby mouth in imported sheep. Another member of committee, Dr Nazeer Hussain Kalhoro, reported that he could witness 3 cases of scabby mouth on 8 Sep 2012 while collecting samples and again observed 7 cases of scabby mouth/orf disease while collecting samples on 19 Sep 2012 and he could photograph some of the cases for evidence. There were conflicting reports of various laboratories however, both of the provincial laboratories constantly reporting the isolation of salmonella, _Escherichia coli_, actinomyces and _Bacillus anthracis_ in dead sheep. However, National Veterinary Laboratory, Islamabad repeatedly found samples negative for all bacteria, FMD, and PPR except once _E. coli_.

Convener of the committee is of opinion that course of disease of anthrax shows very high mortality in the herd even without showing any clinical signs and symptoms, whereas in this sheep herd no such course of disease is observed which minimize the presence of the anthrax. The other members of the committee were of opinion that there might have huge mortality when about 1500 sheep were missing when the premises were under the control of importer.

In view of the rejection of the consignment from the Bahrain authorities, and on the basis of findings by veterinarian officials of Livestock and Fisheries Department Sindh regarding the presence of scabby mouth/orf disease and findings of 2 provincial laboratories, Livestock department Sindh strongly advised Animal Quarantine department to take stern legal and lawful action leading to the destruction of sheep.

In response, animal husbandry commissioner communicated the secretary, Livestock and Fisheries Department, Government of Sindh that this consignment has to be destroyed in the best public interest in merciful manner. The quarantine officer, Karachi handed over 21 000 sheep to the livestock department for merciful destruction through deep burial. The culling of sheep commenced on 17 Sep 2012.

[The Pirbright world reference laboratory reported negative serology of 3 OIE-listed viral, non-zoonotic epizootic diseases, namely foot and mouth disease (FMD), peste des petits ruminants (PPR) and bluetongue (BT). This means that, at least until the date of sampling (during the last week of September?), the consignment had not been infected by these viruses during its lengthy voyage and visits to several harbours (allegedly, Doha, Bahrain, and Fujirah) before arrival in Karachi, nor during its stay, since 4/5 Sep 2012, in Pakistan, a country where all 3 viruses are regarded endemic. Australia is free of FMD and PPR.

According to the report of the Pakistani inquiry committee, the National Veterinary Laboratory, Islamabad, repeatedly found samples negative for all suspected bacteria except once _E. coli_ , as well as for FMD and PPR. The latter finding has now been confirmed by the Pirbright laboratory, which did not (and most probably was not expected to) address other, non-vesicular virus diseases.

No laboratory investigations have, to the best of our understanding, been applied in relation to contagious ecthyma (scabby mouth). On the other hand, according to the inquiry report, 2 of its members observed sporadic cases among the housed sheep, on 8 and 19 Sep 2012; one of them had photographed evidence.

Anticipating the solution of this unfortunate saga, we seem to have returned to square one: see posting 20120917.1297467 ("Contagious ecthyma, sheep - ex Australia: Bahrain, Pakistan") and its commentary.

Contagious ecthyma (orf) is a parapoxvirus infection, distributed globally. This viral skin disease affects sheep, goats and some other domesticated and wild ruminants. The skin lesions are painful and often occur on the mouth and muzzle; hence the other names of the disease, contagious pustular dermatitis, sore mouth and scabby mouth. The lesions are of proliferative nature. Lesions on the udder may result in the abandonment of offspring, and (less common) foot lesions can cause transient lameness. Secondary bacterial infections can occur and, in rare cases, the lesions may extend into the internal organs. Although contagious ecthyma usually resolves spontaneously and the mortality rate is generally low, fatality rates up to 10 per cent have been reported. This is a very common infection of sheep and goats, present in all sheep and/or goat raising countries, globally. In most countries it is not a reportable disease nor cause for movement restrictions; it is not included in the OIE list.

For a collection of contagious ecthyma pictures (12), see http://ksvm.agri.huji.ac.il/yeruham/gallery1_3.php.

Humans are usually infected by direct contact with animal lesions -- for example, children in petting zoos/parks, usually by letting infected lambs licking their fingers. It is not transmitted by consumption of meat or milk; direct contact with lesions being the common infection route. Most infections in humans are localized and heal spontaneously; however, large, poorly healing lesions can occur in people who are immunosuppressed. See pictures at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6114a3.htm.

Contagious ecthyma was the disease that caused the cessation of the live sheep trade from Australia to Saudi Arabia between 1991 and 2001. It is a low grade disease against which Australian sheep bound for Saudi are vaccinated. Despite precautions it is still known to manifest in sheep and goats under stressful conditions.

Orf does not justify stamping out; if science prevails, the consignment is expected to be released for immediate slaughter, before getting exposed to infection in its current, apparently partly bio-secured housing facility, and timely before Eid al Adha, the Moslem Feast of the Sacrifice, which is due to begin in the evening of Thu 25 Oct 2012. - Mod.AS
