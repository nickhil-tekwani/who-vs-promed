The Ancestry of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1
------------------------------------
New research suggests that chimpanzees and human beings each acquired their
versions of the AIDS virus the same way -- by killing and butchering other
primates infected with similar viruses. The prevailing theory of how the
first human got AIDS is that about 75 years ago, someone in central Africa
cut himself while butchering a chimpanzee for food. The animal was infected
with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), which after a few adaptive
mutations evolved into human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in its new host.
This is known in AIDS research circles as the "cut-hunter hypothesis."
A team of European and American scientists offered in today's issue of
Science [Bailes et al., Hybrid Origin of SIV in Chimpanzees, Science 2003
300: 1713] what might be called the "cut-chimpanzee hypothesis" of how that
species acquired SIV, the genetic "father" of HIV. Sometime deep in
prehistory, they say, a chimpanzee killed and consumed two monkeys -- a
red-capped mangabey and a greater spot-nosed monkey -- each infected with
its own particular strain of SIV. Both viruses got into the chimp's
bloodstream, probably through an open wound. This scenario is based on the
researchers' discovery that the virus chimpanzees now carry is a combination
of the mangabey and spot-nosed monkey strains of SIV. For the two strains to
mix and fuse, a chimp would have to be simultaneously infected by both --
and that is likely to happen only through the bloody activity of predation.
The research and its conclusions "emphasize the parallels with the origin of
HIV infection in humans," said Paul Sharp, an evolutionary geneticist at the
University of Nottingham in England. About 30 different African primates
harbor SIV, often with no ill effects, and each species' strain is
different. Genetic analysis shows that chimpanzee SIV -- the closest
relative to the human virus -- had some genes that are similar to the
red-capped mangabey's SIV and others that are like the greater spot-nosed
monkey's SIV. Sharp and his collaborators in France and the United States
attempted to nail down the relationship between the strains. They looked at
4 genes from 8 different species of primate and constructed dozens of
hypothetical family trees for the virus strains. The ones that made the most
sense had the chimpanzee SIV as the product of the fusion of virus strains
from red-capped mangabeys and greater spot-nosed monkeys.
This made geographical sense. One of the 3 subspecies of chimpanzees
that carry SIV occupies the same region of west central Africa near Cameroon
and Gabon as the two other animals. And although they were once thought to
be gentle vegetarians, it is now known that chimps hunt the monkeys for
food. The hybrid scenario requires that at some point an individual chimp
was infected with SIV from both species and that the viruses underwent a
"recombination event," which mixed their genes inside a cell. The new
research adds to the AIDS virus' biography by filling in the story of its
ancestors. Sharp says there is also a lesson of more immediate importance.
It is remotely possible that chimpanzee populations -- which are rare,
scattered and hard to study -- harbor other SIVs capable of infecting human
beings. He and other researchers are looking for them. And they still might
acquire other similar viruses in the future. "It could happen tomorrow,"
Sharp said. Human beings appear to have obtained the AIDS virus from African
primates twice. Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) -- which accounts
for virtually all the cases of AIDS around the world -- came from
chimpanzees. HIV-2, a slightly different strain that is the cause of a very
small number of AIDS cases in west Africa, came from sooty mangabeys.
