In its situation report of 16 Jun 2020, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) confirmed 3 horses on a premises in Butler County, Kansas, as having met the confirmed case definition for the Indiana serotype of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). A 4th horse on the premises also shows clinical signs of muzzle and/or coronary band lesions. All 4 horses began experiencing signs around 9 Jun 2020. No other susceptive livestock species live on the premises. This is Kansas' index case for 2020.

Officials subsequently confirmed VSV on 2 additional Butler County premises. One premises has 3 horses in residence, with all showing clinical signs beginning around 4 Jun 2020, and the 3rd premises has 7 horses, with 1 showing clinical signs beginning around 9 Jun 2020. This premises also contains 3 goats, which are currently unaffected.

None of the premises has had a recent history of animals coming or going.

Veterinarians quarantine and monitor premises with confirmed positive and suspect cases for at least 14 days from the onset of lesions in the last animal affected.

In its 19 Jun 2020 situation report, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) confirmed 2 positive equine premises in Cowley County with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). These are Cowley County's 1st confirmed cases for 2020.

Then, in its 24 Jun [2020] situation report, USDA-APHIS confirmed Sedgwick County's 1st equine premises with VSV. Four premises in the county are affected.

Officials have also confirmed VSV in Butler County (9 new confirmed and 2 new suspect premises) and, since the 19 Jun situation report, 1 new equine premises in Cowley County.

A total of 32 premises in 3 counties are currently under quarantine:

Butler: 25
Cowley: 3
Sedgwick: 4

Veterinarians quarantine and monitor premises with confirmed positive and suspect cases for at least 14 days from the onset of lesions in the last animal affected.

VS 101
Vesicular stomatitis virus can cause blisters and sores in the mouth and on the tongue, muzzle, teats, or hooves of horses, cattle, swine, sheep, goats, llamas, and a number of other animals. Lesions usually heal in 2-3 weeks.

Because of the virus' contagious nature and its resemblance to other diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease, animal health officials urge livestock owners and caretakers to report these signs to their veterinarian immediately. Most animals recover with supportive care by a veterinarian.

"Vesicular stomatitis has been conÔ¨Årmed only in the Western Hemisphere," APHIS said on its website. "It is known to be an endemic disease in the warmer regions of North, Central, and South America, and outbreaks of the disease in other temperate geographic parts of the hemisphere occur sporadically. The Southwestern and Western United States have experienced a number of vesicular stomatitis outbreaks. Outbreaks usually occur during the warmer months, occasionally along waterways."

According to Angela Pelzel McCluskey, DVM, APHIS' equine epidemiologist, the largest VS outbreak in more than 40 years of recorded history occurred in 2019.

Some states and other countries might restrict movement of, or impose additional requirements for, susceptible animals from states having known VS cases. Before moving livestock, contact the state of destination for its requirements.

The Nebraska Department of Agriculture (NDA) has confirmed a case of vesicular stomatitis (VS) in a horse in Buffalo County, and the horse has been quarantined. One additional horse on the premises is also exhibiting symptoms, therefore all animals on the infected premises will be quarantined for at least 14 days.

VS is a viral disease that primarily affects horses and cattle, but can also affect sheep, goats, and swine, the press release added.

"Vesicular Stomatitis is primarily transmitted through the bite of infected black flies, sand flies, and midges," said State Veterinarian Dr. Dennis Hughes. "There are things livestock owners can do to reduce flies and other insects where animals are housed, but until freezing temperatures move in and kill the insects that spread the virus, VS will continue to be a threat in Nebraska."

Hughes added, "Since VS can also spread by contact between animals and by shared equipment, like tools or tack, we want livestock owners to be aware and practice good biosecurity measures with their animals, particularly with animals that may comingle with others."

Nebraska has import restrictions for livestock coming into the state from states that have confirmed VS cases to help prevent VS.

If you are considering moving an animal into Nebraska from an affected state, please call 402-471-2351.

"The virus itself usually runs its course in 5-7 days, and it can take up to an additional 7 days for an infected animal to recover from the symptoms," said Hughes.

To avoid human exposure, people should use personal protective measures when handling affected animals.

[While the serotype in the 1st article regarding Kansas is reported as being the Indiana serotype, it is likely the others mentioned in article 2 of this update are also the Indiana serotype. However, we are not told what is circulating in Nebraska.

Generally, this disease departs with killing frost, likely as insect vectors die off. At this point, I am sure all producers and regulators are ready for a frost, which is a long time from June in most parts of the affected areas. - Mod.TG
