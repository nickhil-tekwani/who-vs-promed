A cat in Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania has tested positive for rabies. We're told a family in who lives on Metztown Road in Brady Township took their unvaccinated farm cat to a veterinary clinic after they say it started to act restless and panting. The veterinarian told them to keep the cat contained, but the next day, the cat escaped the enclosure they had it in and bit a child.

At that point, the cat was euthanized and submitted for rabies tests. They came back positive. Several people are receiving post exposure treatment for rabies.

Pennsylvania law requires all dogs and non-feral cats 3 months of age and older to be vaccinated against rabies. Booster vaccinations must be administered periodically to maintain lifelong immunity. Failure to comply with the law may result in a fine of up to USD 300.

If you encounter an animal that you suspect may have rabies, contact your local law enforcement or local Pennsylvania Game Commission office. Your regional Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture office can provide guidance for safely preparing and submitting the animal for rabies testing. If you may have been exposed to the rabies virus, seek medical attention.

A groundhog captured in Doylestown after "a series of aggressive encounters" has tested positive for rabies, Doylestown Borough officials confirmed Friday [5 Aug 2016]. The groundhog, which had the aggressive encounters with both humans and pets, was captured in the vicinity of Church and Mechanic streets earlier this week, according to information from Doylestown Borough.

The Bucks County Department of Health notified Doylestown Borough officials of the positive test this week.

Authorities advise if you or your pets had an encounter with an aggressive groundhog, contact your family physician or veterinarian "immediately."

Further details on the aggressive encounters or how many were reported were not immediately available.

At least 5 people were potentially exposed to rabies by a puppy that tested positive for the disease in Chesnee, the Department of Health and Environmental Control [DHEC] reported today [5 Aug 2016].

The puppy was a Germany Shepherd-mix that was being sold at Burr's Trading Post on Old Stage Road on 20 Jun 2016 from an individual not affiliated with the store. The puppy began to show neurological symptoms at the end of July 2016 and was submitted to DHEC's laboratory for testing on 1 Aug 2016.

DHEC said several other puppies were for sale.

DHEC recommends that anyone who obtained or was exposed to a puppy there around this time should watch the animal for signs and symptoms of rabies and immediately seek veterinary care if the animal becomes ill. DHEC said signs and symptoms can include lethargy, fever, vomiting, weakness, not wanting to eat, aggression, abnormal behavior, difficulty walking, difficulty breathing, and difficulty swallowing.

If you have a question or concern about possible exposure, please contact DHEC's Environmental Health Services Spartanburg office at (864) 596-3327.

According to DHEC, 5 people have been potentially exposed to rabies by a puppy that tested positive near Chesnee.

The dog, a German Shepherd mix puppy, was bought from a person outside the Burr's Trading Post on Old Stage Road in Chesnee in June 2016. The person was also selling other puppies. DHEC is recommending anyone who obtained or was exposed to a puppy there to watch the animal for signs and symptoms of rabies and immediately seek veterinary care if the dog becomes ill.

If you believe you bought any of these puppies and it died or you don't have it anymore, please contact your health care provider about possible exposure to rabies.
