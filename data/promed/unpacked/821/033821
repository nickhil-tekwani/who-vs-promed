Mosquitoes collected in Anaheim and Westminster have tested positive for St. Louis encephalitis, the 1st occurrence in those cities in 3 decades, Orange County officials announced Tuesday [15 Oct 2019].

The mosquitoes were collected late last week along Old Bolsa Chica Road in Westminster and near Dale and Orange avenues in Anaheim, according to Heather Hyland of the Orange County Mosquito and Vector Control District.

The last time any St. Louis encephalitis-positive mosquitoes were found in those areas was 1987, according to the district. Mosquitoes testing positive for the virus were found in 2017 near the vector control offices in Garden Grove, the agency said.

Most people bitten by a St. Louis encephalitis-infected mosquito do not become ill, but those who do will experience symptoms such as fever, headache, nausea, vomiting and fatigue. Older adults can experience inflammation of the brain, and, in rare cases, a person can sustain a long-term disability or die.

The last time anyone in Orange County was afflicted with the virus was in the fall of 1984. There were 6 positive samples St. Louis encephalitis in mosquitoes from 1984 through 1987 in the county.

Vector control officials encouraged residents to dump any standing water around their homes to stymie breeding grounds for the insects.

[St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) has shown up in mosquitoes in 2 Orange County cities after a 3 decades-long absence. Cases of SLE virus-caused encephalitis occur sporadically in southern California and adjoining southwestern states, so the 2 cases this year (2019) in southern California reported earlier this year in nearby Imperial County are not surprising (see St Louis encephalitis virus - USA: (CA) 20190823.663634).

In 2015, human cases occurred in the adjoining states of Nevada and Arizona, and positive mosquitoes were found in California. SLE virus was found in mosquitoes in Nevada in 2005. The virus also is found in the southeastern USA with occasional incursions into the midwestern states. The USA Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates that less than 1% of St Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) infections are clinically apparent, and the vast majority of infections remain undiagnosed (https://www.cdc.gov/sle/technical/symptoms.html).

Wild birds are the SLE virus reservoir hosts, and mosquitoes in the genus _Culex_ are the vectors that transmit SLE virus. The mosquito species in which SLEV was detected are not mentioned in the above report.
