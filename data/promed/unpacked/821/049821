In the ongoing debate regarding the origin of the
European BTV 8, we would like to make the following comments.
We have amplified the complete genomes of all 16
South African BTV vaccine strains and partially
sequenced the VP2 segments (published). We have
completed the nucleotide sequencing of the VP2
segments of all vaccine strains (serotypes 1-14,
16 and 19) and the remaining reference strains
(manuscript in preparation). From this study we
can confirm what was said by Prof. Mertens about
the relatedness of the BTV 8 vaccine and
reference strains. These strains have almost
identical nucleotide sequences and dsRNA PAGE
profiles. [For Prof Mertens' views, see section
2 in "Bluetongue - Netherlands, Belgium, Germany
(08): BTV-8 origin 20060915.2615". - ModAS]
In a recent study we have also amplified the
complete genomes of more than 130 South African
BTV isolates (multiple serotypes) from 1986 to
2003. We have partially sequenced the VP2
segments and have identified 8 vaccine and 4 BTV
8 isolates. Therefore we have some sequence information on "western" BTV8.
Following the news of the European outbreak we
have prepared our BTV 8 virus isolates as well as
some bovine isolates from 1996 (this was one of
the only years we had disease in cattle caused by
BTV). Among the cattle isolates there are also
BTV 8 serotypes. We will be amplifying the
complete genomes shortly and sequencing selected
segments for comparison to the European strains.
If we can initiate cooperation, or if the BTV
strain from Europe is made available to our BTV
OIE Reference Centre, we can compare it to the S.A. isolates.

by EFSA Epidemiology Working Group;Bulletin 13, 19 Jan 2007 [edited].

Outbreak Period until 18 January, 2007: Main Observation
----------------------------------------------
The current bluetongue serotype 8 epidemic is now
into its 23rd week, with the case total having
risen to 2073 herds. Out of the 2072 cases with
correct georeferences, 695 cases were reported
from Belgium, 6 from France, 905 from Germany,
458 from the Netherlands, and 7 from Luxembourg.
[See additional data in commentary].
During the last 3 weeks new cases have continued
to be reported at a low level. This week's 8 new
cases occurred in cattle at the fringe of the
area known to be affected thus far. Most of the
new cases were detected through clinical case
reporting, but some were detected by serological
investigations prior to movements between zones
within Member States or between Member States.
Relative to the number of farms, the 2 areas that
have been most severely affected in 2006 are the
original cluster of cases where Belgium, Germany,
and the Netherlands share borders and the
Bergisches Land region of Germany. The latter is
not a cattle-dense region but now represents the
cluster with the largest spatial extent. However,
during 2006 the virus has also spread into or
close to areas with high cattle density in
Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands.

According to the data included in table 1 of the
full report, "Number of cases reported by country
and by animal species affected", 8 new cases --
all in cattle -- have been reported through 18
Jan for the period between 12 and 18 Jan 2007 (7 in Germany, 1 in Luxembourg).
Out of the total 2072 fully documented BTV-8
outbreaks recorded since the beginning of the
panzootic in August/September 2006, 1062 involved
cattle, 951 small ruminants, 13 wild species and
46 mixed herds (herds including more than one susceptible species).
The continued occurrence of clinical cases during
the peak winter season is most unusual; for
clarification, entomological and epidemiological
research is required. - Mod.AS]
