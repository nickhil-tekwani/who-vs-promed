A Kangaroo Island group says it is likely Ovine Johnes Disease (OJD) will
have spread from a stud at Mount Bryan - a prime merino district in the Mid
North. The Primary Industries department is investigating the source and
extent of the new infection, at the Woolana stud near Burra.
Doctor Greg Johnsson from the Kangaroo Island OJD Committee says island
producers will be relieved by the discovery, as it confirms OJD is not
restricted to high-rainfall areas.
"It seems as if from the information that's come out about this infection
that it's an endemic infection because it's an old home-bred sheep that's
come up with fairly advanced lesions," Dr Johnsson said.
"That would suggest that the infection has been on that property for some
time which increases the likelihood of spread of the disease to the
neighbours of that property in particular and also to people that have
traded with that property.
"For 12 months now we've really borne the brunt of attitude about the
island and OJD and the potential for Kangaroo Island to infect the mainland
and so on and so forth.
"I think that at last we might be actually starting to see that this
disease is not restricted to Kangaroo Island and is likely to be spread
throughout the State," he said.
Meanwhile, no decisions are being made yet about what to do with the
Woolana stud's infected flock.
The State's chief veterinarian, Doctor Robin Vandegraaff, says any decision
about compulsory de-stocking will wait until after random checks for OJD on
400 properties around South Australia.
"Concentrating in the high rainfall districts of the State, that survey is
about to commence and is scheduled to be finished within 3 or 4 months so
that we can move forward to make a more informed policy decision about
whether the State should go ahead with eradication by depopulation on
infected properties," Dr Vandegraaff said.
