[1] Liberia: Ebola crisis - Confusion as patients vanish

There are conflicting reports over the fate of 17 suspected patients with Ebola virus disease (EVD) who vanished after a quarantine area in the Liberian capital was looted. An angry mob attacked the center in Monrovia's densely populated West Point township on Saturday [15 Aug 2015] evening. A senior health official said all of the patients had been moved to another medical facility, but a reporter told the BBC that 17 had escaped and 10 others were taken away by their families. Assistant Health Minister Tolbert Nyenswah said protesters had been unhappy because patients were being brought in from other parts of the capital. Other reports suggested the protesters believed EVD was a hoax and wanted to force the quarantine center to close. The attack at the Monrovia center is seen as a major setback in the struggle to halt the outbreak, according to a BBC reporter in Lagos... - more

Summary as of 16 Aug 2015
-----------------------
There were 3 confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) reported in the week to 16 Aug 2015, all of which were reported from Guinea. For the 1st time since the beginning of the outbreak in Sierra Leone, a full epidemiological week has passed with no confirmed cases reported from the country. Overall case incidence has held at 3 confirmed cases per week for 3 consecutive weeks. In addition, the number of contacts under observation has halved from over 1600 on 9 Aug 2015 to approximately 800 throughout 3 Guinean prefectures and 3 districts in Sierra Leone on 16 Aug 2015.

Almost 600 contacts in Tonkolili, Sierra Leone, completed the 21-day follow-up period on 14 Aug 2015, accounting for most of the decline in the number of contacts under follow-up. However, there is still a significant risk of further transmission. In addition to the large number of contacts who remain under observation in Guinea and Sierra Leone, 45 contacts have been lost to follow-up in the Guinean capital Conakry over the past 6 weeks. Several high-risk contacts have also been lost to follow-up in the Sierra Leonean capital, Freetown. Rapid-response teams remain alert and ready to respond to further cases.

All of the 3 confirmed cases reported from Guinea in the week to 16 Aug 2015 are registered contacts and are now receiving treatment in Ebola treatment centres. Two cases were reported from the Matam area of the capital, Conakry. Both cases were relatives and registered contacts of the single case reported from the Ratoma area of the city in the previous week (week ending 9 Aug 2015). The remaining case was reported from the sub-prefecture of Moussayah in Forecariah. The case is a relative and registered contact of the case reported from the same sub-prefecture during the previous week. The origin of the previous week's case remains under investigation; 796 contacts remain under follow-up in 3 western prefectures in Guinea (Conakry, Coyah, and Forecariah), compared with 927 contacts in 4 prefectures the previous week. All contacts previously under observation in the prefecture of Kindia have now completed the 21-day follow-up period.

No new cases were reported from Liberia in the week to 16 Aug 2015. All contacts in Liberia have now completed their 21-day follow-up period. The last 2 patients with EVD in Liberia were discharged after completing treatment and testing negative for EVD for a 2nd time on 23 Jul 2015.

No cases were reported from Sierra Leone in the week to 16 Aug 2015: the 1st week without a reported case since the onset of the outbreak in the country. A total of 72 contacts remain under follow-up across 3 districts (Tonkolili, Western Area Urban and Western Area Rural), all of whom are associated with the Western Area Urban (Freetown) chain of transmission. All contacts associated with the recent cluster of cases in Tonkolili will complete the 21-day follow-up period on 23 Aug 2015.

For the 3rd consecutive week, no health worker infections were reported from any of the affected countries. There have been a total of 880 confirmed health worker infections reported from Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone since the start of the outbreak, with 512 reported deaths.

Countries with Widespread and Intense Transmission
----------------------------------
There have been a total of 27 952 reported confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of EVD in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone (figure 1, table 1) up to 16 Aug 2015, with 11 284 reported deaths (this total includes reported deaths among probable and suspected cases, although outcomes for many cases are unknown); 3 new confirmed cases were reported in Guinea in the week to 16 Aug 2015.

The total number of confirmed cases is similar in males and females (table 2). Compared with children (people aged 14 years and under), adults aged 15-44 are approximately 4 times more likely to be affected in Guinea and Liberia, and 3 times more likely to be affected in Sierra Leone.

No new health worker infections were reported in the week to 16 Aug 2015. Since the start of the outbreak, a total of 880 confirmed health worker infections have been reported in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone; there have been 512 reported deaths (table 5).

[5] Sierra Leone: How to support girls in post-Ebola Sierra Leone
Date: 17 Aug 2015
Source: World Economic Forum Agenda [edited]
https://agenda.weforum.org/2015/08/how-to-support-girls-in-post-ebola-sierra-leone/


While schools have re-opened in Sierra Leone, only a small number of students have actually come back to class. Some are working to support their families. Others are taking care of younger siblings. Some are deceased. But there is one population that is disproportionately missing: girls, especially pregnant girls. The Ministry of Education in Sierra Leone has banned girls who are "visibly" pregnant from taking the standardized exams that are needed to graduate, justifying this decision by saying pregnant girls "always fail" these exams. These girls are also not allowed to attend class, as officials believe it may have a negative influence on other girls. Even the First Lady of Sierra Leone, Sia Nyama Koroma, a well-known spokesperson for children's rights, also endorsed the pregnancy ban.

Yet, girls who get an education are more likely to escape poverty and live more productive lives. We know that educated women are more likely to ensure that their own children are educated. We also know that educated women are more likely to have fewer children. Given the poor economic state of Sierra Leone, it is an urgent priority to educate everyone, but girls and women are especially in need due to their increased risk factors and marginalization.

17 Aug 2015 Sierra Leone: down to the last chain of Ebola virus transmission
http://goo.gl/QfccPU
[The country's use of rapid response teams and strong community efforts in finding Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases and contacts is showing results. An epidemiological week has now passed with no new EVD cases for the 1st time since the beginning of the outbreak. Now in phase 3, the EVD response is focusing on tracking each and every chain of Ebola virus transmission and closing down the remaining chains as quickly as possible. Sierra Leone is now down to a single chain of transmission. In addition to the index case, 2 more people (both of them from the young man's family) tested positive for EVD. They were treated at an Ebola Treatment Center which had been on standby and run by International Medical Corps (IMC). There, they were cared for by a team that included EVD survivors, who provided much of the physical and psychological care they needed. Both of the remaining cases are now recovering.]

[According to New York Fire Department officials (FDNY), on Wednesday (19 Aug 2015) a person who recently visited West Africa was rushed to Bellevue Hospital with Ebola-like symptoms, FDNY officials said. According to a spokesperson, the patient was suffering from symptoms associated with Ebola virus disease (EVD), including returning from recent travel in Guinea, and fit the FDNY's "criteria for fever travel." The patient was taken to the hospital by paramedics, and a command post had been set up at Bellevue hospital, with hazmat and decontamination units...more]

Control

18 Aug 2015: Quick, paper-based Ebola test may help in remote areas
http://consumer.healthday.com/infectious-disease-information-21/misc-infections-news-411/researchers-develop-paper-based-ebola-test-702115.html
[A paper-based testing device can quickly diagnose Ebola virus disease (EVD), yellow fever, or dengue fever. Once the blood sample is placed on the paper strip in the device, within minutes the paper changes to a specific color to indicate whether a person has Ebola virus disease (EVD), dengue fever or yellow fever. The test works in a similar manner to over-the-counter pregnancy tests. The components of the device will be given to people for free in free kits so they can build the device themselves. Their plan is to get the device into the field and to people who need it. While lab tests are more accurate, they require technical expertise, expensive equipment, transport to a lab facility, and often need refrigeration to keep the drawn blood specimen cooled. With this paper test device, people with EVD in remote areas can be quickly identified and placed in quarantine. The device was developed by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard Medical School, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.]
