The district civil hospital in Sector 6 is overwhelmed with patients complaining of high-grade fever, with doctors at a loss about the cause.

Beds in the hospital's emergency wing are fully occupied, forcing staff to start accommodating 2 patients on one bed. Doctors say the patients are presenting with fever over 101 deg F [38.3 deg C], severe body ache, painful eyes, bleeding, and low platelet count.

Amid the burgeoning cases, the hospital authorities have approached PGIMER for help. "We have requested the head of the PGIMER epidemiology department to send teams here to establish the reason behind this sudden rise in fever cases," said chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Mukta Kumar.

Dr Mankirat, spokesperson for the CMO, said currently 42 patients having high-grade fever were admitted at the hospital. "As many as 80% of the patients arriving at the Internal Medicine OPD, which receives a footfall of around 800 patients a day, have high fever," the official said.

A doctor not wishing to be named said, "Of the total patients arriving in the OPD, we are admitting those who have bleeding complications, like nasal bleeding or blood in urine, platelet count less than 20 000, or low blood pressure, all symptoms of dengue shock syndrome."

The district has recorded 367 confirmed cases of dengue so far this year [2022] -- highest in the tricity -- and one patient has also succumbed to the disease. But the health department's data does not reflect deaths due to high-grade fever.

An expert from PGIMER said, "There could be multiple reasons behind the fever. It could be caused by a tropical disease, dengue, scrub typhus, viral infection, or viral haemorrhagic fevers. We will have to check all clinical parameters to diagnose the disease(s), for which a number of tests will have to be conducted."

PGIMER, however, has not witnessed any sudden rise in such cases. Dr RR Sharma, head of blood transfusion department, said, "We are getting 10-12 demands for platelets daily, which is higher than August, but quite less compared to this time last year [2021], when the demand was as high as 100 a day."

UT director, health services, Dr Suman Singh, said Chandigarh's government hospitals were also receiving fever cases, but the figure was similar to past trends and not alarming.

[This report is confusing. It indicates that the febrile cases have low platelet counts without an etiological diagnosis and suggests that tropical disease, dengue, scrub typhus, viral infection, or viral hemorrhagic fevers (such as Nipah virus infection) might be responsible. Yet it also indicates that the district has recorded 367 confirmed cases of dengue so far this year [2022], implying that the dengue outbreak is ongoing, but does not indicate if this dengue outbreak is related to the febrile cases they are seeing. The clinical picture for the febrile cases is compatible with dengue. Clearly, laboratory tests are needed to establish the diagnosis, followed by epidemiological studies to determine if there are febrile cases that are not coming to the local hospitals and to identify the situation where the pathogens are being encountered and transmission is occurring. - Mod.TY]
