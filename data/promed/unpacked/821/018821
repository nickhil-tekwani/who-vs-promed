Computer Modeling Suggests Global Influenza Pandemic is Stoppable
-----------------------------------------------
UK and US teams used computer models to work out the possible
scenarios that could occur if the H5N1 avian influenza virus mutated
and became capable of spreading from human to human. The result could
be deaths on the scale of the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic that claimed
between 20 and 40 million lives. However, surveillance plus targeted
use of anti-viral drugs could halt it, they told Nature and Science
journals.
The models used by both teams looked at Thailand, one of the places
at highest risk from avian influenza. More than 50 people have died
from bird flu in southeast Asia since the 1st human cases were
reported in 1997.
At present, H5N1 avian influenza poses only a limited threat to
humans, as it cannot be easily spread from person to person. But
experts fear the H5N1 virus may acquire this ability, causing an
influenza pandemic that could kill as many as 50 000 people in the
UK. Looking at this scenario, Professor Neil Ferguson of Imperial
College London and his colleagues found 2 key conditions would have
to be met to limit an outbreak of human-transmissible avian influenza
to fewer than 200 cases. Firstly, the virus would have to be
identified while confined to about 30 people, they told "Nature." In
addition, antiviral drugs would have to be distributed rapidly to the
20 000 individuals nearest those infected. [The Imperial College
group] estimated that an international stockpile of 3 million courses
of the treatment would be enough to contain an outbreak. But it would
mean having to deploy the drug anywhere in the world at short notice.
Professor Ferguson said: "It's an enormous undertaking and will
require cooperation among governments on a large scale."
Another team from Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, led by Dr.
Ira Longini, simulated an outbreak in a population of 500 000 in
rural Thailand, with people mixed in a variety of settings, including
households, schools, workplaces and a hospital. Provided targeted use
of antiviral drugs was adopted within 21 days, it would be possible
to contain an outbreak, they found, as long as each infected person
was not likely to infect more than an average of 1.6 people. If there
was more infectivity than this, household quarantines would also be
necessary, they said. Co-researcher Elizabeth Halloran said: "Our
findings indicate that we have reason to be somewhat hopeful. If --
or, more likely, when -- an outbreak occurs in humans, there is a
chance of containing it and preventing a pandemic. She told "Science"
journal that early intervention could at least slow the pandemic,
helping to reduce mortality until a well-matched vaccine could be
produced.
The World Health Organization said the models would help to improve
pandemic influenza preparedness planning. A spokesman said: "Several
countries have already purchased stockpiles of antiviral drugs, and
WHO has taken steps to establish an international stockpile. National
and international stockpiles of antiviral drugs may be an essential
component of comprehensive international pandemic preparedness that
also includes vaccine development and disease surveillance."

[While this analysis is encouraging, Thailand may not have been the
best model. Thailand has been relatively successful in controlling
avian disease, and the majority of the human cases and deaths have
occurred in Viet Nam. There have been no human cases or deaths in
Thailand since the end of 2004, compared with 60 cases and 18 deaths
during the same period in Viet Nam - Mod.CP]
