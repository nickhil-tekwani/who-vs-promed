Potato wart discovery prompts U.S. to shut out P.E.I. shipments
----------------------------------------------------------------
The U.S. Department of Agriculture closed [its border Tuesday to all
shipments of potatoes from [P.E.I. until further notice [because of the
discovery of [the fungal disease, potato wart. The disease, which produces
ugly outgrowth[s on potato [tubers and renders [them unmarketable, was
found last week [during harvesting operations of a processing crop in a
single field in the New Annan area.
Word of the U.S. prohibition reached officials of the Prince Edward Island.
potato industry late Tuesday afternoon via the Canadian Food Inspection
Agency. "We were caught completely by surprise," Ivan Noonan, general
manager of the P.E.I. Potato Board, said Tuesday night. [According to
Noonan, everything that could possibly be done to contain the situation had
been done. The field has been isolated and a trace-back is in progress. The
disease is confined to 1 acre in a corner of a 60-acre field.
Agriculture Minister Mitch Murphy said [that 400 soil samples have been
taken from that field and sent to a laboratory [at St. John's, NF that is
recognized as the top lab in [Canada for this disease.
The U.S. buys [about 10 percent of the P.E.I. crop. Last year,
approximately 2.5 million hundredweight of P.E.I. potatoes [were exported
to the U.S.A. .

[Hopefully exports to the United States will be resumed once the
distribution of the pathogen is known in P.E.I. and U.S.D.A. officials are
satisfied that there is minimal risk to potato production by importing
potatoes from P.E.I. into the U.S.A. That may be a tall order. - Mod.DH
