I am replying as the doctor quoted in the second article on
meningococcal disease in Northern Ireland. This is a very bad piece
of reporting that totally misquotes me and misunderstands the
situation. The reporter has confused group C meningococcus with
overall meningococcal disease. He has also compared 2 years that both
occurred after the introduction of the vaccine and after we saw an
overall fall in cases. In fact, neither the death nor the other cases
that he attributes to group C were caused by it.
We have seen the same dramatic effect of meningococcal C vaccine here
as has been seen in the rest of the UK. In the 3 years before the
vaccine was introduced, we had a total of 20 confirmed cases of C
(in a population of about 280 000), whereas in the 3 years after the
complete introduction of the vaccine, we have seen only 1 confirmed
case. Group B cases have in contrast remained fairly static.
I am taking up the issue with the newspaper and reporter concerned,
but in the meantime would be most grateful if you could correct the
situation for your readers so that they are not misled.

From: Ronald Gold <ronald.gold@sympatico.ca>

A much more likely explanation of the incidence of meningococcal
disease in the UK and Ireland is the fact that the group C vaccine,
whether pure polysaccharide or conjugate, is effective only against
group C strains. There is no evidence of decreased efficacy of the
group C vaccine. Indeed, the incidence of group C disease has dropped
dramatically in the vaccinated age groups in England and Wales. The
overall incidence has not declined, however, because the incidence of
group B disease has increased.
