[2] Genetic changes in Ebola virus
Date: Tue 20 Jan 2015
Source: MedicalXpress [edited]
http://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-01-genetic-ebola-virus-west-african.html


Researchers have tracked the genetic mutations that have occurred in the Ebola virus during the last 4 decades. Their findings identified changes in the current West African outbreak strain that could potentially interfere with experimental, sequence-based therapeutics. The work highlights the genetic changes that could affect these sequence-based drugs that were originally designed in the early 2000's based on virus strains from outbreaks in 1976 and 1995.

The team compared the entire genomic sequence of the current outbreak strain, called EBOV/Mak, with 2 other Ebola virus variants, one from an outbreak in Yambuku, Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo) in 1976 called EBOV/Yam-May, and one from an outbreak in Kikwit, Zaire in 1995 called EBOV/Kik-9510621. They found changes, called single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs, in more than 600 spots, or about 3 percent of the genome.

Sequence-based drugs currently offer the best hope for future treatment of Ebola outbreaks but have not yet been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration or any other regulatory agency. Because the World Health Organization adopted emergency containment measures for the ongoing West African outbreak, these drugs are currently being used to treat a few handfuls of patients in experimental testing. A clinical trial for one of the therapies will begin in Sierra Leone in the coming months.

The team narrowed their search to only those mutations that changed the genetic sequences targeted by the various drugs. Of those, they found 10 new mutations that might interfere with the actions of monoclonal antibody, siRNA (small-interfering RNA), or PMO (phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer) drugs currently being tested. Three of the mutations the team found appeared during the ongoing West African epidemic. "Ebola researchers need to assess drug efficacy in a timely manner to make sure that valuable resources are not spent developing therapies that no longer work... - more]

[3] Diagnosing Ebola
Date: Wed 14 Jan 2015
Source: Wellcome Trust [edited]
http://blog.wellcome.ac.uk/2015/01/14/diagnosing-ebola-a-day-in-the-life-of-a-diagnostics-lab-in-sierra-leone

Leaving his lab in Cambridge, Professor Ian Goodfellow headed to Sierra Leone with the NGO International Medical Corps to join a team putting together a diagnostic lab in Makeni, Sierra Leone. Creating a diagnostic facility in this area was key to speeding up diagnoses. When the diagnostic lab opened, a rotation was set up to stagger the number of people in lab to cover the 6 am-10 pm opening times. Team members would start their shifts at 6 am, 8 am, 11 am and 2 pm, with the late shift staying until everything had been completed. A typical shift lasted around 8 hours.

5:30 am: Wake up and brave a cold shower. Don't forget to take anti-malarial, take temperature (36.3 C). Arrive at Ebola Treatment Centre (ETC). Wash hands with bleach, have temperature taken and answer questions to check health status. Boots sprayed with bleach before entry to the ETC. Pass through changing room, don scrubs and wellington boots.

Approx. 6:10 am: Arrive at the lab and unlock it, put on cloth gown, 2 pairs of gloves and goggles. Mop floors, swab benches and empty buckets from the previous day. Inspect the isolators, which are used to work with Ebola positive samples; clean them out and set up for the day ahead. Check all the stock items in the lab

Approx. 8:00 am: The 2nd shift arrives. Discuss the results from the previous day. How many positives were there? Did anything go wrong? Did all the reagents behave as they should?

Approx. 8:30-11:00 am: The 1st set of the day's samples turn up. Don additional plastic aprons and face shields for handing and sorting incoming samples. The paperwork is brought into the lab and wiped down with bleach. Samples are put into a large isolator. One of the team opens the sample pots in the isolator and inspects the bags without touching anything inside. Count the total number of samples and compare to the number of sample request forms received. One by one carefully remove each sample from its packaging and wipe it down with bleach inside the isolator. Check details of sample against the sample request forms. Label samples with a unique lab identifier and arrange into batches of samples for processing. Samples are wrapped in 2 individually sealed bags, wiped down with bleach, and after 10 minutes, they can be moved to a 2nd isolator where the nucleic acid extraction takes place.

Approx. 11:00 am-1:00 pm: Inside the 2nd isolator, carefully extract nucleic acid from an aliquot of the patient's blood or swab. Run malaria tests if required. Once the samples have been inactivated with extraction buffer and ethanol, wipe down the tubes with bleach and wait 10 minutes before bringing them out.

Approx 1:00 pm-2:00 pm: Bring inactivated samples out of the isolator and carry out final checks to ensure the inactivation times are correct. Extract nucleic acid on the bench. Purify viral RNA genome from other things present in samples. This process takes around 40 minutes, and the final product is a small amount of purified nucleic acid.

Approx, 2:00-4:00 pm: Analyse the samples using the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) on one of the 3 PCR machines. Complete the paperwork and enter the results into a database. (Depending on where the samples had come from, the results would either be reported later that night or immediately phoned through to clinical staff. The typical turnaround times were 4-5 hours from sample reception to results, which -- given the critical safety steps that had to be followed -- was pretty quick.)

Approx. 8:30 pm: One team leader sends out a report of the day to the various agencies involved. We had satellite based internet, but it was somewhat temperamental. One particular evening, it took almost 2 hours to send the report out due to these connectivity problems.

Approx. 10:00 pm: Close down the lab at the end of the day, cleaning out all the isolators, discarding all the waste, swabbing down the benches with bleach and generally trying to prepare the lab for the team in the morning.
