Low-Pathogenic Avian Flu Reported in 3 US States
------------------------------------------------
Low-pathogenic H5 avian influenza has been found in live-bird markets in Pennsylvania, New York, and New Jersey.

According to CIDRAP, the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, the outbreaks were 1st reported in foreign media due to bilateral agreements to report such disease between the US and some trading partners.

CIDRAP said the outbreaks were later confirmed by Joelle Hayden, a public affairs specialist with the US Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), who said finding low pathogenic avian influenza isn't uncommon in backyard flocks and live-bird markets.

Live bird markets mix birds from different areas, offering the opportunity for the bird flu virus to adapt and spread.

[The United States has an active surveillance program for monitoring H5 and H7 avian influenza subtypes in live bird markets. For specific information on this program, see https://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/animal_dis_spec/poultry/downloads/lbms_program_standards_final.pdf. It was through this program that the 1st cases of low pathogenic H5 avian influenza were detected in these markets. - Mod.CRD
