Greek yogurt maker Chobani has landed in hot water after customers complained over a foul taste and reported feeling ill after eating Chobani yogurts that reportedly contained mold. Chobani notified retailers Friday, 30 Aug 2013, telling them to pull 15 flavors. It did not issue a formal recall, however. Instead, it has been responding to customer complaints via its Facebook page, asking people to email the company.

The (Portland) Oregonian said customers complained their yogurt tasted odd and some containers were bloated. Those who consumed the yogurt complained of vomiting and diarrhea. Chobani's Facebook page is filled with testimonials from irate customers who are calling for a boycott, and some commenters are saying their posts have already been deleted.

According to Amy Juaristi, a Chobani spokeswoman, the affected yogurts are only those made in one of Chobani's facilities in Idaho. The recalled products are only 5 percent of Chobani's overall production. The yogurt maker is working with its retailers to eliminate certain yogurts from grocery shelves. These cups are those labeled with the code 16-012 and those whose expiration dates range from 11 Sep to 7 Oct 2013. Chobani has not yet stated how many cups or varieties have been contaminated. Juaristi did not say where the tainted yogurt was sold.

Meanwhile, the Food and Drug Administration has been notified, though it rarely orders a product recall. Instead, the FDA usually orders companies to contact stores to remove the products and to make the public aware of any suspected problems.

Randy Worobo is a professor of Food Science in Cornell University's College of Agriculture and Life Sciences and a leading expert on food spoilage and microbial food safety and quality. He comments on the announcement of a voluntary recall by Chobani of some Greek yogurt products due to reports of mold contamination.

Worobo says: "_Mucor circinelloides_ is a species of mold commonly associated with fruits, vegetables and dairy [products] that has been reported to cause spoilage like swelling and bloating in yogurt. It is not considered a disease-causing foodborne microorganism. This mold should not pose a health risk to most consumers. Very rarely, it can act as an opportunistic pathogen, but not through food and usually only for people with compromised immune systems through inhalation. The organism is regularly used for the production of natural flavor compounds that are widely used in the food industry."

[It is not entirely clear how the mold identified was related to the gastrointestinal illnesses reported and what the overall incidence of the symptoms were.

_Mucor circinelloides_ is a rare cause of human mucormycosis (zygomycosis), a fungal infection that generally manifests in diabetics or in immunocompromised individuals. In one report (Khan ZU, Ahmad S, Brazda A, Chandy R: _Mucor circinelloides_ as a cause of invasive maxillofacial zygomycosis: an emerging dimorphic pathogen with reduced susceptibility to posaconazole.
J Clin Microbiol 2009;47: 1244-1248), the authors state (citation numbers removed):

"A review of the literature revealed only 8 cases of zygomycosis in adults caused by _M. circinelloides_. Six of the cases with cutaneous or subcutaneous involvement were either known or suspected to have sustained trauma. Hematological malignancy was the underlying disease in 4 cases (acute myelocytic leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome in 2 patients each); one had multiple underlying conditions (insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus with metabolic acidosis, alcoholism, cirrhosis, and corticosteroid treatment), and one had short gut syndrome with multiple surgical interventions. Two of the patients had no recognizable underlying condition. Our patient was a 40-year-old man who apparently had no underlying disease except non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, which is a frequently associated condition among patients developing zygomycosis, particularly the rhinocerebral form of the disease. However, diabetes mellitus in our patient was well controlled by oral anti-diabetics, and the patient was apparently healthy and occupationally functional."

Gastrointestinal involvement with mucormycosis may occur rarely, generally in the same type of patient as shown in the following citations:

Clearly, the risk of ingestion of this organism is not zero. - Mod.LL
