[1] Sierra Leone: dangerous misinformation
Date: 28 May 2014
Source: Cocorioko Newspaper [edited]


Dr. Gbakima says Abdul Fonti's report is very misleading and unfortunate. As the Government fights to stop the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone, Editor-In-Chief of the opposition SLPP online newspaper, The New People, wrote on Facebook and in his newspaper that the Minister of Health, Hon. Miatta Kargbo, had ordered all patients who have tested positive for the Ebola virus to be kidnapped, killed and buried.

In an exclusive interview with Cocorioko last night [27 May 2014], the minister condemned the story without naming the editor. She said that certain journalists wanted to incite the people of Sierra Leone by spreading dangerous and misleading reports in the social media to create chaos that has the potential to engulf the whole country. The minister doubted the sanity of any journalist who would sit down and fabricate such a wicked story.

"This sort of message does not help," remarked Dr Aiah A. Gbakima, a biologist and country director at Global Viral Testing. ... He called the editor's story "misleading" [a huge understatement. - Mod.JW]. There has been vigorous preparation to stop this virus from entering Sierra Leone by the Ministry of Health and Sanitation, development partners, non-governmental organizations, and many others, Gbakima asserted. On learning about the crisis Monday [26 May 2014] night from the team in Kenema, Gbakima said the health minister was kept informed as were a group of people from the Ministry of Health who stayed up in meetings until 2:00 am.

"Bear in mind, Gbakima explained, Kenema is the only hospital in the country with a special isolation unit to handle all viral hemorrhagic fevers. The ambulance was to bring the confirmed case for hospitalization. Meanwhile, the contacts of this patient (7-8 people) were identified and were also put in health centers pending their samples being tested. When the ambulance and the health surveillance team got to Kissi Teng, the chief apparently refused to cooperate with the team and refused to allow the ambulance to take the patient to Kenema for admission and to be given supportive treatment and possibly save her life. They [the chief and associates] did not stop at this but forcibly removed all the contacts who were beginning to show signs of Ebola (vomiting, diarrhea, high fever, and body pains) and took them away and hid them."

"Before this confirmed case, a lot of training had been done for most health workers, and they were all given personal protective equipment, gloves, masks, etc. The border post health workers were trained and these "Train the Trainers" were also supported to train others in their areas. There was a lot of sensitization about Ebola. These programs were all presented and discussed at the National Task Force meetings every week that was chaired by the Minister of Health and Sanitation herself. I am a member of this Task Force. I do not see any reason for the writer to say that there was lack of preparedness."

"On Mon 26 May 2014, there was an emergency Task Force meeting to announce that we have a confirmed case and that there were patients admitted with diarrhea and vomiting; 4 others were admitted later on. There were 4 deaths. The minister did not hide anything from the Task Force, and we all discussed the approach to this outbreak."

"The index case was a lady, and all those who attended the funeral and the 40th day ceremony were requested to be seen by trained surveillance officers and to possibly take a blood sample from each if there was a need to do so. The idea was to eliminate those who were positive from those who were not at that point in time."

"When the Minister was told of the removal of the patients from the Hospital/clinic in Kissi Teng chiefdom, she alerted the stakeholders and summoned another Task Force meeting today, Tue 27 May 2014. Before that meeting, she met with all Members of Parliament from Kailahun District and other stakeholders from that district to solicit their assistance in identifying these patients and to stop the spread of this deadly virus. The teams from Kailahun, Kenema and Kono depart on Wed 28 May 2014 to have meetings with their chiefs and people in these border districts."

"As far as I know, and I was at both Task Force meetings on Monday and Tuesday [26-27 May 2014], at no time did the Minister of Health say or even suggest that these patients should be kidnapped and brought to Kenema to die. In fact, it was decided by the Task Force that we should set up an isolation unit in Koindu to stop people from being transported to Kenema for the distance."

"In addition, all samples will be sent to the mobile lab in Gbakedu on the [Guinea] border to be tested instead of Kenema due to distance. Tents have been donated by MSF (Medecins Sans Frontieres, or Doctors without Borders) to set up the isolation unit in Koindu and to expand the ward in Kenema in case we are overwhelmed. The health workers in all the border districts were trained on how to set up an isolation unit during the 3 weeks of training preparedness response."

"Let me tell you why these patients were taken away by their relatives. They live very close to Guinea, and most use the Guinean currency; they buy from and sell in Guinea and have relatives in Guinea. During the outbreak in Guinea, the news going around was that when they take one's relatives to take blood, they never come back. This created fear that if they take their relatives to either take samples or take them to Kenema for treatment, they will not come back. But 3 of those who disappeared from Kissi Teng came by themselves to the Kenema Government Hospital for treatment for diarrhea and vomiting. Because of the alertness of staff there, they were immediately referred to the isolation ward, and we now have 3 patients confirmed for Ebola admitted, and they are all alive. The World Health Organization is sending expert physicians and anthropologists to help educate these people on Ebola virus disease (EVD). The posting by the editor is really false and very unfortunate. The minister and her team have been working very hard to contain this outbreak. I am sure you will hear from them," Gbakima said.

[2] Sierra Leone: 2nd death confirmed
Date: 28 May 2014
Source: ReliefWeb [edited]
http://reliefweb.int/report/sierra-leone/second-person-dies-ebola-virus-sierra-leone


Sierra Leone Wednesday [28 May 2014] confirmed a 2nd death from the ebolavirus, as the WHO warned of possible further contagion as others sick with the haemorrhagic fever had been moved out of isolation and back to their village.

"One of the 7 ebolavirus disease (EVD) patients, a woman admitted at the Isolation Centre in the Government Hospital in Kenema, died on Tuesday [27 May 2014]," Dr Brima Kargbo, the chief medical officer, told AFP in a telephone interview. The 6 other patients affected were "undergoing treatment," added Dr Kargbo. The announcement of the death comes 2 days after Sierra Leone confirmed its 1st fatality from Ebola.

The WHO meanwhile warned of likely further contagion as 4 of the sick patients had been taken back to their home village. They were removed from an isolation facility in the east of the country by family members who were unwilling to see them remain in a hospital far from home, WHO scientist Pierre Formenty told reporters in Geneva. "Of course by doing that, they exposed themselves, and they exposed the villages," he said, adding that the EVD patients were still in Kuindu village, near the border with Guinea, the epicentre of the West African outbreak.

In response to the epidemic, Sierra Leone has restricted travel in some areas and reaffirmed an earlier ban on trips to attend funerals in Guinea.

Lack of cooperation allows epidemic to spread
-------------------------------
Authorities have designated the eastern regions of Kailahun, where the 1st case was confirmed, and Kenema as "high risk." Officials are trying to encourage residents to cooperate with health workers, but Formenty said getting populations in both Sierra Leone and Guinea on board with efforts to rein in the epidemic remained a major challenge. "The lack of collaboration with some affected families has allowed this epidemic to continue to spread invisibly between family members," he said, insisting on the need to work harder to explain the benefit of isolating the sick. West African authorities have also been scrambling to stop mourners from touching bodies during traditional funeral rituals.

However, Formenty pointed to the fluid borders between Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone and said: "We're on high alert in Liberia."

[4] Nigeria, call for action
Date: 28 May 23014
From: Shamsudeen Fagbo (Cross-posted from Nigerian Biomedical and Life Scientists, a Yahoo group) <oloungbo@yahoo.com> [edited]


ProMED post "Ebola virus disease - West Africa (48): Sierra Leone, more cases, preparedness 20140527.2501116" reminds us that the threat of Ebola to other parts of West Africa, including the Giant of Africa [Nigeria], is far from being over.

We ask again: What levels of preparedness do we have in place at the federal and state levels? Will the symptoms mentioned below -- diarrhoea and vomiting -- lead our clinicians to suspect ebolavirus disease (EVD) or even any other hemorrhagic fever?

Though Nigeria should be donating to Sierra Leone (surely we should able to afford the concentrated bleach given to them by the Americans) as a form of health diplomacy, we can benefit in several ways from the events being led by the Americans as described in the post. We can make hay while the sun shines.

[There is active social and commercial cross-border traffic in the region where Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia meet, with people moving in all directions. Allegations such as those reported above just help to keep the outbreak going by frightening people into not cooperating with prevention and control measures.

ProMED is happy to have been quoted by ECDC News. Shamsudeen's comment on Nigeria is well timed. - Mod.JW
