The Texas Department of State Health Services offers precautionary information after a Texas Panhandle resident recently developed hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, or HPS.

The person is a resident of Swisher County and has recovered from the infection. Exposure most likely occurred in a rodent-infested barn when dust was stirred up. This is the 1st confirmed case of HPS in Texas this year [2014]. One case was reported in the state last year.

Hantavirus is carried by certain species of rats and mice. The illness is rare. Infected rodents shed the virus in their urine, droppings, and saliva. The virus can be transmitted to people when infected rat or mouse urine, saliva, droppings, or nesting materials are stirred up, temporarily aerosolizing the virus, which can be breathed in by humans. HPS cases are frequently associated with spring cleaning.

DSHS recommends the following precautions:
- seal openings that may allow rats and mice to enter homes and workplaces;
- remove brush, woodpiles, trash, and other items that may attract rats and mice;
- tightly close garbage cans, pet food containers, and other food sources;
- wear protective gloves to handle dead mice and rats or to clean up nesting areas, urine, or droppings;
- before cleaning up nests or droppings found inside, open windows and doors to ventilate the area for at least 30 minutes;
- do not stir up nests by sweeping or vacuuming. Dampen areas before clean-up;
- use a disinfectant or 1-to-10 bleach-water mixture to clean up dead rodents, nests, urine, and droppings.

Early symptoms of hantavirus infection include fatigue, fever, and muscle aches. These symptoms may be accompanied by headaches, dizziness, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Later symptoms include coughing and shortness of breath. If hantavirus is suspected, people should contact their health care provider immediately.

A total of 39 HPS cases have been confirmed in Texas since 1993, the 1st year it was reported, and 14 of those cases resulted in death.

[This report does not indicate the sex or age of the patient, or the specific location in Swisher County where the infection occurred. Although not stated in the above report, the virus involved in this HPS case probably is Sin Nombre virus (SNV), which is endemic in deer mice (_Peromyscus maniculatus_) including in Texas. This is the season for spring cleaning in North America, and closed buildings that have been unused overwinter often provide habitats for deer mice and become sites for human exposure to Sin Nombre virus. Although Sin Nombre virus infections with HPS are relatively rare, the risk of death is significant. Individuals cleaning areas where the mice may be present are well advised to heed the above recommendations in order to avoid exposure.
