Fungal disease threatens grape crops
------------------------------------
Table and wine grape growers fear a fungal disease outbreak will slash yields and taint grapes. Scientists have detected high levels of powdery mildew throughout the Victorian and South Australian Mallee.

Professor Eileen Scott, University of Adelaide, says cool weather has contributed to the spread of the disease. "When it's a bit mild and overcast the fungus can really get going," Dr Scott said. "I'm certainly aware that there's a big problem this year (2014) because I've been contacted by a number of people from the Riverland and other areas who say they're having a really bad powdery mildew year."

[A number of] wineries have warned their growers about the high levels of powdery mildew.

[Powdery mildew (PM) of grapevine is caused by the fungus _Erysiphe necator_ (previously _Uncinula necator_). Leaves heavily infected by powdery mildew have reduced photosynthetic ability resulting in decreased plant vigour and increased chance of winter injury to the vines. Spores are spread to the leaves and berries mainly by splashing rain, wind, or mechanical means. The fungus overwinters in infected leaves on the ground. The disease can be extremely serious and will cause severe crop losses. It is usually controlled with fungicides.

Powdery mildews are a group of fungi causing similar symptoms on a range of host plants. The group includes many species in a number of genera. Generally, each fungal species is confined to a number of host species it affects. The pathogens cause serious losses in many important crops including cereals, hops, canola, sugar beet, and a number of vegetable crops.
