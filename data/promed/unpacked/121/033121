Chicken meat injected with water and animal proteins from the Netherlands
--------------------------------------------------
Sometime ago you ran a short thread on the injection of chicken meat
or tumbling of chicken meat with water and other animal proteins to
enhance the weight to increase profit margins, from Dutch producers
of chicken meat. There was the risk that these other proteins were
not necessarily chicken protein, but could also have included pork
and beef proteins, which was alarming if true, as this meant that
chicken could also be a source of BSE.
In the UK we have a program called "Panorama" which is an
investigative journalism magazine program. Last night (22 May 2003),
their investigations revealed that some of these companies did use
water with dissolved non-chicken hydrolysed animal proteins to
enhance the weight of these products (thus enhancing their profits).
These investigations were probably been carried out sometime last
year (perhaps around the time of your previous thread on this) and
only broadcast this week.
When they traced these protein additives back to a company in
Germany, secret filming during interviews with the director of this
company revealed that some of these animal protein additives had been
specially "treated". This special process had enabled the DNA in
these animal proteins to be reduced to a "single base-pair", so as to
make the protein animal source unidentifiable by PCR testing
techniques that are used to detect other animal contaminating
proteins in foods. This special process was obviously a company
secret, and Panorama went on to show that such proteins had been used
by some major chicken producers in The Netherlands (and elsewhere
they hinted, in foods other than chicken, e.g. ham enhanced with beef
protein).
My question is: Would such extreme procedures applied to these other
animal proteins actually be sufficiently extreme to destroy prion
proteins? Without the details, perhaps we will never know.
Perhaps we should alert our Food Standards Agencies or similar
watchdogs to be on renewed lookout for such "hydrolysed
protein-enhanced meat products" entering our countries. I can supply
more details if readers are interested, though these details are
freely available on the website for this "Panorama" program, which
has further results from their investigation.
