[Details of the specific type of test or tests upon which a diagnosis
of disease is based are usually provided in typical OIE reports. They
were not included in this official report, although results were
noted to be positive. With an important zoonotic disease such as
this, citation of tests carried out would be informative and enhance
transparency. - Mod.PC]
