Bangladesh: Outbreak of Nipah Virus Infection Now Over
------------------------------------------------------
The outbreak of Nipah virus encephalitis that began in mid-March 2004 has
ended. The outbreak, which occurred in the Faridpur District of Bangladesh,
was responsible for 34 cases, including 26 deaths. No new cases have been
reported since mid-April 2004. The Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) confirmed Nipah virus infection in 16 of the cases. Health
authorities in Bangladesh, the International Center for Diarrheal Disease
Research in Bangladesh, CDC, and other international partners worked
together to assess and control this outbreak. Outbreaks of Nipah virus
encephalitis have previously occurred in Bangladesh in May
2001, January/February 2003, and January/February 2004.
Nipah virus, which was discovered in 1999, is a zoonotic virus (infectious
disease that can be transmitted from certain animals to humans). Fruit bats
of the genus _Pteropus_ are thought to be the reservoir for this virus. The
initial outbreak in Malaysia and Singapore affected humans and commercial
swine herds, although other species, including cats, dogs, and horses, were
also infected. The virus mainly caused respiratory illness among the pigs
and an encephalitis syndrome among humans. Nipah virus infection can cause
fever, muscle pains (myalgia), drowsiness, and encephalitis characterized
by serious central nervous system illness, coma, seizures, and inability to
maintain breathing.
As a general precaution, CDC advises travelers to avoid contact with wild
or domestic animals in the region. As with other infectious illnesses, one
of the most important and appropriate preventive practices is careful
and frequent hand washing, which helps remove potentially infectious
materials from the skin and prevents disease transmission. For more
