[During 2017, the Palestinian Authority reported 2 FMD events to the OIE -- one located in Gaza Strip and the other in the West Bank. Both were caused by FMDV serotype O. The situation for each of these events is as follows:

1. FMD-O Gaza Strip: event started 2 Feb 2017; 2 outbreaks reported, and the event was resolved on 20 Apr 2017. See event summary and updated map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=22922.
2. FMD-O West Bank: event started 1 May 2017; 4 outbreaks reported, and the event was resolved on 1 Aug 2017. See event summary and updated map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=23797

On the other hand, according to EUFMD's (European Commission for the Control of Foot-and-Mouth Disease) monthly global report for July 2017, FMDV serotype SAT-2 was the responsible of outbreaks reported in Gaza on 12 Jul 2017. An alert was released by the CVO of Israel (see ProMED-mail posting 20170730.5215192) reporting that the results of the samples collected from sick calves of 2 farms situated in Rafah on [13 Jul 2017] and examined by the Kimron Veterinary Institute, Beit-Dagan on [17 Jul 2017] are indicative of FMDV SAT-2. As all the sick calves were slaughtered and no new outbreaks were reported; further sampling from the outbreaks was not possible. FMDV SAT-2 was recorded for the 1st and only time in the Gaza strip in 2012, while in Israel this serotype was never reported. The closest country to the former 2 that detected FMDV SAT-2 is Egypt, with reports of circulation of this virus between May and June of 2016, while genotyping is of an isolate collected in 2015 that was identified as SAT2/VII/Alx-12. See http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/eufmd/docs/FMD_monthly_reports/2017/July2017.pdf

Outbreak no. 3 (2379), in the Hebron district, named in the OIE report as "Al Sheokh, North Hebron" is located about 6.7 km (4.2 mi) north to the outbreak in Bani Na'im. This municipality is spelled in the Google mapping system and in other sources (English), as "alShuyukh" or "ash-Shuyukh".

The locations of the 3 FMD outbreaks in the Hebron district can be summarized as follows:

1. Kharas, 10 km (6.2 mi) north west of Hebron; map at https://tinyurl.com/yaqo6ld3;
2. Bani Na'im, 6 km (3.7 mi) south east of Hebron; map at https://tinyurl.com/yblday96;
