Our staff on site in Aceh have confirmed that there are at least 5 patients
with tetanus admitted in the public hospital. At this stage we have no
clearer idea of case numbers, nor of deaths from this disease. There is
also a shortage of tetanus immune globulin in the area.

I would like to make a correction to the typo in the editor's note that:
"The disease tetanus is an intoxication due to the elaboration of tetanus
toxoid by _Clostridium tetani_". The culprit is the toxin; the toxoid is
used for the vaccine.

[ProMED thanks Irene Lai for her prompt reply regarding tetanus cases in
Aceh. We also thank Dr. Fleming for her recognition of my typographical
error related to the use of the word toxoid instead of toxin.
For readers' interest, the use of toxoids began in 1923 at the Pasteur
Institute, when Demontre and Ramon found that diphtheria toxin treated with
formalin and heat was transformed into a nontoxic but immunogenic moiety
that could be used to immunize against diphtheria. Initially called
anatoxines by Ramon, these compounds are now known as toxoids. - Mod.LL]
