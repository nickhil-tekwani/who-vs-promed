Japan: Human Cases of Avian Influenza - Laboratory Findings
--------------------------------------------------
In response to the posting "Avian influenza, humans - Japan (Kyoto)(03):
conf" (archive number: 20041222.3372), I would like to forward some
information from the website of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare
of Japan. Please note that this is merely a digest of the information, and
may contain translation errors.
Subjects of the survey:
----------------------
"exposed groups"
[A] (farm workers): 16 workers at the chicken farm where the outbreak occurred
[B] (local government employees): 42 local government employees who were
involved in controlling the outbreak (investigating the farm and/or culling
the chickens during the event)
"control group"
[C]: 33 local government employees who did NOT participate in the control
operation
Blood samples:
-------------
Blood samples were drawn 19-28 Apr 2004, about one month after the end of
the outbreak control operation. In addition, 4 people among the 58
"exposed" had their blood taken on 11 Mar 2004, and those samples were also
tested in this survey.
Antibody assay:
---------------
Neutralizing antibody titers against the influenza A(H5N1) Kyoto strain
(A/Chicken/Kyoto/3/2004) were measured using a "micro-neutralizing assay"
at the Department of Virology III of the National Institute of Infectious
Diseases.
Results of the assay:
Neutralizing antibody titer
Group / Number / <1:10 / 1:10 or higher /
[A] / 16 / 12 / 4* /
[B] / 42 / 41 / 1 /
[C] / 33 / 33 / 0 /
*note: serum pair showed "seroconversion" in one of the 4; "seropositive"
farm workers; no serum pairs were available for the other 4 "seropositive"
people in groups [A] and [B].
(1:10, which is the lower detection limit of this micro-neutralizing assay,
was chosen as the cut-off value, because all 33 of the members of the
control group showed titers of less than 1:10.)
Symptoms of the 5 people who showed "positive" antibody titers:
--------------------------------------------------
One farm worker, who exhibited seroconversion, had a sore throat for
several days just after participating in the operation. However, this
person did not develop fever or other systemic symptoms. 4 other people
also failed to show systemic flu-like symptoms such as fever.

Japan: Virus Isolated in Kyoto Resembles South Korean Isolates
--------------------------------------------------
Japan confirmed its 1st human case of avian influenza flu and said 4 other
people were suspected of catching the disease which has gripped Southeast
Asia, but none of them have developed symptoms. Japan also banned imports
of poultry from South Korea in response to a new outbreak this month at a
farm in the neighbouring country where thousands of ducks were culled.
The health ministry ruled out any danger to public health, although bird
flu has already taken a human toll -- after a poultry farmer and his wife
killed themselves in a cover-up scandal.
4 of the 5 people suspected of catching the disease were employees at a
poultry farm near the western city of Kyoto which took few precautions
dealing with an outbreak in February, the health ministry said in a
statement. The other person was a city official who helped disinfect the
farm. All 5 had tested positive for avian influenza through blood tests
since April, and one of them showed an increase in antibodies confirming an
infection, the Ministry said.
The infected male employee, who had taken 2 tests, suffered from a sore
throat for a few days after taking anti-virus medication. The 4 other
people have not been confirmed with bird flu because they took only one
test each, but "it is highly possible that they have been infected", the
statement said. None of the 5 developed symptoms peculiar to influenza, and
they "are not expected to pose public health problems, as there is no
possibility that they will develop such symptoms or infect other people",
the statement added.
Following the outbreak at the poultry farm owned by Asada Nosan Co., some
240 000 chickens and 20 million eggs were destroyed to contain the disease.
In August 2004 Asada Nosan's president Hideaki Asada received a one-year
jail term, suspended for 3 years, for failing to report the outbreak, which
was only uncovered after suspicious neighbours informed authorities. His
father -- the chairman of Asada Nosan -- and mother were found hanging in
an apparent double suicide in early March after coming under intense media
scrutiny for continuing to ship produce. The attempt to cover up the
outbreak was seen as having led the farm employees to work without wearing
sufficient protective clothing or gear.
Experts say avian influenza has entrenched itself in much of Asia and is
unlikely to disappear anytime soon. In the past year, 12 people in
Thailand and 20 in Viet Nam have died of the virus. The agriculture
ministry said in June that wild migratory birds from the Korean peninsula
might have brought bird flu into Japan. In its final report on the
outbreak, a ministry research team said [RNA] samples [of the virus
isolated] in Japan were virtually identical to those from the virus from
South Korea. The agriculture ministry announced Wednesday that poultry
imports from South Korea would be stopped until further notice. The imports
"would be suspended temporarily to take the surest measure" against the
latest suspected outbreak of bird flu in South Korea, an agriculture
ministry spokesman said.
The Japanese government has confirmed 4 outbreaks of avian influenza,
including the Kyoto case, domestically since January -- the 1st in the
country since 1925. The health ministry said it had taken several months to
determine the human infection because it was being careful due to the lack
of established methods to test for the deadly H5N1 bird flu strain.

[It is clear that the delay in reporting these human cases of avian
influenza virus infection in Japan was a consequence of the initial attempt
to cover up the outbreak and its origin. The suicide of the parents of the
president of the company concerned is a distressing by-product of the incident.
The data demonstrate that exposure to avian influenza virus-infected
poultry does not pose a serious risk to human health. It re-emphasizes the
need to undertake seroprevalence studies in Thailand and Viet Nam in order
to understand the reason for the apparent high fatality rates in these
countries compared with elsewhere in East Asia. - Mod.CP]
