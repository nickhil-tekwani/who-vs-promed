14 people in Kabwe, mostly children were bitten by a rabid dog
which went on the rampage in townships, leaving the victims in a
quandary as most of them cannot afford the expensive rabies
treatment course.
The dog first attacked 12 people in Chowa and Railway townships
on Sunday and on Monday two more people fell victim of the fierce
pet.
Central Province principal livestock officer Mukumba Malumo
confirmed the attack. Mr Malumo said he received a report from
residents on Sunday, and on Monday police reported to him that
the number had swelled to 14 people bitten by the dog.
Police who launched a hunt for the dog could not shoot it down as
it was lurking in residential areas where they feared they could
accidentally kill innocent people.
But the residents on Monday stoned it to death.
Mr Malumo said his officers obtained brain and other samples from
the dog and sent them to Lusaka for tests. Results are expected in
today.
Mr Malumo said the 14 victims needed to be assisted as the treatment
course was expensive. He said the treatment of the 14 victims was now
in the hands of Kabwe general hospital and other medical institutions.
UNIP district chairman Wilfred Wonani who was one of the first to
report about the ravaging dog, said the victims were told that the cost
of the rabies treatment per course was K250,000, a situation which
had thrown many of them into a quandary.
Mr Wonani appealed to Government to consider treating the victims
free of charge as most of them were dependants of Zambia Railways
retrenchees. He said the dog was owned by a widow.
The Veterinary department has appealed to people who own pets to
ensure they are vaccinated. Mr Malumo said in view of the
development, his men had been dispatched to various townships to
vaccinate the pets. He appealed to residents to cooperate with the
officers.
