A total of 39 people have been found infected with anthrax in Gangni
upazila [sub district] of Meherpur district [Khulna division]. Of the
infected, 17 are undergoing treatment at the Gangni Upazila Health
Complex while the remaining have already received treatment.

Resident physician of the health complex Dr Anwarul Islam told
bdnews24.com on Saturday [16 Jul 2011] that an ailing cow was
slaughtered at Kallyanpur village of the upazila on 5 Jul 2011 and
those who processed the meat and consumed it contracted the
infection.

Meherpur district civil surgeon Abdus Shahid told bdnews24.com that
there is nothing to panic and that they have sufficient medicine in
stock for treatment of the disease.

The government officially started reporting human infection of
anthrax in August 2009.

The bacterium can survive in harsh conditions for even centuries in
the soil. Cattle get infected while grazing during the rainy season
when water brings the bacterium to the surface, experts say.

[The problem in Bangladesh is that they have clay soils not black
steppe soils and that during the monsoon all the usual cattle grazing
areas, such as in the post-harvest rice paddy fields, are flooded
thanks to the monsoon. So there is essentially no grazing and any
anthrax spores from abandoned carcasses are being flushed away by the
flood waters. This leaves the most probable risk to be the commercial
feeds given to the housed cattle at this time.

Genomic analyses to date indicate strains common with those in China
but on the other hand if the outbreaks are due to imported
contaminated bone meals they might be originating in Indian Bengal --
the problem is that the genomic characteristics of the latter are
unknown.

Meherpur is in the Khulna division on the western border with India.
A simple explanation is that the contaminated bone meals come from
recycled domestic bones from Bangladeshi cattle. Customarily dead cows
are just tossed and after the village dogs and wild scavengers have
reduced it to bones, the latter are collected up, sold, and processed.
Studies are in hand by the Bangladeshi public health and livestock
authorities in Dhaka to clarify the anthrax epidemiology specific to
this country.
