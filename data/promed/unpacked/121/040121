At a press conference, minister [of agriculture] Gerasim Alaverdyan
said there is no sharp hike in vegetable prices, nor is one expected.

The minister also stated that fungus disease recently spread among
plants, as well as rodents, may affect the crop yield. The Ministry of
Agriculture had allotted 300 million drams (USD 800 000) to combat them.
