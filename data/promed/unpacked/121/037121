South Africa says it has finally traced the source of an outbreak [of listeriosis] that has killed 180 people in the past year -- said to make it the worst in history.

The source is a factory operated by Enterprise Foods in Polokwane in Limpopo. More facilities are being tested to see if they contributed to the outbreak, which infected almost 1000 people.

The health minister warned cross-contamination of other processed meats could have occurred in shops. "Avoid all processed meat products that are sold as ready-to-eat‚" Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi told journalists at the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) on Sunday afternoon [4 Mar 2018]. He told pregnant women to avoid any processed meat "like the plague", reported Times Live.

More than 16 environmental samples from the Enterprise Polokwane factory tested positive for the _Listeria monocytogenes_ strain ST 6 -- a particularly virulent strain. Mr Motsoaledi said a ready-to-eat sausage known as polony, made by Enterprise Food and RCL Foods, would be recalled from stores.

A shortage of the solution used for testing for the _Listeria_ bacteria meant the results of the tests at the Polokwane factory were delayed by 2 weeks, NICD's Dr Juno Thomas told Times Live.

It is believed that the factory will be closed down.

The _Listeria_ bacterium is hard to test for, as it is not homogenously distributed in food. It can also "hide away" in cracks or niches in factories. Consumers who stored recalled products in their fridges should disinfect them with diluted bleach.

The outbreak of listeriosis has been traced to an Enterprise Foods facility in Polokwane, Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi announced on [Sun 4 Mar 2018]. "We can now conclude scientifically that the source of the present outbreak is the Enterprise Food production facility located in Polokwane," he said at the offices of the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) in Johannesburg.

_Listeria_ has [also] been traced to another Enterprise facility in Germiston on the East Rand, and a Rainbow chicken facility in the Free State, but further tests were needed as the sequence type was not yet known.

The National Consumer Commission has issued safety recall notices to those manufacturers and facilities, and the companies are now responsible for coming up with the recall plan. The plan must be sufficient to cover their entire distribution chain, and the facilities will also have to resource and pay for the implementation.

Motsoaledi said several children presented with gastroenteritis in Soweto [Johannesburg metropolitan municipality, Gauteng] earlier in the week. Tests were done, and it was found that they had listeriosis. The strain they were affected with, which was the same for the larger outbreak, was traced to Enterprise's Polokwane facility.

Motsoaledi said statistics on [2 Mar 2018] show that the outbreak has claimed about 180 lives and 948 laboratory-confirmed cases had been reported to the NICD.

He said while polony was a definite source, other products such as Viennas, Russians, Frankfurters, other sausages and cold meats not typically cooked could also be affected due to the risk of cross-contamination.

Pregnant women, neonates, elderly people and anyone with weakened systems should "not go near" these products.

Motsoaledi said retailers must clean their fridges, meat slicers, and either remove the ready-to-eat meat products or place them in plastic bags in separate fridges -- ahead of the recall. "I've already emptied [out] my fridge this morning... I woke up my wife -- [and told let's] just take these things out," he said. "Any human being in the country who has these products in their fridge must take them out immediately."

_Listeria_ is a bacterium that is naturally found in the environment -- it commonly occurs in soil, water, vegetation, and in the faeces of some animals. It can contaminate a wide variety of food types, including meat and meat products, dairy products (unpasteurised and pasteurised), fresh and frozen produce (fruits, vegetables, and sprouts) and ready-to-eat products.

South Africans were told on [Sun 4 Mar 2018] not to consume ready-to-eat processed meat as the government identified the source of a [listeriosis] outbreak that has killed 180 people as a cold meat product made by the country's biggest consumer foods group.

The meat, known as "polony", made by Tiger Brands unit Enterprise Food and by RCL Foods, would be recalled from stores, Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi said.

"We advise members of the public to avoid all processed meat products that are sold as ready-to-eat," Motsoaledi said, adding that, due to the risk of cross-contamination, all such foods were a potential health hazard.

"We can now conclude scientifically that the source of the present outbreak is the Enterprise Food production facility located in Polokwane," Motsoaledi told a briefing at the offices of the National Institute of Communicable Diseases.

Tiger Brands said it was cooperating with authorities and RCL Foods said it would suspend all production of its Rainbow Polony brand.

Motsoaledi said although RCL Foods had not been identified as a source of the outbreak, a facility owned by the firm was under investigation. Inquiries were ongoing at a second facility run by Enterprise Foods to establish if it too had contributed.

The outbreak has caused 180 fatalities and 948 reported cases since January 2017.

Tiger Brands spokeswoman Nevashnee Naicker said: "We are all extremely concerned by listeriosis -- we all want to find the source or sources of listeriosis, together with the government."

RCL Foods chief legal officer Stephen Heath said the company was recalling its polony products even though test results were still pending. "RCL Foods is sharing all results from its testing, both internally and externally, with the relevant authorities," Heath said. "We will continue to take every precaution to safeguard our products as well as our consumers.

South African supermarket operator Pick n Pay said it had withdrawn the products from its shelves. "All fridges and food preparation areas in our stores will now be re-cleaned to prevent any cross-contamination. Recalled meat is being isolated and will be safely destroyed," spokeswoman Tamra Capstick-Dale said in a statement.

[When last reported by ProMED-mail (Listeriosis - South Africa (07): fatal, more cases 20180224.5648305), there were 915 confirmed cases nationally, including 172 deaths, with a case fatality rate of 18.8 percent. Now the outbreak involves 948 laboratory-confirmed cases, including 180 deaths, which is said to be the world's biggest documented listeriosis outbreak.

The news reports above say that the outbreak strain, _Listeria monocytogenes_ strain ST 6, has been recovered from the Enterprise factory in Polokwane (Tiger Brands unit), definitely involving a ready-to-eat sausage known as polony, but possibly could also involve other ready-to-eat meat products such as Viennas, Russians, Frankfurters, other sausages and cold meats due to cross-contamination. According to another news report, preliminary, results show that other ready-to-eat products at Enterprise's Germiston plant‚ as well as Rainbow Chickens' (RCL) Wolwehoek plant, also contain _Listeria_‚ but the sequence type has yet to be confirmed (https://www.timeslive.co.za/news/consumer-live/2018-03-04-listeriosis-what-to-do-with-your-enterprise-or-rainbow-polony/).

We are told that polony, made by Enterprise Food, would be recalled from stores, but are not given identification markings. Another news report says that Enterprise is also being urged to recall smoked Russians and frankfurters and Rainbow (RCL) is being instructed to do the same with its chicken Viennas, although RCL Foods has not been identified as a source of the outbreak (https://www.timeslive.co.za/news/consumer-live/2018-03-04-listeriosis-what-to-do-with-your-enterprise-or-rainbow-polony/).

Bologna sausage, known in South Africa as polony, is a finely ground pork sausage, originally from the Italian city of Bologna; bologna can alternatively be made out of chicken (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna_sausage).

Polokwane is the capital of the Limpopo province and South Africa's largest urban center north of the province of Gauteng; Gauteng is divided into 5 municipalities, 2 of which are Johannesburg and Pretoria (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polokwane).
