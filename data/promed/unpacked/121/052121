A least 131 monkeys died since the beginning of the year [2018] in Rio de Janeiro, the majority (69 percent) because of humans, an official source said this Saturday [27 Jan 2018], who connect the bad luck of these animals with the unfounded fear that they could aggravate the yellow fever outbreak which has been registered in this Brazilian state.

The 69 percent of the animals collected in Rio had signs of human attacks through clubbing or poisoning, said the Subsecretariat of Surveillance, Health Inspection and Zoonoses Control (SUBVISA). SUBVISA stated that of the 131 dead monkeys, 32 were found in the City of Rio, the regional capital.

Environmental organization officials worry about these data and point out that the monkeys are allies for the eradication of yellow fever since they help identify the areas in which the virus is present, but do not transmit it to humans. Yellow fever [virus] can only be acquired by the bite of an infected mosquito, something that is unknown to the population, the specialists said.

Given this situation, the Green Line, a platform for issuing complaints by telephone in the Rio municipality for environmental crimes, initiated a campaign against attacks on monkeys in which those who know of an episode are invited to call or send in photographs and videos, while always guaranteed anonymity. The complaints that are received are sent to the Command of Environmental Police and the Commission for Environmental Protection, according to the municipality.

The states of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo this Thursday [25 Jan 2018] initiated campaigns to intensify vaccination, confronting the increasing number of cases of the disease, which terrify those who live in these regions.

Although the Brazilian health authorities insist on reassuring [everyone] that a yellow fever outbreak does not exist, [human] deaths jumped from 20 to 53 in one week, and the number of cases of the disease increased to 130, according to the latest data from the Ministry of Health.

The most affected states are: Minas Gerais, with 24 [human] deaths, Sao Paulo with 21, and Río de Janeiro with 8, according to official statistics.

The state Secretariat of Health confirmed the 2nd yellow fever death of a monkey in Votorantim (Sao Paulo [state]). In total, 8 dead primates were collected in the Matão Park since the beginning of the year [2018], which motivated the expansion of vaccination [for humans] against the disease.

According to the epidemiological bulletin issued by the Secretariat, updated this Monday (22 [Jan 2018]), 530 infected monkeys died of this yellow fever virus infection in the state since last year [2017], 153 just in the Sorocaba and Jundai regions.

The number of monkeys dead of yellow fever (data from the State Secretariat of Health):

City / Dead monkeys 2017/2018
Campo Limpo Paulista / 13
Itatiba / 17
Jarinu / 20
Jundiaí / 72

[There have been instances in other localities where yellow fever (YF) deaths have occurred in non-human primates (NHP) provoking some local individuals to kill them due to the fear that there would be transmission from monkeys to people. Although there is no indication of the species of dead monkeys in the above reports, there is a serious NHP conservation concern about the deaths of some monkey species, both due to YF infections as well as to people killing them. As indicated in previous comments, this yellow fever (YF) outbreak presents a serious non-human primate conservation problem. The massive deaths of brown howler monkeys that have occurred is bad news. Fortunately, the endangered northern muriqui monkeys do not seem to be affected, and one hopes that this is confirmed in the subsequent studies that are scheduled.

As mentioned in earlier posts, the greatest risk for adverse population effects is the muriqui monkey, Brazil's largest primate and one of the planet's 25 most endangered species of primates. There are 2 species of muriqui monkey in Brazil: the northern muriqui (_Brachyteles hypoxanthus_) that has been on the IUCN's (International Union for Conservation of Nature) critically endangered list for more than 25 years, and the southern muriqui (_Brachyteles arachnoides_), which has been placed on that list more recently. The previous report indicates that brown howler monkeys (_Alouatta guariba_) and masked titis (_Callicebus personatus_) are the non-human primates most affected in this YF outbreak. However, the buffy-headed marmoset (_Callithrix flaviceps_) is also mentioned. It is a rare species of marmoset endemic to the rainforests of southeastern Brazil and occurs in southern Espírito Santo and possibly northern Rio de Janeiro, and its distribution extends into Minas Gerais, the very areas where yellow fever has been occurring. Unfortunately, there is no feasible way to halt YF virus transmission among these non-human primates. Killing them is not a solution. One hopes that enough individuals will survive for the species to recover.
