Background
Sensitive molecular diagnostics and correct test interpretation are crucial for accurate COVID-19 diagnosis and thereby essential for good clinical practice. Furthermore, they are a key factor in outbreak control where active case finding in combination with isolation and contact tracing are crucial.

Aim
With the objective to inform the public health and laboratory responses to the pandemic, we reviewed current published knowledge on the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 infection as assessed by RNA molecular detection in a wide range of clinical samples.

Methods
We performed an extensive search on studies published between 1 Dec 2019 and 15 May 2020, reporting on molecular detection and/or isolation of SARS-CoV-2 in any human laboratory specimen.

Results
We compiled a dataset of 264 studies including 32 515 COVID-19 cases, and additionally aggregated data points (n=2777) from sampling of 217 adults with a known infection timeline. We summarised data on SARS-CoV-2 detection in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract, blood, oral fluid, tears, cerebrospinal fluid, peritoneal fluid, semen, and vaginal fluid; where provided, we also summarised specific observations on SARS-CoV-2 detection in pregnancy, infancy, children, adolescents and immunocompromised individuals.

Conclusion
Optimal SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing relies on choosing the most appropriate sample type, collected with adequate sampling technique and with the infection timeline in mind. We outlined knowledge gaps and directions for future well-documented systematic studies.

[2] Germany: Cross-border contact tracing

Introduction
The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) managed the exchange of cross-border contact tracing data between public health authorities (PHA) in Germany and abroad during the early COVID-19 pandemic.

Aim
We describe the extent of cross-border contact tracing and its challenges.

Methods
We analysed cross-border COVID-19 contact tracing events from 3 Feb to 5 Apr 2020 using information exchanged through the European Early Warning Response System and communication with International Health Regulation national focal points. We described events by PHA, number of contacts, and exposure context.

Results
The RKI processed 467 events, initiating contact to PHA 1099 times (median = 1; interquartile range (IQR): 1 2) and sharing data on 5099 contact persons. Of 327 (70%) events with known exposure context, the most commonly reported exposures were aircraft (n = 64; 20%), cruise ships (n = 24; 7%) and non-transport contexts (n = 210; 64%). Cruise ship and aircraft exposures generated more contacts with authorities (median = 10; IQR: 2 16, median = 4; IQR: 2 11) and more contact persons (median = 60; IQR: 9 269, median = 2; IQR: 1 3) than non-transport exposures (median = 1; IQR: 1 6 and median = 1; IQR: 12). The median time spent on contact tracing was highest for cruise ships: 5 days (IQR: 3 9).

Conclusion
In the COVID-19 pandemic, cross-border contact tracing is considered a critical component of the outbreak response. While only a minority of international contact tracing activities were related to exposure events in transport, they contributed substantially to the workload. The numerous communications highlight the need for fast and efficient global outbreak communication channels between public health authorities.

[Contact tracing is a tried-and-tested public health intervention intended to identify individuals who may have been in contact with an infected person and advise them to take action that will disrupt chains of transmission. Prior to Covid-19, contact tracing was often used to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted infections and has been heralded as vital to the eradication of smallpox in the UK.

According to modelling published by the Lancet Infectious Diseases, a combination of self-isolation, effective contact tracing, and social distancing measures may be the most effective and efficient way to control the spread of Covid-19 (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30457-6/fulltext). However, for contact tracing to be at its most effective, the modelling estimates that for every 1000 new symptomatic cases, 15 000 to 41 000 contacts would have to be asked to self-isolate. Clearly, the logistical burden of operating a manual contract tracing system is high.

In October 2020, The European Commission (EC) activated its interoperability gateway service for national contact tracing apps in Germany, Republic of Ireland, and Italy, allowing the encrypted data of millions of people related to Covid-19 (coronavirus) infections to be transferred across borders. Interoperability through the gateway service will be possible for a total of 20 apps based on decentralised systems.

The interoperability gateway service (gateway) is a digital infrastructure that ensures the secure transmission of generated keys between the backend servers of participating national contact tracing and warning apps. While doing so, the gateway will share the minimum information necessary for a person to be alerted if they have been exposed to an infected person also using one of the participating apps.

The data exchanged will only be stored in the gateway for a maximum period of 14 days. No other information except the keys, generated by the national apps, will be handled by the gateway [https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_1905#gateway].

The cross-border system does not allow "identification of individual persons," and doesn't track user's location "or movement of devices." Information is "only stored as long as necessary" to trace infections [https://www.mobileworldlive.com/apps/news-apps/ec-launches-cross-border-contact-tracing-tech].

Digital contact tracing may prove to be key to the safe re-opening of the tourism sector and enable users to easily and securely be contact traced across borders. This is an important step in ensuring real time data sharing across borders, which will contribute towards better preparedness and response capacity at points of entry (POEs). - Mod.UBA]

[3] Variants

[A] Philippines

<https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/3/13/philippines-reports-first-brazil-covid-variant-as-new-cases


The Philippines, which has the 2nd-highest number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in South East Asia, is battling a renewed surge as it ramps up a vaccination drive that started on 1 Mar 2021. The Philippines has detected its 1st case of the highly contagious coronavirus variant 1st identified in Brazil, the health department said, as the number of infections surges to the highest level in 6 months.

A Filipino returning from Brazil tested positive for the P.1 variant after 752 samples were sequenced at the genome centre, the department said in a statement on Sat 13 Mar 2021.

It reported 59 new infections of the B.1.1.7 variant 1st detected in the United Kingdom, and 32 cases of the B.1.351 variant discovered in South Africa. This brings cases for those variants to 177 and 90, respectively. "Correct and consistent adherence to the minimum public health standards will prevent the transmission of these variants," the department said. The department also reported 13 cases "with mutations of possible clinical significance."

On Fri 12 Mar 2021, the country reported 4578 new coronavirus infections, the biggest daily increase in cases in nearly 6 months. That brings the total number of confirmed cases to 611 618. The number of deaths reached 12 694, with 87 fatalities added. The renewed surge in COVID-19 cases has prompted mayors in the capital, Manila, an urban sprawl of 16 cities, to impose an evening curfew until the end of March 2021 and remind the public to practise physical distancing.

The latest developments also come as Japanese health officials reported on Fri 12 Mar 2021 a new COVID-19 variant in a traveller from the Philippines. Japan's National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) said that the person's coronavirus sample tested positive for E484K and N501Y mutations. "The variant is distinct from those initially discovered in Britain, South Africa, and Brazil, and is thought to pose a similar level of threat," Kyodo news agency was quoted as saying.

Abstract
We show that the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 lineage is highly disseminated in Portugal, with the odds of B.1.1.7 proportion increasing at an estimated 89% (95% confidence interval: 83-95%) per week until week 3 2021. RT-PCR spike gene target late detection (SGTL) can constitute a useful surrogate to track B.1.1.7 spread, besides the spike gene target failure (SGTF) proxy. SGTL/SGTF samples were associated with statistically significant higher viral loads, but not with substantial shift in age distribution compared to non-SGTF/SGTL cases.

Coronavirus cases and outbreaks of new, more transmissible variants are continuing to increase across Canada, raising concerns of a possible 3rd wave of the ongoing pandemic in the country. As of 11 Mar 2021, there were close to 3000 confirmed cases of "variants of concern" (VOC) across all 10 provinces, with the B.1.1.7 variant accounting for more than 90 per cent of these cases. The B.1.1.7 variant was 1st detected in the United Kingdom in mid-December 2020.

All viruses mutate over time, but the pace of the spread and the reproductive rate of the new variants in the country is "very concerning," experts say. "We are starting a variant-driven 3rd wave now," said Colin Furness, an infection control epidemiologist and assistant professor at the University of Toronto.

The province of Ontario has the highest number of variant cases: 956 of the UK variant; 41 of the B.1.351 variant; and 28 of the P.1 variant. Those variants were 1st discovered in South Africa and Brazil, respectively. The Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table estimates that 41 per cent of the total cases are of VOCs.

Projections for Ontario released on Thursday [11 Mar 2021] estimated that in the next 2 to 3 weeks, COVID-19 rates could grow to up to 8000 new cases a day under the worst-case scenario, depending on the spread of variants.

Jean-Paul Soucy, an infectious disease epidemiologist and PhD student at the University of Toronto, noted that cases of the B.1.1.7 variant, which is responsible for an increasing fraction of infections across the country, were able to grow under lockdown conditions even as conventional COVID-19 cases shrank. "We are facing a 'twindemic here,'" he told Global News.

Alberta has the 2nd-highest number of VOC cases (775) but has yet to report the P.1 variant. Alberta is followed by British Columbia and Quebec, where all 3 variants have been found.

Given B.1.1.7's prevalence and competitive advantage in reproduction, Donald Sheppard, an immunologist and microbiologist at McGill University Health Centre, says Canada has passed the "tipping point" where it will replace the original strain of coronavirus. Provincial modelling out of both Quebec and Ontario suggests that the B.1.1.7 variant could dominate in the provinces in a matter of weeks.

"The variants of concern continue to spread across Ontario, and our ability to control the rate of spread will determine whether we return to normal or we face a 3rd wave of infection," Dr Adalsteinn Brown, the co-chair of Ontario's COVID-19 Science Advisory Table, said during a news conference on Thu 11 Mar 2021.

Experts are concerned that the variants could also delay the end of the pandemic, that has now entered its 2nd year. "I fear the spread of more transmissible and potentially more deadly variants will lead to one last, preventable tragedy," said Soucy. Sheppard said had there been no variants of concern, we would be looking at winding down the pandemic over the summer.

On a positive note, however, there is emerging evidence that the current vaccines appear to be effective against the new variants. However, a number of studies have shown decreased protection of the COVID-19 vaccines against the B.1.351 and P.1 variant. Both contain the E484K mutation in the spike protein of the virus, which appears to have an impact on the body's immune response and vaccine efficacy.

Over the next few weeks and months, Canada is set to receive a heavy influx of vaccine supplies. As a larger percentage of the population gets vaccinated, the mass vaccination campaigns will eventually help reduce transmission and suppress the variants, Soucy said. But until then, public health measures and personal vigilance will be key, he said. Furness predicts that schools will likely need to close briefly in April 2021.

Meanwhile, as daily case counts have stabilized, a number of provinces have eased restrictions in recent weeks. "If we take a more gradual approach to reopening and take a proactive approach in regions to halt accelerating growth, I think we will be in great shape for a COVID-safe summer and a vigorous vaccination campaign to lead us out of this mess," Soucy said.

[Based on the above report, at least 3 of the major variants of concern are circulating in all provinces of Canada. Introduction and implementation of the vaccines will definitely have an impact by checking and/or reducing transmission of cases. Nevertheless, the use of public health measures and social distancing will continue to be important. - Mod.UBA]

[4] Immunity

[A] Immunity to SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern
Date: 12 Mar 2021
Source: Science [abridged, edited]
https://science.sciencemag.org/content/371/6534/1103


Vaccine candidates based on spike, the glycoprotein that is essential for host cell entry by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), were being designed within days of its reported sequence in January 2020. All the vaccines aim to prevent disease primarily (but not exclusively) by eliciting neutralizing antibodies that block spike and therefore prevent the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect cells. The 95% efficacy of the BNT162b2 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine (from Pfizer/BioNTech) heralded a series of results showing that eliciting neutralizing antibodies to spike strongly correlated with protection from disease in clinical trials of various vaccines. Currently, there is concern about reduced vaccine-induced immune protection to emerging variants that have mutations in the spike protein.

Coronaviruses are very large and complex compared with other RNA viruses (around 4 times the size of the hepatitis A virus genome), and their replication fidelity must, therefore, be higher. Despite this, once a pathogen has been allowed to infect more than 100 million people, it is not a surprise that sequence variants with a selective advantage emerge. Toward the latter part of 2020, just as regulators were granting approvals to a series of vaccines based largely on the wildtype "Wuhan" sequence spike antigen, several SARS-CoV-2 "variants of concern" were detected. These variants have potentially enhanced transmission, pathogenicity, immune escape, or a combination of all 3.

The 1st sequences of a variant of concern that emerged in the UK, B.1.1.7 (also called 501Y.V1), emerged in September 2020. It includes 8 amino acid changes within spike. One of these, N501Y (Asn501-Tyr), increases the affinity of spike for its cellular target angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and, together with other less well characterized mutations, has resulted in enhanced transmission (recognized since December 2020) and possibly enhanced pathogenicity. Might this variant also escape antibody-mediated immunity?

Muick et al. examined the ability of immune sera from 40 older or younger 2-dose BNT162b2 vaccine recipients for neutralization of a pseudotype virus (a safe, surrogate virus engineered to express spike) carrying wild-type sequence spike or all of the B.1.1.7 spike mutations. The sera had a wide range of neutralizing antibody titers measured against the wild-type spike, from around 1/50 to around 1/1200. Although there was a significant reduction in geometric mean titers for the younger (though not the older) cohort against the B.1.1.7 variant, the authors argue that on the basis of our understanding of other respiratory viruses such as influenza virus, an overall reduced titer of some 20% would not be predicted to meaningfully reduce vaccine efficacy. However, such findings confirm that the B.1.1.7 spike mutations affect not only transmission but also immune recognition.

Another study looked in considerable detail at potential vaccine escape by B.1.1.7. They considered immune sera from 23 vaccinees with a mean age of 82, analyzed 3 weeks after a single dose of BNT162b2. Using a pseudotype virus carrying spike with all 8 mutations led to a 6-fold reduction of neutralization for the majority of sera. In this older cohort, the ablation of functional neutralization was more apparent in those starting with lower antibody titers to the wild-type sequence spike. A parallel dataset for pseudotype neutralization of wild-type sequence or B.1.1.7 spike by mRNA-1273 (Moderna) or NVX-CoV2373 (Novavax) vaccinee sera detects a more marginal reduction in activity against the variant.

When population variation can mean that people develop diverse neutralizing antibody titers after vaccination, the extent to which a small drop in neutralization endangers protection from symptomatic disease depends to some extent on the immunogenicity of the vaccine and how much margin it leaves for protection. This issue is starting to be addressed through analyses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (University of Oxford/AstraZeneca) vaccinees in the UK. Although neutralizing antibody titer against B.1.1.7 was reduced approximately 9-fold (from a mean of about 1/500 neutralizing antibody titer against wild-type virus), this did not affect vaccine efficacy because there was no enhanced susceptibility to infection [as determined with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing] attributable to the variant among the 499 participants who became infected.

Although the B.1.1.7 variant has had massive impact in exacerbating caseload and severity across many countries, there is even greater concern about variants that carry additional immune evasion mutations, notably the E484K (Glu484-Lys) mutation found in the B.1.351 (501Y.V2) variant that emerged in South Africa, the P.1 variant found in Brazil, and sporadic examples from UK sequencing that show E484K on the B.1.1.7 background. That the immune evasion mutations -- K417N (Lys417-Asn), E484K, and N501Y -- can arise in evolution experiments in vitro involving culture of SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of immune sera offers caution against suboptimal vaccination regimens.

Concern about the B.1.351 variant derives from analyses of its effects on neutralization activity. The variant shows substantial ablation of any virus-neutralizing activity of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Preliminary data suggest a reduced neutralizing response in sera from ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccinees and reduced efficacy in preventing mild to moderate COVID-19. This supports the view that neutralizing antibody titer is the key correlate of protection (CoP). Although analysis based on loss of in vitro neutralizing activity by individual mAbs representing the 3 dominant classes of epitopes on spike offers strong evidence for immune evasion by the variants, the effect is less pronounced at the level of polyclonal immune serum after convalescence or vaccination. This suggests that the neutralizing repertoire is broader and more resilient than so far documented.

Findings from studies with mAbs offer caution for using these therapeutically, given their vulnerability to loss of individual epitopes and also their ability to drive selection of variants that can evade immune recognition. Of course, the flip side of this argument is that detailed mapping of the neutralizing antibody epitopes in spike can facilitate the design of broadly neutralizing vaccines and mAbs that can target numerous spike mutants. It has been posited that SARS-CoV-2 may continue to accumulate mutations that evade immune responses. But as previously explored for other viruses, such as HIV, immune evasion often comes at a biological fitness cost to the virus, tending to impose an upper limit to the number of mutations that can be afforded when faced with a broad, neutralizing antibody repertoire.

Additionally, given that similar mutations arise recurrently in spike, presumably through convergent evolution in geographically distinct isolates, it is possible that the spike variants offering a survival advantage to the virus will be constrained and finite. Furthermore, a spike protein that mutates residues A, B, and C to evade antibody recognition runs the structural risk of generating a new neutralizing epitope, D. Therefore, a finite number of iterative vaccines could target key variants, but this would not necessarily have to be reappraised annually as with influenza virus vaccines. Seasonal "common cold" human coronaviruses tend to appear with 2-year cycles, and recent data for one of these suggest that antigenic drift (mutations that undermine immune recognition) may underlie escape from acquired immunity.

T cell immunity is likely to feature as an additional CoP against COVID-19 (13). The CD4+ and CD8+ T cell response encompasses specificity to several hundred epitopes across the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome, the majority of which are unimpaired in the variants. Even those T cell epitopes that are altered in the SARS-CoV-2 variants will in most cases bind to the different human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules that present antigenic peptides to T cells, although binding affinities may be altered. It would be helpful to investigate whether T cell immunity is modified by the SARS-CoV-2 variants.

The assessment of variants on neutralization are complicated by the variability of pseudotype assays used in these studies. It would be helpful to have standardized live-virus in vitro neutralization assays as internationally comparable reference points. As ever, these are discussions that must be tethered to some sense of CoP values. Although much debated, many researchers have the sense that people with a neutralizing antibody IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration) greater than around 1/100 serum dilution would likely be safe from infection, or at least from symptomatic infection. Given that these are highly potent vaccines that often induce neutralizing antibody responses with IC50 of at least 1/1000, there is hopefully a reasonable safety margin before reduced recognition of variants means that effective protection is lost. Ultimately, the best defense against emergence of further variants of concern is a rapid, global, vaccination campaign in concert with other public health measures to block transmission. A virus that cannot transmit and infect others has no chance to mutate.

[Jennifer Dan and colleagues, in Science in Feb 2021, concluded that "Substantial immune memory is generated after COVID-19, involving all 4 major types of immune memory. About 95% of subjects retained immune memory at about 6 months after infection. Circulating antibody titers were not predictive of T cell memory. Thus, simple serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies do not reflect the richness and durability of immune memory to SARS-CoV-2." [https://science.sciencemag.org/content/371/6529/eabf4063.full].

The option of single dose vaccination in previously infected individuals is worth a consideration, as vaccine dose numbers are limited in the foreseeable future. - Mod.UBA]
