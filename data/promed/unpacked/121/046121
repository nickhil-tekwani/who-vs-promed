The province of El Bayadh has issued a decision to close livestock markets until further notice as a precautionary measure to curb the spread of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD], according to the Veterinary Inspectorate of the province.

The decision came after Veterinary Services detected 34 FMD foci across 13 out of the 22 province municipalities, as confirmed by the state Veterinary Inspectorate official Mr. Houari Saad. The Veterinary Inspectorate thus resorted to livestock market closure given that field investigations proved that the majority of cases recorded recently were acquired from markets such as those discovered during the past few days in the municipalities of El Ghassoul and Astiten.

In addition, the Governor's decision has banned displacement of animals without a license issued by the veterinary services of the public sector as part of the control action to respond to this epidemic situation across the region. Mr. Houari Saad stressed that no cattle death cases were registered so far in the province and, therefore, the situation does not call for concern. He added that vaccination campaign against FMD was intensified and is targeting about 100 000 sheep, 9000 goats and 4000 cattle during the emergency vaccination campaign launched on 1 Apr 2015 to which 13 veterinary teams were enrolled to cover the entire territory of the province.

[With 34 new foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) foci scattered over 13 municipalities and supposedly due to FMD serotype O virus, it appears that the outbreak is rapidly spreading in the province of El Bayadh.

The adopted prevention and control measures seem reactive rather than proactive: closure of livestock markets once their role in the dissemination of the virus became obvious, and vaccination in response to outbreaks instead of preventive vaccination following a national scheme designed at the peak of the epizootic last summer (2014).

It would be useful to identify the serotype/topotype/genotype of the circulating FMD virus to re-confirm its identity (serotype O/SA-ME/india 2001d) and ensure the use of an adequate vaccine, matching the field virus strain, to further combat the present Algerian FMD epizootic in Algeria. - Mod.AB]

[For the location of the large (about 80 000 sq km), semi-arid wilaya (province) El Bayadh, in northwestern Algeria, see map at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Bayadh_Province#/media/File:Algeria_32_Wilaya_locator_map-2009.svg.

This wilaya forms part of Algeria's West Highlands area. In the north, agricultural activity is limited to the oases, especially in the Brezina area. This area is characterised by rugged, hilly terrain and a dry, sub-Saharan climate. This wilaya was not affected by the 2014 FMD epizootic, and probably remained unvaccinated last year.

As also apparent from the vaccination figures, nomadic sheep flocks are the main livestock kept in this area and they may become a likely source of further spread of FMD virus. El Bayadh's relative close proximity to Algeria's western border may mean a hazard to neighbouring Morocco by the movements of grazing sheep, even if economic factors (mutton prices) do not currently support movements of animals for slaughter.

Mod.AB's request for information on the results of the serotyping and genotyping of the currently circulating virus, as well as on the identity of the vaccine strains applied, are underlined. - Mod.AS
