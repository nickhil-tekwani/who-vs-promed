[ProMED-mail has received a number of reports & communications
recently expressing increased concern about whether CWD in North
American native deer & elk may be transmissible to humans. Among
our correspondents were Colin Mackintosh of New Zealand, Michael
Koch of Sweden, & Stephanie Ostrowski of CDC. A new report on
the subject has been released by the US FDA. Marjorie Pollack
ProMED- mail's Medical Epidemiology & Surveillance Moderator,

There is a summary Draft Issue Background Document presented to the
FDA on 12 Jan 2001 that can be found at:
<http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/01/briefing/3681b1_03.doc>

This short summary raises concerns about possible transmission to
humans. While there have been no documented cases of vCJD in the
USA, and no documented cases of vCJD linked to CWD in the USA as
yet, there is ongoing surveillance addressing this issue. CDC is
monitoring the trends and current incidence of CJD in the USA, and
there is a collaborating center for neuropathology studies on suspected
cases of CJD. A background analysis of CJD in the USA (ref. 2 and 4
below) concluded there was no epidemiologic evidence, as of 1998, of
vCJD in the USA, based on a stable rate of CJD deaths in persons less
than 45 years of age.

A report from the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance
Center at the Case Western Reserve University Division of
Neuropathology, a USA based center can be found at:
<http://www.cjdsurveillance.com/report.html> .
According to this report, during the period 1997 to 2000 there have
been no cases of vCJD identified in specimens processed by the center
(for a total of 480).

It seems highly justified to avoid eating any part of animals with signs
or suspicion of CWD, given the many unknowns as yet in the field of
prion disease and trans-species transmissibility and disease.
Surveillance activities should not be limited to hunters and their
immediate families, nor should it be limited to the under 45 year old
age group, as the population that consumes deer and elk meat is not
exclusive to these groups.

summaries of the ongoing surveillance and concerns on vCJD both
related to BSE and to other TSEs.
