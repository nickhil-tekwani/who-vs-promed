Sheep producers warned of lupin disease
---------------------------------------
Sheep farmers are being urged to protect their
livestock from a devastating lupin disease. The
Department of Agriculture and Food says 5 cases
of lupinosis have been reported in the great
southern in the past fortnight, with one farmer losing 90 sheep.

The disease is caused by a fungus and causes
severe liver damage. The department's Jeremy
Allen says flocks displaying signs of fatigue or
yellowing eyes need to be removed from their pastures immediately.

"This is a killing disease, it's a very potent
toxin and the liver damage is very, very severe,
so you could end up losing a whole flock, you've got to get them out," he said.

[Lupines (_Lupinus_ spp ) cause 2 distinct forms
of poisoning in livestockÂ—lupine poisoning and
lupinosis. The former is a nervous syndrome
caused by alkaloids present in bitter lupines;
the latter is a mycotoxic disease characterized
by liver injury and jaundice, which results
mainly from the feeding of sweet lupines.
Lupinosis is important in Australia and South
Africa and also has been reported from New
Zealand and Europe. There is increasing use of
sweet lupines, either as forage crops or through
feeding of their residues after grain harvest, as
strategic feed for sheep in Mediterranean climate
zones. Sheep, and occasionally cattle and horses,
are affected, and pigs are also susceptible.

The causal fungus is _Phomopsis
leptostromiformis_, which causes _Phomopsis_
stem-blight, especially in white and yellow
lupines; blue varieties are resistant. It
produces sunken, linear stem lesions that contain
black, stromatic masses, and it also affects the
pods and seeds. The fungus is also a saprophyte
and grows well on dead lupine material (e.g.,
haulm, pods, stubble) under favorable conditions.
It produces phomopsins as secondary metabolites
on infected lupine material, especially after
rain. Clinical changes are mainly attributable to
toxic hepatocyte injury, which causes mitotic
arrest in metaphase, isolated cell necrosis, and
hepatic enzyme leakage, with loss of metabolic and excretory function.

Early signs in sheep and cattle are inappetence
and listlessness. Complete anorexia and jaundice
follow, and ketosis is common. Cattle may show
lacrimation and salivation. Sheep may become
photosensitive. In acute outbreaks, deaths occur in 2-14 days.

In acute disease, icterus is marked. Livers are
enlarged, orange-yellow, and fatty. More chronic
cases show bronze- or tan-colored livers that are
firm, contracted in size, and fibrotic. Copious
amounts of transudates may be found in the
abdominal and thoracic cavities and in the pericardial sac.

Feeding of moldy lupine material, together with
clinical signs and increased levels of serum
liver enzymes, strongly indicate lupinosis.

Frequent surveillance of sheep and of lupine
fodder material for characteristic black spot
fungal infestation, especially after rains, is
advised. The utilization of lupine cultivars,
bred and developed for resistance to _P
leptostromiformis_ is advocated. Oral doses of
zinc (greater than or equal to 0.5 g/day) have
protected sheep against liver injury induced by phomopsins.

Treatment for affected animals is immediate
withdrawal from fields containing lupines.
Good-quality hay (without lupines), access to
shade, rest, and clean water are important. Some
veterinarians recommend other measures depending
upon severity. The livers of these animals are
affected; though the liver may regenerate, it is a slow process.

This moderator appreciates fellow toxicologist
Dr. Allen expressing the seriousness of this disease.
