News of the response
Meeting with local authorities
------------------------------
- On [Thu 23 Aug 2018], the Minister of Health, Dr Oly Ilunga, officially handed over materials to strengthen the fight against the Ebola outbreak in Mandima, Ituri province. In particular, he handed the Governor of the Province an ambulance and 13 motorcycles for surveillance and investigation. Then they visited the site in Makeke [Ituri province] where the new Ebola treatment center (ETC) will be built.
- The Minister of Health also met with the customary authorities of Mangina and Beni [North Kivu province] to appease them and reassure them of the actions carried out by the Ministry of Health to contain the virus as quickly as possible. The customary authorities, for their part, are committed to becoming more involved in raising awareness among the population.

Vaccination
-----------
- Since vaccination began on 8 Aug 2018, 2613 people have been vaccinated, including 1311 in Mabalako, 632 in Beni [North Kivu province], 626 in Mandima [Ituri province], and 44 in Oicha [North Kivu province].

Port of entry monitoring
------------------------
- Ministry of Health teams held a meeting with the Ministry of Transport and Roads of Communication to organize the awareness of traders about the risks of Ebola virus disease at trade corridors in eastern DRC.
- To date, 715 238 travelers have passed the sanitary control at the 28 entry points set up.

[2] Response
- Thu 23 Aug 2018. Ebola: Ministry of Health decides to build an ETC in Makeke [Ituri province]
[Radio Moto Butembo-Beni, in French, machine trans., excerpted, edited]
http://radiomotofm.info/lirearticle.php?billet=4609

This new Ebola treatment center, CTE [ETC] , will be built at Makeke, in the Mandima health zone in Ituri province. The announcement was made by the Minister of Public Health last weekend [18-19 Aug 2018]. It was after his last visit to Mangina [North Kivu], epicenter of the epidemic.

According to the communication service of the General Directorate for the fight against Ebola, the Minister Oly Ilunga found that the ETC of 50 beds installed in Mangina is quickly overwhelmed by patients. This center runs the risk of not being able to accommodate additional patients given the rapid increase of confirmed and suspected cases to be supported.

Thus, the response coordination made the decision to install a 2nd ETC in this area. Due to the lack of space at Mangina and the demands of the population, this new ETC will be built at Makeke, a neighboring area of Mangina, where there are also confirmed cases. The Makeke ETC will be co-managed by the Ministry of Health and International Medical Corps/ IMC, mentions the bulletin on the epidemiological situation in Ituri and North Kivu provinces.

[The excerpts in this post complement several aspects of the "News of the response" from the latest DRC MOH situation report:
The original Ebola treatment center (centre de traitement d'Ebola, CTE) in Mangina, co-managed with MSF was quickly filled to capacity, necessitating construction of another ETC in neighboring Makeke, to be co-managed with IMC. A brief glimpse of the 2 existing ETC's may be seen in the following video from TV2 Africa, a program of Voice of America, VOA: http://bit.ly/2Mt0Xlv (thanks to Greg Folkers and Mary Marshall for sending us this video). - Mod.LXL]

[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research & Policy) News, excerpted, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2018/08/who-95-ebola-case-contacts-drc-now-traced

As of [20 Aug 2018], 95 percent of case contacts in the latest Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) have been traced, according to a tweet today from Peter Salama, MD, the World Health Organization's (WHO's) deputy director-general for emergency preparedness and response.

In a graph showing the percentage of case contacts traced, Salama explained, "Dips in recent days show when work was needed to engage with communities before teams could access some areas. That work was done successfully. On 20 August, 95 percent of 1782 contacts followed-up in 3 health zones."...[more]

[Per the situation report [1], additional vehicles will be available for surveillance activities including contact tracing. That 95 percent of contacts are actually being traced is remarkable, particularly given the pre-existing armed conflict and displaced peoples in the region. A key question is: what percentage of newly diagnosed Ebola patients is coming from the cohort of known contacts? If 95 percent of contacts are being traced, then the preceding percentage should approach a similarly high figure. The DRC MOH performance metrics in its Response Plan posted yesterday [22 Aug 2018, archive no. 20180823.5981519] has a target of 100 percent for both specific aims. - Mod.LXL]

- Wed 22 Aug 2018. Uganda: anticipation of the Ebola virus disease

[Only the Overview is included; the full document is available at https://www.acaps.org/sites/acaps/files/products/files/20180822_acaps_start_drc_uganda_ebola.pdf]

Overview
--------
As of [18 Aug 2018], 91 cases of Ebola and 50 deaths (CFR 54.9 percent) have been reported in Ituri and Nord Kivu provinces of DRC. Conflict and insecurity in both areas are aggravating the crisis and increasing the risk the disease will spread further. Conflict is hampering humanitarian access of health workers to the local population, as well as driving displacement across the border to Uganda. Around 99 400 refugees from DRC have arrived in Uganda since January 2018, and the number of new refugees in Uganda from the 2 Ebola-affected provinces rose in July [2018] to 250 a day from 170 a day. The Ebola outbreak itself is also a cause for cross-border migration, as people try to leave the affected areas.

[The sheer scale of human travel and migration in this region can be appreciated by the numbers provided above: over 700 000 people passing 28 internal sanitary control check points since these were established after the North Kivu outbreak began, and close to 100 000 refugees from the DRC crossing over into Uganda so far this year (2018), with the daily numbers not surprisingly rising since the outbreak began. To be able to track such numbers in a resource-poor area is very commendable, but an unanswered question is, how complete or exhaustive are these population movement monitoring stations? Though this question may be unanswerable, what ultimately matters for epidemic control is whether susceptible contacts of Ebola patients are circumventing check points and border crossings, so the above derived percentage of 5 percent for contacts that cannot be traced may serve as a proxy estimate. - Mod.LXL
