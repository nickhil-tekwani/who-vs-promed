News Release 26 Sep 1998
Agent destroys anthrax, doesn't hurt animals or the environment
-------------------------------------------------
SAN DIEGO---BCTP looks like skim milk. Laboratory rats gain weight when they
eat it. Spray it on your lawn and the grass will thrive. But according to
tests conducted by University of Michigan scientists, this seemingly benign
material could be a potent weapon against anthrax---one of the deadliest
bacteria on Earth.
In a presentation at the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and
Chemotherapy (ICAAC) on 26 Sep 1998, Michael Hayes, research
associate in the U-M Medical School, presented experimental evidence
of BCTP's ability to destroy anthrax spores both in a culture dish
and in mice exposed to anthrax through a skin incision. James R.
Baker Jr., M.D., professor of internal medicine and director of the
Center for Biologic Nanotechnology in the U-M Medical School,
directed the research study.
BCTP was developed by D. Craig Wright, M.D., chief research scientist at
Novavax, Inc.---a bio-pharmaceutical company in Columbia, Md.---and
president of Novavax Biologics Division. According to Wright, the material
is made of water, soybean oil, Triton X 100 detergent and the solvent
tri-n-butyl phosphate.
"One of the most remarkable characteristics of this material is its ability
to rapidly destroy a wide variety of dangerous bacteria and viruses, while
remaining non-toxic to people, animals or the environment," Baker said.
BCTP's effectiveness against anthrax spores is especially significant,
because they are so difficult to kill. "Spores are like freeze-dried
bacteria," Baker explained. "Their tough outer coat is resistant to
disinfectants, freezing, drought, virtually anything we can throw at them.
Spores can survive in the environment for many years and still generate live
bacteria when given the right combination of water, nutrients and temperature."
Concentrated doses of strong disinfectants like bleach or formaldehyde will
kill anthrax spores, according to Baker. Unfortunately, they also are toxic
to people and the environment, which makes them useless for decontaminating
a person, a piece of land or equipment exposed to the bacteria.
Since the Persian Gulf War, military authorities have become increasingly
concerned about the threat anthrax and other biological warfare agents pose
both to our armed forces and civilian populations. "Anthrax is often fatal
and easily dispersed through air or water," Baker said. "We know that
countries hostile to the United States have developed strains of anthrax
which are resistant to antibiotics and existing vaccines. To counter that
threat, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), is testing
several possible new weapons against these biologic agents---including BCTP."
"When properly formulated, the components in BCTP form an emulsion of tiny
lipid droplets suspended in solvent," said Wright. "These lipids fuse with
anthrax spores causing the spore to revert to its active bacterial state.
During this process, which takes four to five hours, the spore's tough outer
membrane changes allowing BCTP's solvent to strip away the exterior
membrane. BCTP's detergent then degrades the spore's interior contents. In
scanning electron microscope images, the spores appear to explode."
In his conference presentation, Hayes described how even low concentrations
of BCTP killed more than 90 percent of virulent strains of _Bacillus
anthracis_ spores in a culture dish. "We observed sporicidal activity with
dilutions as high as one part BCTP per 1,000 parts culture media," Hayes said.
To determine its toxicity to animals, U-M scientists fed large amounts of
BCTP to laboratory rats and injected mice with the material subcutaneously.
The animals gained weight, remained healthy and suffered no adverse effects.
To determine BCTP's effectiveness at treating animals exposed to anthrax
spores, Baker's research team subcutaneously injected mice with _Bacillus
cereus_ -- a closely related species of bacteria that can be safely handled
in a university laboratory setting. Like _B. anthracis_, its lethal
relative, _B. cereus_ produces large, ulcerous areas of dead tissue if it
penetrates the skin through a cut or injury. If untreated, these skin
infections spread systemically, producing severe illness and death in 80
percent of the laboratory mice in the study.
"When we washed the animal's skin lesions with BCTP, the wounds began to
heal," Baker said. Mice receiving BCTP either simultaneously with _B.
cereus_ spores or whose wounds were washed with BCTP an hour after exposure
had a 95 percent reduction in lesion size. The death rate for mice receiving
BCTP was only 20 percent.
"Rapid inactivation of anthrax bacteria and spores combined with low
toxicity makes BCTP a promising candidate for use as a broad-spectrum,
post-exposure decontamination agent," Baker said.
In future studies, Baker plans to evaluate BCTP's effectiveness against
inhaled anthrax spores, as well as other bacteria and enveloped viruses. His
research has been funded by DARPA's Unconventional Pathogen Countermeasures
Program. The U-M and Novavax have filed a patent application covering BCTP's
use as a decontamination agent for various anti-microbial applications.
Baker is a member of the Novavax scientific advisory board, but has no
significant financial interest in the company.
