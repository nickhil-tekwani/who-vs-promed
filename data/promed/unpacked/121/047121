Subject: Comments on anthrax disease and vaccination

This post is in response to the bulletin regarding a case of anthrax
in one cow in Kinney County, Texas on 8 Sept 2006.
Colorado Serum Company is the manufacturer of the Anthrax Spore
Vaccine - Sterne Strain - and we would like to take this opportunity
to offer some technical information regarding the use and efficacy of
the vaccine.
The vaccine has been used extensively in the United States in the
face of Anthrax outbreaks for decades and has performed very
well. Each serial of vaccine has to pass USDA-APHIS-CVB required
testing for potency, safety and purity before it can be released for
use. There are many variables involved with a protective immune
response in animals and individual animals will vary in their
response to a vaccination. It should also be noted that the package
circular recommends a booster vaccination 2 - 3 weeks after the
initial vaccination in endemic and contaminated areas.
In this herd the 2nd vaccination was not given until 3 months later -
after one cow died from anthrax. When the booster vaccination is
given 2 - 3 weeks after the 1st vaccination it stimulates a very
strong memory-humoral response that may have provided enough
protective immunity to prevent the one cow from succumbing to disease
2.5 months later. It is impossible to know but chances are the
mortality rate would have been much higher if these cattle were never
vaccinated with the Anthrax Spore Vaccine.

[The Colorado Serum Company produces an excellent Sterne vaccine with
a long history of very sound reliability. Normally one shot is
adequate for cattle though some people prefer 2, as does Dr. Berrier.
Horses respond poorly sometimes, so a double shot is frequently used
with them. Frankly I am puzzled by this cow dying. And as Dr Berrier
states, if it had been vaccinated twice it would have been spared.
This has been copied to Zach Davis so that the next time he visits
this ranch he can make enquires. As he & I discovered when we
compared notes, when you get talking with one's farmers it is not
infrequent to hear, "Oh, didn't I tell you ..." and the solution,
usually simple, to the puzzle is revealed. - Mod. MHJ]
