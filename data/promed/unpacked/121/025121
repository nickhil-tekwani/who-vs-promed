In the past few days, rescue workers in various places along the coast of Zhejiang have been very busy, because cetaceans have been stranded on the tidal flats, and rescue operations have also attracted intense attention.

On 6 Jul 2021, 12 melon-headed whales [or electra dolphins, _Peponocephala electra_, Family Delphinidae] stranded collectively in Linhai Toumen Port, Taizhou, Zhejiang. After dozens of hours of intense rescue, 6 of them were successfully released, 5 unfortunately died, and one is still in weak health and receiving treatment in the breeding pond of a seafood company.

At noon on [9 Jul 2021], another 2 stranded rough-toothed dolphins were found on the beach of Zhangshu Village, Xidian Town, Ninghai, Ningbo, Zhejiang. After an afternoon of intense rescue, 2 dolphins were successfully released in the deeper part of the water in the evening of the same day.

On 11 Jul 2021, another 2 melon-headed whales ran aground at the Wenling East Sea Pond in Taizhou, Zhejiang. And it has been confirmed that it has nothing to do with the 12 melon head whales that were stranded in Toumen Port. After rescue, one of them died and the other one was transported to the deep sea for release.

Why does this happen? Why are all stranded places in Zhejiang? How should scientific rescue be done when a whale is stranded? What can we humans do to reduce the occurrence of such situations?

Experts said that according to the physical conditions of different stranded whales and dolphins, there are 3 main ways to rescue:
- Release the cetacean directly back into the ocean when its physical condition permits.
- Treat stranded whales and dolphins with water retention, and make them swim after the tide rises.
- Transfer severely injured stranded whales and dolphins to an artificial environment and release them to the ocean after they recover.

Release to the sea on the spot is of course the best case, but whales and dolphins are huge. Once stranded, they can easily fall into the mud and sand of the tidal flat. It usually takes several hours or even longer to rescue them. So, what should we do during this period of time to keep the whales and dolphins out of danger?

Hao Yujiang, Associate Researcher, Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences: "We must ensure that the animal breathes normally, so the animal's body must be straightened so that its breathing hole faces upward. In addition, because cetaceans are aquatic animals, they do not have strong limbs to support their bodies. In fact, their thoracic and abdominal cavities are under great pressure. Therefore, at this time, it is generally possible to stay in shallow water as much as possible, so that the animal has a certain amount of buoyancy to support its body.

Especially on the shallows, there is muddy water. If the animal absorbs muddy water into its respiratory tract and even into the lungs during breathing, it is easy to contract an infection. If it is serious, it may choke on the spot, so it must be cleaned up.

High temperature is also a very big threat to animals. Their skin is actually unable to withstand long-term dryness, let alone direct sunlight, so it is necessary to keep the skin moist and avoid direct sunlight.

If the stranded whales and dolphins are seriously injured, they must be medically treated. What should we do in this case?

Among the 12 melon-headed whales that ran aground on 6 Jul 2021, one was in distressing health and is currently undergoing treatment.

Rescue worker Mu Kai: "First of all, we also learned that the stranded melon-headed whale has gone through a period of fasting, and the local temperature in Zhejiang is relatively high, so we first need to give dehydrated animals enough fluids, including intravenous rehydration and oral feeding. Every day we add 7 to 9 liters of fluid to the severely ill (melon head whale) being treated.

Secondly, these animals have varying degrees of acid-base balance disorder or electrolyte balance disorder. We also use some of these fluids to correct these disorders. At present, we still suspect that it has severe gastrointestinal bleeding and caused a certain degree of organ damage. We have also given a certain degree of hemostasis, including such treatments as protecting the liver and stomach.

Experts told us that there are about 30 species of cetaceans in the South Chinese Sea, East Chinese Sea, Yellow Sea, and Bohai Sea.

Why have several recent stranding incidents happened along the coast of Zhejiang? Lin Wenzhi, Associate Researcher at the Institute of Deep Sea Science and Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences: "Based on the current information, I think there are a few certain points: First, every time a cetacean is stranded, it is not a single individual stranding, but a collective stranding of multiple individuals. Second, there are at least 2 species that have been stranded. Third, the time and place of the strandings are very close. Fourth, whether it is a melon-headed whale or a rough-toothed dolphin that is stranded, it is not a nearshore species, but lives in ocean waters hundreds to thousands of meters deep.

Based on these 4 points of information, I think that strandings have occurred one after another, most likely because of certain regional environmental incidents in the waters where these whales and dolphins live. For example, high-intensity acoustic environmental pollution, or marine water pollution, etc., caused these whales and dolphins to become disoriented and stranded.

In recent years, Australia, New Zealand, and other countries have successively seen large-scale strandings of cetaceans and dolphins. Although the exact reason is always a mystery, there is no doubt that human activities will affect many marine life species, including whales. What can humans do to reduce the number of stranded whales?

Lin Wenzhi, Associate Researcher at the Institute of Deep Sea Science and Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences: "As we all know, human activities will have a profound impact on the marine environment, including global warming which will cause the acidification of the marine environment, marine shipping will cause underwater noise pollution, and microplastics. Pollution caused by marine garbage in the interior and so on. The coastal environment of the ocean will be more affected, such as overfishing of marine life, discharge of domestic sewage, and so on. One very important thing we can do is to leave the resources for wild animals to live, including space resources, food, and environmental resources, in the process of seeking human development to obtain an optimal balance between economic development and environmental protection."

[Mass strandings of cetaceans are considered to be due to a complex set of variables in which behavioral factors are probably important. In these phenomena, there are interactions of physical conditions (weather, tides, currents, coastline, acoustic contamination) and biological conditions (predators, feeding, disturbance of echolocation, and disease), and they are also affected by red tide toxins.
