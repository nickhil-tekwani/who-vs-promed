Highly pathogenic avian influenza, Russia
-----------------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 25 Dec 2014 from Dr Evgeny Nepoklonov, deputy head, Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance, Ministry of Agriculture, Moscow, Russia

Summary:
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 25 Sep 2014
Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 11 Dec 2014
Reason for notification: new strain of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: December 2012
Manifestation of disease: sub-clinical infection
Causal agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza virus
Serotype: H5N8
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (basic) laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks (1)
Outbreak 1: Belaya Gora, Abyjsky, Resoublika Sakha (Yakutiya)
Date of start of the outbreak: 25 Sep 2014
Outbreak status: Resolved (3 Oct 2014)
Epidemiological unit: not applicable
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Eurasian Wigeon: _Anas Penelope_ (Anatidae) / - / 1 / 0 / 1 / 0
Affected population: domestic chickens, geese, ducks

Epidemiology:
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5 was identified in a sample (trachea) from hunted healthy Eurasian Wigeon through monitoring activities organized by Russian Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing (Rospotrebnadzor). Preliminary analysis suggests this H5N8 is similar to the HPAIVs identified in the Asian-Pacific region and Europe, as some HA and NA genes fragments are consistent with current HPAI H5N8 virus. Further investigation of this HPAI virus, including pathogenicity tests in chickens and full genome sequencing, will be done in the Federal Centre for Animal Health (FGBI ARRIAH), Vladimir in the nearest future. No HPAI H5N8 virus has been detected in poultry in the Russian Federation.

Control measures
Measures applied: control of wildlife reservoirs; screening; no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type
Federal Scientific Centre of Virology and Biotechnology "Vector," Novosibirsk (National laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Eurasian Wigeon / virus isolation / 11 Dec 2014 / Positive
Eurasian Wigeon / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 11 Dec 2014 / Positive

Future Reporting:
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[The Eurasian wigeon, also known as widgeon or Eurasian widgeon (_Anas penelope_, previously _Mareca penelope_) is one of 3 species of wigeon in the dabbling duck genus _Anas_. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_wigeon

Eurasian wigeons breed from Iceland, the British Isles and Scandinavia east to eastern Siberia and Kamchatka, and south to northern Europe, central Russia and northern China.

The majority of Eurasian wigeons winter from Iceland, the British Isles, northern Europe, southern Russia and Japan south to the eastern Atlantic islands, Africa, Arabia, India, the Malay Peninsula, southern China, Formosa and the Philippines. In North America, the Eurasian wigeon is an occasional visitor to the Pacific coast, from southeastern Alaska to northern Baja California, and the Atlantic-Gulf coast, from Labrador and Newfoundland south to Florida and west to southern Texas. http://www.ducks.org/hunting/waterfowl-id/eurasian-wigeon#ad-image-0
