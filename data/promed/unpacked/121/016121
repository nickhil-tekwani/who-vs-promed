We seem to face dangers at every level of our lives. Now we have a new addition to this list. According to the KP Livestock Department in a document shared with this newspaper, the Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic fever virus, better known as the Congo virus, has spread through animal markets in Peshawar where livestock in large numbers have been brought ahead of Eidul Azha [or Eid Al-Adha, an Islamic holiday marking the end of the Hajj]. Reports say that 9 people have already died after contracting the virus, which is almost invariably fatal. Most of our hospitals lack the knowledge which may in some cases enable people to survive 1 of the most deadly diseases in the world.

There is apprehension that the risk could increase as the circulation of animals becomes more widespread ahead of Eid. People keeping livestock at home also face a risk. The virus is transmitted through contact with the bodily fluids of the animal -- including blood -- at the time of slaughter, but is more often passed to humans through a tick that lives on the hind of the animals and carries the fatal disease.

We evidently need to create, at the very least, greater awareness about the risk that has been brought by the large influx of animals into a city like Peshawar. Those who are in frequent contact with animals, including the keepers of livestock, vets, poachers and others, are most at risk. We have had outbreaks of the virus before. In many cases, doctors at hospitals have been mystified by the disease and treatment has begun too late. Given the situation that now prevails in Peshawar, it is important that all hospitals in the city be put on alert.

The virus is rarely transmitted from human to human, but this can happen when there is contact with body fluids. Given that Eid lies just days away, there is little time to lose. The health authorities need to take action; animals in livestock places should be tested and if necessary put down, and their human handlers warned about the risks. The Congo virus is not a disease we can risk playing about with. The danger is very real.

[CCHF virus is endemic in Pakistan. Cases of CCHF occurred in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 2 as recently as 12 Sep 2015, and in Sindh provinces this year (2015) and in various parts of Pakistan last year (2014). With significant livestock movements into urban areas in preparation of the feast celebrating the Eid, there is a significant risk of infection for those involved in slaughtering the animals and others in contact with the bodily fluids of those animals. Health care workers attending CCHF patients also need to be aware of their risk of infection in coming into contact with blood.

The virus can cause severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 percent (although serious, not "almost invariably fatal" as the above report states). The virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp. ticks or through contact with infected human blood or animal blood and tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Exposure in health care facilities can also occur.

The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days.

CCHF virus is a tickborne virus in the genus _Nairovirus_, family _Bunyaviridae_.

Peshawar is located in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. A map showing the location of Peshawar in Pakistan can be found at the above URL.
