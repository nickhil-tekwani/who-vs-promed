A case of avian influenza was confirmed on a duck breeding farm in Yorkshire on 16 Nov 2014. Immediate action has been taken, including introducing a 10 km [6 mi] restriction zone and culling all poultry on the farm to prevent any potential spread of infection. [The official declaration, including a map on page 12, is available at https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/375553/ai-pz-driffield-1411016.pdf]

Some strains of avian influenza cause a notifiable disease. If you suspect any strain of avian influenza you must tell your nearest Animal and Plant and Health Agency (APHA) office immediately [http://www.defra.gov.uk/ahvla-en/about-us/contact-us/field-services/]. Failure to do so is an offence.

How to spot avian influenza
---------------------------
There are 2 types of avian influenza.

1. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is the more serious type. It is often fatal in birds. The main clinical signs of HPAI in birds are:
swollen head, blue discolouration of neck and throat, loss of appetite, respiratory distress (such as gaping beak, coughing, sneezing, gurgling, rattling), diarrhoea, and fewer eggs laid

2. Low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) is usually less serious. It can cause mild breathing problems, but affected birds will not always show clear signs of infection. The severity of LPAI depends on the type of bird and whether it has any other illnesses.

Risk to humans
--------------
Some strains of avian influenza can pass to humans, but this is very rare. It usually requires very close contact between the human and infected birds.

The Food Standards Agency advises that properly cooked poultry and poultry products, including eggs, are safe to eat.

For more information on avian influenza in humans, read Public Health England's advice [http://bit.ly/1t2OY8l].

If you employ people who work with poultry or work with poultry yourself, you can also read advice from the Health and Safety Executive on protecting workers from avian influenza [http://bit.ly/1xx2WXr].

How avian influenza is spread
-----------------------------
The disease spreads from bird to bird by direct contact or through contaminated body fluids and faeces.

The avian influenza virus changes frequently, creating new strains, and there is a constant risk that one of the new strains may spread among people.

But there is no evidence that any recent strain of avian influenza has been able to spread directly between humans.

Avian influenza isn't an airborne disease.

Preventing and controlling avian influenza
------------------------------------------
APHA surveys birds for certain strains of avian influenza once a year, to check if the disease is present in Great Britain. APHA officers will contact you if they need to take blood samples from your birds.

You can help prevent avian influenza by practising strict biosecurity on your premises [http://bit.ly/1zvP25U].

You should follow guidance on handling and disposing of dead birds:
[http://bit.ly/1xdNCxq].

If you suspect avian influenza, APHA vets will investigate.

If avian influenza is confirmed it will be controlled in line with the contingency plan for exotic notifiable diseases [http://bit.ly/1A7a7GY] and the avian influenza control strategy will be implemented [http://bit.ly/1xHNplo}.

A case of bird flu has been confirmed at a duck breeding farm in East Yorkshire, officials have said.

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the risk to public health was very low. The poultry is being culled and a 10 km (6 mile) exclusion zone is in place.

The exact strain has not been confirmed but the H5N1 form, deadly to humans, has been ruled out by Defra officials.

The virus spreads between birds and, in rare cases, can affect humans.

The case is the 1st in the UK since 2008, when chickens on a farm in Banbury, Oxfordshire tested positive for the virus.

On [Sun 16 Nov 2014] , an outbreak of a highly contagious strain of bird flu was discovered at a poultry farm in the Netherlands [serotyped H5N8]. The Dutch government has temporarily banned the transport of poultry and eggs.

The exclusion zone around the farm in the Driffield area of East Yorkshire will prevent all poultry and poultry waste being transferred in or out of the area, and some 6000 ducks will be culled, Defra told BBC News.

It said the flu strain had been identified as the H5 virus, stressing that it was not the H5N1 strain.

[The report does not disclose the clinical findings in the affected breeding duck flock. Even if signs are mild (such as reduced laying rate, inappetence) or absent (subclinical), the causative agent could be either LPAI or HPAI H5 virus strains. Water birds, including ducks, may show mild clinical signs even if the strain is highly pathogenic for susceptible poultry species (such as chickens, turkeys). A recent experimental infection trial with the novel reassortant influenza A (H5N8) virus from South Korea led to moderate disease (0-20 per cent mortality rate) in domestic ducks; in wild mallard ducks, it did not cause severe illness or death (see item 2 in ProMED-mail archive no 20141115.2957974).

The serotyping and pathogenicity index of the avian influenza H5 virus strain involved in the described outbreak in a breeding duck farm in Yorkshire, as well as clinical observations, are anticipated. - Mod.AS
