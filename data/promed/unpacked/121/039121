A suspected yellow fever death was registered in Parana [ex Goias. - Mod.TY]
---------------------------------------------------
The Parana Health Secretariat on Wednesday [9 Dec 2007] received
notification of the death of a man in Maringa who is a suspected
yellow fever [case and] who died on Tuesday [8 Jan 2007]. However,
the symptoms presented by this patient, according to the agency, are
the same as cases of hantavirus infection, yellow fever, dengue and
leptospirosis. Although laboratory tests are being done with urgency,
due to their complexity it will take 15 days to get the results.
According to the agency, the suspicion of yellow fever in this case
was brought up because the patient was in a [yellow fever] risk area,
in the city of Caldas Novas in Goias, between 20 Dec [2007] and 1 Jan
[2008].
According to the Secretariat [of Health] no cases of yellow fever
have been reported in the state [of Parana]. Routine vaccination in
the state will be maintained for travelers who go to endemic
[Brazilian yellow fever] areas (northern region, and the states of
Maranhao and Minas Gerais) and transitional regions (western Parana,
Santa Catarina, Piaui and Sao Paulo, as well as for Latin American
countries.

[The incubation period (time from inoculation of the virus by the
mosquito vector to the 1st appearance of symptoms) for yellow fever
virus infections is 3-6 days. Assuming that the patient was ill
several days before his death, the time of acquisition of the virus
fits within the dates when the patient was in Goias, where a
suspected yellow fever outbreak in monkeys was occurring.
