Sounds very similar to ascending paralysis caused by infestation with
_Ixodes
Holocyclus_ in Australia. Tick serum given early in the disease very
effective. Acepromazine, suposedly because of its hypotensive properties is
used. It probably simply relieves distress and so aids in more regular
respiratory efforts by stopping agitated behavior. Holcyclus will kill any
animal up to the size of mature sheep including human infants. Serum should
be given intravenously for maximum effect. Intraperitoneal administration
will work but not as effective. Mature stage female ticks are the danger.
They engorge and then inject their toxin,drop off and lay their eggs. The
big problem will be other hosts on the island acting as source of larval
ticks in future years especially if weather conditions (warm wet weather)
are favourable to the hatching of larval ticks, (assuming this tick is not
host specific -- which is unlikely). Much folk law concerning removal of
ticks. Killing tick with Organophosphates supposedly causes tick to inject
toxin. Safest method seems to be to remove ticks with forceps applied as
close to skin as possible. Some recommend killing tick first with
pyrethroid preparations before removal.

It is possible the albatross are being affected by a tick paralysis (see
below about tick fever) as a number of species of ticks, many of them
Ixodid ticks, produce a toxin capable of such an effect. In domestic
poultry the most common one to do this is _Argus persicus_. It is usually
an ascending paralysis and takes a few days to kill them, depending on the
number of tick present. A low number may not kill but enable some immunity
to develop to the toxin.
The anti-tick vaccine mentioned stimulates antibody within the cattle
against the gut antigens of the tick and as the tick feeds these inhibit
the proper functioning of this organ. It is, of course, aimed at
Boophilus, the cattle tick and the problem reported appears to be related
to an Ixodes.
There was a vaccine produced against tick fever in birds caused by Borrelia
anserina, this product is no longer made. This latter disease causes some
confusion because the birds may also show paralysis but it is the tick
toxin doing this while the birds are dying more acutely from the spirochete
infection.
It is also not essential to actually get the tick out to prevent the
continuation of the paralysis. Once the tick is dead. it is no longer
injecting the saliva containing the toxin, so insecticidal treatment will
work.
Malathion (maldison) is the most commonly used insecticide based on cost
and
efficacy but the ivermectins would probably be effective and safer.
Although they may not be registered for use on birds, the manufacturers are
sure to have some dose rates for their use.
[While individual animal treatment prefers manual tick removal, herd/flock
veterinarians must look for effective mass treatments and hence the
emphasis on insecticides. - Mod. pc]
