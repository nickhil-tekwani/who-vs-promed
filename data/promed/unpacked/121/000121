Some confusion still exists pertaining to the taxonomy of "elk" in North
America in a 99 issue of ProMED-mail. First, I believe that the North
American elk species in question is what is commonly referred to as Rocky
Mountain elk or wapiti. The current scientific name for this species is
_Cervus elaphus_. This has been the case for some time now. Roosevelt elk
(_C. elaphus roosevelti_) are common in the Pacific Northwest region of the
United States and remnant populations of tule elk (_C. elaphus
nannodes_)still exist in California. It appears that some confusion about
the latter still exists. In literature from the 1990's, this subspecies was
termed as _C. elaphus nannodes_, _C. nannodes_, and _C. canadensis.
However, _C. elaphus nannodes_ is by far the most commonly used Latin name
in the literature at this time.
I agree that there is an imperative need to use the Latin name of an animal
when discussing it. However, using the proper literature to get this
information is also imperative. Field guides are typically highly
discouraged if not barred for use as citations in ecological-type journals.
The use of more recent literature from well-accepted sources would help to
alleviate this problem.
Some examples include:
Wilson, D. E., and D. M. Reeder (eds). 1993. Mammal Species of the World.
Smithsonian Institution Press, 1206 pp. (Available from Smithsonian
Institution Press, 1-800-782-4612 or
703-435-7809.)
Hall, E. R. 1981. The mammals of North America. Wiley, New York, NY. ?
pp. (An excellent reference, but this volume is nearly two decades old
now). [Furthermore, it is likely out of print and getting quite old itself.
Fitzgerald, J.P., C.A. Meaney, and D.M. Armstrong. 1994. Mammals of
Colorado. Denver Museum of Natural History and Univ. Press of Colorado,
Niwot, CO. 467 pp.

There are many other excellent state taxonomy books not listed here.

The use of the taxonomic name _Cervus canadensis_ to describe the
NorthAmerican Elk in a recent posting is not current.The animal is actually
a member of the genus _Cervus _, but considered a member of the species
_elaphus_. _C. elaphus_ consists of red deer and wapiti (N. American elk),
which are both members of the sub-family Cervinae. If writers stick to the
word wapiti (derived from a Shawnee word in reference to the white rump),
there will be no confusion with the term elk, (which is variously rendered
in Europe as elch, alg, and no doubt others), and of course refers to
_Alces alces_ (the moose, in English), and its subspecies.
The type species of _Cervus elaphus_ is the red deer. In North America
there are four extant subspecies of this animal. These are _C.e.nelsoni_,
_C.e. nannodes_, _C.e. manitobensis_, and _C.e. roosevelti_.
It is of course possible that DNA work currently in progress will
distinguish between red deer and wapiti and that they may end up as
separate species. However, for now, the species should be called _Cervus
elaphus_. By and large they consist of a kline that starts at its smallest
in Scotland, and gets bigger as one goes eastwards. The splitters have them
in many sub-species. There is no doubt at all that an animal as large as
the North American races exists in Mongolia
By using _Cervus canadensis_ there is a real chance for confusion as there
are two extinct subspecies of wapiti. One is _C.e.canadensis_, the other
_C.e.merriami_.
For more details consult Farming Wapiti and Red Deer, 1993. Haigh JC and
Hudson RJ. Mosby Year Book.
On an epidemiological note, the spread of brucellosis among wapiti in the
USA has occurred when animals eat fodder contaminated with periparturient
fluids containing _Brucella abortus_. The high concentrations of the
animals on feeding grounds, and the abortions that do occur in infected
animals are at the root of the problem. In animals that live elsewhere,
where winter feeding is not occurring, do not seem to sustain brucellosis
in the wild. This may be due to the fact that normal calving behaviour of
wapiti consists of a period from some 24- 48 hours before delivery when the
female seeks solitude. She may not return to the herd for a couple of
weeks. She will certainly lick her calf, even as it is being born, graze
any grass where birthing fluids are passed and then clean off and eat the
fetal membranes followed by the placenta proper. For a reference consult
Thorne, E.T, Brucellsois. In: Diseases of Wildlife in Wyoming. 1982.
eds. Thorne, Kingston, Jolley & Bergstrom. publ. Wyoming Game & Fish Dept.
A note on placenta eating. Although most people consider that this is an
anti-predator behaviour, there are almost certainly another, and perhaps
more fundamental reasons for this behaviour in almost all terrestrial
eutherian mammals (S. American camelids are an exception)
