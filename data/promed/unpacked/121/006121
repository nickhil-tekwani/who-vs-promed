Hemorrhagic disease is once again plaguing deer throughout the state,
but wildlife officials say the outbreak of the illness -- which can
produce high fevers and mouth and hoof lesions, among other things --
is minor and shouldn't have a big impact on the remainder of hunting
season.

The last major outbreak of epizootic hemorrhagic disease, or EHD, was
in 2000, though the virus for the illness is always present in the
white-tailed deer population.

Officials with the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission said
while the state typically sees large outbreaks about every 10 years,
the current flare-up is relatively minor.

"You could lose up to 25 percent of your herd to this disease in a
real severe outbreak. At this point, I don't anticipate it being that
high," said commission biologist Robbie Norville, who has confirmed a
total of 30 EHD cases in the eastern part of the state. "That's pretty
miniscule."

Deer come down with EHD after being bitten by midges, tiny insects
similar to gnats. The recent proliferation of the illness could be the
result of an extremely dry summer followed by extensive rains during
Hurricane Irene [August 2011], which produced the ideal breeding
environment for the insects. "The conditions were definitely right for
this midge population," Norville said.

But the disease isn't always fatal to deer, and because EHD can't be
passed to humans, most animals afflicted with the illness are still
safe to eat.

Deer with EHD display a wide variety of signs, ranging from mouth
lesions to cracked hooves. Norville said the only warning flag for
hunters is an extremely thin or malnourished deer.

"It would be much like you or I having the flu. We get over the flu
virus, but our bodies are not fully recovered, and then we get
pneumonia. It can happen in deer as well," he said. "There are other
factors that happen that impair the deer's ability to digest food
properly so they become quite emaciated. I tell my hunters if you
harvest one like that, don't eat it."

This year's [2011] deer-hunting season in North Carolina started on
the 2nd Saturday in September and ends on 2 Jan 2012. Norville said
the state typically begins receiving calls about EHD in mid-September,
shortly after the midges begin popping up. "But this year we didn't
get many calls early," he said. "It was hot, and people were still
recovering from Hurricane Irene."

[The midges that cause EHD, and the vectors that cause other diseases
were transported relatively far northward by Hurricane Irene. It is
also not unusual for people trying to recover from events such as a
hurricane to be more focused on their own issues than on sick deer.

We certainly hope the EHD season is a short one. Typically, frost
tends to decrease the vectors and the disease stops.
