C. Iran: 978 cases, 54 deaths
Date: Mon 2 Mar 2020 1:18 PM GST

https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-iran/coronavirus-death-toll-reaches-66-in-iran-includes-a-senior-official-idUKKBN20P1OV


Iranian authorities uncovered a stash of hoarded medical supplies including millions of gloves as deaths from its coronavirus epidemic hit 66, including a senior official. A World Health Organization (WHO) technical team flew into Tehran to help with the response in the country with the most deaths outside China, where the flu-like disease originated.

Deputy health minister Alireza Raisi announced on state television 523 new infections and 12 new deaths, giving a total of 1501 cases and 66 fatalities. Among the dead was Mohammad Mirmohammadi, a member of the Expediency Council, intended to resolve disputes between parliament and the Guardian Council, a governmental body that vets electoral candidates among other duties, Tasnim news agency said. Several other senior officials have been infected including Masoumeh Ebtekar, the vice president for women and family affairs, and deputy health minister Iraj Harirchi.

Government spokesman Ali Rabiei said a closure of schools announced on Saturday [29 Feb 2020] would continue through the end of this week, the official IRNA news agency reported.

The hoarded supplies, including 28 million medical gloves, were found in 2 warehouses in Kahrizak, a town about 25 km [15.5 mi] south of Tehran, a Revolutionary Guards commander, Hassan Hassanzadeh, told the Fars news agency. Pharmacies are short of gloves and other supplies. Anyone found hoarding medical supplies will be dealt with harshly, Iran's judiciary chief Ebrahim Raisi said on Monday [2 Mar 2020], according to Mizan, the news site of the judiciary. "Show no mercy to hoarders of medicine and medical supplies," Raisi said in a message to prosecutors.

During its week-long visit, the 4-person WHO team is to meet health officials and visit facilities and laboratories dealing with the coronavirus outbreak.

Several countries in the region have reported coronavirus infections in people who have visited Iran. Among them was Saudi Arabia which on Monday [2 Mar 2020] announced its 1st case of the new coronavirus -- a person that had come from Iran through Bahrain, the health ministry said, according to the state news agency. Kuwait's health ministry on Monday [2 Mar 2020] also reported 10 new cases in the last 24 hours, all of whom had been in Iran. Qatar's health ministry said on Monday [2 Mar 2020] that 4 more people had been diagnosed with coronavirus, among a group who were evacuated by the government on a private plane from Iran on [27 Feb 2020]. That raised total cases in Qatar to 7.

The United Arab Emirates sent a shipment of medical supplies, including gloves and surgical masks, to Iran on Monday [2 Mar 2020], state news agency WAM reported.

[5] Selected media reports of interest
A. USA (Washington State, Georgia, New York, Florida, Rhode Island)
Date: Mon 2 Mar 2020 10:15 PM ET
Source: NPR (National Public Radio) [edited]
https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/02/811161998/coronavirus-2nd-person-dies-in-u-s-new-cases-reported-in-florida-and-new-york


Another 4 people in the Seattle area have died after contracting COVID-19, health officials say, bringing the total in both Washington state and the US to 6. The state now has a total of 18 cases. 3 of the people who died were residents of King County, Washington, which now has 14 confirmed cases of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. The 4th person had been living in Snohomish County, north of Seattle. That county has a total of 4 cases. All 6 of the deaths occurred at the EvergreenHealth hospital in Kirkland. The deaths that were announced Monday [2 Mar 2020] include 3 women -- 2 in their 80s and 1 in her 70s. The 4th patient was a man in his 40s, according to the Snohomish County Health District.

King County's health department had reported Washington state's 1st 2 deaths from the respiratory illness over the weekend [29 Feb-1 Mar 2020]. At least 3 of the people who died had been living at a nursing facility that is now suspected of being the site of America's 1st outbreak of the new coronavirus. Dozens of other people have shown symptoms of COVID-19 at that facility, the Life Care Center of Kirkland. The nursing center northeast of Seattle says anyone with symptoms is being isolated under infection control protocols, but it notes that at this time of year, colds and flu-like symptoms are common.

Dr Kathy Lofy, state health officer at the Washington State Department of Health, warns that it's possible new cases will appear in more counties. "Unfortunately, we are now starting to find more COVID-19 cases in Washington that appear to be acquired locally," Lofy said. "We now know that the virus is actively spreading in some communities here in Washington." Washington's public health lab now has the capacity to test about 200 potential cases a day, Lofy said, adding that the state agency is working to help more labs get ready to test for COVID-19. A lab at the University of Washington will begin testing for the virus on Tuesday [3 Mar 2020], a move that Lofy said would "add tremendous capacity" for testing.

"A team of CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] officials is on the ground" in King County to help the local effort, according to the county's health department, Public Health -- Seattle & King County. "At this time, we are not recommending widespread school closures or cancellation of activities at schools," the agency said. "If there is a positive case at a school, we will be working [to] provide guidance."

There are currently at least 93 cases of the coronavirus illness in the US - including 48 cases among people repatriated from China and from the Diamond Princess cruise ship -- according to CDC. Late Monday [2 Mar 2020], Georgia reported 2 cases in the same household. One of the patients had traveled to Italy. Officials in the state said both patients from the Atlanta area had experienced only mild symptoms and were being isolated in their home.

Over the weekend [29 Feb-1 Mar 2020], health officials reported the 1st confirmed COVID-19 cases in Florida, New York, and Rhode Island. "Florida has 2 presumptive positive #COVID19 cases," the Florida Department of Health said via Twitter. "One adult resident of Hillsborough County and one adult resident of Manatee County. Both individuals are isolated and being appropriately cared for." The New York case involves a woman in her 30s who had recently traveled to Iran and is now isolated in her home. While she has symptoms of COVID-19, she is not in serious condition and "has been in a controlled situation since arriving to New York," governor Andrew Cuomo said in a statement. In the Rhode Island case, the patient "is in their 40s and had traveled to Italy in mid-February [2020]," the Rhode Island Department of Health said. It added that CDC is working to trace people who were on the patient's return flight to the United States.

The coronavirus illness is likely to continue to spread in the US, health officials say. In a sign of that, cases of "community spread" -- among people with no history of travel to affected areas and no contact with people known to be infected -- have now been reported in California, Washington state, and Oregon.

Health officials expect more coronavirus cases to be reported in the US as more labs across the country add the ability to test for the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. The health departments in New York and Rhode Island had only recently gained the ability to test for the virus; for weeks, CDC was the only US agency capable of carrying out such tests. As more labs test for the virus, their results are being reported as presumptive, with the federal agency still relied on for a final confirmation.

To prevent the virus from spreading, experts recommend the same measures that limit any virus, from washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds to coughing in elbows and avoiding handshakes. CDC says it "does not recommend that people who are well wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19." COVID-19's commonest symptoms include fever, shortness of breath and a dry cough, says WHO. And in most cases, people don't develop a serious illness.

"Most patients (80%) experienced mild illness," WHO said in a recent update on the coronavirus. "Approximately 14% experienced severe disease and 5% were critically ill." There are currently about 90 000 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus in the world. Of that number, slightly more than half -- nearly 45 400 people -- have recovered from the virus. But more than 3000 people have died.

[Reading between the lines the next stage in the identification of cases is most likely related to seeking and finding. Now that community spread has been identified, the challenge for containment is to identify all contacts of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals and test and isolate them to break the chain of transmission. Not an easy feat in a society that values civil/individual rights and freedoms. - Mod.MPP

https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/20200302-sitrep-42-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=d863e045_2


*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10 a.m. CET.

Highlights
----------
- Six new member states (Armenia, Czechia, Dominican Republic, Luxembourg, Iceland, and Indonesia) have reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.

- A team of WHO experts has arrived in Tehran, Iran to support the COVID-19 response. The objectives are to identify transmission dynamics and at-risk populations and provide technical guidance. Further information can be found at http://www.emro.who.int/irn/iran-news/who-team-arrives-in-tehran-to-support-the-covid-19-response.html.

- Containment remains the top priority for all countries. Management for COVID-19 globally, however, is not a one-size-fits-all approach and must be tailored to the transmission scenario a country faces. Early robust measures are key to saving lives and halting transmission, notes the WHO director-general. More information can be found at https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---2-march-2020.

- WHO's Operations Supply and Logistics team are working across numerous areas to support the COVID-19 response. Activities include working to establish a Supply Chain Coordination Cell and providing a technical briefing for G20 members on the personal protective equipment (PPE) market situation. More information can be found in the Subject in Focus below.

Subject in focus: update on operations supply and logistics
-----------------------------------------------------------
The WHO Operations Supply and Logistics (OSL) team continues to work across numerous areas to support emergency operations within a tightening market for supplies essential for the COVID-19 response.

Recent OSL activities are as follows:
- Together with the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the World Bank, WHO is working on a proposal to establish a Supply Chain Coordination Cell. This interagency team will help improve information management and coordination to support strategic guidance, operational decision-making, and overall monitoring.

- WHO has contacted the Global Health Security Initiative to address access to strategic national stockpiles. WHO is also engaging with the Gates Foundation, the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), the World Bank and UNICEF, both as part of the Supply Chain Coordination Cell and to establish bridge financing mechanisms, data access and analysis to support planning, forecasting, and market access.

- Weekly meetings of the Pandemic Supply Chain Partnership Network (PSCN) continue, along with bilateral discussions with manufacturers and distributors to advocate for the release and prioritization of supplies for the health care response. A technical briefing on the personal protective equipment (PPE) market situation is planned for G20 members next week, and PSCN members will engage with WFP to develop infection prevention and control (IPC) technical guidance on cargo handling.

- In cooperation with the International Humanitarian City in Dubai and with aircraft provided by the government of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), WHO has organized a flight from Dubai to Iran to support the first delivery of emergency PPE and laboratory tests.

- Since [14 Feb 2020], WHO has shipped PPE to more than 47 countries, and there are currently 22 additional countries to which PPE shipments are ready to be made. WHO has also shipped laboratory testing equipment to 93 countries.

*Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.
**Transmission classification is based on WHO analysis of available official data and may be subject to reclassification as additional data become available. Countries/territories/areas experiencing multiple types of transmission are classified in the highest category for which there is evidence; they may be removed from a given category if interruption of transmission can be demonstrated. It should be noted that even within categories, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and other factors. Not all locations within a given country/territory/area are equally affected.

Terms:
- Community transmission is evidenced by the inability to relate confirmed cases through chains of transmission for a large number of cases, or by increasing positive tests through routine screening of sentinel samples.
- Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.
- Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.
- Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.
- Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined).

[The number of countries reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside China continues to grow and now totals 64. This includes 9 countries from the Western Pacific region, 31 countries from the European region, 5 countries from the Southeast Asia region, 11 countries from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 6 countries from the Americas region, and 2 countries from the African region. 26 countries are listed as having local transmission within their countries with Finland, Switzerland, Denmark, and Greece reporting local transmission for the 1st time in the past 24 hours. There has also been local transmission noted on the cruise ship quarantined in Japan (the Diamond Princess).

The total number of cases reported from outside of China is now 8774 including 128 deaths.

Notable observations pointed out by the WHO director-general In today's (2 Mar 2020) briefing:
- in the past 24 hours almost 9 times more cases reported outside China than inside China;
- epidemics in Republic of Korea, Italy, Iran, and Japan are the greatest concern;
- the cases in the Republic of Korea appear to be coming mostly from suspected cases from the 5 known clusters, rather than the community;
- of the 88 913 cases reported globally so far, 90% are in China, mostly in 1 province;
- of the 8739 cases reported outside China, 81% are from 4 countries;
- of the other 57 affected countries, 38 have reported 10 cases or less, 19 have reported only one case, and a good number of countries have already contained the virus and have not reported in the last 2 weeks.
(https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---2-march-2020)

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: it is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time I've accessed the Johns Hopkins website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. - Mod.MPP]
