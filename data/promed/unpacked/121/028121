Tanzania: Rift Valley fever death toll now 89
-----------------------------------------------
A total of 89 people have so far died of Rift Valley fever (RVF),
Prime Minister (PM) Edward Lowassa said yesterday [20 Apr 2007].
Adjourning the 7th Bunge [parliament] session here yesterday, Lowassa
said out of that number, 56 were from the Dodoma Region. The PM said
some 249 people had contracted the disease since it was 1st reported
in the country in January this year [2007]. He said 73 patients had
been treated and discharged, while 87 remain in hospital. The PM said
Dodoma was the most affected region, with 55 people still being
admitted to hospital.
He said 46 600 cows, 56 900 goats and 32 800 sheep had been affected
by the disease. He said 5580 cows, 6866 goats and 3898 sheep had died
of the disease.
The PM said 1 620 000 doses of vaccine had been received so far and
distributed to 37 districts. A total of TZS 1.7 billion [USD 1.3
million] has been spent for the purpose. He said the government had
suspended cattle auctions and made dipping services compulsory in a
bid to control the disease.
The government will continue with a public education campaign to
educate people on how to avoid the disease.

[Since previous government statements, the human death toll from Rift
Valley fever has increased to 89 from a figure variously given as
31-37 in early April 2007. It is clear that the outbreak has not yet
been contained and that the Dodoma remains the most severely affected
region of Tanzania.
