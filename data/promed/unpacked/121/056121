The number of cases of hand, foot and mouth disease rose dramatically in the 1st 9 months of this year [2013], and more adults are getting sick. More than 4200 cases of the disease were reported in the city, overtaking the total of the previous 2 years combined [2011-2012]. The viral infection mainly affects children, but doctors have recently been seeing more cases in adults.

Academy of Medicine president Dr Donald Li Kwok-tung said the large number of outbreaks might be related to humid weather and a low overall immunity in the population. "In the past, we hardly ever saw cases in adults, but recently we have been seeing more," said the family medicine specialist. "It may be due to a generally lower resistance against infections in the population, especially when people are tired and stressed."

Laboratory tests by the Department of Health found no unusual genetic characteristics in recent viruses causing the disease, but Li said there might still be slight changes in the viral strains that resulted in people having no immunity to them. Both children and adults who catch the disease usually have a fever, develop painful ulcers inside the mouth and get a rash with vesicles on the hands and feet. The disease is mostly self-limiting and sufferers recover within a week. Severe cases may develop complications like viral meningitis or encephalitis which could lead to death. There were 5 such cases this year [2013], but no fatalities so far [this year]. Li explained that the disease seldom occurred in adults because most acquired immunity at young age. Medical Association president, paediatrician Tse Hung-hing, also noticed more adult cases recently, and generally agreed with Li's explanations.

The Department of Health said the government did not keep age records of the reported cases. The disease was not a statutorily notifiable disease in Hong Kong and only institutions were encouraged to report outbreaks. As of Wednesday [2 Oct 2013], 652 outbreaks had been reported from institutions such as schools and homes for the elderly, with a total of 4246 people contracting the disease this year. There were 2216 affected people last year [2012] and 1370 in 2011. The usual peak season for hand, foot and mouth disease is in May to July. This year, the number of cases started climbing in May, fell in July, and rose to another peak in September.

Chinese University paediatrics professor Ellis Hon Kam-lun said the virus was mainly transmitted through touching the saliva or faeces of infected people. Parents should avoid taking their children to crowded places if possible, and sick children should stay at home.

[The following figures posted by the Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection support the statement that more than 4200 cases of the disease were reported in the city, overtaking the total of the previous 2 years combined.

Year / no. of institutions affected / no. of cases
2008 / 157 / 967
2009 / 103 / 727
2010 / 851 / 5025
2011 / 253 / 1370
2012 / 382 / 2216
2013 / 652 / 4256 (as of 2 Oct 2013)

No information has been provided concerning the identity of the virus or viruses responsible for this or the previous outbreaks in Hong Kong. Hand, foot and mouth disease is generally associated with enteric viruses such as coxsackievirus A16 and human enterovirus 71, but can occur in any situation where it is difficult to maintain high standards of personal hygiene, such as daycare centres and the like. Illness is of short duration and rarely has serious outcomes. For this reason, hand, foot and mouth disease outbreaks are not routinely reported by ProMED-mail. However, human enterovirus 71 has been associated with a few cases of severe neurological disease, and a protective vaccine is under development. It is a little surprising that the Hong Kong Department of Health does not keep more detailed records. - Mod.CP
