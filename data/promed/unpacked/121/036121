Health officials investigate listeriosis cases
----------------------------------------------
State health officials are investigating several cases of food-borne
illness called listeriosis.
All 5 cases have occurred in the Richmond area in the past 6 weeks [June to
mid July 2004]. Health department officials say it's unusual to have a
cluster of 5 cases in this short period of time.
Listeriosis is caused by the bacterium _Listeria monocytogenes_. Unwashed
produce, raw meat, soft cheese, and cold cuts can carry the germs. It can
cause mild symptoms that include nausea or diarrhea, but, if it enters the
bloodstream, or nervous system, it can cause a severe illness such as
meningitis. People with compromised immune systems [particularly those with
defects in cellular immunity, and pregnant women - Mod. LL] are
particularly vulnerable to the disease.

[Typing of the organisms can tell if they are identical. If so, a food
source, such as cold cuts, needs to be sought to minimize additional cases
that could be spread over a larger area. - Mod.LL]
