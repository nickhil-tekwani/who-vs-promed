Cheeses produced by a Benton Harbor cheese producer have been linked to an outbreak of listeriosis that has sickened 6 people in 6 states since 2017, according to an alert issued jointly Friday [30 Sep 2022] by the federal Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The agencies issued a food safety alert after cases in Michigan, California, Georgia, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Texas involving brie and camembert cheese made by Old Europe Cheese Inc., of Benton Harbor. The company issued a voluntary recall for its brie and camembert cheeses on Friday [30 Sep 2022].

The federal alert urged consumers who have purchased brie and camembert from Old Europe not to eat them, and to dispose of them or return them to the place where they were purchased.

Listeriosis is a serious infection usually caused by eating food contaminated with the bacterium _Listeria monocytogenes_, according to the CDC. Most people who become infected are hospitalized. The current outbreak resulted in 5 hospitalizations but no deaths.

The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development [MDARD] was contracted to assist the federal agencies' investigation, said Jennifer Holton, spokeswoman for the state agency.

Asked why the alert was issued now when cases stretched back to 2017, a CDC spokesperson said the cases were only recently linked to the Old Europe plant. The spokesperson noted _Listeria_ is a hardy bacterium that can survive for years on surfaces that aren't properly cleaned.

State investigators interviewed 5 of the 6 people who were infected, including 4 who were hospitalized. Based on results of the interviews, combined with laboratory data, MDARD concluded the infections were linked to the Benton Harbor facility.

The Old Europe plant was inspected by investigators with the FDA and the Michigan Department of Agriculture; the same strain of _Listeria_ identified in the outbreak was found in a sample collected from the floor in a cooling room, the press release said.

Brie and camembert cheeses produced by Old Europe are sold under multiple brand names, and a list is available on the CDC website. The products are sold at many grocery chains nationwide, including Albertson's, Giant Foods, Lidl, Stop & Shop, Whole Foods and others.

People who purchased the recalled cheese should throw it away and clean their refrigerator as well as any surfaces the cheese has come into contact with, officials said.

Consumers should contact their physician if they experience symptoms of listeriosis, including headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance or confusion in addition to fever and muscle aches.

People who are pregnant usually experience only fever, fatigue and muscle aches, but officials caution _Listeria_ can cause pregnancy loss or premature birth as well as serious illness or even deaths in newborns.

Investigators are working to determine if additional products may be contaminated.

Investigation Details [https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/outbreaks/monocytogenes-09-22/details.html]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are collecting different types of data to investigate a multistate outbreak of _Listeria monocytogenes_ infections.

Epidemiologic, traceback, and laboratory data show that cheese made by Old Europe Cheese, Inc. may be contaminated with _Listeria_ and may be making people sick.

Epidemiologic and Traceback Data
--------------------------------
As of 28 Sep 2022, 6 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Listeria_ have been reported from 6 states (see map). Sick people's samples were collected from 6 Aug 2017 to 5 Aug 2022 (see timeline [https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/outbreaks/monocytogenes-09-22/epi.html]).

Sick people range in age from 56 to 83 years, with a median age of 78, and 67% are female. Five people have been hospitalized, and no deaths have been reported.

The true number of sick people in this outbreak is likely higher than the number reported, and the outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses. This is because some people recover without medical care and are not tested for _Listeria_. In addition, recent illnesses may not yet be reported as it usually takes 3 to 4 weeks to determine if a sick person is part of an outbreak.

State and local public health officials are interviewing people about the foods they ate in the month before they got sick. Of the 5 people interviewed, 4 (80%) reported eating brie or camembert cheese. Most people did not remember the brand of the cheese they ate, but one person reported eating Lidl Premium Brand Brie. Old Europe Cheese is the only manufacturer of Lidl Premium Brand Brie.

Laboratory Data
---------------
Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. CDC PulseNet manages a national database of DNA fingerprints of bacteria that cause foodborne illnesses. DNA fingerprinting is performed on bacteria using a method called whole genome sequencing (WGS).

WGS showed that bacteria from sick people's samples are closely related genetically. This suggests that people in this outbreak got sick from the same food.

FDA, with assistance from the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, inspected the Old Europe Cheese facility in Michigan and collected samples for testing. WGS showed that the _Listeria_ found in the cooling room is closely related genetically to _Listeria_ from sick people's samples. This provides more evidence that people likely got sick from eating cheese made by Old Europe Cheese.

Public Health Actions
---------------------
On 30 Sep 2022, Old Europe Cheese, Inc. recalled their brie and camembert cheese. The company has also temporarily stopped producing these cheeses.

CDC is advising people not to eat, sell, or serve recalled cheese.

The FDA, along with CDC and state and local partners, is investigating a multistate outbreak of _Listeria monocytogenes_ infections linked to Brie and Camembert soft cheese products manufactured by Old Europe Cheese, Inc. of Benton Harbor, MI, and sold at various retailers under multiple labels and brands, including Reny Picot.

Based on epidemiologic information provided by CDC, of the 5 patients with information available, 4 (80%) report eating Brie or Camembert cheese prior to illness. FDA, with assistance from the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, initiated an inspection at the Old Europe Cheese, Inc. facility in Michigan, which included sample collection and analysis. Analysis of environmental samples collected at the facility showed the presence of _Listeria monocytogenes_.

Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) analysis determined that the _Listeria_ strain found in the facility matches the _Listeria_ strain causing illnesses in this outbreak.

Old Europe Cheese, Inc. has voluntarily recalled multiple brands of Brie and Camembert cheeses produced at their Michigan facility in response to investigation findings. The firm has also halted production and distribution of their Brie and Camembert products from the Michigan facility and is working with FDA on corrective actions. Consumers, restaurants, and retailers should not eat, sell, or serve recalled products and should throw them away; this includes Best By Dates ranging from 28 Sep 2022 to 14 Dec 2022, and all flavors and quantities. A full list of recalled products and stores that potentially sold these products is available below and on the firm's recall [https://www.fda.gov/food/outbreaks-foodborne-illness/outbreak-investigation-listeria-monocytogenes-brie-and-camembert-soft-cheese-products-september-2022#Recalled].

FDA's investigation is ongoing to determine if additional products are potentially contaminated. Updates to this advisory will be provided as they become available.

[A common source is presumed for a cluster of cases of listeriosis if the clinical isolates of _Listeria_ have the same genotype based on Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS). A food item is suspected based on interviewing the affected people about the foods they ate in the month before they got sick. Of the 5 people interviewed in the current outbreak, 4 (80%) reported eating brie or camembert cheese. The food item is confirmed to be the source if the genotype of _Listeria_ isolated from that food matches that of the clinical outbreak strain. Although pasteurization of milk kills _Listeria_, soft cheeses made from pasteurized milk can still become contaminated if they are produced in facilities with unsanitary conditions. In this case, WGS analysis determined that the _Listeria_ strain found in the cheese manufacturing facility matched the outbreak _Listeria_ strain causing illnesses.

The _Listeria_-contaminated brie and camembert cheeses that are produced by Old Europe and sold under multiple brand names at many grocery chains nationwide has been recalled and the production and distribution facility in Michigan has been closed. - Mod.ML
