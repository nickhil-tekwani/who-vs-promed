Ecology of Eastern Equine Encephalitis in New Jersey
----------------------------------------------------
In 1959 New Jersey had eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), and of 33 cases
there were 22 deaths. The sequelae of EEE ranged from moderate to serious,
with one woman dying within a year of acquiring the disease.
In New Jersey, EEE in humans generally occurs at the interface of the salt
marsh and cedar swamps, the home of _Culiseta melanura_, the mosquito that
cycles the disease in the avian population and rarely feeds on humans. The
bridge vector bringing the diseases to humans is _Ochlerotatus
sollicitans_, the saltmarsh mosquito, which has an extended flight
range. By virtue of feeding nocturnally on birds in nearby roosting areas,
control of _Cs. melanura_ is complicated by the fact that it is a cryptic
breeder in areas where larviciding is virtually impossible and adulticiding
contraindicated.
Research conducted by Rutgers University has tracked the pattern of
mosquito-cycled disease in the roosting areas to the acquiring of the
diseases in daytime feeding areas on the salt marsh by _Oc. sollicitans_.
EEE control must of necessity be achieved by controlling the bridge vector
through water management strategies, through larviciding and ultimately,
when natural events (storm tides or heavy runoff from heavy upland
rainfall) prevent or override the first 2, through adulticiding, both
ground and aerial. EEE is a disease no one in New Jersey takes lightly,
both because of its effects on humans and because of the economic impact on
the casino and resort industries.
