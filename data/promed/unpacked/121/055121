Ebola Strikes More Nurses
----------------------------------
A 33-year-old man from Kyenjojo district, who had been admitted at
Virika Hospital in Fort Portal with suspected Ebola, died yesterday
afternoon [3 Dec 2007]. If confirmed, his demise would bring to 17
the number of people who have died since the outbreak of the epidemic
in August [2007]. The team that visited Bundibugyo Hospital yesterday
also learnt that 4 more medical workers were suspected to be
infected. They were among the 9 patients treated at one of the 2
isolation units in the hospital. All of them were health workers,
including the matron and a nursing assistant of the UPDF [Uganda
People's Defence Force].

The unit, formerly an anti-natal ward, seen by a New Vision team, was
poorly equipped and understaffed. There was only one male nurse, who
was wearing gloves and a mask, but no protective over-all. The doors
were not locked and there was no sign that this was an isolation
ward. About 5 attendants walked in and out, some were wearing either
gloves or masks, while others were not protected at all. One
attendant, dressed in white, was touching a patient with her bare
hands, as if she was not aware of the danger. No doctors were seen at
the hospital. The superintendent was still admitted in a private wing
of the hospital. His condition was said to have improved.

Though foreign experts were reported to have come in to help with the
treatment, none were seen by The New Vision team at Bundibugyo
Hospital. Contrary to findings by The New Vision, the Ministry of
Health said only 6 new cases of Ebola had been reported over the last
week, including one health worker. "All the other 6 health care
workers who had been put under quarantine because of Ebola-related
complaints are still under observation," said a statement by Dr. Sam
Zaramba, the Director General of Health Services.

According to Zaramba, experts from the World Health Organisation,
Medecins sans Frontieres and the Centres for Disease Control had
arrived in the country to help with laboratory diagnosis, case
research and management. A permanent laboratory will be set up this
week at the Uganda Virus Research Institute Entebbe to speed up the
diagnosis of Ebola and other viral haemorrhagic fevers, while
equipment for the laboratory is expected to arrive today [4 Dec
2007], the statement added. Currently, samples have to be taken to
South Africa or the Centres for Disease Control in Atlanta, USA.

Meanwhile, the UPDF has deployed a team of medical officers and
health educators to Bundibugyo. They will assist in the management of
Ebola patients and sensitising the public. UPDF 2nd Division
spokesperson, Lt. Tabaro Kiconco, said more personnel from the UPDF
Medical Department would be deployed in Bundibugyo today, while
emergency supplies would be delivered to Kabarole.

No new cases have been reported in Kabarole. So far, 2 patients with
Ebola symptoms have been admitted in Buhinga Hospital in Fort-Portal,
of which one died.

Following the Ebola outbreak, the 5 districts of the Rwenzori region
have postponed their joint education week celebrations, which were
slated to start today in Kasese. Other reports from Bundibugyo say
elders have resorted to consulting their oracles and sacrificing to
their ancestors to appease the gods.

is still awaited. - Mod.CP]
