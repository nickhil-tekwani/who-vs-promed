Commission submits French research findings on TSE in a goat to expert panel
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Following the findings by a research group in France that they suspect the
presence of a TSE [transmissible spongiform encephalopathy] infection in a
goat's brain which tests cannot distinguish from BSE, the European Commission
has submitted data received from the French authorities to the Community
Reference Laboratory (CRL) for TSEs based in Weybridge, England, for an
evaluation by an expert panel.
TSEs are transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, namely BSE affecting
cattle, and scrapie affecting goats and sheep. The expert panel will
evaluate, over the next 2 weeks or so, the scientific evidence to see whether
it indicates the presence of BSE in the goat. This isolated incident does not
present a risk to public health, as the goat and its herd did not enter the
food or feed chain.
BSE has never been found under natural circumstances in ruminants other than
cattle. Its presence in goats or other ruminants has been viewed as
theoretically possible but has never been detected. Nevertheless, for many
years safety measures have been applied in respect of all farmed ruminants
(cattle, goats, sheep) to offer maximum public health protection. These
safety measures include the prohibition on feeding animal proteins in the
form of meat-and-bone meal [MBM], the removal of specified risk materials
(i.e., the removal of tissues such as brain, spinal cord, part of the
intestines) from the food and feed chain, the slaughtering of herds affected
by scrapie (a disease of goats and sheep similar to BSE but not infectious
for humans), and a TSE surveillance/monitoring programme in all Member States.
This goat was detected as part of the EU wide surveillance programme designed
to detect suspicious TSE strains in small ruminants. Over 140 000 goats have
been tested since April 2002.
Arising from this EU testing programme, a healthy goat slaughtered in 2002 in
France was tested at random for TSEs. Based on the initial positive finding
of a TSE which differed from the normal scrapie strains, further scientific
study has been carried out on the suspect brain (the necessary assays take 2
years) leading to the conclusion by French experts that they believe the
brain could be BSE-positive. If confirmed, this would be the 1st ever such
finding in a goat. This goat was the only animal in the flock affected. All
goats in the flock, including the affected one, were destroyed, and tests on
all 300 adults in the flock were negative for all TSEs. Thus, arising from
the application of EU law, no product from this herd reached the human/animal
food chain, thereby avoiding any risk to public health.
An expert panel co-ordinated by the Community Reference Laboratory (CRL) for
TSEs in Weybridge will now examine the data from the research project and
will advise the Commission on the significance of the findings and the need
for any further work.
The Commission is also sending the French research data to the European Food
Safety Authority (EFSA) for its consideration. Once the CRL experts report,
this will also be sent to EFSA. Based on the outcome of the CRL analysis, the
Commission will ask EFSA for any necessary updates in its scientific risk
assessment in respect of goats.
Pending receipt of the CRL's expert opinion and any follow-up EFSA opinion,
the Commission is not immediately proposing any further risk management
measures beyond the extensive legislation already in force.
The Commission, as well as keeping in close contact with the French
authorities, is keeping the medical and veterinary authorities of the Member
States updated.

[As stated in the EU press release, this isolated incident does not present
even a theoretical risk to public health, since the entire herd has been
destroyed. However, in view of the fact that the case involved a healthy
slaughtered goat, tested at random for TSE, the possible introduction of
other goats with similar TSE changes into the food chain cannot be excluded.
In case the BSE etiology is confirmed, it will be of significant importance
to know which organs of infected goats contain the agent, and specifically
whether it affects muscles and the placenta. If the latter is affected (as
the case is in scrapie), this may indicate a possibility of horizontal BSE
transmission.
Results of the further studies are anticipated with interest. - Mod.AS]
[This epidemiologist would like to know more, for example the goat's age, and
was it ever fed MBM, or milk substitute containing animal fat, or kept in the
same field or shed with cattle, or previously used by cattle. - Mod.JW]
