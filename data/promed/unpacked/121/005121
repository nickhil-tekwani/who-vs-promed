Disease threatens cucumbers, pumpkins, and other vine crops
-----------------------------------------------------------
US plant pathologists are reporting a significant increase in the
occurrence of Phytophthora blight [Pb] of vine crops, including cucumbers,
pumpkins, and squash, in many vegetable-growing regions of the United
States. This devastating disease, caused by the soilborne fungus
_Phytophthora capsici_ [Pc], often results in nearly total yield loss.
According to Mohammad Babadoost, a plant pathology professor at the
University of Illinois, Pb has become one of the most serious threats to
production of vine crops, or cucurbits, in the US and worldwide. Recent
outbreaks of Pb have threatened pumpkin and other cucurbit industries
especially in Illinois, which produces about 90 per cent of processing
pumpkins grown in the US. According to Babadoost, heavy crop losses often
force growers to abandon their own farms, and move into different areas,
sometimes traveling more than 50 miles, to find fields free of Pc.
Pb can strike cucurbit plants at any stage of growth. Infection usually
appears first in low areas of fields where the soil remains wet for longer
periods of time. The pathogen infects seedlings, vines, leaves, and fruit.
The disease is usually associated with heavy rainfall, excessive
irrigation, or poorly drained soil. Frequent irrigation increases disease
incidence.
Currently, there are no cucurbit cultivars with measurable resistance to
Pb. Plant pathologists are working to find new methods of controlling the
disease. Babadoost says that in addition to exploring cultural management
strategies, plant pathologists are assessing the possibilities of
biocontrol agents, fungicides for control of the pathogen in cucurbits and
other crops as well as using induced resistance in plants.

[A comment is required regarding the phenomenon of induced resistance in
plants. For example, lower leaves of a plant, when inoculated with a
necrotizing pathogen, will express typical symptoms in leaves of
susceptible plants. At a later time (a few days) when newly developed upper
leaves are inoculated with the same or a related pathogen, fewer lesions
and/or reduced lesion size are observed, relative to control plants not
previously inoculated. This phenomenon is described as systemic acquired
resistance (SAR), and the inducing agent is considered to be salicylic acid
[SA]. SAR is associated with systemic expression of pathogenesis-related
proteins (PR proteins) in infected plants. Moreover, application of
exogenous SA induces both PR proteins and resistance to attack by pathogens.
SAR is a hot topic in plant pathology and plant molecular biology, and I
have provided a number of references for those who wish to delve further.
