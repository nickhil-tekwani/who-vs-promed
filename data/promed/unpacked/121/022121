A 9-year-old child from Tonosi was positive for [a] hantavirus [infection] in Los Santos province.

Carlos Munoz, Regional Los Santos Epidemiology Coordinator, stated that this is the 1st case in a child so far in 2018.

Last year [2017] there was also another case in a child in August 2017.

Munoz said that the children who suffer hantavirus infections are not complicated cases and generally maintain only fever from this disease [and do not progress to hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome - Mod.TY].

[Although this is the 1st hantavirus infection case in a child in Los Santos province this year (2018), the number of cases of hantavirus infection continues to increase in the province this year (2018). Hantavirus infections occur in Los Santos province relatively frequently. Fortunately, this case apparently is progressing favorably without development of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome. The specific situation in which this patient acquired the infection is not mentioned. There is no indication of which hantavirus is involved in this or in previous cases in Panama.

As noted in comments in previous posts, Los Santos and adjoining provinces are endemic for Choclo hantavirus. Although no data on this or the previous cases in earlier years include an indication of which hantavirus is responsible, Choclo is the only one of the 3 hantaviruses known to be endemic in Panama that causes HPS (hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome) or hantavirus fever. No vaccine is available for Choclo virus.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents occur in and around agricultural areas and adjacent houses and buildings. They can be persistently infected with the virus and shed it in urine, feces, and saliva. - Mod.TY
