Lassa fever has killed one in person in Rivers state. Rivers State Commissioner for Health Dr. Sampson Parker, who disclosed this to a journalist in Port Harcourt, said the deceased died at the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital before help could come his way. He said: "Just a few days ago, my attention was drawn to the isolation of the virus in a suspected case, and we lost the patient before any spirited attempt could be made to rescue him."

The commissioner said the state government has risen to the challenges of the Lassa fever outbreak by intensifying surveillance and consolidating the established control structures. He said an isolation ward has been designated and equipped "for this purpose at the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital, and a multi-disciplinary task force has already fashioned an integrated approach to ensure that the disease is contained." He said the state government has procured sufficient drugs and consumables to manage exposed persons and called on the people to maintain the best hygiene and cleanliness as well as to keep rodents out of their houses and working places.

Last year [2012], the state recorded an outbreak of Lassa fever which claimed many lives.

[Lassa fever continues to cause problems in Nigeria. The most recent report described extensive outbreaks in central and northern Nigeria (see: Lassa fever - Nigeria (08) 20130314.1585). The current report describes a fatal case in Rivers state, which is located in the extreme south of Nigeria.

The reservoir host of Lassa virus is the rodent known as the "multimammate rat" belonging to the genus _ Mastomys_. These rodents produce large numbers of offspring and are numerous in the savannas and forests of west, central, and east Africa. Most relevant is their habit to readily colonize human homes. The _Mastomys_ spp. rodents shed the virus in their urine and faeces. Therefore, the virus can be transmitted through direct contact with these materials, through touching or eating food contaminated with these materials, or through cuts or sores. Because _Mastomys_ rodents often live in and around homes and scavenge human food remains or poorly stored food, transmission by this means is common. Contact with the virus also may occur when a person inhales tiny particles in the air contaminated with rodent excrement. Therefore, control of human infection will require general improvement of living conditions and rodent control rather than reliance on deployment of medical care and a vaccine which does not yet exist.
