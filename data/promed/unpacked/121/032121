[ProMED-mail would like to know that too. Do our subscribers in Bangladesh
have any such details? - Mod.JW

There must be more to this than I understand. I was under the impression
that arsenic tolerances could be built up by repeated (and, possibly,
increased) doses of the chemical. I believe this technique has found its
way into several fictional murder cases as well as some not so fictitious.
If these were local folks consuming contaminated well water why is it that
they just didn't build up their tolerance levels--or is there a tolerance
maximum? Alternatively, those poisoned may have been "just passing through."

[In spite of the dubious nature of Bernie's address, he's right. Remember
Napoleon on the Isle of Elba? One supposes that the doses being received
by the Bangladesh cases are well in excess of subclinical. More details
from the country are sorely needed - Mod.JW

Without wishing to diminish the horror brought about by continual exposure
to arsenic in drinking water reported for parts of Bangladesh, the claim
that it is possibly the largest mass poisoning case in the world today
neglects to consider the case of tobacco products which, directly and
indirectly, cause slow but predictable poisoning of massive numbers of
people.
