[The definition of the designations deaths, definite cases, probable
vCJD cases, and the case definitions can be found by accessing the
Department of Health website or by reference to a previous
ProMED-mail post in this thread (for example, CJD (new var.) - UK:
update March 2002 20020305.3693).
Data on vCJD cases from other parts of the world are now included in
these updates whenever available.
Also, data on other forms of CJD (sporadic, iatrogenic, familial and

Monthly Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease Statistics - As of Mon 6 Mar 2006
-----------------------------------------------
The Department of Health is today [Mon 6 Mar 2006] issuing the latest
information about the numbers of known cases of Creutzfeldt Jakob
disease. This includes cases of variant Creutzfeldt Jakob disease
[abbreviated in ProMED-mail as CJD (new var.) or vCJD], the form of
the disease thought to be linked to BSE (bovine spongiform
encephalopathy).
Definite and probable CJD cases in the UK, as of Mon 6 Mar 2006:
Summary of vCJD Cases - Deaths
-----------------------------
Deaths from definite vCJD (confirmed): 110
Deaths from probable vCJD (without neuropathological confirmation): 44
Deaths from probable vCJD (neuropathological confirmation pending): 0
Number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD (as above): 154

Summary of vCJD Cases - Alive
-----------------------------
Number of probable vCJD cases still alive: 6
Total
-----
Number of definite or probable vCJD (dead and alive): 160
(The next table will be published on Mon 3 Apr 2006).
[Since the previous monthly statistics were released on Mon 6 Feb
2006, the total number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD
remains unchanged, but the overall total has increased from 159 to
160 by inclusion of an additional patient who remains alive.
Consequently, the overall total number of definite or probable vCJD
cases (dead and alive) has increased from 159 to 150.
These data are consistent with the view that the vCJD outbreak in the
UK is now in decline (see following report). The number of deaths due
to definite or probable vCJD in the UK during the 12 months of 2005
remains 5. The peak number of deaths was 28 in the year 2000,
followed by 20 in 2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in 2003, and 9 in 2004, 5 in
2005, and so far one in 2006. - Mod.CP]
Totals for All Types of CJD Cases in the UK during 2005
-----------------------------------------------
As of 6 Mar 2006, in the UK in the year 2005, there were 121
referrals of suspected CJD, and there were 62 deaths from sporadic
CJD, 6 from familial CJD, 3 from iatrogenic CJD, 4 GSS
(Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker) syndrome cases, and 5 deaths from
vCJD. The corresponding figures so far for the 1st 2 months of 2006
are: 11 referrals, 8 deaths from sporadic CJD, one from familial CJD,
one from vCJD, and none from iatrogenic CJD nor GSS.

[2] UK Strategy for Research and Development on Human and Animal
Health Aspects of TSEs 2005-2008

UK Strategy for Research and Development on Human and Animal Health
Aspects of Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSEs) 2005-2008
-----------------------------------------------
The attention of ProMED-mail readers is drawn to a document released
by the UK Medical Research Council concerning the UK strategy for
research into human and animal aspects of TSEs, the Preface of which
is reproduced below. This document, which is too long to reproduce
here, provides a coherent account of the current state of research
and future priorities up to 2008. The document is supplemented by a
bibliography of 333 key papers in the field and an appendix listing
useful websites.
The preface
-----------
Since the announcement in 1996 of a possible link between BSE in
cattle and vCJD in humans, 2 strategy documents for research and
development into transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs)
have been produced by the UK government. TSE research has advanced
significantly during the past few years, and as senior
representatives of the UK public funders of TSE research, we
considered it timely to review the current understanding of these
diseases and set out a new research strategy that reflected the
changes in knowledge.
This document represents the 1st UK joint human and animal health
strategy for TSE research and addresses issues that affect livestock,
the food chain and public health. It highlights the improved
coordination that has taken place between government departments
since the publication of the Phillips Report and reflects the
overlapping issues of relevance to both human and animal health.
In the production of this document, we have drawn on a wide range of
advice from all of the UK's major funders of TSE research and from
members of specialist advisory committees such as SEAC, which are
detailed within. We have also undertaken wide consultation in the UK
and overseas in an attempt to ensure the accuracy of the information
included. We are particularly indebted to Professor Chris Bostock
(formerly director of the Institute for Animal Health) for his 2004
review of the science, which forms the backbone of this document.
With numbers of BSE cases continuing to fall and vCJD cases
apparently stabilizing in the UK, it would be easy to be complacent.
However, the increasing incidence of chronic wasting disease in the
USA reinforces the concern that TSEs are an international problem and
one that will need to be monitored carefully for a number of years.
In the UK, there remain key issues that continue to pose threats to
animal and human health. Not least is the possibility of a
non-symptomatic carrier state or the emergence of BSE-like illness in
another species such as sheep.
While every attempt is made to reduce exposure to disease, it is not
always possible to eradicate it completely. Disease management is
thus often based on risk assessments of potential exposure, and these
are based on the latest scientific results.
This document aims to highlight the major scientific uncertainties
relating to TSEs and how these will be addressed by the research and
development strategies of the major UK funders. The necessary
experience of managing BSE and producing scientific evidence upon
which to base control policies has led to the development of an
extensive UK research base in human and animal health aspects of TSEs.
The UK has a special responsibility to share its expertise in TSEs
with Europe and the rest of the world to minimize the effects of TSE
infection in other countries.
Although considerable progress has been made, further studies are
required to fill in the many gaps in our basic understanding of TSEs
and in our knowledge of how TSE epidemics can be effectively
controlled. It is therefore vital that the UK research base is
maintained and that a coordinated and effective funding strategy is
adopted for new research. Science develops, and inevitably, this
strategy will require regular reassessment.
