2 exposed to rabid bat in Utica, New York
-----------------------------------------
Two people are receiving post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) treatment for
rabies after possible exposure in their Utica home to a bat that tested
positive for rabies.

"It was fortunate that the animal was captured and brought in for testing
since these people have possibly been exposed to a deadly disease," Bobbi
Jo Girven, coordinator for the Rabies Treatment and Prevention Program at
Oneida County Health Department, said. "They did precisely what one should
do if they find a bat in their home and there has been possible exposure."

Girven said that while only a small percentage of bats carry the deadly
virus, people cannot risk contracting rabies if they have contact with the
animal or awaken to find a bat in their bedroom, a child's room or anywhere
an intoxicated or otherwise incapacitated person might be.

In such instances, people are urged to not let the bat escape. The proper
method of safely capturing the animal can be found on the health
department's website at <http://www.ocgov.net>. The recent finding of the
diseased bat shows that rabies is still active in the county and people
should take the proper precautions, including having their pets vaccinated
and keeping them current on their rabies shots, Girven said. State law
requires that all dogs, cats and ferrets, at least 3 months of age, be
vaccinated for rabies.

Yankton pet owners cautioned about rabies
-----------------------------------------
Yankton's animal control officer is reminding pet owners to make sure their
animals are vaccinated for rabies after a bat recently tested positive for
the viral disease.

Lisa Brasel tells the Yankton Press and Dakotan that it's been a long time
since there has been a bat with rabies in the city. Brasel says the
infected bat bit a person at the veterinary clinic where it was tested, but
that person had been vaccinated and required only a booster shot.

The South Dakota Department of Health says 53 animals tested positive for
rabies last year across the state. Most were skunks.

Animal control officer Carol J Gaucher is warning residents that there are
rabid animals in the West Avenue-Thompson Pond area of Spencer. A rabid
raccoon was found by a homeowner in that area on 23 Sep 2010. The raccoon
had entered the home through a broken window in the cellar. The homeowner's
dog killed the raccoon.

The 10 year old dog was not current on its rabies shots and is under 6
months' quarantine, Mrs Gaucher said yesterday [1 Oct 2010]. The owner had
to get a booster, and her boyfriend had to get a series of shots, according
to the animal control officer.

[The article is interesting in that there is no mention of why the owner
had to have a booster. This may indicate that the person was previously
vaccinated against rabies and may be animal control worker, a veterinarian
or some other person in a high risk situation. Certainly the other person
had to have the full series of post exposure prophylaxis. - Mod.TG]

San Benito Co. skunks test positive for rabies
----------------------------------------------
Hollister Animal Control is investigating 2 cases of rabies after skunks
were found in San Benito County infected with the disease.

The 2 skunks were seized on Thursday [30 Sep 2010] near unincorporated San
Juan Bautista. At about 0900, officers with the Hollister Police Department
Animal Control were sent to Bello Drive after a report of a sick or injured
skunk. Officers located the skunk, which tested positive for rabies, and
euthanized it.

At about 1115 the same day, officers were sent to Mission Vineyard Road in
San Juan Bautista after it was reported that a skunk had attacked 2 dogs
and a homeowner. The homeowner killed the skunk in self-defense, police said.

Animal control officers took the skunk, which also tested positive for
rabies. Police are advising pet owners to vaccinate their pets, including
dogs and cats, against rabies.

Another confirmed rabies case in Lassen County
----------------------------------------------
If you haven't done so, today is a good day to make an appointment to get
your pets their rabies vaccine. That includes your cats and horses. [Great
advice. - Mod.TG]

A bat that was found clinging to the tail of a horse tested positive for
rabies. It was brought into the Lassen County Environmental Health
Department and then sent to a Shasta County lab.

Public health officials caution residents to stay clear of wild animals,
even dead ones, and to make sure all pets are vaccinated against rabies.
This includes cats as well as dogs, since more cats than dogs were reported
rabid in recent years. That goes for cats that are considered indoor pets
since an occasional bat can get into a home.

Vaccination is the best way to prevent your family and your pets from
contracting the disease. Rabies is endemic to Northern California, and it
is a disease that can affect all mammals. It's particularly common in bat
populations in Lassen County and is occasionally found in other wild
animals. Residents are urged to avoid any direct contact with wild animals
-- especially bats, skunks, raccoons and foxes. The disease is usually
passed on to humans by domestic animals that contract it from wild animals.

[I have included this article in the update because it highlights ways that
our large animals can become exposed. There is no mention in this article
or in searches regarding if the horse was vaccinated against rabies. There
is no mention of if the horse was put into quarantine or if the owners were
instructed to watch for clinical signs of rabies. Further, one wonders if
any education was provided as to what to watch for and what to do if they
suspect their horse has contracted rabies? Also are there other horses?
Could the bat have bitten more than one and only become entangled in the
tail of one? - Mod.TG]

Officials urge caution after rabid kitten found in Cobb
-------------------------------------------------------
A recent rabid kitten bite in Marietta has raised the concerns of Douglas
County health officials about the spread of rabies.

A family took in the kitten about 2 months ago and it became ill and bit a
child. The rabies test came back positive. The child and other members of
the family are now undergoing medical treatment. Animal control officers
last week were combing the area near Whitlock Avenue and McDonald Street in
Marietta, searching for other stray cats.

"We've had no rabies cases reported in Douglas County this year or last
year," said Darlene Foote, spokesperson for Cobb and Douglas Public Health.
"However, we're encouraging people to take precautions and avoid contact
with stray animals that could carry the disease."

Information on animal testing is available by calling Douglas County Animal
Control. Information on rabies prevention is available online at

Rabid bat found at Cleveland [Texas] football stadium
-----------------------------------------------------
A bat with rabies has been found at the Indian Stadium. The bat was first
discovered during the Cleveland Middle School football game on Thu 30 Sep
2010, and was captured by the City of Cleveland animal control officer. The
City of Cleveland received the results confirming that the bat had tested
positive for rabies on 4 Oct 2010.

A letter to notify all parents was sent home Mon 4 Oct 2010. The district
is asking all parents to speak to their children, and if your child handled
or was bitten by a bat, please immediately see a doctor or contact the
Texas Department of Health. School officials are also stressing the
importance for adults to instruct children to never touch or attempt to
catch a bat.

The district is currently working with a company to determine if a bat
colony exists and where it may be located. The district also has taken
precautionary measures to fill in holes and cracks where bats could
possibly live. If needed, further action will be taken to ensure the safety
of all students and community members at our district events.

[While many high school football stadiums are open air, the issue of a
rabid bat at such a gathering of teenagers and other children presents a
concern. It would be nice if the Department of State Health Services [the
official name for the Texas Department of Health] would post a follow up on
what the findings are regarding how many people may have been exposed. -

Health Department: Bat bites can cause rabies
---------------------------------------------
The Orange County Health Department issued an alert Friday [8 Oct 2010]
warning residents to avoid contact with bats because of a risk of being
exposed to rabies. The department learned that recently "several residents"
were "exposed to bats in their homes."

Reports that Orange County Animal Services recently removed 7 fruit bats
from an Orlando woman's apartment near the MetroWest area prompted the warning.

Spokeswoman Mirna Chamorro said that so far, only 1 confirmed report of a
bat bite has been filed this year with the department, but she cautions
that bite marks from the flying mammals can be very small and not easily
recognized.

"If you wake up because a bat landed on you while you were sleeping, or if
you awakened and found a bat in your room, you should seek medical
attention immediately and contact your local animal-control agency," the
Health Department warns. [Many people reportedly do not awaken, even when
bitten. - Mod.TG]

[11] Raccoon, human exposure - Georgia

A confirmed rabies case in Byron [Georgia] has some neighbors concerned. A
man who came into direct contact with the animal is spreading awareness in
his community.

"The raccoon jumped out of the flower bed and got a hold of my blue jeans
and then the dog came in and grabbed it and [I] pulled the dog back. I got
saliva on my hands and I had cuts on my hands so I contacted the DNR
[Department of Natural Resources]," says the Byron Man who was
[potentially] infected with rabies. "They took the animal and sent it to
Albany and it came back positive for rabies so then I started the rabies
shots," [Post Exposure Prophylaxis] he added.

Though this man is on his way to a safe recovery, he says he's concerned
for his neighbors and kids in the area. "The actual exposure was on 15 Sep
2010. The results came back as rabies on 17 Sep 2010 and here we are 3
weeks later and the public hasn't been notified that there is a confirmed
case of rabies in a raccoon environment. I'm concerned about those who are
getting on and off the school bus in the area. Right now there are 3 dead
raccoons on the side of the road and I'm worried about the public," he says.

Since his 1st encounter with the rabid raccoon 3 others have appeared on
the side of the road, just too much of a coincidence for him to ignore.

"This animal came at me unprovoked I didn't even know it was there. If
you're exposed to the saliva then you have the potential to acquire rabies
and if you don't get the vaccination and the symptoms sink in it can be
fatal," he added. The Peach County Health Department has been notified
about this case and asks the public to get in touch with them if they come
in contact with a wild animal.

[It seems unlikely that the Health Department or Animal Control would not
have issued some form of alert. Possibly the self-proclaimed public
educator just missed it?

In each of the rabies updates I continually note the wide variety of
locations, from country to urban settings and all across the US. Rabies
does not respect weather or tourist locations or size of animal. We would
all do well to remember to vaccinate our pets, large and small and to keep
a watchful out for the unexpected. - Mod.TG]
