The West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources (DHHR), Bureau for Public Health, in coordination with local health partners, has confirmed the state's 1st case of salmonellosis in an infant as a result of ingesting recalled powdered infant formula.

Last week, the FDA and CDC announced they were investigating 4 complaints of infant illness related to products produced at Abbott Nutrition's facility located in Sturgis, MI, received from 6 Sep 2021 to 18 Dec 2021. Complaints included 3 reports of _Cronobacter sakazakii_ infections and one report of _Salmonella [enterica_] Newport infection in infants. All infants were hospitalized, and there was one death.

Abbott issued a voluntary recall of powdered infant formula from Similac, Alimentum, or EleCare with the following product codes, which can be found on the container: the 1st 2 digits of the code are 22 through 37, and the code contains K8, SH, or Z2, and the expiration date is 1 Apr 2022 (APR 2022) or later. These products are widely distributed across the USA and other countries. Formulas matching the codes provided above could be contaminated with _Cronobacter_. These bacteria can cause severe foodborne illness in infants with newborns being especially high risk.

"Parents and caregivers with infants on formula should immediately review the formula to ensure they are not using a recalled product," said Dr. Ayne Amjad, state health officer and commissioner of DHHR's Bureau for Public Health. "They should seek immediate medical care if their infant has consumed recalled formula and is experiencing signs and symptoms of _Cronobacter_ or _Salmonella_ infection: diarrhea, poor feeding, irritability, vomiting, or blood in their stool."

Parents and caregivers with a sick infant who has consumed a recalled product are encouraged to keep opened or unopened cans of recalled formula in the instance that the local health department would like to sample the product.

_Cronobacter_ bacteria can cause severe, life-threatening infections such as sepsis or meningitis. Symptoms of sepsis and meningitis include poor feeding, irritability, temperature changes, jaundice, grunting breaths, and abnormal movements. _Cronobacter_ infection may also cause bowel damage and may spread through the blood to other parts of the body. Parents or caregivers noticing any of these symptoms in their children should seek immediate medical care.

Products that do not contain the information listed above are not impacted by this advisory. This advisory does not include liquid formula products or any metabolic deficiency nutrition formulas.

Healthcare providers and health departments are encouraged to report any confirmed cases of _Cronobacter_ or _Salmonella_ who consumed a recalled product to the DHHR's Office of Epidemiological and Preventive Services at 304-558-5358, extension 2.

Families who purchase infant formula with WIC benefits should reach out to their WIC clinic to return any open or unopened recalled products. WIC clinics must verify the products prior to replacing WIC benefits.

[Several clusters of cases of infection with _C. sakazakii_ linked to contaminated powdered infant formula have been reported in the past. This cluster appears to have dual contamination with this organism and _Salmonella_ Newport.

_Cronobacter sakazakii_ is a facultative anaerobic gram-negative bacillus that belongs to the Enterobacteriaceae family. The organism has been implicated in neonatal intensive care unit outbreaks of meningitis, septicemia, and necrotizing enterocolitis, particularly in preterm infants, although infections due to _C. sakazakii_ can occur in older infants, children, and adults.

The association of neonatal infection due to _C. sakazakii_ with the use of powdered infant formula is not new. ProMED has previously reported on infection associated with powdered infant formula contaminated by _C. sakazakii_ (formerly called _Enterobacter sakazakii_) as seen in the "See Also" section below.

The organism has been associated with a number of different kinds of powdered formulas from many different countries, including the USA (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. _Enterobacter sakazakii_ infections associated with the use of powdered infant formula - Tennessee, 2001. MMWR. 2002; 51(14): 297-300).

Genotyping has shown that patient and formula isolates shared the same typing pattern (Clark N C, Hill B C, O'Hara C M, et al. Epidemiologic typing of _Enterobacter sakazakii_ in 2 neonatal nosocomial outbreaks. Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis. 1990; 13(6): 467-72; doi: 10.1016/0732-8893(90)90078-a).

_Cronobacter_ are frequently isolated from the environment, plant material (wheat, rice, herbs, and spices) and various food products. Ingredients, such as starches from wheat and rice, can be a source of _Cronobacter_ that have been found to contaminate powdered infant formula.

Because powdered infant formulas are not necessarily sterile and may contain pathogenic bacteria, recommendations have been made concerning preparation and handling of these products (Agostoni C, Axelsson I, Goulet O, et al. Preparation and handling of powdered infant formula: a commentary by the ESPGHAN committee on nutrition. J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr. 2004; 39(4): 320-22; doi: 10.1097/00005176-200410000-00002). - Mod.LL
