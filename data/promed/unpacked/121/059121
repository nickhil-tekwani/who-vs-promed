The FDA has confirmed 5 different strains of _Cronobacter sakazakii_ bacteria at a production plant that makes infant formula that has been linked to 4 illnesses and 2 deaths.

None of the 5 different strains matches 2 available samples from sick babies, according to an announcement from the FDA. The agency found 4 of the strains of the bacteria at the Abbott Nutrition plant in Sturgis, Michigan, and the company found 1 other.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] conducted whole genome sequencing on the 2 available patient samples and found that the _Cronobacter_ strains do not match any filed in the National Center for Biotechnology Informatics (NCBI) database. Product samples collected by the FDA at the facility were analyzed for _Cronobacter_ and were found to be negative. Federal public health officials at the FDA and CDC continue to warn parents and care givers to check any infant formula they have on hand for the following identifying information.

Certain Similac, Alimentum, or EleCare powdered infant formulas have been recalled. The products can be identified by the 7 to 9 digit code and expiration date on the bottom of the package. Products are included in the recall if they have all 3 items below:
- the first two digits of the code are 22 through 37 and
- the code on the container contains K8, SH, or Z2, and
- the expiration date is [1 Apr 2022] (April 2022) or later.

In addition to products described above, Abbott Nutrition has recalled Similac PM 60/40 with a lot code 27032K80 on cans or 27032K800 on cases. The FDA and officials with Abbott Nutrition are continuing to investigate the situation. The production plant in Sturgis, Michigan, is not in operation.

Some parents have reported difficulty in finding replacement products to feed their babies. "The FDA is working with Abbott Nutrition to better assess the impacts of the recall and understand production capacity at other Abbott facilities that produce some of the impacted brands," according to the federal agency. "We are also working with Abbott Nutrition on safe resumption of production at the Sturgis, MI, facility. We will continue discussion with Abbott Nutrition and other infant formula manufacturers and consider all tools available to support the supply of infant formula products."

Additional FDA information for parents and caregivers:
- If your regular formula is not available, contact your child's healthcare provider for recommendations on changing feeding practices.
- If you get infant formula through WIC [The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children], do not throw the formula out. Instead, take it to the store for a refund and exchange or call the company at 800-986-8540 to help you. WIC recipients should be able to obtain a different brand of similar formula. Call your local WIC clinic for more guidance.

Recalled powdered infant formulas have the potential to be contaminated with _Cronobacter_ bacteria, which can cause severe, life-threatening infections including sepsis or meningitis, an inflammation of the membranes that protect the brain and spine. Symptoms of sepsis and meningitis may include poor feeding, irritability, temperature changes, jaundice (yellow skin and whites of the eyes), grunting breaths, and abnormal body movements.

_Cronobacter_ infection may also cause bowel damage and may spread through the blood to other parts of the body.

[Since the last posting, the CDC has reported that it does not believe that _Salmonella_ was involved. Salmonellosis will not be mentioned in subsequent posts. The finding that the strains of _Cronobacter sakazakii_ found in the environment of the plant did not genetically match the clinical isolates (in other words, no "smoking gun"), does not exonerate the product, however.

Several clusters of cases of infection with _C. sakazakii_ linked to contaminated powdered infant formula have been reported in the past. This cluster may have dual contamination with this organism and _Salmonella_ Newport.

_Cronobacter sakazakii_ is a facultative anaerobic gram-negative bacillus that belongs to the Enterobacteriaceae family. The organism has been implicated in neonatal intensive care unit outbreaks of meningitis, septicemia, and necrotizing enterocolitis, particularly in preterm infants, although infections due to _C. sakazakii_ can occur in older infants, children, and adults.

The association of neonatal infection due to _C. sakazakii_ with the use of powdered infant formula is not new. ProMED has previously reported on infection associated with powdered infant formula contaminated by _C. sakazakii_ (formerly called _Enterobacter sakazakii_) as seen in the "See Also" section below.

The organism has been associated with a number of different kinds of powdered formulas from many different countries, including the USA (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. _Enterobacter sakazakii_ infections associated with the use of powdered infant formula - Tennessee, 2001. MMWR. 2002; 51(14): 297-300).

Genotyping has shown that patient and formula isolates shared the same typing pattern (Clark N C, Hill B C, O'Hara C M, et al. Epidemiologic typing of _Enterobacter sakazakii_ in 2 neonatal nosocomial outbreaks. Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis. 1990; 13(6): 467-72; doi: 10.1016/0732-8893(90)90078-a).

_Cronobacter_ are frequently isolated from the environment, plant material (wheat, rice, herbs, and spices) and various food products. Ingredients, such as starches from wheat and rice, can be a source of _Cronobacter_ that have been found to contaminate powdered infant formula.

Because powdered infant formulas are not necessarily sterile and may contain pathogenic bacteria, recommendations have been made concerning preparation and handling of these products (Agostoni C, Axelsson I, Goulet O, et al. Preparation and handling of powdered infant formula: a commentary by the ESPGHAN committee on nutrition. J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr. 2004; 39(4): 320-22; doi: 10.1097/00005176-200410000-00002). - Mod.LL
