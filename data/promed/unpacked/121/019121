Jamaica. 4 Feb 2019. (published) A major chikungunya epidemic hit Jamaica in 2014 but no chikungunya-associated deaths were reported. We assessed the excess of all-cause deaths during this epidemic. Excess deaths were estimated by difference between observed and expected mortality based on the average age-specific mortality rate of 2012-2013, using the 99% confidence interval. There was an excess of 2499 deaths during the epidemic (91.9/100 000 population), and a strong positive correlation between the monthly incidence of chikungunya and the excess of deaths (Rho = 0.939, p less than 0.005).

[Interestingly, excess mortality was reported in Guadeloupe and Martinique during the 2014 chikungunya outbreak. In that report, there were excess deaths in almost all age-groups, and excess mortality rate was higher among the elderly but was similar between male and female individuals. The overall mortality estimated in that study (639 deaths) was about 4 times greater than that obtained through death declarations (160 deaths) https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/epidemiology-and-infection/article/excess-mortality-in-guadeloupe-and-martinique-islands-of-the-french-west-indies-during-the-chikungunya-epidemic-of-2014/F99ED8D846ECFF3DAB33F30CCFAE5223. - Mod.TY]
