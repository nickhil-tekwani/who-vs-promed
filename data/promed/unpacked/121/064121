The source of the _E. coli_ [O157] outbreak in Brazos County has been linked to ground beef from a local restaurant, according to a press release from the Brazos County Health Department [BCHD]. Despite requests from News 3, health department officials would not release the name of the restaurant, but they say the restaurant has been fully cooperative during the investigation.

Officials say 5 cases of _E. coli_ were confirmed in Brazos County. 5 other cases were investigated due to the criteria of symptoms, but they have not been confirmed. "Control measures have been implemented to prevent further cases including mandatory glove use by employees and continuous monitoring by BCHD," said the Health Department in a press release.

The press release goes on to say that, "This was an isolated incident and is not a ongoing threat to public health. It's not known if the cause is due to improper temperature, improper cooking, or cross contamination."

The Brazos County Health Department and Texas Department of State Health Services have concluded their investigation at this time.

[Ground beef is the original vehicle for EHEC:

The seminal outbreak of EHEC O157:H7 was associated with undercooked ground beef and this vehicle will remain prototypically associated with the infection. Commercial ground beef is not simply a piece of meat that is run through a grinder but rather it is usually produced in bulk using the parts of the cow remaining after primal cuts of beef (to produce steaks and roasts) are removed, usually from multiple cows and even different slaughterhouses. This lower grade product, called beef trim, tends to be cut from the parts of the cow more likely to have had contact with bovine feces.
