A confirmation of type C will be a very interesting epidemiological event.
At a global level, it has been a number of years since an outbreak of
serotype C has been reported. So, the question will arise as to where this
virus has been hiding for this length of time, and what the closest
sequence is in the current type C data bank.

A colleague pointed out that Manaus is actually the end of ocean-going boat
navigation on the Amazon.
Do you know whether the report in ProMED-mail on FMD in Brazil, dated Fri
24 Sep 2004, was limited to cattle, or, were swine (domestic, feral, or
wild) involved? They mentioned one swine but no infection reported in that
animal, but they were continuing with their investigations into the
possible source of the infection.
Often, initial outbreaks begin in swine who are fed raw garbage, containing
meat scraps from incoming ships. They in turn can spread the disease to
cattle by contact exposure. An answer is often difficult to find, although
the veterinary authorities would most likely know. They did address this in
a report to OIE.

Because of a decade of FMD type C being absent from South America, I and
several others have argued for a long time that C type antigen should be
deleted the from the vaccine, and all handling of live C virus in
laboratories and vaccine production facilities should be stopped. The
National diagnostic laboratory for FMD is located in Belem, a city at the
mouth of the Amazon river.

The appearance of an emergent outbreak of foot and mouth disease type C in
that region after so many years could be explained by a possible role of
wild animals as reservoirs.
Those [wildlife reservoirs - Mod PC] should be suspected in the maintenance
of the infection. If the ecology of the involved area can be described and
studied, serologic samplings taken from these wildlife species would be
difficult to obtain, but also would be of great value. [I hope Dr Orjuela
will forgive me, but I have edited his comments. Cloven-hoofed wild animals
and others species such as armadillos, nutrias, and capybaras are
potentially susceptible. - Mod.PC]

[The Reference Lab at the Institute for Animal Health, Pirbright does not
show any isolates of Type C after 1996. During this period, most of the
outbreaks in South America were either Type A, Type O, or a mixture of both
types. Between 1990 and 1996, there were 29 reports of type C virus, almost
all from Asia. Nepal led the list with 14 isolates, Philippines was next
with 8 isolates, and one came from the Soviet Union (1991).
The data obviously indicate that Type C has been absent from the world
scene for several years now. It is very important to figure out exactly how
it came back and to ensure that it is contained on the island in the
Amazon. This posting intimates several competing hypotheses for the unusual
occurrence of type C. We should certainly put significant efforts into
finding out more about the epidemiology of this outbreak. If not, we
shouldn't be surprised if the FMD virus continues to roll back efforts to
contain and eradicate it, as it has over the past 3 years. - Mod.PC]
