[C] Update 35 - Update on China: New numbers, May Day holiday reduced -- 21
Apr 2003 <http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_04_21/en/>
China
The Chinese government today announced a further 109 SARS cases in Beijing.
This latest report comes after Sunday's announcement of 339 previously
undisclosed SARS patients. There is no breakdown of the number of patients
in regular and military hospitals. The new numbers bring the total of
confirmed cases in China to 1959.
In an indication that the Chinese leadership is now taking seriously the
need for transparency in SARS reporting, the health minister and Beijing
mayor, both of whom played down the seriousness of SARS, were removed from
their Communist Party posts.
China also reduced its traditional week-long May Day holiday to a single
day, a period when hundreds of thousands of people generally travel
throughout the country. "The purpose of such an act is to prevent the
massive movement of people and the possible spread of the disease," said
Gao Qiang, an executive vice health minister.
A 6 member WHO team also arrived this morning to investigate SARS in
Shanghai. Shanghai has officially confirmed 2 probable cases of SARS. No
deaths have yet been reported in Shanghai.
The WHO team will conduct a 4 day probe in which they will confer with
local health authorities, inspect hospitals, and examine measures taken to
prevent and control the spread of SARS.

Situation report on atypical pneumonia 21 Apr 2003
--------------------------------------------------
The following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the
Hospital Authority:
As of 1 PM 21 Apr 2003, there are an additional 22 patients confirmed to
have atypical pneumonia following admission to public hospitals earlier.
They include 6 health care workers (2 from Princess Margaret Hospital, 2
from Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole, one from Queen Elizabeth Hospital, and
one from Tsuen Wan Adventist Hospital). The remaining 16 were other
patients and contacts of patients with atypical pneumonia.
A total of 436 patients have recovered from atypical pneumonia and have
been discharged from public hospitals. Of them, 27 were discharged today.
105 patients are receiving treatment in intensive care units.
6 patients died in Kwong Wah Hospital (KWH), Princess Margaret Hospital
(PMH), Prince of Wales Hospital (PWH), and United Christian Hospital (UCH).
This brought to 94 the total number of deaths relating to atypical
pneumonia. The 6 deceased, aged from 48 to 79, include 2 women and 4 men
who all have a history of chronic disease.
The cumulative figure for patients who have been admitted to public
hospitals with atypical pneumonia since 12 Mar 2003 is as follows:
Cumulative no. cases/ total no. discharged patients/ total no. deaths*
Health care workers of hospitals/clinics and medical students: 321 / 120 / ?
Patients, family members & visitors: 1081 / 316 / ?
Total: 1402 / 436 / 94
* Most of the deaths occurred in individuals who have a history of chronic
diseases, or were patients who sought treatment at a relatively late stage
of infection.

SARS Situation Update 21 Apr 2003
---------------------------------
As of 21 Apr 2003, 64 SARS patients remain in hospital. There are 6
additional SARS cases reported today. One is a 63 year old man who was
admitted to the National University Hospital (NUH) on 8 Apr 2003 for
uncontrolled high blood pressure and was a contact of a SARS patient who
was admitted to NUH on 8 Apr 2003, transferred to [Tan Tock Seng Hospital]
TTSH on 9 Apr 2003, and died on 12 Apr 2003.
The second case, a 45 year old man, works in Pasir Panjang Wholesale
Centre. The third case is a 22 year old domestic worker of a patient who
was in Singapore General Hospital (SGH) Ward 58. She had attended to her
employer while she was in hospital at SGH. The 61 year old employer herself
was diagnosed with SARS on 16 Apr 2003.
The 3 remaining cases are the grandchildren of a 72 year old man who was
admitted as a suspect SARS case on 19 Apr 2003 and works in the Pasir
Panjang Wholesale Centre. The children are aged 4, 8, and 9 years. One is
in kindergarten and the other 2 are in primary school. They had not
attended school since the closure of all national schools and pre school
centres on 27 Mar 2003.
Precautionary measures in private hospitals
To minimise the risk of cross infection between private hospitals, [from]
Tuesday, 22 Apr 2003, all doctors who are employed or working in private
sector hospitals are required to register to work in only one hospital.
This also applies to nurses who are self-employed or from private nursing
agencies and locum doctors.
Similarly, with immediate effect, inter-hospital transfer of inpatients has
been stopped. However, any patients who require specialised care that is
not being provided by the hospital in which they have been warded can be
transferred to the appropriate public sector hospital for management. For
emergency medical situations, however, hospitals may call upon the services
of the specialists required, even if they are not on the registered list
for the hospital. Similarly, should the patient require urgent transfer to
another medical facility, public or private, for emergency treatment, this
can proceed. Similar to current practice in public hospitals, patients
requiring re-admission within 21 days of their discharge from a private
hospital will be re-admitted to the same hospital. The only exception is
where they prefer to be admitted to a public sector hospital, which will be
allowed due to financial considerations.
Contact tracing for Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre
As of this afternoon, 728 tenants of the Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre
have been contacted. A total of 410 home quarantine orders have been served
so far. Contact tracing is still in progress.
Summary of SARS cases to date:
Discharged: 104
In hospital: 64 (including 18 in intensive care)
Deaths: 14 + 2 (pending further postmortem test results)
Total: 184
Suspected: 82 (including 4 children under 18 years)
Under home quarantine orders: 793

Survival of Coronaviruses in the environment
--------------------------------------------
ProMED-mail post "SARS - worldwide (60): cases 20030420.0972", quotes a CDC
expert as saying that the virus can remain potent on objects much longer
than previously thought: "....in their studies, they found that you could
still culture viable virus from surfaces after as much as 24 hours, which
is longer than we normally expect viruses to be able to survive in the
environment."
I am unaware of any literature on the environmental stability of human
coronaviruses, but rat coronavirus, which causes a pneumonia in rats, when
dried on plastic and then rehydrated 48 hours later is still viable. The
decrease in viral titer is 1000-fold after 24 hours and 10 000-fold after
48 hours (Laboratory Animal Science 43: 403-4).

[The survival time of the SARS-associated coronavirus in the environment is
highly relevant to interpretation of the epidemiology of SARS. Like other
respiratory viruses with lipid envelopes coronaviruses are susceptible to
inactivation by heat, desiccation, lipid solvents, oxidising agents,
nonionic detergents, and ultraviolet irradiation. Some coronaviruses
exhibit unexpected (pH (3.0) stability. Survival times will depend on virus
genotype (for example, human coronavirus 229E is more thermolabile than
human coronavirus OC43), composition of the carrier and substrate (Susan
Compton has given an example for rat coronavirus), and specific
circumstances (for example, bovine coronavirus can remain infectious in
milk for many days). In general respiratory viruses transmitted in aerosols
or in droplets would be expected to have a limited range and duration of
infectivity, whereas viruses transmitted in a more protective medium, such
as feces, might be expected to contaminate the environment for longer
periods. The epidemiological situation in Hong Kong suggests that more than
one route of transmission is being observed in the case of the SARS virus.

[A] Taiwan (from Channel Asia News)
<http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/38009/1/.html>
Taiwan may have registered its first SARS death after an elderly man
suspected of suffering from the disease died over the weekend. The resident
of the offshore island of Kinmen died at Taipei's Veterans General
Hospital. Officials are investigating the case.
[B] India, Maharashtra (from ) 21 Apr 2003 20:16 IST
<http://www.rediff.com/news/2003/apr/21sars1.htm>
3 SARS cases in Maharashtra
---------------------------
Three members of a family have tested positive for SARS, according to
Maharashtra's minister for health, Digvijay Khanvilkar. [The 3], who came
to India 3 weeks ago, have been isolated in a ward of the Siddhartha
Hospital, he said. The family had visited Jakarta and [other parts of? -
Mod.JW] Indonesia recently. [One of them] was admitted to the hospital on
17 Apr 2003 and the other 2 on 19 Apr 2003. Their samples were sent to the
National Institute of Virology in Pune, and tested positive, Khanvilkar said.

<promed@promedmail.org>
[According to today's worldwide update from WHO [1][A] a cumulative total
of 3861 cases of SARS and 217 deaths (case fatality rate of 5.6 per cent)
have been reported through 21 Apr 2003. Since the last reported update, 495
new cases have been reported, reflecting to a large extent the additional
447 cases reported from China, which include "old cases" that had not been
reported (as discussed in [1][C] and in ProMED-mail posting SARS -
worldwide (60): cases 20030420.0972) as well as the new cases identified
since the last update on 19 Apr 2003. In addition, the United States has
now begun reporting only probable cases of SARS, so today's report from the
US reflects a decrease in the number of cases reported in the previous
update when suspected and probable cases were reported daily. As of 21 Apr
2003, 1873 SARS cases have been reported as having recovered, giving a
reported recovery rate of 48.5 per cent. As an aside, it would be helpful
to see an official Chinese analysis, either daily or weekly, by province to
help monitor the outbreak, rather than to rely upon newswires and speculation.
The newswire report from India [6][B] is a bit disturbing. As mentioned in
prior ProMED-mail postings, the current case definition for probable cases
of SARS is based on clinical and epidemiological criteria and NOT on
laboratory diagnostic testing, as the sensitivity and specificity of the
current diagnostic tests is unknown and under investigation. It appears
that the Indian cases had traveled to Indonesia, where local transmission
has not been documented as yet. The cases traveled 3 weeks before the onset
of this illness, whereas the current estimate of the incubation period for
SARS is 2 to 10 days. The newswire does not provide the clinical symptoms
of this supposed family cluster, but the epidemiological information
provided seems incompatible with SARS, unless there is local transmission
in Indonesia previously undetected, the incubation period can be as long as
3 weeks, or there is local transmission ongoing in India that has not been
detected as yet. We await further clarification of this, but are concerned
to read newswires now confirming cases based on laboratory diagnostic
testing. (This is not the first instance of this -- see ProMED-mail posting
SARS - worldwide (57): cases 20030418.0952). - Mod.MPP]
