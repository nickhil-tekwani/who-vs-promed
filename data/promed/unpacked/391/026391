10 Ohio Horses Dead; Possible Equine Herpesvirus-1 Outbreak
-------------------
At least 10 horses have died or have been euthanized at the University of
Findlay (UF) in Findlay, Ohio, after battling a respiratory and neurologic
illness. Preliminary polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests completed on
tissue samples from affected horses by the Ohio Department of Agriculture
(ODA) Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory this morning came back as
"presumptive positive" for equine herpesvirus type-1 (EHV-1). Officials
from the veterinary services department at the University of Findlay and
epidemiologists and scientists from The Ohio State University (OSU) are
working together today to treat at least 11 affected horses with supportive
care and to determine the source of infection. The presumptive findings
from the PCR tests will be verified by gene sequence analysis, with
assistance from OSU. The results will be available from ODA in 2 to 3 days.

The EHV-1 organism can cause 3 different forms of disease, including
rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease of mostly young horses), abortions
in pregnant mares, and a neurologic disease. Officials believe this strain,
if confirmed as EHV-1, could be one that combines the respiratory and
neurologic clinical signs. There are at least 7 other strains of equine
herpesviruses, named in order of their discovery. (See article #32 at
for more on herpesviruses.) The neurologic form of EHV-1
often is survivable with supportive care, but unfortunately once a horse is
recumbent, it is difficult to nurse the horse back to health.

According to Mark Anthony, communications director for the ODA in
Reynoldsburg, Ohio, gross lesions reported by OSU on tissue samples (brain
and spinal cord) obtained from a necropsy appeared to be consistent with EHV-1.

"As of last night (21 Jan 2003), 10 had either died or been euthanized
because of the disease," said Anthony. "A necropsy was performed on at
least one, and that was performed at The Ohio State University. It was from
that necropsy that we obtained spinal cord and brain tissue samples, which
we tested." PCR tests were conducted on a number of samples, and 2 bone
blood sample and one nasal swab from affected horses" were presumptive
positive for EHV-1.

"We are seeing respiratory symptoms before neurological disorders," said
Anthony. On Wed 15 Jan 2003, a number of horses had fevers of up to 105
degrees F. A University of Findlay veterinary services staff member said
that a few of these horses developed nasal discharge, became depressed, and
were not eating. By Fri 17 Jan 2003, the more seriously affected horses
showed neurological signs including toe-dragging and wobbling of the hind
end. Eventually some of the animals went down and were unable to rise.
Around 30 horses of the 130 exposed at the facility were showing some
symptoms of the illness by 17 Jan 2003.

EHV is not considered a reportable disease in Ohio, so OSU and University
of Findlay personnel are handling the disease investigation.

Anthony said, "When there is an outbreak of a foreign animal disease or an
infectious contagious disease on our reportable disease list, we are in
charge of coordinating the investigation. That is not the case here. We are
identifying the virus responsible for the outbreak."

3 members of OSU's faculty and staff in the Veterinary Preventive Medicine
department have traveled to Findlay today, including one clinician familiar
with neurological illness and one epidemiologist. A staff veterinarian from
the Ohio Department of Agriculture is assisting.

PCR tests are very specific, and according to Anthony, other possible
causes of the clinical signs such as Eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE)
and Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (VEE), which are both reportable
diseases in Ohio, have been all but ruled out.

Bev Byrum, DVM, PhD, Lab Director at the Animal Disease Diagnostic
Laboratory, said, "PCR technology allows us to work quickly in outbreaks
like this to identify the agent causing the infection. In this case, we
will probably know definitively in a couple more days. Under our previous
standard testing procedures for growing and isolating a virus, we would be
looking at 2 weeks minimum before we got a confirmed finding."

The source of the disease is currently unknown. A veterinary services (VS)
staff member at Findlay said a new semester began at the university in
early January 2003, with student-owned and school horses arriving 4 Jan
2003 from all over the state of Ohio. It is unclear whether any of the
horses were imported previously from Europe, where the neurological form of
equine herpesvirus is seen more frequently than in the United States.

"The horses in question were reported to us to have been vaccinated," said
Anthony. The VS staff member confirmed that vaccinations, including
influenza and rhinopneumonitis, were given properly. A negative Coggins
test and strangles vaccination also are required for horses arriving on the
university's premises. The natural inclination of horse owners would be to
ask why horses were infected with this disease if they were current on
their vaccinations. Veterinarians have said in the past that no vaccine
manufacturer has made a vaccine that guarantees that it will prevent the
neurological form of EHV-1, and that no vaccine is 100 percent effective.

A strict self-imposed quarantine is in effect for the English riding
facility where the outbreak occurred, and area horse owners have been
advised to quarantine their horses. It is not clear how officials will be
handling carcass disposal, but Anthony assured that the state of Ohio has
specific guidelines for proper management of diseased carcasses.
