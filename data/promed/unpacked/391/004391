According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) report issued on 10 Sep 2021, 30 cases of pneumonic plague have been reported in the Republic of Madagascar. Pneumonic plague, one of several forms of plague, is endemic in Madagascar. The WHO previously confirmed that 7 cases have been fatal, all of them in the municipality of Miandrandra. Madagascar's last major plague outbreak was in 2017, which resulted in 209 deaths; these were classified as pneumonic plague.

The plague is caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_ and is mainly transmitted to humans through bites of infected fleas, says the CDC. _Y. pestis_ is easily destroyed by sunlight and drying. Even so, when released into the air [from a patient with plague pneumonia or from a bioterrorism event - Mod.LL], the bacterium will survive for up to one hour, although this could vary depending on conditions. To reduce the chance of death, antibacterials must be given within 24 hours of 1st symptoms. Streptomycin, gentamicin, tetracyclines, and chloramphenicol are all effective against pneumonic plague.

Because human plague is rare in most parts of the world, there is no need to vaccinate persons other than those at particularly high risk of exposure, says the CDC. In 2020, US FDA inventors confirmed they had developed a new candidate oral vaccine against plague. This vaccine consists of a synthetic gene construct that expresses a _Y. pestis_ F1-V fusion antigen linked to a secretion signal, resulting in the production of large amounts of the F1-V antigen. The F1-V synthetic gene fusion is cloned within Ty21a, an attenuated typhoid fever strain licensed for human use as a live oral bacterial vaccine.

Madagascar is located off the east coast of central Africa, with about 28 million residents.

Epidemiological summary:

On 29 Aug 2021, an alert was made by the health authorities of the Arivonimamo district, in the Itasy region of Madagascar, regarding cases of pneumonic plague. As of 3 Sep 2021, a total of 30 cases of pneumonic plague, including 12 confirmed cases and 7 deaths (CFR=23%), have been reported.

According to media, the 1st case was in a patient who died in the week starting 23 Aug 2021 but was not reported by relatives. A 2nd person died in the same family a week later. According to the same report, the Ministry of Public Health confirmed a diagnosis of pneumonic plague.

Media quoting the Madagascar Ministry of Health reports that the 7 deaths occurred in the municipality of Miandrandra. Of these, 3 died in hospital and 4 in the community; 22 other patients are being treated.

The municipality of Miandrandra is in the Arivonimamo district, Itasy region of Madagascar, in the centre of the island and 40 km [25 mi] southwest of the capital, Antananarivo. The municipality has been quarantined. Internal movement is banned for residents of the 6 municipalities of the Arivonimamo district.

Active case finding and chemoprophylaxis for high-risk contacts are ongoing. Further activities include regular meetings of the plague control committees at regional and health district levels; mass sensitization activities; contact tracing; and vector and animal reservoir control activities. An awareness campaign is being carried out in parallel about the practice of famadihana, or ceremony of turning the dead, considered as one of the possible mechanisms of spreading the disease.

Background:

Plague is endemic in Madagascar. The last large outbreak of plague in Madagascar in 2017 resulted in 2417 confirmed, probable, and suspected cases, including 209 deaths (case fatality rate 8.7%) reported from 57 of 114 districts in the country. Of these, 1854 (77%) were clinically classified as pneumonic plague, 355 (15%) were bubonic plague, one was septicemic, and 207 were not classified. At least 81 healthcare workers contracted plague during the outbreak. Of the 1854 clinical cases of pneumonic plague, 390 (21%) were confirmed.

ECDC assessment:

While plague outbreaks in Madagascar are not unexpected, pneumonic plague is of concern due to its potential for spreading via human-to-human transmission, especially in densely populated areas. The risk to EU/EEA citizens is low.

Actions:

ECDC monitors the plague epidemiological situation worldwide through epidemic intelligence activities and reports when relevant.

["Itasy is a region in central Madagascar. It borders Analamanga region in northeast, Vakinankaratra in south, and Bongolava in northwest. The capital of the region is Miarinarivo."
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itasy_Region)

The initial report did not specify the specific location other than it is not far from Antananarivo.

Plague infections in Madagascar have been relatively quiet since the dramatic outbreak in 2017.

The following paragraph is from Chanteau S, Ratsifasoamanana L, Rasoamanana B, et al. Plague, a reemerging disease in Madagascar. Emerg Infect Dis. 1998; 4(1): 101-4; http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/4/1/98-0114_article.htm:

"Between 1930 and 1990, bubonic plague had 'virtually disappeared' on the island due to efficient pest control and good health management. However, since 1990, an annual 200 cases are being reported, and bubonic plague takes on epidemic form, especially in the port of Mahajanga, each year. In the capital city of Antananarivo, more cases are being notified each year since 1990. Madagascar (pop. 13 million) has accounted for 45% of all the cases of plague in Africa."

Fatalities related to plague usually are caused by spread of the organism from the bubo (the very painful infected lymph node that drains the area where the flea bite occurred) to the bloodstream. The bacteremia can cause a coagulopathy, producing the purpura seen in the "black plague," and also may spread to the lungs causing a hemorrhagic pneumonia. It is the pneumonia that can facilitate person-to-person transmission. Not all initial cases of plague pneumonia occur with a preceding bubonic phase, and when the lung infection spreads from person-to-person, there is no bubonic stage. - Mod.LL
