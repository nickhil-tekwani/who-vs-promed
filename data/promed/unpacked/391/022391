More than 20 people are part of a multi-country _Listeria_ outbreak traced to fish and 5 have died since 2014.

An outbreak assessment by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) identified 22 listeriosis cases caused by _Listeria monocytogenes_ sequence type (ST) 1247, clonal complex 8 through whole genome sequencing (WGS).

Both agencies warned new cases cannot be ruled out until the point of contamination in an Estonian food processing plant has been identified. It builds on an assessment from March this year [2019] when 18 cases were identified. At that time, the Estonian fish processor, a firm called MV Wool, denied the link.

Outbreak cases yearly since 2014: Denmark has 9 cases, Estonia 6, Finland 2, France 1, and Sweden 4. The 1st case had symptom onset in July 2014 in Estonia. The most recent occurred in Denmark in February this year [2019].

"Outbreak cases have been reported every year since 2014, with a small clustering of cases between the end of 2015, 2016, and 2018, and the start of the following year. Estonia, Finland, and Sweden reported cases in the 1st 2 years of this outbreak; since January 2017, all cases with the exception of 1 case in France in 2018 have been reported in Estonia and Denmark," according to ECDC.

Out of 12 patients for whom a food consumption history was available, 8 confirmed eating cold-smoked fish products.

Information on age and gender is available for 20 patients, with the median age being 76 years; most are older than 50, except for 1 neonatal case reported in 2014. 11 patients are male and 9 are female.

Food and environmental investigations: _L. monocytogenes_ food isolates, matching the human outbreak strain by WGS, were detected at wholesale and retail level in France, Denmark, Italy, and Sweden from 13 batches of cold smoked or gravad salmon and from 6 batches of cold smoked trout products.

In 16 batches, _Listeria_ was detected at less than 10 colony forming units per gram (cfu/g), in one batch at less than 40 cfu/g, and in 2 cold-smoked trout batches, it was enumerated at 400 cfu/g and 570 cfu/g.

Traceability information pointed to the Estonian firm MV Wool as the common manufacturer of fish products. Raw fish was received from suppliers in Norway and Finland.

As of [20 Mar 2019], the processing company can only release cold-smoked and salted fish products after the verification of 'absence of _L. monocytogenes_ in 25 gram', following a request from the Estonian authority.

Environmental investigations and food testing at the Estonian processing plant showed _L. monocytogenes_ that matched the outbreak strain in 2 samples on the processing line and in 4 batches of final product.

"The presence of _L. monocytogenes_ matching the outbreak strain over several years in the fish products suggests the persistence of the microorganism at the Estonian company's premises. Further investigation is needed to identify points of (cross-) contamination in the food processing plant," according to ECDC.

[_Listeria_-contaminated, refrigerated, ready-to-eat products (that is, products that do not require further cooking before eating, such as smoked fish or cold-cut meats, like ham or pork) are well-recognized sources for listeriosis. Unpasteurized milk and cheese and other milk products made from unpasteurized milk, as well as milk and milk products contaminated with _Listeria_ only after pasteurization, are other sources of listeriosis.

_Listeria monocytogenes_ is widely distributed in the environment where it can form biofilms, which enable the organism to attach to solid surfaces and become extremely difficult to remove, especially in parts of food-processing equipment that are difficult to access. In past listeriosis outbreaks, _Listeria_ contamination of food products occurred in parts of equipment "well beyond the [manufacturer's] recommended sanitation process" and was "found only after the devices were completely disassembled" (https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/maple-leaf-eyes-meat-slicers-in-outbreak/article1060898/). Even if equipment used in food processing only adds a few organisms to the food, the contamination can be significant for refrigerated ready-to-eat food, because _L. monocytogenes_ can subsequently multiply at refrigerator temperatures to sufficient size to cause disease.

This epidemiologic investigation shows the power of genotyping clinical and environmental isolates to confirm the source of an outbreak. - Mod.ML
