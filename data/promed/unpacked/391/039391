What I find interesting is the fact a baby bear (bear cub) is allowed to be
put in a petting zoo, so that ignorant people can "play" with it. There is
a reason why "wild" i.e., non-domesticated, animals are behind cages or
walls at a zoo. First, there has been no indication as to how the cub got
rabies. Second, as far as Iowa is concerned, skunks are generally first
when it comes to reporting rabies and bovine are second (Ref.
www.uhl.uiowa.edu). Cats, as far as the numbers show, are as high risk as
any animal you choose to let roam freely. The bottom line is there are
risks of
contracting infectious disease anywhere you go. It is the job of
physicians, public health professionals, and veterinarians to tell people
the importance of vaccination and other preventative measures. I'm not
discounting the few or the many that do, but I'm just stating the health
community needs to be more explicit and persuasive on these issues. It is
one thing to decide for yourself if you need a vaccination, but it is
another for your animal or child. They don't have a vote in the
decision---You do. Public awareness is everything!
