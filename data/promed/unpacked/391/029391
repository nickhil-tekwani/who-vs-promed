[1] Pandemic winter prediction

The United States has seen a decline in cases and hospitalizations since the summer's delta surge, but the decline is declining.

COVID-19 is still killing more than 1000 people in the US every day. New cases still hover around 72 000 per day, and infections are actually trending up in some pockets of the country, including parts of the Mountain West and the Northeast.

"Certainly, things are going in the right direction with the diminution of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths," Dr. Anthony Fauci, chief medical adviser to the president for COVID-19, told NPR's Mary Louise Kelly. "The steepness of the deflection is not as good as it was, let's say, a month or so ago ... it's down to a lower number."

The concern among health officials like Fauci is that winter holidays and cold weather will soon bring about more travel and indoor gatherings, where a respiratory virus will transmit more easily.

So at this stage of the pandemic, what is the goal? Fauci offered a qualitative assessment. "We're looking for a level of control ... where the level of infection -- due to vaccination predominantly, but also people who may have been infected and have some degree of protection -- that doesn't disrupt society the way the COVID-19 outbreak is currently doing with us."

Measuring that goal will be "multiphase," he said. Deaths and hospitalizations are an important indicator, but so is the count of infections, and so is the vaccination rate as a way of helping prevent severe disease. "We want to do all of the above," Fauci said.

Fauci noted that the country "need[s] to do better" with adolescent vaccination rates and pointed out that over 60 million people in the US have been eligible for vaccination but are not yet vaccinated. But he said "something that's in our favor" is the opportunity to inoculate around 28 million children aged 5-11 who became eligible to receive a vaccine this week.

"So as we go into the winter months with the challenge of a respiratory infection being worse in the winter months, we can get through this if we really put a lot of effort into getting as many people vaccinated as we possibly can," Fauci said.

He urged parents to get their 5-11-year-old children vaccinated, citing "really good efficacy and really good safety profile."

"I would tell the parents: Although it is less likely for a child to get a serious result from infection than in adults, particularly an elderly adult, it is not something that's trivial with children," he said.

He also commented on the development of anti-COVID pills that may reduce the severity of infections. An antiviral drug made by Merck also won authorization in the UK on Thursday [4 Nov 2021]. And the pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced Friday [5 Nov 2021] that its antiviral drug reduced the risk of hospitalization or death by 89% in a clinical trial.

"The results were really quite striking," Fauci said of the Pfizer data. However, he cautioned that the promise of therapeutic drugs was no substitute for vaccinations that would prevent or diminish infections in the 1st place. "The best way traditionally -- not only with COVID-19, but with any infection -- it is always, always better to prevent it than to have to worry about treating it," he said.

[2] US (Texas): deaths
Date: Mon 8 Nov 2021 06:53 p.m. EST

Unvaccinated Texans were far more likely to catch COVID-19 or die from the disease than vaccinated residents during the coronavirus' September [2021] spike, state health officials said Monday [8 Nov 2021], as Texas grapples with a larger weekly COVID-19 death toll than any other state, and a lower-than-average vaccination rate.

Key facts
From early [September 2021 to 1 Oct 2021], vaccinated Texans were 13 times less likely to test positive for COVID-19 and 20 times less likely to die from the coronavirus than their unvaccinated peers, according to a Texas Department of State Health Services study.

Some 81.3% of the nearly 4500 coronavirus deaths studied over that time period were among unvaccinated people, whereas 13.7% of deaths were tied to fully vaccinated Texans and 5% were among partially vaccinated patients, researchers said.

The gulf between vaccinated and unvaccinated Texans is somewhat larger if data from earlier in the year is included: From mid-January [2021] to early October [2021], unvaccinated people made up 85.5% of the state's total COVID-19 deaths and were 40 times more likely to die.

The study suggested "the proportion of cases and deaths among vaccinated people is expected to rise" as vaccination rates increase, and said effectiveness varies depending on patients' immune systems or whether their immunity has worn off over time.

Similarly, a recent study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found vaccinated Americans were 11.3 times less likely to die of COVID-19 than unvaccinated people from late June to mid-July [2021], though the vaccines were slightly more effective at stopping infections, hospitalizations, and deaths before the virus' delta variant took root in June [2021].

Big number
777. That's how many Texans have died from COVID-19 in the last week, outpacing every other state, according to CDC data. Average daily deaths have dropped precipitously from over 300 in late September [2021] to slightly over 100 last week, and they're still well below their all-time high of more than 350 in mid-January [2021].

Tangent
Some 61.8% of Texans have received at least one coronavirus vaccine shot, and 53.7% are fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. The state lags slightly behind the national average: 67.5% of Americans are at least partially vaccinated, and 58.4% are fully vaccinated.

Key background
Texas has counted over 70 000 coronavirus fatalities since early 2020, representing more than 9% of the country's total death toll, though the state's total fatality rate -- 244 deaths per 100 000 residents -- is just slightly above a nationwide average of 226. Deaths accelerated in the state from mid-July [2021] and peaked in late September [2021], causing Texas and Florida to make up 40% of new nationwide COVID-19 infections during one week in August [2021]. Texas' summertime surge -- which drove up infections and deaths and put pressure on the state's hospitals -- coincided with the rise of the delta variant, which is more transmissible than previous forms of the coronavirus.

Surprising fact
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) is vaccinated against COVID-19, and he's called the vaccines safe and effective, but he issued an executive order last month [October 2021] largely banning businesses from mandating vaccines for customers and employees. The action came amid a nationwide pushback against vaccine mandates by Republican-controlled states.

[3] France: Valneva vaccine
Date: Tue 9 Oct 2021

https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2021/11/9/valneva-covid-19-vaccine-why-it-might-be-a-game-changer


Since their inception and rollout, COVID-19 vaccines have changed the course of the pandemic. Prior to the vaccines, we relied on social distancing measures to help reduce the spread of the virus and a handful of imperfect treatment options to treat those unlucky enough to become sick with it.

It is fair to say vaccines have saved countless lives.

Now French pharmaceutical company Valneva is throwing its hat into the vaccine ring, but it has a vaccine with a difference. Rather than induce an immune response that targets just the spike protein of the coronavirus, the Valneva vaccine, also known as VLA2001, stimulates an immune response to the entire virus, and that might just give it an edge over its competitors.

It is different in that it uses the tried-and-tested method of taking the whole of the coronavirus and inactivating it so that it can no longer cause illness. It then combines with an adjuvant, a substance that helps it enter human cells effectively.

A similar technique is used to make flu and polio vaccines. The idea is that by introducing a whole coronavirus into the human body, albeit one which has been inactivated and cannot cause illness, the immune system will recognise the whole virus as foreign and not just the spike proteins. This will give a much broader immune response and increase the memory cells that can recognise different parts of the virus should the vaccinated individual become infected with the real coronavirus.

The company say the advantage to this is that should any mutations arise on the spike protein that render it unrecognisable to the vaccine, the Valenva-induced immune response is broad enough to be able to recognise other parts of the virus so the immune reaction will still be effective.

Phase-3 trials for the Valneva vaccine were carried out on more than 4000 patients aged 18 years and older across 26 sites in the United Kingdom. The trials compared the immune response rates with those vaccinated with the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccines, and results showed that VLA2001 generated a stronger immune response than the AstraZeneca vaccine, with higher levels of neutralising COVID-19 antibodies in the blood.

Researchers also found no severe cases of COVID-19 among participants receiving the Valneva vaccine, despite the delta variant being in circulation during the trial.

A jab that produces a good immune response and may be able to protect against future mutations of the coronavirus is certainly a welcome addition to our vaccine arsenal. And with the shapeshifting nature of the virus, it is worth investing in vaccines that do not rely on just one part of its structure to generate protection. The delta variant has taught us not to underestimate the coronavirus, and with many poorer countries yet to vaccinate significant parts of their populations, there is a higher chance of new mutations arising.

But it is not without its controversy. The UK, which initially put in an order for 100 million doses, recently cancelled that order over allegations of breach of contract, something the pharmaceutical company strongly denies. The contract Valneva has with the UK government lists a broad range of potential breaches, and it is unclear which one the government is referring to, but "supply issues" have been mentioned.

Despite this, the manufacturers have applied to the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) for approval and expect to receive it by the end of the year [2021]. They are also preparing to submit a request with the European Medicines Agency. If they get that European approval, the UK government may well end up regretting their decision to cancel the order, as the vaccine is likely to be snapped up by other countries.

[4] Nasal spray vaccine
Date: Tue 9 Oct 2021

https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2021/11/9/valneva-covid-19-vaccine-why-it-might-be-a-game-changer


Most vaccines are given as an intramuscular injection, though some, like the polio vaccine, are given orally. Most children in the UK are given the flu vaccine as a nasal spray.

Nasal vaccines have their own advantages, one of which is the option of self-administration. Many bacteria that affect the respiratory system are breathed in, so the lining of the nasal passage and the airways are packed with immune cells to protect us from invading germs. Studies have shown that the flu vaccine given as a nasal spray not only induces a good immune response all over the body, but also locally around the nasal passageways, the doorway to respiratory infections.

One of the questions I am constantly being asked is: When will the COVID-19 vaccine become available as a nasal spray? For those who are needle phobic, it is an ideal way to administer a vaccine. And years of giving out the flu vaccine as a nasal spray to children have taught me that it is much easier than using a needle.

So it will be good news for many that a recent study led by the US-based National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has found giving the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine as a nasal spray reduced viral shedding in animal models. The study initially looked at hamsters, separating them into 2 groups: one was given the COVID-19 vaccine as an intramuscular injection, the other as a nasal spray. Both routes of administration produced high antibody levels, but the nasal spray outperformed the injection.

It then went on to compare unvaccinated monkeys with those who were given the nasal spray. Both sets of monkeys were exposed to the COVID-19 virus; the vaccinated monkeys had a low viral load in their noses and lung tissue, and none of them developed symptoms of pneumonia, while 3 of the unvaccinated monkeys did. Having a low viral load present in the nose after a nasal vaccine may be a game changer, as it could seriously reduce risk of onward transmission to other people.

Spurred on by the results of animal studies, researchers at Oxford University set up a Phase 1 trial looking at the effectiveness of the nasal spray vaccine in adult humans.

Thirty healthy volunteers aged between 18 and 40 were enrolled and investigated for the level of immune system responses generated by the vaccine using this delivery technique, as well as monitored for safety and for any adverse reactions. If the results of this small clinical trial are as promising as the animal trials have been, then it may make it easier to vaccinate those who are afraid of needles. If nasal vaccines do cut transmission rates, then that could change the course of the pandemic.

[B] WHO Weekly Epidemiological Summary
Date: Tue 9 Nov 2021
Source: WHO Emergency Situation Updates
https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/weekly-epidemiological-update-on-covid-19---9-november-2021


Overview
During the week [1-7 Nov 2021], a slight upward trend (1% increase) in new weekly cases was observed, with over 3.1 million new cases reported. Over 48 000 new deaths were reported, a 4% decrease from the previous week. The WHO European Region reported increases in case and death incidence, while other regions reported declines or stable trends. As of [7 Nov 2021], over 249 million confirmed cases and over 5 million deaths have been reported.

The regions reporting the highest weekly case incidence rates per 100 000 population were the European Region (208.9 new cases per 100 000 population) and the Region of the Americas (68.6 new cases per 100 000); the same 2 regions reported the highest weekly incidence in deaths, of 2.9 and 1.3 per 100 000 population, respectively.

The highest numbers of new cases were reported from the United States of America (510 968 new cases; 3% decrease), the Russian Federation (281 305 new cases; 3% increase), the United Kingdom (252 104 new cases; 12% decrease), Turkey (197 335 new cases; 8% increase), and Germany (169 483 new cases; 29% increase).

Special focus: Update on SARS-CoV-2 variants of interest and variants of concern
WHO, in collaboration with national authorities, institutions, and researchers, routinely assesses if variants of SARS-CoV-2 alter transmission or disease characteristics, or impact effectiveness of vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics, or public health and social measures (PHSM) applied by national authorities to control disease spread. Potential variants of concern (VOCs), variants of interest (VOIs), or variants under monitoring (VUMs) are regularly assessed based on the risk posed to global public health. As evidence becomes available, classifications of variants will be revised to reflect the continuous evolution of circulating variants and their changing epidemiology. Criteria for variant classification, and the current lists of VOCs, VOIs, and VUMs, are available on the WHO Tracking SARS-CoV-2 variants website. National authorities may choose to designate other variants of local interest/concern and are encouraged to investigate and report on impacts of these variants.

On [9 Nov 2021], a list of formerly monitored variants was included on the WHO Tracking SARS-CoV-2 variants website. This comprises former VOCs/VOIs/VUMs, including their lineages, that have been found to no longer be circulating at levels of global public health significance; had been circulating for a long time without major impacts on the overall epidemiological situation; or scientific evidence demonstrated that the variant is not associated with concerning properties. In addition to 3 previously reclassified variants, 10 VUMs were recently reclassified to this category based on diminishing numbers of detections and epidemiological risks. These variant classifications will be revisited if new evidence of epidemiological or phenotypic impacts becomes available.

Geographic spread and prevalence of VOCs
The current global genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by a predominance of the delta variant, with declining prevalence of other variants among sequences submitted to publicly available datasets or detections reported to WHO (Figure 4, Annex 1). Delta has outcompeted other variants, including other VOCs, in most countries. Of 814 165 sequences uploaded to GISAID with specimens collected in the last 60 days, 810 946 (99.6%) were delta; 1163 (0.1%), gamma; 400 (<0.1%), alpha; 23 (<0.1%), beta; and 0.2% comprised other circulating variants (including VOIs mu and lambda). Sub-regional and country-level variation continues to be observed, most notably within some South American countries, where the progression of the delta variant has been more gradual, and other variants (e.g., gamma, lambda, mu) still contribute a large proportion of reported sequences. Moreover, global VOCs distribution should be interpreted with due consideration of surveillance limitations, including differences in sequencing capacities and sampling strategies between countries, as well as delays in reporting.

WHO regional overviews, epidemiological week 1-7 Nov 2021

African Region
After a decreasing trend since July 2021, case incidence rates in the African Region have begun to plateau, with over 20 000 new cases reported this week. Over 500 new deaths were reported, a 27% decrease as compared to the previous week. However, substantial increases (greater than 15%) in new cases were reported in 1/3 of the countries in the region (15/49; 31%). The highest numbers of new cases were reported from Botswana (6341 new cases; 269.6 new cases per 100 000 population; a 279% increase; largely due to batch reporting), Ethiopia (2102 new cases; 1.8 new cases per 100 000; a 37% decrease), and South Africa (1865 new cases; 3.1 new cases per 100 000; a 27% decrease).

The highest numbers of new deaths were reported from South Africa (156 new deaths; <1 new death per 100 000 population; a 37% decrease), Ethiopia (80 new deaths; <1 new death per 100 000; a 32% decrease); and Cameroon (45 new deaths; <1 new death per 100 000; a 48% decrease).

Region of the Americas
The overall declining trend continued this week in the Region of the Americas, with over 701 000 new cases and over 13 000 new deaths reported, decreases of 5% and 14%, respectively, as compared to the previous week. Despite this, 9% (5/59) of countries reported an increase in the number of new cases in the past week. The highest numbers of new cases were reported from the United States of America (510 968 new cases; 154.4 new cases per 100 000; a 3% decrease), Brazil (69 057 new cases; 32.5 new cases per 100 000; a 15% decrease), and Mexico (19 543 new cases; 15.2 new cases per 100 000; a 4% increase).

The highest numbers of new deaths were reported from the United States of America (8101 new deaths; 2.4 new deaths per 100 000; a 15% decrease), Brazil (1598 new deaths; <1 new death per 100 000; a 31% decrease); and Mexico (1463 new deaths; 1.1 new deaths per 100 000; a 5% decrease).

Eastern Mediterranean Region
After a decreasing trend since mid-August 2021, case and death incidence rates in the Eastern Mediterranean Region have begun to plateau, with over 112 000 new cases and over 2200 new deaths reported. Out of the 22 countries in the Region, 4 reported an increase of over 10% in new cases, in the past week. The highest numbers of new cases were reported from the Islamic Republic of Iran that contributed to half of cases in the Region (64 049 new cases; 76.3 new cases per 100 000; similar to previous week), followed by Jordan (12 889 new cases; 126.3 new cases per 100 000; a 17% increase), and Iraq (7737 new cases; 19.2 new cases per 100 000; a 16% decrease).

The highest numbers of new deaths were reported from the Islamic Republic of Iran (1047 new deaths; 1.2 new deaths per 100 000; similar to previous week), Egypt (419 new deaths; <1 new death per 100 000; a 20% increase), and Iraq (181 new deaths: <1 new death per 100 000; a 10% decrease).

European Region
The European Region has continued to show an increasing trend in both cases and deaths, with over 1.9 million new cases and over 26 000 new deaths reported, increases of 7% and 10%, respectively, as compared to the previous week. Out of the 61 countries in the Region, 26 (42%) reported increases of 10% or more in cases in the past week. The highest numbers of new cases were reported from Russian Federation (281 305 new cases; 192.8 new cases per 100 000; a 3% increase), the United Kingdom (252 104 new cases; 371.4 new cases per 100 000; a 12% decrease), and Turkey (197 335 new cases; 234.0 new cases per 100 000; an 8% increase).

The highest numbers of new deaths were reported from the Russian Federation (8276 new deaths; 5.7 new deaths per 100 000; similar to the previous week's figures), Ukraine (4355 new deaths; 10.0 new deaths per 100 000; a 13% increase), and Romania (3158 new deaths; 16.3 new deaths per 100 000; similar to the previous week's figures).

South-East Asia Region
The South-East Asia Region reported over 157 000 new cases and over 3500 new deaths, a 13% and 29% decrease, respectively, as compared to the previous week. This declining trend has been observed in the Region for over 3 months, notwithstanding a spike in deaths observed during the week [25-31 Oct 2021], which was largely due to a backlog in the reporting of deaths from an area in India. The highest numbers of new cases were reported from India (82 236 new cases; 6.0 new cases per 100 000; a 16% decrease), Thailand (55 975 new cases; 80.2 new cases per 100 000; a 9% decrease), and Myanmar (6743 new cases; 12.4 new cases per 100 000; a 16% increase).

The highest numbers of new deaths were reported from India (2605 new deaths; <1 new death per 100 000; a 33% decrease), Thailand (459 new deaths; <1 new death per 100 000; a 2% increase), and Indonesia (140 new deaths; <1 new death per 100 000; a 30% decrease).

Western Pacific Region
