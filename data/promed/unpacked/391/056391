Regarding potential exposure pathways to _Cryptococcus gattii_ from
possible wood-related sources, wooden pallets (be they made from
eucalyptus or other tree species) are a valuable resource and are not
so cheap, thus many businesses will try to reuse them. Many counties
and states in the USA encourage reuse or recycling of wooden pallets,
especially counties with nearly full landfills. Those working under
an integrated solid waste management plan or construction/demolition
debris plan will actively encourage their reuse or recycling. Some
USA states, such as North Carolina, ban the disposal of wooden
pallets, and insist they be recycled or reused (see U Buehlmann et
al: Ban on landfilling of wooden pallets in North Carolina: an
assessment of recycling and industry capacity. Journal of Cleaner
Production 2009; 17: 271-275; available at
<http://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/pubs/jrnl/2009/nrs_2009_buehlmann_002.pdf>
and
<http://www.durhamcountync.gov/departments/gnsv/Solid_Waste_Division.html>).

Recycling wooden pallets is also a common business in the USA and
Canada. Some encourage one to start up one's own pallet recycling
business (see
<http://www.ehow.com/how_2078417_start-pallet-recycling-business.html>),
and there is an industry built around it (see
<http://www.recycle.net/Wood/pallet/index.html>), though pallets made
of recycled plastic are making a dent into the wooden pallet business.

One website (see
<http://lifehackery.com/2008/06/04/12-creative-ways-to-recycle-wooden-pallets/>)
mentions 12 ways that wooden pallets can be recycled, that is, 12
different theoretical exposure pathways for the average citizen (or
at least those citizens involved in reuse or recycling). This is in
addition to other mechanisms of environmental exposure like the wood
chips (which can be made from pallets) spread in the landscapes in
public parks mentioned by SE Kidd et al in their 2007 Emerg Infect
Dis article [_Cryptococcus gattii_ Dispersal Mechanisms, British
Columbia, Canada; available at <http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/13/1/51.htm>].

Other landscape-related exposures could include children's play areas
covered with wood chips or bark, and private residences using wood
chips for residential landscaping. One group at higher possible
exposure risk could be professional gardeners and landscapers, many
of whom handle and use large quantities of wood chips in the spring
and fall seasons.

Pets such as cats, which become ill with _C. gattii_ (see L
MacDougall et al: Spread of _Cryptococcus gattii_ in British
Columbia, Canada, and detection in the Pacific Northwest, USA. Emerg
Infect Dis 2007; 13(1): 42-50; available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/13/1/42.htm>) could be exposed to
recycled wood chips as they explore landscaped yards and use them as
toilet areas, and perhaps exposed to sawdust if mixed in with cat
litter. Cat litter usually contains special clays to absorb liquid or
moist waste (urine, feces) but sawdust is also a common component of
litter mixtures (see <http://www.worldwise.com/catboxlitter.html>)
and sawdust is sometimes marketed to cat owners who want a more
natural material for pet bodily functions. Sawdust is also used for
pet/companion bird litter (see for example
<http://www.luvlitters.com/birdie.htm>).

Additional uses of recycled wood (usually as sawdust) may be as
bedding or absorptive materials for poultry, horses, livestock, and
dairy cattle (coops, corrals, pens), perhaps accounting for some of
the exposure of domesticated animals to _C. gattii_. For example,
comparative studies of sawdust and straw to produce dairy waste
compost are discussed in
<http://www.cals.ncsu.edu/waste_mgt/natlcenter/sanantonio/Michel.pdf>
and commercial products for dairy cattle bedding (wood shavings and
sawdust) operations are on the market (see
<http://www.plattsanimalbedding.co.uk/cattle-products/>). Sawdust is
particularly common in commercial poultry bedding (see R Nodar et al:
Microbial populations of poultry pine-sawdust litter. Biological
Wastes 1990; 33(4): 295-306; abstract available at
<http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0269-7483(90)90133-D>). Sawdust is also
being used in certain horticultural operations (see
<http://www.tamu-commerce.edu/agscience/res-dlc/reports/tidwell.html>
and <http://mdc.mo.gov/forest/products/EverythingButTheSqueal/>),
including floriculture where it is used as part of mixes for organic
growing media and fertilizers for greenhouses (see
<http://www.umass.edu/umext/floriculture/fact_sheets/greenhouse_management/dc_organic_fert.html>).

Thus, if the epidemiological association between certain wood
products and _C. gattii_ is upheld, the commercial uses for wooden
pallets when transformed to wood chips, shavings, or sawdust may
represent potential exposure pathways for individuals handling these
products in the home and garden, backyard, or commercial poultry
houses, horse, livestock, and dairy operations, and some
horticultural and floriculture operations.
