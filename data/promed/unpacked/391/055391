Rare fungal infection raises concerns for doctors
---------------------------------------------------
Doctors are having trouble diagnosing a rare fungal infection among
people in northern Ontario. The acidic, moist soil in woodland areas
around Kenora makes it an ideal breeding ground for microscopic
fungal spores. When people breathe in the spores, it can make them
sick with blastomycosis. The spores reproduce in the lungs causing a
cough, skin lesions, or arthritis-like symptoms. "It would make you
vomit and actually bruise muscles in your back with the violent
coughing," said [the man], who got the cough after watching a work
crew dig up a pipe.
He wasn't cured until months later when he was correctly diagnosed
and received the proper antifungal medicine. Health officials said
since 1998, the spores may have sickened up to 50 people a year in
the area and are suspected in several deaths.
The prevalence of this disease in Canada is unknown, experts say, but
blastomycosis mimics many other diseases, which makes it difficult to
diagnosis. One of Kenora's experts doesn't like to admit it, but he
was sick for 9 weeks before he figured out what he had. "I probably
was a very good illustration of how insidious this disease can be, if
you don't think to ask the right question," said pathologist Dr.
Kerry MacDonald. No one knows how common blastomycosis is in Canada.
Doctors aren't required to notify the government when someone is
diagnosed. Some experts want that changed. They want blastomycosis
added to the list of diseases that doctors must report to public
health authorities. They also want research done to pinpoint which
people and regions are most vulnerable.
Changes to the environment, rainfall, and temperatures could make the
spores more common, according to spore-based disease specialist Dr.
John Embil. Since the spores can't be removed from the environment,
health officials say people should see a doctor when their symptoms
don't subside.

[Blastomycosis is a systemic fungal infection mainly found in the USA
and Canada, but with sporadic cases worldwide. The fungus may
occasionally be isolated from soil, and infection is through the
airways. Chronic pulmonary infections are the most common
presentation, but disseminated disease with infection of bones and
skin has been described. Antibody surveys have shown that subclinical
exposure is common in endemic areas. A cluster of 50 cases seems a
lot and indicates a high prevalence in the environment. - Mod.EP]
