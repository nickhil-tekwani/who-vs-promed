Health officials said 5 Kawasaki city zookeepers have been struck
down by a rare infectious disease. One of the Yumemigasaki Zoo
employees infected with brucellosis has been admitted to hospital,
suffering from pneumonia. The condition of the others does not
require hospitalization, the officials said.
The 5 were apparently infected while attending the delivery of a
moose on 27 May 2001 [presumably this means delivery of a baby
moose, which exposes those who are present to bacteria. Those
assisting in the birthing process may be exposed by bacteria splashing
into the nose, mouth or eyes or entering through other skin abrasions.

[The disease is transmitted between humans and animals and is often seen in
the Mediterranean region and Latin America.
Brucellosis victims suffer from fever, fatigue, a big drop in weight, and
depression. Fatalities are rare, but the disease can be dangerous if it
triggers endocarditis (inflammation of the lining of the heart).
The Kawasaki Municipal Government, which runs the zoo, reportedly decided
to shut down the facility to check the scale of the outbreak there. So far,
a goat in the zoo has been confirmed as being infected with the disease. -
