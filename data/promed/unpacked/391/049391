Authorities are confident the discovery of the cattle strain of Johnes
Disease in a sheep in Western Australia's (WA) southwest is an isolated
case. The disease causes chronic diarrhea and wasting. It can also cause
death. A property running 2000 sheep and 350 cattle has been quarantined
following the discovery.
The Department of Agriculture's Ashley Mercy says while WA has been
declared a "free zone" for Johnes Disease, they do expect some cases.
He says they are confident the disease has been contained. "The particular
property concerned sends all its sheep for slaughter, and all the cattle
for slaughter, so we've no reason to believe that this case has spread to
other properties at this stage," Mr Mercy said.
