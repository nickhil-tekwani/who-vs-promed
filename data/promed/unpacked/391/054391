The World Health Organization aimed a broadside at the Chinese
Ministry of Agriculture on Wed 1 Nov 2006, criticizing Chinese
officials for not informing the global community of the emergence of
a new variant [properly described as a sub-lineage - Mod.CP] of the
worrisome H5N1 avian flu virus, hoarding virus samples and for not
doing enough to contain the spread of H5N1 in poultry.
In an interview from Beijing, the WHO's top representative for China
also suggested the Ministry of Agriculture may be selectively
reporting findings of H5N1 in poultry, only alerting the world when
large outbreaks occur. "I think the interpretation here with the
Ministry of Agriculture is that they report major outbreaks. They
might not report if they find here and there a virus," Dr. Henk Bekedam said.
International regulations require that any finding of a highly
pathogenic avian influenza virus in domestic poultry -- and H5N1 is
definitely one -- must be reported to the World Organization for
Animal Health [OIE].
The critical comments -- from both Bekedam and Dr. Julie Hall, an
infectious diseases expert in WHO's China office -- were triggered by
the publication earlier this week of a scientific article outlining
the emergence of a new variant [sub-lineage] of the H5N1 virus. The
paper was published in the journal Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences [of the USA; see ProMED-mail post entitled Avian
influenza, human (170): new sub-lineage 20061031.3116. - Mod.CP].
The researchers said the new variant was first isolated in Fujian
province in March 2005 and since then has rapidly crowded out other
subgroups of H5N1 viruses in southern China, spreading as well to
Malaysia, Thailand, Hong Kong and Laos. It has triggered human cases
in China and Thailand.
The WHO officials were not pleased to learn about the Fujian-like
variant in the pages of a scientific journal. "It's so sad that we
haven't got that information or those viruses from the Ministry of
Agriculture and we have to rely on research groups in Hong Kong and
the United States to provide that information," Hall said.
She and Bekedam confirmed that virus samples the Ministry of
Agriculture promised to share with the world last March and which
China said were cleared for export in late September probably [?]
haven't yet left the country. "As far as we understand, as of 2 days
ago, the viruses have not physically left China," Bekedam said. The
laboratories that conduct influenza testing and surveillance for the
World Health Organization need sample viruses to track the
characteristics of the virus and to ensure that prototype human
vaccines are up to date.
Changes in viral characteristics can render old vaccine strains
ineffective, requiring newer versions to be made. The Ministry of
Agriculture hasn't shared any H5N1 virus samples with the global
community since June 2004, Hall said.
In contrast, China's Ministry of Health has been forthcoming, the WHO
officials said, sharing 5 virus samples over the last 12 months. One
of those sample viruses was used to make a seed strain for a human
vaccine the WHO thinks might be effective against the Fujian-like
strain. But without sample Fujian-like viruses to test, it cannot be
sure, Hall said.
Bekedam said the WHO is aware that the Ministry of Agriculture has
been conducting the kind of surveillance that was done by the authors
of the article. That suggests either the Ministry knew of the new
variant and didn't share the news with the global community, or its
surveillance isn't as thorough as it needs to be, he said. "This . .
. article very clearly says: if you really look for it,
systematically, you will find it," Bekedam said. "That is what is needed."
Bekedam said the journal article is also proof that China's efforts
to contain the virus need to be kicked up a notch. And he suggested
the country's poultry vaccine manufacturers should urgently update
the strains in their vaccines to include the Fujian-like virus -- if
they haven't already done so. "Obviously whatever's being done, the
control mechanisms which are put in place are not working and
definitely not working for this specific strain of the Fujian(-like)
virus" he said.
"And that might mean that the vaccine that they're using might not be
able to capture this. That could be one of the conclusions."

China has found no evidence of a new strain of H5N1 bird flu in its
southern provinces and said on Thu [2 Nov 2006] that there was no
need to share virus samples with the World Health Organisation (WHO).
Scientists in Hong Kong and the United States said in a report
released this week they had detected a new strain of bird flu, first
isolated in the southern Chinese province of Fujian last year, that
may have started outbreaks in Southeast Asia [see: Avian influenza,
human (170): new sub-lineage 20061031.3116] . But China rejected the
report, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences [of the USA], saying there was no evidence of major changes
to the virus since 2004.
"Up to now, the bird flu viruses selected from the south share a high
uniformity," Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao told a regular
news conference. "There has no marked change in the biological
characteristics of the organisms."
China, home to the world's biggest poultry population, has been at
the centre of the fight against bird flu, which scientists fear could
mutate into a form that can pass easily between people, potentially
leading to a pandemic. It has battled dozens of outbreaks in birds,
and seen at least 21 human cases, including 14 deaths. But the World
Health Organisation says its understanding of the virus and how it
might be changing is being hampered by the fact China has not shared
animal virus samples since 2004. "It's our understanding that there
have been certainly changes in the virus and continual evolution in
[i.e. of] the virus since 2004 and the viruses that we requested from
2005 have still not been shared with WHO," said Julie Hall, the WHO's
bird flu coordinator in Beijing.
The point was not whether there were major differences in virus
strains, she said: it was about being able to keep abreast of
changes, however minute, to better understand how the virus is
developing. "Whether it be dramatic or significant, it's about that
regular understanding so that we can see that we're keeping on top of
this," Hall said.
China was criticised for its initial cover-up of the SARS virus,
which first emerged in its southern province of Guangdong in 2003,
but the government has defended its handling of bird flu, saying it
has been promptly reporting outbreaks. Liu said China was maintaining
"close cooperative relations" with the WHO and the U.N. Food and
Agriculture Organisation in dealing with H5N1.
