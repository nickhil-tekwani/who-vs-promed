According to this report, 69 bovines that had died from tetanus at a ranch
in Rio Grande do Sul were disposed of by incineration. An additional 196
bovines at another ranch were also disposed of by incineration last week.
The animals began to die 37 days ago. According to the administrator of the
ranches, Julio Echeverria, 6 bovines at one of the ranches are ill with
tetanus and are under treatment with penicillin. Experts at the Federal
University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS) released information at the
beginning of the month that confirmed the presence of the tetanus bacteria
in vials of an injectable vermicide. The Ministry [of Agriculture sent
specimens of the product from the market to the official experts at the
Animal Reference Laboratory (Lara) to study the causes of the disease.

[In the last posting, it was speculated but not confirmed that the product
was an injectable product. This report confirms this as the cause of a
rather large tetanus outbreak; interesting, as bovine tetanus is rarely
reported. Unless there are any new developments, this thread will be cut. -
