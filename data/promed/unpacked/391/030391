Outbreak in Guinea Bissau (Mansoa) - Not Hemorrhagic Fever
-------------------------------------------------------------------
An investigation conducted by the Ministry of Health and the Institut
Pasteur of Dakar, with the assistance of WHO and the French
Cooperation, dismissed the diagnosis of haemorrhagic fever as the
cause of the outbreak which took place recently in Mansoa, in Guinea
Bissau.
Mansoa is a city of 25 000 inhabitants located 60 km north-east of
Bissau City. According to our results, a total of 82 clinical cases
of measles were admitted in the local Health Centre between the end
of April and 14 Jun 2003. The sex-ratio was 1.1; median age was 3
years (2 months to 29 years); under 5 years old, 5-14 years old and
adult patients were respectively 59.8%, 24.1% and 16.1%;
case-fatality ratio was zero. The measles immunization coverage was
estimated to be less than 60%. Anti-measles IgM [antibodies] were
detected in 7 out of 8 blood samples taken from patients and [tested
at] the Institut Pasteur.
Other patients had fever, [elevated bilirubin], proteinuria and
microscopic haematuria; one of them died with signs of bloody
diarrhoea. Blood samples were taken from eight of them and tested
negative for haemorrhagic fever viruses (Yellow fever, West Nile,
Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever, Dengue 2, Rift Valley fever,
Chikungunya, and Lassa fever viruses). Samples were sent to the
Institut Pasteur in Lyon for confirmation. Malaria was the most
probable diagnosis but biological analyses to confirm the diagnosis
were not carried out. However, all the patients recovered with
anti-malarial treatment (chloroquine) and antibiotics.
The following recommendations were implemented; (i) to assess and
reinforce [measles] immunization coverage, (ii) to improve the
surveillance systems, and (iii) to evaluate the risk of haemorrhagic
fever emergence in this area with ecological conditions very similar
to those of Guinea, western Cote d'Ivoire and Liberia where
circulation of Yellow fever virus, Lassa fever virus and Ebola virus
has been documented.
