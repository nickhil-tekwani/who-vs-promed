Alligator Farming in Idaho
--------------------------
In response to the recent posting by Steve Grenard, I would like to clarify
the information about alligators in Idaho. The farm in question has raised
alligators for the meat and hide trade for many years. This is possible
due to the artesian wells on the property. The water from the wells is over
90 degrees F. These alligators are raised in enclosed locked barns.
The owner of the farm has been very responsible and has been in touch with
some well-known researchers in Louisiana and Florida during this
incident. He initiated the testing that led to a diagnosis and agreed to
destroy the remaining 600 alligators. He has completed disinfection of the
barn.
Investigators from South Central District Health have been on site at the
farm and provided the testing and interview of the workers. The worker with
a positive West Nile antibody test had completed necropsies of alligators
during the early period when the cause of the alligator die-off was not
known. This worker had minimal symptoms that were not recognized at the
time. Idaho health districts trapped mosquitoes during the summer season
with no mosquitoes found to be positive for West Nile virus. Trapping was
completed within 10 miles of the farm. We will continue to trap mosquitoes
in the area of the farm next spring.
This incident should prompt us to look for unusual situations that provide
an avenue for the introduction of emerging infectious diseases.

Alligator Farming and Diagnosis of West Nile Virus Infection
--------------------------------------------------
I would like to clarify the comments about West Nile virus (WNV) in Idaho.
There is indeed a commercial alligator (_Alligator mississippiensis_) ranch
in Idaho. This ranch obtained hatchling (approx. 1 month old) alligators
from a farm in Florida. Since Idaho was a "WNV-free" state we believe these
animals were infected in Florida prior to shipment. However this will
become more clear as we learn more about the incubation period of WNV in
alligators.
These animals are not intended for the pet trade, as was suggested. If
anything, the spectacled caiman (_Caiman crocodilus_) is a more popular
species because of their smaller size. Crocodilian species represent only a
small fraction of reptiles in the pet trade, and we encourage people not to
keep them as pets. This is a commercial operation that raises them to
market size for the hide and meat markets.
Clinical signs in these animals were similar to those observed in other
cases of WNV in Louisiana and Florida. These include swimming in circles,
head tilt, muscle tremors, and anorexia as evidenced by lack of ingesta and
digesta on necropsy. Mortalities were near 40 percent. A total of 8 animals
were tested at LSU from this particular ranch in Idaho. All 8 were positive
for WNV via RT-PCR and virus culture.
The owner of the ranch acted in a very responsible manner by contacting the
local agricultural and health agencies upon the diagnosis. Depopulation of
the affected building was recommended, and to the best of my knowledge this
was performed. This recommendation was made based on the WNV status of
Idaho and it is not recommended in states were WNV is already present.
In Louisiana we have distributed educational information concerning WNV and
prevention methods to all alligator farmers/ranchers. The zoonotic
potential appears to be real, since we suspect that alligators can get high
viremias and shed the virus in the feces. However this is all ongoing work
that has not been published. The human population at risk as are those
alligator ranchers/farmers and their workers. They have all been made aware
of the situation. We have combined the efforts of veterinarians, wild-life
biologists, state health officials, and mosquito control agencies to
address this issue at the alligator farms.
If there are any more questions, I urge you to contact those of us who have
been actively involved in the diagnosis of WNV in alligators. This has been
done in Louisiana, Florida, and Georgia. It is important that we present
facts and not speculations that may negatively affect the reptile and
alligator industry. We are well aware of the concerns towards human
health, but this industry also represents the livelihood of many individuals.

We actually do have a licensed alligator farm in Idaho. They are raised in
closed houses in geothermal water on a tilapia and catfish farm, also
raised in geothermal water. The alligators are imported to Idaho as
hatchlings from Florida and are used as a waste disposal system for the
fish farm and fish processing plant disposing of morts and offal. They are
raised to about 3 to 4 feet then processed for their hides and meat. They
were legally imported with permits from USFWS, Idaho State Department of
Agriculture, and Idaho Fish and Game.

Re: Alligator Farming in Idaho And West Nile Virus
--------------------------------------------------
Alligator farming does occur in Idaho with the aid of geothermal waters and
enclosed structures. It has gone on for many years. These animals are not
part of the pet trade. These animals are raised for hides and meat just
like those produced in more temperate states.
Cloacal swabs and tissue swabs yielded positive real-time RT-PCR results
from these imported hatchlings confirming West Nile virus (WNV) in this
group. The individual who had seroconverted did have an extraordinary
exposure while carrying out a necropsy in the absence of personal
protection, strongly suggesting a direct blood-borne exposure. None of the
handlers that dealt with daily operations seroconverted.
We have been doing extensive surveillance for WNV in Idaho (mosquito,
avian, equine, and human) for 2 years now, and with the exception of
several imported human and equine cases, have not found any evidence of WNV
within our borders. We attempted to collect mosquitoes around the alligator
farm; however, temperatures had dropped and no mosquitoes were found in the
collection traps.
There is much to be learned from WNV-infected alligators. I believe that
studies are ongoing in other states to more clearly elucidate the biology
of this virus in these animals. Perhaps then scientists will more clearly
understand the risks associated with animals that might make it into the
pet trade.
It is important to realize that these animals do apparently shed virus
fecally, as was proven by our positive cloacal swabs. They also clearly
have virus in their tissues, so it would be prudent to handle them
accordingly and presume that a risk is present.
