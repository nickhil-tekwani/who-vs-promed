DNA test results and other evidence have now established that an
outbreak of illness involving at least 35 people, the majority
children and teens, was linked to drinking unpasteurized milk.
Wisconsin food safety officials are cautioning consumers not to drink
raw milk and farmers not to sell it to the public.

"Laws requiring pasteurization of milk have been on the books for more
than half a century, and there are good public health reasons for
that," said Steve Ingham, head of the Food Safety Division in the
Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection [DATCP].

"We have very compelling evidence linking these illnesses to drinking
raw milk. This is the 3rd major outbreak in Wisconsin since 2001 that
has been tied to raw milk consumption. That's not to mention a number
of smaller ones in which the link was strongly suspected, but patients
were unwilling to identify farms that provided the milk. So far we've
been fortunate that the infections have not been life-threatening, but
raw milk is an inherently risky food and it can lead to other, more
dangerous illnesses, including _E. coli_ 0157:H7 infection."

An epidemiologic investigation conducted by DATCP and the Wisconsin
Department of Health Services has found 35 confirmed cases of
_Campylobacter jejuni_ infection, including 21 patients under age 18.
One person was hospitalized. All the patients had consumed
unpasteurized milk. 30 of the patients identified Zinniker Family
Farm, Elkhorn, as the source of the raw milk. The farm sells raw milk
through a "cow-share" program. 27 of the confirmed cases were in
Walworth and Waukesha counties; the rest were in Racine and Kenosha
counties.

Additional testing showed that the _C. jejuni_ isolated from 25 of the
patients, all linked to Zinniker Family Farm, had the same DNA
fingerprint. Manure samples obtained directly from milking cows on
that farm also tested positive for _C. jejuni_ with the same DNA
fingerprint. Manure on the cows' udders or in the milking barn
environment can contaminate milk. Pasteurization kills _C. jejuni_ and
other disease-causing bacteria in milk.

_C. jejuni_ is a bacterium that causes symptoms including diarrhea,
abdominal cramping, fever, nausea and vomiting. Rarely, an infection
may lead to Guillain-Barre syndrome, a nervous system disease, which
may require hospitalization and artificial respiration. This generally
occurs after the initial symptoms have disappeared. The infection can
be transmitted by consuming food contaminated by animal feces or
handled by someone with the infection who has not adequately washed
his/her hands after using the bathroom.

Milk samples from the farm taken after the initial outbreak did not
test positive, which is not unusual, Ingham said. Cattle shed the
bacteria intermittently, so the bacteria may not have been present
when the samples were taken. Changes in sanitation procedures could
also explain the absence of bacteria in later milk samples, he said.

Because Zinniker Family Farm sells milk to a defined customer list,
there is little risk to the general public in this case. However, the
outbreak should discourage consumers from joining "cow-share,"
membership, or other similar arrangements to buy raw milk, and should
discourage dairy producers from adopting such an arrangement for their
farms, Ingham said.

"Selling raw milk to consumers is illegal in Wisconsin. Some farmers
believe that such arrangements exempt them from the law. They are
mistaken. The law says that owners may consume raw milk from their
farms, but those owners have to be true owners with a real financial
stake in the farm. And the law clearly says that unpasteurized milk
can be sold only to a licensed dairy plant or to other licensed
businesses that sell to dairy plants," he said.

Other outbreaks in Wisconsin that have been tied to raw milk include:
- in December 2001, at least 30 laboratory-confirmed cases of _C.
jejuni_ were identified in northwestern Wisconsin, all tied to a
cow-share program;
- in June 2006, 19 laboratory-confirmed and 39 probable cases of _C.
jejuni_ infection were traced to cheese curds made from unpasteurized
milk in an unlicensed facility by an unlicensed cheese maker in
Ashland. The cases occurred in many Wisconsin counties and 6 other
states.

Nationwide, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that
45 outbreaks tied to unpasteurized milk or cheese consumption occurred
from 1998 to 2005. These outbreaks occurred in 22 states, 2 were
multi-state outbreaks, and they resulted in 1000 illnesses, 104
hospitalizations, and 2 deaths.

In an article published in the Wisconsin Medical Journal in August
2000, the Wisconsin Division of Public Health reported that from 1992
to 1999, consumption of raw milk and raw milk products was one of the
top 3 risks for _E. coli_ 0157:H7 infection in Wisconsin. _E. coli_
0157:H7 infections can be fatal.

Regarding whether raw milk safety and its increased nutritional value
has been "adequately documented by both the USDA and the FDA, the
following is from the FDA in 2004, "Got Milk? Make Sure It's
Pasteurized":

"Pasteurization, since its adoption in the early 1900s, has been
credited with dramatically reducing illness and death caused by
contaminated milk. But today, some people are passing up pasteurized
milk for what they claim is tastier and healthier "raw milk." Public
health officials couldn't disagree more.

Drinking raw (untreated) milk or eating raw milk products is "like
playing Russian roulette with your health," says John Sheehan,
director of the Food and Drug Administration's Division of Dairy and
Egg Safety. "We see a number of cases of foodborne illness every year
related to the consumption of raw milk."

More than 300 people in the USA got sick from drinking raw milk or
eating cheese made from raw milk in 2001, and nearly 200 became ill
from these products in 2002, according to the CDC.

Raw milk may harbor a host of disease-causing organisms (pathogens),
such as the bacteria _Campylobacter_, _E. coli_, _Listeria_,
_Salmonella_, _Yersinia_, and _Brucella_. Common symptoms of foodborne
illness from many of these types of bacteria include diarrhea, stomach
cramps, fever, headache, vomiting, and exhaustion. Most healthy people
recover from foodborne illness within a short period of time, but
others may have symptoms that are chronic, severe, or life-threatening.

People with weakened immune systems, such as elderly people, children,
and those with certain diseases or conditions, are most at risk for
severe infections from pathogens that may be present in raw milk. In
pregnant women, _Listeria monocytogenes_-caused illness can result in
miscarriage, fetal death, or illness or death of a newborn infant. And
_E. coli_ infection has been linked to hemolytic uremic syndrome, a
condition that can cause kidney failure and death.

Some of the diseases that pasteurization can prevent are tuberculosis,
diphtheria, polio, salmonellosis, strep throat, scarlet fever, and
typhoid fever.

Pasteurization and contamination
--------------------------------
The pasteurization process uses heat to destroy harmful bacteria
without significantly changing milk's nutritional value or flavor. In
addition to killing disease-causing bacteria, pasteurization destroys
bacteria that cause spoilage, extending the shelf life of milk.

Milk can become contaminated on the farm when animals shed bacteria
into the milk. Cows, goats, and sheep carry bacteria in their
intestines that do not make them sick but can cause illness in people
who consume their untreated milk or milk products.

But pathogens that are shed from animals aren't the only means of
contamination, says Tom Szalkucki, assistant director of the Wisconsin
Center for Dairy Research at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Cows
can pick up pathogens from the environment just by lying down, giving
germs the opportunity to collect on the udder, the organ from which
milk is secreted. "Think about how many times a cow lays down in a
field or the barn," says Szalkucki. "Even if the barn is cleaned
thoroughly and regularly, it's not steamed. Contamination can take
place because it's not a sterile environment."

The health hype
---------------
Raw milk advocates claim that unprocessed milk is healthier because
pasteurization destroys nutrients and the enzymes necessary to absorb
calcium. It also kills beneficial bacteria and is associated with
allergies, arthritis, and other diseases, they say.

This is simply not the case, says Sheehan. Research has shown that
there is no significant difference in the nutritional value of
pasteurized and unpasteurized milk, he says. The caseins, the major
family of milk proteins, are largely unaffected, and any modification
in whey protein that might occur is barely perceptible.

"Milk is a good source of the vitamins thiamine, folate, B-12, and
riboflavin," adds Sheehan, "and pasteurization results in losses of
anywhere from zero to 10 percent for each of these, which most would
consider only a marginal reduction."

While the major nutrients are left unchanged by pasteurization,
vitamin D, which enhances the body's absorption of calcium, is added
to processed milk. Vitamin D is not found in significant levels in raw
milk.

"Pasteurization will destroy some enzymes," says Barbara Ingham, PhD,
associate professor, and extension food scientist at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison. "But the enzymes that are naturally present in milk
are bovine enzymes. Our bodies don't use animal enzymes to help
metabolize calcium and other nutrients."

"Enzymes in the food that we eat and drink are broken down in the
human gastrointestinal tract," adds Ingham. "Human bodies rely on our
own native enzymes to digest and metabolize food."

"Most of the native enzymes of milk survive pasteurization largely
intact," says Sheehan, "including those thought to have natural
antimicrobial properties and those that contribute to prolonging
milk's shelf life." Other enzymes that survive are thought to play a
role in cheese ripening.

Ingham says that pasteurization will destroy some bacteria that may be
helpful in the fermentation of milk into products such as cheese and
yogurt, "but the benefit of destroying the harmful bacteria vastly
outweighs the supposed benefits of retaining those helpful
microorganisms. Plus, by adding the microorganisms that we need for
fermentation, we can assure a consistently high quality product."

Science has not shown a connection between drinking raw milk and
disease prevention. "The small quantities of antibodies in milk are
not absorbed in the human intestinal tract," says Ingham. "And there
is no scientific evidence that raw milk contains an anti-arthritis
factor or that it enhances resistance to other diseases."

Fans of raw milk often cite its creamy rich taste, says Szalkucki, who
adds that it may be creamier because it is not made according to the
standards for processed milk. "If you go to a grocery store and buy
fluid milk, it's been standardized for a certain percentage of fat,
such as 2 percent," he says. "Raw milk is potentially creamier because
it has not been standardized and it has a higher fat content."

The law
-------
It is a violation of federal law enforced by the FDA to sell raw milk
packaged for consumer use across state lines (interstate commerce).
But each state regulates the sale of raw milk within the state
(intrastate), and some states allow it to be sold. This means that in
some states, dairy operations may sell it to local retail food stores
or to consumers directly from the farm or at agricultural fairs or
other community events, depending on the state law.

In states that prohibit intrastate sales of raw milk, some people have
tried to circumvent the law by "cow sharing," or "cow leasing." They
pay a fee to a farmer to lease or purchase part of a cow in exchange
for raw milk, claiming that they are not actually buying the milk
since they are part-owners of the cow. Wisconsin banned cow-leasing
programs after 75 people became infected with _Campylobacter jejuni_
bacteria in 2001 from drinking unpasteurized milk obtained through
such a program.

Raw milk cheeses
----------------
The FDA allows the manufacture and interstate sale of raw milk cheeses
that are aged for at least 60 days at a temperature not less than 35
deg F (2 deg C). "However, recent research calls into question the
effectiveness of 60-day aging as a means of pathogen reduction," says
Sheehan.

The FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) is
currently examining the safety of raw milk cheeses and plans to
develop a risk profile for these cheeses. This information will help
FDA risk managers make future decisions regarding the regulation of
these products to protect public health.

Ensuring milk safety
--------------------
The FDA provides oversight for the processing of raw milk into
pasteurized milk, cottage cheese, yogurt, and sour cream under the
National Conference on Interstate Milk Shipments "Grade A" milk
program. This cooperative program between the FDA and the 50 states
and Puerto Rico helps to ensure the uniformity of milk regulations and
the safety of milk and milk products. The program is based on
standards described in the FDA's Pasteurized Milk Ordinance (PMO), a
model code of regulations that can be adopted by the states in their
own regulations.

Under the Grade A program, state personnel conduct inspections and
assign ratings, and FDA regional milk specialists audit these ratings,
says Richard Eubanks, MPH, a senior milk sanitation officer on CFSAN's
Milk Safety Team. "It's a rigorous process of inspection and
auditing," he says, and "it covers from cow to carton," starting with
the dairy farm and continuing through the processing and packaging of
products at milk plants. Products that pass inspection may be labeled
"Grade A."

The FDA Grade A milk program includes pasteurized milk from cows,
goats, sheep, and horses. Raw milk and raw milk cheeses cannot be
labeled Grade A, since they are not pasteurized and not covered under
the program.

A sampling of raw milk incidents
--------------------------------
July 2004 -- the Indiana Public Health Department advised consumers to
check their refrigerators and freezers for raw milk cheese that might
be contaminated with salmonella. Routine product sampling found the
bacteria in lot number 139 of "Natural Raw Milk Cheese" made by Meadow
Valley Farm after the cheese was distributed to farmers' markets and
specialty food stores in parts of Indiana and Wisconsin.

2002-2003 -- Two children were hospitalized in Ohio for infection with
_Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhimurium. These children and 60
other people in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and Tennessee developed
bloody diarrhea, cramps, fever, chills, and vomiting from _S._
Typhimurium tracked to consuming raw milk. The milk producer
voluntarily relinquished its license for selling raw milk upon
recommendation of the Ohio Department of Agriculture.

2000-2001 -- in North Carolina, 12 adults were infected with _Listeria
monocytogenes_ linked to homemade, Mexican-style fresh soft cheese
produced from contaminated raw milk sold by a local dairy farm. 10 of
the 12 victims were pregnant women, and infection with the bacterium
resulted in 5 stillbirths, 3 premature deliveries, and 2 infected
newborns.

1998 -- in Massachusetts, 66 people received injections to protect
against potential exposure to rabies after drinking unpasteurized milk
from a local dairy. A cow that died at the dairy was found to be
infected with rabies. Transmission of the rabies virus through
unpasteurized milk, although not the common route of infection, is
theoretically possible, according to the CDC." - Mod.LL]
