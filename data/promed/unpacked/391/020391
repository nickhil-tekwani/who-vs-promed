****"This is the first outbreak of measles in Greece since 1996."****

Since November 2005, there has been an outbreak of measles in Greece.
Sporadic cases began to appear in September 2005. Between 1 Sep 2005
and 12 Feb 2006, 171 cases of measles were reported, of which 53 (31
percent) have been laboratory confirmed (by detection of measles
IgM), 99 (58 percent) are probable cases (clinical criteria according
to case definition [1]), and 19 (11 percent) are still awaiting
laboratory confirmation [A histogram in the original text records the
occurrence of notified cases of measles by week of symptom onset
from1 Sep 2005 to 12 Feb 2006.]
Cases were reported from 14 of the 52 districts of Greece [the
geographic locations are illustrated by a text figure in the original
article], and 159/171 patients (93 percent) are from northern Greece.
88 cases (52 percent) are in males. About half (45 percent) of the
patients are aged 0-4 years, 16 percent are aged 5-9 years, 15
percent are aged 10-19; and 25 percent are aged 20 or older, most of
these being young adults.
94 patients (55 percent) belong to Roma (gypsy) families and 25 (15
percent) to immigrant families; 52 cases (30 percent) belong to the
non-minority general population, most of whom (71 percent) are 15
years old or more. Of 110 patients with known vaccination status, 98
(89 percent) were unvaccinated for measles and 12 (11 percent) had
received one dose of measles-containing vaccine. 8 cases made up 2
hospital clusters (4 cases in each). 103 patients (60 percent) were
admitted to hospital, and 27 (16 percent) had complications (mainly
pneumonia and bronchiolitis), all of whom have recovered. Results of
virus isolation and molecular typing, which are being carried out at
the Hellenic Pasteur Institute, are pending.
Measles is a notifiable disease in Greece, and is under surveillance
through a sentinel physician system with both private and public
sector physicians. In both systems the EU case definition is used
(1). Laboratory surveillance of the disease is carried out through
the national reference laboratory for measles in Greece (Medical
Microbiology Laboratory, Hellenic Pasteur Institute).
Measures taken to control the outbreak include:
(a) Campaigns to vaccinate children between 0-14 years old in Roma
communities (estimated total population in Greece, 200 000) with MMR
in affected districts as a priority (carried out since December
2005), and in the whole country subsequently;
(b) recommendations to start vaccination of all infants at the age of
6 months in affected districts;
(c) alerting physicians and the general public to the need for all
children, adolescents and high-risk young adults to be vaccinated
with 2 doses of measles-containing vaccine;
(d) asking health professionals to enhance surveillance, and be aware
of vaccination requirements and prophylactic measures in healthcare
settings.
Discussion
----------
Measles vaccination was introduced in Greece in the early 1970s, when
vaccines became commercially available, and vaccination at the age of
15 months was introduced in the national immunisation schedule in
1981; measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR) was introduced in 1989.
Vaccination with a second dose of MMR at the age of 11-12 years was
introduced in the national immunisation schedule in 1991, and in 1999
this dose was shifted to 4-6 years.
According to several local studies carried out in 2003-2005 in
different parts of Greece, vaccination coverage of preschool
children, schoolchildren and adolescents with one dose of measles
containing vaccine is over 95 percent in the non-minority population,
and 80-90 percent in children of immigrant families. Vaccination
coverage with 2 doses is about 60-80 percent for the general child
population (2). Older studies have shown that cohorts of young adults
have much lower vaccination coverage , because over 9 years ago,
vaccination was not as widespread as today -- cohort effect,
particularly with 2 doses of measles-containing vaccine (86 percent
and 37 percent of 14-year-olds in a national study conducted in 1997
were vaccinated with one and 2 doses respectively) (3).
Vaccination coverage of Roma children has been found to be very low
(2-12 percent in studies of the period 2003-2005) (2), and although a
number of vaccination campaigns have taken place in this group since
these studies were made, vaccination coverage probably still remains
very low.
Overall, measles incidence has been steadily declining in Greece
during the past 25 years. The current outbreak is the first observed
in Greece since 1996. The 1996 outbreak was much smaller than
previous outbreaks, and after it ended the 2-5 year epidemic cycles
[were no longer observed]. [Illustrated by a figure in the text.]
Conclusions
------------
This is the first outbreak of m
easles in Greece since 1996. It has mainly affected 3 groups of the
population: the majority of patients are unvaccinated Roma children aged 0-14
years, primarily of preschool age. The 2nd group is older teenagers and young
adults from the non-minority general population who were either unvaccinated
or had received [only] one dose of measles-containing vaccine. Unvaccinated or
incompletely vaccinated immigrants, without any particular age pattern, are
the 3rd group affected. The large majority of cases occurred in northern
Greece.
