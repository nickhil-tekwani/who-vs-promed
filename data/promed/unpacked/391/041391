UK in grip of measles outbreak; Health experts are blaming low uptake
of the MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] vaccine
-----------------------------------------------
Numbers of measles cases in the UK have risen to their highest level
in nearly 20 years, experts said.
Surrey and Sussex could have up to 156 cases, and South Yorkshire may
have 180. Last year [2005], there were just 77 cases across England and Wales.
The southeast's health agency blames low uptake of the MMR vaccine.
It comes as a doctor who linked MMR with autism faces possible
misconduct charges.
A boy's death from the disease in April [2006] was the 1st UK
fatality in 14 years.
The Surrey and Sussex Health Protection Agency (HPA) said there had
been 106 confirmed cases in the 2 counties, with 50 more unconfirmed.
In Doncaster alone, there have been 100 reported cases, with as many
as 80 further cases elsewhere in South Yorkshire.
Dr. Peter English, consultant at the HPA, said: "We haven't had an
outbreak as big as this in this country since the MMR jab was
introduced in 1988."
He said the outbreak was not a surprise, as low MMR uptake had left
"a lot of people now susceptible to the disease."
Parents have been warned the highly-contagious disease could bring on
breathing difficulties, diarrhea, ear, lung and eye infections and
even swelling of the brain.
Dr. English, urging parents to ensure their children have the initial
vaccine and the booster jab, said without fast action there could be
an outbreak similar to that in Dublin in 2000, when 2 children died
and hundreds were hospitalized.
Earlier this week, it was revealed that Dr. Andrew Wakefield, the
doctor who 1st suggested a link between the MMR vaccine and autism,
could be charged with serious professional misconduct.

[In the earlier ProMED-mail reports on the measles outbreak in the
UK, travelers communities were identified as the primary source of
the measles cases (see ProMED-mail postings below). This moderator
was not able to find an official report on the UK Health Protection
Agency website giving an update on the measles activity as reported
in the above BBC newswire. Information from knowledgeable sources
would be greatly appreciated.
With respect to the last paragraph of the above newswire, there have
been extensive reviews of the data on possible association of autism
with a variety of vaccines, MMR, and other thimerosol containing
vaccines. A report of the Institute of Medicine, dated 17 May 2004
states: "The committee concludes that the body of epidemiological
evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between the MMR
vaccine and autism. The committee also concludes that the body of
epidemiological evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship
between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism. The committee
further finds that potential biological mechanisms for
vaccine-induced autism that have been generated to date are
theoretical only." (see <http://www.iom.edu/?id=20155&redirect=0>.
In Smeeth L, Cook C, Fombonne E, Heavey L, Rodrigues LC, Smith PG,
Hall AJ. MMR vaccination and pervasive developmental disorders: a
case-control study. Lancet. 2004 Sep 11-17;364(9438):963-9., the
authors concluded "Our findings suggest that MMR vaccination is not
associated with an increased risk of pervasive developmental disorders."
A good presentation of the body of evidence supporting the conclusion
that there is no association between MMR and autism can be found on
the Institute for Vaccine Safety of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of
Public Health website at <http://www.vaccinesafety.edu/cc-mmr.htm>. - Mod.MPP]
