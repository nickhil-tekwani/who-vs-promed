Peter Johnson, a Ministry of Agriculture crop specialist, says
farmers are counting on warm temperatures and dry weather before the
1st seeds are planted, which could be as early as this week or as
late as the beginning of June [2008].

"There's no question that we have some snow mould in some early
planted wheat and that's a disease that, the longer it's under snow,
the worse the disease gets, but in the fields that I've looked at, it
looks like most of the plants are still alive," he says.

It's too early to tell if disease or insects will be a problem. White
grubs are already making their presence known in larger fields and
Johnson says the pests can be quite damaging. Additionally, snow
mould is at higher levels this year [2008] than in the past decade
due to a continuous snow cover over the winter. "We're not out of the
woods by any means," he says.

[2] Leaf rust - USA (Kansas)

Leaf rust has made its 1st appearance in Kansas this year [2008]. The
wheat disease was recently detected in Riley and Barber counties.
K-State Research and Extension plant pathologist Erick DeWolf says
recent rains could trigger more outbreaks. Producers that have
planted Jagger, Jagalene, or Overley, the 3 top wheat varieties in
Kansas, should be especially vigilant.

DeWolf says if producers think they might want to apply a fungicide,
they should start crunching the numbers now. "Those most effective
fungicides are applied between flag leaf emergence up to flowering,
when most of the fungicides we have labels for here in Kansas, would
cut out," he said.

[Snow molds of wheat include several fungal species. Pink snow mold
is caused by _Monographella nivalis_ var. _nivalis_. It attacks
plants during wet, cool weather, but is not dependent on snow and can
also cause seedling and head blights of cereals. Pink snow mold
produces masses of microscopic spores on pink growth. Speckled snow
mold is caused by several _Typhula_ species, some of which are
restricted to areas with prolonged deep snow cover. Speckled snow
mold is grey-white and affected plants tend to bleach and shatter
easily. The speckling is due to dark sclerotia (fungal bodies) and
may or may not be present.

The snow molds survive in dead leaves of affected plants, or as
sclerotia in soil, and generally affect a number of cereal and grass
hosts. The pathogens are most aggressive at low temperatures.
Symptoms are most apparent in early spring when the snow first melts.
Plant vigour may be markedly reduced, and in severe cases, the crowns
are killed. Surviving plants recover slowly and are sensitive to
additional stresses. Disease management includes cultural practices,
fungicide applications, and the use of host cultivars suitable to the
region, which also have increased levels of resistance or tolerance
to the snow molds.

Leaf rust, also called brown rust, on wheat is caused by the fungus
_Puccinia recondita_. It reduces the photosynthetic potential of the
plant and can cause serious yield losses. Symptoms include brick-red
pustules on leaves, stems, and later on heads. As the crop ripens,
black spores are produced. The fungus overwinters on volunteer wheat,
barley, and certain wild grasses and is spread by wind, mechanical
means, and with contaminated plant material. Disease management
relies mainly on timely fungicide applications and choice of crop
cultivars.
