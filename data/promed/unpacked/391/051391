Medical investigations have revealed that 6 persons are suffering from
chikungunya in Kadaba and surrounding areas. They suffer from high
fever, body and joint aches and red patches all over the body and are
under treatment in government and private hospitals.

Medical officers and health assistants from primary health centres are
treating those affected by chikungunya in 8 neighboring areas and
other areas which come under the jurisdiction of Kadaba.

A few poor laborers who have recovered from chikungunya are not yet
able to go back to their daily tasks. In some households, the entire
family has been affected by the disease. The political parties also
feel the crunch of a shortage of campaigners for the forthcoming
assembly polls, owing to widespread disease in the surrounding areas.

[2] Sri Lanka (Sabaragamuwa): Request for Information

There have been 1296 cases of common fever detected in the country,
according to a survey conducted by the Regional Director of Health
Services (RDHS) in 8 villages in 3 districts.

The blood samples obtained from fever patients have been sent to the
MRI [Medical Research Institute?] in Borella for testing to ascertain
the exact illness, as the symptoms were very similar to those of
chikungunya, Deputy
Director, Health Services Dr. Athula Dangalle told the Daily Mirror.

However, there had been a sharp increase in common fever cases
reported in Rassagala and Balangoda. By 1 May [2008], there had been
1296 cases of common fever detected through a survey conducted by the
RDHS office carried out in 8 villages in 3 AGA divisions, he said.
The spread of common fever is on the rise in the Ratnapura District
due to incessant rains, while the prevalence of chikungunya has
receded to some extent, health authorities in the district said
yesterday [2 May 2008].

"There was a sharp increase of chikungunya during the last week of
April [2008], with 101 positive cases reported from Kuruwita,
Kiriella and Eheliyagoda out of 1900 hospital admissions in 37
hospitals in the district. The hospital admissions have now come down
to around 1000," Deputy Director, Health Services Dr. Athula Dangalle
told Daily Mirror yesterday [2 May 2008].

He said an awareness program targeting school children in addition to
a house to house education program has been launched to draw the
attention of the public to the necessity to keep their environment
free of vector borne diseases and about how to destroy mosquito
breeding places, Dr. Dangalle said. "Vector borne disease cannot be
controlled without the assistance of the public. They must keep their
environment clean and tidy at all times and prevent mosquito breeding
in their households and the neighborhood," he stressed.

[The ProMED 29 Apr 2008 post (archive no. 20080429) indicated that
over 2000 families had chikungunya. With the information provided in
the above report, it is difficult to know whether the common fever
cases mentioned above are in fact chikungunya virus infections.
ProMED will be interested in the results of the laboratory tests and
whether they confirm (or not) chikungunya virus infection. If they do
confirm it, this is a continuation of a major outbreak in the area.

The Ratnapura District is located in the Sabaragamuwa Province of Sri
Lanka; a map can be accessed at
