From: Hal Nash <hnash@wyoming.com>

A few years ago, the suggestion was made to slaughter the entire Wood Bison
National Park herd in an effort to accomplish two things: to eliminate
brucellosis (and probably BTB also) and to re-establish a "pure" wood bison
herd (since the current one is an amalgamation of wood and plains bison)
free of brucellosis and BTB. Back then, as well as now, I plead for the
operation of evolution and the survival of the fittest to do the natural
culling of this herd. I think the comment made in this post regarding the
wolf predation should be supported (if not enhanced) to bring about a
healthy bison herd.
If national parks are indeed established to preserve areas in their
"natural state", then let them alone. That includes the microbial portion
of the "natural state."
I realize that brucellosis was introduced into this continent from Europe.
As for the BTB, my guess is the same. I'll take a correction on that. But
for humans to mess with it now is the classic example of the arrogance
western philosophy perpetuates in its attitude toward nature.

[I have copied this to Cormack Gates & Brett Elkins, in case they should
wish to comment. As an outsider, who has spent only a short week in the NWT
and is therefore a complete "expert" on the subject, the problem as
explained to me was not that the WBNP bison herds were chronically
infected, but that there is the risk of these infections overflowing into
clean WB herds that were being established at great cost in the NWT as well
as into the few cattle herds, with the risk of the latter bringing the
infections south. But I come from a culture where wildlife are a crop like
any other
and therefore to be harvested, wisely. Martin Hugh-Jones, ProMED-AHEAD
