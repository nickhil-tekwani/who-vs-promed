Health authorities said Saturday [25 Jan 2014] they have found a chicken in a central region infected with avian influenza (AI), the 1st such case, raising an alarm that the deadly bird flu disease might be spreading.

Cases of AI reported so far all involved ducks. The latest case involving a chicken was reported at a farm in Buyeo [South Chungcheong Province], a town about 150 km [about 93 miles] from where the poultry disease was 1st detected at a duck farm in North Jeolla Province a week ago [17 Jan 2014].

[Buyeo is located in South Chungcheong (Chungcheongnam) Province, situated in central-west South Korea, northern to the North Jeolla (Jeollabuk) province where the 1st HPAI H5N8 outbreak has been identified in domestic ducks and in migratory birds. Both provinces can be seen in the administrative map at http://tinyurl.com/pt598jd. A HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map is available at http://healthmap.org/r/9Uwo.

In case HPAI is indeed circulating in a chicken flock, it is highly unlikely that only a single dead bird would be found. An official confirmation (or otherwise) of the new outbreak is anticipated, including the serotype involved. If the avian influenza strain is confirmed to be "highly pathogenic" (probably HPAI H5N8, similar to the one already reported from ducks), then the chickens -- being significantly more susceptible than ducks -- are expected to suffer high mortality rate, unless the flock is culled prior to virus spread. - Mod.AS]
