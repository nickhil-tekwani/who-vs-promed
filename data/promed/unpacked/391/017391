The National Center for Tropical Diseases (CENETROP), confirmed that the death of a 6 year old child from the Santa Rosa community [Carapari municipality] was caused by leptospirosis and [a] hantavirus.

Erasmo Tapial epidemiologist in the Virgen de Guadalupe Hospital, stated that the report received from CENETROP confirmed the cause of death. "We informed the authorities of a death case of a 6 year old child in our municipality, reported positive for both leptospirosis and for [a] hantavirus by CENTROP" Tapia said.

He that the child presented with symptoms 10 days earlier. His family decided to take him to the Virgen de Guadalupe Health Center 4 days after having had fever during 5 days, gastrointestinal pain, headache and vomiting, nausea and diarrhea. Unhappily, the boy arrived at the hospital without vital signs.

Given this, the Epidemiological Surveillance Unit carried out the related inquiries to determine the cause of death. After analysis of the clinical presentation, medical personnel took samples for laboratory testing for influenza, leptospirosis and hantaviruses and sent them to CENETROP in Santa Cruz.

Once the results were available, they proceeded according to established protocol and carried out control measures with family members of the deceased boy in the educational unit in the community.

[In 2015, there were several cases of hantavirus infection in Tarija department, south of Santa Cruz department. The previously reported 2015 cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) that occurred in Tarija department were confirmed. As noted in the previous comments, earlier cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome have been reported from tropical, lowland areas of Bolivia. The specific hantaviruses involved in these or previous cases in 2013, 2014 in Bolivia are not given.

In the lowland Amazon Basin of Bolivia, the possible hantavirus and its rodent hosts that might be involved in these hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) cases, include:
- Laguna Negra virus (_Calomys laucha_, _C. callosus_ and _Oligoryzomys microtis_)
- Rio Mamore (_Calomys calllosus_ and _Calomys laucha_)
- Rio Mearim (_Holochilus sciureus_)
- Bermejo (_Oligoryzomys chacoensis_)
- Neembucu (_O. chacoensis_)
- Oran (_O. longicaudatus_ ).

It is clear that there are a variety of hantaviruses in Bolivia that can cause HPS involving several rodent hosts and found in many different ecological settings. - Mod.TY]

In Clancy on a sunny morning out on the ranch, Spring of 2011, a woman went about her day like any other day. She and now her now deceased husband used to hike, ride horses, and take care of animals, but all of that changed that sunny morning.

She grabbed her cat's food dishes out of the old chicken coop, and that 5-minute chore changed her life. "I had to be on my hands and knees, and there was excrement all along the edges everywhere, so my face was this close to it", she said.

The symptoms started about a week later, when she said she felt tired all the time, very ill, with severe neck, and back aches. She said her memory is foggy but she remembers being driven to the hospital, doctors thought it was influenza or pneumonia. It took 3 trips before doctors realized that she had contracted the Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS). She was confused, scared, and hallucinating, and was hospitalized. "I flat-lined twice, and they couldn't get me ventilated because I was just too erratic and they couldn't get me sedated", she said. Her husband told her doctors had to strap her down, that she was hysterical like a rabid bobcat.

Hantavirus is a potentially fatal disease carried in the urine and droppings of some rodents. In Montana, it is found in deer mice.

"That's really the only mouse that transmits hantavirus in Montana", said Rachel Hinnekamp, Epidemiologist with the Montana Department of Public Health & Human Services. Hinnekamp said since 1993-2016 there have been 43 recorded cases of HPS in Montana; 10 of those have been fatal. According to the Montana Department of Public Health & Human Services, Hantavirus [-related disease] has shown up in about 40 percent of Montana counties. Since 1993 there have been 697 confirmed cases of HPS nationwide, a relatively small number, however, more than 1/3 of those cases have been fatal.

People contract the virus when they disturb and inhale dust containing the urine or feces of infected rodents.

The woman woke up a week later in the hospital. But HPS had a long and lasting impact on her life, she suffered lasting spinal and neurological damage. "You have to learn everything all over again", she said. She says she had to re-learn how to walk, and still have trouble getting her thoughts together. But she is staying strong. She said she is part of Hantavirus outreach groups across the US, to talk to others who are going through the disease or survived it.

Early symptoms include fatigue, fever and muscle aches, especially in the large muscle groups--thighs, hips, back, and sometimes shoulders. About half of all HPS patients also experience headaches, dizziness, chills, and abdominal problems, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.

Late symptoms
- Lungs fill with fluid
- Shortness of breath

Between 4-10 days after the initial phase of illness, the late symptoms of HPS appear. These include coughing and shortness of breath, with the sensation of, as one survivor put it, a "...tight band around my chest and a pillow over my face" as the lungs fill with fluid.

[This is the 1st case of Sin Nombre hantavirus infection in Montana that ProMED-mail has posted this year (2018), but cases have occurred recently in other western USA states. The hantavirus involved in the Montana case above and other cases in the western USA is Sin Nombre virus. Fatalities are due to hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HPS). HPS can be very serious, and patients developing the symptoms should seek medical attention at the earliest possible time. This is not always the case. About one 3rd of HPS cases are fatal. The case above indicates that there may be serious neurological problems after the acute phase of the disease is over.

Infected rodents shed the virus in feces, urine and saliva. Individuals opening up cabins or storage areas that have been closed over winter or cleaning areas with signs of rodent presence should heed the precautions that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends in order to avoid exposure to the virus (https://www.cdc.gov/rodents/cleaning/index.html).

Deer mice, _Peromyscus maniculatus_, are the reservoir hosts of the virus. An image of the deer mouse, can be seen at http://www.nsf.gov/news/mmg/media/images/mouse_f.jpg. - Mod.TY]
