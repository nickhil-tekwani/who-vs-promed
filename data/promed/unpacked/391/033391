A stricken sulphur-crested cockatoo, looking the worse for wear, has
been visiting an Avalon home for the past month. It is in fact the
kind of bird WIRES advises people to take to the vet so that it does
not spread a deadly disease to other birds. The cockatoo has been
visiting Tanja Zelenko's balcony, and she said it appeared unable to
eat and compete with the other cockatoos.

She said a 2nd bird displaying the same broken beak and missing
feathers had also been seen last week. "He was so beat up, we called
him Nigel from the movie Rio," she said. "I don't usually feed birds,
but this one we had to feed. He was really tame and gentle."

WIRES rescuer Mandy Beaumont said the disease, psittacine circovirus,
or beak and feather disease, was incurable. She said euthanasia was
the only humane way to treat the affected birds because it was highly
contagious and led to a slow, painful death by starvation.

"We're starting to see more birds coming into care suffering with the
virus, but there's absolutely nothing we can do for them. The National
Parks and Wildlife policy is that any bird with a contagious disease
should be euthanased to protect threatened species in particular." Ms
Beaumont said people should contain the bird and either call WIRES or
take it for diagnosis to their local vet clinic; there is no charge
for this service.

[On doing a search to locate where this sick bird was found, there
are apparently 2 Avalons in New South Wales and one in Victoria. I
suspect it is the following, as it has a population of 22 938 compared
to 905 and 161 for the other 2. It was also observed perched on a
"balcony," typical of a multistory apartment building, which are
commonly found in larger population centres but not in small towns and
villages. See: http://www.fallingrain.com/world/AS/02/Avalon.html.

According to The Merck Veterinary Manual, "psittacine beak and
feather disease" can be defined as follows: Psittacine beak and
feather disease (PBFD) is caused by a psittacine circovirus. The name
is not representative of the typical clinical presentation, which does
not include beak abnormalities, and is less likely to have the severe,
classic feather abnormalities that were seen in cockatoos when the
disease was 1st documented. PCR screening has greatly decreased the
prevalence of the virus in _Cacatua_ spp . Disease is still noted,
however, in African Gray parrots (_Eclectus_) , lovebirds
(_Agapornis_), lorikeets, and other species. This debilitating
infection may affect any psittacine, although Old World species are
most susceptible, and has been reported in wild and domestic birds.
The natural infection appears to occur primarily in juvenile birds,
with few instances of clinical infection seen in birds over 3 years
old.

Typical findings include feather loss, abnormal pin feathers
(constricted, clubbed, or stunted), abnormal mature feathers (blood in
shaft), and lack of powder down in applicable species. Pigment loss
may occur in colored feathers. Immunosuppression is present. Acute
infections in chicks also occur, with several days of depression
followed by profound changes in the developing feathers and sudden
death.

Diagnosis is based on gross appearance, PCR, and biopsies of affected
feather follicles showing basophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions. PCR
may be able to detect infection in birds that still appear healthy.

The contagious nature of PBFD and its probable terminal outcome in
clinically affected birds warrant isolation and eventual euthanasia in
most clinical cases. Strict hygiene with attention to dust control,
screening protocols including PCR, and lengthy quarantines are highly
recommended in cockatoo breeding colonies. The removal of all eggs for
cleaning and incubation may also be helpful. See:
http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/170222.htm&word=bea
k%2cand%2cfeather%2cdisease. For a picture of a severely affected
cockatoo, go to:

The circoviruses are very small non-enveloped icosahedral viruses
with a single stranded circular DNA genome. They produce PBFD disease
in birds as well as Pigeon circovirus and Chicken Anemia Agent
infections, and a 2nd circovirus causes postweaning multisystemic
wasting syndrome in pigs; 2 circoviruses have been identified in fish.
Typically, the virus targets the lymphoid tissue and causes
immunosuppression in the host. Members should be aware that there are
a number of conditions afflicting cockatoos which are not due to
circiviruses and from which they will recover. - Mod.MHJ]
