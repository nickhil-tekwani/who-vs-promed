Newcastle disease in Israel in hobby pigeons
---------------------------------------------
(immediate notification and final report)
(Date of previous outbreak of Newcastle disease in Israel reported to the
OIE: July 2004).
Information received on 17 May 2005 from Dr Moshe Chaimovitz, Director of
Veterinary and Animal Health Services, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development, Beit-Dagan:
Report date: 15 May 2005.
Reason for immediate notification: re-occurrence of a listed disease or
infection in a country or zone/compartment following a report declaring the
outbreak(s) ended.
Date of start of the event: February 2005.
Nature of diagnosis: clinical and laboratory.
Details of outbreaks:
Location of the outbreaks:
- a holding in Yoqneam, Yizrael district (date of start of the outbreak:
February 2005);
- Hadera, Hadera district (date of start of the outbreak: March 2005).
Total No. of susceptible animals in the outbreaks: 70 hobby pigeons.
Total No. of cases: 2.
Total No. of deaths: 2.
Total No. of animals destroyed: 68.
Intracerebral pathogenicity index: 1.15 in the outbreak of Yoqneam; 1.20 in
the outbreak of Hadera.
Source of outbreaks or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive.
Control measures undertaken:
- stamping out;
- screening;
- zoning;
- vaccination of all flocks (poultry and pigeons) in a radius of 10 km;
- disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s).
In Israel, law requires vaccination of all chickens, turkeys, ostriches and
pigeons against Newcastle disease. Immediately after the report of
suspicion, booster-vaccination orders were issued to the owners of all
poultry holdings in a radius of 10 km around each outbreak.
Other details/comments:
- Outbreak of Hadera: in the area of the outbreak and in the village there
are no poultry holdings.
- Outbreak of Yoqneam: all poultry holdings in a radius of 10 km from the
outbreak were checked serologically and/or clinically for Newcastle
disease. There were no indications of infection on any of these farms.

[An interesting outbreak. The fact that no holdings near the pigeon loft
had infection would argue that it reached the loft via a bird racing back
from a release site. As birds are held for a number of hours before they
are released en mass, my first suspicion would be there, and the history of
other birds sick in other racing lofts and non-returns from the source loft.
Otherwise I would look at the history of the transportation of the birds
from the affected loft to the release site. Did they share transport? And ... ?
A good shoe-leather investigation yet to be completed. - Mod.MHJ]
