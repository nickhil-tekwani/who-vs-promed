Highly pathogenic avian influenza in poultry in Thailand
--------------------------------------------------------
(A previous outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in poultry in
Thailand was reported to OIE in Nov 2005).
Information received on 24 and 26 Jul 2006 (dated 26 Jul) from Dr Yukol
Limlamthong, director general, Department of Livestock Development,
Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives, Bangkok:
Reason for immediate notification: reoccurrence of a listed disease or
infection in a country following a report declaring the outbreaks ended.
Identification of agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus
subtype H5N1.
Date of 1st confirmation of the event: 26 Jul 2006.
Date of start of the event: 16 Jul 2006.
Details of outbreak: An outbreak of avian influenza occurred in Pichitr
province, BangMulnarg district in a village. The outbreak started on 16 Jul
2006, including 295 susceptible native chickens. There were 31 cases and 31
deaths, with 264 animals destroyed.
Location of the outbreak: <http://www.oie.int/cartes/1930_THA.png>
Description of affected population: native chickens.
Laboratory where diagnostic tests were performed: Lower Northern Regional
Veterinary Research and Development Center, Department of Livestock
Development, Pitsanuloke province
Results: virus isolation and RT-PCR were positive on 26 Jul 2006.
Source of outbreak or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive.
Control measures undertaken: stamping out in the affected premises, with 75
per cent compensation; quarantine; movement control inside the country;
screening (cloacal swab sampling in a 5 km radius zone around the infected
premises involving 48 420 poultry [12 263 native chickens and 36 157 ducks]
of 329 farmers); zoning; disinfection of the affected premises, all
infected/contaminated materials and high risk areas.
Vaccination prohibited: yes.
Other details/comments:
- The outbreak was found during the 2006 2nd active surveillance program,
in progress since 1 Jun 2006 in high risk areas. The purpose of the
surveillance is to detect any potential cases of HPAI in accordance with
OIE recommendations.
- The Pichitr Provincial Livestock Office has declared the whole of
BangMulnarg district as an HPAI infected area, which allows the authorities
of the Department of Livestock Development to conduct full scale disease
control measures.
- Active clinical surveillance in a 10 km radius zone, with a ban on the
movement of poultry for a period of 30 days from 22 Jul 2006, the date on
which disinfection of the affected premises was completed. There are 110
322 poultry (48 614 native chickens and 61 708 ducks) of 1091 farmers
involved in these activities.
- Any poultry restocking in the affected areas can be carried out after 90
days (that is, not before 21 Oct 2006) provided that no more positive cases
are detected.

[You can see the location of Pichitr province at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Thailand>.
The BangMulnarg district is not the same location as the one in which a 17
year old boy died, whose case is listed by the ministry of health website
to have occurred in Thap Khlo district; see
<http://thaigcd.ddc.moph.go.th/AI_case_report_060729.html>.
The fact that the boy was not from the same district as this reported
outbreak in backyard chickens is not too significant, as the boy had a
history of exposure to dead birds, and it is likely that other outbreaks
than the one reported here have occurred in this district as well as in
neighboring Phitsanulok province, see references below.
If indeed there were widespread poultry outbreaks that were not reported
with high levels of transparency, this would represent a breakdown in the
public health system as well as the animal health system, as animal and
human health are tied together in this disease. Important public health
messages require continually updated animal risk information.
Communications to prevent contact with infected birds might be obscured or
downplayed if there were no official reports of avian influenza outbreaks
in birds. It is essential that animal health authorities in each country be
trusted assessors of the status of disease in the country. Otherwise, the
risk of zoonotic disease transmission will be heightened significantly. -
