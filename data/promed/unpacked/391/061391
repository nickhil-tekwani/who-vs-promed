* Cases with neurologic manifestations (such as WN encephalitis,

** Cases with no evidence of neuroinvasion.
*** Cases for which insufficient clinical information was provided.
**** Total number of human cases of WNV illness reported to ArboNET by
state and local health departments.
Neuroinvasive Disease refers to severe disease cases, particularly West
Nile meningitis and West Nile encephalitis.
West Nile fever refers to typically less severe cases that show no evidence
of neuroinvasion. West Nile fever is not currently on the list of
nationally notifiable diseases, and therefore it is optional whether or not
state health departments report these cases to CDC. Click the above CDC
site [URL above] for further explanations of neuroinvasive West Nile virus
disease and West Nile fever.
Other Clinical includes persons with clinical manifestations other than WN
fever, WN encephalitis or WN meningitis, such as acute flaccid paralysis.
Unspecified cases are those for which sufficient clinical information was
not provided.
Total Human Cases Reported to CDC: These numbers reflect both mild and
severe human disease cases occurring since 1 Jan 2006 that have been
reported to ArboNet by state and local health departments. ArboNet is the
national, electronic surveillance system established by CDC to assist
states in tracking West Nile virus and other mosquito-borne viruses.
Information regarding 2006 virus/disease activity is posted when such cases
are reported to CDC.

[WN virus continues to be detected in a wider geographic area in the USA
and in Canada, and the numbers of human cases increased during the past
week (ending 23 Aug 2006). Given the increase in the number of human cases
in Texas, it seems likely that cases are occurring in the northern Mexican
states as well. ProMED requests information on West Nile virus
surveillance from Mexico and Central and South America. - Mod.TY]
