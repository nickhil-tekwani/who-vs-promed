On Wed 5 Oct 2005, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), working together with the Mississippi Department of Health,
confirmed a diagnosis of rabies as the cause of death in a Mississippi child.
The patient had been hospitalized with encephalitis of undetermined
origin in September 2005. No history of foreign travel or definitive
animal exposure was identified. A greater than 4-fold rise in rabies
virus antibodies was demonstrated in both paired serum and
cerebrospinal fluid samples. No other clinical specimens were
available to allow viral characterization and identification of a
likely animal source of infection.
Bats are the only known reservoirs of rabies in Mississippi, and the
state has reported no human cases since 1956. Although the child
stayed at a popular summer camp in Alabama and participated in an
overnight caving event in Tennessee during the summer, there were no
known exposure incidents at either venue. On additional
investigation, it was reported that the child removed a live bat from
his bedroom in the spring of this year. The Mississippi Department of
Health, in conjunction with local medical staff and CDC, conducted an
investigation to identify contacts of the patient among family, the
local community, and health-care workers. CDC will continue to work
with other state health departments and health-care providers as
additional information becomes available.
Human rabies PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis) is recommended only in
situations in which potentially infectious material (e.g., saliva)
from a rabid animal or human is introduced via a bite, or comes into
direct contact with broken skin or mucous membranes. In addition,
when a bat is physically present and rabies infection cannot be ruled
out by testing the bat, human rabies PEP might be appropriate if
there is a reasonable probability that an exposure might have
occurred, such as when a bite cannot be excluded.
This is the 1st report of a human rabies case in the United States in
2005, and the 48th human case reported since 1990. Although human
rabies is extremely rare in the United States, people are advised to
exercise caution in settings where they might have contact with
wildlife, especially bats, raccoons, skunks, and foxes. Camping and
other outdoor activities do not present an elevated risk for rabies
exposure. Regardless of activity, people should avoid contact with
wildlife and stray animals.

[In fact the greatest risk for naturally acquired rabies in the
United States is from encounters with and bites from insectivorous
bats. In particular, a rabies virus variant associated with 2
small-bodied bats, the eastern pipistrelle bat (_Pipistrellus
subflavus_) and silver-haired bat (_Lasionycteris noctivagans_), was
identified in 20 (69 percent) of 29 persons with samples tested. See:
