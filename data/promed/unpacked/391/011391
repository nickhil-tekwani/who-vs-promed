Since the last update (28 Aug 2000), CFIA sampling teams continue to survey
PPV-susceptible trees in the Niagara Peninsula, and as of September 8, had
collected a total of 47 195 samples.
New positive samples were distributed at some of the 24 previously known
positive sites and at 5 new locations in the Niagara Peninsula (in the Towns
of Lincoln, St. Catharines, and Niagara-on-the-Lake) and at one new location
near Simcoe, bringing the total number of positive samples to 681 (out of
41 346 tested), clustered at 30 locations. Sampling continues both around
the positive sites and at other orchards across the Niagara Peninsula. A
detection survey of stone-fruit trees from production areas across Canada,
including Southwestern Ontario, will continue until continue until
approximately mid-October 2000.
Samples are now being tested by the CFIA Centre for Animal and Plant Health
in Charlottetown, P.E.I., in addition to CFIA laboratories in Sidney, B.C.
and Nepean, Ontario.
Results of the survey as of 8 Sep 2000:
Total PPV-susceptible Prunus samples collected - 47 195
Total PPV-susceptible Prunus samples tested* - 41 346
Total PPV-positive site locations - 30 (27, Niagara Peninsula, 2 near
Blenheim, 1 near Simcoe)
Total PPV-positive samples - 681
Total PPV-negative samples - 40 665
*Sample testing always lags behind sample collection due to sample delivery
and laboratory test processing.

[Hopefully survey results from areas outside of Ontario will be negative. -
