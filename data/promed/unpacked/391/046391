A moratorium on the movement of chickens, dead or alive, has been put into effect in a commune of Prey Veng's Ba Phnom district after a chicken sample tested positive for avian influenza H5N1, the provincial Department of Agriculture, Forests and Fisheries said today [Thu 15 Feb 2017].

The infected bird originated from Prey Phdao village and was one among 100 tested from Sdao Korng commune, according to department director Ouk Samnang, who said that the Ministry of Agriculture had ordered the spray of suspected areas with disinfectant as well as a halt in the movement of birds throughout the commune.

"Trafficking of animals in the area has to be prevented in order not to spread this disease to other places," Samnang said.

The ban will remain in effect until authorities see fit to lift it, he noted, adding that no human cases have been found.

Last month [January 2018], 135 chickens were culled in Phnom Penh's Sen Sok district as a preventative measure after a suspected case was found. Similarly, in December [2017] over 200 chickens were culled in Kampong Cham's Prey Chhor.
