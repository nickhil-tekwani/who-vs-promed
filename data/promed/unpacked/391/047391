Cholera in the Comoros Islands
As of 11 March, 945 cases of cholera with 18 deaths (case fatality rate
1.9%) have been reported since the beginning of the epidemic which
started in Mbeni, 40 km north of the capital Moroni, in early January.
Over 50% (476) of the cases occurred in Moroni where most cases have
been treated at the El Maarouf Hospital. The other 469 cases have been
treated in the following health districts: Mitsamiouli (259), Mbéni
(105), Foumbouni (80), Ouzioini (18), and Mitsoudje (7). All cases
occurred on Grand Comore Island.
The National Cholera Control Committee was set up in collaboration with
WHO to implement a control and preparedness plan. WHO, along with
representatives of La Cooperation Francaise, Medecins Sans Frontieres,
Médecins du Monde, and the national Red Cross assessed the situation in
February. Several areas that needed strengthening to control the
outbreak were identified, the foremost being improved personal, domestic
and environmental hygiene, including the supply of safe water.
