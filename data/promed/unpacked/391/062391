[Newcastle disease is caused by an avian paramyxovirus, APMV-1, which has
been known to affect more than 250 different types of birds, in 27
different orders. Some birds, like poultry, are highly susceptible, while
many other birds, especially some wild birds, are asymptomatic carriers.

While we mostly think of Newcastle disease as a threat to poultry and one
of the 2 most important diseases affecting international trade in
commercial poultry, the disease has definitely been known to infect these
other species of birds. Pigeons are commonly infected and smuggled
psittacine pet birds that can bring big money in the market, have also been
known to introduce disease into Newcastle disease free areas.

This outbreak, while apparently brought under quick control by the animal
health authorities, should serve to remind us that some avian members of
zoo type collections are also susceptible.
