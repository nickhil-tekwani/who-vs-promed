At least 14 anthrax-infected patients were detected at village Raghunathpur of Raiganj upazila in Sirajganj [District, Rajshahi Division] Sunday evening [30 Mar 2014].

They are HB, 35, wife of HnA; SK, 40, wife of HdA; HM, 35; SK, 50, wife of AH; CK, 40, wife of ANH; NH, 35; JK, 22; MH, 26; SH, 32; MA, 50; AH, 50; PK, 18, daughter of AA; AK, 60; and RK, 8, daughter of TA.

Sirajganj civil surgeon Main Uddin Mia and his sanitary inspector Mohammad Ali Zinnah said [these villagers] were infected during slaughtering and preparing the meat of an anthrax-affected cow of Shaheb Ali of village Raghunathpur on [15 Mar 2014]. However, symptoms of the disease were noticed after 13 days.

The district health department as well as the upazila Prani Shampad department treated them locally, while HK was admitted to Bogra Medical College and Hospital in a critical condition.

A medical team from the health directorate in Dhaka had already visited the village, they added.

[Our thanks to Mat for this report. I gather from Mat that an investigation team is due to visit the village shortly to investigate this outbreak, and collect soil and feed samples.

It is interesting that the owner of the sick and butchered cow is not listed among the sick. Otherwise the age range of the afflicted is very much as expected, with 4 of the 13 adults being wives. Children are not so often noted but they help out and carry meat home, and thus on occasion become infected. The lack of children in these events reflect a lack of exposure, not an age resistance. "HK" does not appear among the listed patients and so is either a 15th case or one of the women listed under a different name.
