Two different _Salmonella_ outbreaks have been reported in Finland with one linked to zucchini from Spain. The 1st outbreak, in the Finnish city of Rovaniemi, affected 20 people, but a source was not found. The 2nd incident, in the city of Mikkeli, led to 8 illnesses and was caused by contaminated chopped zucchini from Spain that was put in a salad.

Officials in Rovaniemi initially reported a suspected outbreak in early December 2020. Onset of symptoms for the 1st patients began on 17 Nov [2020]. The alarm was raised after 3 _Salmonella_ infections were reported linked to food supplied by the central kitchen in Rovaniemi to day-care centers and schools between 13 and 20 Nov [2020]. Food was delivered to more than 40 schools and kindergartens. According to typing by the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) it was found to be _Salmonella_ Saintpaul and not the same type of bacteria that caused infections in Mikkeli. The incident was also reported to the Finnish Food Authority (Ruokavirasto).

In total, 20 people were affected from different kindergartens and schools in November and December [2020]. _Salmonella_ was not detected in food, from environmental samples taken, or in tests of foodservice employees. Officials said the origin of the outbreak had not yet been determined from samples and interviews. All of those infected developed symptoms during the same period, suggesting the source was a single raw material consumed in mid-November [2020]. Investigation of the epidemic is continuing through interviews, but no new samples will be taken.

In 2019, 200 salmonellosis cases were reported to THL in which the infection was acquired in Finland. In the past decade, the country has recorded between zero and 4 outbreaks per year.

The _Salmonella_ outbreak in Mikkeli was first reported in early December [2020] with 6 people sick and grew to 8 patients affected. Initial suspicions fell on salad delivered through a wholesaler to central kitchens in Mikkeli and kitchens in Haukivuori and Ristiina, both places in Mikkeli, between 23 and 27 Nov [2020]. Product was mostly sent to schools, day-care centers, and the South Savo Social and Health Care Authority (ESSOTE). The salad was offered to more than 6000 people in the Mikkeli area.

_Salmonella_ was found in one of the food samples in the central kitchen of Mikkeli, thanks to self-monitoring checks. The investigation included THL and Ruokavirasto. Salad was served in 2 different batches prepared on 26 and 27 Nov [2020]. A carrot-and-zucchini salad was found to have _Salmonella_ Kedougou by Ruokavirasto. Zucchini, which was an ingredient in the salad and came from Spain, also tested positive for _Salmonella_ at a local laboratory. It arrived at the kitchens in Finland pre-chopped, and product from that lot is no longer on the market. Seven patients were confirmed to have been infected by the rare _S._ Kedougou strain. This same type of _Salmonella_ has also been found in 2 patients in the hospital districts of Satakunta and Central Finland in December [2020].

Authorities are now evaluating processes in the kitchens and products used in them to try and prevent a repeat outbreak. Zucchini has been removed from the menus of local central and manufacturing kitchens for the time being. However, imported products will continue to be used at times when Finnish fresh vegetables are limited.
