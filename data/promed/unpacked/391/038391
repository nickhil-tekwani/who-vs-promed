The Provincial Health Office (PHO) [in Tarlac City, Philippines reported
an "alarming" 44 percent increase in dog bite cases in the province, from
711 in 1998 to 983 from January 1 to Nov. 15.
Board Member Alvin Belarmino, author of Provincial Ordinance 006-98
creating the Provincial Rabies Council, appealed to the public to practice
dog leashing to control the movement of their pets and prevent them from
straying and posing public harm.
The provincial government has yet to create ordinances encouraging
responsible dog ownership, including dog registration, dog transport,
compulsory leashing and impounding of stray dogs in the province.
The Provincial Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit (PESU) reported at least
7 known deaths due to rabies this year. "But there could be more because
some of the cases are not being reported, especially those in the remote
areas, and this has been going on for decades now," Belarmino, a Doctor of
Veterinary Medicine (veterinarian) said.
"Rabies, a highly dreaded disease, has registered an alarming rate of
occurrence in the Province of Tarlac and its neighboring areas, a situation
calling for the provincial government's immediate concern and attention,"
said Belarmino.
The Provincial Veterinarian's Office (PVO), lacking in personnel and
vaccines, has immunized only 6.7 percent or 14 000 of the estimated 207 446
dog population in the province since January this year. In the provincial
government's plantilla, there is only one item for a provincial
veterinarian, while the other eight items, one veterinarian and eight
animal husbandry graduates, are PVO details from the Department of
Agriculture.
"The ideal is to immunize 80 percent of the dog population," said Dr. Vic
Atienza, chief, Animal Health Division, Bureau of Animal Industry.
The PHO, on the other hand, needs P498 000 to purchase "passive anti-rabies
vaccines" for the growing number of dog bite victims trooping to PESU
clinic at the Tarlac Provincial Hospital (TPH). Only active vaccines are
provided free at the TPH.
Even if the active vaccines are given free, dog bite victims still spend
P5000 to P10 000, depending on their weight, for the passive vaccines. Both
active and passive vaccines are needed to prevent the spread of the rabies
virus," said PESU nurse Cecille Lopez.
"When the anti-rabies vaccines are not given on time to a person bitten by
a rabies-carrying dog, and the rabies virus reaches the brain, the patient
will show symptoms like hydrophobia and photophobia, the case becomes
irreversible, there is no more treatment, and death follows," Lopez said.
