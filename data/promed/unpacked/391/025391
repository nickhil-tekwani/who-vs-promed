Officials: Anthrax outbreak no threat to public health
-------------------------------------------------------
There is no danger to public health in the wake of last week's anthrax
outbreak in southeast Reno, Washoe County public officials said Tuesday.
The Damonte and Bella Vista ranches lost almost a dozen cattle last week
during the second agricultural anthrax outbreak of the year in Nevada.
"This is an unfortunate year," said Dr. Ron Anderson, an epidemiologist
with the Animal Disease Laboratory. "It's kind of unusual, but the
situation is under control," he said. Washoe District Health Officer
Barbara Hunt said the outbreak presents no risk to the public. "Persons who
handle the dead or dying animals are the only ones at risk for exposure,"
Hunt said. "It's an agricultural issue, not a public health issue."
The Damonte Ranch lost 15 cattle and the Bella Vista Ranch lost 8. "If you
want to put a dollar figure on that, it's about $700 to $800 per head,"
said Louis Damonte Jr., one of the Damonte Ranch's owners. The Damonte
Ranch had an anthrax outbreak about a decade ago he said [Actually 1993&4.
Cattle at both ranches have been vaccinated or given strong antibiotics.
"Both ranches have been good about following proper disposal of cattle that
died," Hunt said. "We're feeling hopeful that this situation can come to a
close."
An earlier anthrax outbreak this year occurred in Mid-August, when 30 head
of cattle died at a ranch near Gerlach [Also in Washoe County.

[Thanks to Bill Kvasnicka I have some more details. Firstly the Damonte
outbreak started about 3 weeks ago and had 15 deaths. The carcasses were
buried for some reason. The Bella Vista herd had been grazing on a pasture
of short grazing & stubble and deaths started on 31 Aug 2000 and there had
been 16 dead; the dead also buried. They are probably independent outbreaks
and both from soil contamination as the herds are not contiguous.
The affected area is on old anthrax meadow of the 1950s immediately south
of the city of Reno and increasingly encroached by suburbia and light
industrial buildings -- thus the calming public health comments. It might
also explain the decision to bury and not burn. Burying anthrax carcasses
is now realized to be the least optimum solution and has, in the past,
ensured later outbreaks, though not in all instances. The outbreak, north
of Reno, at Gerlach eventually ceased but with some 56 cattle deaths.
