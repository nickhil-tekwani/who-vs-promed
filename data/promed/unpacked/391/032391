Free living ameba linked to death of 2 boys
--------------------
The same rare strain of meningitis [_Naegleria fowleri_] that killed
a 5-year-old Glendale boy last Sunday morning also killed a
5-year-old Peoria boy, autopsy results released Friday confirmed. I
nstead of making things clearer, it actually has made them muddier.
The two boys had nothing in common except they got sick on the same
night and one boy often visited his grandparents' home, which is
located near the other boy's home.
Both became sick on Oct. 9 and were hospitalized with what turned out
to be meningitis. Tests by the Maricopa County Medical Examiner's
Office determined both boys died of the same amoebic parasite,
Naegleria fowleri, a common organism [in lakes] that only rarely
causes primary amoebic meningoencephalitis. "We still don't have an
outbreak, we still don't have a contagious case," said Doug Hauth, a
spokesman for the Maricopa County Public Health Department. "We
still have a geographic anomaly of these children contracting the
disease and living near each other." County health investigators
spent Friday sampling water and walking through the neighborhood
trying to find the source of the disease. Early test results are
expected Monday. The rareness of the parasite as a cause of
meningitis is puzzling, even more so since it can only be transmitted
by swimming in warm, stagnant water.

[The infection is rare although the ameba is free living in warm,
stagnant water. Most previous reports of Naegleria infection in
ProMED-mail have come from Texas where 32 cases of amebic meningitis
have been reported since 1972 of which _N. fowleri_ was identified in
27 of the cases. In 2001, Texas saw a cluster of three cases. The
risk of infection in the US is very low and clustering of two cases
simultaneously must almost certainly mean that they share the source
of infection. -Mod.EP]
