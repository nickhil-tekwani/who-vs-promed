Bukidnon under quarantine for cassava disease
---------------------------------------------
The Department of Agriculture (DA) raises alert for all cassava plants/planting materials coming from Bukidnon province [Northern Mindanao, region X] after it was found heavily infected with cassava witches' broom (CWB). CWB is a major disease resulting in high yield loss of 100 per cent if symptoms are observed during the establishment [of the plants], 40-60 per cent if the symptoms appear 5 months after planting until harvest.

Secretary Proceso Alcala has already released a quarantine order dated [5 Jun 2015], placing the entire province under quarantine and prohibiting movement, transfer or carrying of cassava plants from any other areas except for research purposes, provided it's been approved by the Bureau of Plant and Industry (BPI).

Larry E Paraluman, DA regional field office, said occurrences and incidence of CWB was already observed in 2011 through a research study conducted by the Visayas State University on Philippine Root Crops. "Bukidnon is a major source of cassava planting materials, and CWB is found spread now across all regions in the country," he said.

DA sampling shows positive results [also] in several municipalities in the provinces of Misamis Occidental and Misamis Oriental in Northern Mindanao, as well as in Lanao del Norte province in Central Mindanao (region XII).

[Two phytoplasmas have been reported to be associated with witches' broom disease of cassava (CWBD) in different areas: in South East Asia, cassava witches' broom phytoplasma (synonym cassava phyllody phytoplasma; _Candidatus_ Phytoplasma asteris group 16SrI); and in Brazil a phytoplasma of the 16SrIII (X-disease) group, which also contains the cassava frogskin pathogen from the southern Americas (see ProMED-mail post 20071130.3864).

Symptoms may include excessive proliferation of branches ('witches' brooms'), small leaves, shortened internodes, purple discolouration of 'brooms', stunting, and loss of plant vigour. Characteristically, shoot distortion or leaf chlorosis are not normally observed. Tubers are reduced in size with rough textured skin and brown streaks in the flesh. The disease can seriously affect starch content of tubers. Total crop losses have been reported as well as up to 30 per cent reduction in starch content of harvestable roots. CWBD also leads to loss of planting material. Disease development is favoured by moderate temperatures, symptoms become less obvious or even disappear at higher temperatures.

CWBD is mainly spread by vegetative propagation of the crop, and mechanical transmission (for example with agricultural tools) has also been reported. No insect vectors have been identified so far, but research on CWBD epidemiology is continuing. Disease management relies on the use of certified clean planting material. Thermotherapy followed by meristem tip culture may be used to obtain phytoplasma-free tissue culture lines for propagation.
