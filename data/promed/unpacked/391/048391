Livestock officials are rushing to vaccinate cattle in all districts
after 24 buffaloes died of the fatal "swollen-neck" disease in
Prachin Buri province.

The disease, known as haemorrhagic septicemia [HS], claimed the lives
of the animals in tambon Yanri of Kabin Buri district, as the
province, earlier deluged by heavy rain and floods, has now entered
the cold season.

The situation prompted the Department of Livestock Development to
declare tambon Yanri an outbreak zone and prohibit the transportation
of cattle suspected of contracting the disease.

"The outbreak of haemorrhagic septicemia likely results from bacteria
normally living in cattle and attacking them when they are weakened,"
said livestock official Sathit Somsong.

Infected cattle or buffaloes become lethargic and do not move. They
get a high fever, and their necks become swollen. They usually die of
severe pneumonia between one and 2 days after the symptoms occur, Mr
Sathit said.

Officials are vaccinating cattle and buffaloes in a 5-km radius of
Kabin Buri district. They are also preparing to vaccinate all cattle
in all districts to safeguard them from the disease.

The disease cannot be transmitted to humans. However, villagers have
been warned against eating the meat of cattle that had died from the
disease or touching dead or sick animals as they may spread the
disease to other cattle.

Haemorrhagic septicemia has occurred occasionally in Thailand. The
most severe outbreak was 7 years ago in Narathiwat's Sungai Kolok and
Tak Bai districts and Pattani's Yarang district when 1000 buffaloes
died.

[The following background information on HS has been derived from
chapter 2.04.12 of OIE's Terrestrial Manual, available on-line at
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/2008/pdf/2.04.12_HS.pdf>,
where data on diagnostic methods and vaccine production and testing
requirements, as well as a detailed reference list, can be found as
well:

"Haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS) is a major disease of cattle and
buffaloes occurring as catastrophic epizootics in many Asian and
African countries, resulting in high mortality and morbidity. The
disease has been recorded in wild mammals in several Asian and
European countries. In many Asian countries, disease outbreaks mostly
occur during the climatic conditions typical of monsoon (high
humidity and high temperatures). The disease is caused by
_Pasteurella multocida_, a Gram-negative coccobacillus residing
mostly as a commensal in the upper respiratory tract of animals. The
Asian serotype B:2 and the African serotype E:2 (Carter and
Heddleston system), corresponding to 6:B and 6:E (Namioka-carter
system), are mainly responsible for the disease. In wild animals,
serotype B:2,5 is predominantly present. The association of other
serotypes, namely A:1, A:3 with a HS-like condition in cattle and
buffaloes in India has been recorded.

HS has been erroneously and widely used as a synonym for shipping
fever and other infections. The result has been that the disease has
been mistakenly reported in South America and elsewhere. There was
similar confusion in the 1940s, and the differences between the
diseases have been clarified. HS and shipping fever are 2 separate
conditions caused by different bacteria (_Pasteurella multocida_ vs
_Mannheimia haemolytica_). Unlike HS, shipping fever is not
septicaemic nor does it cause multisystemic petechial haemorrhages.

The clinical manifestations of the typical disease caused by B:2 or
E:2 strains include a rise in temperature, respiratory distress with
nasal discharge, and frothing from the mouth, and leads to recumbency
and death. Infection with serotypes A:1 and A:3 predominantly
involves pneumonia resulting in mortality. Septicaemia is the
characteristic feature in all the disease conditions. The incubation
period varies from 3 to 5 days. In peracute cases, sudden death with
observable clinical signs may be observed. Buffaloes are generally
more susceptible to HS than cattle and show more severe forms of
disease with profound clinical signs. Subcutaneous oedema from the
mandible to the brisket is one distinctive feature of the disease in
endemic areas; most deaths are confined to older calves and young
adults.

Massive epizootics may occur in endemic as well as non-endemic areas.
In the recent past, HS has been identified as a secondary
complication in cattle and buffalos following outbreaks of foot and
mouth disease (FMD) [see commentary re. recent outbreak in Orissa,
India].

Case fatality approaches 100 percent if treatment is not followed at
the initial stage of infection. The diagnosis of the disease is based
on the clinical signs, gross pathological lesions, morbidity and
mortality patterns, and confirmation by isolation of the pathogens
and their conventional and molecular characterisation."

On 25 Oct 2008, ProMED-mail posted information from Orissa, India
regarding mass mortality in buffaloes, allegedly suspected to be
related to FMD. Since HS is a plausible differential diagnosis for
such events, information on the outcome of the epidemiological and
laboratory investigation was requested; so far, no response has been
obtained. - Mod.AS]
