A contagious antibiotic-resistant [bacterium infected 134 people in four
Melbourne
hospitals last year and early this year. In the previous three years, only
16 people across Victoria were known carriers of the bacteria.
Vancomycin-resistant entercoccus (VRE) can infect and kill people with weak
immune systems. The antibiotic vancomycin, used as a drug of last resort to
treat [_Staphylococcus aureus_, is powerless against VRE.
The number of patients harbouring the aggressive [_Staphylococcus aureus_ has
increased 37 per cent at the same four hospitals - Royal Melbourne, Austin,
Alfred and Maroondah - since 1996.
Associate Professor John Turnidge, of the Australian Group on Antimicrobial
Resistance, said more people would die unnecessarily unless state and
federal governments devoted more resources to the problem.
Prof Turnidge said there was no comprehensive data available to determine
the death toll caused by resistant [bacterial infections acquired in
hospital. "I believe there is a strong case for re-thinking resistant
bacteria as a public health problem and currently it's not accepted as
that," he said.
Health officials say the figures have risen as hospitals increasingly test
patients in search of carriers. Staff usually test patients for
[_Staphylococcus aureus_ and VRE, which was first detected in Australia in
1994, only if they show symptoms of infection.
