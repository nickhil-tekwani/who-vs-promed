The statement above is wrong. Maybe Alex has confused hanta and Hantaan
(which is not so rare). Bashkirian HFRS is caused by Puumala hantavirus,
carried by the bank vole _Clethrionomys glareolus_. Maybe Prof. Tkachenko
could give more data.
Hantaan virus has not been found in Europe. Instead, two strains of Dobrava,
one in _Apodemus agrarius_, the other in _A. flavicollis_ [field mice, are
found in Europe. Dobrava belongs to the same murine clade of hantaviruses as
Seoul and Hantaan.

[Perhaps the root of the problem is that serotyping is not as specific as
PCR. Antibody tests may not distinguish reliably between closely related
hantaviruses, whereas I presume Heikki´s results are with the more specific
PCR. Or maybe Hantaan virus has sneaked around the southern end of the Ural
mountains. In any case, Alex´s lab has said it will make sera from the
outbreak available for testing - Mod.JW
