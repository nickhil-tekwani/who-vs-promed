Fiocruz [Oswaldo Cruz Foundation] in Bahia state confirms new Zika virus cases
-------------------------------------------------
A new virus known as Zika, transmitted by the same mosquitoes as dengue and chikungunya [viruses], has begun to circulate in Brazil. The 1st cases were confirmed this month [May 2015] in Bahia and now scientists confirmed the presence of the virus in Rio Grande do Norte as well. There are also reports, unconfirmed, of patients in northeastern states of Maranhao, Pernambuco, Sergipe, and Paraiba, as well as suspected ones in Rio de Janeiro. The symptoms of these 3 illnesses [dengue, chikungunya, and Zika] are similar, but worrisome for researchers and, especially, for the eventual occurrence of simultaneous outbreaks [of the 3 diseases], that could cause more serious complications.

Samples from 21 patients in Natal were tested by Fiocruz scientists along with collaboration from the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande Norte. They used molecular tests that were developed in countries with greater incidence of [Zika virus] disease and showed that genetic material of 8 of the samples were of the new virus. For the rest [of the 21], they guaranteed that they are not dealing with dengue or chikungunya [viruses]. "Possibly they are also Zika virus but we are not able to get proof because the viruses circulate in the individual's blood for 2-3 days, and the tests are not sensitive enough to detect it after this period," explained virologist Claudia Nunes Duarte dos Santos, Research Coordinator and head of the Molecular Virology Laboratory of the Instituto Carlos Chagas/Fiocruz Parana. "The data show that, in fact, the disease is spreading in the country."

In addition to symptoms similar to those of dengue and chikungunya -- pain in the joints and body, headache, fever, nausea diarrhea, and malaise -- Zika virus [infections] can cause photophobia, conjunctivitis, and rash over the whole body, including the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, accompanied by itching. After the mosquito bite, symptoms appear between 3-12 days and last for 4 days to a week. Specialists say that the symptoms are milder than for the other 2 illnesses [dengue and chikungunya], and no deaths have been registered. The concern, really, is about co-infections.

"[Zika virus infection] is less serious, but it is possible to acquire the 3 viruses simultaneously, and we do not know what the clinical course would be of these co-infections with Zika virus, for which there is no [pre-existing] immunity," Claudia speculated. "There is need for thorough research to clarify this [possibility] and develop treatment [approaches].

In Rio de Janeiro, the symptoms of some patients have confused Fiocruz researchers who, after testing [samples from] a series of [patients with] diseases, decided to send samples from these individuals for evaluation in Parana. The unit had been working with other viruses, and was responsible for the isolation of chikungunya [virus] in Feira de Santana, in Bahia, a city that is living through an outbreak of the disease.

"Since last year [2014] in Brazil there is an increasing number of patients who have shown symptoms of the disease. We have reports from the northern region," said Claudia.

There are 2 types of Zika virus strains [subtypes]: an Asian one and an African one. Research that was done with genetic sequencing of the material from Natal gave data that "indicated strongly" that we are dealing with the Asia strain, said Claudia. The next step of the research will be to identify how and where the virus was introduced into Brazil. The most likely hypothesis is that the virus had arrived in the country via visiting foreigners during the World Cup games [in Brazil in 2014].

In the case of Bahia, 12 samples of Zika virus were confirmed on 29 Apr 2015 from patients of the Camacari municipality. According to the Federal University of Bahia (UFBA), responsible for the discovery, the disease has also affected individuals of Salvador, Feira de Santana and other municipalities in Bahia.

The results from Bahia as well as those of Rio Grande do Norte were sent to the Ministry of Health, which stated that the samples will be tested by the Instituto Evandro Chagas in Belem [a national reference laboratory] and/or the US CDC. According to the Ministry, confirmation will occur only after the report is issued from a reference laboratory.

The mosquitoes that transmit the disease [virus] are those known as _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_, present in the American Continent [in localities] that suffer outbreaks of dengue and chikungunya. So while as of now there have been no recent confirmed cases on the mainland -- just one recorded in February 2014, on Easter Island, Chile -- there is the possibility that the disease is spreading silently, according to Claudia [dos Santos]. "It is likely that [disease from] Zika virus is going unnoticed. "

Because of this, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), linked to the World Health Organization (WHO), has warned of the risk of outbreaks. "The wide distribution of vectors in the Americas, combined with the high degree of mobility of people in the region and in the world, represent a risk of dissemination of Zika virus in the American Continent, according to a statement published on 7 May 2015.

The agency recommends that surveillance for this pathogen must be organized based on the same system that exists for dengue and chikungunya, taking into account the clinical differences. "Mosquito control is the only way that virus transmission by the vectors can be interrupted, " it adds. [What differences? There is no single symptom that is unique to Zika virus disease. - Mod.JW]

New to the American Continent, the disease was described for the 1st time in 1947 in the Zika Forest in Uganda. About 20 years later, it was confirmed in humans in Nigeria. And, from there, it spread to regions of Africa (in countries like Tanzania, Egypt, Sierra Leone, and Gabon) and Asia (India, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, Viet Nam, and Indonesia), then reaching Oceania. In 2007, there was an outbreak in Yap Island in Micronesia, where 185 cases were recorded.

In 2013, there was an outbreak in French Polynesia. On that occasion, there were no deaths. However, of the 10 000 registered cases, 70 were considered serious, presenting with neurological complications -- Guillain Barre syndrome and meningoencephalitis -- and thrombocytopenic purpura and leucopenia. Studies are being conducted to investigate whether [these serious cases] occurred due to co-infection with other viruses, since there was a concurrent outbreak of dengue [going on].

There is no vaccine for any of these [3] diseases. The current treatment is just symptomatic. The use of paracetamol [acetaminophen] is recommended to relieve fever and antihistamines against itching. As with dengue, aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) and anti-inflammatory drugs are not recommended due to the risk of bleeding. Patients should also drink plenty of fluids.

[The arrival of Zika virus in Brazil is not good news. Vector mosquitoes are abundant and there is a large population of susceptible people, not just in Brazil, but, as the cited WHO report indicates, throughout the Americas where outbreaks of dengue and chikungunya virus infections occur (see http://www.paho.org/HQ/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_view&gid=30078+&Itemid=999999). Although the Zika virus isolates have not yet been confirmed by the national or international reference laboratories, the Parana laboratory has sequenced the virus and identified it as Zika virus. Assuming that the reference laboratories confirm the identity of the virus as Zika, diagnostic laboratories throughout the Americas will need to include Zika virus diagnostic tests in their battery of tests.

[Nobody can say I brought it to Brazil (I live in Rio de Janeiro) because I worked only with the African serotype -- see a paper I co-authored in 1964 in the Bulletin of WHO: Twelve isolations of Zika virus from Aedes (Stegomyia) africanus (Theobald) taken in and above a Uganda forest
