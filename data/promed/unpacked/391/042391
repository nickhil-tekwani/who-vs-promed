Another case of measles confirmed at Northwest Medical Center
-------------------------------------------------------------
A 2nd case of measles -- a highly contagious airborne disease -- at
Northwest Medical Center has been confirmed. The case is linked to a
previous case, which was traced to a tourist from Switzerland who was
at the Northwest emergency room on 12 and 13 Feb 2008, according to a
Pima County Health Department news release.

The 2nd case was a patient in the emergency room at Northwest, 6200
N. La Cholla Blvd., on 12 or 13 Feb 2008 who was later diagnosed with
measles, readmitted and treated in isolation between 24 and 26 Feb 2008.

If you spent time at Northwest during that time and are unsure of
your immunity to measles, health officials recommend you limit
contact with others until 18 Mar 2008, during which time the illness
could develop. If you develop symptoms -- high fever, red eyes, runny
nose and cough followed by a rash, call your doctor or health-care center.

[This is another instance of transmission of measles virus infection
to a susceptible (presumably unvaccinated) individual attending a
health-care facility for other treatments. Parents and their
offspring who have declining measles vaccination should be aware of
this hazard. - Mod.CP]
