UNDIAGNOSED DISEASE, CARDAMOM - BHUTAN

At this time of year, villages in Tendu gewog [administrative group
of villages], about 72 km (45 mi) from Samtse town, are busy drying
fresh cardamom pods. It's a specialised and gruelling task. Tendu
gewog borders southern Darjeeling district. It still produces a good
amount of cardamom at a time when neighbouring villagers are facing
dwindling production. Cardamom sale is still, after mandarin, a major
source of cash income for people of the Sibsoo sub-district.
According to old timers like Chandra Bahadur, 62, although the people
of the gewog managed to produce consistently the same amount for
almost 5 years or so, the production has dropped significantly. "Each
household produced about 30 sacks of cardamom some 15 years ago,"
said Chandra Bahadur. "Some strange disease is gradually wiping out
our cardamom plantation. The medicines agriculture officials gave us
were ineffective."
The severity of the disease is already being felt in Biru, which
earlier depended entirely on cardamom for cash income and supposedly
produced the most then. The farmers complain that production has
dropped by nearly 50 percent over the years. The 37-year-old Biru
mayor, KR Ghalley, said that 4 years ago his gewog produced more than
600 sacks of cardamom, each sack weighing about 50 kg (110 lb).
Today, he says, the entire gewog reaps 300 sacks.
Santa Bir, 52, a farmer from Biru explained that the yield was good
when the fruit was planted on fresh soil every year, amidst trees
which protected it from the direct rays of the sun, with ample warmth
and moisture. "Plant the fruit in the same soil and the leaves turn
white and the fruit is infested with ant-like insects, which damage
more than 10 kg (22 lb) every year," he said, adding that agriculture
officials had advised the villagers to uproot all harvested cardamom
and leave it uncultivated for about 5 years. "But leaving acres of
soil barren deprives us of our livelihood," he said.
Villagers normally sold cardamom to local businessmen and
contractors, who took the fruit to Phuentsholing auction yard or
straight across the border to India. Most supplies came from Biru.
The production, however, has drastically gone down and so has the
price and demand for cardamom. Bhutan Trade Statistics' records of
cardamom exports to India and Bangladesh for the last 5 years
(2002-2006) show that cardamom export dropped radically since 2002
from about 18 430 metric tonnes (MT) to 615 MT in 2006.

[Large, or black, cardamom (_Amomum subulatum_; _Zingiberaceae_) is
native to the Eastern Himalayas growing in cool, moist forest areas.
It is a clustering plant with flower buds appearing from the base of
the rhizome. Black cardamom is an important commercial crop in parts
of India (Darjeeling hills), Bhutan, Sikkim, and Nepal. Typically,
cultivation occurs in woodland areas with overhead shade and access
to regular irrigation.
Cardamom plantations in Bhutan have been reported to be affected by 3
main diseases:
1. Wilt disease caused by the soil-borne fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_.
The disease appears to be spreading and is increasingly causing
economic damage. Symptoms are chlorosis or collapse of the older
leaves, necrosis of the heart leaf, vascular discolouration,
blackening of roots, and eventually death of the plant. The
productivity of infected fields has been declining rapidly resulting
in abandonment of the plantations 1-2 years after infection and a
drastic reduction in cardamom production in Bhutan. Wilt is difficult
to control. Disease management includes replanting with resistant
varieties and cultural practices.
2. Foorkey disease caused by a nanovirus tentatively named Cardamom
bushy dwarf virus. Leaves of infected plants are reduced in size,
lightly curled and pale green in colour. Numerous small tillers
appear at the base of the affected plants forming bushy clumps.
Plants become stunted, fail to give any yield and gradually die.
3. Chirkey or yellow mosaic disease caused by _Cardamom mosaic virus_
(genus _Macluravirus_, _Potyviridae_). Symptoms are mosaic on young
leaves with pale streaks, which slowly turn brown. Growth rate and
yield decline until plants die.
Both viruses are transmitted by infected plant material (including
suckers used for new plantings) and aphid species, which are found in
most cardamom plantations. Chirkey is also transmitted mechanically
through knives used for harvesting and is reported to spread faster
than foorkey. Both viruses can cause considerable crop losses,
however, resistant cultivars are available. Vector control may also
be used in disease management.
Other problems due to insect pests, other fungi, bacterial diseases,
or declining yields due to ageing plantations are also occasionally
reported in this crop in Bhutan. From the information given above,
there appears to be a site-related component, which may point towards
the soil-borne wilt fungus or virus-infected plants remaining from a
previous crop. The 'white leaves' may be symptoms of wilt or the
viruses. The insects described may be aphids, which serve as virus
vectors, or they may be secondary pests (for example thrips which may
appear 'ant-like').
There is also another type of cardamom (_Elettaria cardamomum_;
_Zingiberaceae_) called small, lesser, true, Malabar, or green
cardamom, which is an Indian native growing in tropical areas. Both
black and green cardamom are highly prized spices.
