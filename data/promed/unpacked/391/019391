Influenza-associated pediatric mortality and the increase of _Staph.
aureus_ co-infection
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is requesting that
states report all cases of influenza-related pediatric mortality from the
2006-2007 influenza season.
Since 2004, the Influenza-Associated Pediatric Mortality Surveillance
System, part of the Nationally Notifiable Disease Surveillance System, has
collected information on deaths among children due to laboratory-confirmed
influenza, including the presence of other medical conditions and bacterial
infections at the time of death.
From 1 Oct 2006 through 7 May 2007, 55 deaths from influenza in children
were reported to CDC from 23 state health departments and 2 city health
departments. Data on bacterial co-infections were reported for 51 cases; 20
(39 per cent) had a bacterial co-infection, and 16/20 were infected with
_Staphylococcus aureus_. While the number of pediatric influenza associated
deaths is similar to that reported during the 2 previous years, there has
been an increase in the number of deaths in which both influenza and
pneumonia or bacteremia due to _S. aureus_ were identified. Only one
influenza and _S. aureus_ co-infection was identified in 2004-2005, and 3
were identified in 2005-2006.
Of the 16 children reported with _S. aureus_ so far in 2006-2007, 11 had
methicillin-resistant (MRSA) isolated from a sterile site (9) or sputum
(2), and 5 had methicillin-susceptible _S. aureus_ (MSSA) isolated from a
sterile site (3) or sputum (2). The median age of children with _S. aureus_
co-infection was older than that of children without _S. aureus_
co-infection (11 years versus 4 years, p less than .01) Children with
influenza and _S. aureus_ co-infections were reported to be in good health
before illness onset but progressed rapidly to severe illness. Influenza
strains isolated from these children have not been different from common
strains circulating in the community and the MRSA strains have been typical
of those associated with MRSA skin infection outbreaks in the US.
Health care providers should be alerted to the possibility of bacterial
co-infection among children with influenza, and request bacterial cultures
when bacterial co-infection is suspected. Clinicians, clinical agencies,
and medical examiners are asked to contact their local or state health
department as soon as possible when deaths among children due to laboratory
confirmed influenza are identified.
CDC requests that all cases of pediatric influenza-associated deaths be
reported promptly by state health departments to CDC through
<http://sdn.cdc.gov> and that information about bacterial pathogens
isolated from sterile sites and/or from sputum or endotracheal aspirates be
completed on the Influenza-Associated Pediatric Mortality Surveillance
System case report form.
If the influenza death was complicated by _S. aureus_ infection, please
contact the clinical agency to determine if the _S. aureus_ isolate is
available. CDC is interested in receiving _S. aureus_ isolates to better
characterize those from fatal cases of influenza in children.
