This is a response to the [previous ProMED-mail posting regarding canine
brucellosis [cited above.
Back in the 70s, when I was working veterinary public health for the
Florida Department of Health & Rehabilitative Services, I initiated a
series of studies on canine brucellosis following a human case that
occurred in Jacksonville. Those serologic studies were 1) survey of dogs in
animal shelters across the state, 2) survey of animal shelter personnel, 3)
survey of practicing veterinarians, 4) survey of Florida residents whose
sera were being tested for viral neurological agents, and 5) a multi-state,
multi-species survey of wildlife. All tests were done using an
agglutination test developed by the USDA in Ames and with reagents provided
by that laboratory.
Ten (3.65%) of 274 pound dogs had titers >= 200 and 5 of 770 wildlife sera
were positive (1 raccoon from Florida, 1 bobcat and 2 coyotes from Texas,
and 1 red fox from New York) . Among humans, 1 of 167 animal shelter
workers, 0 of 43 veterinarians, and 1 (0.3%) state residents were positive,
All of these studies have been published.
