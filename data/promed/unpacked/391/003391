Sixty-four people have been hospitalized with an acute intestinal infection
in Mezhdurechensk, a Siberian mining town. One hundred twenty
Mezhdurechensk residents have requested medical aid, a spokesman for the
Emergencies Ministry headquarters told Itar-Tass on Wednesday.
A group of epidemiologists have arrived in Mezhdurechensk from Kemerovo

of the infection's outbreak.
