South Africa identifies so-called skin-worm in northwest region
-----------------------------------------------
South Africa announced on Wed 1 Feb 2006 that it had identified a
"skin-worm" sickness that had broken out in the Mafikeng area, about
900 km northwest of Johannesburg.
The Northwest provincial health department said that the condition is
cutaneous myiasis, a skin condition caused by _Cordylobia
anthropophaga_ (tumbu fly, mango fly, putsi fly).
The department said the fly was widely found in Africa, and dogs and
rodents were the usual hosts. Humans were accidental hosts. Although
it is not usually found in the northwest province, it is found in
other parts of South Africa, such as Limpopo, Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal.
Provincial health spokesman Tebogo Lekgethwane said: "It is related
to the weather pattern and is common in the low-veld, in hot humid
areas." The department reported on Tuesday [31 Jan 2006] that the
sickness had hit several villages around Mafikeng.
People come to clinics complaining that their body is itching. Within
3 days, small sores develop. A yellow spot then develops from each
sore as it gets ripe. Once the sore is expressed, a worm (larva or
maggot of _C. anthropophaga_) comes out of it. Lekgethwane said the
Communicable Disease Control Unit had consulted widely regarding the
outbreak. It and other reliable sources, including the parasitology
unit of the National Institute of Communicable Diseases, agreed that
it was cutaneous myiasis.
A female fly lays eggs on clothes or soil contaminated with urine or
feces. The larvae that emerge from the eggs penetrate the skin
painlessly. An enlarging papule (small pimple), resembling a boil,
develops over about 6 days. Eventually, the larva is large enough for
close examination to reveal small dark lines with pus in the center.
The department said treatment consisted of covering the lesion with
Vaseline or liquid paraffin, which suffocates the larva. Treatment
should be left on for 30 minutes to an hour, and then the larva
should be pushed out via finger pressure. It said that attempts to
removal the larva by instruments may rupture the larva and cause
severe inflammation.
Although the ironing of clothes would kill any eggs laid on them,
washing should not be laid on the ground to dry.

[This interesting report confirms that the cause of this infection
was indeed myiasis caused by the Tumbu fly (see archive number
20060203.0351). It might be added that, usually, the larvae in humans
are found mainly on the trunk. Although pus is mentioned coming from
the boil-like swellings, this is not usually the case, unless
scratching has resulted in secondary bacterial infections. - Mod.MS]
[If one is interested in seeing a variety of images of myiasis, one
can use the google search engine for 'images', and put "myiasis" as
the search term. - Mods. JW/MPP]
