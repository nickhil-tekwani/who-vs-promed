Nairobi
Cholera under control
--------------------------
23 Oct 1998
By Nation Correspondent
Nairobi - An outbreak of cholera which killed 17 people at Kalokol on
the shores of Lake Turkana has been brought under control.
The Rift Valley provincial medical officer, Dr Kenneth Chebet, said
no more deaths had been reported in the last one week since the
outbreak in September. He said 369 cases had been attended to in the
last one month. Out of the 20 patients admitted to Kalokol health
centre last week, he said, only four were still at the hospital and
they were improving.
Staff from the African Medical and Research Foundation (Amref) had
airlifted medical supplies to augment government efforts in the
affected areas and to give medical assistance.
Chiefs' meetings have been held at Kainak, Loichar, Lodwar,
Lokichoggio and Kakuma where clinical officers advised residents on
how to curb the spread of the disease.
[This remote part of Kenya borders on Uganda, South Sudan and
Ethiopia, and the people are nomadic herders, so the possibility of
cross-border spread is high - Mod.JW
