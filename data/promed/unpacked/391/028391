WHO advice for international traffic in relation to the SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant (B.1.1.529) (updated with correction)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The World Health Organization (WHO) has designated the variant B.1.1.529 a variant of concern (VOC), named omicron, on the basis of advice from WHO's Technical Advisory Group on Virus Evolution (hereafter referred to as TAG-VE) on 26 Nov 2021. Following the group's announcement, an increasing number of countries are introducing temporary travel measures, including temporarily prohibiting the arrival of international travellers from Southern African countries and others where the new variant is being detected, including from South Africa, which first reported the variant to WHO on 24 Nov 2021 (https://bit.ly/3I47T1A).

WHO commends South Africa and Botswana for their capacities in surveillance and sequencing and for the speed and transparency with which they notified and shared information with the WHO Secretariat on the omicron variant in accordance with the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR). These actions have allowed other countries to rapidly adjust their response measures in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. WHO calls on all countries to follow the IHR (2005) and to show global solidarity in rapid and transparent information sharing and in a joint response to omicron (as with all other variants), leveraging collective efforts to advance scientific understanding and sharing the benefits of applying newly acquired scientific knowledge and tools.

As noted in the WHO announcement, the omicron variant has a large number of mutations, some of which are concerning. Preliminary evidence suggests an increased risk of reinfection with this variant as compared to other VOCs. Current SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) diagnostics continue to be effective in detecting this variant. A technical brief on the latest information on omicron can be found here: https://bit.ly/32KERE1.

It is expected that the omicron variant will be detected in an increasing number of countries as national authorities step up their surveillance and sequencing activities. WHO is closely monitoring the spread of the omicron variant, and studies are ongoing to understand more about these mutations and their impact on transmissibility, virulence, diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines. The TAG-VE will continue to evaluate the omicron variant, and WHO will communicate new findings with IHR States Parties and the public as needed.

While scientific research is underway to understand how the variant behaves, WHO advises the following:

- Countries should continue to apply an evidence-informed and risk-based approach when implementing travel measures in accordance with the IHR, including the latest Temporary Recommendations (https://bit.ly/3obhtYt) issued by the WHO Director-General on 26 Oct 2021 following the 9th Emergency Committee for COVID-19 and as recommended in the documents WHO policy and technical considerations for implementing a risk-based approach to international travel in the context of COVID-19 issued in July 2021 (https://bit.ly/32KFdul).

- National authorities in countries of departure, transit and arrival may apply a multi-layered risk mitigation approach to potentially delay and/or reduce the exportation or importation of the new variant. Such measures may include screening of passengers prior to travelling and/or upon arrival, including via the use of SARS-CoV-2 testing or the application of quarantine to international travellers. These measures, nonetheless, need to be defined following a thorough risk assessment process informed by the local epidemiology in departure and destination countries and by the health system and public health capacities in the countries of departure, transit and arrival. All measures should be commensurate with the risk, time-limited and applied with respect to travellers' dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms, as outlined in the IHR (2005).

- Blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread, and they place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods. In addition, they can adversely impact global health efforts during a pandemic by disincentivizing countries to report and share epidemiological and sequencing data. All countries should ensure that the measures are regularly reviewed and updated when new evidence becomes available on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of omicron or any other VOC.

- Any travel-related risk mitigation measures should be part of an overall national response strategy which, for VOCs, includes the following, in line with the announcement published on 26 Nov 2021:

* Enhancing surveillance and sequencing efforts to better understand circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants, not only among travellers, but also within the community
* Submitting complete genome sequences and associated metadata to a publicly available database, such as GISAID
* Reporting initial cases/clusters associated with VOC infection to WHO through the IHR mechanism
* Where capacity exists and in coordination with the international community, performing field investigations and laboratory assessments to improve understanding of the potential impacts of the VOC on COVID-19 epidemiology and severity, effectiveness of public health and social measures, diagnostic methods, immune responses, antibody neutralization or other relevant characteristics
* Continue to calibrate national public health and social measures according to the changing epidemiological situation and national systems' capacities to reduce COVID-19 circulation overall, including at points of entry, using a risk-based and scientific approach.

- Since the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, WHO has been monitoring the international travel measures implemented by countries and sharing this information with National IHR Focal Points via the Event Information Site (EIS). As of 28 Nov 2021, 56 countries were reportedly implementing travel measures aimed at potentially delaying the importation of the new variant. Countries should continue sharing their public health rationale and relevant scientific information for additional health measures with WHO under the provisions of Article 43 of the IHR (2005).

- Essential international travel -- including travel for emergency and humanitarian missions, travel of essential personnel, repatriations and cargo transport of essential supplies -- should continue to be prioritized at all times during the COVID-19 pandemic.

- In addition, all travellers should be reminded to remain vigilant for signs and symptoms of COVID-19, to get vaccinated when it is their turn and to adhere to public health and social measures at all times and, regardless of vaccination status, including by using masks appropriately, respecting physical distancing, following good respiratory etiquette and avoiding crowded and poorly ventilated spaces. Persons who are unwell, or who have not been fully vaccinated or do not have proof of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and are at increased risk of developing severe disease and dying, including people 60 years of age or older or those with comorbidities that present increased risk of severe COVID-19 (e.g., heart disease, cancer and diabetes) should be advised to postpone travel to areas with community transmission (this paragraph was revised to align with Technical considerations for implementing a risk-based approach to international travel in the context of COVID-19: Interim guidance, 2 Jul 2021).

[WHO and many scientists have warned against travel bans, yet 56 countries have implemented such measures. The omicron variant has already spread globally. Furthermore, as has been stated, travel bans present a major disincentive for countries to be open when they detect new variants of SARS-CoV-2 or completely new viruses. And it may even encourage countries not to sequence their samples. - Mod.LK]

[2] Netherlands: omicron detected earlier than thought
[A] BBC
Date: Tue 30 Nov 2021
Source: BBC News [edited]
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-59473131


The new COVID-19 variant, omicron, was present in the Netherlands earlier than previously thought, officials say. It was identified in 2 test samples taken in the country between 19 and 23 Nov 2021, which is before the variant was first reported by South Africa. It is not clear whether those who took the tests had visited southern Africa.

It was previously thought that 2 flights that arrived from South Africa on Sunday [28 Nov 2021] had brought the 1st cases of the variant to the Netherlands. Fourteen people on the flights to the capital, Amsterdam, tested positive for omicron, among 61 passengers who were found to have coronavirus.

However, while the 2 new samples reveal omicron was in the Netherlands earlier than thought, they do not predate the cases in southern Africa. The variant was first found in a specimen collected on 9 Nov 2021, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

Early evidence suggests omicron has a higher re-infection risk. But scientists say it will take about 3 weeks before it is known how the heavily mutated variant impacts on the effectiveness of vaccines.

"In a special PCR test, the samples showed an abnormality in the spike protein," the National Institute for Public Health (RIVM), which announced the earlier cases, said on Tuesday [30 Nov 2021]. "This raised the concern that the omicron variant...might be involved. [Health officials] will notify the people involved and start source and contact tracing," it said.

The RIVM also said that a number of different strains of omicron were found among the passengers on board the 2 flights on Sunday [28 Nov 2021]. "This means that the people were very probably infected independently from each other, from different sources and in different locations," a spokesman said.

It's unlikely we will ever know precisely when or where omicron first emerged.

South Africa alerted the world to the new variant on 24 Nov 2021 after it found its 1st case. Since then, other countries have been on the lookout for it, and more cases have been identified around the globe thanks to genome sequencing tests.

Not every nation has the ability, however, to carry out these added checks. Even the UK, which is one of the front-runners using the technology, is unable to screen every positive COVID case to determine which variant is the cause. PCR tests, meanwhile, can hint if a COVID case might be omicron, but cannot confirm it for sure.

Dutch authorities, meanwhile, are also seeking to contact and test thousands of passengers who have travelled from South Africa, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia and Zimbabwe. The US, Canada, the UK and the EU have all restricted travel from southern Africa amid concern over the new variant.

But the UN Secretary General António Guterres said he was "deeply concerned" about the isolation of southern Africa, adding that "the people of Africa cannot be blamed for the immorally low level of vaccinations available."

Omicron was in the Netherlands before South Africa alerted the world.... The Dutch announcement Tuesday [30 Nov 2021] further muddies the timeline on when the new variant actually emerged. Previously, the Dutch had said they first found the variant among passengers who came from South Africa on Friday [26 Nov 2021], but these new cases predate that.

Authorities in the eastern German city of Leipzig, meanwhile, said Tuesday [30 Nov 2021] they had confirmed an infection with the omicron variant in a 39-year-old man who had neither been abroad nor had contact with anyone who had been, news agency dpa reported. Leipzig is in the eastern state of Saxony, which currently has Germany's highest overall coronavirus infection rates.

Meanwhile, Japan and France announced their 1st cases of the new variant on Tuesday [30 Nov 2021].

French authorities confirmed its presence in the French island territory of Reunion in the Indian Ocean. Patrick Mavingui, a microbiologist at the island's research clinic for infectious diseases, said the person who has tested positive for the new variant is a 53-year-old man who had traveled to Mozambique and stopped in South Africa before returning to Reunion. The man was placed in quarantine. He has "muscle pain and fatigue," Mavingui said, according to public television Reunion 1ere.

A day after banning all foreign visitors as an emergency precaution against the variant, Japan also confirmed its 1st case, in a visitor who had traveled from Namibia. A government spokesperson said the patient, a man in his 30s, tested positive upon arrival at Narita airport on Sunday [28 Nov 2021] and was isolated and is being treated at a hospital.

Travel bans also continued to fall Tuesday [30 Nov 2021]. Cambodia barred entry to travelers from 10 African countries, citing the threat from the variant. The move came just 2 weeks after Cambodia reopened its borders to fully vaccinated travelers.

While it has urged against border closures, the WHO has stressed that while scientists are hunting evidence to better understand this variant, countries should accelerate vaccinations as quickly as possible. WHO said there are "considerable uncertainties" about the omicron variant. But it said preliminary evidence raises the possibility that the variant has mutations that could help it both evade an immune-system response and boost its ability to spread from one person to another.

Despite the global worry, doctors in South Africa are reporting patients are suffering mostly mild symptoms so far. But they warn that it is early and most of the new cases are in people in their 20s and 30s, who generally do not get as sick from COVID-19 as older patients.

[The omicron variant is now global and likely was spreading before it was even detected in South Africa. It will be difficult to determine where the mutations originated, but in order to prevent further mutations, it is essential that a greater proportion of the global population get vaccinated, particularly in countries with low vaccine coverage. The more the virus replicates, the greater the chance of new mutations. - Mod.LK]

In an update, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said 44 cases have now been detected by 11 European Union and European Economic Area countries, and so far, the majority had a history of travel to African countries. For cases with known clinical information, all infections were asymptomatic or mild.

England reported 8 more cases, bringing its total to 13. Also the UK's Health Security Agency (HSA) said Scotland has reported 9 cases. Jenny Harries, the HSA's chief executive, said officials expect to find more cases in the days ahead as investigations and contact tracing ramp up.

In response to omicron variant emergence, UK experts are now recommending booster shots for everyone older than 18, and the government has implemented a mask mandate for public transport as well as shops, banks, and beauty parlors. Elsewhere, Canada reported 3 more cases, including 2 from Ottawa and one from Quebec, bringing its total to 5.

Though scientists don't have definitive answers about how well COVID-19 vaccines will protect against the omicron variant with its large number of mutations, some of them concerning, officials from 2 vaccine companies signaled that existing ones might not be as effective and may need updated versions.

Moderna's Chief Executive Officer Stephane Bancel today [30 Nov 2021] told the Financial Times that based on his initial talks with scientists, current vaccines might not protect as well as they did against delta and that it may take months to make variant-specific vaccines. His comments prompted financial market drops in the United States, Europe, and Asia, according to the Washington Post.

Meanwhile, his counterpart at Pfizer, Albert Bourla, on Twitter today [30 Nov 2021] said following the company's experience with the beta and delta variants, scientists came up with an approach to develop and produce variant versions of the vaccine in about 100 days, if needed. "Still, we believe that the best hedge against spread of the omicron variant and any new variant that may emerge is getting all eligible people fully vaccinated and boosted, as recommended," he said.

Regeneron, maker of a monoclonal antibody treatment for COVID-19, said in a statement today [30 Nov 2021] that though there's no direct evidence evaluating the impact of its treatment against the omicron variant, it has some concerns. It said earlier that in vitro analysis and modeling of individual mutations present in omicron point to possible reductions in neutralization activity, both vaccine-induced and from monoclonal antibodies.

Though the world focused on the omicron variant threat, the battle against delta-driven surges continues, especially in Europe.

- The Netherlands is reporting a record weekly high for COVID-19 cases and is working to boost the number of intensive care unit (ICU) beds, according to Reuters (https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/dutch-icu-beds-running-out-weekly-covid-19-cases-hit-record-high-2021-11-30/).

- Greece today [30 Nov 2021] announced that it would make COVID-19 vaccination mandatory for those older than 60, the 1st [country] in Europe to target an age-group (https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/greece-make-vaccinations-persons-over-60-mandatory-pm-2021-11-30/).

- Danish officials said the country's COVID-19 surge shows signs of stabilization, likely helped by a rise in vaccine uptake and booster doses (https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/denmarks-coronavirus-epidemic-is-more-stable-health-minister-says-2021-11-30/).

[3] Long COVID
[A] Chronic fatigue

Many COVID-19 survivors experience impaired circulation, abnormal breathing patterns, and chronic fatigue syndrome an average of 9 months after diagnosis, finds a small, single-center study yesterday [29 Nov 2021] in JACC: Heart Failure (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213177921004807).

In the 1st study to link long-haul COVID-19 with chronic fatigue syndrome, researchers from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai used cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) and symptom reports to find the causes of shortness of breath in 23 women and 18 men with long-haul COVID. Shortness of breath is a common symptom in the roughly 20% of COVID-19 survivors with long-haul COVID, the authors noted. All participants had normal lung function tests, chest x-rays, chest computed tomographic scans, and echocardiograms. Average patient age was 45 years.

Mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 59%. Peak VO2 (oxygen uptake) averaged 20.3 milliliters per kilogram per minute (77% of predicted VO2). VE/VCO2 slope (increase in ventilation in response to carbon dioxide [CO2] production) was, on average, 30. PetCO2 (CO2 partial pressure in the arterial blood) at rest was 33.5 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). Twenty-four patients (58.5%) had a peak VO2 less than 80% of predicted. All patients with peak VO2 less than 80% had limited exercise capacity because of poor circulation.

Fifteen of 17 patients with normal peak VO2 had ventilatory abnormalities, including a peak respiratory rate of greater than 55 breaths per minute (3 patients) or dysfunctional breathing (12). Of all patients, 88% (36 patients) had ventilatory abnormalities and dysfunctional breathing (26), increased VE/VCO2 (17), and/or hypocapnia (PetCO2 less than 35 mm Hg) (25). Nineteen patients (46%) met the criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome.

In an American College of Cardiology news release (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/935983, lead study author Donna Mancini, MD, said that COVID-19 survivors may have residual organ damage from their infections: "The CPET results demonstrate several abnormalities including reduced exercise capacity, excessive ventilatory response and abnormal breathing patterns which would impact their normal daily life activities," she said. Mancini said that rapid, abnormally deep, or dysfunctional breathing can be addressed with the use of breathing exercises or retraining.

[More from the American College of Cardiology news release (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/935983):

"Chronic fatigue syndrome is a medical condition that can often occur after a viral infection and cause fever, aching, and prolonged tiredness and depression. Many COVID-19 patients, some who were never hospitalized, have reported persistent symptoms after they recover from their initial COVID-19 diagnosis. These patients have PASC (Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection) but are more commonly referred to as "long-haulers." Severe fatigue, cognitive difficulty, unrefreshing sleep and myalgia (muscle aches and pains) have all been considered major symptoms for PASC patients, which is similar to what researchers saw after the 2005 SARS-CoV-1 epidemic, where 27% of patients fulfilled criteria for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) after 4 years."

"These findings suggest that in a subgroup of long haulers, hyperventilation and/or dysfunctional breathing may underlie their symptoms. This is important as these abnormalities may be addressed with breathing exercises or 'retraining,' said [Donna] Mancini" (Department of Cardiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and lead author of the study). - Mod.LK]

A small but significant percentage of college athletes with COVID-19 develop myocarditis, a potentially dangerous inflammation of the heart muscle, according to a study presented yesterday [29 Nov 2021] at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/935767). Myocarditis typically follows bacterial or viral infections. In college athletes, previous damage and scarring to the heart muscle caused by myocarditis has been linked to up to 20% of sudden athlete deaths.

To conduct the study, researchers looked at 1597 cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exams conducted at the 13 participating schools in the Big Ten Cardiac Registry. Thirty-seven of the college athletes with COVID-19 had myocarditis (2.3%), but 20 of the 37 (54%) had neither cardiac symptoms nor cardiac testing abnormalities.

"Testing patients for clinical symptoms of myocarditis only captured a small percentage of all patients who had myocardial inflammation," said Jean Jeudy, MD, professor and radiologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, in an RSNA press release. "Cardiac MRI for all athletes yielded a 7.4-fold increase in detection." Jeudy said that, in the COVID-19 era, the role of MRI as a screening tool for college athletes needs to be explored.

"'We still don't know the long-term effects,' Dr. Jeudy said. 'Some athletes had issues that resolved within a month, but we also have athletes with continued abnormalities on their MRI as a result of their initial injury and scarring. There are a lot of chronic issues with COVID-19 that we need to know more about, and hopefully this registry can be one of the major parts of getting that information.'" - Mod.LK]
