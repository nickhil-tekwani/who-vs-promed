The Orange County Mosquito Control District's office was notified by the Texas Department of State Health Services that a horse from the Vidor area has tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis. The horse was pastured in the northern part of Vidor, North of I-10 and West of Hwy 105. According to the report received it is not clear whether or not the animal had been vaccinated for EEE and as a result had to be euthanized.

Eastern equine encephalitis more commonly occurs in the eastern part of the United States, as its name implies. Texas is along the outer fringe of the disease's range, but this disease is one that we must be mindful of and monitor for. Horses can become infected with, and die from EEE virus infection. It is also a potential threat to humans with a 1/3 mortality rate, if contracted. It is normally transmitted from bird to mosquito to bird. The bird to bird cycle is typically maintained by the _Culiseta melanura_, species of mosquito that breeds in fresh water swamps. This particular mosquito species generally does not extend out more than 0.5 mi [0.8 km] from its larval site in shaded swamp pools. It is active both in the morning and evening hours. This species rarely bites people or horses. A vaccine for EEE has been available for horses for years. This vaccine is usually given with other vaccinations for diseases, most commonly western equine encephalitis, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, and West Nile virus. There is not a vaccine for humans. Infection in humans is rare, and if contracted treatment usually centers on the symptoms and complications.

Horses are usually kept outdoors 7 days a week, 24 hours a day, so they are exposed to lots of things, one of which are mosquito bites. And our area is going to have mosquitoes. We have a lot of water not only surrounding our area but throughout that breeds mosquitoes and we are going to have to deal with these insects. So, if horses aren't vaccinated then eventually some of them will come down with one of these mosquito-borne diseases.

Although mosquito populations have been low in the area in which the horse was pastured, we have stepped up our spray operations in the immediate and surrounding areas. The Mosquito Control District will continue trapping and collecting mosquitoes from the area to determine whether or not viral activity still exists.

Residents need to protect themselves by taking personal protective measures like avoiding outdoor activity, if possible, when mosquito activity is on the rise and using an EPA approved insect repellent when mosquito activity is present. Always read and follow label directions when using repellents.

Other personal protective measures to reduce exposure to mosquitoes are moving indoors at dust and dawn when many mosquito species are most active, wearing light colored loose fitting clothing as a physical barrier from the mosquito, and draining standing water from property including empty cans, buckets, tires, rain gutters, tree holes, and saucers placed under potted plants regularly. Change water in pet bowls, birdbaths, and wading pools several times a week.

Keep mosquitoes out of your house by making sure that window and door screens are in good condition.

Horse owners should vaccinate their animals annually for eastern, western, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis as well as West Nile virus.

Two horses in Suffolk [County, Virginia] were euthanized after they contracted eastern equine encephalitis (EEE).

Neither of the horses, a male Paint and an Arabian filly, had up-to-date vaccinations.

These cases were the 5th and 6th Virginia has seen in horses this year, according to the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS). The Commonwealth had 4 earlier cases of EEE this year [2016]: 2 others from Suffolk, 1 from Chesapeake, and 1 from Prince George County.

EEE is a mosquito-borne illness that causes inflammation or swelling of the brain and spinal cord. It's also known as the "sleeping sickness."

Signs include impaired vision, aimless wandering, head pressing, circling, inability to swallow, irregular staggering gait, paralysis, convulsions and death. Officials say the disease carries a mortality rate of 80 to 90 percent.

Once a horse has been bitten by an infected mosquito, it may take 3 to 10 days for signs of the disease to appear.

Veterinarians encourage horse owners to get vaccinations for EEE every 6 months. "One of the reasons most veterinarians recommend a 6-month vaccination schedule in Tidewater, Virginia is because of the prevalence of mosquitoes in the area," said Dr Charles Broaddus, State Veterinarian.

Horse owners are encouraged to contact VDACS' Office of the State Veterinarian or consult their local veterinarian for more information about EEE or to report a case.

The [South Carolina] state vet is urging horse owners to vaccinate their horses against a deadly, mosquito-borne disease.

A case of a deadly, mosquito-borne disease that affects horses has been reported in both Berkeley and Dorchester counties.

Eastern equine encephalitis is rare in humans but is nearly always fatal in unvaccinated horses.

As of 12 Aug. 2016, the state Veterinarian's Office had reported 12 cases: 4 in Horry County, 2 in Colleton County, and singular cases in Berkeley, Marion, Dorchester, Kershaw, Greenville and Florence counties.

Signs usually develop in horses from 2 to 5 days after exposure to an infected mosquito. These symptoms include stumbling, circling, head pressing, depression or apprehension, weakness of legs, partial paralysis, inability to stand, muscle twitching or death.

The Berkeley County case was reported in mid-July [2016].

There is a vaccine for EEE and the state vet urges horse owners to get their animals vaccinated. Dr Boyd Parr said that horses that receive the vaccine and contract the virus also stand a higher chance of survival.

South Carolina led the nation in cases of the disease in 2013 with 49 infected horses. Of those, 48 died.

None of the horses infected during 2013 had been vaccinated effectively, according to a review of Livestock-Poultry Health vaccination history. After that outbreak, increased vaccinations helped reduce the number of cases to seven in 2014 and six last year.

"Up until a few weeks ago, we were matching the number we were having at this time of year for 2013," Parr said. He said the mosquito population will "keep building" and spreading the virus from September through November. He said the slowdown might be from horse owners making sure their horses receive the vaccine.

Parr said that, in addition to vaccinating livestock, horse owners should engage in mosquito control around their animals. Rarely, eastern equine encephalitis virus can be transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected mosquito, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Only a few cases are reported in the United States each year.

Most people infected with EEE have no apparent illness. Severe cases of EEE (involving encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain) begin with the sudden onset of headache, high fever, chills and vomiting. The illness may then progress into disorientation, seizures or coma.

According to the CDC, EEE is one of the most severe mosquito-transmitted diseases in the United States with about 33 percent mortality and significant brain damage in most survivors.

Vaccination is very effective in preventing the viral infection. The vaccine is usually a combination of EEE, WNV, WEE and some times VEE and tetanus. Mosquito control is very important in reducing the mosquitos, which is another form of helping to protect your horse.

Protection from EEE can wane in approximately 4 months. Areas with high prevalence would be wise to vaccine every 4 months.

Vaccination schedules for EEE/WEE
---------------------------------
"Adult horses previously vaccinated against EEE/WEE: annual revaccination must be completed prior to vector season in the spring. In animals at high risk or with limited immunity, more frequent vaccination or appropriately timed vaccination is recommended in order to induce protective immunity during periods of likely exposure. In areas where mosquitoes are active year-round, many veterinarians elect to vaccinate horses at 6 month intervals to ensure uniform protection throughout the year, although this practice is not specifically recommended by manufacturers of vaccines.

"Adult horses, previously unvaccinated against EEE/WEE or of unknown vaccination history: administer a primary series of 2 doses with a 3 or 4 to 6 week interval between doses. Revaccinate prior to the onset of the next vector season and annually thereafter.

"Pregnant mares, previously vaccinated against EEE/WEE: vaccinate 4 to 6 weeks before foaling.

"Pregnant mares, unvaccinated or having unknown vaccinal history: immediately begin a 2-dose primary series with a 3 or 4 week interval between doses. Booster at 4 to 6 weeks before foaling or prior to the onset of the next vector season -- whichever occurs first.

"Foals of mares vaccinated against EEE/WEE in the pre-partum period: administer a primary 3-dose series beginning at 4 to 6 months of age. A 3 or 4 to 6 week interval between the 1st and 2nd doses is recommended. The 3rd dose should be administered at 10 to 12 months of age, prior to the onset of the next mosquito season.

"In the south eastern US, due to earlier seasonal disease risk, vaccination may be started at 2 to 3 months of age. When initiating vaccinations in younger foals, a series of 4 primary doses should be administered, with a 3 or 4 week interval between the 1st and 2nd doses and a 4 week interval between the 2nd and 3rd doses. The 4th dose should be administered at 10 to 12 months of age, prior to the onset of the next mosquito season.

"Foals of unvaccinated mares or having unknown vaccinal history: administer a primary series of 3 doses with a 30 day interval between the 1st and 2nd doses and a 60 day [8 week] interval between the 2nd and 3rd doses. The primary series of vaccinations should be initiated at 3 to 4 months of age and, where possible, be completed prior to the onset of the high-risk insect vector season. If the primary series is initiated during the mosquito vector season, an interval of 3 to 4 weeks between the 2nd and 3rd doses is preferable to the interval of 8 weeks described above.

"Horses having been naturally infected and recovered: recovered horses likely develop lifelong immunity. Consider revaccination only if the immune status of the animal changes the risk for susceptibility to infection. Examples of these conditions would include the long-term use of corticosteroids and pituitary adenoma."
