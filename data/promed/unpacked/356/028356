Intensive surveillance activities in the Democratic Republic of Congo's Ebola virus outbreak have turned up 3 more suspected cases in the remote town of Bikoro, according to an update today [27 Jun 2018] from the country's health ministry [see report above].

Tests on earlier reported suspected illnesses have ruled out 2 infections, putting the outbreak total at 57 cases, including 38 confirmed, 15 probable, and 4 suspected cases. The number of people who have died from Ebola remained at 29.

In other outbreak developments, the ministry said the last 51 remaining contacts of the last lab-confirmed cases will complete their 21-day monitoring periods as of midnight tonight [Wed 27 Jun]. Over the response period, health workers have monitored 1706 contacts.

Global health officials have said they are cautiously optimistic that the outbreak has been contained. Vaccination activities continue, and 3330 people have now been immunized with the experimental VSV-EBOV vaccine.

[It has not been discussed at what point the vaccinations would be terminated. As of today, 27 Jun 2018, all contacts are clean, so vaccine is not needed to protect them. Intensive surveillance continues, so perhaps vaccination will proceed for some time in anticipation of new cases. - Mod.LK]

[2] Outbreak situation
- 27 Jun 2018. Outbreak looks like it is contained
[Washington Post, edited]
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/06/27/remember-that-ebola-outbreak-in-congo-looks-like-they-contained-it/
[Byline: Max Bearak]


The most serious outbreak of the Ebola virus since an epidemic devastated West Africa 2 years ago, killed 11 000 people and catapulted the disease back into the global consciousness, is almost assuredly over. Out of an abundance of caution, though, health officials will closely monitor the situation for another 3 weeks before making the final declaration.

As of [Wed 27 Jun 2018], contacts of the last confirmed case of the virus have passed a 21-day incubation period without showing signs of infection. That means that no one who was in contact with an infected person needs to be monitored on a daily basis anymore. A total of 38 cases were confirmed, of which 14 died. Another 15 people most likely died of the disease as well. For the past 3 weeks, all suspected cases have turned out to be negative.

For an Ebola outbreak to be officially declared over, however, 2 incubation periods (a total of 42 days) must pass without any confirmed cases.

And so begins the countdown to the end of Congo's 9th and most worrisome Ebola outbreak. It was declared on 8 May, when a cluster of cases was confirmed deep in the rain forest of the country's Equateur province. Over the next 3 weeks, the virus made its way to Mbandaka, a regional transport hub and city of 1.2 million along the heavily trafficked Congo and Ruki rivers. Ebola is far harder to contain in densely populated urban areas, and the possibility of a traveler contracting the disease and taking it to another part of the country increased greatly.

"This outbreak has been the most challenging and complex outbreak the country has ever had to face, mainly because it started in 2 rural zones at the same time and quickly reached a city of more than 1 million inhabitants directly connected to Kinshasa, our capital city where 12 million Congolese live," Congo's minister of health, Oly Ilunga, told The Washington Post. "Yet thanks to a rapid national and international mobilization as well as a great government-led coordination of the response, we managed to contain this outbreak in just 7 weeks." According to the minister, 1706 contacts of those either confirmed or thought to have contracted Ebola were traced and monitored. Contact tracing, as the process is called, requires establishing of a vast surveillance team to watch people's movements from town to town and reporting any cases of fever that could be Ebola.

That tracing was also used in a new way during this outbreak: to identify candidates for an experimental Ebola vaccine that had only been used once before, in the waning days of the West African epidemic. More than 3300 people ultimately were administered the vaccine, which the health minister referred to as a "game-changer."

Ebola is endemic to Congo's rain forests. Due to its prevalence in the country, Congo's health officials have had more practice than anyone else in containing the virus, and they are generally reputed to be the most skilled at it in the world. But Ebola is not a virus that one simply contains and forgets about.

"As Ebola is a virus whose natural reservoir is located in the Equatorial Forest, we must prepare ourselves for the 10th Ebola outbreak," said Ilunga. "Moreover, with the greater mobility of the population, we can expect to have other outbreaks in urban zones in the future. We must learn the lessons from this response and strengthen our system in order to detect and respond even more efficiently to the next outbreak."

[It is correct that the outbreak may be contained, but suspected cases are still being reported. Therefore, vigilance must be maintained a few weeks longer to be certain the outbreak actually is over. - Mod.LK]

- 26 Jun 2018. Ebola no longer seems to be rampant in DRC
[Media Congo, in French machine trans., edited]
https://www.mediacongo.net/article-actualite-39562_ebola_ne_semble_plus_sevir_en_rdc.html

It has been 20 days since the DRC has notified a new positive case of the disease. A total of 24 people have been cured since the 1st confirmed case. Today [26 Jun 2018], there is optimism on the side of the Ministry of Health which claims to have mastered the situation in the city of Mbandaka and in the health zone of Bhasin.

A total of 55 cases of hemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, of which 38 were confirmed.

The last confirmed case of Ebola disease dates back to 6 Jun 2018. Epidemiological analyses have identified contacts that live in all affected health areas. In the last news, 172 people were always followed. They were advised to limit their movements.

The Ministry of Health indicated that the last contact will come off the list this Wed 27 Jun 2018. The World Health Organization (WHO) talks about important progress, but stresses that the work has not yet been completed and that vigilance must be put in order.

With the epidemic almost under control at Bikoro and Mbandaka, efforts are now being directed towards Itipo. Awareness has also been intensified since last week [week of 18 Jun 2018]. For example, Jean-Florent Ibenge Ikwange, coach of the Leopards, national team of the DRC, travelled to Mbandaka and Itipo to participate in the "Leopards against Ebola" campaign. He was accompanied by the former player of Portugal's national team Aziz Makukula.

The other pillar of the response is vaccination. Since the launch of the targeted campaign on [21 May 2018], 3280 [3330 reported by DRC MoH] people have been vaccinated.

[3] MSF response
- 19 Jun 2018. Crisis update
[Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), edited]
https://www.msf.org/democratic-republic-congo-ebola-update-june-2018


[excerpt:]

Staff on the ground, 19 Jun 2018
--------------------------------
[On 19 Jun 2018] there are 470 people working in the field on the MSF Ebola response in DRC, the vast majority are Congolese and from the affected region.

Supply material, 5 Jun 2018
---------------------------
Supply materials include:
- medical kits
- protection and disinfection kits: isolation items such as gloves, boots and personal protective equipment-PPE, etc.;
- logistic and hygiene kits: plastic sheets, jerry cans, water distribution kits, chlorine spray kits, water treatment kits, etc.;
- drugs;
- transport: cars and motorbikes
- tents and construction material for building ETCs [Ebola treatment centres]

As part of MSF's emergency preparedness in DRC, some supplies were already available in Kinshasa. These were sent to hotspot zones as soon as the outbreak started.

Almost 100 tonnes of supplies (sent from MSF supply centres in Europe) have been received in Kinshasa, and an additional 15 are expected by the end of the week. A total 63 tonnes of supplies (medical and logistical supplies, including 6 vehicles and 10 motorbikes) have already been sent to Mbandaka and Bikoro, with more to be sent in the coming days.

Activities
----------
MSF's Ebola response in DRC started on 5 May 2018, with an epidemiological alert in the Equateur region. A small team from MSF's Congo Emergency Pool (PUC) assessed the situation, together with teams from the MoH and WHO. When the Ebola epidemic was officially declared on 8 May 2018, experts from MSF's emergency pools arrived in the field to deploy a rapid response in the Ebola hotspots. Among the MSF staff on the ground are some our most experienced Ebola field workers, including medical personnel, experts in infection control and logisticians.

Mbandaka
--------
An MSF ETC with 12 beds has been operational in Mbandaka since 28 May. In addition to the treatment and isolation of suspected and confirmed Ebola cases, the focus of MSF's response is on surveillance, investigation of new cases and their contacts, infection control and prevention, health promotion, safe burials and training activities with the MoH staff. Plans for the handover of these activities are under way and will be shared in the coming weeks.

[Handover of the expertise on responding to Ebola virus outbreaks, by MSF to local health care workers is an important step in building of infrastructure, and critical to preparedness of the local population.-Mod LK]

Bikoro
------
In Bikoro, MSF has set up an ETC with 20 beds in partnership with the MOH, and continues to reinforce outreach activities including case investigation, monitoring and surveillance. There are also 2 teams who respond to alerts about suspect and probable cases in the surrounding villages. These activities will be progressively handed over to the MoH and other actors in the coming weeks.

MSF has recently helped to set up a survivor clinic to take care of post Ebola complications and mental health issues amongst those who recovered from Ebola. The clinic will be run by an MoH doctor.

[Survivor clinics are important as survivors had problems following the West African outbreak. But there has been no report yet of sequelae and long term persistence of virus in survivors in the DRC outbreak, and no clear evidence presented for sexual transmission. This may be a numbers game, that is, there were many fewer people infected in the DRC than in West Africa, so low probability events may not be observed. - Mod LK]

Kinkole-Kinshasa
------------------
Construction of a 10-bed (extendable to 40) ETC at Kinkole (Kinshasa suburbs) is finished. MSF staff have been carrying out training (on protection measures, treatment procedures, and transport of patients) to MoH and DPS (provincial health authorities -- Département Provinciale de la Santé) staff, who will manage the structure in case of need.

Itipo
-----
ALIMA [African-Led Humanitarian Response] has finished constructing their Ebola Treatment Centre in Itipo so MSF will close the 14-bed transit centre on [20 Jun 2018]. All future suspect and confirmed cases in Itipo will be cared for by ALIMA and not transferred to MSF in Bikoro. Some of the MSF team from Itipo will finish their mission whilst others will be redeployed to support MSF's teams in Iboko.

MSF is also currently working to set up a survivor clinic in Itipo (the epicentre of the outbreak and the home of most of the survivors) alongside the MoH and ALIMA.

[ALIMA is a medical humanitarian NGO focused on 3 areas: acute crises, such as the Ebola outbreak or conflict in northern Mali; chronic ongoing emergencies, such as constant high levels of malnutrition exacerbated by seasonal malaria; innovation and research, such as clinical trials on Ebola vaccines. Across these focus areas, ALIMA is an emerging leader in the humanitarian community, particularly through its strong commitment to partnership. - Mod LK] (https://elmaphilanthropies.org/stories/alima-african-led-humanitarian-response/)

Iboko
-----
MSF continues to run a 13-bed ETC in the Iboko General Reference Hospital in partnership with the MoH. In addition, MSF teams are also assisting with other areas of the Ebola response, including ambulance services, contact tracing, active cases finding, health structure support, health promotion, safe burial and the disinfection of health centres and houses. MSF is also supporting the paediatric department of the Iboko General Reference Hospital with non-Ebola health care and working alongside MoH staff to improve infection prevention and control in the hospital.

[Although this report is now one week old, it is informative to follow the response to the outbreak by MSF. Their response consisted of 470 people working in the field, most of whom were Congolese. This bodes well for the future in that these individuals are now trained. - Mod.LK
