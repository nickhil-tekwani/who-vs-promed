Madagascar vanilla output may fall
----------------------------------
Vanilla output in Madagascar, the world's 2nd-biggest producer of the
flavorant, may drop 29 percent in 2010 as plummeting prices cut
plantings and amid disease and a low crop cycle. Output may decline
to 1000 metric tons and remain at that level in 2011, compared with
2000 tons in 2008, said Nissi Randriamanana, Vanille Mad SA, which
handles 30 percent of shipments of the crop.

Madagascar is at the end of a 4-year crop cycle when production
usually declines. Plantings have also been curbed by fusarium, a
disease that contaminates the soil around plants and prevents
cultivation of crops, he said.

Vanilla makes up 4.2 percent of Madagascar's exports, according to
the Trade Ministry.

[Root and/or stem rot of vanilla (_Vanilla_ species) caused by the
fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_ f.sp. _vanillae_ is the most significant
disease of the crop and a major constraint to vanilla production
worldwide. For example, it has been reported that all plantings were
lost in Sumatra and about two thirds of those in India. The disease
can completely destroy a plantation within weeks.

The pathogen can survive in infected seedlings as well as in plant
debris in soil for several years. It is soil borne and can also be
spread with contaminated plant and other materials and by mechanical
means (including human activities). Disease management is difficult
due to the inaccessibility of underground plant parts to fungicides.
It usually requires an integrated approach and may include exclusion,
phytosanitation, cultural practices and drenching the soil with
copper fungicides. Biological control methods and resistant vanilla
cultivars are being developed. However, it takes several years before
the 1st crop can be harvested when replanting with resistant
varieties.

In Madagascar, 80 percent of vanilla plantations have been reported
to be affected by fusarium diseases. A serious outbreak of an
undiagnosed soil borne root rot of the crop was reported in 2008
(ProMED-mail post 20081211.3885). While _Phytophthora_ root rots are
also know to occur in the country, it seems likely that the
_Fusarium_ outbreak referred to above may have already been the cause
of the problems in 2008.
