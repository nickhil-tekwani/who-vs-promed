SACROCYSTIS NEURONA IN OPOSSUMS (4)
====================================
Subject: PROMED-AHEAD: Sarcocystis neurona in opossums (3) (fwd)
Ms. Hawkoette;
In response to your comments:
S. neurona is likely the same bug as S. falcatula, and will
eventually be renamed as such, once it is proven to be so.
Therefore, these "two" species cause the same thing, because
they are actually the same species.
S. rileyi does not cause these symptoms, and probably does not
cross species lines like S. falcatula.
The treatment protocol for equine protozoal myelitis (EPM)
has been somewhat standardized at this time, although some
individual veterinarians may vary that protocol for specific
reasons.
Incidently, the same or a related protozoan may actually be
responsible for neurologic disease (and death) of horses, mink,
skunks, raccoons, cats, dogs, sheep, chickens and even a macaque
monkey with SIV (published literature, bibliography available upon
request). Horses are likely to be the most often infected.
I hope that you release your rehabed opossums far from horse
raising properties.
<...re populations at bay where there is feed/hay etc in abundance. I
Actually, opossums probably pose a much greater risk to horses
than any of the other species that you have mentioned. As many
as 10% of horses has been suggested (here, I am quoting Dr. MacKay)
to have EPM. Since this disease is, at worst fatal, and at best
performance limiting in horses, this is a serious impact.
Many, many, many more horses die of EPM than rabies.
BTW, others have suggested that the incidence of EPM could be
even higher. My suggestion is: release your opossums where they
cannot pose this threat to horses, and keep cats in the barn
to discourage the rats and mice (don't feed the cats at night,
or you will get opossums whether you want them or not).
Several facilites have been identified with rates of EPM as high
as 50% of their horses. This not only causes severe distress to
the horses, but also results in a major economic impact to those
individuals. In two of the outbreaks that I have investigated,
opossums were permitted to live in the barns, until the link was
made. One of the farms was owned by a woman who felt that all
the wildlife in the barns resulted in a friendly ecosystem, and
she was quite proud of it. EPM cost this woman well over $10,000
and she no longer permits opossums to live in the barn. Incidently,
she has had no new cases on the farm since eradicating the opossums.
Excellent observation. This is the whole problem. Horses are
not stupid enough to eat opossum, or any other carnivore's feces.
However, once the soft feces are dispersed, the sporocysts remain,
happily viable and waiting for an unsuspecting horse to eat the
blade of grass upon which it sits.
Preliminary research suggests that one opossum can infect as many as
50 horses. (Possibly more)
It sits there happily viable waiting for a host. For that matter
birds can pick it up, and deposit it into your horse's feed,
earthworms can pick it up, a bird can at the earthworm and deposit
it into your horse's feed, and cockroaches can pick it up,
get eaten by birds, who then deposit it in your horse's feed.
In other words, the very argument that you are suggesting that
the fecal material gets spread around is the very reason that
this disease is a very big problem in horses.
Unequivocally, YES. Sunlight may provide some inactivation, but
it would not be complete.
The research that showed that opossums are the culprits was
published in December, 1995 (Journal of parasitology, Fenger et al.,
and Dame et al.). I suspect that the date on your Merck manual
is older than that. As for dogs and cats, that was apparently
a guess, although research from 1989 showed that dogs and cats
were very unlikely sources of infection for horses.
< Can other carnivores/omnivores --
Unequivocally, NO. BTW, the opossum is the primary, or definitive host
and the grackles/cowbirds/pigeons/starlings, etc. are the secondary, or
intermediate host. Horses/mink/chickens, etc. are aberrant intermediate
hosts.
Yes. Float in saturated sucrose. about 11 microns long, 4-5 wide.
<[- Nancy Hawekotte makes an excellent point about faecal consistancy.
As I have pointed out above, rain and other dispersing agents (bugs,
worms, birds, etc) actually contribute to the infection risk, rather
than diminishing it. The only good way to diminish your risk is to
relocate opossums away from horse raising facilities. Perhaps there
will one day be a vaccine.
