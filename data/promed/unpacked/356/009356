----------------------------------------------------------
I just want to make a comment on the status of poultry workers and
veterinarians exposed to avian influenza virus (AIV). We have made most
probably the largest blood sampling campaign among 1000 of our workers and
veterinarians who were exposed to the H5N1 outbreak in 2005 and 2006 and
were involved in culling, stamping out and composting activities in
Indonesia. Blood samples were tested in the WHO-reference lab at Queen Mary
Hospital in Hong Kong, and only 2 workers showed [evidence of] H5N1
infection. [These] blood samples were tested against Indonesian H5N1 virus
isolates from 2005/2006.
I have been told that it is not easy to get infected by H5N1 [avian
influenza virus]. Using HI [haemagglutination inhibition?] test mostly will
give (false) positive results. Please clarify what tests have been used in
the study in the US.

[The data cited by Dr. Prajitno are unique and supported by the general
observation that few people involved in poultry rearing, breeding, and
culling in the H5N1 epidemic areas have been victims of the disease.
ProMED-mail welcomes the opportunity to communicate this information. It is
possible that (as suggested by Dr Prajitno) the outcome of such surveys is
affected by the method of assay and that this may be the reason for the
difference between the American and the Indonesian results. ProMED-mail
does not yet have access to the July issue of Clinical Infectious Diseases
and cannot inform Dr Prajitno of the assay procedure used in the American
study. We hope that an interested reader will be able to respond to his
request. - Mod.CP]
