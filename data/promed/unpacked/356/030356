Residents of a central Indiana county have reported nearly 100 dead deer in what wildlife officials believe might be a disease outbreak.

An Indiana Department of Natural Resources biologist says most of those dead deer have been found in southern Putnam County. Biologist Dean Zimmerman tells the Banner Graphic that 17 counties around the state have had suspected cases of epizootic hemorrhagic disease among deer, although Putnam County seems to have a large outbreak.

The illness is a viral disease transmitted by small flies that typically occurs during late summer and early fall. It doesn't affect humans. Zimmerman says the flies that carry the disease reproduce more successfully in dry weather and that it will take a killing frost to end the outbreak.

Wild white-tailed deer in 17 Michigan counties are reportedly infected by epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD), according to officials with the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) and Michigan State University's (MSU) Diagnostic Center for Population and Animal Health (DPAH).

EHD is contracted most often by wild white-tailed deer, but was reported in domesticated deer in 2006. It is not transmissible to humans, but is an acute, infectious, and fatal disease caused by biting midges, which primarily impacts cervids (deer), a news release stated.

"This is not a coincidence," said State Veterinarian Dr Steven L Halstead. "Owners of cervid (deer) facilities should make themselves aware of EHD cases occurring in wild white-tailed deer in Michigan and other states and take measures to manage biting insects around these valuable animals."

EHD is transmitted via blood feeding midges. The disease cannot be transmitted from one animal to another by direct contact, a news release stated. EHD is typically detected in wild white-tailed deer in late summer and early fall. Large die offs of up to 100 animals have been reported, often near water because EHD causes high fever and dehydration, MDARD warned. Deer will appear sluggish, lame, confused, and unresponsive to humans. At times, the deer may even have discharge from the nose and sores in their mouths along with a swollen tongue.

The 17 counties affected include: Allegan, Barry, Berrien, Branch, Calhoun, Cass, Clinton, Eaton, Gratiot, Ionia, Jackson, Kent, Montcalm, Muskegon, Ottawa, Shiawassee, and St Joseph, the MDARD stated. Two privately owned cervid (POC) facilities in Barry and Ionia Counties have confirmed cases.

The disease, epizootic hemorrhagic disease [EHD], increases the pulse, respiration rates, and body temperature of white-tailed deer before they enter a shock-like state and die. Deer usually exhibit these symptoms roughly a week after exposure.

According to 28 Aug 2012 report from the Michigan Department of Natural Resources [DNR], 1762 total white-tailed deer have been infected by EHD. Most of the cases are confined to Michigan's southern counties. The Ionia County deer population has been hit particularly hard by the virus, with over 1100 confirmed deaths from EHD. More than 200 deer have been reported dead from the disease inside Ionia County lines for each of the past 4 weeks. Branch County has seen the 2nd-biggest EHD outbreak, with 225 confirmed infections from EHD. Clinton County has confirmed 153 cases of EHD, though 97 cases were observed in the DNR's latest report alone. Calhoun, Gratiot, Barry, Allegan, and Cass counties have all confirmed double-digit deer deaths from EHD infections, and several other counties have seen a small number of infected deer.

According to the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, there is no known treatment for the disease, though there is no evidence that would suggest humans can be infected. The disease is transmitted by insects carrying the virus. No other source of transmission is known except for a bite from a biological vector. The most common vector, the insect _Culicoides variipennis_, dies off come late autumn. The DNR expects the disease to die abruptly after the swarming insects fail to outlast the frost.

An estimated 2150 deaths in the Michigan white-tailed deer population have been observed since 1955. This year's [2012] outbreak has already accounted for more than 80 percent of that number. The DNR stated that EHD can have a significant effect on a local deer population, though statewide decreases of population have never been observed.

Other symptoms infected deer exhibit include loss of appetite, weakness, salivation, and unconsciousness. Those killed by the virus are often found by bodies of water to soothe themselves from fever.

[EHD is the most important disease of white-tailed deer. Outbreaks are common in the southeast USA. According item [3] above, deaths in Michigan are at higher levels than usual, which may be cause for concern.
