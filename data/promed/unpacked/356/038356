2 ostriches at a farm in Hwange, Matabeleland North, have reportedly
contracted a suspected strain of the dangerous bird flu virus in the
country's 2nd such case in recent weeks.
Contacted by our sources for comment yesterday [25 Oct 2006],
Department of Veterinary Services director, Stuart Hargreaves, could
not immediately confirm the outbreak. But he also could not rule it
out completely as the province was on alert following a similar
outbreak in nearby Victoria Falls and Livingstone in Zambia [see refs. below].
"There was an outbreak in that province recently, the new suspected
cases have not been reported to us, but we had some cases in Victoria
Falls and Livingstone, Zambia where some birds were quarantined," he said.
Hargreaves said he was yet to find out from officials on the ground
in Hwange on the exact situation. Farmers in Hwange and Victoria
Falls confirmed the suspected outbreak and are already on high alert.
"We have reported the case to the veterinary department who promised
to carry out tests to establish what it is," said Samuel Dube who
spoke by phone from Deka Mouth in Hwange. "I suspect one of my birds
(Ostriches) has avian flu, I have called the veterinary department
before I could put it down," he said.
Dube said the strain suffered by one of his birds could be avian flu,
as he had seen such symptoms before on quarantined ostriches in
Zambia during the recent outbreak. However Hargreaves downplayed the
fears saying the department has intensified efforts to prevent a
deadly outbreak.
He said: "At the moment, the situation is calm and we have since
resumed ostrich meat, chicken and eggs exports regionally, but we are
monitoring any suspected cases of outbreaks."
Hargreaves also chairs the national taskforce on avian flu mandated
to put in place all necessary measures to detect the influenza virus
early. One way of containing the highly contagious outbreak would be
tightening restrictions on the movement of poultry and poultry
products across the country.

[Confirmation of the suspected cases in ostriches -- or otherwise --
will be appreciated. Results of laboratory tests are anticipated.
South Africa reported several outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian
influenza (HPAI), virus subtype H5N2, in ostriches, during July 2006.
The last official report was received on 4 Aug 2006, notifying the
confirmation of 2 outbreaks in the Western Cape province. (OIE
follow-up report No. 3,

ProMED has not seen any confirmation of the outbreaks in wild birds
-- not ostriches -- in Zambia in June 2006 (see refs. below). - Mod.JW]
