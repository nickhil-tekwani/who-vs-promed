Bluetongue disease hits Swedish farm
------------------------------------
Two animals infected with bluetongue disease have been destroyed, as
Sweden's agricultural ministry gears up to prevent a wider outbreak
of the feared livestock disease.

A total of 81 municipalities are to be affected by restrictions.

The 1st 2 cases of bluetongue disease were discovered in western
Sweden on Sat [6 Sep 2008] in a livestock herd about 10 km (6.2 mi)
east of Halmstad.

The farm has around 300 animals and results from tests performed on
the rest of the herd on Sunday [7 Sep 2008] are expected on Tuesday
[9 Sep 2008].

"Tests have also been done on neighbouring herds which have had some
contact with the affected herd through common pastures," said Leif
Denneberg, head veterinarian from the Swedish Board of Agriculture,
to the TT news agency [Tidningarnas Telegrambyra, Stockholm].

More veterinarians will travel to the region on Monday [8 Sep 2008]
to perform tests on other farms in the immediate vicinity of the farm
with confirmed cases of the disease.

"In addition we'll start vaccinating, which will occur at the same
time," said Denneberg.

Besides vaccinations, the animals will be treated with an insecticide
to kill off the midges that spread the bluetongue virus.

The Agriculture Board has implemented restrictive measures in a large
area around the garden.

First, a 20-km (12.4 mi) radius restrictive area has been set up
around the affected farm within which animals cannot be moved.

In addition, a 150-km (93.2 mi) radius protective area has also
created within which existing animals are free to move, but beyond
which they cannot be taken.

"The county administrative board can provide permission for
transporting animals for slaughter and the Agriculture Board for the
moving of grazing animals," said Denneberg.

He emphasized the importance of quickly determining whether the
disease has spread any further, but that it's not going to look like
measures taken to stop mad cow disease, which involved the mass
slaughtering of animals.

Blue tongue disease affects cattle, sheep, and goats, but not humans.
There is no danger in consuming meat and milk from affected animals.

Bluetongue now also in Sweden
-----------------------------
Bluetongue disease has now emerged for the 1st time also in Sweden.
The disease has been detected in 2 animals on a dairy farm in the
southern province Halland.

The infection has been discovered by the testing of milk within the
Swedish surveillance programme, which has become operational in view
of the large number of outbreaks in other parts of West Europe.

The cows on the affected farm have not shown yet any clinical
symptoms of disease. According to the Swedish Board of Agriculture,
direct measures have been taken to obtain a clear picture of virus
spread, and vaccination will be carried out within a 20 km (12.4 mi)
area around the affected farm.

[A press release addressing the outbreak was published on 6 Sep 2008
by SVA (Sweden's National Veterinary Institute), and is titled, "The
1st Swedish case of the animal disease bluetongue" (Forsta svenska
fallet av djursjukdomen blatunga); see <http://www.sva.se/sv/> (in
Swedish).

The item included, among others, the following: "The 1st Swedish
[case of the] disease was [detected] in the Swedish surveillance
programme through a sample of milk from the farm. After thorough
testing, the National Veterinary Institute, SVA, confirmed bluetongue
in 2 heads of cattle in the herd. The infected animals had not shown
any symptoms of the disease. Sampling for the farm will continue and
additional farms in the restriction zone will be sampled.

"It is urgent that we quickly get an idea of whether the disease is
spread in the area. We are preparing in addition to a vaccination
against [bluetongue] starting in an area with a radius of 20 km (12.4
mi) from the infected herd," said Leif Denneberg, the chief of the
Swedish Board of Agriculture.

"Livestock owners who suspect bluetongue [of which a detailed
clinical description was included - Mod.AS] in their flocks should
immediately contact the veterinarian."

Phone numbers included:
Board of Agriculture: customer service 0771-223 223; Bengt Larsson,
infectious diseases 070-290 37 53; Leif Denneberg, chief veterinarian
070-645 27 68.
National Veterinary Institute: Gunilla Hallgren, veterinarian 070-63 12 234.

Final serotype confirmation of the laboratory findings, entomological
data, and additional information on the suspected animals, including
their history (age, birthplace, possible contacts with calving
imported animals) and the date of their sampling, will be useful. It
will be important to note if the finding is indicative of a locally
acquired infection or reflecting an exposure elsewhere.

The aerial distance between Halmstad and the closest bluetongue
outbreak in northern Europe, namely Bredebro in the southern part of
Jutland, Denmark, is 350-400 km (218-250 mi).

A map where both locations can be seen is available in Denmark's
notification to the OIE, available on-line at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=7303>.
A map of Denmark's restriction zones is available at

Food Chain and Animal Health (SCFCAH) on 2-3 September, in Brussels:
