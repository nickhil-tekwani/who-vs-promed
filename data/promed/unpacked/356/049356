State Secretary/Minister of Agriculture Sharon Dijksma wants to remain fully committed to obtaining international acceptance of emergency vaccination as a legitimate measure in the fight against infectious animal diseases.

This refers specifically to "emergency vaccination to live," meaning that there will be no requirement to cull the vaccinated animals. The issue has been included in a letter sent by the State Secretary this week to the parliament.

In the letter, Dijksma summarises the state of affairs in this file. The Netherlands is in Europe's forefront when it comes to the use of emergency vaccination with marker vaccines, addressing outbreaks of diseases such as classical swine fever [CSF] and foot-and-mouth disease [FMD]. In the aftermath of the epizootics of CSF in 1997 and FMD in 2001, it has become clear that society no longer accepts mass culling of apparently healthy animals as a control measure.

In recent years the Netherlands has managed to achieve the EU's acceptance of emergency vaccinations. However, the marketing of animal products from vaccinated animals remains to be settled. It is also not clear how foreign countries, in particular outside the EU circle, will react if the Netherlands is to apply emergency vaccination in the fight against disease.

According to Dijksma, there is a steadily increasing number of countries within Europe moving [toward] or positively considering emergency animal vaccination. Germany has included in its legislation a requirement that emergency vaccination be considered instead of culling, provided that an approved vaccine is available. The Minister also states that France considers emergency vaccination as a control measure in case of animal disease outbreaks. Dijksma wishes to hold consultations with the UK this year [2013], on the application of emergency vaccination. The US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand accept emergency vaccination "for life."

Within the international organization for animal diseases (OIE), the ministry intends to support relaxation of standards. According to Dijksma, there is no scientific evidence to justify delays in the recovery of the disease-free status of countries following their use of certified vaccines.

[The full text of Minister Dijksma's letter to the House, dated 4 Jun 2013 (in Dutch), is available at http://tinyurl.com/pwsuwol.

Until 1991, mass vaccinations against FMD were annually applied in several EU member countries (such as, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Italy) with satisfactory results. Under pressure of other countries (such as, the UK, Denmark, Ireland) this was discontinued, moving to "vaccination prohibition" policy, as expressed in the revised EU legislation. Imports of vaccinated animals and their products from "3rd countries" to the EU was banned. Some traumatic experiences since -- in particular, the 2001 FMD-O epizootic in the UK and some continental EU countries, accompanied by mass culling involving millions of apparently healthy animals on top of a standstill of animal movements, and the closing down, for an extended period, of public parks, etc., as well as the ecological and economical consequences -- contributed to significant changes in public opinion regarding the non-vaccination, stamping-out policy. The development of DIVA (differentiating infected from vaccinated animals) vaccines has paved the way to the approval of emergency vaccination.

Further developments, including the impact of the suggested changes upon international trade, are anticipated with interest. - Mod.AS
