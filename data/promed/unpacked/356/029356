The Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs confirmed 2 cases of eastern equine encephalitis [EEE] from the Regional Municipality of Niagara on 12 Sep 2018. Both horses were unvaccinated and had no travel history. One horse is recovering from depression and ataxia with supportive treatment. The other horse was euthanized following the development of sudden and severe neurological signs. The total number of EEE cases for 2018 is 10.

EEE is a mosquito-transmitted disease that is much more severe than West Nile virus (WNV). The mortality rate in horses from WNV is reported at around 30 percent, while the rate for EEE is almost 90 percent. Infected mosquitoes are the primary source for EEE.

The virus causes inflammation or swelling of the brain and spinal cord. General symptoms include central nervous system signs such as: head pressing, convulsions, lack of response to facial stimulation, fever above 103 F [39 C], ataxia, paralysis, anorexia, depression and stupor. Other symptoms may include irregular gait, teeth grinding, in-coordination, circling, and staggering. All symptoms may not be exhibited by an infected horse.

[It is unfortunate that this article does not mention vaccinating the horse or using equine-specific sprays for control of mosquitoes and flies on horses. It is also unfortunate there is no mention of cleaning up standing water, such as puddles, old tires holding water, even the catch pan of potted plants. Mosquito larvae are found in standing water puddles.

In addition to protecting yourself, please protect your equine friend by completing the vaccination regimen. Generally, an initial vaccination is followed 3-4 weeks later with a 2nd injection. Injections should be repeated at approximately every 4-6 months, as immunity to EEE wanes fairly quickly. EEE efficiently kills horses. The vaccine is not expensive, but a dead horse is.

Most EEE vaccines are combined with those for western equine encephalitis, West Nile virus, and tetanus, so you get a lot of bang for the buck when it comes to equine protection. If you have not vaccinated, please do so immediately.
