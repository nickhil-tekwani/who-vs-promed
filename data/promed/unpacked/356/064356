Two out of 12 people diagnosed with meningitis have died in the district of
Namuno, in the province of Cabo Delgado, revealed Mozambique's national
health director Alexandre Manguele, on 14 July.
He said that all 12 cases were diagnosed in the same village, Muarisse, and
that five of the cases were in one family.
Manguele said the authorities have taken the necessary treatment measures
and are working to prevent the disease from spreading to other areas.
As preventive measures, Manguele said that health authorities have launched
a vaccination campaign covering the population of the whole district and
surrounding areas.
"We have created a preventive cordon", he said, adding that vaccines are
being provided for the "target groups", namely boarding centres, military
barracks, prisons, creches and schools. Meningitis spreads very fast in
crowded environments, he explained.
