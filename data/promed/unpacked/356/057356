Duck deaths possibly caused by bacterial or fungal infection
------------------------------------------------------------
Officials still don't know why as many as 2500 mallard ducks have died in a
bizarre cluster along a south eastern Idaho creek bed, but preliminary test
results indicate a bacterial or fungal infection could be to blame, a state
game official said late Thursday [13 Mar 2008].

More tests are now planned on water and grain, said David Parrish,
supervisor for the Magic Valley region of the Idaho Department of Fish and
Game. "We have some preliminary results," he told The Associated Press in a
telephone interview. "It could be some type of bacterial infection or a
fungal-related infection. But we haven't confirmed that for sure."

Parrish and members of the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality, the
state Department of Agriculture, the federal Homeland Security Department
and US Fish and Wildlife Service conferred by conference call late
Thursday. He declined to say specifically what was discussed, but didn't
rule out that more ducks might die in the area. "We may have a few more,
but that's a little difficult to predict right now until we can determine
the exact cause of the mortality," he said. He said the die-off was not
typical. "It's fairly uncommon, especially in these types of numbers and in
such a confined area," he said. The tests were being performed at the Fish
and Wildlife Service's national laboratory in Wisconsin, the University of
Idaho, and Washington State University.

The ducks mysteriously began dying last week around Land Springs Creek,
near the remote town of Oakley, about 180 miles south east of Boise. On
Thursday, state workers cleared the last remaining duck carcasses from the
area in pickup trucks. They brought the bodies to a nearby incineration site.

Migratory mallards from Canada and their local cousins staggered and
struggled to breathe before collapsing, Parrish said. He said every mallard
in a radius of several miles has died -- about 2500, up from an earlier
estimate of 1000. "I've never seen anything like this in 20 years here," he
said. "There were dead mallards everywhere -- in the water and on the
banks. It was odd; they were in a very small area."

The massive outbreak is puzzling scientists because only mallard ducks are
dying. Golden eagles, geese, magpies, crows, and other birds in the area
all remain healthy. In the past, small outbreaks of botulism have killed
water birds in Idaho, but the disease quickly spreads among different
species. "Typically, you'd see this spread into other types of waterfowl as
well," Parrish said.

Mark Drew, a wildlife veterinarian with the state Department of
Agriculture, said earlier that investigators were not ruling out any cause
of death, but bird flu virus remained unlikely. The signs -- bacterial
lesions in the lungs and hemorrhaging in the heart wall -- probably point
to a bacterial infection, he said. Drew said the ducks likely were exposed
to a single contamination source and gathered at the creek, their mutual
roosting point, to die.

No dead ducks have been spotted anywhere besides the creek. Investigators
did not find any dead marine life in the shallow stream. The ducks might
have contracted a bacterial or fungal infection by eating grain treated
with pesticides by local cattle farmers, Drew said earlier. Farming
chemicals might also have spilled into the small spring-fed creek, which
measures just 3- to 6-inches deep.

Farmland surrounds the backwoods waterway. A cattle feedlot is close by.
Parrish said there are no factories in the area that discharge toxins into
local streams and rivers. Wastewater does not run into the creek, he said.

The investigating agencies posted signs warning hunters not to eat any
birds killed near the creek.

[Bacterial lesions in the lungs are certainly suggestive of bacterial or
fungal disease. This many birds in a short time makes me think of toxins,
however, and I hope the lab is examining the birds for toxicants that may
be associated with grains. - Mod.TG]
