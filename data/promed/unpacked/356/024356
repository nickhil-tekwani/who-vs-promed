[Phichit] suspects 4 new cases of bird flu
------------------------------------------
The public health authority of Pijit [Phichit] province, Doctor
Prajak Wattanakul along with the Contagious Disease Control Unit
reported from the Sam Ngam district hospital yesterday [29 Jul 2008]
that the team were called on to inspect 4 new patients who are
suspected of having avian flu.

The patients comprise 2 young children ages 6 and 10 and 2 elderly
women ages 62 and 70. Despite the patients being from different
Tambon [a local government administrative unit] in the district,
physicians found that all had come into contact with poultry before
falling ill and all exhibited symptoms of coughing, fatigue,
shortness of breath, and other bird flu related conditions. Doctors
have sent off samples of the patients to be analyzed, and are
expecting results in 1-2 days. All 4 have been quarantined, as the
chickens that they had contacted all experienced unexplained deaths
in the past days.

[Although this report emanates from a government agency, it seems
unlikely that these suspected human cases of avian influenza will be
confirmed. There have been no confirmed human cases of avian
influenza in Thailand since 27 Sep 2006, and none anywhere for
several months. There is also no confirmation that avian influenza
was responsible for the deaths of local poultry.

Pijit (Phichit) is no. 40 in the centre of the country. - Mod.CP

Thailand's last outbreak in poultry was reported to OIE in January
2008. In March, a "final" report was submitted, stating that the
outbreak was resolved. The January outbreak was reportedly in Village
No 7, SakLek, PHICHIT. - Mod.AS]
