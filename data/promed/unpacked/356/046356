[Our previous report on 27 Feb 2011 indicated there were clinical
signs in cattle and pigs, yet this 1st official report of the disease
indicates horses as the species involved. Vesicular Stomatitis Virus
(VSV) can affect all 3 species, while the clinically indistinguishable
but epidemiologically more problematic foot and mouth disease will not
affect horses. So we can be sure we are dealing with VSV and not FMD
in this outbreak.

VSV has been seen in the past in Belize in 2005 and 2007. It has also
been commonly seen in the region, with all the other countries in
Central America reporting the disease to the OIE WAHID database in
both 2009 and 2010. Nicaragua had a total of 416 outbreaks in 2009 and
2010. VSV outbreaks can be widespread wherever it occurs, as it is
spread by insects. The movement of animals may also be involved.
Certainly, we have a history of large numbers of farms being involved
in the United States, where 2004 outbreaks involved 294 premises.

A fact sheet can be obtained from USDA-APHIS at
<http://www.aphis.usda.gov/publications/animal_health/content/printable_version/fs_vesicular_stomatitis_07.pdf>.

The location of the outbreak in Cayo, which is away from the coast
and centrally located, can be seen on the map appended to the OIE
report or on HealthMap at <http://www.healthmap.org/promed/>. -
