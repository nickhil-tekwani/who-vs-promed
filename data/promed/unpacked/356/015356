From: "Jacques Morvan" <morvan@intnet.cf>

Ebola virus is stable, but many variants may exist. Recently we have
conducted an epidemiological study to determine the frquency and
distribution of filovirus seroprevalence (Ebola virus and Marburg virus
antibodies using ELISA) in populations living within the rain forest domain
of Central African Republic.
Pygmies appeared to have a high seroprevalence
against Ebola-Zaire virus antigens in the absence of clinical
manifestations. The results (not published) suggest that non-pathogenic
filovirus strains may circulate in central Africa among human population.
So we agree that "there are probably other antigenic variants of
Ebola out there in central Africa, with possibility differing lethalities".

[A small quibble: serological evidence of past infection does not
necessarily mean that a lot of pygmies survive Ebola-Zaire infection;
10-20% of Africans of other tribes also survive - Mod.JW
