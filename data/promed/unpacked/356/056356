Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) officials received confirmation of anthrax in a cow on a Hardeman County premises on 6 Aug 2021. This is the 2nd Texas county, following Val Verde County in July [2021], to have a confirmation this year [2021]. The premises is located in the northern portion of the county, northwest of Quanah, TX, and has been quarantined. TAHC rules require proper disposal of affected carcasses and vaccination of other cattle on the premises prior to release of the quarantine.

"TAHC personnel will continue to closely monitor the case in Hardeman County," said Dr Andy Schwartz, TAHC state veterinarian and executive director. "Because this isn't a common area for anthrax to occur, we encourage producers in the county to consult with their local veterinary practitioner if they suspect their animals are exposed to anthrax or are interested in vaccinating their livestock."

Anthrax is a bacterial disease caused by _Bacillus anthracis_, which is a naturally occurring organism with worldwide distribution, including certain parts of Texas. Cases in Texas are most often found in portions of Crockett, Val Verde, Sutton, Edwards, Kinney, and Maverick counties. This case in Hardeman County is unusual in that anthrax hasn't been reported in the county for several decades.

An effective vaccine for livestock is available and is commonly used in areas that are prone to have anthrax. To be effective, the vaccine must be used before the animal is exposed to the bacteria. There is no approved vaccine for deer. For further details on vaccinating your livestock for anthrax, please consult a local veterinarian or a local TAHC region office. All label directions should be followed carefully, including personal protective measures while handling the vaccine to prevent accidental exposure.

It is common to see an increase in anthrax cases after periods of wet, cool weather, followed by hot, dry conditions. During these conditions, animals can ingest the anthrax bacteria when they consume contaminated grass and hay, or inhale the spores. Outbreaks usually end when cooler weather arrives.

After exposure to anthrax, it typically takes 3-7 days for animals to show symptoms of anthrax. Once symptoms begin, death will usually occur within 48 hours. Acute fever followed by rapid death with bleeding from body openings are all common signs of anthrax in livestock. If you observe wild or domestic animals dying, more than 10 animals at a time, and carcasses show bleeding that is characteristic of anthrax, move livestock away from carcasses immediately.

[Hardeman county (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardeman_County,_Texas), on the northern border with western Oklahoma, has no recent reports of anthrax since the county is missing from the Texas historical anthrax records of 1974-2018 (https://www.dshs.texas.gov/idcu/disease/anthrax/information/data/). The TAHC hints at some outbreak(s) in the distant past. Whatever the reality, the probability of viable spores in the soil of a cattle grave sufficient to be an infection dose for a grazing cow is very small if not absent. An outbreak in a spore-free county bordering another state makes one suspect there is a trans-border source. However, it must be pointed out that Oklahoma has not seen a case of anthrax since 1996, and we have no reports in ProMED of anthrax outbreaks in this state. The last outbreaks in Oklahoma were in the eastern end of the county and, if my memory is correct, were a result of a contaminated mineral mix.

We can only hope that the TAHC will mount a thorough investigation of this outbreak, along with their Oklahoma colleagues. It could be that someone in Hardeman county had bought some deer from southern Texas and, if a deer had a latent infection, the stress of travel and the current hot weather might have made it overt. Tabanid flies feeding on this sick cervid could have taken the infection to a nearby cattle herd. A lot of "mights." The same latent infection hypothesis would also apply to cattle recently purchased from a state with bovine anthrax. We must wait to see what any investigation reveals. - Mod.MHJ
