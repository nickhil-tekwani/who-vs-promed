Researchers are scrambling to determine what's behind the death of 30 whales in the Gulf of Alaska as unusually warm ocean temperatures continue to wreak havoc on the region.

Since May 2015, 14 fin whales, 11 humpback whales, one gray whale, and 4 unidentified specimens have been found dead along shorelines in the Gulf of Alaska, nearly half of them in the Kodiak Archipelago. Other dead whales have been reported off the coast of British Columbia, including 4 humpbacks and one sperm whale.

This year's [2015] total is roughly 3 times the annual average for the region, leading the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to declare the deaths an "unusual mortality event." The investigation into the deaths will take months, or even years, according to a statement released by the agency.

Predation, starvation, or disease could be behind the deaths, but researchers say there have been few signs of physical trauma to the whales. The more likely culprit is unusual water conditions.

Over the past 2 years, a large mass of warm water that climatologists have dubbed "the blob" has persisted in the north Pacific, and El Nino 2015 is pushing more warm water into the region.

The unusually warm and calm seas are believed to be behind a series of toxin-producing algae blooms -- record-breaking in size and duration -- stretching from southern California to the Aleutian Islands. Clams sampled near the town of Sand Point, Alaska were found to have toxin levels more than 80 times what the FDA [Food and Drug Administration] says is safe for human consumption, said Bruce Wright, a scientist who studies toxic algal blooms for the Aleutian and Pribilof Islands Association. The levels were 10 times anything Wright had previously recorded.

"The conditions I look for are warm water temperatures and sunny, calm weather," Wright said. "All the conditions seem to be right for a significant event. And associated with this major event, you would expect to see die offs of marine mammals and seabirds and fish, and that's what we're seeing."

The unusually warm water has been affecting sea and weather conditions in the North Pacific in other ways. Tropical fish have been turning up in Alaska, including 4 ocean sunfish -- rare to the region -- that were spotted in Prince William Sound earlier this month [August 2015].

"I don't think the ocean temperature would affect the whales directly," said Bree Witteveen, a marine mammal specialist with the Alaska Sea Grant program in Kodiak. "It would be an indirect influence. It would alter where the prey is gathering -- things like that."

NOAA's declaration that the whale deaths constitute an "unusual mortality event" triggers the formation of an investigative team and opens the possibility to secure additional funding for research, according to NOAA spokesperson Julie Speegle.

"We are sending up a team to investigate this particular event, and we'll have more resources to hopefully get out and do more necropsies." Speegle said. "The more samples we can take from these dead whales, we can test for biotoxins or viral agents and wide range of possible causes."

Earlier this summer [2015], Alaska Native communities along the coast, including Kodiak's Sun'aq Tribe, had raised concerns about another possible danger to marine life -- US Navy training that allows the use of underwater sonar, which some research has linked to whale strandings.

"At this point, the tribe is just standing by to find out what NOAA comes up with," said Tom Lance, natural resources director at the Sun'aq Tribe. "We're not pointing fingers at the Navy. We're suspicious that their activities could impact marine mammals, of course, but until we have more facts we can't say definitively that it's one thing or another."

Only one whale has been sampled so far, and Wright said the carcass was too decomposed to provide any reliable insight.

"I really think we don't have enough information to even speculate," Witteveen said. "It's definitely a mystery for us. I wish there was a smoking gun or leading hypothesis for us to look into. It's just so unusual; it's really hard to say."

[This article discusses toxins, but is not specific. It may be only related to a warmer water issue, one that these animals are not capable of handling. These deaths may be a case of domoic acid or some other type of algae producing a toxin. It may be a scarcity of food because of warmer water. It would be helpful to know what a post mortem and associated testing revealed.

Sonar has been shown to cause particular problems in whales. Surely, those using sonar would be more aware of migration patterns of these mammals than to do it intentionally?

Domoic acid, an acidic cyanotoxin, a neurotoxic tricarboxylic amino acid structurally related to kainic and glutamic acids, associated with certain algal blooms and possibly produced by the diatom _Pseudonitzschia_ is also called amnesic shellfish poison (ASP). Domoic acid was named for the seaweed from which it was discovered, _Chondria armata_, called 'domoi' in Japan. The toxic acid is accumulated by marine organisms (including sea lions) feeding on phytoplankton, anchovies, sardines, and shellfish. Domoic acid is essentially a neurotoxin in mammals causing brain damage, neurological dysfunction, and death in severe cases.

In 1987, several people died and more than 100 became ill after eating blue mussels caught off Prince Edward Island, Canada. It was determined by Canadian scientists that domoic acid had entered the food chain when the mussels fed on a toxic algae bloom of the pinnate diatom _Pseudonitzschia pungens_ forma _multiseries_.

In 1991, in Monterey Bay, California, a bloom of _Pseudonitzschia australis_ also produced domoic acid that was then concentrated in anchovies feeding upon it. The deaths of pelicans and cormorants that ate the anchovies were reported to be related to their exposure to domoic acid.

Transient elevations of plasma BUN (blood urea nitrogen) levels, as well as neurodegeneration of the hippocampus, and memory deficits have been associated with near-lethal domoic acid exposures.

If there is more information on this situation, we would appreciate an updated report.

A review of domoic acid may also be found in ProMED-mail post Mammal, bird die-off, domoic acid - USA (CA) (02) 20020708.4702.
