Mumps outbreak ongoing since October 2007 in the Republic of Moldova
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The Republic of Moldova is experiencing a
nationwide mumps outbreak, with a total of 19 550
notified cases as of 23 Mar 2008. The outbreak
started in October 2007, with 105 cases notified
in that month compared to an average number of 24
cases per month notified between January and
September 2007. Between 1 Oct 2007 and 31 Dec 2007, 1 524 cases were notified.

In the Republic of Moldova, mumps monovalent
vaccination was introduced in 1983 as a
single-dose schedule targeting children aged
15-18 months-old. Since 2002, a 2nd dose has been
administered to 6- to 7-year-olds (birth cohorts
from 1995 onwards), using a combined vaccine for
measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR). Reported mumps
vaccination coverage has been high since its
introduction, except for a period in the early
1990s when a vaccine shortage occurred due to
political changes. Successful catch-up campaigns
subsequently improved vaccination coverage in
those birth cohorts affected by the vaccine
shortage. According to routine national
surveillance data, coverage with one dose of
mumps vaccine is 94 percent in individuals born
in 1989-1993. Coverage with 2 doses is 96 percent
in individuals born in 1995-2000. Coverage in the
1994 birth cohort is 99 percent and 21 percent
with one and 2 doses, respectively. The most
recent large mumps outbreak in the Republic of
Moldova occurred in 1996-1998, with 28 845 cases
reported, predominantly from birth cohorts 1983-1990 (60 percent).

In February 2008, the country's Ministry of
Health invited an international outbreak
investigation team coordinated by the World
Health Organization Regional Office for Europe,
to identify the extent of the mumps outbreak and
assess cases and their possible risk factors for
acquiring mumps, and to provide recommendations for the current outbreak.

The following is a preliminary description of the
extent and characteristics of the outbreak until 2 Mar 2008.

Methods
-------
In the Republic of Moldova, mumps cases are
notified by family doctors, hospitals and health
centres to 44 Regional Centres for Preventive
Medicine (RCPMs), with date of onset, initial
diagnosis, hospitalisation, and vaccination
history where available. The RCPMs aggregate and
transmit the data to the National Scientific and
Practical Centre for Preventive Medicine (NSPCPM)
on a monthly and annual basis. In addition to the
routine communicable diseases reporting, a weekly
transmission of mumps data to the NSPCPM was
introduced on 17 Dec 2007 to monitor the
outbreak. These reports are based on the
emergency notifications of suspected cases and
contain information on age, vaccination status,
hospitalisation, and number of cases in
educational institutions. Here we describe the
cases reported weekly between 17 Dec 2007 and 2 Mar 2008 (n=13 853).

Mumps is notified when suspected on clinical
grounds by a physician. For a minority of cases
(n=388, 3 percent), laboratory testing was
carried out. Mumps IgM antibody testing in
patients' sera (n=367) was performed at the
NSPCPM using a mumps IgM ELISA kit (Novalisa,
Novatec Immundiagnostica GmbH, Germany).
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of clinical
specimens (n=21) including throat swabs, oral
fluid, and urine, was performed at the National
Institute for Public Health and the Environment
(RIVM) in the Netherlands, and at the Health
Protection Agency (HPA), Centre for Infections, in the United Kingdom (UK).

Outbreak description
--------------------
Between 1 Oct 2007 and 2 Mar 2008, a total of 14
729 mumps cases were notified in the Republic of
Moldova. Case notifications increased rapidly in
the weeks following the holidays around New
Year's Day. The outbreak is ongoing at the time
of writing this report, with a peak of 2096 cases
in week 9 of 2008 (Figure 1). The monthly
incidence increased from below one case per 100
000 population in the months preceding the
outbreak to 25 case per 100 000 in December 2007
and more than 170 cases per 100 000 in February
2008 [Illustrated diagrammatically in the original text].

Case description
----------------
The majority of cases (n=11 128; 80 percent) were
15 to 24 years old (birth cohorts 1983-1992), and
60 percent (n=8298) were male [illustrated
diagrammatically in the original text. By the end
of February, all regions of the Republic of
Moldova were affected by the outbreak.

Vaccination data were available for 67 percent
(9223 of 13 853 cases) and 96 percent of them had
been vaccinated. Of these, 96 percent had
received one dose of mumps vaccine and 4 percent had received 2 doses.

In total, 5649 cases (41 percent) were
hospitalised for epidemiological (isolation) and
clinical indications, and where care was not
available (e.g., students living in dormitories).
Information about complications was not available
at the national level. No deaths have been reported.

Of 367 serum samples taken from clinical cases
(one to 28 days after onset of parotid swelling),
234 (64 percent) were positive for anti-mumps IgM
at the NSPCPM. 313 of the 367 sera were collected
8 to 28 days after disease onset, 68 percent of
which were positive. The highest proportion of
positive results was found in the sera collected
between 11 and 20 days after disease onset (72
percent). Of 21 case sera tested with PCR at RIVM
(3 cases) and HPA (18 cases), 20 were positive
for mumps virus. The identified genotype G5 has
recently been found in several other countries
including Croatia, Denmark, Germany, the UK,
Canada, and the United States (US) (personal
communication with Dr K. Brown/Dr L. Jin, HPA).

Public health measures
----------------------
For this outbreak, the NSPCPM recommended
hospitalisation for epidemiologic indications of
those cases for whom isolation was not guaranteed
at home, particularly for cases living in
dormitories and boarding schools. Recommended
isolation was 10 days from onset of parotid swelling.

In January 2008, the Ministry of Health and the
NSPCPM initiated the procurement of 600 000 doses
of MMR vaccine for a Supplemental Immunisation
Activity (SIA). As of 6 Mar 2008, a total of 42
500 doses had arrived in the Republic of Moldova
and were distributed to health facilities. The
SIA began in week 9 of 2008 targeting individuals
in all settings born between 1989 and 1994
(including pupils, students and postgraduate
students in all educational institutions;
teaching staff born between 1984 and 1988; army,
police, and border troops). Information on the
total number of MMR vaccine doses administered to
date during the SIA is not available.

Discussion
----------
The Republic of Moldova is facing a large ongoing
mumps outbreak in teenagers and young adults, the
majority of whom have previously been vaccinated
with one dose of monovalent mumps vaccine. Mumps
outbreaks comparable to this one with respect to
size and affected age group have occurred
recently in several countries, including the UK,
the US, and Canada. In the outbreak in the UK
[1,2,3], 79 percent of cases in 2004 occurred in
individuals born between 1980-1989. Almost 2-3rds
of the cases were unvaccinated, however, 30
percent had received a single dose of MMR. In the
outbreaks in the US and Canada [4], 49 percent of
the cases had been vaccinated twice. Mumps
vaccine failure has often been attributed to
primary vaccine failure; i.e., an insufficient
immune response after vaccination [5]. More
recent studies have suggested that secondary
vaccine failure, i.e., decreasing antibody titres
over time (waning immunity), contributes to the
recurrence of mumps outbreaks [6,7]. In the
current outbreak, the high reported vaccine
coverage with a single dose of mumps vaccine
among the cases suggests that "failure to
vaccinate" did not play a major role as the cause
of the outbreak. Primary and secondary vaccine
failure [5,8] for one dose of mumps vaccine are
currently being investigated in a further epidemiological study.

A high proportion of cases in this outbreak were
hospitalised, mainly to ensure isolation but also
for clinical and social indications. However, as
mumps is most infectious from 2 days before to 4
days after onset of illness, and inapparent
infections can be communicable, hospital
admission is not expected to prevent the majority
of transmission in the population [9].

Outbreak control is ongoing with vaccination of
high risk groups with MMR vaccine, consistent
with a recent WHO position paper on mumps [10].
To address potential concerns of adverse events
following immunisation (AEFI), AEFI surveillance
including laboratory investigation of suspected
meningitis cases and training of primary health
care staff and epidemiologists will accompany this immunisation campaign.

[Mumps virus belongs to the genus _Rubulavirus_
of the family_Paramyxoviridae_. Although there is
only one distinct serotype of mumps virus,
sequence analysis of the variable gene encoding
the small hydrophobic protein (the SH gene) has
shown that a number of distinct genotypes circulate globally.

Mumps remains a childhood disease that has been
diffficult to contain by vaccination. Although
natural infection is believed to provide
life-long immunity, the mumps component of the
MMR triple vaccine is the least effective in
providing solid immunity. Insufficient childhood
vaccination coverage against mumps can result in
an epidemiological shift of disease incidence to
older age groups, potentially leading to higher
rates of serious disease and complications than
occurred before large scale immunization was introduced.

The WHO position paper accessible at
<http://www.who.int/entity/wer/2007/wer8207.pdf>
provides a comprehensive account of the
properties and performance of the several
different vaccines developed to provide immubity to mumps virus infection.
