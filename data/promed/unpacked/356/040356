----------------------------------------------------------------------
An ongoing chronology of cross-border rabies cases reported during
1970 to July 2011 includes 59 cases of human infection, from 20
countries; and 29 importations of rabid animals (27 dogs, 1 horse, and
1 cat) from 14 countries (GIDEON http://www.gideononline.com).

The most common countries for human exposure were India and the
Philippines (8 cases each), followed by Mexico (6) and Morocco (4). 7
rabid animals originated in Morocco. The most recent case detailed in
ProMED-mail is the 3rd to originate in Haiti (the 2 previous patients
also died in the United States), and the 13th case of imported rabies
in the US since 1983 [1, 2].
