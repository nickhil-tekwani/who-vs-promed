Subject: Emergency Management Warning 38: Exotic Newcastle Disease
Confirmed in the United States
All information in the following Notice marked with an asterisk (*)
identifies changes since the last Notice was sent out.
* Exotic Newcastle disease (END) was confirmed on 1 Oct 2002, in the
State of California, and has now spread beyond backyard flocks to
affect eight commercial operations in California.
On 16 Jan 2003, END was also confirmed in a backyard flock in the
State of Nevada.
In addition, a backyard flock was confirmed with END on 4 Feb 2003,
in the State of Arizona.
Clinical signs in infected birds include respiratory, nervous, and
gastrointestinal signs. Mortality is up to 90 percent of exposed
birds.
Investigations are on-going and all figures are pending final
validation. Veterinary Services is working rapidly to expand staff
on the Task Force in the States of Arizona, California, and Nevada
and is exploring all options to send Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service (APHIS) personnel, other federal government
personnel, and is working with the States to consider additional
resources to meet the labor demands. APHIS is continuing to develop
a plan for national END surveillance. This plan will enhance the
already extensive surveillance underway.
* Arizona Situation (as of 5:00 p.m. PST, 9 Feb 2003)
END has been confirmed in a backyard flock in La Paz County, AZ.
APHIS is currently developing a federal quarantine for the affected
area in Arizona. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has also
declared an extraordinary emergency. APHIS and the State of Arizona
have begun surveillance efforts of the backyard bird population and
have established a Task Force in Arizona.

* California Situation (as of 5:00 p.m. PST, 7 Feb 2003)
Officials with the California Department of Food and Agriculture
(CDFA) and APHIS continue to work closely on efforts to control the
END outbreak in Southern California. USDA has instituted a federal
quarantine zone that serves as a buffer around the END-affected area
in Southern California. The department has also declared an
extraordinary emergency to provide additional resources and
authorities to the eradication campaign for END in Southern
California.
* Number of premises positive: 532 (up 17 from 2/7 report)

Operational Update
Effective 7 Jan 2003, APHIS imposed a federal quarantine that
regulates the interstate movement of all species of birds and poultry
products from Imperial, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San
Bernardino, San Diego, Santa Barbara, and Ventura Counties, CA.
Effective 17 Jan 2003, APHIS imposed a federal quarantine that
regulates the interstate movement of all species of birds and poultry
products from Clark and a portion of Nye County, NV.
* The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has declared an
extraordinary emergency for the States of Arizona, California, and
Nevada. These declarations allow USDA to apply federal authority
within California and Nevada.
* Of the 1830 premises designated for depopulation, 85.6 percent have
been completed.
* A new commercial premises in San Bernardino County, CA, has been
identified as positive for END. This new finding brings the total
number positive commercial premises in California to 7 along with 1
contact commercial premises.
* The dramatic increase in the number of contact premises for
California is due to the designation of a new neighborhood flock in
Little Rock, CA.
Once affected premises are identified and birds humanely depopulated,
affected areas are being thoroughly cleaned and disinfected.
Landfills, composting, and rendering are being used for safe disposal
of affected birds and materials.
Task Force personnel are conducting a door-to-door campaign to
identify affected premises. Epidemiological investigations are
ongoing. Entities that sell birds continue to be monitored in
affected areas. If a flock tests positive, officials will quarantine
the premises immediately and order the destruction of the flock as
soon as it is logistically possible.
APHIS is developing a plan to enhance national END surveillance.
This plan will enhance the already extensive surveillance underway in
California and Nevada. Currently, an ICP is being established in
Arizona.
Outreach Activities
* Task Force information personnel are sending information materials
to the Central Valley Incident Command Post (ICP) for use in
surveillance. In addition, a public information officer has been
identified for assignment to the Central Valley ICP.
Task Force information personnel coordinated a joint press release
with an Indian Tribe to announce the newly designated infected
backyard premises in Arizona. Since the announcement earlier this
week, the information staff has received over 20 media calls related
to the newly designated infected premises in the State.
Public information staff provided liaison work for the Task Force
with the Garden Grove Police Department in anticipation of Area
Command's and the South Coast ICP's move later this month to a new
facility.
Presently, the public information staff has 9 public meetings
scheduled between now and 10 Mar 2003. This is exclusive of meetings
scheduled with bird clubs and other industry associations.
On a daily basis, Task Force public information personnel are
communicating information concerning surveillance, depopulation, and
cleaning and disinfection operations to all affected city managers in
Southern California.
Currently, Task Force information personnel field approximately 450
calls per week from the public. This is a 20-fold increase from the
number of calls from early October 2002. On average, approximately
300 of these calls require follow-up action by the ICP's. The Task
Force's public information staff, in cooperation with LPA in
Riverdale, is preparing 2 new documents for distribution: the revised
END brochure (which has been updated to include new information and
photographs) and the END pest alert fact sheet. Delivery is
anticipated within the next 3 weeks.
The Task Force information staff provides daily updates to
approximately 35 media outlets in California. In Area Command alone,
Task Force public information personnel handle an average of 70 media
calls per week.
