Response from the Texas Department of Health
--------------------------------------------
The Texas Department of Health has sent this response to an inquiry about
the possible exposure in Houston or Dallas of a person who had an onset of
measles on Fri 13 Apr 2001 in Mexico.
This year, Texas has had only one case of measles in an adoptee exposed in
China with an onset on 14 Feb 2001. We did not have any cases of measles in
2000, and in 1999 we had 7 cases of which 6 were directly related to
international travel.
The incubation period for measles from exposure to rash onset averages 14
days (range 7-18 days). The incubation period from exposure to prodromal
illness is 10-12 days with the prodrome usually lasting 2-4 days. Since
your index case had rash starting on 13 Apr 2001, it is most likely that he
was exposed between 27 Mar 2001 and 6 Apr 2001 after he left the US.
In the US, measles cases are most likely to occur from exposure to
international travelers. I have checked with the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention regarding reported cases that may have traveled
through Dallas or Houston on 25 Mar 2001. There were no reported cases
meeting these criteria. However, I did learn that there has been an
outbreak in Korea with over 40 000 cases, and in the US there were
outbreaks in Washington and Illinois in January with epidemiological links
to Korea and virus from a Korean/Chinese strain (H1). Since your index case
had contact with Korean travelers, there is some possibility that this was
the source of exposure.
However the time of exposure is slightly outside of the probable exposure
period. Is it possible that you collected any specimens for viral isolation?

[ProMED-mail welcomes this rapid and comprehensive response from the Texas
Department of Health to the official statement from Mexico in the preceding
post. Genotyping of a virus isolate from the focus of infection in Mexico
would help to confirm contact with Korean tourists/visitors as the source
of the disease importation. Information on the outcome of any such analysis
would be appreciated. - Mod.CP
