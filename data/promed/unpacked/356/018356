This occurred after a period of intense rainfall. The unspoken speculation
here is groundwater contamination or runoff from a livestock farm. I cannot
imagine any other way of getting such a high concentration of organisms.
This is politically a very sensitive issue and any other reason is better
than the truth. The lake is immediately surrounded by semi-rural upscale
home sites, a few yacht clubs, a branch of the University of Illinois, and
a few camps. It is hardly wilderness area, so I found the rodent idea very
entertaining. It has a long history of agricultural contamination with
costs of $2,000,000 per year (I think that was the last number I heard) to
remove the atrazine from the water to make it suitable for drinking.
We had a large, unexplained die-off of sea gulls this spring also. Nice
lake, smelly issue.

[Atrazine is a herbicide used for weed control on corn fields. While not
wishing to fuel an "X-Files" paranoia, maybe one of those involved in
investigating this outbreak would be willing to comment on the above
speculation. - Mod.MHJ
