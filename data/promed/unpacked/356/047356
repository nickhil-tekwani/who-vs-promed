The Oklahoma State Department of Health and the Tulsa Health Department announced the 1st round of results on 18 Apr 2013 from testing completed on 3122 people who had been patients of W. Scott Harrington's dental surgical practice.

Completed laboratory tests on 3122 people who were treated at W. Scott Harrington's dental surgical practice have identified 57 individuals who tested positive for hepatitis C and 3 individuals who tested positive for hepatitis B, the Oklahoma State Department of Health and the Tulsa Health Department announced on 18 Apr 2013. "Positive results have been reported for HIV, but OSDH Data Security Policy regarding HIV disclosure prohibits public reporting of numbers less than 3," the 2 agencies stated in a statement posted that day.

This confirmation came after the 1st round of results from the testing. On 28 Mar 2013, public health officials announced they were notifying current and former patients of the practice that they may have been exposed to bloodborne viruses at Harrington's Tulsa and Owasso offices and urged them to be tested.

The Oklahoma State Department of Health's Public Health Laboratory completed the testing for 3122 people; 3235 people as of 18 Apr 2013 had visited county health departments to have blood drawn for testing, and an unknown number of others have sought testing through private health care providers, the statement says. It says that based on current Oklahoma disease prevalence data for hepatitis B and C and HIV, health officials know some of the positives probably resulted from infection exposure not related to the Harrington practice. The most recent data available indicates an estimated 4944 people are living with HIV/AIDS in Oklahoma and as many as 68 000 Oklahomans may be infected with hepatitis C.

"We understand these 1st reported test results may be of concern," said THD Director Dr. Bruce Dart. "Thorough investigations are routinely conducted upon notification of a positive report for these infections. This response will be handled in the same manner, as disease investigation is a core public health service, and staff are well trained to conduct this type of response."

The departments are notifying people who participated in the screening of their test results; those with positive tests are being personally contacted and counseled and will be directed to resources for appropriate care and follow-up. If warranted, testing will be recommended for a spouse or partner.

"This is a complex investigation," State Epidemiologist Dr. Kristy Bradley said. "The next phase will include more in-depth interviews of persons who test positive to determine the likelihood that their exposure is associated with their dental surgical procedure at the Harrington practice. We will certainly continue to keep the public informed as we learn more."

[Previously, it was reported that some 7000 patients who since 2007 received treatment at a dental practice in Tulsa, Oklahoma will begin to receive letters recommending that they be tested for the presence of the blood-borne pathogens hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV are serious infections, and patients may not have outward symptoms of these diseases for many years.

The dental practice in Tulsa was being investigated for serious breaches of normal surgical and dental procedures over a considerable period of time. The investigation of the dental clinic was initiated because one of the dentist's patients recently tested positive for hepatitis C and HIV without known risk factors other than receiving dental treatment.

It seems likely that the 57 people among the 3122 tested so far contracted hepatitis C virus infection during attendance at this dental practice.
