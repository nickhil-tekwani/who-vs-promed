NHS [National Health Service] Greater Glasgow and Clyde, NHS Ayrshire & Arran, Police Scotland and Health Protection Scotland are investigating 3 new probable cases of botulism in drug injecting heroin users. 2 of the new patients are from the Greater Glasgow and Clyde area while 1 is from the NHS Ayrshire & Arran area. All 3 are receiving treatment in hospital and are in a serious condition. This takes the total number of probable cases to 5. The initial 2 patients, 1 critical and 1 stable, are still in hospital. The cause of these infections continues being investigated with the focus on injecting drug use.

Dr Catriona Milocevi, NHS Greater Glasgow Consultant in Public Heath Medicine, said: "I urge all drug injecting heroin users to be extremely alert and to seek urgent medical attention from Accident and Emergency if they experience any early symptoms such as blurred or double vision, difficulty in swallowing and speaking and/or inflammation at the injection site. It is important for injecting drug users to engage with the wide range of services we offer designed to help them tackle their addictions. However for those who continue to inject it is extremely important that they seek urgent medical help if they show these early symptoms.

"Heroin users should avoid injecting heroin into their muscles. Injecting heroin into a vein or smoking can reduce the risk of botulism, although not using heroin at all is by far the best course of action."

[Wound botulism occurs when spores of _Clostridium botulinum_ contaminate a wound, germinate, and produce botulinum neurotoxin in vivo. Most of the wound botulism cases have been among injecting drug users (IDUs). Those IDUs who intentionally or accidentally inject subcutaneously or intramuscularly may be particularly vulnerable to infection.

Black tar heroin continues to be associated with clusters of wound botulism, both in the USA and in Europe. This form of heroin is a gummy black substance usually produced in makeshift factories, mostly in Mexico, adjacent to opium poppy fields (1). It is generally injected subcutaneously in a process referred to as skin popping. The local area may be unremarkable or may be necrotic or abscess forming.

The tarry nature of the drug has led to a number of diluents ("cutting" agents), which have been postulated to be the source of the _C. botulinum_ spores. In Passaro's study (1), the development of wound botulism was not affected by cleaning the skin, cleaning the injection paraphernalia, or sharing needles.

Clinicians should suspect botulism in any patient with a descending, flaccid paralysis. Botulinum antitoxin is effective in reducing the severity of symptoms for all forms of botulism if administered early in the course of the disease and should not be delayed for the results of microbiological testing.

In cases of wound botulism, antimicrobial therapy and surgical debridement are necessary to remove the organism and avoid relapse after antitoxin treatment. _C. botulinum_ is sensitive to benzyl penicillin and metronidazole.

Toxin type A (one of now 8 types of botulinum toxin) causes most cases of wound botulism in the USA. The syndrome produced by toxin type A is most severe, with more rapid progression of paralysis and a higher proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation. All toxin types exert their action on the cholinergic system at the presynaptic motor-neuron terminal by blocking acetylcholine transmission across the neuromuscular junction.
