Thailand: 2 suspected Cases of Avian Influenza A (H5N1) Virus Infection
---------------------------------------------------
Thailand is testing 2 children for possible infection with bird flu, the
deadly disease which has erupted again after devastating Asian poultry
flocks earlier this year, officials said on Fri 23 Jul 2004.
One, a 14-year-old boy, was a "probable" case of bird flu [avian influenza
A (H5N1) virus infection], Health Ministry spokeswoman Nittaya
Chanruangmahaphol told reporters. She did not say whether the boy had been
in close touch with infected chickens, as were 16 Vietnamese [WHO
recognizes 15 cases only] and 8 Thais who died of the disease earlier this
year when the H5N1 virus swept through much of Asia.
The other suspected case was a 12-year-old girl who had been in close touch
with chickens, Dr Charal Trinvuthiphong, head of Disease Control at the
Health Ministry, told reporters. "The girl was reported to have played with
and touched chickens," Charal said. "We are waiting for the lab test
which was sent to Bangkok."
Both suspected cases were in the northeastern province of Nong Khai near
the Lao border, one of 15 of Thailand's 76 provinces where recurrences of
bird flu have been confirmed, the officials said.
Thailand, the world's 4th-biggest chicken exporter in 2003, has culled 160
000 fowl since the H5N1 outbreak erupted anew early this month. China also
reported a new case recently, as did Indonesia. Both governments say their
new outbreaks are under control.
The Thai government put the country on high alert, ordering officials to
rush anyone to hospital who showed symptoms resembling those of bird flu.
There have been 10 such instances this month, and each patient has gone
home after being cleared of having bird flu. Friday was the first time that
senior officials had reported suspected cases in public.
