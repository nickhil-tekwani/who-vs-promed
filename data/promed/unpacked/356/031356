Unexpected Increase in Deaths from Alzheimer's, Dementia, and Other Neurological Disorders in England and Wales during 2012 and 2013
-------------------------------
ABSTRACT
Background:
---------
There was a large and unexpected increase in deaths due to Alzheimer's, dementia and certain other neurological diseases in 2012 and 2013 in England and Wales. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has suggested that the elevation of dementia to the leading cause of death in women during 2013 was simply due to changes in coding. This claim is investigated against a background of a suspected outbreak of a new type of immune modulating disease.

Methods:
--------
Cause of death statistics for England and Wales were analyzed in 2011, 2012 and 2013 using 5-year age bands. Change in deaths was adjusted for expected population growth.

Results:
--------
All-cause mortality in England and Wales increased relative to the expected downward trajectory in both 2012 and 2013. However, deaths due to Alzheimer's and dementia were particularly affected in an age-specific manner, which discounts explanations based on better coding of the cause of death. Certain other neurological conditions were also affected, especially in those aged over 70 years. Deaths in the oldest old (age 95 and older) generally declined. The effects upon late-onset Alzheimer's was far more pronounced in 2013 than 2012, especially in females.

Conclusion:
-------------
An infectious event appears to have occurred which led to a general increase in deaths, however, the percentage of increase was far greater for those suffering from neurological disorders and over the age of 70, but generally not in the oldest old. The nature and mode of action of a presumed infectious agent requires urgent research.

Discussion
----------
With over 1400 known human pathogens (of which over 220 are viruses), the possibility of new disease types is an area of increasing interest. Recent research has explored the evidence for a new type of immune-based disease and how its effects upon death and increased medical admissions for particular conditions have been repeatedly misdiagnosed. Outbreaks of this disease have gone unnoticed for 2 key reasons, Firstly, relatively slow spread within a country dilutes the effect observed at whole-country level, and secondly, the effect upon deaths or hospital admissions occurs across a 12 to 18 month period. Hence, the outbreak evades all current disease surveillance methodologies, which tend to look for influenza-type large and sudden spikes in deaths or admissions. Preliminary evidence suggests that an outbreak of this disease prior to a seasonal influenza epidemic acts to potentiate the effect of influenza, and in this scenario, the larger influenza peak is wrongly attributed to influenza alone. Re-analysis of monthly deaths during the last 3 outbreaks of this disease across Europe, which occurred in the interval 2002 to 2013, reveals an estimated 476 000 deaths during each outbreak. Due to the relatively slow spread within each country, this is assumed to be an under-estimate.

An effect of these outbreaks upon Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and dementia during 2012 has already been demonstrated; however, this study makes use of the fact that the increased deaths remained high in both 2012 and 2013, due to slower spread of the agent throughout the entire UK during both of these years. Preliminary evidence suggests that a further outbreak may also have occurred in 2014, but it will take several years for all of the relevant data to become available to fully investigate this possibility. A similar series of short-spaced multiple outbreaks occurred in 1993, 1996, 1999, and 2002. The key point is that a large infectious event has occurred with a persistent agent.

In the reduction in deaths forecast by the ONS, for most age bands below age 75 (except for females age 5-15), the number of deaths did indeed decline in 2012 and 2013 relative to 2011. However, specific increases occurred in the older age groups. In 2013, over 50 percent of deaths in England and Wales occurred above age 75, with the numerical peaks between ages 76 to 89 (male) and 83 to 93 (female), accounting for 45 percent of deaths. Any agent specifically targeting these older age groups will have the potential to create the large changes in all-cause mortality seen to occur in 2012 and 2013. However, all other figures show far higher age-dependent percentage increases in deaths and are, therefore, indicative of condition-specificity with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's in particular.

Roles for cytomegalovirus
------------------------
The issue that requires resolution is the exact involvement of the infectious agent. In this respect, it has been suggested that the ubiquitous herpes virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), may be implicated in these outbreaks, either via the introduction of a new strain or reactivation in the presence of another agent. The evidence for CMV rests mainly on its ability to substantially increase all-cause mortality and that the spectrum of conditions associated with both the increase in deaths and medical admissions mirror the known clinical conditions where CMV is most active. Future research will undoubtedly clarify these issues. Infections involving the nervous system are one of the more common manifestations of CMV. If CMV is the agent, the question remains as to whether the increase in death is potentiated by a primary infection (perhaps by exposure to a new CMV strain), or was CMV merely taking opportunistic advantage of infection with another agent?

It has been noted that those suffering from neurological diseases will already have weakened immune function due to general immobility and lack of exposure to sunlight (and hence low levels of vitamin D, which will render them more susceptible to infection in general. The smaller peak in 2010, which involved the tail end of the swine-flu influenza epidemic, indicates that other infectious agents will also be circulating at the time of these outbreaks and may also take opportunistic advantage of whatever immune impairments are afforded by the outbreaks.

Gender specific effects
---------------------
Differences between the 2 genders are difficult to interpret, given the very high single-year-of-age specificity of these outbreaks. This age specificity can obscure the exact effects when using standard 5-year age bands, although on this occasion, the national data is only presented in this manner, with far higher gender specificity during the 2007/2008 outbreak. Further detailed research is required regarding these effects, especially in other countries. One suggestion has been to align the start date for each outbreak across Local Authority areas in order to amplify the effect of the outbreak, and thereby tease out the hidden gender, single-year-of-age, and time-lag issues specific to each condition.

A fascinating development has been the observation that natural killer (NK) cells are activated in the asymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's, which suggests an active immune response against a presently undefined "aggression" [34]. In this respect, the suggested involvement of CMV is somewhat appropriate.

While mortality in infants appears to be unaffected by these outbreaks, it is already known that there is a significant increase in non-fatal admission of infants to hospital due to infectious conditions during these outbreaks, i.e. immune-mediated resistance to certain infectious agents appears to be targeted during the outbreaks [31]. A specific CD4 T cell impairment toward CMV exists in young children [31].

A potential explanation based on CMV is also possible for the oldest old who are known to have a higher incidence of strict immune control of CMV infection [36]. Premature death in those members of the population who are CMV seropositive appears to enrich the oldest old with individuals who may be resistant to CMV infection or CMV-reactivation. In the elderly (aged 60-80), those who are CMV seropositive have double the level of C-reactive protein (CRP) to their non-CMV infected counterparts, indicating a high background inflammatory state [37]. Factors such as these are likely to explain the general decline in deaths in 2012 and 2013 observed in the 95 and older age group in Figure 3-5. [See Source]

CMV-mediated inflammation is also known to be associated with both cognitive and functional decline in the elderly [38]. CMV, therefore, remains a pathogen of interest in these outbreaks, although complex interaction with different CMV strains, other pathogens and human genetic variants are likely [21-22,27].

Conclusion
------
While changes in the coding of the cause of death introduced in 2011 resulted in a step-increase in deaths for Alzheimer's and dementia, it cannot explain the unexpected surge in deaths in 2012 and 2013. This surge in deaths was accompanied by the spatial spread of a presumed unidentified infectious agent. The elevation of dementia to the leading cause of deaths in females in 2013 was the outworking of this infectious-like event, and the explanation offered by the ONS lacks credible evidence.

There is now a significant body of evidence to suggest that a new type of disease outbreak is occurring which leads to very large increases in deaths among those already suffering from certain neurological disorders. The exact agent responsible needs to be urgently identified. Given the higher susceptibility of those suffering from neurological disorders, especially in the age range 75 to 94, it is suggested that these represent a defined group where research efforts can be focused.

Indeed, the possibility needs to be explored that outbreaks of this agent may also lead to the initiation of neurological disorders in susceptible individuals.

[On the basis of a comprehensive statistical analysis described here in outline, the authors have analysed recent mortality figures in England and Wales and suggest that there has been an increase in neurological disease in general in England and Wales. Specific examples are not analysed in detail other than for cytomegalovirus infection. All-cause mortality in England and Wales increased relative to the expected downward trajectory in both 2012 and 2013. However, deaths due to Alzheimer's and dementia were particularly affected in an age-specific manner, which discounts explanations based on better coding of the cause of death. Certain other neurological conditions were also affected, especially in those aged over 70 years. Deaths in the oldest old (age 95 and older) generally declined. The effects upon late-onset Alzheimer's were far more pronounced in 2013 than 2012, especially in females.

Further analysis of specific disease conditions affecting the elderly in particular are warranted on the basis of these data. More importantly, it will be relevant to determine whether similar data from another European country produce the same interpretation. - Mod.CP
