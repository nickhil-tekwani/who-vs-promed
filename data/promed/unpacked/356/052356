Ramyashree (name changed), age 4, of Vijayanagar [Karnataka state] has been in bed for 2 days with blisters on her feet, arms and mouth and mild fever. She has been spending her days away from friends, school and neighbours as prescribed by her dermatologist. Ramyashree has been diagnosed with hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD), a contagious viral infection.

"Quite a few children are getting this infection. The pediatrician asked me to keep my child in a separate room and maintain hygiene," said the girl's mother. Though several children like Ramyashree are affected by HFMD in the city [Bengaluru (Bangalore)], causing concern among parents -- especially following the spread of messages about it on WhatsApp -- doctors say there's nothing to worry as it is common among kids and an annual phenomenon.

"Hand, foot and mouth disease is common among young children and is characterized by sores in the mouth and rashes on the hands, feet and buttocks. It is most commonly caused by Coxsackie virus A16. The illness spreads by contact with an infected person. It is mainly breaking out in schools as children come in contact with others in school. In the past few days, I have been seeing around 6 to 7 new cases every day," said Dr Ramu DS, pediatric consultant of BGS Hospital.

He added, "There is no specific treatment. However, antipyretics can be used for fever and pain. Children should take plenty of fluids. In general, the disease clears up by itself within 7 to 10 days. It is contagious and patients should limit their exposure to others."

Allaying fears of its spread, Dr HN Usha, senior pediatrician at St Martha's Hospital, said, "No. The hand, foot and mouth disease is not spreading like an epidemic. Last year, the number of cases was much more. It is a viral disease so we treat it symptomatically. We give local painkillers as it interferes with feeding in children."

Echoing her view, district health officer Rajani M said, "There is no need to panic. It is essentially a zoonotic disease. Every year, some sporadic cases are seen. The spread of infection depends on maintenance of personal hygiene. There is no vaccine for this infection. But it is not an outbreak. Schools need not be closed. Only the child affected should be kept at home for a week's rest."

[India has experienced annual outbreaks of HFMD affecting young children, rather than the more extensive outbreaks of illness affecting infants. It is unclear whether this is due to social factors or the prevalent virus. Further information would be appreciated. - Mod.CP
