Of 19 collected specimens [oropharyngeal and nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs] from patients with pneumonia, 12 tested positive for _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_ during an outbreak at Georgia Institute of Technology in 2012. The outbreak, which occurred from 1 Sep 2012 to 4 Dec 2012, was the largest outbreak reported at a US university in 35 years, according to data in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report [Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) 62(30);603-606. Available at: http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6230a2.htm?s_cid=mm6230a2_w]. All of the 83 patients were students. [No cases were reported among faculty or staff members, according to the MMWR article.] Of the 19 patients who had specimens tested with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction [qPCR], 12 were positive for _M. pneumoniae_.

"_M. pneumoniae_ has been implicated in other pneumonia outbreaks at universities and is recognized as a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia among university students," researchers from the CDC and the Georgia Department of Public Health wrote. "Because _M. pneumoniae_ infection most commonly causes upper respiratory illness, infected persons often go about their normal activities and infect others, as in this outbreak."

In October 2012, health officials began to review university health services records to identify pneumonia cases from as early as 1 Sep [2012]. Initially, patient specimens were tested for 20 respiratory pathogens, but subsequent specimens were also tested for _M. pneumoniae_, _Chlamydophila pneumoniae_ and _Legionella_ species.

In November [2012], the Georgia Department of Public Health provided recommendations to halt the outbreak, and the university began a campaign that included email, social media postings and posters. The researchers also surveyed 105 students without pneumonia about the effectiveness of the campaign; 89 percent of the students said the preferred way to receive health communications was by email.

"To be effective during an _M. pneumoniae_ outbreak at a university, health messages need to reach students and educate them regarding their risk for infection and behaviors that can prevent infection," the researchers wrote. "Effective communications, coupled with university policies that facilitate students staying home and seeking medical care when ill, might reduce transmission of _M. pneumoniae_ and the severe complications that can go with it."

[The following is extracted from the CDC publication Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) 62(30);603-606 (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6230a2.htm?s_cid=mm6230a2_w):

"Probable cases were defined as a physician diagnosis of pneumonia in a Georgia Institute of Technology student during 1 Sep to 4 Dec 2012, with or without qPCR evidence. Confirmed cases met the criteria for a probable case and had _M. pneumoniae_ detected in oropharyngeal, nasal, or nasopharyngeal swabs by qPCR. During 1 Sep to 4 Dec 2012, a total of 83 cases were identified, including 12 confirmed and 71 probable cases. Illness onset occurred during 4 Aug to 2 Dec 2012 and peaked at the beginning of November (Figure). Patients were predominantly men (72 percent), and the age range was 18-30 years (median: 21 years), both representative of the overall student population. A total of 10 (12 percent) patients had underlying asthma; this rate of asthma is statistically similar to the expected rate among adults aged 18-24 years in Georgia, according to results from the 2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey. A total of 79 patients (95 percent) reported cough, 64 (77 percent) fever, 36 (43 percent) headache, and 34 (41 percent) sore throat. A total of 5 (6 percent) patients with no underlying medical conditions were hospitalized with complications, including 4 with respiratory failure and one with perimyocarditis; all recovered. A total of 43 (52 percent) patients were treated with doxycycline, 23 (28 percent) with azithromycin, and 7 (8 percent) with other or multiple antibiotics (Table 1).

"A total of 19 (23 percent) of 83 cases had specimens tested by qPCR; 12 (63 percent) specimens were positive for _M. pneumoniae_ and were cultured, yielding 10 isolates identified as _M. pneumoniae_. No other pathogens were identified. All 12 qPCR-positive specimens tested negative for macrolide resistance by qPCR testing of the primary specimen or isolate. Radiographs were administered for 99 percent of students with pneumonia diagnoses; 61 (74 percent) had radiographic findings consistent with pneumonia."

"_M. pneumoniae_ is a common cause of respiratory infection among children and young adults, causing up to 40 percent of all cases of community-acquired pneumonia (2). In rare cases, _M. pneumoniae_ can cause extrapulmonary manifestations, including neurologic, dermatologic, hematologic, and cardiac syndromes. Recommended 1st-line antibiotic treatments include tetracyclines and macrolides; however, a growing trend of macrolide-resistance worldwide has been reported (2,3). Outbreaks largely occur in closed and semiclosed settings, including schools and universities (4-6).

"The outbreak of _M. pneumoniae_ at the Georgia Institute of Technology is the largest reported at a US university in 35 years (1). _M. pneumoniae_ has been implicated in other pneumonia outbreaks at universities (5) and is recognized as a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia among university students (4). These outbreaks can be prolonged because of the long incubation period (up to 3 weeks) (2). Because _M. pneumoniae_ infection most commonly causes upper respiratory illness (only an estimated 3-10 percent of persons with infection experience pneumonia [2,3]), infected persons often go about their normal activities and infect others, as in this outbreak. No cases were identified among faculty or staff members, perhaps in part because they generally do not use university health services. The 5 hospitalizations demonstrate the risk for severe complications during substantial outbreaks of _M. pneumoniae_; early outbreak recognition is critical because control measures can limit transmission and complications (3).

"The multiplex qPCR assay was used as the primary testing method in this investigation because of the documented sensitivity and specificity (8), cost-effectiveness, and status as a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-approved testing method. Culture, a less reliable method for _M. pneumoniae_ detection (2), was used in this investigation to obtain isolates that could be further characterized through additional molecular testing methods.

"_M. pneumoniae_ is spread through respiratory droplets; therefore, preventive health behaviors, including proper hand and respiratory hygiene and self-isolation when ill, can limit the spread of disease (3). No data are available to support the use of antibiotic prophylaxis during university outbreaks. Inducing preventive health behaviors among university students requires that they become aware of the outbreak, perceive a personal risk, and know of a behavior that can reduce the risk for infection (10). In a survey of 105 students, 54 percent said they were unaware of the outbreak despite a campuswide e-mail message, social media postings, and posters placed around campus. Among the 46 percent of students who were aware of the outbreak, 79 percent said they would be more likely to engage in preventive health behaviors because of this awareness.

"Effective communications, coupled with university policies that facilitate students staying home and seeking medical care when ill, might reduce transmission of _M. pneumoniae_ and the severe complications that can go with it."
