More than 500 fishermen in Senegal have contracted a mysterious skin disease after returning from sea, a senior government health official said on Thursday [19 Nov 2020].

The men, who come from several fishing towns around the capital Dakar, have been placed in quarantine for treatment, according to Ousmane Gueye, national director of health information and education.

"It's a dermatitis associated with an infectious disease," Gueye told Reuters. "We are checking further and hope to find out soon what it is."

A ministry of health report dated 17 Nov [2020] said the men had "lesions on their faces, extremities, and for some, on their genitals." It added that the men were also experiencing headaches and showing slightly elevated temperatures.

It said a preliminary investigation showed that the 1st case was reported on 12 Nov [2020]. The 20-year-old showed symptoms that included non-generalized vesicular rash, swelling of the face, dry lips and redness of the eyes.

Images shared on social media showed men with swollen and blistered lips, and large pimples on their hands.

The Senegalese navy will be sent to take water samples for analysis, Gueye said.

[This outbreak of skin disease is much more extensive than the original report that ProMED-mail received mentioning 60 cases but 200 people affected (see Undiagnosed skin disease - Senegal: chickenpox susp, RFI 20201126.7974295).

This new report indicates that more than 500 fishermen have contracted a skin disease. Neither this report nor the previous one mentions whether individuals other than fishermen are affected. Although samples were taken for tests, no results were reported above. Chickenpox was suspected initially, and a follow up comment by Dr. T. Jacob John agreed with that provisional diagnosis and doubted that monkeypox was responsible, because the rapid spread and high contagiousness are more like varicella [chickenpox] than monkeypox (see Undiagnosed skin disease - Senegal (02): chickenpox susp. comment 20201127.7976577).

Laboratory tests are needed to rule chickenpox, monkeypox, or something else in or out and establish a diagnosis. - Mod.TY
