[An outbreak] of anthrax has been identified in a village in the Kvemo Kartli region in eastern Georgia, the National Food Agency reports today [3 Aug 2022]. The department received information about the death of 2 head of cattle in the village of Zemo Karabulakh, Dmanisi municipality. Agency veterinarians immediately went to the site, took pathological material, and examined it in the laboratory. "As a result of laboratory tests, the anthrax disease was confirmed," the ministry said in a statement.

The dead cattle were burned and buried, disinfection work was carried out, and preventive vaccination of animals is being carried out along the surrounding perimeter. Also, in agreement with the local government, a quarantine was announced on the territory of Zemo Karabulakh, which means a ban on the movement of livestock, the sale of animals at fairs, and the consumption and sale of livestock products in the quarantine zone.

National Food Agency veterinarians annually vaccinate up to a million animals against anthrax. In 2021, the Ministry of Agriculture of Georgia reported that the incidence of anthrax among animals in Georgia was 90% lower than in 2013.

Anthrax is a dangerous infectious disease that affects domestic and wild animals, as well as humans. Infection of a person is more often carried out by contact (when cutting animal carcasses, processing skins, etc) and by eating foods contaminated with spores, as well as through water, soil, fur products, etc.

From 2022, the state has pledged to pay cash compensation to farmers whose livestock will die from anthrax. To receive compensation, the case of anthrax must be confirmed in the laboratory. Farmers whose cattle have been vaccinated and identified with ear tags can count on compensation. Information about the animal and the farmer must be entered into the electronic identification-registration system.

[Compensating farmers when they report possible cases of anthrax has a history of being very effective in facilitating reporting. Back in the 1960s, the Canadian government knew that there were outbreaks of livestock anthrax, but there were less than minimal reports. They instituted a payment of CAD 500 per case, and suddenly the disease emerged. Reporting farmers also got their cattle vaccinated. This policy played a significant part in the effective control of anthrax and its current sporadic incidence. Croatia will be rewarded with similar success if they maintain this policy.

"Kvemo Kartli is a historic province and current administrative region (mkhare) in southeastern Georgia. The city of Rustavi is a regional capital." (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kvemo_Kartli).
