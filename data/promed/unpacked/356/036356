CDC and public health officials in multiple states are investigating a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Hadar infections linked to contact with backyard poultry.

Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that are part of this outbreak. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC. DNA fingerprinting is performed on _Salmonella_ bacteria isolated from ill people by using a standardized laboratory and data analysis method called whole-genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these sequences that are used to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives investigators detailed information about the bacteria causing illness. In this investigation, WGS showed that bacteria isolated from ill people were closely related genetically. This means that people in this outbreak were more likely to share a common source of infection.

As of 15 May 2020, a total of 97 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ Hadar have been reported from 28 states.

Illnesses started on dates from 26 Feb 2020 to 1 May 2020. Ill people range in age from less than one year to 87 years, with a median age of 37 years; 58% are female. Of 50 people with information available, 17 (34%) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

If antibiotics are needed, some infections related to these outbreaks may be difficult to treat with some commonly recommended antibiotics and may require a different antibiotic choice. WGS of 26 isolates from ill people predicted antibiotic resistance to one or more of the following antibiotics: amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (4%), ampicillin (4%), cefoxitin (4%), ceftriaxone (4%), gentamicin (4%), streptomycin (100%), sulfamethoxazole (4%), and tetracycline (100%). Testing of clinical isolates using standard antibiotic susceptibility testing methods by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory is currently underway.

Investigation of the outbreak

Epidemiologic evidence shows that contact with backyard poultry (such as chicks and ducklings) is the likely source of this outbreak.

In interviews, ill people answered questions about animal contact in the week before they became ill. Of 44 people interviewed, 38 (86%) reported contact with chicks and ducklings before becoming ill. Ill people reported buying poultry from various sources, including agricultural stores, websites, and hatcheries.

Regardless of where poultry are purchased, these birds can carry _Salmonella_ germs that can make people sick. Backyard poultry owners should always follow steps to stay healthy around their birds.

This investigation is ongoing, and CDC will provide updates when more information becomes available.
