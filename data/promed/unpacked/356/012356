Three children were confirmed dead and 16 others were hospitalized after
eating mussels or tahong Tuesday, health officials here said Wednesday.
Two of the fatalities died Tuesday morning and evening and the 3rd
succumbed Wednesday morning, officials said.
Dr. Inocencio Lee of the city health office, said they were now conducting
an investigation into what they initially considered as a case of food
poisoning. Lee said they had alerted the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic
Resources (BFAR) to conduct an examination of shellfish in the area.
Butch Galarosa, city administrator, issued an advisory to the public to
avoid eating shellfish pending results of the BFAR and the Department of
Health investigations.

[It is possible this could be a red tide or paralytic shell fish poisoning,
but there is not enough information here to make an accurate assessment. We
look forward to an official update. - Mod.TG]
