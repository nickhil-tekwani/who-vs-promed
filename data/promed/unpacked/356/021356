A 15 year old boy died of [a] hantavirus [infection] in Oran [Salta province]. The uncle of the victim said that "on Tuesday [11 Aug 2015], around 3:00 in the afternoon, he told me that he was ill. I went to the hospital and spoke with the doctor, who told me that with the symptoms he [the boy] presented and his [the doctor's] experience, it was [a] hantavirus [infection]. [The boy] died at 16:30 hrs [4:30 pm]."

The uncle said that on the previous day, his nephew went for a walk with his dogs and a friend in the El Canaveral neighborhood, where he contracted the disease. He also stated that due to the fever he had, the boy drank a lot of water, but that was detrimental since his lungs were filling with liquids.

"These are things that occur due to lack of policies and firm decisions. We live in a subtropical area where we have hantaviruses, dengue, leishmaniasis and many other things we don't know about," said the uncle. "It is [scandalous] that there isn't a fence so that the kids don't go through the [dense] cane growth, which also exists near the houses. Because of deforestation, the [rodents] don't have anywhere to go and come into the city," he stated, and complained that the hospital there was a delay in the boy's receiving attention. And finally the uncle demanded that the Ministry of Health adopt measures to avoid this type of situation.

[There is a clear need for public education in the affected community about hantaviruses, the illness that they cause, their epizootiology, and the measures needed to avoid infection. Unless the reporting of the circumstances of the above case is inaccurate, the boy would not have become infected and subsequently died within a day or so following his walk in the cane fields, as his uncle stated. The boy must have had the early symptoms of his infection several days before his acute pulmonary symptoms developed, which apparently were the 1st indication the uncle had that the boy was seriously ill. If the boy died with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome within less than 2 hours of coming to the hospital, it was too late to save his life.

As mentioned in the previous posts of cases in Salta province, the hantavirus involved in these cases is likely Oran hantavirus, which occurs in north western Argentina in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_. Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved in any of these cases. However, the public in these endemic areas needs to be informed about the need to keep their houses and out-buildings free of rodents, and to avoid places were they might come in contact with rodents and their feces, urine or saliva. There is little that the Ministry of Health could do, other than inform the public of the measures needed to prevent exposure to the virus.
