A 3-year-old child died in Lahj province in the south of Yemen early
on Wednesday [25 Jun 2008] due to dengue fever, reported local
sources.

The sources also said that many people in the area are suffering from
fever, with symptoms similar to those of dengue fever, including
strong headaches, dizziness and red eyes.

Official sources stated that 115 Yemenis were officially confirmed as
dengue fever patients from among 1903 suspected cases found in
different provinces of the country since the beginning of this year
[2008].

Recently, 3 Yemenis died, most probably because of this epidemic in
the province of Shabwa, in the east of the country, as stated by an
official report released on Tuesday [24 Jun 2008] and carried by the
state-run news agency Saba.

"Until now, we cannot confirm 100 percent that the 3 people died
because of this disease," the deputy Minister of Health, Majed
al-Junaid said to Saba News Agency.

A total of 64 people were confirmed as dengue fever patients in the
eastern province of Hadhramout, 35 cases in the southeastern province
of Shabwa, 9 cases in the western coastal province of Hodeidah, 4
cases in the southern province of Lahj, and 3 cases also in the
southern province of Abyan.

[The dengue outbreak in Yemen continues (see the 9 Jun 2008 ProMED
archive no. 20080609.1831). A report published in the Yemeni
newspaper Al-Ayyam website on 21 Jun 2008 (in Arabic, accessible
through its web site
<http://www.al-ayyam.info/>)
indicated that official reports and private clinics of Shabwah
Governorate still register daily dozens of people infected with
dengue fever. Medical reports note that the governorate has
registered 1500 infection cases distributed among Hatib directorate,
with 1150 cases; 250 in Mayfa'ah; and 100 in Al-Sa'id and Nisab
directorates. There is no mention made of control measures being
taken in the Yemen Observer report.

ProMED thanks Michelle Sellors <michelle.sellors@masta.org> for
sending in the Al-Ayyam report.

A woman has died of dengue at a hospital in the 1st fatal case due to
the disease in the capital this year [2008].

"The present climate, which is between 28 to 30 deg.C with high humidity,
is conducive to breeding of the _Aedes_ mosquito," said Bir Singh,
professor of community medicine at the All India Institute of Medical
Sciences (AIIMS). "This particular climate helps them thrive and
transmit the disease. But once temperatures start dipping down from
November, the mosquito dies."

A total of 550 dengue cases and one death were reported in Delhi last
year [2007]. According to MCD [Municipal Corporation of Delhi], the
rains have resulted in an increase in mosquito breeding. The
department claims to be holding regular meetings with resident
welfare associations of the 272 wards and NGOs [non-governmental
organizations] to create awareness about the disease. The MCD has
also been educating teachers and children in primary schools about
precautionary measures.

Temephos, an insecticide that can help prevent breeding of the
_Aedes_ mosquito, is being distributed free of cost by MCD [Temephos
at one percent is used in containers of non-potable water for control
of _Aedes aegypti_ larvae and pupae. Periodic reapplication is
required for long-term control. Other control measures are required
for control of breeding sites in water for human use. - Mod.TY].

Dengue fever in the lower parts of Central Java is endemic, and the
number of patients is increasing. This report mentions a doubling of
the number of dengue patients in Central Java in 2007 compared to
2006. In 2006, deaths resulting from dengue reached 220, and the
figure increased in 2007 to 329 people.

According to Dr. Dwi Heri of the Health Authority, in examining the
dengue case data, the disease is spreading in various areas. The
dangerous illness increased not only in the number of sufferers but
also in the number of deaths.

The number of sufferers also increased from 10 924 in 2006 to 20 565
sufferers in 2007.

The Ministry of Health on [24 Jun 2008] continued warning of the
spread of dengue fever in southern provinces.

The past week witnessed a report of over 1400 dengue fever patients
in 27 locations, 4 of whom died, raising the total number of cases to
19 859 so far this year [2008], including 20 deaths.

Provinces with the highest numbers of patients are Ho Chi Minh City
3754 cases/2 dead, Soc Trang 1717 cases/1 dead, Tien Giang 1489
cases/1 dead, and Ca Mau 1123 cases/3 dead. Hanoi has had nearly 100
cases.

The Health Ministry noted that though the total number of patients is
less than last year's [2007] figure, the disease could spread even
more widely as the rainy season has come.

[A total of 19 859 dengue cases and 20 deaths have been reported in
Viet Nam in 2008. There were 12 064 dengue cases with 11 fatalities
reported in an earlier posting 2 weeks ago, on 11 Jun 2008 (see prior
PRO/MBDS posting Dengue - Viet Nam (05) 20080612.1865).

According to the newswire above, while the number of cases of dengue
reported to date this year (2008) is approximately the same as the
number of cases of dengue reported during the same time frame last
year (2007), there were more than twice the number of deaths
attributable to dengue in this period in 2007. There were almost 20
000 cases and 21 deaths of dengue fever detected by 22 Jun 2007 (see
prior PRO/MBDS posting Dengue - Viet Nam (07) 20070622.2025).

3 deaths due to dengue were reported among 911 cases diagnosed with
the disease nationwide between 15-21 Jun 2008.

A statement issued by the Health Ministry's Disease Control Director,
Datuk Dr Hasan Abdul Rahman, said although there was a drop in the
number of cases from the previous week, it was still 27 percent
higher than the targeted figure of 717 cases [It is not clear how the
targeted figure was calculated. - Mod.TY].

He said Selangor reported the highest number of cases at 412,
followed by Kuala Lumpur (98 cases), Kelantan (60 cases) and Johor
(57 cases).

The Health Ministry and the local authorities, he said, had
distributed 78 919 pamphlets and 2849 posters on dengue, especially
in high-risk areas, and had conducted 413 dialogue sessions, 19 146
demonstrations and 12 809 discussions to enlighten the public on the
disease.

"However, cooperation from the public is still low, with 67 percent
of the premises -- comprising residential buildings and shops that
are checked by the Health Ministry and the local authorities -- found
to be breeding grounds for _Aedes_ mosquitoes," he added.

He said a total of 352 compound notices, [with fines] worth RM 50 400
[USD 15 652], and 454 notices to clean up the premises were issued to
respective owners last week.

In Bahia, 32 cities declared a state of alert due to dengue and
exactly when the number of cases should be falling.

Since the beginning of the year [2008], 900 cases of dengue were
recorded in Itabuna, in southern Bahia. In several places, the
[government] agents found much garbage and uncovered [water] tanks
[breeding sites for the _Aedes_ dengue virus vector mosquito. -
Mod.TY].

In Presidente Dutra [town], in central-west Bahia, for every 5
residents, one already has had the disease. In 2008, more than 30 000
cases were recorded throughout the state, representing an increase of
over 224 percent in relation to the same period of last year [2007].

The 32 cities that are in a state of alert recorded the most severe
cases of the disease. This year [2008], 6 people died of DHF in Bahia.

According to Epidemiological Surveillance, the failure to fight
[dengue] outbreaks during the summer has allowed the rain of recent
weeks to provoke a rapid proliferation of mosquitoes and disease
[dengue virus transmission], in a time when the number of cases should
be decreasing.

In Salvador [the state capital], the situation is no different. The
strike of health workers last year [2007] and early this year [2008]
stopped the work on combating outbreaks of mosquitoes that transmit
the virus, which has spread. From the beginning of the year [2008]
until now [mid-June 2008], 1900 dengue cases were recorded [in
Salvador]. More than half the cases were concentrated in 4 districts,
and the health posts continue full.
