[1] Covid-19 Vaccine Trials in Africa

On 17 Aug 2020, screening began for participants to enroll in the mid-stage study of an experimental COVID-19 vaccine by Novavax, a US drug developer of next-generation vaccines for serious infectious diseases, at Witwatersrand University (Wits) in Johannesburg, South Africa. A USD 15 million grant towards the trial was awarded to Novavax by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. 2665 healthy adults and nearly 240 medically stable, HIV-positive adults will be enrolled.

"The major motivation for COVID-19 vaccines being evaluated at an early stage in South Africa is to generate evidence in the African context on how well these vaccines work in settings such as our own," says principal investigator of the Novavax clinical trial Shabir Madhi, Wits Professor of Vaccinology.

"The clinical trial will enable informed decision-making when advocating for the adoption of this NVX-CoV2373 vaccine candidate or other COVID-19 vaccines in African countries, once they are shown to be safe and effective," says Madhi, also executive director of the South African Medical Research Council Vaccines and Infectious Diseases Analytics (VIDA) research unit at Wits.

The trial is the 2nd one in South Africa, with a 3rd trial for Ad26.COV2-S, a Johnson & Johnson product, set for September 2020. The 1st trial, also led by Madhi, of a COVID-19 vaccine in South Africa commenced on 23 Jun 2020, which was the 1st vaccine candidate to be tested in Africa. This trial (Ox1Cov-19 Vaccine VIDA trial) is in collaboration with Oxford University and the Jenner Institute.

Additional vaccine research in Africa is already in the pipeline. Oxford University is awaiting final clearance to conduct clinical trials in Kenya. Uganda's Vaccine Research Institute, led by Professor Pontiano Kaleebu, is aiming to start a vaccine clinical trial in December 2020, in collaboration with the Imperial College London.

Vaccine development and trials emerged as a key research priority for COVID-19 in Africa, after a consultation was released in April 2020, led by the African Academy of Sciences (AAS) based in South Africa and the African Union Development Agency (formerly known as NEPAD), involving more than 600 researchers and policy makers.

Africa, similar to all other parts of the world, faces a pandemic of uncertain duration. Health systems in Africa are particularly overstretched, and the social measures to limit transmission are placing a heavy socioeconomic burden on vulnerable populations, says Kevin Marsh, AAS senior advisor. "Vaccines offer a way of potentially bringing this situation to an end," says Marsh. "Historically, Africa has too often been a passive recipient of vaccines developed and tested elsewhere. African researchers and policy makers want to play a leading role in the international effort to develop vaccines, and it is essential that potential vaccines be trialed in the populations in which they are intended to be used," he told the Lancet Respiratory Medicine.

"Testing vaccines on the continent ensures that sufficient data are generated on the safety and efficacy of the most promising vaccine candidates for the African population so they can be confidently rolled out in Africa once approved," says Dr Richard Mihigo, coordinator for Immunization and Vaccine Development at the WHO Africa Regional Office. "This is by no means the 1st vaccine to be developed or tested in Africa," he says, noting the conjugate meningitis A vaccine, launched in 2010, that underwent clinical trials in several African countries and has since been used to immunise more than 300 million people. "The Ebola vaccine, which was also tested in Africa, has helped to end the Democratic Republic of the Congo's largest Ebola outbreak," adds Mihigo.

One study observed a "critical need for competency to conduct clinical trials in sub-Saharan Africa because the biological, economic, and sociopolitical factors associated with the emergence of diseases, epidemics, and pandemics are over-represented in many countries of the region."

Mihigo says, "the competency is there as clinical trials in Africa are being performed according to international standards, following strict WHO guidelines, which include ethical guidelines requiring informed consent for anyone participating in the trials. As a continent, we've come a long way in building an infrastructure for monitoring vaccine trials. Still, there are never any guarantees; there is a possibility for some flaws in implementation. But there is no reason to expect that trials taking place anywhere in Africa would be less ethical or less effective than in any other part of the world," Mihigo added.

"There is no difference in the rigour accounting for ethical issues in vaccine trials in Africa compared with other continents," Marsh agrees. Over the last 20 years, African researchers have conducted many vaccine trials to international standards and have taken into account complex contextual issues.

In the quest to provide appropriate vaccines to its people, in July 2020 the African Union (AU) launched a new consortium to bring together global vaccine developers, funders, and African organisations that conduct clinical trials. The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Consortium for COVID-19 Vaccine Clinical Trial (CONCVACT) aims to ensure that more than 10 late-stage COVID-19 vaccine trials are conducted in Africa to gather enough data on the safety and efficacy of vaccine candidates among African populations.

"It is critically important for academics, researchers, and the private sector to work together and use all available platforms for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, which will enable Africa to regain momentum for achieving the goals of the continental integration agenda," said Moussa Faki Mahamat, AU chairperson.

The AAS Clinical Trials Community states that only 2% of clinical trials globally, for all types of vaccines, take place in African nations and the WHO Africa Region. At the end of August 2020, Africa had surpassed one million cases of COVID-19, an indication of the need to have vaccines tested on relevant populations. According to WHO, as of 29 Aug 2020, there are 33 COVID-19 vaccine candidates under clinical evaluation, of which 2 are in Africa.

"The sponsors of these vaccine trials will need to readily find trial sites that have the capacity, capability, and experience to generate high quality data that could be included in regulatory dossiers that will be assessed by the international scientific and regulatory community," says Colin Pillai, programme consultant for the AAS Clinical Trials Community. "These trials need to be conducted in geographical areas with laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19," Pillai explains, adding that the AAS is actively collaborating with the Africa CDC to help with this process via its clinical trials community platform. "This is an online resource that is a one-stop source of an online, comprehensive, transparent, and accessible database that promises to be a single source of information on African clinical trial sites and their capabilities, as well as the regulatory and ethical landscape to guide decision making by stakeholders," he says.

"The good news is that so-called ready-now trial sites already exist in multiple countries across the continent. There is also an expectation that sponsors will help build capacity at the sites that do not currently have the expertise or the infrastructure to conduct these types of trials," says Pillai.

On the implications of the 2 trials currently underway in Africa, Marsh says they will provide key data on how the vaccine performs in populations that have the most need of protection from COVID-19. However, given the urgency of the situation, with a large number of potential approaches and a lack of clarity on which vaccine will be best suited, it is important that larger trials are conducted in diverse populations across the continent. "The more trials we conduct, the more chances we have of finding an effective vaccine," says Mihigo. He adds that it is important to evaluate as many vaccines as possible, because researchers cannot predict how many will turn out to be viable.

African scientists are playing a critical role in the design and implementation of these vaccines trials, and this will definitely increase the capacity of the region to contribute to the global search for vaccines in the response against the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Other research for COVID-19 treatment is ongoing in Africa," says Mihigo. For example, a trial is underway in South Africa to investigate the effectiveness and safety of using plasma from people who have recovered from COVID-19 as a treatment for patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Researchers from the University of Cape Town are working with the South African National Blood Service and the Western Cape Blood Service on this effort.

The Africa CDC Consortium proposes the dismantling of crucial barriers to clinical trials through establishing partnerships with leading vaccine developers to host selected late-stage trial sites in Africa, identifying countries where opportunities for trials are most promising, and setting up an independent review board for guidance. But, as Amira Elfadil Mohammed, Commissioner for Social Affairs at AU says, "getting a vaccine is not an end in itself. There is [an] urgent need for global solidarity, cooperation, and appropriate regulation to ensure equitable access to a potential COVID-19 vaccine."

[2] Cytokine Levels in Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients
Date: Thu 3 Sep 2020
Source: JAMA [abridged, edited]
https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2770484?guestAccessKey=42ba7c9d-f33b-4af8-984b-0ffcfe2a82ea&utm_source=silverchair&utm _medium=email&utm _campaign=article_alert-jama&utm_content=olf&utm_term=090320


An abnormally strong proinflammatory response known as a "cytokine storm" may play an important role in the pathophysiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), although cytokine storm remains ill defined. Sinha and colleagues reported that although IL-6 levels are elevated in severe COVID-19, they are lower than levels usually observed in (non-COVID-19) acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, this comparison is limited by the use of different assays, which are not well standardized. We compared cytokine levels in critically ill patients with COVID-19 vs levels in patients with other critical illnesses.

Methods
All patients in this study were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Radboud University Medical Center. Plasma concentrations of the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-6, and IL-8 were determined in consecutive mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 with ARDS (partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio under 300; sampled within 48 hours after ICU admission), bacterial septic shock with or without ARDS (sampled within 24 hours after septic shock diagnosis), out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA; sampled within 24 hours after ICU admission), and multiple traumas (sampled within 24 hours after trauma). The patients with sepsis and trauma are part of larger published cohorts, whereas data of 14 patients with OHCA were previously published. Sampling occurred between 2010 and 2020 (Table). Patients with immunological insufficiencies were excluded, defined as chronic/concomitant use of immunosuppressive medication, chemotherapy/radiotherapy in the last year or in the past for (non-)Hodgkin lymphoma, or humoral/cellular deficiencies. Cytokines in all cohorts were determined using the same methodology (Milliplex assay, Millipore, on a MAGPIX instrument, Luminex Corporation) by the same technician using the same protocol.

Patient characteristics were analyzed using Fisher exact or Kruskal-Wallis tests followed by Dunn post hoc tests. Cytokine data are presented as geometric means (95% CIs) and analyzed using 1-way analysis of variance on log-transformed data followed by Dunnett post hoc tests. Data were analyzed using Graphpad Prism version 8.3.0 (Graphpad Software). A 2-sided P less than .05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
There were 46 patients with COVID-19 with ARDS, 51 with septic shock with ARDS, 15 with septic shock without ARDS, 30 with OHCA, and 62 with multiple traumas. There were no significant differences in sex or age between patients with COVID-19 and other patient groups (Table). Patients with COVID-19 had a higher body mass index and prevalence of diabetes than patients with OHCA and trauma. In COVID-19, cardiovascular insufficiency was more common, overall disease severity and leukocyte counts were lower, and lung injury was more severe compared with the other groups.
Levels of all 3 cytokines were significantly lower in patients with COVID-19 than in patients with septic shock with ARDS; the geometric means were 22 pg/mL (95% CI, 18-27) vs 40 pg/mL (95% CI, 30-55) (P less than .01) for TNF; 48 pg/mL (95% CI, 35-66) vs 376 pg/mL (95% CI, 190-744) (P less than .001) for IL-6; and 27 pg/mL (95% CI, 23-33) vs 215 pg/mL (95% CI, 133-347) (P less than .001) for IL-8 (depicted in the Figure on a log scale). Patients with COVID-19 also displayed significantly lower IL-6 and IL-8 concentrations compared with patients with septic shock without ARDS (Figure). TNF levels in patients with COVID-19 were higher than those in trauma patients, whereas no differences between patients with COVID-19 and OHCA or trauma were present for IL-6. For IL-8, lower concentrations were found in patients with COVID-19 compared with patients with OHCA, while no differences vs the trauma group were observed.

Discussion
In this study, critically ill patients with COVID-19 with ARDS had circulating cytokine levels that were lower compared with patients with bacterial sepsis and similar to other critically ill patients. These findings are in line with lower leukocyte counts observed in patients with COVID-19, and are possibly due to lower overall disease severity, despite the presence of severe pulmonary injury. The findings of this preliminary analysis suggest COVID-19 may not be characterized by cytokine storm. Whether anticytokine therapies will benefit patients with COVID-19 remains to be determined. Limitations of the study include the small sample sizes, single center involved, and the use of different lots of the same assays without data on lot-to-lot variability.

[In many patients who become critically ill, the SARS-COV-2 virus triggers a hyperinflammatory response characterized by excessive cytokine release, often referred to as a "cytokine storm." Molecules such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1, IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, interferon (IFN)-y inducible protein, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, macrophage inflammatory protein 1A and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a cause widespread damage, with the cytokine storm proportional to the severity of COVID-19. When produced in huge quantities, these pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-6, generally correlate with respiratory failure and mortality. This phenomenon has been associated with severe outcomes in patients infected with other pandemic /novel viruses including SARS-CoV1 and influenza A/H5N1.

These mediators are part of a well-conserved innate immune response necessary for efficient clearance of infectious agents. Distinguishing an appropriate from a dysregulated inflammatory response in the pathophysiology of critical illness, however, has been a major challenge.

Furthermore, the manifestations of elevated circulating mediators in the purported cytokine storm lead to endothelial dysfunction and systemic inflammation leading to fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension. This set of symptoms already has a long history in critical care, and is described with sepsis or systemic inflammatory response.

As reported in the above study on a limited number of patients, the situation in critically ill patients with COVID-19 is complex with lower circulation levels of at least 3 cytokines as compared to other critical patients. Understandably, the impact of monoclonal antibody therapy such as use of sarilumab, tocilizumab, etc., as well as Interleukin-6 receptor inhibitors is, therefore, unclear and equivocal at best and not recommended https://www.covid19 treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/immune-based-therapy/ immunomodulators/interleukin-6-inhibitors/.

There are ongoing studies using "antibody cocktails" for addressing COVID-19 cytokine storms, https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0634-9, but further information and clinical research are required before the best options for COVID-19 treatment at various levels of illness can be recommended. - Mod.UBA]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

Data by country, area, or territory for 5 Sep 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesSept5_1599398671.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 44.4% of daily case numbers and 57.4% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, maintaining its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 13.8 million cases. Brazil and the USA are dominant, followed by Argentina, Colombia, Peru, and Mexico.

- The European region reported 15.5% of daily case numbers and 9.1% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 4.4 million. Spain is dominant, followed by France, Russia, Ukraine, Israel and Germany.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 5.1% of daily case numbers and 5.3% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of greater than 1.9 million cases. Iraq remains the dominant country, followed by Iran, Morocco, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia.

- The African region reported 1.9% of daily case numbers and 5.7% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and have reported more than one million cases. While South Africa remains the dominant country, the numbers have been lower than in previous days and weeks, followed by Ethiopia, Botswana, Algeria, Kenya, Nigeria and Zambia.

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.6% of daily case numbers and 2.2% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.5 million cases. The Philippines continues to dominate, followed by Japan and South Korea.

- The South East Asia region reported 31.5% of the daily newly reported cases and 20.0% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 4.5 million cases. India continues to dominate followed by Indonesia and Bangladesh.

Europe, while experiencing resurgences in many countries related to loosening restrictions and the summer vacation period, is overshadowed by the major transmission ongoing in South East Asia, specifically India.

[The USA, Brazil, and India are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations. In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (90 600), followed by the USA (42 095) and Brazil (31 199) -- account for over half of all confirmed cases globally (54.2%) and 60.8% of all newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. A global total of 4822 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (4-5 Sep 2020).

Countries reporting more than 5000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours include India, USA, Brazil, Spain (not reported), Argentina (9924), France (8550), Colombia (8394), Peru (6854), Mexico (6196), and Russia (5205), and 27 countries have reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is a decrease of 0.9%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 2.4%.

Impression: Unchanged from recent days. The European region is seeing increasing cases in western European countries that had markedly reduced transmission in late spring. Spain did not report case numbers in the last 24 hours. The most severely affected region remains the Americas. - Mod.UBA
