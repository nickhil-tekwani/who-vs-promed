Foot-and-mouth [disease] outbreaks revisit Quang Ngai
-----------------------------------------------------
Quang Ngai Province in the central region could be facing a serious
foot-and-mouth [disease] outbreak following the death of 52 cows in
the last 3 weeks, a province agriculture officer said Monday [24 Aug
2009].

Dao Minh Huong, deputy director of Quang Ngai Department of
Agriculture and Rural Development, said the disease had reoccurred in
the province earlier this month [August 2009] but the residents tried
to conceal it.

Huong said 52 cows of 23 families of Son Tinh District had died from
the disease in the past 20 days, adding that the province animal
health authority is localizing the outbreaks.

Also on Monday [24 Aug 2009], the district government fined 5
families, each VND 2 million (USD 112), for trading cows without
certificates of origin, leading to the recurrence of the disease.

This year as of late June [2009], nearly 2700 cattle and 110 pigs had
contracted foot-and-mouth disease nationwide including Quang Ngai.

The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development stipulated that a
city or province will be pronounced safe from an animal disease if no
new cases are reported after 21 days.

The ministry's Animal Health Department in June [2009] said livestock
epidemics were under control but warned that the diseases would recur
and localities should have their cattle vaccinated, while the
transport and slaughter of livestock should be closely supervised.

[According to the data of the World reference laboratory for FMD
(Pirbright), the FMD's status in Viet Nam is 'endemic.' Reportedly,
the following serotypes have been identified there throughout the years:
FMDV-O: 1956, 1967, 1969, 1997, 1999-2009;
FMDV-A: 2004-2006;
FMDV-Asia 1: 1992, 2005-2009.

Genotyping data of the Vietnamese strains of the said 3 serotypes are
available at
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/asia/vit.htm>.

According to PRO/MBDS posting 20081218.3973, FMD virus serotype A
reappeared, after its absence since 2006, during December 2008 in the
central province of Nghe An and was subsequently detected also in the
province Ha Tinh in the central region and in the provinces of Yen Bai
and Thai Binh in the north. A further spread of this recurring
serotype, into the provinces Long An (south Viet Nam) and Kon Tum
(central Viet Nam), was reported in January 2009 (see ProMED-mail
posting 20090122.0273). Information about the serotype identified in
the current outbreak will be helpful. In case this is serotype A, it
will be interesting to check its genetic profile, compared to the
strain identified in 2006.
