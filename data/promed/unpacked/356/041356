The National Coordination centre for travel Health and the National
Coordination Structure for Infectious disease Control in The Netherlands
were made aware of a case of yellow fever imported into the Netherlands in
January. The diagnosis was confirmed on the 16th of February.
It concerns a 35 year old male who lives in The Netherlands. He visited
Suriname where he traveled in the interior and coastal areas. He has not
been outside Suriname as far as we know. He returned to the Netherlands
around the 9th of January and fell ill on the 12th of January. He was
admitted to hospital in The Hague where he recovered and was recently
discharged.
Blood was tested on the 19th of January and the diagnosis was confirmed on
the 16th of February at the WHO reference centre in Rotterdam. IgG and IgM
against yellow fever virus were found positive, dengue serology was negative.
The case was reported to WHO.
As soon as more information becomes available we will let you know.

[Owing to distance, this case must be completely unassociated with the
recent YF cases in Brazil. It would be useful and informative to know
whether this patient had been vaccinated before he left The Netherlands for
a yellow fever endemic area. Also, whether the diagnosis was made using a
single serum (presumptive) or paired serum samples or virus isolation
(confirmed) would be helpful. People vaccinated with attenuated yellow
fever virus (17D) produce high titer IgM antibody to the virus.
Excellent that the W.H.O. has been informed. Can the Surinamese Government
provide additional information about this case and about the endemicity of
YF in Suriname? Much work was done there many years ago but I have seen
nothing recently. - Mod.CHC
