The 1st case is a 50 year-old female who had been suffering from chronic diseases and is currently receiving medical care in the intensive care unit.

[These 2 newly confirmed cases will bring the global total of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection to 96 including 46 deaths. These are the 1st MERS-CoV infections confirmed and reported since 3 cases were confirmed in Saudi Arabia on 1 Aug 2013 (see ProMED-mail posting MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (51): Saudi Arabia, WHO, RFI 20130801.1857286 and the WHO update from 1 Aug 2013 at http://www.who.int/csr/don/2013_08_01/en/index.html). In the interim, there were media reports of a possible fatal case of MERS-CoV infection in a South Korean national travelling in Saudi Arabia, but there was no confirmation of such an infection from official sources.

These 2 newly confirmed cases fit the profile of the majority of cases reported from Saudi Arabia -- individuals with known comorbidities. At present the route of transmission for the majority of these apparent sporadic cases remains unknown. These cases will increase the number of laboratory confirmed cases in Saudi Arabia to 76 including 39 deaths.
