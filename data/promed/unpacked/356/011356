A Nepalese worker in his 20s died from a tickborne disease earlier this week, the South Chungcheong provincial government said on Tuesday [1 Aug 2017].

The 24 year old man, who had been working at a livestock farm in Hongseong, a town in South Korea's central province of South Chungcheong [officially Chungcheongnam-do], was diagnosed with severe fever and thrombocytopenia syndrome, or SFTS, and treated for the disease before he died on Sunday [30 Jul 2017].

According to local government officials, the worker visited the emergency room of a nearby hospital on 24 Jul [2017] complaining of fever, chills and loss of appetite. He was transferred to a general hospital in Cheonan, a city in the same province, the same day as he showed symptoms of fever and thrombocytopenia [low blood platelet count].

The provincial government has reported 14 cases of the illness so far this year [2017], and 5 of them died.

SFTS is a new infectious disease confirmed in South Korea, Japan and China. South Korea has seen cases of the disease increasing. The number of people infected with the disease was 36 in 2014, 55 in 2014, 79 in 2015 and 79 in 2016, with the death toll reaching 17 in 2013, 16 in 2014, 21 in 2015 and 19 in 2016.

There is currently no effective medicine to treat the disease, and the best policy against it is to avoid being bitten by ticks.

[Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) is endemic in East Asia, including Korea. The transmission season in Korea is well under way this year (2017), with 14 cases reported above. The virus is transmitted by the scrub or bush tick _Haemaphysalis longicornis_, which was discovered in South Korea around 30 years ago. The man was likely exposed to the tick while working on a livestock farm. With no vaccine available, avoidance of tick bites is the only preventive measure available.

SFTS virus is a phlebovirus in the Bunyavirus family. Characterization of the virus responsible for SFTS was described first in 2011: Yu XJ, et al. Fever with thrombocytopenia associated with a novel bunyavirus in China. N Engl J Med. 2011 Apr 21;364(16):1523-32 (http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1010095).
