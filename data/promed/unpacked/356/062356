Connecticut state health officials have issued a warning for the public in shoreline areas about the potential dangers of exposure to salt or brackish water along Long Island Sound, due to an unusually high number of _Vibrio vulnificus_ infections.

Since July 2020, 5 cases of _Vibrio vulnificus_ infections have been reported to the Department of Public Health (one infection in July 2020, 4 in August 2020). The patients are from Fairfield (1), Middlesex (1), and New Haven (3) counties and are between 49-85 years of age (median 73); 4 are male, one female. Two patients had septicemia (infection of the bloodstream), and 3 had serious wound infections. All 5 patients were hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

All 5 cases reported exposure to salt or brackish water during activities such as swimming, crabbing, and boating. All 5 patients had pre-existing wounds or sustained new wounds during these activities, which led to the _Vibrio_ infections.

_V. vulnificus_ infection is an extremely rare illness. In the past 10 years, between 2010-2019, only 7 cases were reported in Connecticut.

_V. vulnificus_ can cause wound infections when open wounds are exposed to warm salt or brackish water (mix of salt and fresh water). The bacteria, once inside the body, can infect the bloodstream causing septicemia. People with a _V. vulnificus_ infection can get seriously ill and need intensive care or limb amputation. About one in 5 people with this type of _Vibrio_ infection die, sometimes within a day or 2 of becoming ill. People at greatest risk for illness from _V. vulnificus_ are those with weakened immune systems and the elderly.

You can reduce your chance of getting a _Vibrio_ wound infection by following these tips:
- If you have a wound (including from a recent surgery, piercing, or tattoo), stay out of saltwater or brackish water if possible. This includes wading at the beach.
- Cover your wound with a waterproof bandage if it could come into contact with saltwater, brackish water, or raw or undercooked seafood and its juices. This contact can happen during everyday activities, such as swimming, fishing, or walking on the beach.
- Wash wounds and cuts thoroughly with soap and water after they have contact with saltwater, brackish water, raw seafood, or its juices.

[The increased number of cases of this and similar diseases in more northern areas is a direct effect of global warming.

The following is extracted from the "Bad Bug Book," Center for Safety and Applied Nutrition, US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) at
http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/UCM297627.pdf#page46:

"_Vibrio vulnificus_, a lactose-fermenting, halophilic, Gram negative, opportunistic pathogen, is found in estuarine environments and associated with various marine species such as plankton, shellfish (oysters, clams, and crabs), and finfish. Environmental factors responsible for controlling numbers of _V. vulnificus_ in seafood and in the environment include temperature, pH, salinity, and amounts of dissolved organics. It may be normal flora in saltwater, and acquiring this organism from shellfish or water exposure does not imply that the water is contaminated by sewage.

Wound infections result either from contaminating an open wound with sea water harboring the organism, or by lacerating part of the body on coral, fish, etc. followed by contamination with the organism. The ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in gastroenteritis."

The "primary septicemia" form of the disease follows consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals with underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease. The organism can also enter through damaged skin. In these individuals, the microorganism enters the bloodstream, resulting in septic shock, rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50%). Over 70% of infected individuals have distinctive bullous skin lesions (shown at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5508923/).

There are 2 points to be emphasized: firstly, vibrios are normal flora in warm saltwater (not indicative of any sewage contamination) and, secondly, most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. So-called normal individuals often just develop gastroenteritis. The range of disease due to _V. vulnificus_ may involve more northern geographical areas as overall global warming takes effect. - Mod.LL
