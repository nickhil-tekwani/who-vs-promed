Two Potomac horse fever cases in Tennessee
------------------------------------------
On [6 Jul 2022], the Tennessee State Department of Agriculture reported 2 cases of Potomac horse fever.

A yearling Miniature Horse filly in DeKalb County began showing signs on [1 May 2022] and was confirmed positive on [6 Jul 2022]. She had been lethargic for the past 2 months and presented with fever, anemia, and anorexia. The filly is currently still affected and alive.

A 12-year-old Tennessee Walking Horse mare in Rutherford County was also confirmed positive on [6 Jul 2022]. She presented with dehydration, severe diarrhea, and toxemia (toxins in the blood) and is now deceased.

Both horses had unknown vaccination statuses, and neither private facility has enacted a quarantine.

About Potomac horse fever
-------------------------
Potomac horse fever is caused by _Neorickettsia risticii_, an organism found in parasites, called flukes (flatworms), which infects aquatic snails and insects. Horses can be infected by ingesting insects carrying Potomac horse fever or by drinking water containing _N. risticii_. Additionally, horses can get Potomac horse fever by inadvertently consuming infected insects or parasites in feed, water, or on pasture.

The incubation period for Potomac horse fever is between 1 and 3 weeks, and the mortality rate is up to 30%. While vaccines against Potomac horse fever are not 100% effective, vaccinated horses tend to have fewer and less severe clinical signs.

Most Potomac horse fever cases are reported in July through September, and outbreaks tend to be seasonal.

Horse owners and caretakers, especially those who keep their horses near creeks and rivers, should watch for signs including:
- Diarrhea
- Colic
- Loss of appetite
- Lethargy
- Toxic shock
- Dehydration
- Abortion in pregnant mares
- Laminitis
- Mild to severe fever

[The most common name for the disease is Potomac horse fever but other names include equine monocytic ehrlichiosis, equine ehrlichial colitis, and acute equine diarrhea syndrome.

"Potomac horse fever (PHF) is a non-contagious, infectious equine disease caused by the rickettsial organism _Neorickettsia risticii_ (previously known as _Ehrlichia risticii_). The disease can affect any age, breed, or sex of horse. PHF cases usually occur in summer and fall, but may occur in any season depending on weather conditions.

"Clinical signs
They are highly variable and include:
- High fever up to 107 deg F (41.6 deg C) reported. Fevers may occur 7-14 days before signs of colitis develop
- Diarrhea: variable, ranging from absent to severe
- Depression
- Anorexia
- Lethargy
- Laminitis (with or without diarrhea) may progress from mild to severe
- Mild to moderate colic
- Decreased gastrointestinal sounds
- Edema of limbs and ventral body, and the prepuce of males
- Abortion (by transplacental transmission)

"Note: concurrent infections with _Salmonella_ have been documented.

"Incubation period
Approximately 1-3 weeks.

"Risk factors
- Housing near (within approximately 5 miles [8 km]) a freshwater stream, or river, or on irrigated pasture in endemic areas
- Nighttime use of barn lights which attract parasitized insects

"Transmission
- Oral ingestion of trematodes present in aquatic insects (caddisflies, mayflies, damselflies, and dragonflies)
- Whole blood transfusion from an infected donor
- Transplacental (across the placenta to the foal)
- Exposure to freshwater or operculate snails (Note: Affected horses are not considered to be contagious by natural contact with other horses.)

"Confirmed PHF cases are not considered to be contagious. The organism is not known to be free in the environment but is instead harbored by certain aquatic insects and snails.

"Diagnosis
May be made by PCR [polymerase chain reaction] or IFA [immunofluorescent assay], depending on what type of sample is submitted to the testing laboratory.

"Post-mortem
Gross necropsy findings in the acute stage of PHF disease include:
- Distended large colon and cecum filled with watery contents
- Mucosal hyperemia and ulceration (may be widespread)
- Hyperplasia of lymphoid follicles and lymph nodes
Aborted fetus lesions include:
- Increased content within the small and large intestine
- Hepatic discoloration

"Submission of tissues for microscopic examination is indicated to facilitate a definitive diagnosis.

"Specific control measures
Routine isolation and disinfection guidelines should be followed, including appropriate disposal of manure.

"In situations where insect attraction has occurred fouling horse feed and water, keep barn lights off where practical to discourage insect travel from water habitats.

"Release of animals from isolation
- Any diarrheic horse should be isolated until the cause can be established
- Co-infection with additional contagious agents is possible in _N. risticii_-infected horses, therefore a comprehensive fecal diagnostic investigation should be undertaken.
- If PHF is proven to be the only cause of the observed illness, isolation protocols can be relaxed as it is not considered a contagious disease.

"Biosecurity issues for receiving animals:
Diarrheic horses should be isolated as a matter of routine until contagious causes can be ruled out and normal feces are produced"
