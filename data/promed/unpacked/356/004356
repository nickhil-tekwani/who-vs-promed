More than 140 000 people have been infected with hand-foot-mouth disease [HFMD] and 6 died from the disease in China this year [2018], according to China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

As of 20 Apr 2018, a total of 141 978 cases had been reported, with 6 deaths and 581 in critical condition. The disease incidence rate was lower than the same period of last year [2017], the CDC said in a statement.

Zhang Jing, researcher with the CDC, said HFMD was a common infectious disease that usually affects infants and children younger than 5 years old.

During the peak season for HFMD, from April to June, the CDC said measures are needed to closely monitor and prevent transmission of the disease, especially at primary schools and kindergartens.

Qian Suyun, doctor at Beijing Children's Hospital, reminded parents and teachers to take children to hospital as soon as they show symptoms such as fever, vomiting, irritation, and limb weakness.

The disease can be transmitted through close contact with excreta and respiratory secretions, among others.

[See ProMED mail Hand, foot & mouth disease update (02): Caribbean (Cayman Islands) 20180221.5641051 for a discussion of this generally mild disease.

Complications affecting the brain, lung, or heart may occur in rare cases where the infection is caused by a more severe virus strain. Complications include viral or "aseptic" meningitis (https://www.cdc.gov/meningitis/viral.html), but it is rare. It causes fever, headache, stiff neck, or back pain and may require the infected person to be hospitalized for a few days. Encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) or polio-like paralysis can occur, but this is even rarer. - Mod.LK
