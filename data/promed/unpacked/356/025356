Activists and residents from Kabkabiya locality, North Darfur, have informed Radio Dabanga on Tuesday 20 Nov [2012], about the alleged arrival of 4 new cases of a disease resembling yellow fever from Jebel 'Aamer and Sref Beni Hussein localities.

The patients were taken to the hospital in Kabkabiya for treatment, but remain in critical condition, sources told Radio Dabanga. A local resident said one of the patients was referred to the hospital in El-Fasher but died during the trip.

The resident explained that another patient passed away on Monday [19 Nov 2012], as a result of the disease. At the same time, one of the remaining patients was taken to El-Fasher hospital on Tuesday morning [20 Nov 2012], after his condition became more critical.

He stressed that residents are living in fear, as the disease can cause a sudden death, adding that doctors withhold information on the patients' conditions from their relatives, which causes even more fear and panic, he added to Radio Dabanga from Kabkabiya.

[Yesterday's previous yellow fever (YF) report (see ProMED-mail archive no 20121121.1418557) gave numbers of cases and fatalities in West, Central, and South Darfur. The report above mentions suspected YF cases from North Darfur, underscoring the widespread geographic distribution of the outbreak, and the challenge in getting adequate vaccination coverage sufficient to halt transmission over this very extensive area.
