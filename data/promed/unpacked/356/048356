New Mexico: San Juan County Resident Contracted West Nile Virus in Oklahoma
--------------------------------------------------
A resident of Northwestern New Mexico has been treated and released
from a Stillwater Area Hospital after being diagnosed with West Nile
virus infection. The 62-year-old man was fishing in Oklahoma and
after feeling ill was admitted to a hospital. The man had a positive
presumptive test performed by the Oklahoma Department of Health
Laboratory.

On 22 Aug 2002, New Mexico became the 40th state to confirm the
presence of West Nile virus. West Nile virus has been confirmed in 13
counties in New Mexico including Bernalillo, Curry, DeBaca, Quay,
Roosevelt, Lea, Colfax, Union, Chaves, Eddy, San Miguel, Socorro, and
Sandoval. "If the history of the disease in other states is an
indication, if not this year, then next, we may have our first human
case of West Nile Virus that originates in New Mexico," New Mexico
Department of Health Secretary Jack Callaghan said. "Even though the
mosquito season is slowing, in some areas of the state it is still
warm. It is still important for residents to take personal
precautionary steps," he added.

Most mosquitoes do not carry the virus and most people bitten by a
mosquito have not been exposed to the virus. Less than one out of 150
people who are bitten by an infected mosquito get severely ill,
according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
"It is important for New Mexicans to realize that even though we have
not had a confirmed positive case of West Nile virus in a human,
other states have had several cases," Department of Public Health
Veterinarian, Paul Ettestad said. "From the description of the case
and the timing, it appears that the exposure happened while the New
Mexico resident was in Oklahoma."

West Nile virus was first identified in the United States in New York
City in 1999. According to the CDC, as of today, 3391 laboratory
positive cases have been identified in humans and 188 people have
died as a result of the disease. There have been no
laboratory-confirmed tests in humans in New Mexico. More information
is available on the New Mexico Department of Health website:

West Nile Virus Direct Transmission: Bird-to-Bird; Bird to Human?
------------------------------------------------
Ever since West Nile virus first reached the United States in 1999,
health authorities have assured an anxious public that they could not
get sick from contact with dead or dying birds, only from the bite of
mosquitoes that carry the virus from birds to people. That's still
the official word from the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.

Although there remains no scientific proof that sick birds can infect
people directly, some scientists and others who work with birds say
their experiences suggest otherwise. "I think it is possible that
people could get it," said Nicholas Komar, a vertebrate ecologist at
the CDC. "There is plenty of virus being shed by some species of
birds. When we make the statement that people are not known to be
infected directly (by infected birds), it doesn't mean people can't
get infected. It simply states what we know and don't know. People
need to take precautions and avoid risky behavior. And handling a
sick bird with bare hands and no respiratory protection is risky
behavior." Health officials advise people to use precautions such as
gloves, plastic bags or shovels when they handle dead birds. And
natural-resources officials have urged hunters to wear gloves, to
wash up carefully after cleaning or handling game, and to thoroughly
cook their kill.

Those advisories are now being underscored. "Whether it's a virus
like this or any other infection, it (West Nile) has brought back to
the forefront the things people should be doing all the time," said
Mark Shieldcastle, a wildlife biologist with the Ohio Department of
Natural Resources. "It should be part of a hunter's daily way of
life." In New York last year, a young technician was cut during a
bird necropsy. Days later he was hospitalized with West Nile virus.
After a second person was cut this year, the state's wildlife
pathologist, Ward Stone, ordered everyone in his lab to wear
stainless-steel mesh gloves sandwiched between 3 or 4 layers of latex
gloves, in addition to the customary masks, face shields and gowns.
It slows down their work by half. But with thousands of infected
birds under the knife, and no vaccines or other treatments to rely
on, Stone said "the procedures are important."

Although American crows have been hit hardest, birds from more than
110 species have been felled by the virus, including game species:
wild ducks, Canada geese, pheasants, turkeys, pigeons, doves, and
grouse. When hundreds, perhaps thousands, of owls, hawks and eagles
in the Midwest fell ill with West Nile during the summer, there was
speculation that they might have been infected by eating smaller
birds slowed by the infection. That has not been proved; the raptors
might simply have been bitten by infected mosquitoes. But there is
growing evidence that West Nile virus might be spread in other ways.

In 2000, scientists at the National Wildlife Health Center in
Madison, Wis., infected 9 crows with the West Nile virus in the
laboratory. The birds were then placed in a mosquito-free flight room
with 7 healthy crows. The birds all shared common food, water and
perches. All the infected birds were dead 8 days later, and the
previously healthy crows began to sicken and die. In a follow-up
study recently submitted for publication in a scientific journal, the
CDC's Komar repeated the experiment with 18 different species of
birds. "We were able to document direct transmission in 4 of those,"
he said - American crows, black-billed magpies, blue jays and
ring-billed gulls. The healthy birds began to test positive for the
virus after 5 or 6 days of exposure to the infected birds. "We don't
know exactly what the mode of transmission was," Komar said, "but we
know it wasn't by mosquito bite." Other studies have suggested some
answers. Birds that touch or feed each other, share perches, or come
into contact with each other's feces might become infected that way.
