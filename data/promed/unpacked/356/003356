Since the last update on 12 Apr 2019, 47 more ill people were added to this outbreak. As of 23 Apr 2019, 156 people infected with the outbreak strain of _E. coli_ O103 have been reported from 10 states. CDC is reporting the 156 illnesses that the PulseNet laboratory network has confirmed are part of this outbreak. States are investigating additional illnesses that might be a part of this outbreak.

State / Ill People
Florida / 3
Georgia / 33
Illinois / 1
Indiana / 1
Kentucky / 65
Minnesota / 1
Mississippi / 1
Ohio / 8
Tennessee/ 41
Virginia / 2
-----------
Total 156

Illnesses started on dates from 1 Mar 2019 to 7 Apr 2019. Ill people range in age from less than 1 year to 83 years, with a median age of 19. 50 percent are female. Of 127 people with information available, 20 (16%) have been hospitalized. No deaths and no cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome have been reported.

Illnesses that occurred after 26 Mar 2019 might not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill with _E. coli_ and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2-3 weeks.

This multistate investigation began on 28 Mar 2019, when officials in Kentucky and Georgia notified CDC of this outbreak. Preliminary epidemiologic information suggests that ground beef is the source of this outbreak.

In interviews, ill people answered questions about the foods they ate and other exposures in the week before they became ill. Of the 114 people interviewed, 92 (81%) reported eating ground beef. This percentage is significantly higher than results from a survey of healthy people. Ill people bought or ate ground beef from several different grocery stores and restaurants. Many ill people bought large trays or chubs of ground beef from grocery stores and used the meat to make dishes like spaghetti sauce and sloppy joe.

USDA-FSIS and state regulatory officials are continuing their traceback investigations to determine the source of raw ground beef supplied to grocery stores and restaurants where ill people reported eating. At this time, no common supplier, distributor, or brand of ground beef has been identified. Consumers should follow steps to handle ground beef safely and cook it thoroughly.

CDC will provide more information as it becomes available.

K2D Foods, doing business as (DBA) Colorado Premium Foods, a Carrolton, Ga. establishment, is recalling approximately 113 424 pounds of raw ground beef products that may be contaminated with _E. coli_ O103, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today, 23 Apr 2019.

The raw ground beef items were produced on 26 and 29 Mar, 2, 5, 10, and 12 Apr 2019. The following products are subject to recall: [View Labels (PDF only)]:

Two 24-lb. vacuum-packed packages in cardboard boxes containing raw "GROUND BEEF PUCK" with "Use Thru" dates of 4/14/19, 4/17/19, 4/20/19, 4/23/19, 4/28/19, and 4/30/19.

The products subject to recall bear establishment number "EST. 51308" inside the USDA mark of inspection on the boxes. These items were shipped to distributors in Ft. Orange, Fla. and Norcross, Ga. for further distribution to restaurants.

FSIS and its public health partners, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Tennessee Department of Health, have been investigating an outbreak of _E. coli_ O103. Unopened, intact ground beef collected as part of the ongoing investigation from a restaurant location, where multiple case-patients reported dining, tested positive for _E. coli_ O103. At this time, there is no definitive link between this positive product and the ongoing _E. coli_ O103 outbreak. Further traceback and product analysis continues to determine whether the recalled products are related to the _E. coli_ O103 outbreak.

Many clinical laboratories do not test for non-O157 EHEC, such as O103 because it is harder to identify than O157:H7. People can become ill from EHECs 2-8 days (average of 3-4 days) after exposure to the organism.

Most people infected with serotype O103 develop diarrhea (often bloody) and vomiting. Some illnesses last longer and can be more severe. Infection is usually diagnosed by testing of a stool sample. Vigorous rehydration and other supportive care are the usual treatment; antibiotic treatment is generally not recommended. Most people recover within a week, but, rarely, some develop a more severe infection. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a type of kidney failure, is uncommon with EHEC O103 infection. HUS can occur in people of any age but is most common in children under 5 years old, older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. It is marked by easy bruising, pallor and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately.

FSIS is concerned that some product may be in refrigerators or freezers of restaurants. Restaurants that have purchased these products are urged not to serve them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify that recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website at http://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160 F [71 C]. The only way to confirm that raw ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature.

[At this point, ground beef is being implicated as the source of this ongoing outbreak. Adequate cooking and appropriate kitchen hygiene could have minimized the number of cases. - Mod.LL
