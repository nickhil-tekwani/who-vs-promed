Indian health experts have been alarmed by rising numbers of _Aedes
aegypti_ mosquitoes, the key vector of yellow fever, around sea- and
airports. Experts are concerned that the virus may be introduced into India
if precautions are not taken. India and other Asian countries have so far
been free from the virus, which is found in Africa and South America.
Studies by the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) and the
National Anti-Malaria Programme in different parts of India have pointed
towards this increasing trend.
Under the International Health Regulations of 1969, all international
airports and seaports should be kept free from larvae and adult mosquitoes
and their index should be less than 1%. K S Gill and colleagues from the
NICD note that the first _Aedes aegypti_ survey in 1948 in Calcutta,
Chennai, Cochin, and Vishakhapatnam ports indicated the presence of _Aedes
aegypti_ only in Calcutta.
According to a report by India's NICD, the larval premises index at
international seaports increased from 8.8% in 1997 to 29.6% in 2000 in
Calcutta, from 0% in 1964 to 22.8% in 1999 in Chennai, and from 0% in 1961
to 12.19% in 1995 in Bombay. The larval index has also been rising at
international airports: from 0% in 1978 to 26.9% in 2000 in Calcutta, 13.5%
in 1998 to 38.8% in 1999 in Chennai, 0% in 1956 to 9.2% in 1995 in Bombay.
In Delhi, it rose from 0% in 1977 to 60.7% in 2000.
Experts point out that yellow fever could be introduced to India through
the unnoticed arrival of any subclinically infected patient or mosquitoes
infected with yellow fever [virus carried on aircraft or ships. NICD
officials claim that it is the responsibility of the civil aviation and
seaport authorities to keep the mosquito populations in check. They also
say that India, with an unvaccinated and susceptible population, is a
yellow fever "receptive area". _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes are seen in
abundance in both urban and rural areas. "The only missing link in the
chain of disease transmission is the yellow fever virus," stated K K Datta,
director of NICD.
"This situation is a cause of serious concern," a senior WHO official in
Delhi told The Lancet. "Given the eastward movement of the virus, we are
very concerned about the introduction of yellow fever into this part of the
world," he added. "The _Aedes aegypti_ population in India is definitely
increasing," said Datta. "If this rising trend is not checked via regular
monitoring, the chance of introduction of yellow fever will increase," he
added.

[Dr P Badrinath submitted this news item in order to pose the following
question. "Are there any previous instances where yellow fever has gained a
foothold in countries/areas where it has never occurred before?" Answers to
ProMED-mail please, so that we can all benefit from the knowledge. As a
starter, Jack Woodall has provided the following information. In the 19th
century yellow fever broke out in ports in England, Spain, France & Italy,
the West Indies, Central America, and the USA -- Philadelphia (20
epidemics), New York (15), Boston (8), Baltimore (7), New Orleans (1905:
5000 cases/1000 deaths). Ref: Strode GK et al. Yellow Fever. NY:
McGraw-Hill, 1951. The only thing that stopped yellow fever from becoming
endemic in the USA and Europe were the cold winters that killed off the
_Aedes aegypti_. The disease came to South America from Africa in slave
ships and became established in monkeys (of which India has many). - Mod.CP
