I refer to the posting HENDRA VIRUS, HUMAN,
EQUINE - AUSTRALIA (QUEENSLAND) (02): NOT Archive
Number 20070831.2871 Published Date 31-AUG-2007.
You requested some more information ".... If
anybody has information about the autopsy results
on the horse and the diagnosis of the sick
trainer, we would still be interested to know. - Mod.JW ..."
After consultation with our veterinary and human
health colleagues in Queensland, I offer the following additional information:
The most recent confirmed case of Hendra virus in
a horse in Queensland occurred in July 2007. This
has been confirmed by the Queensland Department
of Primary Industries and Fisheries. Details of
this case are that a mare was euthanized by a
private veterinarian and a limited autopsy was
performed by a government veterinarian in
collaboration with the private veterinarian on 18
Jul 2007 (as per established guidelines for
autopsies where Hendra virus infection is suspected).
Checks with Queensland Health confirm that no
cases of Hendra virus infection have been reported in humans since 2004.

[ProMED appreciates this official clarification.
It appears that there was one confirmed equine
case of Hendra infection in July this year
(2007), not 2, and that the trainer was not a
case. However, in view of the fact that the
symptoms of the autopsied horse and its trainer
were apparently severe enough (respiratory
symptoms?) that Hendra infection was suspected,
we would still be interested to know If anybody
has information about the final diagnosis of those cases. - Mod.JW]
