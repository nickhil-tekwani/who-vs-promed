Diagnosis: when a sudden high mortality rate occurred and when the 1st
cases of adult rabbits (alive or dead) were received in early December 2004
with a known clinical history, clinical examinations were carried out as
well as epidemiological and laboratory research (anatomopathological
examinations and haemagglutination test with human erythrocytes), which led
to a positive diagnosis for rabbit haemorrhagic disease.
Control and surveillance measures adopted to date:
- A disease emergency was declared in the provinces of Havana City and
Havana, and a disease alert including extreme vigilance measures was issued
in the rest of the country.
- Epidemiological surveillance and information campaigns were stepped up
nation-wide.
- A ban was declared on the movement of rabbits in and around the outbreaks.
- Stringent measures were applied in and around the outbreaks and the
necessary sanitary measures were adopted, both to prevent the disease from
spreading and to protect major rabbit production centres in the country.
Note by the OIE Animal Health Information Department: the Delegate of Cuba
to the OIE has been requested to provide further information on the outbreaks.
