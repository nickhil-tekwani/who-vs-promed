A serious _E. coli_ [O157:H7] outbreak in central New Jersey has led
to 11 confirmed cases and at least 6 suspected cases over the past 2
weeks. The victims, from towns in Middlesex, Somerset and Monmouth
counties, are primarily children, though 2 adults also have been
infected, said Middlesex County Director of Health David Papi.
In the 2 most serious cases, the victims have developed hemolytic
uremic syndrome, or HUS, a serious condition that can cause permanent
kidney damage. Those victims, along with 4 others, remained
hospitalized last night [2 Dec 2006], Papi said. "This is a
significant outbreak of a serious disease, and a significant amount
of people are ill," he said, calling the magnitude of the outbreak
uncommon.
Investigators have yet to determine the source of the outbreak,
though a Taco Bell restaurant on Stelton Road in South Plainfield is
suspected. Nine of the 11 confirmed victims ate at the Taco Bell, and
on Thu 30 Nov 2006, the fast food restaurant agreed to voluntarily
shut down until the source is identified, Papi said.
An inspection of the restaurant last week did not reveal any
significant health code violations, Papi said, but investigators are
still waiting on the results of stool tests run on 21 Taco Bell
employees.
Health officials were also awaiting test results on the 6 suspected
cases, 2 of which were reported just yesterday [2 Dec 2006]. The 1st
confirmed case was reported on 17 Nov 2006, Papi said. Since then,
cases have been confirmed in Edison, Woodbridge, Atlantic Highlands,
Franklin Township, Piscataway, New Brunswick and Monroe Township.
The oldest victim so far is 23, while the youngest is just a year
old. The victims have been treated at John F. Kennedy Medical Center
in Edison, Saint Peter's University Hospital in New Brunswick and
Newark Beth Israel Medical Center in Newark, Papi said.
Papi said initial food samples sent from the South Plainfield Taco
Bell to the state Department of Health have tested negative for the
organism, though investigators are still assembling a list of common
foods eaten by several victims. Two other eateries, a local diner and
another Taco Bell, also have been inspected but remain open with no
evidence of contamination, Papi said.

[It is not yet proven that the fast food restaurant was indeed the
source of the organism. Likewise, if the restaurant source is
confirmed, it is yet to be determined which food was the vehicle,
although ground beef would be high on the list. The reader should
recall that the organism was 1st clearly recognized as a cause of
significant human illness related to fast food restaurant-related
clusters in 2 states in the USA in 1982 (Riley L, Remis R, Helgerson
S, et al. Hemorrhagic colitis associated with a rare _Escherichia
coli_ serotype. N Engl J Med 1983;308: 681-85). - Mod.LL]
