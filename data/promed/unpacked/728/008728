Cases of swine dysentery have continued to rise in the second quarter of 2019 according to the latest report from the Animal and Plant Health Agency (Apha), with another outbreak confirmed earlier this month in Norfolk.

Data from Apha's pig disease surveillance dashboard shows 19 cases between January and October this year [2019], making up more than 3% of all diagnoses.

Diarrhoea and wasting continue to be the main clinical signs reported, with the disease occurring mainly but not exclusively in pigs of grower to finisher age.

The latest case in Norfolk is suspected to have been present for 10 days, but the only clinical sign was looseness, according to AHDB.

Strict biosecurity and biocontainment measures are now in place and the unit will be depopulated. The exact origin of the outbreak is currently unknown and is under investigation.

AHDB said: "If you have recently moved pigs from Norfolk please monitor them closely for the development of any clinical signs of enteric disease and notify your vet immediately if you observe any suspect diarrhoea. It is important a heightened level of biosecurity and monitoring for clinical signs are observed over the next few weeks, especially within the Norfolk region."

According to National Pig Association (NPA) chief executive Zoe Davies, there are probably more cases of dysentery than are being reported, with some, but not all, being recorded on the Significant Diseases Charter. She said: "It is clear that there is a lot more dysentery out there than we think. It is important that we know where it is."

The charter, which is free of charge, requires English producers to notify Apha of swine dysentery or PEDv outbreaks. There is a separate charter in Scotland which all member of the Quality Meat Scotland (QMS) assurance scheme are signed up to.

In the event of an outbreak all producer signatories and their vets receive the first half of the affected postcode, along with the planned course of action, but the identity of the producer concerned is not shared with charter members or external bodies.

Because of growing concerns about under-reporting of the disease, the NPA Producer Group and the Pig Veterinary Society have both put forward a proposal for the Significant Diseases Charter to be compulsory under Red Tractor.

[Swine dysentery (SD; also known as "bloody scours") is a mucohemorrhagic diarrheal disease of pigs that affects the large intestine. Its essential causal agent is _Brachyspira hyodysenteriae_, an anaerobic spirochete that produces a hemolysin, although other organisms may contribute to the severity of lesions. It is endemic in many pig-rearing countries, where control is limited by the lack of effective vaccines and by the emergence of _B. hyodysenteriae_ strains with reduced susceptibility to common antibiotics.

SD is not included in OIE's international list of notifiable diseases. The disease is of concern for the UK pig-farming farmers/industry in view of its potential to cause serious losses when widely spreading due to deficient biosecurity and less-than-optimal transparency.
