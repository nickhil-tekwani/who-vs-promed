Monkeypox, Cameroon
-------------------
Information received on [and dated] 18 Jul 2014 from Dr Gaston Djonwe, directeur des services veterinaires, Services Veterinaires, Ministere de l'Elevage, des Peches & des Industries Animales, Yaounde, Cameroon

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 2 Jun 2014
Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 15 Jul 2014
Reason for notification: emerging disease
Morbidity: 8.3 per cent
Mortality: 1.4 per cent
Zoonotic impact: 1st occurrence of a zoonotic disease in wildlife. No human cases associated with the outbreak.
Causal agent: Monkeypox virus
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks: total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Mbinang, Minta, Haute Sanaga, Centre
Date of start of the outbreak: 2 Jun 2014
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: not applicable
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Common chimpanzee: _Pan troglodytes_ (Hominidae) / 72 / 6 / 1 / 1 / 0
Affected population: A group of 6 adult chimpanzees in a 3-hectare enclosure. The sanctuary has a population of 72 animals distributed over a 90-hectare area divided in several fenced enclosures.
Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]:
Species / morbidity rate / mortality rate / case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Common chimpanzee: _Pan troglodytes_ (Hominidae) / 8.3 / 1.4 / 16.7 / 2.8
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: The group of 6 chimpanzees (5 sick and 1 dead) lived in a 3-hectare enclosure isolated from other compartments in the sanctuary. Clinical signs were lack of appetite and gradual appearance of vesicles and nodules on the forelimbs and on the face. The sanctuary is populated by chimpanzees over a 90-hectare area. It is compartmentalized and closed. There is no recent introduction of animals in the sanctuary. Quarantine has been applied (sick animals are kept in the enclosure) and biosecurity measures are strengthened for personnel working in this enclosure. Identification by the laboratory of poxvirus Congo Basin strain.

Control measures
Measures applied: quarantine; disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Global Viral-PREDICT, Cameroon (private laboratory) / Common chimpanzee / gene sequencing / - / Pending
Global Viral-PREDICT, Cameroon (private laboratory) / Common chimpanzee / real- time PCR / 15 Jul 2014 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

["Monkeypox is a zoonotic viral disease that can infect nonhuman primates, rodents and some other mammals.

"Monkeypox results from infection by the monkeypox virus, a member of the genus _Orthopoxvirus_ in the family Poxviridae (subfamily Chordopoxvirinae). Two clades of monkeypox viruses, the West African and Congo Basin viruses, have been identified. The Congo Basin viruses are more virulent. Monkeypox virus is closely related to some other orthopoxviruses such as variola (smallpox) virus, and it cannot be distinguished from these viruses in some laboratory tests.

"Monkeypox is endemic in central Africa (the Congo Basin) and West Africa. An outbreak of human monkeypox occurred in the US in 2003. In the US, cases were seen in pet prairie dogs, other small mammals in captivity, and people who had been exposed to infected prairie dogs. There have been no reports of infections among humans or domesticated animals in North America since 2003, and limited surveys suggest that the virus probably did not enter wild animal populations.

"Most cases of monkeypox in humans are zoonotic. This virus is thought to be transmitted to people in bites from animals, in aerosols during close contact, or by direct contact with lesions, blood or body fluids. In Africa, human outbreaks have often been linked to handling, preparing and eating wild animals. In the US, most cases occurred among people who had close direct contact with prairie dogs; some infections were apparently acquired in scratches and bites, or through open wounds. Human-to-human transmission can also occur. Potential routes of transmission between people include contact with skin lesions or infectious body fluids, or aerosol transmission during prolonged face-to-face contact.

"The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends disinfection of contaminated surfaces with 0.5 percent sodium hypochlorite or other EPA-approved high-level disinfectants. Incineration or autoclaving is appropriate for some contaminated materials. Burial without decontamination is not recommended."

For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to the fact sheet "Monkeypox" (last updated in February 2013), prepared by the Center for Food Security and Public Health, Iowa State University, available at http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/monkeypox.pdf.

ProMED-mail thanks Giuseppe Michieli <gimi69@libero.it> for sending a copy of this OIE report.

The outbreak in the USA was traced to pet shops with recently imported rodents from Africa. Since no sign of the disease has been reported in chimps in neighboring compartments of the sanctuary, it is likely that it was introduced by rodents. Getting rid of infected rodents may be an impossible task, since poison could be eaten by the chimps and live traps would be interfered with by the curious apes. - Mod.JW
