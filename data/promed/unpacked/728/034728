Outbreak of Norovirus-associated Gastroenteritis on Alaskan Cruise Ship
-------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of stomach illness has been reported among passengers and crew
on the Star Princess cruise ship sailing between Seattle and Alaska. A
total of 107 passengers and 14 crew members suffered vomiting and diarrhea
from the common Norovirus during the current 7-day cruise, said Tom Dow, a
spokesman for Princess Cruises in Seattle. No one was hospitalized.
"There's no indication that it's food or water," said Dave Forney, chief of
the vessel sanitation program for the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta. He said the illness is usually brought on board by a
passenger and spreads easily in close quarters. The outbreak was at its
worst on Monday and Tuesday and then decreased, Dow said. 5 passengers and
2 crew members were sick yesterday out of a total of 2800 passengers and
1100 crew, he said.
Norovirus, the CDC's name for Norwalk-like viruses, causes vomiting,
diarrhea, and some stomach cramps over one or 2 days. It's usually not
serious, although people who are very young, elderly, or have weakened
immune systems might become dehydrated and need medical attention.
The ship was sailing yesterday between Ketchikan, Alaska, and Victoria,
B.C., and was due to arrive today in Seattle. Dow said the virus was
diagnosed on board. The ship was cleaned using antibacterial agents, he
said. Precautions were taken, including serving passengers rather than
using buffet lines, placing hand-sanitizing dispensers in food areas, and
notifying passengers to wash their hands frequently.

[In previous years, outbreaks of viral gastroenteritis due to norovirus
infection have been a recurrent feature of cruises to Alaska and in the
Caribbean region. In the present instance, increased awareness of the
problem as a result of past experience and the rapid implementation of
control measures appear to have enabled the outbreak to be contained at
sea. Consequently the number of cases was small compared to the size of
population at risk; the calculated attack rate is 3.1 percent -- 121 cases
out of 3900 people on board). This should provide some reassurance for
those contemplating an Alaskan cruise in the near future. - Mods.MPP/CP]
