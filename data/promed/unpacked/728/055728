The number of deaths in the New York City legionnaires' disease outbreak is up to 4; 71 cases of the flu-like disease have been reported since mid-July [2015] in the South Bronx, up from 31 on [Thu 30 Jul 2015], the city Department of Health and Mental Hygiene said [Sun 2 Aug 2015].

The 4 victims [who died] were all older adults with additional underlying medical problems, the city said. 55 individuals are hospitalized.

"We are conducting a swift investigation to determine the source of the outbreak and prevent future cases. I urge anyone with symptoms to seek medical attention right away," Dr Mary Bassett, commissioner of the health department, said on [Thu 30 Jul 2015]. The department's probe includes testing water from potential sources in the area.

So far, 5 buildings in the outbreak cluster, including a hospital [Lincoln Hospital] and a hotel [Opera House Hotel], have tested positive for traces of the _Legionella_ bacteria. Remediation is complete at 4 of the 5 locations, the city said. [The 3 other positive sites are: The Concourse Plaza Mall, Streamline Plastic Co, and Verizon building (http://7online.com/health/4th-person-dies-from-legionnaires-disease-in-south-bronx/897860/).]

"The New York City water supply does not pose a risk, so people should continue to feel confident in drinking tap water to stay cool during this period of hot weather," said Bassett.

At a City Hall press conference Thursday afternoon [30 Jul 2015], Mayor Bill de Blasio warned that anyone with symptoms should get tested, but he said that most New Yorkers are not at risk.

The city health department continues to employ disease detectives to investigate the source of the outbreak and is conducting outreach to vulnerable populations including the elderly and homeless. A town hall discussion between community members and city medical experts entitled "The Facts About Legionnaires' Disease" is scheduled for Monday evening [3 Aug 2015].

Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr said on [Fri 31 Jul 2015] that his office will push for legislation to create a citywide inspection system that would test building water infrastructure for the disease and others. "The city must create a new inspection system for these systems, just as we inspect other critical systems such as elevators," Diaz said in statement.

An estimated 8000 to 18 000 hospitalized cases of legionnaires' disease occurs each year in the United States. An outbreak of the disease in Philadelphia in 1976, largely among people attending a convention of the American Legion, led to its name.

Political leaders and health officials are set to hold a meeting on Monday night [3 Aug 2015] after a 4th person has died due to legionnaires' disease in the Bronx. There are now 65 confirmed cases of the disease since [10 Jul 2015].

After officials found _Legionella_ bacteria there, 5 buildings with cooling towers in the South Bronx have gone through cleaning. City Council members will take part in a town hall meeting and answer questions about the situation.

Streamline Plastics Company on Park Avenue in the Bronx is the last of 5 sites health officials have positively identified as being a possible source of this legionnaires' cluster.

Deputy Health Commissioner Dr Jay Varma expects the number of legionnaires' cases to increase over the next 7 days as they now try to figure out exactly which cooling tower is spreading these bacteria. "We think it is very possible that there will be an increase in cases over the next 7 days. We are also quite confident that after that time, the number of cases will go down," said Varma. "We can never know for sure what the future holds and we are working very aggressively to make sure people at risk -- people in senior centers, people at homeless shelters, people with other medical problems -- get the message to pay attention to their health."

To date city officials have visited 22 buildings in the cluster area, with 5 buildings with cooling towers testing positive for the bacteria. All have gone through thorough cleaning and remediation processes.

"What is most worrisome about this cluster has been the sudden and dramatic rise of cases in a very localized area. We know that from an investigation perspective, that is much easier to crack the case like that, because there must be something in that neighborhood that is making people sick. So I would say it is actually hasn't been frustrating to investigators, what is frustrating is to know that people have been sick, that people have died from an infection that is preventable."

Moving forward all sites will be required to submit long term plans about how they will maintain their cooling towers to protect against any future growth of _Legionella_.

"We are doing the detective work right now to figure out whether it was one tower that was responsible for the infection, or 2, 3, or 5. That detective work will take weeks. But we can be confident that the disinfection we are doing of these 5 towers will reduce the number of infections in the south Bronx," Varma said.

A 3rd building tested positive for _Legionella_ bacteria [Fri 31 Jul 2015] -- the Opera House Hotel in the Mott Haven section of the South Bronx. The general manager of the hotel, Julio Vargas, issued this statement [Fri 31 Jul 2015]: "We have been informed that there were traces of _Legionella_ in the cooling tower. We have taken all necessary precautions. We have called a water treatment company to disinfect the cooling tower. This is isolated to that area and is not affecting any other areas of the hotel. We are taking all necessary steps to protect the health and safety of our guests and staff and are taking all recommendations from the Health Department of New York."

Two other building cooling systems tested positive [Thu 30 Jul 2015] -- the Concourse Plaza Mall on 161st Street and Lincoln Hospital. Officials said no one at the hospital was identified as contracting the disease, only in the neighborhoods around the hospital. The 4 neighborhoods where the outbreak is most prominent are: Highbridge, Morrisania, Mott Haven, and Hunts Point.

Health officials said they identified 20 more cooling towers they want to test in the area to see if they're the source of the bacteria. They released these facts [Fri 31 Jul 2015] about the buildings they've inspected so far:
- 22 buildings visited -- only 17 determined to have cooling towers;
- All 17 have been tested with results back for 11 -- remaining 6 expected Friday evening [31 Jul 2015];
- 3 buildings have tested positive;
- The Opera House Hotel is 3rd location to test positively for _Legionella_;
- Opera House Hotel quickly began remediation efforts Friday afternoon [31 Jul 2015];
- None of the 57 reported cases have stayed at the Opera House Hotel as guests;
- Lincoln Hospital remediation is completed;
- Concourse Plaza remediation is ongoing

A town hall forum is scheduled for [Mon 3 Aug 2015] with Councilmember Vanessa Gibson for residents in the area. "During the course of our actions fighting the legionnaire's disease outbreak in The Bronx, it has been revealed that there is no inspection mechanism for coolant systems, rooftop water tanks, and other standing water infrastructure that could be a breeding ground for this disease and others. The city must create a new inspection system for these systems, just as we inspect other critical systems such as elevators," Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr said. "My office will work with our City Council members and the appropriate agencies to craft new legislation that would deal with this issue in the coming days."

Legionnaires' disease is dispersed through vapor or mist that's ingested [sic]. The word "inhaled", rather than "ingested" was likely meant.] The disease cannot be spread from person to person.

There have not been any concerns about the water supply, health officials said, but it is being tested in the affected areas as a precaution.

Symptoms of the disease include headache, fatigue, loss of appetite, confusion, and diarrhea. These usually appear 2 to 10 days after significant exposure to _Legionella_ bacteria.

[The number of cases of legionnaires' disease in the South Bronx since 10 Jul 2015 has now risen to 71 with 4 deaths. 22 buildings in the South Bronx are said to have been visited; 17 buildings that have cooling towers have been tested for _Legionella_, with results back on 11; 5 buildings are positive for _Legionella_; and the results are pending for 6 other buildings. The positive sites are being remediated.

Genotyping is likely being done on the environmental and clinical isolates to see if there are any matching patterns. Clinical isolates with matching genotypes would suggest a common source for those cases and a cooling tower with an _Legionella_ isolate having a genotype that matches that of the clinical isolates would be the likely source. - Mod.ML
