West Nile fever, Brazil
-----------------------
Information received on [and dated] 23 Jul 2019 from Dr Geraldo Marcos De Moraes, Director, [Department of Animal Health, Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Supply], Brasilia, Brazil

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 11 Jun 2019
Date of confirmation of the event: 19 Jul 2019
Reason for notification: recurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 5 Dec 2018
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: West Nile virus
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Joao Neiva, Espirito Santo
Date of start of the outbreak: 11 Jun 2019
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Equidae / 6 / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Equidae / 16.67 / 16.67 / 100 / 16.67
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: vectors
Epidemiological comments: the outbreak was detected from surveillance actions for nervous syndrome in herbivores. Initially, the sample was tested for herbivores rabies and, in the face of negative results, it was tested for West Nile virus. The official veterinary service continues to investigate cases of mortality of equidae associated with neurological signs.

Control measures
Measures applied: surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Federal Laboratory for Agricultural Defense - LFDA/MG (national laboratory) / Equidae / gene sequencing / 19 Jul 2019 / Positive
Federal Laboratory for Agricultural Defense - LFDA/MG (national laboratory) / Equidae / reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 15 Jul 2019 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

"West Nile fever is a mosquito-borne viral disease that can affect birds, humans, and horses causing inapparent infection, mild febrile illness, meningitis, encephalitis, or death. West Nile virus (WNV) is a member of the genus _Flavivirus_ in the family Flaviviridae. The arbovirus is maintained in nature by cycling through birds and mosquitoes; numerous avian and mosquito species support virus replication. For many avian species, WNV infection causes no overt signs while other birds, such as American crows (_Corvus brachyrhynchos_) and blue jays (_Cyanocitta cristata_), often succumb to fatal systemic illness. Among mammals, clinical disease is primarily exhibited in horses and humans.

"Clinical signs of WNV infection in horses arise from viral-induced encephalitis or encephalomyelitis. Infections are dependent on mosquito transmission and are seasonal in temperate climates, peaking in the early autumn in the Northern Hemisphere. Affected horses frequently demonstrate mild to severe ataxia. Signs can range from slight incoordination to recumbency. Some horses exhibit weakness, muscle fasciculation, and cranial nerve deficits. Fever is not a consistently recognised feature of the disease in horses."
