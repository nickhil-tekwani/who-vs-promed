A case of trypanosomiasis imported from Masai Mara, Kenya was diagnosed in Frankfurt, Germany.

A 61-year-old male patient had returned from Kenya on 28 Jan 2012. Two hours after arrival, he developed a high fever and admitted himself to a local hospital on 29 Jan 2012. Treatment was started for suspected malaria tropica [_Plasmodium falciparum_], and the patient was transferred to Frankfurt University Hospital the following day. Malaria could not be confirmed, but trypanosomes were seen in thick blood stain, QBC and Giemsa. Treatment was started with Suramin.

Clinically, the patient suffered from high fever, cephalgia [headache] and fatigue. There was a marked inoculation eschar [scar from insect bite] on the tibia.

The patient had travelled to Mombasa where he stayed at a beach resort the entire time except for a 2-day excursion to Masai Mara for a safari on 18-19 Jan 2012. The night was spent at a camp. The other member of the travel party does not show any symptoms of trypanosomiasis to date.

[It has been almost 11 years since ProMED-mail last reported on trypanosomiasis in Kenya (see the posting from 11 May 2001 below). At that time, there had been several reports of tourists being infected in the national parks in Tanzania, and the Kenyan authorities reported the spread of tsetse flies to Kenya. The report shows that there is a risk, although small, to tourists in the Kenyan game park. - Mod.EP]

According to Kenya statistics, there were 2.385 million visitors to its Parks & Game reserves in 2009, most from outside Africa -- see:
