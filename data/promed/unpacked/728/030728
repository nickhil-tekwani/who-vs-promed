A man and his cat developed sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD)
simultaneously, report Gianluigi Zanusso and colleagues in a Research letter
in this week's Lancet.
Examinations of brain tissue in both showed a similar prion strain, which
was different from previously reported cases of spongiform encephalopathy in
cats and different from BSE-related conditions. Both had a genetic
constellation of the prion-protein gene more commonly seen in patients with CJD.
Is this a freak coincidence or could these transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies have occurred "as the result of horizontal transmission in
either direction, infection from an unknown common source, or the chance
occurrence of two sporadic forms", the researchers ask.

[ex various media sources, 1 & 2 Oct 1998, edited
The 60-year-old Italian and his pet, which slept on his bed, both contracted
[more likely, 'first showed signs of' - MHJ the same form of CJD in November
1993. The man exhibited symptoms which included poor eyesight and
co-ordination and muscle spasms. His condition deteriorated rapidly and he
died in January 1994. His cat, a seven-year-old neutered female, showed
symptoms of frenzy, twitching, poor co-ordination, and muscle spasms. She
was put down in mid-January, outliving her owner by a week.
Post-mortem examinations showed physical changes in both cat and owner that
were typical of spongiform encephalopathy diseases. Further investigations
showed that the same kind of prion protein that is thought to cause the
diseases was present in both brains, suggesting a possible link.
The prion strain was that which causes sporadic, or spontaneous, CJD in
humans rather than the iatrogenic form associated with human growth hormone
treatment, or the new variant CJD. The features of the cat's illness were
different from previously reported cases of FSE (feline spongiform
encephalopathy).
Neurologists at the University of Verona said the twin cases could have come
from a common source, infection from one to the other, or have been the
result of an extraordinary coincidence. The researchers are reasonably
certain, however, that the man and his cat did not contract their illnesses
by eating the same infected beef, as the prion strains found in their brain
were not those associated with BSE.
Dr. Gianluigi Zanusso and his colleagues are injecting mice with samples of
brain tissue from the man and the cat to confirm it is the same strain of
disease in both. Zanusso said the cat developed behavioral changes and
features that were also different from other reported cases of the feline
disease.

I know no more that I have read in media reports quoted on FSNet.
Apparently strange statistically highly improbable things do happen
quite often. After all, the odds against any individual winning the National
Lottery are phenomenally high, yet each week somebody wins it. Without doing
a search, I have a recollection of a report a year or two ago, of a husband
and wife (was it in Austria?) who both had sporadic CJD. What were the odds
against that? [The diagnosis has been challenged, see refs at top -

Re: "to confirm it is the same strain of disease in both..." is a bit
premature. I would have said "To establish whether or not it is ...."
(but then I'm not a journalist).
But Collinge's Western blot technique would give an answer far sooner.
