The Kyrgyz village of Yntymak (located in the Talas region, northwest of the country) has been quarantined due to an outbreak of anthrax, according to the head of the department of supervision and prevention of infectious diseases.

Quarantine will last until 21 Sep 2013. "These measures are taken to control the movement of farm animals. For 2 weeks, no livestock or poultry may be moved from the village," explained the clerk. According to her, to date, Talas oblast hospital has received 16 people with suspected anthrax. In 2 of these patients, the diagnosis has been confirmed; 5 were negative, and 9 more are awaiting the results of laboratory tests.

The outbreak of anthrax in the Talas region became known in early September 2013. According to the "Evening Bishkek," Manas Moldaliev, the regional center director for general practice, said that on 22 and 30 Aug 2013, the Yntymak villagers killed cattle, and all those who took part in it and took the meat, are now in the hospital.

The animals are believed to have been sick, but none of the villagers showed them to their veterinarian at slaughter or since then. The publication notes that the locals tried to hide the diseased cattle because the state has refused to pay them compensation for their deaths.

Kyrgyzstan's Health Ministry has confirmed the facts of human infection with anthrax in the north of the country.

In early September 2013, 2 male villagers with identical symptoms of the disease were taken to the regional hospital in Talas. According to the results of laboratory tests, for one of the residents from the Buckeye-Ata district, the initial diagnosis was confirmed. Analysis of a 33-year-old man showed that he was infected with anthrax. Later, the diagnosis of the 2nd patient also showed a positive result.

Quarantine has been imposed on the village Yntymak in the Talas region in the north of Kyrgyzstan and will last until 21 Sep 2013; if necessary, its duration will be increased.

Meanwhile, another 16 villagers have been hospitalized with similar symptoms; in 2 of them, anthrax infection was also confirmed. Currently, all diseased cases are isolated, and the others are under close medical supervision. According to the Kyrgyz medics, supplies for anthrax treatment have arrived in the region, and so all patients are receiving treatment.

Just before these cases of anthrax in the north of the country, the head physician of the Center Tokmok Gossanepidnadzora, Dr. Raimbek Nurgaziev, warned of a possible epidemic of anthrax in the city. The main reasons for this un-reassuring prognosis were the lack of chlorination facilities at the wells supplying the city with water.

"Water quality is very poor," said Raimbek Nurgaziev. "Water samples showed deviations from the norm and with excessive levels of bacteria. The authorities plan to install water sterilisation, but when will that be? Even today, the levels of enteric diseases among residents are too high, as are cases of hepatitis. In preparing kebabs, they use water from their wells, hence the danger of the epidemic."

Meanwhile, to date, out of 1238 foci of anthrax in Kyrgyzstan, more than half are in a reasonable state [presumably undisturbed - Mod.MHJ].

[This is a continuation of the previous ProMED-mail posting (archive number 20130905.1926141). So far, there appear to be 4 people with confirmed diagnoses of anthrax; and confirmation is awaiting on 9, and 5 are in the clear.

Anthrax from drinking water is possible but not normally expected for humans. I have included this information as it sheds light on the general human health problems in that oblast.

Talas is in northwestern Kyrgyzstan along the Kazakh border, west of Chuy, and north of Jalal-Abad. For a map of Kyrgyzstan showing Talas, go to: http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/commonwealth/kyrgyzstan_pol_05.jpg. - Mod.MHJ
