H5N9 vaccine is normal says veterinary department
-------------------------------------------------
Head of the Veterinary Department Bui Quang Anh on 7 May [2007] signed a
dispatch on the resumption of the use of the Italian H5N9 vaccine on geese.
This decision was made after the Technological Council of the Ministry of
Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) released the conclusion that the
vaccine was good in quality.
The MARD Technological Council very carefully considered the explanation
and commitment of the Merial company, the Italian producer of the H5N9
vaccine, and the latest testing results of this vaccine and concluded that
the layer-making phenomenon in vaccine jars was normal and did not affect
the quality of the vaccine.
With this conclusion, the veterinary sector will not lose the VND 4.5
billion [USD 280 881] it paid for 9 million doses of the H5N9 vaccine. Some
3.8 million doses remaining in warehouses will be not destroyed and 3.2
million geese will not be vaccinated again because each goose needs 2
injections, which are 21-28 days from each other. If this time is exceeded
the vaccine will lose its effectiveness.
Vietnam now has 8 million geese, a huge source for the spreading of the flu
virus. While chickens and ducks have had flu vaccinations for the past 2
years, there was no vaccine for geese. The Veterinary Institute had tested
their vaccines on geese many times without success. In late 2006 when bird
flu broke out again in the Mekong Delta, the institute tested the H5N9
vaccine of Italy on geese, which showed good results. However, the immunity
time is not long, around 70 days only.
As of early February 2007, H5N9 was begun to be used on geese nationwide.
But 2 months later, while the second injections were being given, some
localities detected a layer-making phenomenon in vaccine jars and in
mid-April [2007] the Veterinary Department decided to halt the vaccinations
on geese.

Vietnam resumes use of Italian vaccine for geese after faults cleared
------------------------------------------------
Vietnam's Ministry of Health Thursday officially permitted the [resumption
of the use of] an Italian vaccine for geese against bird flu after a one
month hiatus. The serum had settled into distinct layers inside sealed
bottles. The move came after experts from the Ministry of Agriculture and
Rural Development analyzed and found that such layering is normal and does
not affect quality. Vietnam had halted the use of the vaccine against bird
flu strain H5N9 after the liquid serum settled into many layers with
different colors.
Merial, the Italian company which sold Vietnam 9 million doses of the
vaccine last year, have protested, saying the bottles must be shaken before
use to blend back the layers, a fact indicated on the bottle instructions.
The Italian medical company added that the vaccine used to be free from
this problem when the company used an ingredient made from animals to
emulsify the serum.
But since 2004, amid mad cow disease fears, the European Union has banned
the ingredient and Merial has been using elements derived from plants
instead. The plant substance causes layering but does not impact efficacy,
Merial said.

[This appears to be some type of separation within the bottle that is not
resulting from a partially used vaccine that has been allowed to be stored.
Perhaps someone from Merial would be kind enough to explain for us. ï¿½ Mod.TG]
