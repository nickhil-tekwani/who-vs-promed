A 50-year-old man who was showing clinical signs of rabies expired early today [14 Jan 2015], taking the official toll of dog-bite-related death to 11, even as there is no let up in the number of new cases, with the cumulative figure since October last year [2014] reaching 263.

T (50), a resident of Mata was brought to the district hospital yesterday [13 Jan 2015], and the hospital Superintendent Dr Arke had maintained that there were very minimal chances of his recovery in a press briefing held at the Deputy Commissioner's office yesterday.

With today's [14 Jan 2015] fatality, the official toll that stood at 10 till yesterday has surged to 11 as another case of dog-bite related death was added to the list as well.

The victim identified as E (46) of Lanva expired sometime in November 2014, and the attending doctors had even made the family wrap the corpse with polythene sheeting and advised them to burn his clothing besides compulsory vaccination of all his relatives.

1.5-year-old T of Hengjang village was reportedly bitten by a dog on 1 Jan 2015 [same name but resident of a different village - Mod.MHJ].

An alarming figure in the official figures that was dispatched to the Principal Secretary (Health) was the large disparity in the number dog-bite cases, as vaccine administered to patients to date stands only at 11 against the reported cases of 263.

The medical officials had yesterday [13 Jan 2015] said most of the patients have procured the vaccine privately, but it still is not known whether all the remaining 252 patients received the vaccine.

Another cause of concern is the potency of the vaccine procured privately, as it has been claimed that failure to maintain cold-chain will render the vaccine impotent.

It may be noted that the Medical Superintendent of district hospital Churachandpur had yesterday [13 Jan 2015] declared that the cases are clinically rabies and would surely be positive if they are tested.

Nevertheless, the Veterinary Department is still struggling to obtain the necessary sample (dog's brain) for confirmation, as all the cases reported so far are done so after the dog concerned has been disposed of. Official sources said that to test for the presence of rabies, it will be necessary for dog owners to chain the dog and put it under observation to see whether it dies within a couple of weeks, but people seem unaware or unwilling to wait for that and instead kill the dog immediately after it bites someone.

[This report is somewhat confusing. Is the number of human rabies cases 11 or 263, or does the latter refer just to humans believed to have been bitten by a "rabid" dog? Another confusion is whether any protection is provided by privately purchased vaccine, or even whether the latter has been subjected to quality testing and/or controls.

However one looks at the situation in Churachandpur, it is patently clear that rabies both of dogs and humans is of significant public health concern, and there is urgent need for an effective canine rabies control and eradication programme. - Mod.MHJ]
