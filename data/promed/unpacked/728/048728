Russian media reports (computer translated) 87 children were hospitalized in the Krasnodar Territory hospitals, who became ill on the Murmansk-Adler train. "87 children who were affected on the Murmansk-Adler train are being treated in the hospitals of the Kuban. As of [8 Aug 2021], there are 67 minors in Tuapse CRH no. 1 with intestinal infection, in Apsheronskaya 12, in Belorechenskaya 8. Doctors assess the condition of children as mild and moderate." An employee of the restaurant car, where the children ate before the illnesses, was suspended from work.

Noroviruses, together with rotaviruses, are the main cause of intestinal infections in children. Noroviruses are very contagious, so the entry of this virus into the children's collective very often leads to the rapid spread of intestinal infection among children.

The 1st symptoms of the disease appear 24-48 hours after infection. It can be a single, but more often multiple vomiting, diarrhea, severe nausea, fever. Norovirus most commonly causes diarrhea and severe vomiting, but sometimes only vomiting can occur. Digestive system disorders can be accompanied by muscle aches, headaches, and weakness.

Usually, the symptoms of norovirus infection resolve on their own within 12-72 hours. After illness, the body develops immunity to the virus, but for a very short period, about 8 weeks. After this period, a person can become infected with norovirus again and get sick.

[According to https://thenewsglory.com/16-children-from-the-murmansk-adler-train-revealed-an-increased-temperature/, a total of 118 children traveled from Murmansk to Tuapse, and they went to rest in the Yubileiny health camp. The train trip should take a little more than 3 days, traveling almost 3500 km (almost 2200 miles), so there was certainly adequate time for infection to spread and cause symptoms, with secondary cases possible as well. With at least 87 children affected, an attack rate of 74% can be calculated. It is not stated if others besides the children were affected and how the diagnosis of norovirus was made.

The 1st sign of norovirus is usually a sudden sick feeling, followed by forceful vomiting and watery diarrhea. Some people may also have a raised temperature (over 38 C/100.4 F), headaches, stomach cramps, and aching limbs. Symptoms usually appear 1 or 2 days after exposure to infection, but they can start sooner. Most people make a full recovery within a few days. Apart from the risk of dehydration, the illness is not generally dangerous, and there are usually no long-lasting effects from norovirus infection.

Norovirus infections can occur at any time of the year but happen most often during the winter months, hence its old name "winter vomiting disease." Norovirus activity can also be localized with increased activity in one area but not in others. Certainly, prominent focal summer activity has been reported in the past with this reference by Guadagnucci Morillo et al (1) as an example. Given the kind of isolation that has occurred related to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, winter-time infections with viruses such as norovirus and respiratory syncytial virus seem to be making their mark in the summer, as personal isolation procedures have been, at least temporarily, lifted.
