Over 100 Reang refugees die in Tripura camps
-------------------------------------------------------
AGARTALA: More than a hundred Reang refugees have succumbed to
gastroenteritis in different camps in north Tripura since the last
fortnight, official sources today said. North Tripura additional district
magistrate, P. Talukdar told PTI that the disease broke out suddenly in the
camps at Kanchanpur and its adjoining areas following a water crisis,
forcing the people to fetch it from nearby streams. State health minister,
Keshab Majumder said here that more than one thousand affected refugees had
been provided medical treatment and the government had taken steps to check
further outbreak of the disease.
"A head count is very difficult as everyday there is a rush for admission
and everyday people die", Talukdar said. Medical camps have been set up
near Dasda, Anandabazar, Kasirampur and adjacent areas in Kanchanpur and
measures taken to supply adequate medicines, food and commodities. The
administration has started supplying fresh drinking water in tankers.
Besides, directives have been given to dig mark-2 tubewells in different
parts of Kanchanpur, the minister said, adding awareness campaigns have
been started to educate people against using polluted water. Majumder said
a fax message was sent to the Centre yesterday with a request to release
adequate funds to meet the situation, reports PTI.
