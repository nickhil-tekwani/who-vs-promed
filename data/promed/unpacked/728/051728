Notifying infectious animal diseases to the OIE
-----------------------------------------------
The OIE (Office International des Epizooties, World Organisation for Animal
Health, headquartered in Paris, France) is an intergovernmental organisation
created by an International Agreement in 1924. In May 2004, the OIE totaled 167
member Countries. (List of Member Countries:
<http://www.oie.int/eng/OIE/PM/en_PM.htm>).
One of the main missions of the OIE is provide information on the
world animal health situation in all transparency.
In order to fulfill its mandate in this respect, the OIE manages the
world animal health information system, based on the commitment of
Member Countries to notify the OIE the occurrence of main animal
diseases, including zoonoses. In May 2004, OIE member countries
approved the creation of a single list of notifiable terrestrial
animal diseases; previously, diseases notifiable to the OIE were
classified into 2 lists, List A and List B, the former being of
higher priority. It was agreed that the change will necessitate
defining acceptable criteria for the inclusion of a disease in the
OIE single list, as well as criteria for the degree of 'urgency' of
each reporting.
OIE's Director General, while announcing the decision (see
20040516.1319), reiterated that the implementation of the changes
will mean completely redesigning the existing animal health
information system, which will need to take full advantage of all the
possibilities offered by the latest information and communication
technology, including mapping software. He convened an Ad hoc Group
on Terrestrial Animal Disease/Pathogenic Agent Notification,
comprised of international experts, to support the OIE Animal Health
Information Department in defining criteria to determine whether a
given disease should be included in the OIE list.
The Ad hoc Group's report*, including the proposed revised single
list and explanatory notes pertaining to each disease -- retained,
added or deleted -- were discussed by the OIE Terrestrial Animal
Health Standards Commission in January 2005 and forwarded to the
General Session of the Member Countries (the International
Committee), by which it was finally approved in May 2005.
The new system prescribes 4 main reporting modes: immediate
notification, follow-up report, 6-monthly report and annual report.
Their performance is prescribed according to the following modalities:
1. An immediate notification, to warn and alert the international
community of exceptional epidemiological events in Member Countries.
In order to improve the scope and the efficiency of the OIE Early
Warning System, the events of epidemiological significance that
should be covered in the immediate notification have been redefined
and are the following:
a. the first occurrence of an OIE-listed disease or infection in a
country or zone/compartment;
b. the re-occurrence of a listed disease or infection in a country or
zone/compartment following a report by the Delegate of the Member
Country declaring the previous outbreak(s) eradicated;
c. the 1st occurrence of a new strain of a pathogen of a listed
disease in a country or zone/compartment thereof;
d. a sudden and unexpected increase in morbidity or mortality caused
by an existing listed disease;
e. an emerging disease with significant morbidity/mortality or
zoonotic potential;
f. evidence of change in the epidemiology of a listed disease (e.g.
host range, pathogenicity, strain of causative pathogen), in
particular if there is a zoonotic impact.
This alert system is aimed at the Veterinary Services of Member
Countries, enabling them to take any necessary protective measures as
quickly as possible to prevent the introduction of pathogens
originating from infected countries.
2. Follow-up report on a weekly basis, subsequent to a notification
under point 1 above, to provide further information on the evolution
of an incident which justified an immediate notification; the
follow-up reports should continue until the situation has been
resolved through either the disease being eradicated or it becoming
endemic so that 6-monthly reporting under point 3 will satisfy the
obligation of the country to the OIE. In any case, a final report on
the incident should be submitted.
3. A 6-monthly report on the evolution, absence or presence of all
the diseases listed by the OIE and information of epidemiological
significance to other countries. (Previously, monthly reports,
relating to List A diseases only -- either present or absent in the
country -- were required; this is not the case anymore).
4. An annual questionnaire concerning any other information of
significance to other countries.
More details on these procedures and the relevant obligations of the
OIE Member Countries are to be found in Chapter 1.1.2 of the
Terrestrial Animal Health Code:
<http://www.oie.int/eng/normes/mcode/en_chapitre_1.1.2.htm>.
Maintaining a disease -- previously included in list A or B -- in the
new single list, deleting it or adding a new disease to the list,
have been decided upon according to a decision-making model which was
based upon 4 basic criteria:
a. International spread;
b. Significant spread within naive populations;
c. Zoonotic potential;
d. Emerging diseases.
Each disease was first evaluated in terms of its potential for
international spread; a disease passing this test had to show
zoonotic potential with severe consequences or a high impact at
country or zonal level, in order to be included. Emerging diseases
had to show zoonotic potential in order to be added. The
decision-making model and the decision tree applied are laid-out in
Article 2.1.1. of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code
<http://www.oie.int/eng/normes/mcode/en_chapitre_2.1.1.htm>.
Following a revision, in line with the said criteria, of the existing
lists A and B and an assessment of several emerging diseases which
have been proposed by OIE Member Countries, the Ad hoc Group
recommended to delete some diseases from the list, add several
emerging diseases, change the names of some and change the species
category of others (for details, see the report*).
The single list, as finally approved by the International Committee,
is included in Article 2.1.1.3. of the Code, as follows:
