Vesicular stomatitis (VS) confirmed in Texas cattle
---------------------------------------------------
This year's outbreak of vesicular stomatitis (VS) now has been confirmed,
not only in horses in Texas and New Mexico, but also in 2 head of cattle in
Starr County, about 225 miles south of San Antonio. The Texas Animal Health
Commission (TAHC), the state's livestock and poultry health regulatory
agency, received notification of the positive laboratory results late on
Tuesday 29 Jun.
The 2 infected cattle are on separate quarantined premises in Starr County
and are the first confirmed cases in cattle in the US since the l997 VS
outbreak, which affected New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona, and Utah. "The l998
outbreak involved only horses," said Dr Max Coats, deputy director for the
TAHC's Animal Health Programs.
"On one of the premises in Starr County, one cow among a handful of cattle
tested positive for VS, and no other susceptible animals are on the site.
On the second premises, the owner has an infected cow and horse, and there
are about 30 other head of cattle and several horses that, at this point,
have no clinical signs of VS and they have tested negative for the
disease," he said.
As of 30 Jun 2004, VS infection in 2004 has been detected on a total of 15
premises in Texas and New Mexico. Disease investigations also are
continuing. With the exception of 2 sites in Starr County, all cases
involve horses.
Texas:
Uvalde County -- 1 premises
Starr County -- 5 premises (2 include infected cattle)
Dimmit County -- 1 premises
Yoakum County -- 1 premises
Val Verde County -- 1 premises
Reeves County -- 1 premises
New Mexico:
Carlsbad area -- 4 premises
Belen, Valencia County -- 1 premises
VS, a viral infection, occurs sporadically in the south western US and is
thought to be transmitted by sand flies and black flies. This painful --
but short-term -- disease can cause blistering and erosions in and around
the mouth, and around the muzzle, teats or hooves of horses, cattle, goats,
swine, deer, and some other livestock. Infected animals with open sores can
expose herd mates to the disease through close contact or by the sharing of
feed buckets or bits. As a precaution, all infected and susceptible
livestock on a premise are quarantined until at least 30 days after all
infected animals have healed.
"The signs of VS mimic those of foot and mouth disease, a dangerous and
highly contagious foreign animal disease that can strike cattle, swine,
sheep, deer and other cloven-hooved animals, but not affect horses," Coats
said. "When livestock develop blistering or erosions, it is imperative that
the animals be evaluated and laboratory tests be conducted to differentiate
between the 2 diseases or to determine whether there is a caustic
substance, toxic weed or poison that is causing the irritation."
A regulatory veterinarian from the TAHC or US Department of Agriculture
should be notified by the owner or private veterinary practitioner, so
small snippets of tissue can be collected from the sores for laboratory
submission. Samples from horses are tested at the National Veterinary
Services Laboratory (NVSL) at Ames, Iowa. As a safety measure, samples from
cloven-hooved animals are shipped to Foreign Animal Disease Laboratory
(FADDL) on Plum Island, New York, where they are subjected to testing for
both vesicular stomatitis and foot and mouth disease.
To report potential signs of VS, owners and practitioners in Texas can call
the TAHC at 1-800-550-8242, anytime, day or night. In New Mexico, reports
should be made to the New Mexico Livestock Board at 1-505-841-6161. The
TAHC urges livestock transporters to check with their intended state of
destination to obtain the latest information on testing requirements,
movement restrictions or other VS-related regulations.
