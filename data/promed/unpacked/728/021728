Ferrets with severe dehydration and diarrhea might be suffering from
a possible new strain of epizootic catarrhal enteritis
------------------------------------------------------
In mid-December [2008], Dr Ruth Heller of the Borderbrook Animal
Hospital in Murraysville, [Pennsylvania] posted to the Ferret Health
List on the Internet a report on a mysterious new illness in ferrets
that might possibly be a new strain of epizootic catarrhal enteritis
(ECE). Heller is also a ferret breeder. She reported that many of her
ferrets recently became ill and 11 have died. Since her posting, some
other ferret owners now say they believe their ferrets also suffered
from this mysterious ailment and some ferrets have died. Reports on
this illness are anecdotal and vary, some going as far back as this
summer [2008].

Right now, it's not known what the disease is or how it is spread.
With reports from Heller and others, the hope is to get these
questions answered so ferret owners and veterinarians know what to
look for in pet ferrets and how to possibly prevent this illness.

Signs and treatment
-------------------
According to Heller, the signs of this illness include extreme
dehydration. "The hallmark of this disease is the immense
dehydration. These ferrets are like chunks of wood, they are so dry,"
Heller said.

Heller stated that other signs seen in her group of ferrets are:

1. Going from a "happy, healthy, bouncy ferret to cold/flat/extremely
dehydrated ferret with or without bloody diarrhea in the span of less
than 8 hours."
2. Extreme difficulty rehydrating. Heller said that some of the
ferrets she's treating require 200 or more cc of fluids per day.
3. Appetite is variable -- some ferrets eat on their own, others don't.
4. Diarrhea is copious, liquid, and progresses to bloody.
5. No vomiting was noted.
6. The diarrhea is not green, as is usual with normal cases of ECE.
7. Death can be as rapid as 8 hours after 1st onset of clinical signs.
8. Some ferrets experienced a bit of diarrhea, but have not shown the
other signs and have recovered uneventfully.

Heller contacted a couple of veterinary pathologists about this, and
their best guess is that this is a mutated strain of ECE, but this is
not confirmed. Test results are pending to confirm if this is indeed
the case.

Tests already completed have ruled out bacterial infection and
Coccidia. Heller also reported the following on other test results.
"We do know that it is not:
o _Helicobacter_ infection, no evidence of _Helicobacter_ was found in
the tissue when histopathology was done; or
o Aleutian disease, nothing typical of that, and my household is
tested every 6 months since we show and breed; fecal cultures were
negative; fecal analysis was negative; bloodwork [showed] anemia, low
platelets, non-clotting
blood in later stages, elevation of kidney values, moderately low
blood sugar, normal to slightly low albumin, normal liver values."

"Post-mortem exams on these ferrets don't show all that much other
than gastrointestinal inflammation and some ulceration," Heller said.

Several severely affected ferrets have been treated successfully by
Heller. Her treatment involves aggressive fluid therapy, IV if
possible, or lots of subcutaneous fluids, together with the
medications she lists here. "Carafate every 2 to 3 hours; an
antibiotic -- amoxycillin, clavamox, baytril, clindamycin are all ones
we've tried; possibly metronidazole, although it doesn't seem to make
a big difference in the ones it's been used in so far; omeprazole;
and Tamiflu." Heller said she hasn't lost any ferrets since starting
Tamiflu and recommends any household where this illness appears to
put all ferrets in the household on Tamiflu.

Concerns for ferret owners
--------------------------
What does all this mean to ferret owners? If your ferret develops
diarrhea, should you rush it to the veterinarian? Heller said no, not
unless the ferret has diarrhea for more than a day. She believes
owners won't confuse a bout of the flu with this illness because the
signs of this illness are so severe. "Their entire appearance
changes, and they are flat/depressed and cold." Heller said. "We had
one with a temperature of 92 [deg F / 33.3 deg C] when we found him;
he had been completely normal less than 8 hours previously. The
diarrhea is massive, and usually bloody, although not always."

Although the cause of this illness and its method of spreading aren't
yet known, Heller recommends that ferret owners stay away from other
ferrets. If owners do come in contact with other ferrets, she said
they should change clothes and shower before touching their own
ferrets.

If a ferret does seem to have this illness, Heller wants people to be
sure to have their vet consider ECE, even if the ferret isn't
suffering green diarrhea. However, she warned that people shouldn't
automatically jump to the conclusion that this mystery disease is the
culprit. "There are lots of other diseases out there to watch for.
Sometimes the new disease becomes so much the focus of attention that
what's really going on gets missed."

Is there a pattern?
-------------------
Barb Clay of Rocky's Ferret Rescue And Shelter in Maryland hasn't had
any ferrets fall ill, but she's on an Internet forum that's
discussing this situation. She sent a post to The Ferret Mailing List
about a website created by Stephanie Richmond to track confirmed and
suspected cases of this illness. "By illustrating where the outbreaks
are," Clay said, "we can be more vigilant with our personal and
professional practices and work toward containing this bug and
minimizing further outbreaks." [See comment below].

[Purdue Universities Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory summarizes
in a Summer 2008 newsletter the causes of gastroenteritis in the
ferret as follows: "Gastroenteritis is a common clinical finding in
ferrets. While most cases of gastroenteritis are due to foreign
bodies, specific disease entities, such as eosinophilic
gastro-enteritis, _Helicobacter mustelae_- associated gastritis, and
epizootic catarrhal enteritis may be involved." However, none of
these syndromes appear to explain the high mortality, acute disease
alluded to in this article. For further details on each of these
diseases see
<http://www.addl.purdue.edu/newsletters/2008/Summer/gastro.htm>.

From time to time, high mortality diseases affecting the
gastrointestinal track do appear in companion animal populations, the
most notorious of these was the parvovirus epidemic that swept across
the world in 1978 and 1979.

At the very end of this article a website that identifies reported
occurrences is cited
(<http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF&msa=0&msid=117678708651626846782.00045e853ac0ba00bed11>).
It should be interesting to see how much data is added to the website
and also to track any further outbreaks.

ProMED-mail would appreciate hearing from anyone who knows
information, which can elucidate the cause or epidemiology of this
outbreak in ferrets. - Mod.PC]
