[The disease was 1st detected in Shimoga district, Karnataka state, in 1957 and has since appeared sporadically in the thickly wooded areas of Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, Chikmagalur, Shimoga, and Chamarajanagar (all in Karnataka state). The disease occurs in humans and monkeys, and the virus is transmitted by ticks with _Haemaphysalis spinigera_ as the major vector. Most human cases occur during the dry season. Additional information is available from the CDC fact sheet (see: http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/Fact_Sheets/KyasanurForestDis.pdf).

ProMED-mail thanks Dr Gudadappa Kasabi for submitting this 1st hand report from Karnataka state.
