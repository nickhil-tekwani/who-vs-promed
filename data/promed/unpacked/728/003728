LEGIONNAIRE'S DISEASE EPIDEMIOLOGY (3)
======================================
[Replying to the request for more information on these cases:]
I apologize for the shortage of information. I'm working from what is
largely anecdotal information from a friend of mine. I should add that
case A was mentally retarded and was being treated for a seizure
disorder with phenobarbital (20 mg. bid). Case B was an epileptic
being treated with tegratol, had been diagnosed with Burkitt's
lymphoma about 6 years ago, and had a portion of his colon removed
in the past.
Both cases had WBC of 13 at time of admission and I am unaware of any
attempts to culture any organisms from case B though I do know that case A
was negative for RSV.
Cases occurred about three months apart, were unrelated and lived in
separate communities.
