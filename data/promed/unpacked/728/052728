Quirch Foods Co. of Miami, Florida is voluntary recalling a lot of
Cap-Pele Herring Export, Inc brand, Salted Smoked Split Herring, Plant
Reg No. 4108-2931, Processor: Petite Cap Fisheries Ltd. 2015 Route
950, Petite-Cap, NB, E4N 2H5, Canada. A sample collected by FDA at a
Florida Distributor was found to be uneviscerated. _Clostridium
botulinum_ spores are more likely to be concentrated in the viscera
than any other portion of the fish.

The product was distributed in 18 lb, 8.2 kg, bulk packed wooden
boxes, with a "REG No 4108-2931" stamp. The product was sold to
supermarkets and a distributor in Florida, and St. Thomas VI and is
packaged at retail per customer request.

No illnesses have been reported to date.

Consumers are cautioned not to consume this product, even if it does
not look or smell spoiled. The product should immediately be returned
to the store where it was purchased.

[This recall is related to the same Canadian processor and same type
of product as had been previously reported 5 weeks ago (Botulism,
uneviscerated fish - USA: risk, recall, ex Canada 20111014.3078). It
is not clear that the current recall is from the same group as then.

Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such
recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated
with the food products.

Most of the food recalls (as in these cases) are related to defective
preparation procedures, which could, but not necessarily do, result in
the germination of viable spores of _C. botulinum_. - Mod.LL]
