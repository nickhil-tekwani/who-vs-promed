The Wyoming Game and Fish Department has destroyed about 1200
pheasants at its Downar Bird Farm near Torrington in southeastern
Wyoming after discovering a disease in the birds that can infect
humans.

The department said Friday [20 May 2011] that workers have found some
birds with cecal worms, which are not uncommon. This week, the Wyoming
State Veterinary Laboratory confirmed an agent in some birds that can
cause psittacosis. The disease can cause fever and other flu-like
symptoms in humans, though none of the workers at the bird farm has
exhibited signs of the illness. Fewer than 50 human cases are reported
in the US each year, and no human cases of the disease have been
reported in Wyoming since 2000. Game and Fish Wildlife chief Brian
Nesvik says it's unclear if the disease will affect this fall's [2011]
pheasant releases.

[This article is a bit short on details. Cecal worms are not uncommon
in birds and would seem a poor reason to destroy this many.

The article is vague in saying, "Laboratory confirmed an agent in
some birds that can cause psittacosis." That statement seems to
indicate that a chlamydial bacterium has been cultured. _Chlamydia_ is
the cause of psittacosis. While psittacosis is a zoonotic disease,
this article is not even firm about how many birds had the bacteria.

We hope Wyoming will be forthcoming with a bit more evidence and
reason for why the birds were destroyed. Was it psittacosis?

Psittacosis is an infectious disease of birds and people. The
causative agent is _Chlamydophila psittaci_. The agent was previously
known as _Chlamydia psittaci_. Psittacosis is known by other names
such as parrot fever, when the disease in parrots, but it is known as
ornithosis when the disease is in some other birds, such as turkeys.

Birds can be healthy carriers. That is, the birds may appear healthy
but still be shedding the organism that may infect other birds or
people. Carriers show no signs of their illness but are capable of
infecting others. Clinical signs in birds include respiratory
problems, greenish diarrhea, and a loss of appetite and weight.
Generally they have ruffled feathers and conjunctivitis.

Sick birds can be treated and managed but they do require prompt
treatment. - Mod.TG]
