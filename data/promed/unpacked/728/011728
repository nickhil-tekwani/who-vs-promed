[According to Twitter chatter, Al Jawf (Al Jouf) is the location of a Camel and Range Research Centre. Checking the Internet, it appears as though the Al Jouf Camel and Range Research Centre has been publishing in the Scientific Literature on camel nutrition and a focus on camel milk and camel milk products. It is intriguing that the Saudi case report from 6 Jun 2014 has 4 asymptomatic MERS-CoV positive infections in Al Jawf (Al Jouf), all expats (non-Saudi citizens), one of whom is a healthcare worker. Clearly these positive infections were found through screening as all were asymptomatic infections. One of the questions is why these individuals were screened? Were they screened because of contact with a MERS-CoV infected individual? Or were they screened because of working in a camel research center. More information on these individuals might shed some additional light on possible routes of transmission of the MERS-CoV.

[4] UAE risk assessment - WHO 6 Jun 2014
Date: Fri 6 Jun 2014

http://www.who.int/features/2014/mers-cov-risk-assessment/en/


WHO concludes a MERS-CoV risk assessment mission in the United Arab Emirates [UAE]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A team from the WHO and technical partners from the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) has concluded a 5 day mission in United Arab Emirates (UAE).

The team assessed the risk posed by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, or MERS-CoV in the country. The team consisted of 6 experts in coordination, epidemiology, infection prevention and control, food safety and the human-animal interface, and risk communication.

Health authorities in the UAE had invited WHO to review the current situation after an upsurge in MERS-CoV infections in April [2014]. Upon arrival, the WHO team met with H.E Mr Abdul Rahman bin Mohammed Al Owais, the Minister of Health, in Dubai to discuss the mission.

Investigation and evaluation
----------------------------
During the mission, the team had extensive meetings with experts from Health Authority Abu Dhabi, Dubai Health Authority and the Abu Dhabi Food Control Authority. The team visited the hospital to which two-thirds of the country's cases can be traced, in order to review the epidemiological investigation and assess the infection prevention and control measures that have been applied. The WHO team evaluated the work done on investigating possible exposure routes, transmission patterns, and the clinical situation.

"We are impressed by the amount of data and information generated during the investigation of MERS cases by UAE to help better understand MERS-CoV. This knowledge is of utmost importance to the rest of the world to better discover the source of the virus and the routes of transmissions from animals to humans," said Peter Ben Embarek, WHO team leader.

"The UAE health authorities have been following up diligently on the MERS-CoV cases, including repeated laboratory testing to check when cases have been cleared of the virus. This data will make an important contribution to the risk assessment and to guide the health response internationally," Ben Embarek concluded.

Need to share experience and knowledge
------------------------------------
The preliminary result of the mission indicates that the cases in UAE do not show evidence of sustained human-to-human infection. The recent upsurge of cases in Abu Dhabi appears to have been caused by a combination of factors, including a breach in infection prevention and control measures in health care settings, active surveillance, and increase in community acquired cases.

WHO recommends that the UAE health authorities to continue to investigate MERS, including the source of infection, and share new information as it becomes available. There is an ongoing need to share experiences and knowledge from all countries that have cases of MERS-CoV to better understand this emerging disease, including the role of animals in the spread of the MERS-CoV.

WHO stressed the importance of participating in multi-country case control studies from both the human health and animal health perspective. There are opportunities to do joint analysis of samples from infected camels and the infected humans around them. These studies will help understand the role of camels in the disease -- particularly how human infection happens. This information will help inform people who are in close contact with camels to gain a realistic picture of the risk, and the level of precaution needed.

Globally, as of [4 Jun 2014], 681 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV have officially been reported to WHO, including 204 deaths [case fatality rate 30 percent].

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall

[The finding of breaches in infection control procedures is not surprising, as this is generally the case when there are nosocomial outbreaks of infectious diseases. This was observed in the nosocomial outbreaks seen in Saudi Arabia, and during the SARS outbreak(s) in various countries in 2003.

According to the most recent ECDC Epidemiologic Update on MERS-CoV, as of 4 Jun 2014, there have been 70 cases of MERS-CoV infection, including 9 deaths (case fatality rate 12.9 percent) reported by the UAE (see http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/press/news/_layouts/forms/News_DispForm.aspx?List=8db7286c-fe2d-476c-9133-18ff4cb1b568&ID=1016).

[5] WHO travel advice on MERS-CoV for pilgrimages
Date: Tue 3 Jun 2014
Source: WHO International travel and health [edited]

World Health Organization travel advice on MERS-CoV for pilgrimages
-------------------------------------------------------------------
I. Introduction
As of May 2014, more than 635 cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have been reported to WHO.

The virus appears to be circulating widely throughout the Arabian Peninsula and most MERS cases have been reported by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. While most cases have occurred among residents, some cases have occurred among visitors. Based on currently available information, the overall risk for visitors to acquire MERS infection appears to be low.

The currently known epidemiological patterns indicate some infections occur in communities. Cases detected in the community may arise from contact with infected animals or unprocessed products from infected animals, from person-to-person spread in the community, or from acquisition in the healthcare setting by individuals who remained living in the community. Studies are underway to determine the relative contribution of all of these, but the studies are not yet complete. Other infections have occurred in hospitals, primarily when hospitalization of an infected patient, coupled with suboptimal infection control and prevention practices, has led to hospital transmission and outbreaks. Finally, infection among families has been seen and may reflect either person-to-person transmission or possibly exposure to a common source. At this time, the understanding of how MERS is transmitted is not complete, and we await the results of the studies in progress. There is no information at this time to suggest that widespread transmission is occurring in communities.

Since April 2014, there was an increased number of cases, notably in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and in the United Arab Emirates in both communities and health care setting. The latest information on MERS-CoV can be found at http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/en/.

II. Effective communication of risk information
It is important for countries to use all practical and effective means possible to communicate information on a range of issues before, during and after Umra and Hajj to all key groups, including the following:
- travellers to Umra and Hajj, particularly vulnerable groups within this population;
- public health officials;
- health care staff responsible for the care of ill pilgrims;
- transportation and tourism industries; and
- the general public.

2.1. Actions for countries to take in preparation for Umra and Hajj
- Countries should advise travellers that persons with pre-existing major medical conditions (for example, chronic diseases such as diabetes, chronic lung disease, immunodeficiency) are more likely to develop severe infection for MERS if they are exposed to the virus. Pilgrims should be advised to consult a health care provider before travelling to review the risk and assess whether making the pilgrimage is advisable.
- Countries should advise travellers and travel organizations on general travel health precautions (see International Travel and Health http://www.who.int/ith/en/index.html), which will lower the risk of infection in general, including influenza and traveller's diarrhoea. Specific emphasis should be placed on:
-- hand hygiene (see World Health Organization., WHO Patient Safety. WHO guidelines on hand hygiene in health care. Geneva, World Health Organization, 2009 http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2009/9789241597906_eng.pdf) and respiratory hygiene (covering mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, washing hands after contact with respiratory secretions, and keeping a distance of one metre with other persons when having acute febrile respiratory symptoms);
-- adhering to good food-safety practices, such as avoiding undercooked meat or food prepared under unsanitary conditions, and properly washing fruits and vegetables before eating them; and
-- maintaining good personal hygiene.
- Countries should make health related advice available to all travellers departing for Umra or Hajj by working with the travel and tourism sectors and placing such materials at strategic locations (such as travel agent offices or points of departure in airports). Different kinds of communication, such as health alerts on board of planes and ships, and banners, pamphlets, and radio announcements at international points of entry, can also be used to reach travellers. Travel advice should include current information on MERS-CoV and guidance on how to avoid illness while travelling.
- Countries should distribute current WHO guidelines, or their national equivalents, on surveillance (see Interim surveillance recommendations for human infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus at http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/InterimRevisedSurveillanceRecommendations_nCoVinfection_27Jun13.pdf), infection prevention, and control measures (see Infection prevention and control of epidemic-and pandemic prone acute respiratory infections in health care. WHO guidelines (2014) http://www.who.int/csr/bioriskreduction/infection_control/publication/en/), and clinical management (see Interim guidance for clinical management of severe acute respiratory infections when novel coronavirus is suspected: What to do and what not to do http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/InterimGuidance_ClinicalManagement_NovelCoronavirus_11Feb13u.pdf) of MERS-CoV to health care practitioners and health care facilities.
- Countries should ensure that they have access to adequate laboratory services for testing for MERS-CoV and that information on how to obtain laboratory services and clinical referral is known to health care providers and facilities.
- Countries should advise travellers to delay their travel if they develop a significant acute respiratory illness with fever and cough;
- countries should provide medical staff accompanying pilgrims with up to date information and guidance on MERS-CoV, ensuring that:
-- they are alert to the early signs of a developing respiratory infection and pneumonia;
-- they know who is considered to be in a high-risk group;
-- they know what to do when a suspected case is identified;
-- they are aware of simple health measures to reduce transmission.

2.2. Actions to take during Umra or Hajj
- Countries should advise travellers that if they develop a significant acute respiratory illness with fever and cough (severe enough to interfere with usual daily activities) during Umra or Hajj, they should:
-- report to the medical staff accompanying the group or to the local health services;
-- cover their mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, wash hands afterwards, or if this is not possible, cough or sneeze into upper sleeves of their clothing;
-- avoid attending crowded places and preferably isolate themselves until the end of the respiratory symptoms and, if isolation is not possible, use a tissue for covering nose and mouth or a surgical mask when in crowded places (See rapid advice note on home care for patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection presenting with mild symptoms and management of contacts at http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/MERS_home_care.pdf?ua=1).
- Countries should advise travellers to avoid close contact with camels, visit farms and consume unpasteurized camel milk, urine or improperly cooked meat.

2.3. Actions to take after Umra or Hajj
- Countries should advise returning travellers that if they develop a significant acute respiratory illness with fever and cough (severe enough to interfere with usual daily activities) during the two weeks after their return, they should:
-- seek medical attention, informing health attendants of their recent travel for Umra or Hajj;
-- immediately notify their local health authority;
-- take precautions when coughing or sneezing (see 2.2. above);
-- minimize their contact with others to keep from infecting them.
- Countries should alert health practitioners and facilities to test returning travellers with a clinical presentation that suggests the diagnosis of MERS-CoV to be tested for MERS-CoV and to implement infection prevention and control measures. Confirmed cases of MERS-CoV must be reported to WHO. Clinicians should also be alerted to the possibility of atypical presentations in patients who are immunocompromised.

III. Measures at borders and for conveyances
- WHO does not recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions or entry screening.
- WHO encourages countries to provide information on MERS and this travel advice to transport operators and ground staff, and about self-reporting of illness by travellers.
- As provided by the IHR, countries should ensure that;
-- routine measures are in place at point of entry for assessing ill travellers detected on board conveyances (such as planes and ships) and at entry;
-- procedures and means are in place for communicating information on ill travellers between conveyance and points of entry as well as between points of entry and national health authorities;
-- safe transportation of symptomatic travellers to hospitals or designated facilities for clinical assessment and treatment is organized.
- If a sick traveller is on board a plane, a passenger locator form (See a model passenger locator form at http://www.who.int/ihr/ports_airports/locator_card/en/index.html) can be used. This form is useful for collecting contact information for passengers, which can be used for follow-up if necessary.

[As of today, 7 Jun 2014, there have been a total of 698 cases of MERS-CoV infection confirmed in Saudi Arabia, including 285 deaths, with a case fatality rate of 40.8 percent. A reminder here is that on 3 Jun 2014, the Saudi MOH reported a revised total of the number of cases of MERS-CoV infections and deaths following a review of all reports, with a resultant increase of 113 new cases including 92 deaths newly attributed to MERS-CoV infections (see MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (76): Saudi Arabia, Jordan, UAE, ECDC assessment, WHO 20140604.2515846 for more details). Hence, once all of the newly reported cases by Saudi Arabia are added to the existing WHO tally, the global number of MERS-CoV infected individuals will surpass 800 cases. According to the 4 Jun 2014 ECDC epidemiologic update on MERS-CoV, the global tally of MERS-CoV infected individuals is now 815, including 313 deaths (case fatality rate 38.4 percent).

There is an excellent table showing the distribution of cases and deaths by country and date of onset of most recent case at http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/press/news/_layouts/forms/News_DispForm.aspx?List=8db7286c-fe2d-476c-9133-18ff4cb1b568&ID=1016.

The WHO update on travel advice on MERS-CoV for pilgrimages, issued 3 Jun 2014 (see section [5] above) serves as a compendium of recommendations that have been issued over the months as more and more information on MERS-CoV has become available. While the recommendation for self exclusion of individuals identified as high risk of severe disease with MERS-CoV infection is clearly stated here (as well as in the guidance for pilgrims issued by the Saudi MOH in 2013 (see http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/hajj/pages/healthregulations.aspx section "MERS-CoV Precautions), the realities are that individuals do not always heed advice to self exclude, and are willing to risk possible severe illness to make the pilgrimage as part of their religious observance. According to the Saudi Embassy website, "The pilgrimage is the religious high point of a Muslim's life and an event that every Muslim dreams of undertaking." The Embassy website also states, "Performing these rituals, known as the Hajj, is the 5th pillar of Islam and the most significant manifestation of Islamic faith and unity. Undertaking the Hajj at least once is a duty for Muslims who are physically and financially able to make the journey to Makkah. The emphasis on financial ability is meant to ensure that a Muslim takes care of his family first. The requirement that a Muslim be healthy and physically capable of undertaking the pilgrimage is intended to exempt those who cannot endure the rigors of extended travel." (See http://www.saudiembassy.net/issues/hajj/). The challenge for the public health community will be to effectively communicate the messages that will lead to self exclusion of high risk individuals.

Until there is a full understanding of high risk exposures that lead to MERS-CoV infection, which will permit more specific recommendations on how to avoid MERS-CoV infection through behavior modification (and situation avoidance), it appears as though at present the best advice is for known high risk individuals to avoid travelling to Saudi Arabia for pilgrimage to avoid potential exposure to the MERS-CoV. - Mod.MPP]
