APHIS' Emergency Management Operations Center (EMOC) announced on May 12
that the investigation of RCD in rabbits in Crawford County, Iowa, was
closed. There have been no new cases of RCD [sic: rabbit hemorrhagic
disease, RHD; the etiologic agent of which is rabbit hemorrhagic disease
virus, RHDV - Mod. CHC. An extensive epidemiological investigation
failed to determine how the rabbits were infected.
USDA's Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (FADDL) provided the
following information about the characterization of RCV/USA/Iowa/2000.
RT-PCR products of a 1993 FADDL experimental case of rabbit calicivirus
infection (from field material of Mexico 1989) were sequenced. The Iowa
isolate is significantly different from the virus that caused the outbreak
in Mexico in 1989, and is most similar to the European isolates from the
late 1980s. Additional support for an Italy/Germany origin is the
monoclonal antibody reactivity profile that compares the RCV/USA/Iowa/2000
to strains that occurred in those two European countries in 1996-1997.
This variant is known in Europe as "RHDVa". FADDL thanks ARS colleagues at
Plum Island for their support in sequencing the PCR products of the Mexican
isolate and colleagues of the Brescia lab in Italy for the monoclonal
antibody profiles.
Dr. Kevin Petersburg, area veterinarian in charge (AVIC) for Illinois,
provided a summary of the investigation (see below).

Report from Dr. Kevin Petersburg, Iowa AVIC

On March 27, 2000, a veterinarian from the ISU Diagnostic Laboratory called
the Area office of USDA, APHIS, VS to report that a rabbit that he had
necropsied had liver damage that appeared consistent with Viral Hemorrhagic
Disease of Rabbits, also known as Rabbit Calicivirus Disease (RCD) [sic:
see above.
Veterinary Services personnel picked up the tissues and slides from this
case and sent the samples to the USDA, Foreign Animal Disease Laboratory at
Plum Island, New York.
The Foreign Animal Disease Laboratory and a laboratory in Spain confirmed
that the rabbits were infected with Rabbit Calicivirus Disease. The
rabbits were raised on an acreage in Crawford County, Iowa. The acreage
was quarantined by the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship
by the order of the State Veterinarian. Some of the rabbits were housed in
hutches and some were allowed to run free. The free-roaming rabbits were
fed pellets on the ground in front of the rabbits in hutches. The
free-roaming rabbits were the first to get sick and die. The rabbits in
hutches were affected soon after that. The rabbits tended to show no
clinical signs before the owner found them dead. Twenty-five of
twenty-seven rabbits died from March 9 - March 30. The two remaining
rabbits were euthanised by Veterinary Services personnel and the carcasses
were incinerated at the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames,
IA. The hutches and a building that housed a couple of the hutches were
burned and the ashes were buried under the supervision of the Iowa
Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship.
The acreage remains quarantined until such time as the remaining virus on
the acreage would likely have been inactivated by exposure to the natural
elements. An extensive epidemiological investigation has failed to
determine how the rabbits got infected. The investigation included
questions about any visitors to the acreage who own rabbits (one), any
shows in which the rabbits may have participated (none since August 1999),
any visits to other rabbit sites by the owner or his daughter (none), any
sales of rabbits (a few sold and slaughtered in January), and the source of
feed for the rabbits and the source of hutches and utensils for the
rabbits. All premises within 1 mile of the acreage were visited and no
domestic rabbits were found. Local veterinary clinics were contacted and
none had seen sick rabbits recently. Only one individual who had contact
with the rabbits also raised rabbits, and his rabbits were healthy until
May 2, 2000 when one [of his rabbits died. Tissues from the rabbit were
sent to the Foreign Animal Disease Laboratory at Plum Island, New York; RCD
was ruled out. The persons who buy feed at the same facility as the owner
of the positive premises were contacted; their rabbits are all healthy.
Other businesses that sell rabbit feed also were contacted for a list of
clients. None of the clientele that were contacted had sick rabbits. The
total number of businesses and individuals contacted was approximately 47.
The following contacts were made to notify people that RCD was found in
Iowa: the Office of International Epizootics (OIE), the American Rabbit
Breeders Association, the House Rabbit Society, Kind Planet, the Rabbit
Industry Council, U.S. licensed biologics manufacturers and rabbit
breeders, the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians,
and the American Veterinary Medical Association. State veterinarians and
Area Veterinarians in Charge also were provided with information for
further dissemination within their states. The Iowa Veterinary Medical
Association, the Iowa State University Extension Service, cooperative
extension offices and 4-H officers were provided with information.
Information was also posted on the USDA, APHIS website. No additional
cases of RCD have been reported at this time. Although we continue to
encourage people to report possible new cases of RCD to our office, we are
considering the current investigation closed at this time.

[Fascinating that the investigating authorities are clueless as to where
this virus originated. Not all epidemiologic investigations have happy
ending. Until the other shoe drops, this string is cut. Thanks to all the
folks who sent messages providing both the above information and innovative
hypotheses as to the origin of this outbreak in Iowa. - Mod.CHC
