CHOLERA, DIARRHEA & DYSENTERY UPDATE 2004 (16): CORRECTION

From: Mikio Kimura <kimumiki@nih.go.jp>

We were very surprised with the description in the WHO's Weekly
Epidemiological Report (WER, 9 Jul 2004) that we had, from 27 Jan to 22 Jun
2004, a total of 18 cholera cases, and, that all of them had died.
We have never described such outcomes for our cholera case notifications to
the WHO, and we strongly believe that there have been no fatal cholera
cases in Japan since the beginning of 2004.
The ProMED post further amplifies this issue by saying that all of the 18
cases acquired their infections inside Japan. We have reported the
suspected country of disease acquisition for each case to the WHO, although
that information was not shown on WER. In fact, all of the 18 cases seemed
to have contracted their illness outside Japan.
