The HSE [Health Service Executive] has issued an appeal to parents following an outbreak of scarlet fever at an East Galway creche. Five children in the facility have contracted the fever in recent weeks. The HSE confirmed last evening that "a small number of children in east Galway" have had the rash-type.

The regional health authority said affected children have been treated with antibiotics. It advises parents of children with scarlet fever symptoms to contact their general practitioner for advice.

The news report above indicates that attendance at a child day care center is the epidemiological link among the cases in Galway. Persons who have group A streptococcal sore throat or skin infections are most likely to spread the infection; those who carry the bacteria but have no symptoms are less contagious (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/groupastreptococcal_g.htm).
Genotypic characterization of outbreak isolates by molecular methods such as multilocus sequence typing, ribotyping, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis will aid in identifying common outbreak strains.

Galway is a city on the west coast of Ireland on Galway Bay and is surrounded by County Galway. The county is part of two constituencies: Galway East and Galway West. Galway City is divided into east, west, and central sections. East Galway in the news report above may refer either to the eastern portion of County Galway (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Galway) or Galway City East (http://www.galwaycity.ie/AllServices/YourCouncil/CouncilMembers/GalwayCityEast/). For a map of East and West County Galway and the city of Galway, see http://wikitravel.org/en/File:Galway.jpg. The city of Galway is the third largest city in Ireland (after Dublin and Cork), with a population of 75 529 in 2011 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galway).
