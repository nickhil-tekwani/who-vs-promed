Fusarium found in oats
--------------
Fusarium head blight [FHB], a disease that has ravaged wheat and barley
crops in the Red River valley, has been found at high levels in Manitoba
oats crops.
According to Agriculture Canada plant disease specialist Andy Tekauz, oats
is an important crop in Manitoba, and the disease could become a serious
problem for next year's oats growers. He indicated that the Manitoba oat
breeding program may have to be redirected to address this issue.
FHB-infected wheat and barley seeds can be detected by tearing apart the
plant heads and looking for damaged kernels, but infected kernels are less
visible in oats, perhaps only one in 10 000 being obviously damaged.
FHB can damage an oats crop's germination and emergence rates. A farmer
planting an infected crop probably won't know it's infected and won't
realize that his poor germination and emergence rates are due to FHB.
Tekauz said since farmers can't effectively scout their fields for an
infected crop; they must rely on forecasting models developed by disease
experts. However, experts don't know yet whether some of the treatments
used to control FHB in wheat and barley will work in oats.
Fortunately, FHB-induced toxicity in infected crops fed to livestock is
broken down by the milling process used for human consumption. That means
oats crops grading highly may not be hurt by the surprising prevalence of
the disease. However, oats crops may have to be tested routinely for FHB.
Tekauz said some oats varieties appear to be more resistant to FHB, and
disease specialists will try to identify resistant varieties and pass that
information to farmers.
"There's always a chance that this is a flash in the pan, that 2002
represents a worst-case scenario," said Tekauz. Based on the experience
with wheat and barley, he indicated that pathologists and breeders will
likely have to minimize the FHB problem and live with it.

[According to pathologists at the USDA Cereal Disease Laboratory at St.
Paul, MN, the FHB pathogen, formerly known as _Fusarium graminearum_ Group
2, has been reclassified as _F.graminearum_ (sexual stage, _Gibberella
zeae_) and is distinct from the pathogen that causes crown rot (_F.
pseudograminearum_).
