Rapid increase in lymphogranuloma venereum in men who have sex with men, United Kingdom, 2003 to September 2015
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Authors: Childs T, Simms I, Alexander S, Eastick K, Hughes G, Field N]

United Kingdom (UK) national data show a sharp increase in diagnoses of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) since 2012. Most cases are in men who have sex with men (MSM) living in London [England], with high rates of co-infection with HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. In light of these data, and the recent finding that one quarter of LGV infections may be asymptomatic, clinicians should be vigilant in testing for LGV, including in asymptomatic HIV-positive MSM.

Laboratory diagnoses of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) in the United Kingdom (UK) declined between 2010 and 2012, but the most recent data show near doubling of cases since 2012 to unprecedented levels in 2014 (679 cases). This trend has continued into 2015, with 683 cases diagnosed by 30 Sep [2015]. In 2014, most cases were in men who have sex with men (MSM) and around 3/4ths were HIV-positive. Here we report national surveillance data showing trends in LGV diagnoses in the UK from 2003 to September 2015.

Testing protocol and data sources
---------------------------------
Rectal, genital or urine samples from patients with symptoms compatible with LGV and diagnosed with _Chlamydia trachomatis_ in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and their sexual contacts with _C. trachomatis_, are submitted by local laboratories for LGV typing to the Public Health England national reference laboratory, the Sexually Transmitted Bacteria Reference Unit (STBRU) in London. Scottish samples from symptomatic patients are similarly submitted to the Scottish Bacterial Sexually Transmitted Infections Reference Laboratory (SBSTIRL) in Edinburgh. In addition, since 2007, samples from asymptomatic HIV-positive MSM diagnosed with _C. trachomatis_ are also sent to SBSTIRL. During the reporting period, (January 2003 to September 2015) STBRU and SBSTIRL diagnoses accounted for all confirmed LGV cases diagnosed in the UK. Duplicates were excluded and repeat diagnoses within 42 days (used to define a single episode of care across surveillance systems in England) were counted as a single episode [1].

Additional data, including sexual behaviour and clinical information, were collected through nationally coordinated enhanced surveillance of LGV in the UK between 2004 and 2010 [2]. However, the most recent laboratory dataset lacks this enhanced information. We therefore matched laboratory reports for LGV diagnoses to the Genitourinary Medicine Clinic Activity Dataset (GUMCADv2), an anonymised patient-level electronic dataset, for all cases in England in 2014. All commissioned sexual health services in England have been mandated to return GUMCADv2 data, which include patient characteristics, other sexually transmitted infection (STI) diagnoses and services provided, since 2009 [3]. A code for LGV diagnosis was introduced in 2011, such that most cases are now reported through GUMCADv2. LGV diagnoses in female or heterosexual male patients in GUMCADv2 were excluded from this analysis because they may represent miscoding (6 cases).

Trends in confirmed laboratory reports
--------------------------------------
Between 1 Jan 2003 and 30 Sep 2015, there were 4124 LGV diagnoses in the UK (36 from Scotland since 2011). Of these, 4,111 (99.7 percent) were in men, and 242 had repeat diagnoses. LGV was 1st reported in the UK in 2003 (one case) and in 2004, 28 cases were reported (Figure).

Since 2003, the overall trend in LGV cases has been upward, with 3 rapid increases in 2005 (220 cases), 2010 (510 cases) and 2014 (679 cases), and intervening periods of stable or falling numbers between 2006 and 2009 (136 to 201 cases) and 2011 and 2012 (389 and 376 cases). There has been a sustained increase in diagnoses since 2012, such that diagnoses in 2014 were 81 percent higher than in 2012 (376 cases), and in the 1st quarter of 2015, there were 195 LGV diagnoses compared with 163 diagnoses in the same time period in 2014.

Case characteristics among clinical reports
-------------------------------------------
In 2014, 11 468 diagnoses of _C. trachomatis_ among MSM and 633 LGV cases were reported to GUMCADv2. Of the LGV cases, 434 (69 percent) could be matched to the laboratory dataset. Among the matched MSM cases, the median (IQR) age at LGV diagnosis was 37 (range: 31-44) years, and most were white (320, 74 percent), born in the UK (239, 55 percent) and living in London (323, 74 percent). Most cases were HIV-positive (321, 74 percent) and of these, nearly all were diagnosed with HIV before or at the same time as their LGV diagnosis (313, 98 percent). Many patients were diagnosed with another STI or blood borne virus infection at any time during 2014 (272, 63 percent), including gonorrhoea (219, 50 percent), syphilis (76, 18 percent) and hepatitis C (13, 3 percent) (Table).

Background
----------
LGV is a STI caused by the invasive L serovars of _C. trachomatis_. An outbreak among MSM was 1st reported in the Netherlands in 2003 and LGV outbreaks in MSM have since been reported by many high-income countries, with HIV co-infection being a common feature [4-8]. Most reported infections are rectal, and the most common presentation is proctitis, associated with rectal pain, discharge and bleeding [5,9]. Some cases of LGV, particularly in the beginning of the outbreak, were misdiagnosed as Crohn's disease [10,11]. The complications of incorrectly treated or untreated LGV are serious, particularly for immunocompromised individuals, including genital ulcers, fistulas, rectal strictures and genital elephantiasis. LGV acquisition is associated with concurrent STI infections and reported behaviours such as condomless anal intercourse, fisting and the use of sex toys [2].

Discussion
----------
Since 2003, LGV diagnoses have increased over a 12-year period, with a steep rise since 2012, to reach unprecedented levels in 2015, suggesting high levels of ongoing transmission. Infection remains concentrated in white MSM living in London, many with HIV co-infection and other STIs.

The strength of this study lies in the unique national dataset of laboratory confirmed LGV diagnoses, which we linked to clinical data for the most recent complete year. During the study period, LGV testing was only recommended for symptomatic patients and LGV contacts. However, a large multicentre case-finding study in the UK found that 27 percent of LGV infections were detected in patients without rectal symptoms, suggesting that infections might be missed [12,13]. Patients might also be treated presumptively without LGV testing or never seek care, leading to further underestimation of LGV cases in the population. Other external factors might have influenced requests for LGV testing and the trends observed. These include the introduction of charging laboratories for LGV diagnostic testing (April 2014) and increased awareness of LGV among clinicians and microbiologists, which might have led to increased testing. We lack data on symptoms associated with LGV infection in this surveillance dataset.

The increase in LGV diagnoses coincides with upward trends in other STIs and sexually transmissible enteric infections among MSM, such as gonorrhoea, infectious syphilis, verotoxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ and _Shigella_ [14-17]. Contributory factors might include sexual networks with high rates of partner change facilitated by social media networking sites and chemsex, and we know that HIV-positive MSM who engage in HIV sero-adaptive behaviours and have condomless sex with other HIV-positive men remain at particularly high risk [15-17]. Our data suggest a need for a strengthened public health response to raise awareness of LGV among clinicians and patients. Social media might offer a means of rapid, low-cost dissemination of public health messages, with an additional benefit of facilitating user interaction [18].

There are also important implications for clinical management and microbiologists, including the need for robust partner notification, testing and treatment, and testing of HIV-positive MSM with asymptomatic _C. trachomatis_ infection for LGV [19]. LGV treatment requires an extended course of antibiotics over non-LGV _C. trachomatis_, such that some patients may unnecessarily receive multiple courses of antibiotics; this risks introducing selection pressure for antimicrobial resistance [20]. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for LGV in HIV-positive MSM with rectal symptoms, and consider treating presumptively for LGV according to national guidelines [21,22].

[Chlamydia are obligate intracellular bacteria that rely on host cell adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for energy production. Chlamydia have 2 forms: a non-replicating, infectious elementary body, analogous to a spore, and a replicating, non-infectious reticulate body. The elementary body induces its own endocytosis upon attachment to host cells, within which the elementary body converts to the replicating reticulate form. Up to several hundred progeny are produced within a large cytoplasmic inclusion. The reticulate body then reverts to the elementary form and is released by the cell through exocytosis. _Chlamydia trachomatis_ is transmitted through infected secretions, and infects mainly columnar epithelial cells, particularly in the cervix, rectum, urethra, throat, and conjunctiva.

Within the _C. trachomatis_ species, there are multiple serovars. The diseases caused by _C. trachomatis_ depend on the serovar: serovars A, B, Ba, and C cause trachoma; serovars D through K cause genital and perinatal infections; and serovars L1, L2, and L3 cause lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV).

LGV is spread by anal, oral, or vaginal sex without a condom. Transmission may also occur through sharing sex toys. Symptoms can occur between 3 to 30 days after infection. Small painless papules or ulcers may appear at the site of infection and may go unnoticed if the ulcer is in a place that is not readily visible (e.g., in the rectum, vagina, urethra, or mouth). LGV spreads from the initial site of inoculation, such as, urethra, rectum, cervix, or throat, to the regional lymph nodes through lymphatic drainage pathways. Swelling and redness of the skin overlying the enlarged, tender regional lymph nodes, such as in the groin area, may occur, followed in some patients by suppurative lymphadenitis and drainage through the skin from the involved lymph nodes. Painful bowel movements and urge to defecate (tenesmus) accompanied by blood, mucus, or pus from the rectum (or in the stools) may occur, especially among those who practice receptive anal intercourse, and can mimic inflammatory bowel disease. Untreated, LGV can cause chronic drainage and scarring, chronic swelling of the genitals, strictures, and infertility.

It is likely that cases of LGV proctocolitis, for example, represent only a fraction of the cases that have actually occurred. Without use of laboratory assays that can differentiate LGV from non-LGV _C. trachomatis_, many LGV cases can be misdiagnosed as non-LGV chlamydial rectal infection and treated with doxycycline 100 mg orally twice a day for 7 days (http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2010/proctitis.htm). The CDC recommends that at the time of the initial visit (before diagnostic tests for chlamydia are available), persons with a clinical syndrome consistent with LGV, including proctocolitis or genital ulcer disease with lymphadenopathy, should be presumptively treated for LGV (http://www.cdc.gov/std/tg2015/lgv.htm).

CDC STD Treatment Guidelines for LGV recommend the use of doxycycline, twice a day for 21 days. Alternative treatments are erythromycin or azithromycin. The CDC notes that persons with both LGV and HIV infection should receive the same LGV treatment as those who are HIV-negative. Persons who have had sexual contact with a patient who has LGV within the 60 days before onset of the patient's symptoms should be examined and tested for urethral, cervical, or rectal chlamydial infection depending on anatomic site of exposure and treated presumptively for exposure (doxycycline 100 mg PO BID for 7 days or azythromycin 1 gm PO as a single dose) (http://www.cdc.gov/std/tg2015/lgv.htm).

A recent article posted by ProMED-mail reported that HIV-infected MSM seek out other HIV-positive sex partners to avoid using condoms, which, of course, would allow transmission of syphilis, gonorrhea, and other sexually transmitted diseases, such as LGV, among HIV-infected MSM (ProMED-mail post Syphilis & gonococcal dis. - USA (04): (OR) rising incidence, MSM, HIV coinfect. 20140608.2527642). Some MSM who are HIV-negative may be taking pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, i.e., a pill containing a combination of 2 anti-HIV drugs, tenofovir and emtricitabine, to protect against HIV in a belief that they can avoid using a condom during high-risk sexual activity. These types of tactics may be at play in the LGV outbreaks. - Mod.ML
