Thirty head of cattle have died since October [2012] in the commune of Calenga, Caala municipality, about 23 km [14.3 mi] west of Huambo city, as a result of anthrax, a situation that is worrying the local administration.

Speaking to ANGOP today, Wednesday [21 Nov 2012], Lutonadio Samuel Ntima, administrator of the commune of Calenga, revealed that there is higher incidence in the villages of Lupili and Kassupi, at a time when the local government does not have vaccines to contain the disease. Ntima said that in his area of jurisdiction, over 130 head of cattle are reported to be affected by the disease and requiring urgent action by specialists of the veterinary services.

He reported that a team of experts of the Veterinary Services is working to contain the spread of the disease in the region. In the commune of Calenga, west of Huambo city, whose population is mainly dedicated to animal traction farming, they are controlling more than 24 000 heads of cattle owned by the farming families.

[Our thanks to Sabine for the translation of this report.

From this news report, which is patently incomplete, we can presume that the true mortality to date is in excess of the 30 + 130 cases reported, and in the absence of available vaccine can only get worse. A disaster. - Mod.MHJ
