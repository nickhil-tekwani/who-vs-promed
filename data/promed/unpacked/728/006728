----------------------------------------------------------------------
This note is to clarify information provided in the ProMED item referenced above.

The BC Ministry of Agriculture's Animal Health Centre is aware of the 2 horses mentioned, and is following up with the horses' veterinarian to ensure all the needed information is collected to verify the reports.

BC has conducted surveillance for West Nile virus in the following indicators: mosquitoes, humans, birds, and horses. West Nile virus has been detected in at least one of the indicators in each of the last 5 years with the exception of 2012. Horses with West Nile virus were detected in 2009, 2011, and 2013.

More information on West Nile virus surveillance in BC is available at http://www.bccdc.ca/dis-cond/a-z/_w/WestNileVirus/Surveillance/WNV_2014_Surveillance.htm and http://www.agf.gov.bc.ca/ahc/westnilevirus.htm.
