The Southwest Nebraska Public Health Department has confirmed a case of [a] hantavirus [infection] in the 9-county [Chase, Dundy, Frontier, Furnas, Hayes, Hitchcock, Keith, Perkins, and Red Willow] health district. This is the 1st reported case of hantavirus in the southwest Nebraska area in over 6 years.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, hantavirus infection is usually found in rural areas where forest, fields, and farms offer suitable habitat for rodents. Hantavirus in the US is spread to people from rodents like mice, most commonly when fresh rodent urine, droppings, or nesting materials are stirred up. Tiny droplets containing the virus get into the air and are then breathed in.

"This can easily happen when cleaning out grain bins, barns or old abandoned buildings," said Melissa Propp, RN.

Symptoms of hantavirus usually start out with vague flu-like symptoms approximately several days to 6 weeks after exposure. A fever for 3-5 days, headache, muscle aches, chills, non-productive cough, nausea, vomiting or other gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea or abdominal pain are common. Tiredness and lightheadedness may also be present. Most people recover fully but some cases of hantavirus may be severe or even fatal. "If you have flu-like symptoms and have cleaned out a building with evidence of rodents, alert your provider," states Propp.

It is important not to stir up dust by sweeping or vacuuming. Hantavirus [infections] can be prevented by following these tips:
- air out the building for a least 30 minutes prior to starting your cleaning. Open doors and windows to allow good air flow and leave the area while airing out;
- wear gloves while cleaning up urine and droppings. A dust mask may also be worn as additional protection;
- dampen the urine, droppings, and nesting materials with a mixture of 1-part bleach to 10 parts water or use a disinfectant. Allow to soak for 5 minutes prior to removal;
- clean counters, cupboards and other surfaces with disposable towels;
- mop floors rather than sweeping or vacuuming;
- for dirt floors wet the area down with bleach solution or disinfectant before removal of debris to keep down the dust;
- disinfect any tools used in the cleaning process with a bleach solution.
- wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after cleaning tools and disposing of materials.

[This is not the 1st case of a hantavirus infection in Nebraska. In May 2005, a western Nebraska man in his early 50s died after being infected with hantavirus. A 37-year-old rural Grant man became the state's 4th person to test positive for the potentially deadly hantavirus on 31 Aug 2002. A 30-year-old male of Lyman became the 1st person in 2002 to die from the disease in Nebraska on 13 Jun 2002. Other Nebraska cases include those of a 41-year-old male, of Champion, who was hospitalized in Kearney from 24 Jun 2002 to 14 Jul 2002 and another male, age not specified, of Benkleman, was diagnosed with the 1st known case of hantavirus in Nebraska in 1998. Both recovered. As of January 2017, Nebraska has reported 9 cases of hantavirus infection (https://www.cdc.gov/hantavirus/surveillance/reporting-state.html)

Although not mentioned, the hantavirus involved in these and the above case is likely Sin Nombre virus and its rodent host is the deer mouse (_Peromyscus manipulates_). Nebraska is within the geographic range of this rodent. Individuals in Nebraska and elsewhere within the range of this rodent are well advised to follow the recommendations listed above to avoid exposure to this virus.
