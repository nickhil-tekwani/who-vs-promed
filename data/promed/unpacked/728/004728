A 45 year old dairy labourer was today [24 Aug 2009] hospitalised here with
suspected human anthrax, an infection contracted from cattle. The labourer,
belonging to nearby Meermulikottai village, was admitted to the Government
Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College Hospital here with boils on his hand
and was found to be suffering from the rare human anthrax, hospital dean, C
Shanmugham, said. Shanmugham said the man, employed by a dairy owner to
milk the cattle, had developed the boils after he came in contact with an
affected cow. "Since the infection has been detected at an early stage, it
can be cured," Shanmugam said, adding the man was being treated in an
isolated ward.

District Animal Husbandry Department officials who visited the village,
however, claimed he was suspected to be suffering from cow pox. They have
collected samples from cattle in the area for further testing.

[We seem to have a difference of opinion as to the nature of this man's
"boils". Clarification is sought from our Indian members. It should be
noted that anthrax is widespread in Tamil Nadu. It is not "rare." In 2005,
OIE reported 10 outbreaks affecting cattle and small ruminants; 2006 8
outbreaks; 2007 12 outbreaks; and in 2008, 11 outbreaks. So the potential
is there for it to be a case of cutaneous anthrax.

Yes, I did come to know about this single patient who is a farmer near my
town. He owns 2 buffaloes, and one developed lesions on its udder. For
this, he took the animal to the local veterinarian who provided an unknown
medication for local application over the udder. This was applied by the
animal's owner, and after that, he was milking the cow with his bare hands.
Within 24 hours, he developed vesicular lesions on his fingers.
Fortunately, he came to the regional medical college hospital, where a
diagnosis of cutaneous anthrax was made. I am not aware of the details of
microbiological culture results yet. He is being treated in the hospital as
an inpatient following standard precautions with a betalactam antibiotic,
according to the information I got by telephone. The patient is stable
currently.

This is the 1st time a clinical diagnosis of cutaneous anthrax has been
made in this town. Though there were incidences of deaths of cattle in the
recent past in many villages, they were not due to anthrax, as determined
by the regional veterinary department.

Surprisingly, the buffalo with the infected udder is stable and alive, and
the other animal in the same stable has not yet developed any infection or
disease. I have yet to get the complete details.

In summary, this is the 1st documented case of human anthrax based on
clinical diagnosis in my town (Salem). Without any confirmation by the
clinical microbiology lab, it is very difficult to say that this lesion is
cutaneous anthrax. The affected animal also didn't succumb to the illness
as well.

[Our thanks to Dr Kumar for his informed comments. It sounds less and less
like cutaneous anthrax. A pathognomonic aspect of cutaneous anthrax is that
the inflamed lesions itch but are not painful.

The waves of livestock deaths in the area referred to by Dr Kumar followed
-- it was claimed -- from riverine toxic waste from textile dying units
(20080713.2131), toxic discharge from a bottling plant (20061215.3524), and
undetermined causes (20051118.3356). In the past, there have been frequent
reports of livestock anthrax as a result of discharges from local tanneries
in Tamil Nadu. - Mod.MHJ]
