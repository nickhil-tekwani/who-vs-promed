News from the Ebola response
----------------------------
Launch of the vaccination campaign
----------------------------------
On Mon 21 May 2018, the Minister of Health, Dr Oly Ilunga Kalenga, officially launched the 1st vaccination campaign in the history of the Democratic Republic of Congo against Ebola virus disease. In his address, the Minister of Health reassured the population and addressed rumors circulating in Mbandaka and the neighboring villages of Bikoro and Iboko about the disease and vaccination. He reminded [stressed] that the value that brings the whole response to the Ebola epidemic is patriotism, which begins with the love of neighbors. It is in the name of this love for the community that all inhabitants must invest in the response and play their role to stop the spread of the virus by respecting individual and collective hygiene measures, and if necessary by participating voluntarily in the vaccination campaign. He emphasized the important role of community relays, who must actively participate in raising awareness among the population, but also in following the contacts of confirmed Ebola cases, which is the pillar of the government response.

The 1st targets of vaccination are healthcare providers who have been directly exposed to confirmed cases of Ebola and who have the highest risk of developing the virus in the coming days. This [Mon 21 May 2018], a dozen health professionals volunteered to receive the vaccine. In the next 5 days, 100 people should be vaccinated, including about 70 health professionals. The Minister of Health explained that the Government's priority is to ensure that all these brave health professionals can do their job safely.

The 1st person to be vaccinated in this campaign was Dr Guillaume Ngoie, Director of the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI). With this gesture, he wanted to send a strong message to reassure the population about the safety of the Ebola vaccine, while reminding [stressing] that even the vaccinated people must continue to respect all recommended preventive measures.

- New deaths: bush meat
22 May 2018. 2 more die of Ebola in Congo, 7 new cases confirmed
Reuters [edited] https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-ebola/two-more-die-of-ebola-in-congo-seven-new-cases-confirmed-idUSKCN1IN0WP [Byline: Patient Ligodi]

Two more people have died from Ebola and 7 new cases were confirmed in Democratic Republic of Congo, authorities said on Tue [22 May 2018], but resistance to some public guidance about preventing the disease was evident in a provincial capital.

At the central market in Mbandaka, ... some residents said they were unmoved by warnings not to consume bush meat. "Despite your Ebola stories, we buy and eat monkey meat," said one woman, a mother of 8 children. "We have eaten that since forever. That is not going to change today. Ebola, that's in Bikoro."

Experts who have studied the Ebola virus from its discovery in 1976 along the Ebola river in Congo, then Zaire, say its suspected origin is forest bats. Links have also been made to the carcasses of freshly slaughtered animals eaten as bush meat.

One of the 2 new deaths occurred in Mbandaka, according to a daily healthy ministry bulletin. A nurse also died in the village of Bikoro, where the outbreak was first detected, ministry spokeswoman Jessica Ilunga told Reuters.

The 7 new confirmed cases were registered in Bikoro, the ministry said. The outbreak is believed to have killed at least 27 people so far. ...

Health officials administered an experimental vaccine on [Mon 21 May 2018] to 33 medical workers and Mbandaka residents, World Health Organization (WHO) spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told reporters in Geneva. The WHO said vaccine manufacturer Merck has provided it with 8640 doses of the vaccine and an additional 8000 doses are expected to be available in the coming days.

In remarks to the annual World Health Assembly on [Tue 22 May 2018] in Geneva, US Secretary of Health and Human Services, Alex Azar, announced that the US government would provide up to USD 7 million in additional funding to the Ebola response, on top of USD 1 million previously committed.

"The risk of spreading within the country and to neighboring nations remains real," said Dr Fatoumata Nafo-Traoré of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. "One of the lessons we learned in our response to other deadly Ebola outbreaks is that complacency can kill." ...

[The continued sale and consumption of bushmeat is a major problem for many reasons. For one, outbreaks are likely to continue to happen because of this practice. It is difficult to address as people have to eat. To change this, there needs to be education on the risk it presents and another food that appeals to the people as much as bush meat. - Mod.LK]

- New cases
22 May 2018. Congo announces 6 new confirmed cases of Ebola virus
CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) News, Associated Press (AP) [edited] http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/ebola-congo-1.4672744

Congo's health ministry announced 6 new confirmed Ebola cases and 2 new suspected cases Tue [22 May] as vaccinations entered a 2nd day in an effort to contain the deadly virus in a city of more than 1 million. ...

"In the next 5 days 100 people must be vaccinated, including 70 health professionals," Health Minister Oly Ilunga said. "The priority of the government is to ensure that all these brave health professionals can do their job safely."

Congo's health ministry said there are now 28 confirmed Ebola cases, 21 probable ones and 2 suspected. The 6 new confirmed cases were in the rural Iboko health zone, it said. Of the confirmed Ebola cases, 14 are in Iboko, 10 are in Bikoro where the outbreak began, and 4 are in the Wangata area of Mbandaka.

The death toll from hemorrhagic fever stands at 27, with 3 of them confirmed as Ebola. 2 of the Ebola victims were nurses, one in Iboko and the other in Bikoro. ...

The vaccine, developed at Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg and provided by US company Merck, is still in the test stages. But it was effective toward the end of the Ebola epidemic that killed more than 11 300 people in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia from 2014-2016.

Those who are vaccinated in outbreak areas still will have to strictly follow infection-control measures, especially since the vaccine doesn't protect immediately. It takes a week to 10 days, said Dr Pierre Rollin, an epidemiologist with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and a veteran of more than a dozen Ebola outbreaks.

Rollin warned that the large geographic area between Mbandaka and the remote towns where the outbreak's 1st cases were reported must be scoured for the infected and the people who have come into contact with them. "Travel from Mbandaka to Bikoro can take 4 hours to 4 days" depending on transportation and if it's raining, he said. "Before making any assumption we're going to have to look along this road and all the villages."

[The 6 new cases referred to in this report are likely the same cases reported by Reuters above as 7 new cases. It has been difficult to follow the numbers of cases, particularly which are truly new cases and which may have been probable or suspect cases, but then are confirmed. The cases that continue to be identified are likely hemorrhagic fever cases, which also can have alternative etiologies; thus the need for rapid testing if the vaccine will be administered to contacts. - Mod.LK]

- 22 May 2018. Vaccination. Scientists who toiled for years on an Ebola vaccine see the 1st one put to the test
STAT [edited] http://bit.ly/2KLYv4c [Byline: Helen Branswell]

[Now that the vaccine is being used in a real-world setting, it could prove to be a critical tool to contain outbreaks, [Heinz] Feldmann [who spearheaded the work to develop the vaccine while he was the head of special pathogens at Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory] said, even as he stressed the importance of other ways of responding to epidemics, including isolating cases early, monitoring the health of those who have been in close contact with the infected, and ensuring safe burial procedures.
"I think it's important that we have something to offer now and something that hopefully helps to contain this terrible disease," said Feldmann, who now heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases' virology laboratory in Hamilton, MT. ...

Lisa Hensley, who also contributed to the preclinical testing of the VSV vaccine, acknowledged her excitement comes with a side of nerves. "There is this moment of: It's now going into the field. And: Will it work?" Hensley said. "So in some ways you're holding your breath."]

[It will take a few weeks to know whether the vaccine is working, since protection is not instantaneous. The virus in the vaccine needs to replicate to stimulate antibody production. It is the antibody that is protective. - Mod.LK]

- 21 May 2018. Lessons from outside the box. Ebola in the DRC: what we can learn from Fukushima
The Conversation [edited] https://theconversation.com/ebola-in-the-drc-what-we-can-learn-from-fukushima-96814

Although the WHO said that it has now better tools to deal with the disease, the risk of the outbreak getting out of control still remains very high. So what should be done?
When looking for precedents on how to contain the disease, perhaps it might be useful to look to a completely different kind of disaster, such as the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster. I would argue that the Japanese authorities handling of the nuclear leak could provide salient lessons on how to deal with the Ebola outbreak. The 3 main actions the authorities took were: contain the risk, communicate progress and raise public awareness.

Contain the risk
----------------
The Japanese authorities saved thousands of lives by creating exclusion zones, guarded by roadblocks, to limit the public's exposure to radiation. The DRC might need to consider a similar approach to restrict movement between infected and non-infected areas to stop the virus spreading.
Exclusion zones would let the authorities screen people entering or exiting the zones, using infrared thermometers, say. And those people flagged as a likely risk, could be more thoroughly assessed.
Exclusion zones could also provide the opportunity to assess the health of people within the zones faster and more effectively.

Communicate progress
--------------------
Although creating exclusion zones will help the authorities contain the spread of the virus, it will also likely result in rumour, suspicion, and fear among the local populace. So it will be important for the authorities to develop an effective communication strategy to provide the latest information about the measures taken and, perhaps most importantly, the effectiveness of those measures.
In formulating a communication strategy, the authorities will need to think carefully about what information should be shared with the public and how to communicate it.

Raise public awareness
----------------------
Radiation seminars for school children were run annually in schools in Soma, a city in the north-eastern Fukushima Prefecture, in order to teach children about radiation. In a similar way, the DRC authorities need to step up awareness campaigns to help the public understand Ebola, its symptoms, how it spreads and, most importantly, how to avoid it when it is in the neighbourhood.
Awareness campaigns for school children and engagement with the broader public will raise awareness about the disease and help people avoid getting sick. These campaigns, by empowering people with knowledge, will ultimately establish stronger communities, and will prepare the public for subsequent outbreaks.

- 22 May 2018. Distrust of hospitals. DRC-Mbandaka: The Ebola patient who escaped from the localized hospital
Actualité [in French, machine trans., edited] https://actualite.cd/2018/05/22/rdc-mbandaka-la-malade-debola-qui-setait-evadee-de-lhopital-localisee/ [Byline: Patrick Maki]

An Ebola patient escaped last [Sat 19 May 2018] from Wangata Hospital in Mbandaka, Equateur, health authorities reported on [Mon 21 May 2018].
According to Dr Pierre Formenty, WHO Coordinator for Ebola Control in Mbandaka, the patient has been located and was found on [Tue 22 May 2018]. She fled the hospital while under observation to confirm whether or not a new case of Ebola.
"The person who escaped the day before yesterday was healing. We should test her to check her Ebola status, which we think was negative, but she escaped. We located her. ...

Asked about it by Actualite.CD, the Minister of Health, Dr Oly Ilunga calls the sick to be aware of the seriousness that the Ebola epidemic. "You have to know that a hospital is not a prison. We take all the measures to treat the sick, but I believe that patients must be equally aware and responsible. ..., " said the minister.

As of 20 May 2018, a total of 51 cases of haemorrhagic fever have been reported in the region, including 28 confirmed, 21 probable, and 2 suspected. 7 new cases confirmed in Iboko, 2 new cases suspected in Wangata, 1 death of a confirmed case in Wangata. The index case has not yet been identified, investigations are ongoing.

[See report in Medical Express below which describes a patient who had been hospitalised in Mbandaka, leaving the medical centre to seek out a local healer. That may be the patient in this report or there may be more than one leaving hospitals for local healers.

Dependence on folk medicine and overcoming superstitious beliefs about the cause of illness need to be added to the list of hurdles in stopping Ebola virus transmission. Integrating western medicine into the local culture so that it is accepted by the local population is a challenge that calls for sensitivity and good communication skills. People with influence in the community should be called upon to help. - Mod.LK]

- 22 May 2018. Combatting superstition. Superstition stopping Ebola victims from seeking medical care
MedicalXpress [edited] https://medicalxpress.com/news/2018-05-superstition-ebola-victims-medical.html

In Geneva on [Tue 22 May 2018], African health officials said they were preparing to send anthropologists to the DRC to help with an Ebola vaccination campaign.
A prototype vaccine will first be given to frontline health workers and then to people who have been in contact with Ebola cases.
"If we do not handle communication well, the vaccination programme may suffer," John Nkengasong, head of Africa Centres for Disease Control (Africa CDC), told reporters in Geneva.
"So we are also assessing how in the next 2 weeks or so to deploy anthropologists to support the vaccine efforts."

[...]

Two people infected with Ebola from Bikoro went to the churches rather than a medical centre for help, local witnesses said. Another patient, who had been hospitalised in Mbandaka, left the medical centre to seek out a local healer, they said.

To brake the spread of Ebola, "we have to convince villagers that the disease is not a curse," said Bavon N'Sa Mputu, an elected official from Bikoro, pointing to the key role that churches can play. ...

- 22 May 2018. Ebola outbreak in DRC on 'epidemiological knife-edge,' says WHO official
https://www.devex.com/news/ebola-outbreak-in-drc-on-epidemiological-knife-edge-says-who-official-92809 [Byline: Vince Chadwick]
Quarantine measures risk sending victims underground and away from the reach of health authorities, [Dr Peter Salama, deputy director-general of WHO emergency preparedness and response] said. Surveillance to check people's temperatures and triage potential Ebola cases for further tests were more effective, he added, with 80 checkpoints being established on the Congo River.

Salama said there are now 51 cases in DRC and 28 deaths in 3 locations in the country's northwest, including Mbandaka.
A "ring vaccination" campaign began [Mon 21 May 2018] targeting everyone who has lived with or visited a confirmed Ebola sufferer during the current outbreak, and the contacts of those contacts. Salama said the plan was to vaccinate around 1000 people in the next week. But response efforts are facing logistical challenges: the country's underdeveloped health system; remote, forested terrain; and the need to keep the vaccines between -60 and -80 deg Celsius in areas often without power.

In addition, the vaccine is yet to be licensed, meaning strict ethical protocols must be followed before it can be administered. "We have to sit and get individual informed consent from every person that is volunteering to take the vaccine ... If people say no we simply don't vaccinate," Salama said. "So that takes a while to explain. You can imagine for a rural population, many of whom are illiterate, to explain that this is an investigational product, that it might have some side effects -- even though we know it is a very safe and effective vaccine."

A predominantly governmental team from Guinea, one of the countries worst hit by the Ebola outbreak in 2014, is in DRC to help with the response, along with around 100 WHO staff and those from Médecins Sans Frontières, UNICEF, World Food Programme, and the Red Cross. Salama welcomed the show of solidarity from the Guineans, "who are about the only people in the world who've ever conducted ring vaccinations for Ebola," he said.]

It's going to take an estimated USD 26 million to quell the outbreak, and the U.S. has raised its contribution from USD 1 million to USD 8 million.
US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar on [Tue 22 May 2018] announced that the US is contributing an additional USD 7 million to fight the ongoing Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, following the US Agency for International Development's USD 1 million donation.

The World Health Organization estimates it will take at least USD 26 million to quell the current outbreak, and the US contribution brings the internationally raised total up to approximately USD 25.45 million.]

[It is good to see the US contributing generously to the control effort. Ebola virus presents a public health threat not only to the DRC, but the world. - Mod.LK]

- 22 May 2018. Emergency funds.
The Hill [edited] http://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/388818-us-and-global-community-has-to-keep-the-ebola-outbreak-from-spreading-dont [Byline: Peter Yeo]

The lesson from 2014 makes abundantly clear that Ebola outbreaks require funding that is immediately available and sustained to address the scope of the crisis.

The region is better prepared for an Ebola outbreak now, due to the sustained efforts of the US Agency for International Development, the US Department of Defense, the Centers for Disease Control, the National Institutes of Health and the World Health Organization.
Here's what's changed:
1. The capabilities of laboratories in the region have been boosted dramatically -- meaning that doctors and nurses can diagnose Ebola faster.
2. Doctors, nurses, and other public health professionals in the region have been better trained on how to treat Ebola patients without getting infected.
3. Emergency response operations centers have been established -- a "central command" for first responders -- to coordinate the response among agencies and governments.
4. An experimental Ebola vaccine has been developed, allowing health officials to vaccinate people in a ring around suspected outbreaks.
We are seeing the results of these changes now in the Democratic Republic of Congo. To put it simply: The world is better prepared for an infectious disease outbreak today than it was three years ago, and the global community can respond with more speed and agility.

22 May 2018. Could we predict the next Ebola outbreak by tracking the migratory patterns of bats?
EurekAlert!, American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) [edited] https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-05/lu-cwp052218.php

Lehigh University researchers' framework tracks the ecological drivers of bat migration patterns to predict the next Ebola outbreak.
Investigators from Lehigh [University] worked with satellite information and parameter sampling techniques to create their framework, which integrates data and modeling to predict the conditions linking bats' behavior with the outbreak of Ebola. They have detailed their work in a paper titled "A Predictive Spatial Distribution Framework for Filovirus-Infected Bats" published online today [Tue 22 May 2018] in _Scientific Reports_.
The model utilizes information on bat birth and death rates, the rate of infection of bats with the Ebola virus and recovery rates, bat mobility, seasonal changes and information about the availability of food and shelter to forecast bat infection peaks in a given region. ...

Villages, and sometimes whole regions of the Congo, are misplaced -- but the ministry of health and a team of cartographers are racing to get better data.
Almost all the maps of the outbreak zone that have thus far been released contain mistakes of this kind. Different health organizations all seem to use their own maps, most of which contain significant discrepancies. Things are roughly in the right place, but their exact positions can be off by miles, as can the boundaries between different regions.
Sinai, a cartographer at UCLA, has been working with the Ministry of Health to improve the accuracy of the Congo's maps. ...]
