A deadly encephalitis virus claimed a new victim Monday as it was reported
to have spread to Malaysia's southern historic state of Malacca, the
official Bernama news agency said. Bernama said the 43-year-old victim was
a pig farm worker admitted a month ago to Seremban Hospital in the worst
affected southern state of Negri Sembilan.
Goh Siow Huat, state unity and development committee chairman, confirmed
the death, adding 22 people were still being treated for the disease in
three hospitals around the country. The [Nipah virus which is carried by
pigs has so far killed some 100 people.
Abu Zahar said no farmers or residents in the area had been infected with
the virus, but the health department would step up monitoring. The virus
was believed to have spread to Malacca after people smuggled in infected
pigs from other states, he said.
