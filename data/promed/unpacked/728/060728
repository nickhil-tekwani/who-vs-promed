The World Health Organization (WHO) said today that yellow fever continues to march toward Brazil's Atlantic coast, where much of the urban population is unvaccinated against the mosquito-borne disease. Since the country's outbreak began in January [2017] in the interior state of Minas Gerais, experts have warned that urban transmission of yellow fever posed a huge threat to Brazil.

According to the WHO, as of [Mon 3 Apr 2017], there have been several suspected epizootic cases of yellow fever currently under investigation in Bahia state along the northern coastal area, including the urban area of Salvador.

An epizootic was confirmed to be caused by yellow fever virus infection in the municipality of Feira de Santana, and in the proximity of the urban area of Campinas in Sao Paulo State. In Rio de Janeiro state, epizootics are under investigation near both the city of Rio de Janeiro and near Niteroi, part of the same metropolitan area.

So far, yellow fever is currently being transmitted by 2 types [genera] of mosquitoes on Brazil, the _Haemagogus_ or _Sabethes_. If yellow fever is introduced to a major urban center, the virus could jump to the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, making human transmission more likely.

"There is no evidence of human cases of yellow fever virus infection transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_ the vector that could sustain urban transmission of yellow fever," the WHO said in its update.

For the 1st time since the yellow outbreak began, the WHO said travelers to the urban areas of Rio de Janeiro state and Sao Paulo should get vaccinated against yellow fever at least 10 days prior to their trip. Previously, the urban centers were excluded from this recommendation.

As of [Fri 31 Mar 2017], the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said Brazil had reported 1589 cases (1093 suspected and 496 confirmed). The vast majority of those cases, 1203, are in Minas Gerais state.

[Although the numbers of new cases in Minas Gerais and Espirito Santo states continue to decline, YF continues to spread geographically. So far, all cases are related to the sylvan (forest) cycle of transmission, with no reported cases due to _Aedes aegypti_ urban transmission. One hopes that the YF vaccination campaign will effectively halt the transmission to humans, although it may continue in non-human primates.

The state of Rio de Janeiro has confirmed a 2nd death due to yellow fever. The Municipal Health Department of Itaperuna, a city located in northwestern part of the state, confirmed on[Tue 4 Apr 2017] a 33-year-old man died on [Sun 26 Feb 2017] due to the disease.

Rio de Janeiro is one of the states on alert due to the growing number of yellow fever cases reported.

"Municipalities are [...] to prioritize the vaccination of people living in rural areas and near the forests. Our objective is to work together and support the municipalities so that the mobilizations for vaccination can be organized," stated Luiz Antônio Teixeira Jr, Health Secretary of Rio de Janeiro state last week [week of 26 Mar 2017].

Teixeira announced that the state had already distributed more than 3 million doses of vaccines against yellow fever since January [2017] to 92 municipalities in the state. According to the official the municipalities closer to the state of Minas Gerais, where the outbreak began, have been given priority.

The expectation of state officials is to vaccinate, until the end of this year [2017], the entire population of the state. This, say health authorities, will require between 8 and 9 million additional doses of the vaccine.

Last week [week of 26 Mar 2017].the state's health department confirmed a 6th case of yellow fever, 5 from Casimiro de Abreu, in the interior of Rio de Janeiro in an area that stretches inland between Buzios and Macaé and another from São Fidelis, about 100km [62.13 miles] from Casimiro.

In a press release the municipal secretary of Health of Itaperuna, Alexandre Martins, reassured the population that at the moment there are no suspected cases of yellow fever in the city of Rio.

[One hopes that the YF vaccination campaign will effectively halt the transmission to humans, although it may continue in non-human primates. Starting now, the Health Ministry has changed the regimen for the yellow fever vaccination. There will only be one dose applied for those planning to travel to areas in the country where the vaccination is advised. Up until now, the Brazilian vaccination regimen has included 2 doses, with the 2nd recommend to be taken 10 years after the 1st. The change was released on [Wed 1 Apr 2017]. The new treatment approach follows what the World Health Organization has been recommending since 2014.

This is an update to the WHO advice posted in the Disease Outbreak News of 27 Jan 2017, 6 Mar 2017, and 20 Mar 2017; and on the WHO International Travel and Health website on 31 Jan 2017, 14 Feb 2017, 6 Mar 2017, and 17 Mar 2017.

As of [Mon 3 Apr 2017], yellow fever virus transmission continues to expand towards the Atlantic coast of Brazil in areas not deemed to be at risk for yellow fever transmission prior to the revised risk assessment, supported by the scientific and technical advisory group on geographical yellow fever risk mapping (GRYF).

As of [Mon 3 Apr 2017], epizootics and human cases are under investigation for yellow fever virus infection in Bahia State along the northern coastal area, including the urban area of Salvador, with an epizootic confirmed to be due to yellow fever virus infection in the municipality of Feira de Santana; epizootics associated with yellow fever virus infection were confirmed in the proximity of the urban area of Campinas in São Paulo State, with additional epizootics being under investigation in the same area; and, in Rio de Janeiro State, epizootics are under investigation for yellow fever virus infection in the proximity of the urban areas of Rio de Janeiro City and Niterói. These reports are consistent with the increased yellow fever activity observed in the southern areas of Bahia State, bordering Espírito Santo and Minas Gerais States, and in areas of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo States, all sharing the same ecosystem - tropical and sub-tropical moist broad leaves forest. As of [Mon 3 Apr 2017], there is no evidence of human cases of yellow fever virus infection transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_, the vector that could sustain urban transmission of yellow fever.

Therefore, the WHO Secretariat has determined that the following areas in the States of Bahia, Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo should also be considered at risk for yellow fever transmission:

- Bahia State: Municipalities of Agua Fria, Acajutiba, Aiquara, Alagoinhas, Amelia Rodrigues, Amargosa, Anguera, Antonio Cardoso, Apora, Apuarema, Aracas, Aracatu, Aramari, Aratuipe, Aurelino Leal, Barra da Estiva, Barra do Rocha, Barrocas, Biritinga, Boa Nova, Boa Vista do Tupim, Bom Jesus da Serra, Breoes, Cabaceiras do Paraguacu, Cachoeira, Caetanos, Cairu, Camacari, Camamu, Candeal, Candeias, Caraibas, Cardeal da Silva, Castro Alves, Catu, Conceicada Feira, Conceicado Almeida, Conceicado Jacuipe, Conde, Contendas do Sincora, Coracade Maria, Cravolandia, Cruz das Almas, Dario Meira, Dias d'Avila, Dom Macedo Costa, Elisio Medrado, Entre Rios, Esplanada, Feira de Santana, Gandu, Gongogi, Governador Mangabeira, Guajeru, Iacu, Ibirapitanga, Ibirataia, Igrapiuna, Iguai, Inhambupe, Ipecaeta, Ipiau, Ipira, Irajuba, Iramaia, Irara, Itaberaba, Itagi ,Itagiba, Itamari, Itanagra, Itaparica, Itaquara, Itatim, Itirucu, Itubera, Jacaraci, Jaguaquara, Jaguaripe, Jandaira, Jequie, Jiquirica, Jitauna, Lafaiete Coutinho, Laje, Lajedo do Tabocal, Lamarao, Lauro de Freitas, Licinio de Almeida, Madre de Deus, Maetinga, Manoel Vitorino, Marau, Maracas, Maragogipe, Marcionilio Souza, Mata de Sao Joao, Milagres, Mirante, Mortugaba, Muniz Ferreira, Muritiba, Mutuipe, Nazare, Nilo Pecanha, Nova Ibia, Nova Itarana, Ouricangas, Pedrao, Pindai, Pirai do Norte, Planaltino, Pojuca, Presidente Janio Quadros, Presidente Tancredo Neves, Rafael Jambeiro, Riachao do Jacuipe, Rio Real, Sao Felix, Sao Felipe, Sao Francisco do Conde, Sao Goncalo dos Campos, Sao Miguel das Matas, Sao Sebastiao do Passe, Salinas da Margarida, Salvador, Santa Barbara, Santa Ines, Santa Teresinha, Santanopolis, Santo Amaro, Santo Antonio de Jesus, Santo Estevao, Sapeacu, Saubara, Sebastiao Laranjeiras, Serra Preta, Serrinha, Simoes Filho, Tanhacu, Tanquinho, Taperoa, Teodoro Sampaio, Teofilandia, Teolandia, Terra Nova, Ubaira, Ubaitaba, Ubata, Urandi, Valenca, Varzedo, Vera Cruz, Wenceslau Guimaraes;

- Rio de Janeiro State: Urban areas of Rio de Janeiro City and Niterói. The addition of these urban areas makes the entire State of Rio de Janeiro at risk for yellow fever transmission;

- São Paulo State: Urban area of Campinas.

Consequently, vaccination against yellow fever is recommended for international travellers visiting those areas in the States of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. The typology of activities that international travellers anticipate to undertake while visiting areas determined to be at risk for yellow fever transmission should be weighted in the risk-benefit analysis informing the individual decision to be immunized against yellow fever.

There are no other additional changes with respect to other areas of Brazil determined to be at risk for yellow fever transmission in 2013, as published by WHO in the Disease Outbreak News on 27Jan 2017, 6 Mar 2017, and 20 Mar 2017.

The determination of new areas considered to be at risk for yellow fever transmission is an ongoing process and updates will be provided regularly.

The current advice by the WHO Secretariat for international travellers going to areas of Brazil deemed to be at risk is the following:

- Vaccination against yellow fever at least 10 days prior to the travel. Note that, as per Annex 7 of the International Health Regulations (2005), a single dose of a yellow fever vaccine approved by WHO is sufficient to confer sustained immunity and life-long protection against yellow fever disease. Travellers with contraindications for yellow fever vaccine (children below 9 months, pregnant or breastfeeding women, people with severe hypersensitivity to egg antigens, and severe immunodeficiency) or over 60 years of age should consult their health professional for advice;

- Adoption of measures to avoid mosquito bites;

- Awareness of symptoms and signs of yellow fever;

- Seeking care in case of symptoms and signs of yellow fever, while travelling and upon return from areas at risk for yellow fever transmission.

For 2017, updates on requirements for the International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis, with proof of vaccination against yellow fever, and WHO vaccination recommendations for international travellers, are available on the WHO International Travel and Health website: Annex 1 and country list. More specific information about requirements for the International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis, with proof of vaccination against yellow fever, implemented by Member States in the Region of the Americas is available on the PAHO yellow fever website.

The U.S. Embassy advises U.S. citizens in Colombia to carry evidence of yellow fever vaccination. Although there has not been a single case of yellow fever diagnosed in Colombia this year [2017], neighboring Brazil continues to experience a large outbreak. The Colombian Ministry of Health and Social Protection has initiated a campaign to ensure all residents have been vaccinated against yellow fever. Airlines and the media have reported confusion over which travelers need yellow fever vaccination.

The embassy recommends that all travelers between the ages of 1 - 60 years receive the yellow fever vaccine at least 10 days before traveling to areas in Colombia (https://www.minsalud.gov.co/Documents/mapa-5.pdf) determined to be at high risk of yellow fever transmission. Bogota, Cartagena, and Medellin are not high risk areas. National parks located in high risks areas may deny entry to travelers who do not have proof of yellow fever vaccination. Airlines may request vaccination cards for passengers traveling to high risk areas, and may screen passengers for symptoms of yellow fever. One dose of the vaccine provides life-long immunity, so boosters are not usually recommended or required. U.S. citizens should travel with their yellow International Certificate of Vaccination.

The following individuals should not receive the yellow fever vaccine: children under the age of 9 months, pregnant women, adults over the age of 60, people with a life-threatening condition, an immune deficiency, a thymus disorder or allergic to eggs.

[This report raises some interesting concerns about risk of yellow fever (YF) spread beyond Brazil. Viremic individuals could move considerable distances from Brazil in a short period of time. Should those travelers arrive in YF-free countries that have significant populations of _Aedes aegypti_ and little YF vaccine coverage of their human residents, an urban outbreak could be triggered. Health authorities in countries meeting these criteria would be well advised to have contingency plans in place now should that occur. - Mod.TY.
