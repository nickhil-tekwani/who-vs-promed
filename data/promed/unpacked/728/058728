It is interesting to me that, anecdotally at least, what are called
"vaccine failures" may still not be associated with high mortality. Is it
possible that, e.g. the vaccine stimulates the production of antibodies
that do not prevent infection, but which perhaps somehow lessen the
severity the disease? Are there any data that specifically address the
question of mortality rates in the so-called influenza vaccine "failure"
group compared with unvaccinated cohorts?

There are several things that need to be looked at to assess whether or not
a influenza vaccine has failed.
1. Strain of virus causing disease. This can be accomplished with the
cultures that have been obtained.
2. Whether or not the vaccine contained the strain.
The influenza vaccine contains H3N2,H5N1,H1N1,H3N2. If it is a strain
other than these it was not made to protect against it.

The Texas Department of Health has also observed influenza outbreaks in
vaccinated, institutionalized populations this flu season. One outbreak
occurred in a state school population where virtually all of the residents
were vaccinated, and some of the staff. The medical director in that
facility reported that although the ill patients did have clinical and
culture-confirmed influenza A, they were actually tolerating their
illnesses fairly well. It may be that in medically fragile populations the
vaccine will not be completely effective in preventing illnesses, but may
still be important for limiting the severity of disease.
Once again, it is vital to have high vaccination rates among staff as well
as residents in institutional settings, since the literature well documents
that the staff have more contact with the community at large and usually
are responsible for introducing the virus into the institution to begin with.
