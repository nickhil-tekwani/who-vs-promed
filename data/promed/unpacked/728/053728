The number of reported measles cases has been steadily increasing
since October 2010, creating a 3rd epidemic wave of increased
amplitude, according to the latest figures released by L'Institut de
Veille Sanitaire (INVS) on Tue 28 Jun 2011. An epidemic peak was
observed in March 2011 (with about 3600 cases), followed by a slight
decrease in the number of cases in April 2011 (with about 3100
cases).

In total, nearly 20 000 cases of measles have been recorded in France
since 1 Jan 2008, the date judged to mark the beginning of the
epidemic. In 2010, the health authorities reported 8 cases with
neurological complications and 287 cases of pneumonia related to the
illness.

Infants younger than one year remain the group most affected by the
disease, followed by those aged between 11 to 20 years of age, and by
children aged 1-5 years.

Measles vaccination was the main theme of the European Immunization
Week, held between 26 Apr and 2 May this year [2011]. The French
health authorities have been emphasizing the importance of vaccination
for the control of measles virus infection.

Since 1 Jan 2008, nearly 20 000 cases of measles have been reported
throughout metropolitan France. An increase in the number of cases
reported since October 2010 signified a 3rd major epidemic wave
compared with the 2 earlier waves. The 3rd epidemic peaked in March
2011 (over 3600 cases), followed by a slight decrease in April 2011
(more than 3100 cases). The peak number of cases occurred in early
April 2011 and was followed by a marked decline in May 2011. In 2010,
8 neurological complications (encephalitis or myelitis) and 287 severe
pneumonia cases were reported. Two patients died.

So far in 2011, there have been 14 cases with neurological
complications, 444 cases with severe pneumonia, and 6 deaths.

Seasonal variation in the incidence of measles is well known,
consequently the decline in recent weeks must not lead to a relaxation
of efforts to achieve high immunization coverage.

Confirmed cases of measles in the West Midlands [of England] have
nearly doubled this year [2011]. Laboratory experts have identified 24
cases of the deadly disease in the region since 1 Jan 2011, compared
with 13 during the same period last year [2011]. That is despite more
people getting the MMR [mumps, measles and rubella] vaccine.

Dr Musarrat Afza, regional immunisation head for the Health
Protection Agency, said: "We're very encouraged to see that MMR
[vaccine] uptake is continuing at high levels, indicating increasing
levels of trust by parents in the immunisation programme. But anyone
who missed out on MMR as a child will continue to be at risk of
measles, which explains why we are seeing these new cases in a broad
age range."

Confirmed cases of measles rose nationally from 374 during the 1st
half of last year [2010] to 496 cases this year [2011]. Dr Afza warned
that school trips and family holidays could spread the infectious
illness even faster over the summer if children were not vaccinated.

http://news.scotsman.com/health/Surge-in-measles-cases-causes.6793579.jp


Cases of measles have increased in Scotland in the past year. Health
Protection Scotland (HPS) said that in the 1st 24 weeks of 2011, they
had received 54 reports of suspected measles and 22
laboratory-confirmed cases. In the same period in 2010, there were 38
reports of suspected measles and no confirmed cases. And, for the
whole of last year [2010], Scotland saw only 11 confirmed cases of the
illness, the HPS report found.

HPS said the cases had been seen in young people who may not have
received full vaccination against measles as children. The report
said: "This year [2011], the increase in measles has predominantly
been in young adults -- late teens and early 20s -- an age group which
may not have routinely been offered 2 doses of MMR (measles, mumps and
rubella vaccine] as children."

HPS said there had been a small number of clusters of cases of
measles reported but without any spread into the general community.
"Some of the cases have had links to [mainland] Europe, where large
increases in measles have been seen this year [2011], but others have
no apparent links outside Scotland or the UK," the report said.

Figures from England and Wales have also indicated a surge in measles
cases, with suspicions many infections could have been picked up
overseas. In 2004 and 2005, cases of mumps in Scotland and the rest of
the UK increased massively, with more than 5000 cases in 2005 in
Scotland alone. Uptake of the MMR jab in children has increased in
recent years in Scotland.

[This is an extract from a longer article concerning families who had
returned home to escape the conflict in Libya.]

Many migrants arrived with measles, leading IRC, WHO, and UNICEF to
launch vaccination campaigns for children aged 6 months to 15 years. A
national measles vaccination campaign will soon be launched to contain
the spread of the disease. As of 19 Jun 2011, some 5311 people had
contracted the disease across 20 of Chad's 22 regions since the
beginning of the year [2011], with 63 deaths thus far, according to
Chad's Health Ministry.

"We are vaccinating children as soon as they arrive at transit
centres, so the disease should not spread further," Felix Liger, IRC
Chad country director, told IRIN. Many migrants are arriving run-down,
malnourished and dehydrated, he said, increasing their receptiveness
to the disease.

A measles outbreak has left 20 children dead in Ngorongoro district
in the last 10 weeks, the district's medical officer, Dr Kennedy
Israel, has said. Dr Israel said on Wednesday [29 Jun 2011] that the
highly contagious disease, also known as "rubeola", was 1st reported
in the Kakesio Village in late April 2011. He said that, from then
onwards, the disease has been spreading and that the 20 children who
have lost their lives were among the 650 infections recorded in the
area.

"And that is only the number of [those] that have been officially
reported, but we suspect that the death toll could be higher because
Ngorongoro is a vast district with much of its localities hidden in
remote thickets," said the DMO. Ngorongoro, which is mostly a
conservation area with a fraction of its geographical area inhabited,
has a population of 170 000 people.

The death toll figure surpasses the overall measles deaths reported
by the government last week, whereby 10 people had died in the
district, 7 in Dar es Salaam and one in the Southern Highlands.

"All the necessary steps towards containing the outbreak have been
taken," said Dr Israel, adding that children in the district are
currently being vaccinated with MMR immunization. However, the efforts
to vaccinate the juvenile population in Ngorongoro district is being
challenged by the fact that most of the area residents are nomadic
pastoralists, tending livestock and searching for both water and
greener pastures. "As a result, whenever we visit a household or
village, chances are the occupants would be gone, and in the remote
areas of Ngorongoro, villages are usually located up to 50 km from
each other," explained the DMO.

The Ngorongoro District Hospital's health secretary Ms Josephine
Elikashe said that in addition to the efforts being taken to contain
the situation, her hospital had initiated outreach programmes to
educate people on how to identify early signs of measles and what
action to take. Medical experts say that there is no specific
treatment for measles, but most patients with uncomplicated measles
will recover with rest and supportive treatment.

For his part, the area member of parliament, Mr Saning'o Ole Telele,
said that while precautions are being taken at the district level, his
office has taken things to a higher level by presenting the matter to
both regional and national levels.

An outbreak of measles has badly affected Sikwakataiya VDC [village
development community] in Mahottari district. The disease has affected
more than 400 children of wards no. 2, 3 and 4 in the VDC
simultaneously.

The majority of the population belong to the Muslim community in the
VDC. The disease has affected mostly children aged 1 to 5 years. Two
months ago, the disease was seen only in 5 children in the VDC, but
now it has affected 80 per cent of children in the village.

According to social worker Yunus Ansari, the VDC was [alarmed] by the
disease situation [following the appearance of] the outbreak of the
disease in the VDC and [because] vaccine against measles [had] not
reached the VDC. The [Nepalese] Ministry of Health and Population is
administering a programme of free measles vaccination.

Health worker Ram Pratap Mandal said that among the disease-affected
children, 80 per cent [had not been vaccinated].

As of 20 Jun 2011, 156 cases of measles in the US have been reported
to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) this year
[2011], according to Paramus health officer John Hopper. The health
officer advised that 136 confirmed cases are considered to be
import-associated, highlighting the importance of vaccinating
individuals prior to international travel. Measles is still present in
most parts of the world including Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and
Africa.

Four New Jersey residents with measles (3 confirmed, one probable)
have been reported to CDC since 1 Jan 2011. Two of those residents had
a known link to cases imported from France and Italy, one had traveled
to Pakistan, and the probable case had no travel history or known
exposure.

Measles is a highly communicable viral disease that is transmitted by
contact with droplets from the nose, mouth, or throat of an infected
person. Sneezing and coughing can put contaminated droplets into the
air. Infected individuals are contagious from 4 days prior to rash
onset through the 4th day after rash appearance.

Measles presents both in adults and children as an acute illness
characterized by fever (over 101 F; over 38.3 C) and generalized
maculo-papular rash. The rash lasts 5-6 days, usually starts on the
face and proceeds down the body, including the palms and soles. Signs
and symptoms of a cold, light sensitivity, cough, conjunctivitis, and
Koplik spots (tiny white spots inside the mouth) can also present.
Complications include diarrhea, otitis media , pneumonia,
encephalitis, and may lead to death. The incubation period for measles
ranges from 7 to 18 days.

Routine immunization is highly effective for preventing measles.
People who are not immunized, or who have not received the full 2 dose
schedule, are at high risk for contracting the disease. Parents of
children who attend a summer day camp should make sure that their
child is age-appropriately immunized. Adults and children over 12
months of age traveling outside the United States should have
documented proof of immunity to measles. Children between 6-12 months
of age who will be traveling internationally are also recommended to
receive a dose of MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine prior to
travel, although this dose does not count towards completion of the
routine schedule.

In January 2011, measles was diagnosed in 3 New Zealand residents
recently returned from a 17-day trip to Singapore and the Philippines.
On 11 Jan 2011, they had flown on a 7.5 hour flight from Singapore to
Brisbane, Australia, remained in a transit lounge for 9.5 hours, and
then continued on a 4 hour flight to Auckland, New Zealand. Searches
in Australia and New Zealand for secondary cases among passengers on
either flight resulted in the identification of 3 cases among
passengers on the Singapore-to-Brisbane flight and 5 cases among
passengers on the Brisbane-to-Auckland flight.

The 3 index cases had rash onsets occurring 11-15 Jan 2011 and tested
positive for measles immunoglobulin M (IgM). One Australian case and
one New Zealand case were diagnosed clinically, but the remaining 6
secondary cases, whose rashes developed on 21 to 26 Jan 2011, were
positive for measles RNA by nucleic acid amplification testing. Each
specimen was genotype D9 with the same genetic sequence. Only 3 of the
8 secondary cases were in people seated within 2 rows of a person with
an index case: 2 in unvaccinated people and one in a person whose
measles vaccination status was unknown. One secondary case was in a
person of unknown vaccination status seated 4 rows away from the
nearest person with an index case; one was in a person with a history
of having been vaccinated against measles twice who was seated 6 rows
away, and 3 were in unvaccinated children 11 rows away in a separate
cabin. The 3 index cases were in unvaccinated children aged 12-17
years.

Australian contact investigation guidelines for exposure to a single
passenger with infectious measles aboard an aircraft focus on the
seats within 2 rows of the index case (1); 5 of the 8 secondary cases
in this outbreak were in people who were farther away. It is likely
that 3 people were infectious aboard the aircraft (not one), and
recent literature suggests that exposure might extend farther than 2
rows (2,3). In addition, because measles is readily transmissible
through airborne transmission, the opportunity for exposure existed in
the jetways, the arrival and departure terminals, and the transit
lounge. This outbreak highlights the transmissibility of measles and
the risk for exposure during international travel, which may start at
the airport before departure, and the need for travelers to be
protected against measles by vaccination.

[Interested readers are referred to the original document to view the
literature references and the authorship of the article. This analysis
reinforces the need for travelers to be vaccinated against measles to
protect themselves and their home communities. It further suggests
that the risk of transmission of measles virus infection is not
limited to those in seat/rows adjacent to an index case. - Mod.CP]

The news of a freshly imported case of measles brings the total
number of confirmed cases in Auckland's largest outbreak this year
[2011] to 39. Auckland Regional Public Health Service (ARPHS) medical
officer of health, Dr Richard Hoskins, says that since 9 of the cases
are not able to be linked to cases from Oratia, plus another case from
overseas, the focus now must be on immunisation.

"Given the level of community spread, this is the only option
remaining to try to limit the spread of measles," says Dr Hoskins.
"Immunisation is the only way to avoid getting measles. The
vaccination is funded for children, young people and unimmunised
adults. These new cases have been in several early childhood centres,
and we are now working with those centres to quarantine susceptible
contacts at home in case they develop measles," says Dr Hoskins. "We
strongly advise all children receive 2 doses of the MMR (measles,
mumps, rubella) vaccine at 15 months and 4 years. We also strongly
advise catch up vaccinations for adolescents and adults who have had
either none, or only one dose of MMR vaccine, particularly if they are
intending to travel overseas."

Dr Hoskins says passengers on a recent flight from Bangkok to
Auckland might have been exposed to the measles virus. Thai Airways
flight TG491 landed in Auckland on Sun 19 Jun 2011, carrying a
passenger who was in the early stages of measles and capable of
infecting others. "All passengers onboard the flight who have not had
the right number of measles immunisations for their age, or are
unsure, should be vigilant if they suspect they could have measles,"
says Dr Hoskins. "We will be trying to contact a number of passengers
who were sitting close to the passenger with measles."

ARPHS advises that common symptoms of measles include a runny nose,
cough, sore eyes and fever, followed by a raised red rash that starts
on the face and moves to cover the rest of the body." Anyone,
including passengers on Thai Airways flight TG491 on 19 Jun 2011,
displaying symptoms of measles should immediately telephone their
doctor, or Healthline on 0800 611 116, for advice. It is important to
call 1st because measles is highly infectious, and people with it can
infect others in the waiting room," says Dr Hoskins.

Auckland's measles epidemic is worsening, with health officials
saying new cases coming from overseas are adding to the woes. The
latest outbreak is linked to a Thai Airways flight, TG491, which
landed in Auckland on 19 Jun 2011 with a passenger in the early stages
of measles and capable of infecting others. It has led to warnings to
anyone on the plane to have check-ups and brings the total number with
measles confirmed to 39, the largest outbreak the region has seen this
year [2011].

The Bangkok measles case is just one of 9 separate outbreaks medical
authorities are dealing with. Hoskins said the 9 outbreaks were not
able to be linked to cases from Oratia, where the alarm 1st started.
"Given the level of community spread, this is the only option
remaining to try to limit the spread of measles," said Hoskins.

"Prompt identification can help limit the spread of measles to
others, particularly vulnerable groups within the community," said
Hoskins.

As the measles outbreak continues in Hawke's Bay, schools and early
childhood centres that have a measles case reported will be asked by
public health [staff] to exclude any child not immunised or who can't
produce an up-to-date immunisation certificate to help prevent the
virus spreading.

Hawke's Bay District Health Board medical officer of health Lester
Calder said a recent measles case at Henry Hill School, Napier
highlighted the importance of ensuring immunisation certificates were
up-to-date and copied to schools or childhood centre management, as 48
per cent of the school roll had to be excluded until immunisation
records could be produced. This number has now dropped to 7 per cent
of children being excluded.

Dr Calder said this was the 3rd school which had to exclude pupils
while they awaited immunisation certificates. "Excluding children
caused family disruption often impacting on parents' ability to work,
and it could so easily be prevented by ensuring children's
immunisations were up-to-date and their immunisation record was copied
to the school or childcare centre.

The district health board is waiting for final genotyping to come
back to prove all cases were linked to an initial case in Auckland;
however, genotype information received so far suggested all the cases
were linked.

The high level of immunity in Hawke's Bay had prevented a much
greater epidemic, but there had been clusters in Flaxmere, Hastings,
Napier and Maraekakaho, highlighting how contagious this virus was, Dr
Calder said. If a measles case was reported at a school or childcare
centre, children not immunised or who didn't have an immunisation
certificate as part of their school record would be excluded from
school for 2 weeks until an immunisation certificate was produced. If
there was a further case, children not immunised or without an
immunisation certificate would be excluded for a further 2 weeks.

Since April 2011, 25 cases of the highly contagious virus have been
reported in Hawke's Bay, and of those, 4 including one adult have been
hospitalised.
