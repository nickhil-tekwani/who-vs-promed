According to the Ministry of Extreme Situations in Kyrgyzstan, 9
inhabitants of the Moscovskiy district of the Chuiskiy region are
infected with brucellosis. Regional veterinary stations report that
cases of brucellosis in cattle have been registered in the territory
of Predtechensky.
Between 12 and 19 Sep 2006 the Regional Center of the State sanitary
epidemiological supervision, together with group of family doctors,
have checked the population for cases of brucellosis. Of 40 persons
examined, 9 patients with brucellosis have been found.

[According to the press-service of the Ministry of Health of
Kyrgyzstan, 1831 cases of acute brucellosis have been registered
among the population of Kyrgyzstan in the first half of 2006 (1392
cases was registered for the similar period in 2005).
Hygienic standards are frequently not observed in the sale of meat
and dairy products. The population quite often does not hand over
sick animals to veterinarians for slaughter. In addition, lowered
vigilance among doctors has led to late diagnosis. - Mod.NP]
[According to OIE's Handistatus data base, Kyrgyzstan is endemically
infected with both bovine (_Brucella abortus_) and ovine-caprine (_B.
melitensis_) brucellosis. It might be assumed that the latter is more
widespread.
Clinical manifestations of _B. melitensis_ infections in humans are
generally regarded to be more severe than infections by _B. abortus_.
It will be interesting to note which bacterium was involved in the
brucellosis cases in humans referred to in the current news item.
Though mostly affecting sheep and goats, _B. melitensis_ is capable
of infecting bovines as well, causing udder infections rather than
abortions. This might result in disease cases in herdsmen and in
consumers of dairy products. - Mod.AS]
[It is not stated in the posting what symptoms were found in those
diagnosed with brucellosis or whether it was just a serologic
finding. A map of Kyrgyzstan showing its location in central Asia
west of China can be found at:
