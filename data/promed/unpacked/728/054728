_Acanthamoeba_ infections from contact lens solution
--------------------------------------------------------------
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) continues to receive reports from
ophthalmologists that cases of _Acanthamoeba_
keratitis, a potentially blinding infection, are
occurring in the United States.
Multiple cases of infection caused by
_Acanthamoeba_ have occurred since 26 May 2007,
the day the FDA announced the outbreak and the
manufacturer issued a recall of the implicated
multipurpose contact lens solution. The contact
lens user in at least 4 of these cases continued
to use AMO Complete MoisturePlus multi-purpose
contact lens solution and subsequently developed symptoms after the recall.
The CDC has also learned during the interview
stage of its investigation of the outbreak that
many contact lens users do not know that AMO
Complete MoisturePlus multi-purpose contact lens
solution has been recalled from the market
because of its association with _Acanthamoeba_ keratitis.
Healthy contact lens users from across the U.S.
were interviewed by the CDC as part of the
ongoing investigation. They were asked if they
had heard of a recalled contact lens solution
and, if so, could they identify the name of that
solution. Among the 151 people interviewed:
52.3 percent (79/151) were not aware of the
recall Among those who were aware of the recall,
only 26.8 percent (19/72) could correctly name
the recalled product. Of 15 people who reported
using AMO Complete MoisturePlus multi-purpose
contact lens solution in April 2007, 80 percent
(12/15) were still unaware of the recall and were still using the product.
While the FDA moved swiftly and worked with the
manufacturer to enact this recall, millions of
bottles of the solution, purchased prior to the
recall, might still be in the homes of contact
lens wearers. We are concerned that this lack of
awareness among the general public, as well as
eye care providers, is leading to continued use
of the product by those who had purchased it
prior to the recall. (It is often sold in bulk
packaging at warehouse stores and bottles have a long expiration date).
Help is being sought to get the word out:
- Check your medicine cabinet for AMO Complete
MoisturePlus multipurpose contact lens solution.
- Stop using the product immediately and contact
the company at 1-888-899-9183 or on the AMO
website for instructions on what to do with unused solution;
- Discard all soft contact lenses used with AMO Complete MoisturePlus;
- Discard all contact lens storage cases used with AMO Complete MoisturePlus;
- Consult your eye care provider about choosing
an alternative contact lens solution;
- Visit your eye care provider if you experience
any signs of eye infection, including eye pain or
redness, blurred vision, sensitivity to light,
sensation of something in the eye, or excessive tearing, and;
- Visit the CDC's Acanthamoeba website for
further instructions on contact lens use and other information.

[The problem with contact lens solution is that
the user may use it for weeks before purchasing a
new bottle, and may not notice recall messages before that time. ï¿½ Mod.EP]
