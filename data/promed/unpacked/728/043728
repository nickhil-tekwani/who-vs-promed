CDC is collaborating with public health officials in a number of
states, including Oregon, Washington, California, and Maryland and the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to investigate a multistate
outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Panama infections.
Investigators are using DNA analysis of _Salmonella_ bacteria obtained
through diagnostic testing to identify cases of illness that may be
part of this outbreak.

As of 22 Mar 2011, 12 persons infected with the outbreak strain of
_S._ Panama have been reported from Oregon (5 cases), Washington (4
cases), California (2 cases), and Maryland (1 case). Reported dates of
illness onset range from 5 Feb 2011 to 23 Feb 2011. Ill persons range
in age from less than 1 year to 68 years, with a median age of 12
years. 66 percent are male. Among ill persons, 2 have been
hospitalized and no deaths have been reported.

Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------------
Collaborative investigative efforts of state, local, and federal
public health and regulatory agencies have linked this outbreak to
eating cantaloupe. 11 of 12 ill persons reported eating cantaloupe in
the week before illness. 10 of these 11 ill persons ate cantaloupes
purchased at 7 different locations of a national warehouse club.
Information gathered with patient permission from membership card
records helped determine that ill persons purchased cantaloupes
sourced from a single farm. Product traceback information indicates
these cantaloupes were harvested from a single farm in Guatemala. FDA
is working closely with CDC, authorities in states where illnesses
have occurred, and the firms involved to investigate the source of the
contamination.

Recall information
------------------
On 22 Mar 2011, Del Monte Fresh Produce NA, Inc. voluntarily recalled
4992 cartons of cantaloupes, because they have the potential to be
contaminated with _S._ Panama. The cantaloupes were distributed
through warehouse clubs in Alaska, California, Colorado, Idaho,
Montana, Oregon, and Washington.

The recalled products consist of cartons of cantaloupes, each
containing 4 plastic mesh sleeves with 3 cantaloupes per sleeve that
were available for sale between 10 Mar and 21 Mar 2011. The
cantaloupes, grown in and shipped from Del Monte Fresh's farm Asuncion
Mita in Guatemala, have a light brown color skin on the exterior with
orange flesh. The recalled cartons of cantaloupes are dark brown
cardboard with the "Del Monte" logo in red lettering and "cantaloupes"
in yellow lettering on a green background. The cantaloupes have the
lot codes: 02-15-24-10, 02-15-25-10, 02-15-26-10, and 02-15-28-10. No
illness has been linked to cantaloupes from other sources.

[Transmission of enteric pathogens such as _S._ Panama with a vehicle
such as a cantaloupe is related to the combination of the melon
growing on the ground and exposure to contaminated water used for
irrigation or to contaminated fertilizer. The edible pulp of the melon
is then contaminated by cutting through the exterior rind if adequate
washing of the outside is not done. - Mod.LL]
