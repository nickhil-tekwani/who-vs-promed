On 25 Oct 2005, the Brazilian Ministry of Health reported a new focus
of human rabies infections transmitted by blood-eating vampire bats
(_Desmodus rotundus_) in northeast Brazil [1]. 12 deaths were
reported in Turiacu, in the state of Maranhao in October 2005. Rabies
deaths have also been reported in 2005 in Godofredo Viana (3),
Candido Mendes (2) and Carutapera (2) [1], and the local media
reports that several hundred may have been bitten by bats. [4]. These
areas are in the north of Maranhao, next to the focus of a
bat-transmitted human rabies outbreak in the state of Para in 2004
[1,5]. During the recent outbreak, media reports noted that nocturnal
biting coincided with the failure of a regional generator which left
people without electricity for 6 weeks [4].
Between 1986 and 2004, the Ministry of Health was notified of 743
human rabies cases in Brazil, most of which occurred in the north and
northeast of the country [1]. Numbers of cases had been falling
steadily from 1980 (over 170 cases) to 2003 (under 20 cases), mainly
due to control of rabies in dog populations. Up to 2003, most human
rabies infections notified in Brazil were transmitted in an urban
setting by cats or dogs, but most infections since 2004 have been
transmitted by bats in rural parts of the states of Para and Maranhao
[1,5]. Outbreaks of bat-related rabies have been linked to the
continued deforestation of the Amazon region, which has displaced
vampire bats across northern Brazil and increased contact with humans
[2]. The Ministry of Health also notes that abandoned gold mines in
Maranhao have provided favourable habitats for bat populations [5].
Vaccination and bat-catching teams are working in the region to try
to prevent the spread of infection. A meeting between the authorities
from 2 states affected in 2004 and 2005 was held in October 2005 to
coordinate outbreak control activities.
Worldwide, rabies causes approximately 55 000 deaths per year [6].
Rabies viruses are transmitted to humans via saliva from bites of
carnivores and chiropterans (bats). Bats may be frugivorous
(fruit-eating), hematophagous (blood-eating), or insectivorous
(insect-eating). Transmission from carnivores has been controlled in
Europe by vaccination of domestic cats and dogs and oral vaccination
of wildlife. Vampire bats (_Desmodus rotundus_) feed on blood from
warm-blooded animals such as horses and cattle. They are not native
to Europe, and other species of bat found in Europe are not known to
be reservoirs of classical (genotype 1) rabies. Bats with rabies may
behave abnormally, which may partly explain the uncharacteristic
behaviour of human biting exhibited in the Brazilian outbreaks.
Current World Health Organization guidelines on rabies pre-exposure
prophylaxis state that rabies vaccine should be offered to visitors
travelling or living in areas where rabies is endemic. The vaccine is
given at 0, 7, and 21 or 28 days [7]. Following a bite or exposure of
mucous membrane to saliva, vigorous washing with soap, water and
application of ethanol or iodine to the wound is recommended to
decrease the risk of rabies transmission. For previously unvaccinated
people, the area surrounding the wound should be injected with rabies
immunoglobulin (RIG) as soon as possible after washing, followed by
intramuscular vaccination with 5 doses of inactivated cell culture or
duck embryo vaccine [8].
The extent of the outbreak in Brazil is not yet fully understood, and
therefore the risk to travellers is not completely defined.
Vaccination should be considered for travellers to the affected area
of the country, especially if they will be in remote areas for a long
time [9]. Such travellers should be informed of the need for prompt
treatment in the event of a rabies exposure. Sleeping in enclosed
areas protected by an intact building structure or screening and
netting should decrease exposure. Anyone returning from the Amazon
region with a possible animal bite should be immediately referred for
a specialist assessment regarding post-exposure prophylaxis.

[Hematophagous (vampire) bats (_Desmodus rotundus_) transmit
classical (genotype 1) rabies virus, hence standard rabies virus
vaccines (all derived from canine rabies virus) are effective in
providing pre- and post-exposure protection. These bats are not
present in Europe, but other species of bat found in Europe are
vectors for the 2 lyssavirus species, _European bat lyssavirus 1_ and
_European bat lyssavirus 2_, which are equally lethal for humans.
Fortunately, contact between bats carrying these viruses and humans
is rare, and the current genotype 1 rabies virus vaccine is
considered to be cross-protective. - Mod.CP]
