["As of 2020, RHDV2 has become established in wild lagomorphs in a number of European countries, Australia, and parts of Africa. In some locations, RHDV2 has largely replaced classical RHDV or RHDVa. Outbreaks have also been reported in New Zealand and some countries in the Middle East, Asia, and North America, but whether the virus will persist in some of these locations is not yet certain. In North America, this virus was found in both domestic and feral rabbits."

"There is no indication that any lagoviruses infect humans."

[In the 1980s, the European rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_) populations were devastated by a virus that caused an extremely lethal and highly contagious disease, rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD). The 1st outbreak of this new disease was reported in 1984 in the Jiangsu Province of China within a group of commercially bred Angora rabbits imported from Germany. As the virus spread worldwide, naturally occurring RHD outbreaks were reported in geographically distant regions, such as Cuba, Uruguay, and Reunion Island.

RHD is a highly virulent lagovirus endemic in Europe and Australasian populations of the European rabbit, _Oryctolagus cuniculus_. It has also caused several unexplained disease outbreaks in domestic European rabbits in North America.

RHD is characterised by high morbidity and high mortality (70-90%), and spreads very rapidly by direct and indirect transmission. Infection can occur by nasal, conjunctival, or oral routes.

Transmission of RHD is facilitated by the high stability of the virus in the environment. Lesions are primary liver necrosis and a massive disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in all organs and tissues. The most severe lesions are in the liver, trachea, and lungs.

RHD-2 is a variant form of the original RHD-1 virus and differs in the following ways:
- Rabbits infected with the RHD-2 virus typically do not show the symptoms that are common with RHD-1 infection, so it is far more difficult to diagnose from simple observations.
- Deaths from RHD-2 occur later and over a longer period of time than RHD-1: typically, this is 3-9 days following infection and can last up to 5 days, instead of 2-6 days infection and lasting 3-4 days as generally observed with classical RHD-1. Although this is marginal, it is important to note from a quarantine perspective.
- Only following post-mortem examination will initial diagnosis be possible; however, further tests are required to definitively confirm RHD-2, which is now recommended for unexplained deaths.
- In mainland Europe, RHD-2 is now very common, particularly in France, where it was first identified in 2010 and spread country-wide, mainly transmitted through the wild rabbit population with cross-over with domestic rabbits. In Italy it has not spread very wide given the differences in wild rabbit population density. A research study has been published that describes the proliferation in RHD-2 in France since 2010 and of relevance to the current situation in Great Britain and Ireland.

RHD-2 is genetically and antigenically different from RHD-1, and the immunogenic differences occur at the serotype level, for which vaccination against both variants is needed. - Mod.PMB
