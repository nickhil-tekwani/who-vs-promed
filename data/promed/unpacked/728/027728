New world screwworm (_Cochliomyia hominivorax_), Panama
-----------------------------------------------
Information received on 18 May 2012 from Dr Manuel Antonio Gonzalez Cano, Delegate, Direccion de Salud Animal, Ministerio de Desarrollo Agropecuario, Panama city, Panama

Summary

Epidemiology
Report type Immediate notification
Start date 11 Feb 2012
Date of 1st confirmation of the event 28 Apr 2012
Report date 18 May 2012
Date submitted to OIE 18 May 2012
Reason for notification Unexpected increase in morbidity or mortality of a listed disease

Summary description In Panama, new world screwworm (_Cochliomyia hominivorax_) is present in the province of Darien with 5 to 7 cases per year. During the 1st 5 months of 2012, 15 cases were observed.

Manifestation of disease Clinical disease
Causal agent Larvae of _Cochliomyia hominivorax_
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection - Unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments An epidemiological investigation was carried out on farms within a 5-km radius of the positive cases, with inspection of susceptible animals. Five percent coumaphos powder was distributed, to be applied to wounds, as well as collection tubes (alcohol 95 percent) for myiasis sample collection (6 tubes).

Movement control measures have been implemented through checkpoints (Torti, Panama and Agua Fria, Darien). All animals are being inspected and treated. Sterile flies have been released, and the dose for eradication is being maintained in the affected area (6000 flies/nautical mile).

[Overall, these problems seem to be similar to the ones that occurred in Panama or Chiapas, Mexico in 2003, a temporary increase due to a glitch in the eradication program. In the case of Chiapas, Mexico, we know there was a breakdown in the sterile fly technology, so that the flies were no longer firing blanks but in fact were breeding. After some technical adjustments, the program got back on track quickly, which is what I suspect will happen here. If the pressure is kept on the disease by movement control and effective release of sterile flies, this outbreak should be contained.

Surveillance is of the utmost importance, though, to insure that the increased incidence in Panama, and particularly the area near the Darien Gap, does not result in allowing the flies, which lay the screwworm eggs, to retake territories north of the Darien Gap. The Darien Gap has for many years been a key surveillance node monitoring foot and mouth disease in the region. Panama was declared free of active screwworm infestations in 2006.
