A chicken farm at Pat Heung was quarantined by the Agriculture, Fisheries
and Conservation Department last night after dead chickens tested positive
for bird flu. Inspections by AFCD staff found over 160 dead chickens at the
farm yesterday.
"As the test showed, the samples gave positive results for H5 virus in the
evening, the farm was immediately quarantined, and the farmer was stopped
from selling chickens," an AFCD spokesman said.
"Most of the remaining 50 000 chickens on the farm are housed in separate
sheds from the ones in which the dead chickens were found. These chickens
show no clinical symptoms of infection. We have decided to put these
chickens under close observation. Depending on our observation, we will
take appropriate measures to control the spread of the infection."
The farm last delivered chickens to the Cheung Sha Wan Temporary Wholesale
Poultry Market on 20 Dec 2002. That batch passed blood tests at the farm
and at the poultry wholesale market.
The AFCD inspected the farm on 28 Dec 2002 and no abnormal deaths were
found at that time. AFCD staff inspected 43 other chicken farms yesterday
but found no unusual deaths. Farms near the one quarantined will be placed
under close observation in the coming days.
"We remain on full alert and will take appropriate actions as and when
required," the spokesman said. On 28 Dec 2002, 16 000 chickens were
slaughtered on a chicken farm in the New Territories, and a wholesale
market was closed amid rising fears of a widespread bird flu outbreak.
The cull at the Ta Kwu Ling farm was ordered after more than 1000 chickens
died there. Tests on 12 chickens from the farm proved positive for the H5
virus.
Yuen Kwok-yung, professor of microbiology at the University of Hong Kong,
has warned that bird flu could spread with the onset of winter.
On 10 Dec 2002, Penfold Park in the centre of Sha Tin racecourse was closed
for a month after 31 ducks and geese died of the H5 virus in 2 weeks. A
week later 20 chickens were found dead at a market stall in Mui Wo.
