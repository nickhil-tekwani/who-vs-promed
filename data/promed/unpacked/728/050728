A World Health Organization (WHO) team visited a hospital on Friday [29 Jan 2021] where China says the 1st COVID-19 patients were treated more than a year ago as part of the experts' long-awaited fact-finding mission on the origins of the coronavirus.

The WHO team members and Chinese officials earlier had their 1st in-person meetings at a hotel ahead of field visits in and around the central city of Wuhan in the coming days.

"First face to face meeting with our colleagues. Correction: facemask to facemask given the medical restrictions," Dutch virologist Marion Koopmans tweeted in the morning.

She said they were discussing their program of visits and Chinese team leader "prof. Wannian" was joking about some technical glitches, an apparent reference to top Chinese epidemiologist Liang Wannian, who has been a leader of China's response team.

"Nice to see our colleagues after lengthy Zoom meetings," Koopman tweeted. The visiting researchers held video meetings during 14 days of quarantine after their arrival in China. They came out of quarantine on Thursday [28 Jan 2021].

Members of the team left the hotel by car, and a short time later entered the gates of the Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine. According to China's official account of its response to the initial outbreak, Dr. Zhang Jixian first reported cases of what was then known as "pneumonia of unknown origin" at the hospital on 27 Dec 2019.

WHO said earlier on Twitter that the team requested "detailed underlying data" and planned to speak with early responders and some of the 1st COVID-19 patients. It also planned to visit markets such as the Huanan Seafood Market linked to many of the 1st cases, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, and laboratories at facilities such as the Wuhan Center for Disease Control.

The team's mission has become politically charged, as China seeks to avoid blame for alleged missteps in its early response to the outbreak.

"All hypotheses are on the table as the team follows the science in their work to understand the origins of the COVID-19 virus," WHO tweeted.

Confirmation of the origins of the virus is likely to take years. Pinning down an outbreak's animal source typically requires exhaustive research including taking animal samples, genetic analysis and epidemiological studies.

One possibility is that a wildlife poacher might have passed the virus to traders who carried it to Wuhan. The Chinese government has promoted theories, with little evidence, that the outbreak might have started with imports of frozen seafood tainted with the virus, a notion roundly rejected by international scientists and agencies.

A possible focus for investigators is the virology institute in the city. One of China's top virus research labs, it built an archive of genetic information about bat coronaviruses after the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS.

The 1st clusters of COVID-19 were detected in Wuhan in late 2019. China has since reported more than 89 000 cases and 4600 deaths, with new cases largely concentrated in its frigid northeast, where local lockdowns and travel restrictions were being imposed to contain the outbreaks.

New cases of local transmission continue to fall, with just 36 announced on Friday [29 Jan 2021], as far fewer Chinese than usual appear willing to travel for Lunar New Year.

A World Health Organization-led team of experts investigating the origins of COVID-19 on Friday [29 Jan 2021] visited a hospital in the Chinese city of Wuhan that was one of the first to treat patients in the early days of the outbreak.

The hospital visit was the team's first in the field after 2 weeks in quarantine, and a WHO spokeswoman said the group's contacts in Wuhan will be limited to visits organised by their Chinese hosts due to health restrictions.

"The team will go out, but they will be bussed to wherever, so they won't have any contact with the community. They will only have contact with various individuals that are being organised as part of the study," WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris told a briefing in Geneva on Friday [29 Jan 2021].

After meeting with Chinese scientists earlier in the day, the team went to the Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine.

Zhang Jixian, director of the hospital's department of respiratory and critical care, has been cited by state media as the first to report the novel coronavirus, after treating an elderly couple in late 2019 whose CT scans showed differences from typical pneumonia.

"Extremely important 1st site visit. We are in the hospital that treated some of the first known cases of COVID-19, meeting with the actual clinicians & staff who did this work, having open discussion about the details of their work," Peter Daszak, a member of the WHO-led team, wrote on Twitter.

The team plans to visit labs, markets and hospitals during its remaining 2 weeks in Wuhan, where the coronavirus was first identified in late 2019.

While an exact itinerary has not been announced, the WHO has said the team plans to visit the seafood market at the centre of the early outbreak as well as the Wuhan Institute of Virology. One hypothesis, rejected by China, is that the outbreak was caused by a leak at the government lab.

The WHO-led probe in Wuhan has been plagued by delays, concern over access and bickering between China and the USA, which accused China of hiding the extent of the initial outbreak and criticised the terms of the visit, under which Chinese experts conducted the 1st phase of research.

The WHO has sought to manage expectations. "There are no guarantees of answers," its emergency chief, Mike Ryan, said this month [January 2021].

The investigating team had been set to arrive in Wuhan earlier in January [2021], and China's delay of their visit drew rare public criticism from the head of the WHO, which former US President Donald Trump accused of being "China-centric".

A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, said on Friday [29 Jan 2021] that WHO and Chinese experts were working together to trace the origin of the virus, but stressed that the mission was not a probe. "It is part of a global research, not an investigation," Zhao told a regular news conference in Beijing.

China has pushed the idea that the virus existed abroad before it was discovered in Wuhan, with state media citing the presence of the virus on imported frozen food packaging and scientific papers saying it had been circulating in Europe in 2019. China's foreign ministry has also hinted that the sudden closure of a US army laboratory at Fort Detrick in Maryland in July 2019 was linked to the pandemic.

"At the early stage in China, it was a burden particularly for Wuhan people when everyone was calling it a Wuhan virus, which was humiliating," said [YY], a 30-year-old Wuhan resident. "If it could be traced to the source clearly, in my opinion, it could clear either China's or Wuhan's name."

[One of the aspects of "infection source" to be addressed in relation to the 2 mentioned research/diagnostic laboratories in Wuhan is expected to be their biosafety (biosecurity) requirements and performance, underlining critical issues such as handling of waste and of used experimental animals.

In this respect, ProMED's rapporteur Dan Silver has delivered to us the document "Biosecurity Law of the P.R.C." (adopted at the 22nd Meeting of the Standing Committee of the 13th National People's Congress, 17 Oct 2020), for which he is gratefully acknowledged. The new law, translated by "China Law Translate," includes 10 chapters, of which chapter V follows.

Chapter V: Biological Security in Pathogenic Microbiology Laboratories
----------------------------------------------------------------------
"Article 42: The state is to strengthen biosecurity management of pathogenic microbiology labs and draft uniform standards for laboratory biological security. Pathogenic microbiology laboratories shall meet the national standards and requirements on biological security.

"Engagement in experiments of pathogenic microbes shall strictly follow relevant national standards, laboratory technical regulations, and operational procedures, and shall employ safety and prevention measures.

"Article 43: Categorical management is to be implemented for pathogenic microbes, based on the contagiousness of the pathogenic microbes and the extent of harm they do to infected people and animals as individuals or populations.

"Those engaged in the collection, storage, or transport of highly pathogenic microbes or suspected highly pathogenic microbes shall have corresponding capacity meeting biological security management specifications. The specific measures are to be formulated by State Council departments for health and rural affairs.

"Article 44: Approvals shall be obtained or filings completed in accordance with law, for setting up pathogenic microbiology laboratories.

"Individuals must not set up pathogenic microbiology laboratories or engage in pathogenic microbiology laboratory activities.

"Article 45: Hierarchic management is to be carried out for pathogenic microbiology laboratories, based on the pathogenic microbiology laboratories' biological security protection levels.

"Engagement in experimental activities on pathogenic microorganisms shall be carried out in laboratories of corresponding levels. Low-level pathogenic microorganism laboratories must not engage in pathogenic microbiology experimental activities that must be carried out in high-level pathogenic microorganism laboratories as provided by the national pathogenic microorganism catalog.

"Article 46: High-level laboratories engaging in laboratory activities with highly pathogenic, or suspected highly pathogenic, microbes shall be approved by the department of health or rural affairs of a provincial-level people's governments, and report on the experimental activities to the approving department.

"Experimental activities with pathogenic microbes that have not yet been discovered in our country or that have been announced as eradicated must not be conducted without approvals.

"Article 47: Pathogenic microbiology laboratories shall employ measures to strengthen the management of experimental animals and prevent their escape, making it so that experimental animals can be traced; and follow state provisions to dispose of experimental animals after use in a manner that renders them harmless and that allows for tracing of experimental animals. It is forbidden to introduce animals used in experimentation into the marketplace.

"Pathogenic microbiology laboratories shall strengthen the management of waste from experimental activities, lawfully disposing of waste fluids, gases, and other wastes and employing measures to prevent contamination.

"Article 48: The units setting up pathogenic microbiology laboratories are responsible for managing the laboratories' biological security by formulating scientific and strict management systems, periodically conducting reviews of the implementation of related biosecurity rules, and reviewing and updating the laboratories' facilities, equipment, and materials, to ensure they meet state standards.

"The legal representative and responsible person for units setting up pathogenic microbiology laboratories have responsibility for biological security in the laboratory.

"Article 49: The units setting up pathogenic microbiology laboratories shall establish and improve security and defense systems by employing measures to safeguard the security of the laboratory and its pathogenic microbes.

"The state is to strengthen the security and defense of higher-level pathogenic microbiology laboratories. Higher-level pathogenic microbiology laboratories shall accept oversight and guidance from the public security organs and other departments on laboratory security and defense work, to strictly prevent leaks, loss, and theft or robbery of highly pathogenic microbes.

"The state is to establish systems for personnel review at higher-level pathogenic microbiology laboratories. Entry of personnel into higher-level pathogenic microbiology laboratories shall be approved by the person responsible for the laboratory. Where it might impact laboratory biosecurity, it should be approved; and those that are approved to enter shall employ security protection measures.

"Article 50: The units setting up pathogenic microbiology laboratories shall draft emergency response plans for biological security incidents, and periodically organize personnel in carrying out training and emergency response drills. Where biological security risks such as leaks, loss, and theft or robbery of highly pathogenic microbes occur, control measures shall be promptly employed in accordance with the emergency response plan and reported in accordance with state provisions.

"Article 51: The provincial-level people's governments where pathogenic microbiology laboratories are located, and their departments for health, shall strengthen allocation of infectious disease resources for the laboratories' regions, to increase the ability to treat infectious diseases.

"Article 52: Enterprises are to conduct biosecurity management of production workshops involved with operations on pathogenic microbiology in accordance with provisions related to pathogenic microbiology laboratories and other biosecurity management specifications.

"The construction and management of biosecurity laboratories involved with biotoxins, plant pests, and other biological elements are to be implemented with reference to the provisions on pathogenic microbiology laboratories."

The handling of the law by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC) was accomplished after undergoing 3 readings ("deliberations"), starting October 2019, finalized during the 3rd and final NPCSC session on 17 Oct 2020. See the 3 subjects -- Legislative Plans, Texts & Legislative History, and Legislative Records -- at https://npcobserver.com/legislation/biosecurity-law/, and "explanation" (21 Oct 2020) at http://www.npc.gov.cn/npc/c30834/202010/a2d515b5158c4216b9e1d83038b5c820.shtml.

Subscribers are encouraged to visit the full text (10 chapters) of the translated law, available at https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/biosecurity-law/#_Toc53906404.

As presented in "Chapter I: General Provisions," Article 2, the law applies to engagement in any of the following activities:

(1) the prevention and control of major emergent infectious diseases, and outbreaks in animals and plants;
(2) security in biotechnology research, development, and applications;
(3) biological security management in pathogenic microbiology laboratories;
(4) the management of security in human genetic resources and biological resources;
(5) preventing encroachment by foreign species and the preservation of biodiversity;
