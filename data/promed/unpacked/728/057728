Hemorrhagic fever deaths after eating contaminated meat
-------------------------------------------------------
The director-general of health of Nineveh, on Mon 5 May 2010, announced
that the deaths of 4 people in Mosul during the past 2 days were due to a
"haemorrhagic fever" as a result of eating contaminated meat.

Dr Salah al-Din told the Voices of Iraq Agency that 4 people "had died in
the past 2 days after contracting a haemorrhagic fever that has spread in
Mosul", indicating that a virus had been contracted from contaminated red
meat slaughtered in an unhealthy way.

He reported that the Mosul Health Department "had closed a number of shops
selling meat in the Jerusalem district (Mosul east), the area where the
victims resided which had sold meat slaughtered in an unhealthy way". He
stated that the Health Department "had sprayed the butcher's shop and the
homes of the victims with pesticide [disinfectant?]."

[It was announced that] the burial of the dead with the disease "should be
deep enough underground for fear of transmission of the virus". The people
of Mosul were warned only "to purchase red meat from licensed premises and
to avoid purchasing meat from street vendors for their own safety."

Mosul is the capital city of Ninawa (Nineveh) province, situated 405 km
[252 miles] north of Baghdad.

A total of 4 people have died and another 3 are under observation in the
Al-Salam Hospital in Mosul, suspected to have contracted a viral
haemorrhagic fever. An employee of a hospital [stated] that 7 patients
suffering from a viral haemorrhagic fever had been admitted to the
emergency department of the hospital on 29 Apr 2010. The employee said that
4 of these 7 affected people had died in hospital and the 3 others remained
in isolation.

The employee explained that the hospital administration had closed the
emergency department of the hospital for 3 days and only reopened it after
thorough disinfection. The source added that all the victims had purchased
meat from a private butcher who had not slaughtered animals in an abattoir
inspected by the Health Department [perhaps "had slaughtered animals in an
abattoir not inspected..." - Mod.SH].

The source stated that the patients exhibit symptoms compatible with viral
haemorrhagic fever, with extensive bleeding that resulted in death within
36 hours of exposure.

[Viral haemorrhagic fevers contracted from exposure to raw meat are likely
to be caused by either Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) or
Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV). CCHFV is endemic in the region and the
favoured candidate for this outbreak in northern Iraq. In 2009 an outbreak
of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever was recorded among abattoir works in
neighbouring Iran.

Rift Valley fever has never been recorded as far north as Mosul. The only
previous outbreaks of Rift Valley fever outside of the African continent
occurred in the south of Saudi Arabia and in Yemen. Currently the only
known cases of Rift Valley fever are occurring in South Africa. Further
information is awaited.
