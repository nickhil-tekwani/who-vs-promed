[On March 30, this report was posted as an MMWR Dispatch on the MMWR
website (<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr>).]
In the United States, since 2001, an average of 265 mumps cases (range:
231--293 cases) have been reported each year, and in Iowa, an average of 5
cases have been reported annually since 1996. However, in 2006, by March
28, a total of 219 mumps cases had been reported in Iowa (illustrated by a
figure in the original text), and an additional 14 persons with clinically
compatible symptoms were being investigated in 3 neighboring states (11 in
Illinois, 2 in Nebraska, and one in Minnesota) in what has become the
largest epidemic of mumps in the United States since 1988 (1). This report
summarizes and characterizes the ongoing mumps epidemic in Iowa, the public
health response, and recommendations for preventing further transmission.
Mumps is an acute viral infection characterized by fever and nonsuppurative
swelling of the salivary glands; an estimated 20-30 percent of cases are
asymptomatic. Complications can include inflammation of the testicles or
ovaries, meningitis/encephalitis, spontaneous abortion, and deafness.
During the prevaccine era, nearly everyone in the United States experienced
mumps, and 90 percent of cases occurred among children aged less than 15
years. In 1977, Iowa law mandated one dose of measles, mumps, and rubella
(MMR) vaccine for entry to public schools; in 1991, the mandate became 2
doses. For the 2004-05 school year, 97 percent of children entering school
in Iowa had received 2 doses of MMR vaccine (2).
The first reports to the Iowa Department of Public Health (IDPH) of
mumps-like illness occurred in December 2005 at a university in eastern
Iowa, where several students with glandular swelling were tested, 2 of whom
tested positive for mumps-specific IgM antibodies. In mid-January 2006, an
isolate from an unrelated patient was cultured and identified as mumps
virus at the University Hygienic Laboratory (Iowa's state public health
laboratory). Viral isolates were sent to CDC, and the mumps strain was
identified as genotype G. By mid-February, active surveillance had been
initiated in 7 geographic areas, including the campuses of the 3 largest
universities in Iowa.
Of the 219 cases reported in Iowa, the median patient age was 21 years
(range: 3-85 years), with 48 percent of patients aged 17-25 years
(illustrated by a figure in the original report); 30 percent (34 of 114)
were known to be college students. Of the 133 patients with investigated
vaccine history, 87 (65 percent) had documentation of receiving 2 doses, 19
(14 percent) one dose, and 8 (6 percent) no doses; vaccine status could not
be documented in 19 (14 percent) patients. Among the 114 patients for whom
symptomatic information was available, the most common symptoms were
parotitis in 94 (83 percent) patients, submaxillary/sublingual gland
swelling in 46 (40 percent), fever in 41 (36 percent), and sore throat in
36 (32 percent); average duration of illness was 5.1 days. Six (5 percent)
patients reported complications (e.g., orchitis); one suspected case of
encephalitis is being investigated. As of 28 Mar 2006, investigators had
determined that only 36 (16 percent) of the 219 cases were linked
epidemiologically (i.e., a source of infection was identified), suggesting
frequent unapparent transmission.
The source of the Iowa epidemic is unknown; however, the United Kingdom
(UK) experienced a recent mumps epidemic that peaked during 2005 with
approximately 56 000 cases and a high attack rate among young adults (3).
The mumps strain in the UK epidemic also was identified as genotype G (4),
and the UK epidemic has been linked to a 2005 mumps outbreak in the United
States (5).
To educate health-care professionals in Iowa regarding the epidemic and
mumps, information has been distributed via Iowa's Health Alert Network
(HAN), in weekly electronic newsletters, and via frequent conference calls.
The IDPH website has provided biweekly updates, county case counts, fact
sheets, and guidance to local health departments and health-care facilities
on case investigations. IDPH recommendations include 1) requesting at least
5 days of isolation for all patients (quarantine is not being used), 2)
ensuring that students and staff members on all Iowa college campuses have
had 2 doses of MMR or are immune from mumps (6), 3) assessing vaccination
status of all health-care professionals in Iowa and offering vaccination
where appropriate (7), and 4) sending all specimens collected from possible
cases to University Hygienic Laboratory for testing.
Despite control efforts and a highly vaccinated population, this epidemic
has spread across Iowa and potentially to neighboring states. Ongoing
investigations will focus on identifying actual vaccine coverage on college
campuses, potential modes of mumps transmission, and the effectiveness of 1
or 2 doses of MMR.
