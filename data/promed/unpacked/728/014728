A 3rd case positive for [a] hantavirus fever was confirmed by authorities of the Ministry of Health (MINSA) in Los Santos province.

This case concerns a 61-year-old patient, from the El Bebedero community in Tonosí, who is currently is in the emergency unit of the Joaquín Pablo Franco Hospital in Las Tablas.

Carlos Muñoz, a Los Santos MINSA epidemiologist, stated that the patient became ill on [12 May 2017], but it was just this past [Wed 17 May 2017] that tests confirmed the case [as a hantavirus infection].

Muñoz stated that the patient is in stable condition and the results of laboratory tests are awaited.

In 2016 there were 5 cases of hantavirus fever and in 2015 there was a total of 20 cases.

[Fortunately, the affected woman is in stable condition. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) can develop quickly and has a case fatality rate of around 30 percent. This report does not give any details about the circumstances that led to the infection, nor specifies the hantavirus involved in this case. As noted in comments on previous cases, Los Santos and adjoining provinces are endemic for Choclo hantavirus. Although no data on this or the previous cases in earlier years include an indication of which hantavirus is responsible, Choclo is the only 1 of the 3 hantaviruses known to be endemic in Panama that causes HPS.

In the report above, no mention is made of the ecological setting in which the infection occurred. The croplands and food sources of the area, such as stored grain, attract the rodent host of Choclo virus. The preventive measures indicated in this and previous reports include elimination of sites attractive to rodents. No vaccine is available for Choclo virus.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents occur in and around agricultural areas and adjacent houses and buildings.
