In 2012, 2824 new cases of hantavirus disease were reported in Germany, the highest number ever in a single year. In the current issue of Deutsches Aerzteblatt International, Detlev Kruger and coauthors present the main facts about this disease (Dtsch Arztebl Int 2013; 110[27-28]: 461-7).

Every 2-3 years, large outbreaks of hantavirus disease are caused by Puumala virus, which is transmitted by bank voles [_Myodes glareolus_] and is endemic to south western and western Germany. In the north and east of the country, hantavirus infections are caused by the Dobrava-Belgrad virus, which is transmitted by striped field mice [_Apodemus flavicollis_ and A. agrarius_ are both reservoirs].

The manifestations that typically arise over the course of hantavirus disease come in several phases. The 1st sign is often an otherwise unexplained high fever; this may be followed by shock, renal failure, and pulmonary failure, depending on the severity of the disease. Thus, whenever persons living in high-risk areas present with fever of unknown origin or renal failure of unknown origin, physicians should consider the possibility of a hantavirus infection. Once the suspicion of hantavirus disease has been raised, special techniques can be used for precise viral diagnostic evaluation.

[The Puumala virus (PUUV) outbreaks are related to increases in the bank vole population. The vole population increases are due in large part to increases in beech tree mast (tree seeds) abundance, with PUUV outbreaks occurring a year after peak mast production. Bank voles are widely distributed across Europe.
