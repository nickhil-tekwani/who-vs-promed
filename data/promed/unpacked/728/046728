The Ministry of Health Jalisco (SSJ) has reported 9 confirmed cases of
poisoning by clenbuterol in the city of Zapotlanejo, and there are still 5
more [likely] to be confirmed. The outbreak occurred on Monday [12 Jan
2009], and the affected people were taken to a hospital in Guadalajara;
after receiving treatment, they are in good health.

The director of the Health Regulatory SSJ, Juan Carlos Olivares Galvez,
said this morning [17 Jan 2009] that the outbreak occurred in the butchery
"The Aztec" in Zapotlanejo, which was immediately closed down. It also
reiterated that the health alert for clenbuterol remains in effect in the
state, which continues the ban on the sale and purchase of beef liver.

In 2008, there was an outbreak of poisoning in 21 people from the town of
Tlajomulco de Zuniga.

Clenbuterol is a toxic substance and is not allowed for use in feed for
fattening cattle because it can cause severe damage to consumers or even death.

[Clenbuterol is a beta 2 adrenergic agonist drug with some anabolic
effects. It appears to redirect metabolism from fat to muscle. The drug is
approved for veterinary use as a bronchodilator in horses. In humans, it is
used as a weight loss drug. When the drug is used in animals and humans
ingest liver or muscle containing the drug, they may experience an increase
in heart rate, nervousness, headache, muscular tremor, dizziness, nausea,
vomiting, fever, and chills, typically resolving within 2 to 6 days. As a
result of such consequences in humans, the United States and Europe
actively monitor urine and tissue samples from livestock for the presence
of clenbuterol.

Since the metropolitan area is involved in tracing the animals, it would
appear that Mexico has some tracking system for clenbuterol as well.

Of note, a similar incident occurred in Hong Kong in 1998 involving 9
people eating pork lungs found to have concentrations of clenbuterol
ranging between one and 24 micrograms per kilogram (See: Pork,
contaminated, clenbuterol - China (Hong Kong) 19980505.0876). - Mod.TG]
