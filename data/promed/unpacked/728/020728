Four imported cases of Chikungunya (CHIK) virus infection have been
identified among Canadians travelling to offshore islands in the
Indian Ocean of East Africa. The 4 Canadian cases were from Quebec
(1), Ontario (2), and Alberta (1) and their travel history included
visits to the island of Reunion, Mauritius, and the Seychelles
Islands during the month of February. Patients presented with a
history of fever, rash, and ongoing arthralgias which are symptoms
typical of CHIK infection.
Serological testing (hemagglutination inhibition) confirmed the
presence of CHIK antibody in the patients' sera. Serum samples were
forwarded to the National Microbiology Laboratory (Winnipeg,
Manitoba) by the Montreal General Hospital - McGill University Centre
for Tropical Diseases, the Ontario Ministry of Health & Long Term
Care Laboratories Branch, and the Provincial Laboratory of Public
Health for Southern Alberta.

[ProMED is most grateful for such first-hand information from Dr.
Mike Drebot. Imported cases of CHIK have been documented, outside the
endemic Indian Ocean basin, in Europe (France, Switzerland, Germany
and Belgium), Far-eastern Asia (China), and now North America
(Canada). - Mod.RY]
