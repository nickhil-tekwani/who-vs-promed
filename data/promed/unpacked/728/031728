The appearance of 3 cases of visceral leishmaniasis in less than a
month has begun to raise fear among the population of Santo Tome.
There is panic among the residents; the authorities began to perceive
a change in preventive habits after years of resistance to accepting
the magnitude of this serious disease.

So far this year [2010], Santo Tome is the only town in the province
of Corrientes that has reported cases, and all cases of leishmaniasis
reported have been the visceral type.

The director of the San Juan Bautista Hospital, Pedro Moratorio,
said: "The atmosphere in the city is calm, but there is a significant
behavioral change in people after the appearance of the 3 cases.
Cleaning and maintenance of courtyards of the houses is being
achieved with the collaboration of the municipality," he said.
Another behavior that began to change in the city is the attitude
toward dogs. "People working in controls now complain for the
municipality to act when they see a stray dog with symptoms.

The owner of the hospital said that since he encountered the 1st case
of leishmaniasis in an infant during January 2010 that he maintains a
permanent contact with minister Julian Dindart, who is responsible
for epidemiology and reports on the situation in the locality.

Next week, a team is expected from the Ministry of Health, which will
develop a diagnosis, ascertain the local situation and make contact
with neighbors.
