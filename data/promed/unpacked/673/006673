A Vietnamese exchange student has been arrested by police in Japan for illegally carrying fermented pork rolls containing the African swine fever [ASF] virus into the country. Hac Thi Phuong Linh, 23, is being held at a police station in Tokyo for violating the quarantine law, her family said.

Vietnamese newspaper VnExpress reported that she was caught at Haneda International Airport on 13 Jun 2019 trying to bring in 10 kg of the pork rolls (nem chua) and 360 fetal duck eggs into Japan without declaring them. Both items require quarantining before entry into Japan.

After testing, Japanese authorities revealed that the pork rolls contained the virus that causes ASF. This is the 1st case of pork containing the virus caught in Japan.

Tokyo Broadcasting System Television has reported that Ms Linh told the police that the pork rolls were made by her mother for personal use, but the police suspected they were for selling to others. During the interrogation, she admitted that she was planning to sell the rolls online.

After ASF broke out in Viet Nam last February [2019], several countries, including Japan, imposed a ban on pork products from the country.

Passengers carrying raw or processed foods to Japan from Viet Nam must have a certificate of safety, failing which they face 3 years imprisonment or a fine of one million yen (USD 9413.00).

[Food products of pig origin from ASF-infected territories may become sources of infection for domestic pigs or wild boar in the target countries. This will take place in case they are fed to local susceptible animals purposely (e.g. included in swill) or incidentally.

The fact that ASF is not pathogenic to humans should not lead to neglecting the prescribed elementary requirements to prevent the wide-scale and rapid dissemination of the disease. Recycling of ASF infected/suspected-as-infected material, including pork and its products, and uncontrolled movement of feed and fomites, such as shoes, clothes, vehicles, equipment, and packing material, are, due to the high resistance of ASF virus in the environment, potential sources for its spread.

Viet Nam has notified to the OIE a total of 6082 outbreaks in 62 administrative divisions since the 1st occurrence of the disease in the country (1 Feb 2019). None of these outbreaks have been reported as resolved. Clusters of up to 447 outbreaks have been reported in the country. - Mod.AS
