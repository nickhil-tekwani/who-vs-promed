Yellow fever has reached the Northern coast of São Paulo [state], Brazil, where 2 dead monkeys were infected with the disease. One of the monkeys was found in a forest area in Ubatuba, and the other in a gated community in Juquehy, São Sebastião. The 2 cities have intensified their vaccination campaign.

There is also one human case under investigation in Ubatuba, a patient who died on [Mon 2 Apr 2018] with symptoms of the disease, in Ubatumirim, Northern area of the city, in Serra do Mar State Park.

A howler monkey was also found dead in the area at the end of March [2018]. Lab results confirmed it was infected with yellow fever.

After the results were published, the local government issued an alert reporting only 47 percent of the city's population have been vaccinated.

In order to change this situation, the city has established additional health centers for vaccination inside a grocery store and on the boardwalk downtown. It has also extended working hours at some units.

In São Sebastião, health agents have been inspecting houses in Juquehy beach. The area was identified as the probable infection location of a marmoset found dead early this year.

According to the City Department of health, the monkey was a pet. It belonged to a family from São Paulo that was spending some time at beach with the animal.

Since July 2017, Brazil has registered 1131 cases of the disease, according to the Ministry of Health.

[Yellow fever cases continue to increase, albeit slowly, including expansion in the major metropolitan municipalities such as in São Paulo state. There is no indication that the outbreak has ended. Although there still have been no reports of cases from the urban, _Aedes aegypti_, cycle of transmission the risk remains that spillover from the sylvan (forest) cycle could occur. The death of the pet monkey is of particular concern, if that animal was housed in a location where _A. aegypti_ mosquitoes were present. _A. aegypti_ vector mosquitoes are present in the state and are responsible for the transmission of dengue, Zika, and chikungunya viruses. There is risk of new human cases and outbreaks in other areas, so that surveillance is important. Expansion of the area for vaccination to include the areas mentioned above is prudent. - Mod.TY
