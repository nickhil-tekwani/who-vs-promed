Viroid Prevalence in Tunisian Citrus
--------------------------------
A. Najar, Institut de la Recherche Agronomique de Tunisie, Tunis,
Tunisia; and N. Duran-Vila, Instituto Valenciano de Investigaciones
Agrarias, Moncada (Valencia), Spain. Plant Dis. 88:1286, 2004;
published on-line as D-2004-0915-01N, 2004. Accepted for publication
8 Aug 2004.
The citrus industry in Tunisia is based mainly on the production of
local cultivars of sweet orange (_Citrus sinensis_), common mandarin
(_C. reticulata_), clementine (_C. clementina_), and lemon (_C.
limon_). Sour orange (_C. aurantium_) is the only rootstock presently
being used in the major growing area located at Cap Bon, where 80
percent of citrus is being produced.
The presence of tristeza disease in the Mediterranean basin is a
threat to the Tunisian citrus industry, and new rootstocks giving
tristeza tolerant rootstock/scion combinations are urgently needed as
an alternative to sour orange. Since some promising rootstocks are
known to be sensitive to viroids (1), a survey was conducted to
determine whether the cultivars grown presently in Tunisia were
infected with viroids.
Following a preliminary report (2), an extensive survey was conducted
from 1995-2001 that included 174 symptomless sources being grown at
Cap Bon: 26 Maltaise demi-sanguine, 9 Maltaise sanguine, 20 Maltaise
blonde, 4 orange double-fine, 16 Washington navel, 12 Valencia late,
29 common mandarin, 42 Cassar clementine, 5 Lunari lemon, and 11
Eureka lemon. These sources were graft-inoculated into Etrog citron
which subsequently developed symptoms characteristic of viroid
infection.
Sequential polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis and molecular
hybridization using viroid-specific probes (1) revealed that all
sources were infected with at least 2 viroids. Citrus exocortis
viroid (CEVd), Hop stunt viroid (HSVd), and Citrus viroid III
(CVd-III) were widespread and accounted for 68.4, 67.8, and 81.0
percent of the sources tested, respectively.
Citrus bent leaf viroid (CBLVd) and Citrus viroid IV (CVd-IV) were
only found in 32.7 and 2.3 percent of the sources.
The most frequent viroid combinations were CEVd+HSVd+CVd-III (17.8
percent) and CEVd+CVd-III (17.2 percent), whereas HSVd+CVd-IV and
CEVd+CBLVd+CVd-III+CVd-IV were found in a single source (0.6 percent).

[There is not much information specifically relevant to the Tunisian
citrus industry, but I have provided 2 links below. On a worldwide
basis, there are at least 6 citrus viroids: Citrus exocortis viroid
(CEVd), Citrus bent leaf viroid (CBLVd), Hop stunt viroid (HSVd),
Citrus viroid III (CVd-III), Citrus viroid IV and Citrus viroid-OS
(CVd-OS). CEVd causes the bark-scaling citrus exocortis disease on
trifoliate orange (_Poncirus trifoliata_) [Pt] root stocks, and some
HSVd variants cause citrus cachexia disease in sensitive hosts such
as mandarins (_Citrus reticulata_). CEVd, HSVd, and CVd -III are
predominately found in introduced cultivars such as lemons and
oranges, while CVd-OS, HSVd, and CVd-III are frequently found in the
domestic cultivar 'Shiranui'. Other viroids induce different degrees
of stunting.
Since commercial citrus trees are commonly infected with viroid
mixtures, only limited information is available on their effects in
species other than Etrog citron. In general, yield reduction was
associated mainly with loss of production of large fruits.
Bark-cracking of Pt may be caused by CEVd, CVd-IV, and HSVd, but not
by CBLV d or CVd-III. The International Committee on Taxonomy of
Viruses (ICTV) has proposed the name Citrus dwarfing viroid (CDVd) as
a replacement for CVd-III. Disease management depends upon
sterilizing pruning shears with bleach before moving to the next
tree. Modern techniques for detection of viroids in citrus are
required as well, because viroid-infected plants are often
symptomless.
I decided to post this piece even though it covers only the period
1995-2001, because it is a good reference point for citrus viroids
worldwide. I assume that the status of citrus viroids in Tunisia has
not changed substantially since 2001. Perhaps our colleagues in
Tunisia and Spain can provide additional information.
