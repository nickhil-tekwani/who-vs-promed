From: Luiz Jacintho da Silva
Source: Media reports

Reports from Addis Ababa say that over 1500 children in 7 districts of
South Tigray have contracted polio. These reports are based on
announcements from the Labour and Social Affairs Department, Ato Hadis
Degefa department head. Over 450 mobile vaccine stations are being
deployed during November and December to inoculate children under 5 yearsof
age. Additionally, the health departments of East Wollega, Hadiya and
Arsi zones have mobilized for a vaccination drive which is planned to
encompass almost 800,000 children at both permanent and mobile stations.
And East Wollega districts have established committees to immunize. Most
of the cases in South Tigray have been found among poverty stricken and
street children.

[I sincerely hope that all the personnel carrying out the immunization
campaign, and any tourists to Ethiopia, get polio boosters before they go.
It is not generally appreciated that adults entering an outbreak area need
the extra protection of a booster, even if they were fully immunized as a
child. - Mod.JW]
