Exotic Newcastle Disease Confirmed in Texas; 5 Counties Quarantined in
Texas and New Mexico
Birds and poultry movement from 5 counties in Texas and New Mexico is being
prohibited after laboratory tests completed late Wednesday, 9 Apr 2003,
confirmed Exotic Newcastle Disease (END) had infected a backyard flock of
chickens last week near El Paso. As a preemptive measure, state and
federal animal health regulatory officials earlier this week destroyed the
flock, but are concerned that END, a highly contagious foreign-origin
virus, may have spread to other poultry and birds in the area.
El Paso County has been quarantined by the Texas Animal Health Commission
(TAHC), and the New Mexico Livestock Board has quarantined Luna, Dona Ana
and Otero Counties in New Mexico. By mid-afternoon Thursday, 10 Apr
2003, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is expected to place a
federal quarantine on these counties, in addition to Hudspeth County in Texas.
"As of Wednesday evening, infection has been confirmed only in El Paso
County," explained Dr. Bob Hillman, Texas state veterinarian and executive
director for the TAHC. "However, the 5 counties quarantined in Texas and
New Mexico are considered to be a trade area in which there is significant
movement of birds and poultry. State and federal authority is being
imposed so that disease surveillance, testing and diagnosis can be
conducted. It is customary for the USDA to quarantine additional counties,
in order to create a 'buffer zone' around an infected county. The END
outbreak must be stopped before it spreads to other backyard, hobbyist or
exhibition flocks, or to the commercial poultry industry."
Dr. Hillman explained that the USDA is providing fair market payment for
birds that must be destroyed during this disease outbreak. He stressed
that END does not affect human health, nor does it affect poultry products
or eggs.
"We are depending on bird and poultry owners to assist us in eradicating
this disease outbreak," said Dr. Steven England, state veterinarian for the
New Mexico Livestock Board. "Please report illness or unexpected death
losses to your private veterinary practitioner or to the TAHC or New Mexico
Livestock Board." The TAHC has a 24-hour hotline that can be reached at
1-800-550-8242, and the New Mexico Livestock Board can be called at (505)
841-6161.
END usually has a 2 to 15-day incubation period, and infected birds or
poultry may exhibit signs of respiratory distress, including gasping or
coughing. The virus also affects the central nervous system, causing
infected birds to become paralyzed, develop muscle tremors or twist their
necks. In some flocks, disease may strike quickly, and the only sign is
death loss.
"We are asking for full cooperation from bird and poultry owners. Do not
move birds from the quarantine area. Do not move birds within the area,
either," he said. "If at all possible, keep birds in isolation on your
premise, and ensure that no birds are introduced onto your property during
the quarantine period."
Dr. Hillman said that the quarantines will last until state and federal
animal health officials are certain all disease has been eradicated and
that it is safe to resume normal movement and activities.
"Take precautions," said Dr. Hillman. "Clean your boots prior to entering
bird pens. You could pick up contaminated manure on your footwear at the
feed store, at the coffee shop, or at your neighbor's place. Use bleach
and water or a commercial disinfectant to spray or dip your boots. Wear
clean clothes when working with the birds. Clothing, too, can pick up
viruses that can be transmitted to your birds."
"We can stop the spread of this disease, but only if we all work together
quickly and cooperatively. Report illness in your birds. Abide by the
quarantines. Practice good biosecurity," said Dr. England. "By addressing
this problem together, we can stop this disease before it has a chance to
become widespread in Texas or New Mexico."
