After routine sampling by the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture revealed
that some packages of sprouts produced by a Michigan company contained
_Listeria monocytogenes_ the company has recalled all packages distributed
in Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, Illinois and Wisconsin.
Affected in the recall are alfalfa sprouts, crunchy sprouts, gourmet
sprouts, spicy sprouts, radish sprouts, mustard-onion sprouts, dill sprouts
and clover sprouts. The products come in 4-ounce bags, trays or in bulk
form, and are sold under the brand names of "Garden of Eatin'" and "Living
Sprouts". The company is asking consumers to return them to stores for full
refunds. Consumers with questions can call the company at 616-455-8895.
_Listeria monocytogenes_ can cause serious and potentially fatal ailments
in children, frail and elderly people as well as those with weakened immune
systems. In healthy people, listeriosis may cause high fever, severe
headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea and miscarriages and stillbirths.
