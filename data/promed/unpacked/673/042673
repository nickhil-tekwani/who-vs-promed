Outbreak of _E. coli_ infections in 12 states
---------------------------------------------
The CDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the FDA are investigating a multistate outbreak of _E. coli_ O157:H7 infections.

Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by the CDC. DNA fingerprinting is performed on _E. coli_ bacteria isolated from ill people by using a standardized laboratory and data analysis method called whole-genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these sequences that are used to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives investigators detailed information about the bacteria causing illness. In this investigation, WGS showed that bacteria isolated from ill people were closely related genetically. This means that people in this outbreak are more likely to share a common source of infection.

As of 28 Oct 2020, a total of 23 people infected with the outbreak strain of _E. coli_ O157:H7 have been reported from 12 states.

Total / 23

Illnesses started on dates ranging from 17 Aug 2020 to 8 Oct 2020. Ill people range in age from 5 to 81 years, with a median age of 21 years; 67% of ill people are female. Of 15 ill people with information available, 10 hospitalizations have been reported, including 2 people who developed hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a type of kidney failure. No deaths have been reported. Illnesses might not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2 to 4 weeks.

Investigators are reviewing different types of data to identify the source of this outbreak.

State and local public health officials are interviewing ill people to determine what they ate and other exposures in the week before they got sick. People have reported eating a variety of foods, including leafy greens. Of the 13 people interviewed to date, all reported eating various types of leafy greens, like iceberg lettuce (9), romaine lettuce (8), mixed bag lettuce (6), and spinach (9).

This outbreak is caused by the same strain of _E. coli_ O157:H7 that caused an outbreak linked to romaine lettuce in 2019. However, food linked to a previous outbreak alone is not enough to prove a link in another outbreak of the same strain. This is because different foods can be contaminated by the same strain of bacteria.

Public health officials are continuing to interview ill people, and the FDA is conducting farm inspections, sampling, and traceback investigations. A specific food item has not yet been identified as the source of this outbreak. The CDC is not advising people avoid any particular food at this time.

The CDC will provide more information as it becomes available.
