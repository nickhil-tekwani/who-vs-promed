Summary and assessment as of 31 Mar 2015
-------------------------
Human infection with avian influenza A(H5) viruses
----------------------

From 2003 through 31 Mar 2015, 826 laboratory-confirmed human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection have been officially reported to WHO from 16 countries. Of these cases, 440 have died. Since the last WHO Influenza update on 3 Mar 2015, 42 new laboratory-confirmed human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection, including 11 fatal cases, were reported to WHO from Egypt (37), China (3) and Indonesia (2).

Of the 37 human cases of influenza A(H5N1) virus infection reported from Egypt, 14 had onset of disease in February 2015 and the rest had onset of disease in March 2015. The cases were reported from 14 different governorates of Egypt [see table 1 in the annex to the original source]. The age range of the 37 cases is from 1 to 77 years, with a median of 24 years and 38 percent of the cases are under 10 years of age. Almost twice as many females compared to males were affected. 8 of the 37 cases (22 percent) died and all 8 fatal cases were in patients 10 years of age and older. All but one case had exposure to poultry or poultry markets and the exposure history of the 1 case is still under investigation. All cases were hospitalized and all reportedly received treatment with antiviral medication. Contacts of the cases were followed for 14 days and there have not been reports of cases in any contacts of confirmed cases. The newly reported cases included 1 cluster of 2 confirmed cases in a mother and son from Sharkia governorate. The 2 cases had onset of illness on the same day and both had exposure to backyard poultry, suggesting common exposure.

Currently, there are reports of an increased number of outbreaks and detections of influenza A(H5N1) viruses in poultry in Egypt compared to previous months and compared to this month [April] in previous years.

Although all influenza viruses evolve over time, preliminary laboratory investigation has not detected major genetic changes in the limited number of viruses isolated from the patients and animals compared to previously circulating isolates thus far, but further in-depth analysis is ongoing. A new candidate vaccine virus was proposed to better protect against the current circulating H5 clade 2.2.1. viruses (a group which all the recent influenza A( H5N1) virus isolates from Egypt belong to. See http://www.who.int/influenza/vaccines/virus/201502_zoonotic_vaccinevirusupdate.pdf?ua=12).

For the 4th consecutive month since December 2014, the number of laboratory-confirmed human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection in Egypt with disease onset in each month are the highest numbers reported by any country in a single month. The characteristics of the affected population remain essentially unchanged from previous years in Egypt, with females more commonly affected than males and about 1/3 of the cases occurring in children under 10 years of age. The proportion of fatal cases has been consistently lower in Egypt than in other countries, especially in children, although the case fatality rate could change as many cases remain hospitalized.

The increase in the number of human cases is likely attributable to a mixture of factors, including increased circulation of influenza A(H5N1) viruses in poultry, an increasing number of small poultry farms and household flocks, lower public health awareness of risks and seasonal factors such as closer proximity to poultry because of cold weather and possible longer survival of the viruses in the environment.

China reported 3 human cases of infection with an avian influenza A(H5N1) virus from 2 provinces. 2 cases were reported to have had exposure to live poultry. 1 of the human cases was a fatal case while the other 2 cases were still under treatment at the time they were reported.

Indonesia reported 2 fatal human cases of infection with an avian influenza A(H5N1) virus, in a father and a son from Banten province. The investigation surrounding these 2 cases indicates that they may have had indirect or direct contact with birds near their residence or in another district they visited prior to their onsets of illnesses. Both cases developed severe disease and were hospitalized but passed away. The last human case of infection with an avian influenza A(H5N1) virus in Indonesia was reported in June 2014.

Various influenza A(H5) subtypes, such as influenza A(H5N1), A(H5N2), A(H5N3), A(H5N6) and A(H5N8), have recently been detected in birds in Asia, Europe, and North America, according to reports received by OIE. Although these influenza A(H5) viruses might have the potential to cause disease in humans, so far no human cases of infection have been reported, with exception of the human infections with influenza A(H5N1) viruses and the 3 human infections with influenza A(H5N6) virus detected in China since 2014.

Overall public health risk assessment for avian influenza A(H5) viruses: The cases reported from these 3 countries appear to be sporadic cases and the virus is known to be circulating endemically in poultry in these countries. Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, sporadic infections and small clusters of human cases are possible in people exposed to infected poultry or contaminated environments, therefore the additional sporadic human cases would not be unexpected.

Although an increased number of animal-to-human infections have been reported by Egypt over the past few months, these influenza A(H5) viruses do not currently appear to transmit easily among people. As such, the risk of community-level spread of these viruses remains to be low. Although the risk assessment remains unchanged, further studies are needed to understand the risk factors for human infections and the potential role of mild cases if they are occurring. Further analyses on virus isolates from the animal sector and human cases need to be undertaken to better understand if changes in the transmissibility of the virus from animals to humans may be playing a role in the current situation.

Human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses in China
------------------------

A total of 631 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus, including 253 deaths, have been reported to WHO. The majority of recently reported human cases are associated with exposure to infected live poultry or contaminated environments, including markets where live poultry are sold. A(H7N9) viruses continue to be detected in poultry and their environments in the areas where human cases are occurring. There have been no major genetic changes in the viruses isolated from recent patients compared to previously isolated viruses from humans. Information to date suggests that these viruses do not transmit easily from human to human.

Overall public health risk assessment for avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses:
Overall, the public health risk from avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses has not changed since the assessment of 23 Feb 2015. See http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/influenza_h7n9/Risk_Assessment/en/

[FluTrackers' count of H7N9 cases in China is significantly higher with a total of 656 since it was 1st noted in 2013 (https://flutrackers.com/forum/forum/china-h7n9-outbreak-tracking/143874-flutrackers-2013-15-human-case-list-of-provincial-ministry-of-health-government-confirmed-influenza-a-h7n9-cases-with-links). Similarly, discrepant numbers of cases have been reported for H5N1, but regardless, the 2 outbreaks (H5N1 and H7N9) are significant in their magnitude and duration. H5N1 in Egypt is now in its 5th month, and China is experiencing a 3rd wave of H7N9 cases since early Spring 2013. - Mod.LK]

Human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus - China
-----------------------
On 10 Apr 2015, the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) of China notified WHO of 20 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A (H7N9) virus, including 4 deaths.

Onset dates ranged from 14 Feb 2015 to 21 Mar 2015. Cases ranged in age from 32 to 80 years with a mean age of 55 years. Of these 20 cases, 15 (75 percent) were male. The majority (18 cases, 90 percent) reported exposure to live poultry. 1 case is a health care worker, who had also poultry exposure. No clusters were reported. Cases were reported from 5 provinces: Anhui (3), Fujian (2), Guangdong (4), Shandong (1), and Zhejiang (10).

The Chinese Government has taken the following surveillance and control measures
- Strengthen epidemiological and etiological monitoring and situation analysis;
- Strengthen case management and medical treatment;
- Provide information to the public and conduct risk communication with the public.

WHO is assessing the epidemiological situation and conducting further risk assessment based on the latest information. Overall, the public health risk from avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses has not changed. Comparing with the previous 2 months, the infection case number is decreasing and no new infected province has been reported. Further sporadic human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) infection are expected in affected and possibly neighboring areas. Should human cases from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during or after arrival. If this were to occur, community level spread is considered unlikely as the virus does not have the ability to transmit easily among humans.

WHO advice
--------
WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms, contact with animals in live bird markets, areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.

WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, in order to ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions.
