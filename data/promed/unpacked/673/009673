More than 50 suspected yellow fever deaths in the country
---------------------------------------------------------
Of the 250 suspected yellow fever cases, there are 51 deaths registered from 30 Dec 2015 to 11 Feb 2016 in the country [Angola], the National Director of Public Health (MINSA), Adelaide de Carvalho, stated in Luanda.

The information was provided in a conference called "cafe of ideas" with professionals of Social Communication, that had the objective to keep them informed, trained and active in the action developed for prevention and combat against yellow fever disease, within the activities plan to reinforce social communication and mobilization.

The speaker stated that the Viana municipality [Luanda province] is the most affected, with 92 yellow fever cases and 29 deaths, and also Huila province has 30 cases and 6 deaths.

She stated that in the past 24 hours, there were notifications of 33 more cases and 11 deaths, with Viana most affected with 8 cases and 6 funerals.

Additionally, she stated that in Luanda 451 266 people have been vaccinated of an anticipated total of 1 578 085 [to be vaccinated].

She said that the vaccine is the most effective preventive measure for yellow fever.

"We must be attentive to yellow fever symptoms, controlling high fever, chills, malaise, headache, vomiting and hemorrhage in the most serious cases," she said.

She appealed to society to protect themselves using screens in windows, to sleep under impregnated bed nets, use insecticides and avoid [providing] mosquito breeding [sites].

Yellow fever is a febrile hemorrhagic disease transmitted by bites of [virus] infected mosquitoes.

[It is good to see the vaccination campaign moving along quickly in the Luanda area. Curiously, no mention is made of vaccination activities in the other focus of infection, in Huila province. The Angola outbreak illustrates the need for diagnosis and rapid response as early as possible to minimize spread of the disease. Although 70 percent of the population reportedly has been vaccinated previously, obviously there are enough unvaccinated susceptible individuals to sustain ongoing transmission and spread. Pre-outbreak contingency plans need to be in place to facilitate swift reaction when the 1st cases appear.
