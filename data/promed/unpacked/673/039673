An outbreak of cryptosporidium infections occurred among employees at a
large private company in Denmark in late August 2005. The outbreak was
reported to the food safety authorities by the company management on 2 Sep
2005, following the onset of diarrhoea among a large number of employees
during that week (week 35). To investigate the cause of diarrhoea, people
with symptoms were urged to submit faecal samples for examination, and a
case-control study was initiated. The faecal samples tested negative for
diarrhoea-causing viruses and bacteria, but 13 of 17 patients were found by
microscopy to be infected with Cryptosporidium.
The parasite was subsequently typed as _Cryptosporidium hominis_ by PCR.
Results of the case-control study indicated that disease was associated
with eating in the company canteen in the 1st part of the previous week
(week 34). Eating food from the salad bar in the canteen was also
associated with disease. A 2nd questionnaire-study was conducted during
week 39. This was conducted as a cohort study using an electronic form
distributed by email to all employees of the company, and contained
questions about the individual food items available from the salad bar.
A total of 364 out of about 600 employees of the company participated in
the 2nd study. Of these, 78 met the case definition (diarrhoea with onset
after 20 Aug 2005). Disease was associated with eating in the company
canteen on Monday (relative risk [RR]: 4.1, 95 percent confidence intervals
[CI]: 2.2-7.6) or Tuesday (RR: 4.4, 95 percent CI: 2.2-8.8) in week 34, and
eating from the salad bar on those days (RR: 3.1, 95 percent CI: 2.0-4.8
and RR: 3.1, 95 percent CI: 2.0-4.7, respectively).
An analysis of questionnaire responses from people who reported eating from
the salad bar found that 2 food items in particular were associated with
disease: whole peeled carrots (RR: 2.4, 95 percent CI: 1.5-4.0) and grated
carrots (RR: 2.0, 95 percent CI: 1.2-3.5). In a multivariate analysis, only
these 2 food items were associated with disease. The whole carrots were
considered to be a probable vehicle for infection, as they were kept in a
large bowl with water. One hypothesis is that employees using the canteen
may have taken carrots from the bowl using their hands, and that this
action could have contaminated the carrots if any of these people were
human carriers of the parasite. There was no evidence to suggest that the
carrots were contaminated by the kitchen staff. As a consequence of the
outbreak, the canteen management has announced that raw vegetables will no
longer be served in water.
A total of 99 people reported onset of diarrhoea after 20 Aug 2005. Only
2/3 of the individuals assumed to have been exposed to canteen food during
the relevant time period participated in the studies, and so the actual
number of infected patients may have been higher.
Outbreaks of cryptosporidium infections are uncommon in Denmark. The only
previous report was a hospital-associated outbreak in 1989, where the
likely source of the outbreak was an ice cube machine contaminated by a
patient excreting the parasite [1]. In Denmark, cryptosporidium infections
are not notifiable and faecal samples from patients with gastrointestinal
symptoms are not always examined for parasites. Therefore, a reliable
estimate of the incidence is not available. However, based on the number of
positive samples reported from the diagnostic laboratory at Statens Serum
Institut, the infection is believed to be relatively rare compared with
other gastrointestinal infections.

[Infections with cryptosporidia have been extensively reported from the
United Kingdom (see below). The prevalence -- at least of symptomatic
infections -- is low in humans in Scandinavia. However, the present report
shows there are probably carriers who can serve as source of infection
given the opportunity. Serving raw carrots in a bowl of water is common
practice, but apparently carries a small risk if people serve the carrots
with their fingers.
The investigation of cases and controls by questionnaire or interview shows
the strength of these methods for identifying the source of infection. -
