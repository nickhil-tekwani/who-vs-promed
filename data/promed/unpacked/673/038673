Johor Health and Environment, Education and Information committee chairman Datuk Ayub Rahmat said the 3 were among 128 who came down with foodborne illness after consuming seafood at the party. "The 3 have been hospitalized but the others were given outpatient treatment and sent back. The initial investigation showed that mussels could have been the cause of the poisoning, " he said. "Samples from the food and water served, as well as swabs from the food handlers and the kitchen equipment, were sent to the Johor Baru Public Health Laboratory for analysis on [Mon 20 Nov 2017]" he said.

[In order to speculate on the causal agent (or agents) of this outbreak, it is important to know what symptoms were present in those affected -- that is, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea or any other symptoms (especially neurological) as well as the incubation period from ingestion of the alleged vehicle and the development of symptoms. In addition to the possibility that "garden variety" staphylococcal enterotoxin (short incubation period, primarily vomiting without fever) or salmonellosis or _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ infection (longer incubation period, primarily diarrhea with fever) for examples which might be associated with foods other than the mussels; shellfish can be linked to several other relatively short incubation illnesses including norovirus and 2 of the so-called shellfish poisoning diseases, diarrheal (or diarrhetic) shellfish poisoning and neurotoxic shellfish poisoning. ProMED-mail would appreciate more information about this outbreak.

Diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) [1] is an acute gastrointestinal illness caused by consumption of bivalve molluscs that have accumulated okadaic acid (OA) or related dinophysistoxins through the mollusks' use of filter feeding. Symptoms include nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, chills, and fever with an incubation period of 30 minutes to 4 hours after consumption of contaminated food, and symptoms last up to 72 hours; treatment is supportive. The symptoms are quite similar to norovirus disease.

Neurotoxic shellfish poisoning (NSP) [2] is caused by consumption of molluscan shellfish contaminated with brevetoxins. Brevetoxins are neurotoxins which activate voltage-sensitive sodium channels causing sodium influx and nerve membrane depolarization. No fatalities have been reported, but hospitalizations occur. NSP involves a cluster of gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms: nausea and vomiting, paresthesias of the mouth, lips and tongue as well as distal paresthesias, ataxia, slurred speech and dizziness. Neurological symptoms can progress to partial paralysis; respiratory distress has been recorded.

Muar (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muar_(town)) is a historical town and the capital of Muar District, Johor, Malaysia. It is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Malaysia and explored for its food, coffee and historical buildings from the pre-war period. An alternative name to it is Bandar Maharani. A map of its location in southern Malaysia can be found at this URL.
