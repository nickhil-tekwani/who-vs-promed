_Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 3_ (GLRaV-3) is a destructive virus and the only cure is to pull out infected vines. In 1995, we first reported the natural spread of GLRaV-3 in Australia. Since then, we have been looking for a natural insect vector for this virus.

For the 1st time, we have now identified that grapevine scale (_Parthenolecanium persicae_) can transmit GLRaV-3 to healthy vines under greenhouse conditions. In Europe, a different species, _P. corni_, is known to transmit both the related _Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 1_ (GLRaV-1) and _Grapevine virus A_ (GVA).

It is interesting that our infected vines were also infected with GVA, as well as with GLRaV-3, and that the _P. persicae_ crawlers could transmit both viruses at the same time. This is the 1st report of _P. persicae_ as a vector of these viruses.

[Grapevine leafroll is one of the most important viral diseases in grapevines and occurs wherever grapevines are grown. At least 9 different grapevine leafroll-associated viruses (GLRaVs) belonging to different genera within the family _Closteroviridae_ have been reported. Typical leafroll symptoms include downward rolling and interveinal reddening or yellowing of leaves, as well as reduced fruit size, sugar content, and yield. Several species of mealy bugs and soft scales (families _Pseudococcidae_ and _Coccidae_, respectively) have been reported as vectors for GLRaV 3. Similar vectors are thought to be involved in the spread of some of the other GLRaVs. All of the GLRaVs are also spread by grafting and have been widely distributed and accumulated in their long-lived host over time by human activities.

Symptoms of viral leafroll disease vary on different grape varieties resulting in very serious disease in some varieties and no symptoms at all in others. These latter 'latent' infections are a particular threat as a source of diseased grafting material. Generic molecular diagnostic methods for _Closteroviridae_ have been developed and can be used to ensure virus-free rootstocks and budwood.

_Grapevine virus A_ (GVA; genus _Vitivirus_) and other vitiviruses are spread by similar vectors as well as infected planting material and grafting. Members in the genus are implicated as causal agents of the grapevine rugose wood disease complex. An estimated yield loss of over 20 per cent has been attributed to GVA, depending on grape cultivar and location, even in asymptomatic infections. In some leafroll affected table grape cultivars, it may lead to decline and death of plants.

Disease management of grapevine viruses may include vector control and phytosanitation, such as removal of infected plants and disinfection of vineyard tools. Use of certified virus free planting material (including tissue cultures, rootstocks and scions for grafting) is essential.
