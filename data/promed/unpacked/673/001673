Epizootic ulcerative syndrome, Malawi
-------------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 24 Jul 2020 from Dr Patrick Chikungwa, Director of Department of Animal Health and Livestock Development, Department of Animal Health and Livestock Development, Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Water Development, Lilongwe, Malawi

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 16 Jun 2020
Date of confirmation of the event: 17 Jul 2020
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence of a listed disease in the country
Causal agent: _Aphanomyces invadans_
Nature of diagnosis: clinical: suspicion, clinical, laboratory (basic), necropsy
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Bua river, Mlonyeni EPA [extension planning area], Mchinji, Central
Date of start of the outbreak: 16 Jun 2020
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: river system
Water type: fresh water
Population type: wild
Production system: open
Total animals affected:
Species / Morbidity / Mortality / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Cat fish (_Clarias gariepinus_) / 3 (scale 0 to 5) / / 3 (scale 0 to 5) / 1000 / 5 / 5 / 0 / 0
Affected population: The affected fish are mostly from the Bua river and a connecting river with other ponds constructed by farmers in the swampy areas that drain the rivers. Most affected are _Clarias_ species and some _Oreochromis shiranus_ [Note: _Tilapia shiranus_ https://www.fishbase.se/summary/1432 (common names). - Mod.CRD] and _Tilapia_ spp.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]:
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Cat fish (_Clarias gariepinus_) / 50 / 50 / 100 / 50
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: contact with infected neighboring establishment, fomites (humans, vehicle, feed, etc.), horizontal spread through water
Epidemiological comments: There are fishing activities done in these rivers with use of different fishing gears from different sources. A lot of small-scale fish farming done in the swampy areas are close to the rivers and farmers might have illegally sourced fingerlings from infected zones within the neighboring establishments across the borders. Preliminary analysis was done at Central Veterinary Laboratory and samples have been sent to the University of Zambia for molecular analysis.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; surveillance outside infected and/or protection zone; surveillance within infected and/or protection zone; emergency harvest; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: quarantine; disinfection; process to inactivate the pathogenic agent in products or by-products

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Central Veterinary Laboratory (national laboratory) / Cat fish (_Clarias gariepinus_) / microscopic examination/ 17 Jul 2020 / Positive
University of Zambia (ACEIDHA) (regional reference laboratory) / Cat fish (_Clarias gariepinus_) / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / - / Pending

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

["Infection with _Aphanomyces invadans_ is a seasonal epizootic condition of great importance in wild and farmed freshwater and estuarine fish. It has a complex infectious aetiology and is clinically characterised by the presence of invasive _A. invadans_ infection and necrotising ulcerative lesions, typically leading to a granulomatous response. Infection with _A. invadansis_ most commonly known as epizootic ulcerative syndrome (EUS). It is also known as red spot disease (RSD), mycotic granulomatosis (MG), and ulcerative mycosis (UM). In 2005, scientists proposed that the disease should be named epizootic granulomatous aphanomycosis; however, the term EUS continues to be used by most scientists.

"The disease is caused by the oomycete fungus _A. invadans_. Infection with _A. invadans_ has spread widely since the first outbreak in 1971 in Japan and to date only one genotype has been recorded. Parasites and rhabdoviruses have also been associated with particular outbreaks, and secondary Gram-negative bacteria invariably infect lesions caused by _A. invadans_.

"The genus _Aphanomyces_ is a member of a group of organisms commonly known as the water moulds. Although long regarded as a fungus because of its characteristic filamentous growth, this group, the Oomycetida, is not a member of the Eumycota but is classified with diatoms and brown algae in a group called the Stramenopiles or Chromista.

"Infection with _A. invadans_ was first reported in farmed freshwater ayu (_Plecoglossus altivelis_) in Oita Prefecture, Kyushu Island, Japan in 1971. It was later reported in estuarine fish, particularly grey mullet (_Mugil cephalus_) in eastern Australia in 1972. Infection with _A. invadans_ has extended its range through Papua New Guinea into South-East and South Asia, and into West Asia, where it has reached Pakistan. Outbreaks of ulcerative disease in menhaden (_Brevoortia tyrannus_) in the United States of America (USA) had the same aetiological agent as the disease observed in Asia. The first confirmed outbreaks of infection with _A. invadans_ on the African continent occurred in 2007 in Botswana, Namibia, and Zambia, and were connected to the Zambezi-Chobe river system. In 2010 and 2011, infection with _A. invadans_ appeared in wild freshwater fish in Western Cape Province, South Africa, and in wild brown bullhead fish in Lake Ontario in the Province of Ontario, Canada. Infection with _A. invadans_ has been reported from more than 20 countries in four continents: North America, Southern Africa, Asia, and Australia.
