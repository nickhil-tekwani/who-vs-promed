Nigerian health officials reported 4 confirmed monkeypox cases through [28 Feb 2022]. The cases were reported from FCT, Imo, Adamawa and Lagos states.

No deaths were reported.

Since September 2017, Nigeria has continued to report sporadic cases of monkeypox (525).

A total of 8 deaths have been recorded (CFR = 3.5%) in 6 states namely Edo (2), Lagos (2), Imo (1), Cross River (1), FCT (1) and Rivers (1) from September 2017 to 28 Feb 2022.

Monkeypox is a rare disease caused by infection with monkeypox virus. Monkeypox occurs throughout Central and West Africa, often near tropical rain forests.

People become infected with the monkeypox virus through contact with the bodily fluids of infected animals or humans (alive or dead), including respiratory droplets, or through contact with materials contaminated with the virus.

Symptoms include fever (â‰¥ 100.4 deg F [38.6 deg C]), headache, muscle aches, and swollen lymph nodes, followed by a rash. Patients are usually ill for 2-4 weeks. Monkeypox is fatal in as many as 1 to 10% of people who become infected. Prior vaccination against smallpox may provide protection against monkeypox.

[As noted in the comment in a previous ProMED post (Monkeypox - Africa (01): Nigeria 20220112.8700812), monkeypox virus continues to be transmitted to people in Nigeria. The sporadic monkeypox (MPX) cases have been widely distributed in Nigeria. In 2019, cases occurred in 9 states. From September 2017 to November 2019, with 9 deaths in 183 cases, the CFR (case fatality rate) was 5%. Nigeria has been a source of MPX cases that have been imported into other countries, most recently into the UK (see Monkeypox - UK: ex Nigeria 20191206.6827532) and Singapore (see Monkeypox - Singapore ex Nigeria 20190511.6464598).

There is no mention in the above report how many of the MPX cases were acquired from wildlife hosts or how many were due to contact with infected people. Prevention of MPX virus infections will not be possible without knowing the source of infection and locality where they occurred. The question remains about the source of these recent infections. Monkeys are not the reservoirs of the virus, despite the name that the virus has received. Studies of prevalence of MPX virus in populations of rodent hosts are not mentioned in this or in previous reports. The main reservoirs of MPX virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp., an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_. Halting the bushmeat trade and consumption of wild animals to halt MPX virus exposure will be culturally and economically difficult, so continued occurrence of cases can be expected. A vaccine that is expected to be effective against MPX has been developed recently, but deciding where to mount a campaign in this broad geographic area would be a challenge.

The MPX virus clade involved in these and previous cases is not mentioned. As noted in previous ProMED posts, the monkeypox virus clade in the Congo Basin causes more severe disease in humans -- with a case fatality rate of 10-17% -- than the clade in Ghana, which causes few fatalities. The reported case fatality rate in Nigeria is comparatively low. - Mod.TY
