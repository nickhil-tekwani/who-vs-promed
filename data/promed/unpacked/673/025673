Dr Gardner Murray, Australian Chief Veterinary Officer, asked me to post the
following update to OIE on events relating to the current outbreak of
Newcastle disease in New South Wales, Australia.

Dear Dr Blancou
Newcastle Disease in New South Wales
Further to my report of 21 September, I wish to provide the following
additional information.
Destruction of all geese, ratites and pullets on the first affected property
has been completed and feral pigeons have been euthanased. Destruction of
remaining layer hens is well advanced.
A traceforward of poultry from the first affected farm has indicated the
involvement of a third small (2500 birds) broiler farm at Rylstone, which is
130 km north-west of the two quarantined farms. This third farm has been
place in quarantine and veterinary authorities in New South Wales have
pre-emptively destroyed all poultry in advance of confirmation of infection.
The farm is isolated and there are no other
poultry farms in the area.
The following disease control measures have been implemented by government
veterinary authorities in New South Wales (NSW):
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
* imposition of quarantine on the three affected farms and imposition of
restrictions on the movement of poultry, birds and poultry products;
* declaration of an infected zone ('restricted area') of approximately 3 km
around infected farms;
* declaration of a surveillance zone ('control area') of more than 10 km
around the infected farms;
* intensive surveillance and tracing of live birds and products derived
from the affected farms.
Diagnostic results
------------------
Further investigations have confirmed the virulence of the isolated virus:
Intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI)
* virus from infected farm 1 was 1.6
* virus from infected farm 2 was 1.9
Pathology
---------
Pathological examination shows lesions consistent with a neurotrophic virus.
Gene sequencing studies
-----------------------
Gene sequencing studies are continuing, but results to date indicate that
the NDV isolates from the first and second infected farms are the same
virus. Laboratory investigations are continuing but comparative studies
against other Australian lentogenic isolates and some overseas strains in
the genebank suggest that the outbreak strain may have evolved as a mutation
from an endemic strain.
The disease has been regionalised according to the principles established by
OIE. Therefore no restrictions have been placed on the movement of poultry
or poultry products within Australia, except from the surveillance zone
around the infected farm, ie the rest of Australia should be recognised as a
virulent Newcastle Disease-free zone.
There is close consultation with and good cooperation from the poultry
industries, fancy birds and racing pigeon organisations.
Up-to-date factual information is available on the world wide web at
http://www.agric.nsw.gov.au/news/nd/
I shall keep you informed of further developments.
Yours sincerely
GARDNER MURRAY

Geographical identification
Farms 1 and 2: 33*440' south, 151*0' east, near Sydney, NSW.
Farm 3: 32*58' south, 149*0' east, near Sydney, NSW.
Details concerning the outbreak
Farm No. Species No. of animals
1 Avian 76 000 layers
9000 pullets
10 geese
Ratites 4 ostrich
wild pigeons: many (unknown number)

2. Avian 12 000 layers
3. Avian 2 500 broilers
Comments concerning affected population
---------------------------------------
* These farms supply eggs and meat to the domestic market in the Sydney
metropolitan area;
* No birds, poultry or products have been exported from these properties;
* No poultry have been processed in an export abattoir.
Comments on the epidemiology
----------------------------
Mortalities were first investigated on the 6 August 1998. The disease
picture on this farm was confused due to the fact that there was active
Marek's disease also present. The first evidence of Newcastle Disease virus
was test results from sera collected on 26 August 1998, which was tested
retrospectively when Newcastle Disease was included in the differential
diagnoses on 10 September 1998.
A traceforward from the first infected farm has indicated a further
dangerous contact premise at Rylstone. The 2500 broilers are being destroyed
today (24 September 1998).
It does not appear to be rapidly spreading. Samples from feral pigeons on
the farm have indicated acute infection.
There is no evidence of infection elsewhere in Australia.
Control measures taken to date
------------------------------
* The first two farms were officially placed in quarantine on 17 and 18
September 1998 respectively. The third farm at Rylstone, was placed in
quarantine on 22 September and poultry destroyed on 23September;
* A surveillance zone has been imposed around the infected zones;
* A comprehensive surveillance program has been instituted;
* The birds on the infected farms are being slaughtered and the property
disinfected.
[Intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) is calculated by using eight
chicks at least 24 hours old but not more than 40 hours old which are
innoculated intracerebrally with a 24-26-gauge needle. Each should receive
0.1ml of undiluted innoculum. The chicks are then housed together in an
isolator and observed daily until death or for 8 days. The survival index is
based on time of death and is calculated by scoring each chick daily for 8
days (0, normal; 1, diseased; 2, dead). The resulting sum is divided by the
number of observations. Velogenic viscerotropic strains are scored in range
of 1.5 to 2.0; these strains had indices of 1.6 & 1.9 - Mod.MHJ
