Anthrax in animals in India is not taken very seriously, maybe we have more
important diseases to worry about. We had previously the Rinderpest (the
"aetiology" of OIE itself). Now we have the problem of FMD [Foot-&-mouth
disease rampant, the HS [Haemorrhagic septicaemia, and a less important
BQ [Black quarter. So the vaccinations are done periodically usually for
FMD & HS.
Anthrax, although endemic all over India, vaccination on mass scale is
seldom resorted. The sporadic incidence could be another reason for its
improper compliance. Occasional death of elephants from Anthrax is reported
in elephants. Incidentally elephants are good grazers also contrary to MHJ's
view.

Jacob V. Cheeran
Indian member of the OIE Working Group on Wildlife Diseases
[Michael Woodford commented: "I agree with him that elephants (both Africa
and Indian) often graze rather more than one thinks." Which must increase
the risk of elephants acquiring anthrax above that of pure-browsers. While
open to the accusation of seeing anthrax where others don't, a common
experience is that the disease is regularly under-reported. We regularly
find that a rancher or farmer has had a series of livestock deaths before
anthrax is diagnosed; in sheep this can involve greater than 50 deaths
before a diagnosis is attempted. And in India the disease is unevenly
distributed with the eastern (alkaline) side having the large majority of
cases. What can then be high local incidences, if divided by the national
livestock denominator, makes them statistically "sporadic". And if
"endemic" (vide supra) it is not sporadic. I don't argue about the greater
importance of FMD, except that with modern vaccines it can be readily,
rapidly, and efficiently eradicated, as in South America. MHJ
