[1] WHO update
Date: Thu 29 Nov 2018

http://www.who.int/news-room/detail/29-11-2018-measles-cases-spike-globally-due-to-gaps-in-vaccination-coverage


Reported measles cases spiked in 2017, as multiple countries experienced severe and protracted outbreaks of the disease. This is according to a new report published today [29 Nov 2018] by leading health organizations. Because of gaps in vaccination coverage, measles outbreaks occurred in all regions, while there were an estimated 110 000 deaths related to the disease.

Using updated disease modelling data, the report provides the most comprehensive estimates of measles trends over the past 17 years. It shows that since 2000, more than 21 million lives have been saved through measles immunizations. However, reported cases increased by more than 30% worldwide from 2016. The Americas, the eastern Mediterranean region, and Europe experienced the greatest upsurges of cases in 2017, with the Western Pacific the only World Health Organization (WHO) region where measles incidence decreased.

"The resurgence of measles is of serious concern, with extended outbreaks occurring across regions, and particularly in countries that had achieved, or were close to achieving, measles elimination," said Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, Deputy Director General for Programmes at WHO. "Without urgent efforts to increase vaccination coverage and identify populations with unacceptable levels of underimmunized or unimmunized children, we risk losing decades of progress in protecting children and communities against this devastating, but entirely preventable, disease."

Measles is a serious and highly contagious disease. It can cause debilitating or fatal complications, including encephalitis (an infection that leads to swelling of the brain), severe diarrhoea and dehydration, pneumonia, ear infections, and permanent vision loss. Babies and young children with malnutrition and weak immune systems are particularly vulnerable to complications and death.

The disease is preventable through 2 doses of a safe and effective vaccine. For several years, however, global coverage with the 1st dose of measles vaccine has stalled at 85%. This is far short of the 95% needed to prevent outbreaks, and leaves many people, in many communities, susceptible to the disease. The 2nd dose coverage stands at 67%.

"The increase in measles cases is deeply concerning, but not surprising," said Dr. Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. "Complacency about the disease and the spread of falsehoods about the vaccine in Europe, a collapsing health system in Venezuela, and pockets of fragility and low immunization coverage in Africa are combining to bring about a global resurgence of measles after years of progress. Existing strategies need to change: More effort needs to go into increasing routine immunization coverage and strengthening health systems. Otherwise we will continue chasing one outbreak after another."

Responding to the recent outbreaks, health agencies are calling for sustained investment in immunization systems, alongside efforts to strengthen routine vaccination services. These efforts must focus especially on reaching the poorest, most marginalized communities, including people affected by conflict and displacement.

The agencies also call for actions to build broad-based public support for immunizations, while tackling misinformation and hesitancy around vaccines where these exist. "Sustained investments are needed to strengthen immunization service delivery and to use every opportunity for delivering vaccines to those who need them," said Dr. Robert Linkins, Branch Chief of Accelerated Disease Control and Vaccine Preventable Disease Surveillance at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Measles and Rubella Initiative Management Team Chair. The Measles and Rubella Initiative is a partnership formed in 2001 of the American Red Cross, CDC, the United Nations Foundation, UNICEF, and WHO.

Note to editors
"Progress toward regional measles elimination -- worldwide, 2000-2017" is a joint publication of WHO and the CDC. It is published within the WHO Weekly Epidemiological Record and in CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.

Launched in 2001, the Measles and Rubella Initiative (M&RI) is led by the American Red Cross, the United Nations Foundation, CDC, UNICEF and WHO. M&RI is committed to ensuring that no child dies from measles or is born with congenital rubella syndrome, and achieving the Global Vaccine Action Plan goal of measles and rubella elimination in at least 5 WHO regions by 2020.

Measles elimination is defined as the absence of endemic measles virus transmission in a region or other defined geographical area for more than 12 months. Conversely, a country is no longer considered to be free of measles if the virus returns and transmission is sustained continuously for more than one year.

Further information
The report is available in CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report as of 29 Nov 2018 and in WHO's Weekly Epidemiological Record from 30 Nov 2018. Further information on immunization progress is also contained within the 2018 Assessment Report of The Global Vaccine Action Plan by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization, published in November 2018.

[2] Ukraine: Ukrainian health officials reported an additional 2138 measles cases in the past week, up 15% from the previous week
Date: Wed 28 Nov 2018
Source: Outbreak News Today [edited]
http://outbreaknewstoday.com/ukraine-reports-another-2000-measles-cases-past-week-annual-total-tops-42000/


During the week ending 24 Nov 2018, 729 adults and 1409 children were confirmed to have measles. Since the beginning of 2018, the Center for Public Health of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine has reported 42 040 measles cases (15 864 adults and 26 176 children). Of this total, 15 people have died.

Lviv has reported the most cases with 8835, followed by Ivano-Frankivsk (4297), Transcarpathian (3979) and the Odessa region (2623). In the capital of Kyiv, 2556 cases were reported.

Health officials continue to encourage immunization; in fact, they call it a matter of national security, as the health of Ukrainians -- all together and everyone in particular -- depends on the level of vaccination coverage in the country. As of 1 Nov 2018, the number of children who received the 1st dose of the MMR [measles, mumps, and rubella] vaccine was 76.1%, and the percentage receiving 2 doses of MMR was 77.5%. In each region of Ukraine there are sufficiently high-quality and effective vaccines for planned and enhanced immunization.

[3] Philippines (Malapatan, Sarangani)
Date: Tue 27 Nov 2018
Source: Manila Standard [edited]
http://manilastandard.net/news/national/281584/22-die-in-suspected-measles-outbreak.html


Health authorities are trying to determine whether the deaths of at least 22 people in Malapatan, Sarangani have been caused by measles. An informed source said the regional health unit had sent blood samples to the main office of the Department of Health in Manila to confirm whether the victims, who have displayed symptoms of measles, in fact, died of measles. Reports said approximately 200 patients had displayed symptoms of measles.

Data from the World Health Organization showed that cases of measles had decreased by 84% from 2000 to 2016.

On Monday [26 Nov 2018], local health officials in Sarangani said at least 17 children were reported to have died in several remote communities in the Sarangani town of Malapatan during the past 3 weeks due to a suspected measles outbreak. Dr. Diomedes Remitar, Malapatan Municipal Health Office chief, said the victims, who included infants, reportedly died several days after exhibiting severe symptoms of measles infection. Remitar said the suspected outbreak was monitored in Sitios Lower and Upper Kyogam, Mahayag, Lino, Datal Nai and Alna of Barangay Upper Suyan.

Based on information relayed by Barangay health workers and officials of Barangay Upper Suyan, the Municipal Health Office chief said the affected villages -- among the remotest areas in the town -- are inhabited by the B'laan tribe. "These are considered suspected measles cases as we have not conducted confirmatory tests on the fatalities," he said. The health officer suspected that some of the reported fatalities could have suffered from diseases other than measles.

As of Mon [26 Nov 2018], at least 23 people from Barangay Upper Suyan are confined at the R.O. Diagan Hospital after earlier showing symptoms of suspected measles, such high fever, skin rashes, conjunctivitis, and other flulike illnesses. Hospital records showed 15 of the patients, which included a 4-month-old baby and a 7-month-pregnant mother, had confirmed measles infection and were currently under isolation in at least 3 rooms.

Boyet Ogan, chairman of Barangay Upper Suyan, said around 100 people, mostly infants and children, were affected by the outbreak. Ogan said the initial measles cases were monitored in one of the sub-villages last 5 Nov 2018 and rapidly spread to the other areas.

As part of their interventions, Remitar said they had vaccinated around 500 infants and children in the area against measles. He said their office has provided medicines and treatment to some of the affected residents. "It's quite difficult to access the affected communities due to their remoteness and the problematic roads," he said. Remitar added that they also had difficulty getting proper information, as it requires a hike of at least 20 hours to reach the areas.

http://outbreaknewstoday.com/new-zealand-second-case-measles-confirmed-south-island-19801/


The Southern District Health Board (DHB) in New Zealand is reporting a 2nd confirmed case of measles in Marlborough, which is believed linked to the case reported last week in Milford Sound. The woman in her 20s has been in isolation in Marlborough since Tuesday [20 Nov 2018], and public health officials say it is unlikely she would have infected anyone. "The patient was in isolation during the period of infectivity and we are reasonably confident that she would not have passed the virus on to anyone else in that time," says Dr. Susan Jack, Southern DHB, Medical Officer of Health.

A 30-year-old Milford Sound resident was confirmed as having measles last week. Another close contact of the pair, a man in Te Anau, is also suspected of having the illness and has also been in isolation since the initial measles case was diagnosed last Tuesday [13 Nov 2018]. None of the 3 patients are thought to have had the measles vaccine.

Public health agencies from all the South Island DHBs are working together to manage the outbreak and were on the alert for measles cases, Dr. Jack said.

A 10-year-old boy, a resident of the Shomron Chareidi community of Emanuel, has been admitted to Schneider Children's Hospital in Petach Tikvah, listed in very serious condition as a result of contracting measles. Doctors report the measles led to a very serious brain infection.

The child was never vaccinated and has been placed in isolation in the hospital. It appears he caught the illness from friends in his class, and they are now being checked by doctors to determine if they too have the illness.

Chief of Infectious Diseases at Schneider, Prof. Itzik Levi, told Ynet that the child has a most serious infection involving his brain, and the prognosis is that he will not make a total recovery because of the extent of the current infection, and is likely to be left with neurological impairment. Dr. Levi is quoted saying, "We see the destructive consequences of not being vaccinated, and I call upon everyone to have their children vaccinated."

YWN previously reported on a 3-week-old baby in Bnei Brak hospitalized with the measles, caught from his mother who was unvaccinated. Earlier this month, an 18-month-old girl died from measles in Meah Shearim.

The number of measles cases related to Lakewood has climbed to 18, with another 16 possible occurrences under investigation, according to an update from the Ocean County Health Department. According to the New Jersey Department of Health, the 3 newest cases developed when a person who had already been confirmed with measles in Lakewood visited family in Passaic while infectious. The 3 newest cases are from the same household.

The cases all stem from a 27-year-old Lakewood man who had traveled to Israel and was confirmed to have the measles at the end of October [2018]. The literal rash of Lakewood cases is one of several outbreaks in the New York area, including Brooklyn and Rockland County. The New York City Health Department reported 29 confirmed cases in Brooklyn since October [2018], while 80 cases were confirmed in Rockland County by its county health department.

[The Ocean County Health Department continues to support and highly encourage the exclusion of nonvaccinated children from schools, preschools and daycare centers in the outbreak area. These entities have the authority to make that decision when an outbreak has been declared by the New Jersey Department of Health. The age range so far for the current outbreak is 6 months to 27 years.

Meanwhile, Central Hatzolah (covering all 5 boroughs of New York City) sent a letter to all their members informing them that they are required to show proof that they have been vaccinated. The letter in part reads:

"In light of the recent measles outbreak in several areas of New York City, the Executive Board, in consultation with the Department of Health and several infectious disease specialists, has made a determination regarding immunization requirements for all Hatzalah members.

"In order to protect our members, their families, and the community that we serve, every member will be required to provide proof of immunity for the following diseases: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, [and] hepatitis B."
