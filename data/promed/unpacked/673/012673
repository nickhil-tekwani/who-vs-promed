Vulvar Vaccinia Infection After Sexual Contact with a Military
Smallpox Vaccinee -- Alaska, 2006
-----------------------------------------------
On 10 Oct 2006, an otherwise healthy woman visited a public health
clinic in Alaska after vaginal tears that she had 1st experienced 10
days before became increasingly painful. The patient reported having
a new male sex partner during the period 22 Sep to 1 Oct 2006. A
viral swab specimen from a labial lesion of the woman was submitted
to the Alaska State Virology Laboratory (ASVL) for viral culture. The
viral isolate could not be identified initially and subsequently was
sent to CDC on 9 Jan 2007, where the isolate was identified as a
vaccine-strain vaccinia virus. After vaccinia was identified,
investigators interviewed the woman more closely and learned that her
new sex partner was a male U.S. military service member stationed at
a local military base. Further investigation determined that the
service member had been vaccinated for smallpox 3 days before
beginning his relationship with the woman. This report describes the
clinical evaluation of the woman and laboratory testing performed to
identify the isolate. Health-care providers should be aware of the
possibility of vaccinia infection in persons with clinically
compatible genital lesions who have had recent contact with smallpox vaccinees.
Clinical Description
------------------
At the public health clinic on 10 Oct 2006, the woman told
health-care providers that her partner consistently wore condoms
during sex; however, a condom broke during vaginal intercourse on 1
Oct 2006. The 2 had no further contact after 1 Oct 2006. The patient
told health-care providers she did not recall seeing penile ulcers or
other unusual skin lesions on her partner. She had no history of
genital ulcers or sexually transmitted infections and said that her
vaginal tears did not result from sexual violence or abuse. She
reported testing negative for human immunodeficiency virus
approximately 3 months earlier. She had no fever, itching, or dysuria.
Clinical examination revealed 2 shallow ulcerations, one measuring 5
mm on the upper left labia minora and the other measuring 3 mm on the
lower right labia minora, mild bilateral labial erythema and
induration, and vaginal discharge. No inguinal lymphadenopathy was
noted, and examination findings were normal for the cervix, uterus,
adnexa, and anus. Tests for gonorrhea and _Chlamydia trachomatis_
infection were negative; serologic tests for syphilis and hepatitis B
virus were not performed. A viral swab specimen from the left labial
lesion was submitted to ASVL for culture for possible herpes virus
infection. A primary diagnosis of sexually transmitted infection was
made but was not further characterized, and no specific treatment was
administered pending viral culture results. A secondary diagnosis of
vulvovaginal candidiasis was made, and the patient was treated with
an over-the-counter medication.
After 2 days of increased redness, swelling, and burning of the labia
minora, the woman returned to the clinic on 12 Oct 2006. The
evaluating health-care provider diagnosed cellulitis, discontinued
the over-the-counter preparation, and prescribed a 7-day course of
oral cephalexin (500 mg by mouth, twice a day). No specimens were
collected during the 2nd clinic visit. The patient's labial redness,
induration, and pain resolved, and the ulcers healed completely by 10 Oct 2006.
Laboratory Findings
-------------------
At ASVL, viral cytopathic effect was observed in viral culture cells
from the specimen collected from the woman on 10 Oct 2006; however,
immunofluorescent antibody staining was negative for herpes simplex
virus (HSV). During late October to November 2006, the viral isolate
was successfully passaged into 2 additional viral culture cell lines,
but subsequent staining of the viral isolate also was negative for
HSV and cytomegalovirus. The viral isolate was submitted on 22 Nov
2006 to a 2nd reference laboratory, where it remained unidentified
one month later.
On 9 Jan 2007, ASVL sent the unidentified viral isolate to CDC, where
the isolate was evaluated using 2 pathogen-discovery strategies: a
pan-herpes virus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and a
deoxyribonuclease sequence-independent, single-primer amplification
(DNase-SISPA) sequencing method,* in which a specimen is treated with
DNase, followed by nucleic acid extraction, random amplification,
restriction enzyme digestion, and SISPA of the restriction fragments.
Although the pan-herpes virus PCR assay was negative, the DNase-SISPA
method produced unique and prominent DNA fragments in the unknown
isolate but not in the control cells. The PCR product containing
these fragments was cloned and sequenced. Eight of 9 sequenced clones
of the bands matched vaccinia virus sequences. Additional PCR testing
by the CDC Poxvirus Laboratory identified the isolate as being
consistent with a vaccine-strain vaccinia virus. On 30 Jan 2007, CDC
notified ASVL of the results, which were immediately relayed to the
Alaska Section of Epidemiology.
Epidemiologic Investigation
-------------------------
After receiving notification of the laboratory result, Alaska state
health officials interviewed the patient and learned that she lived
alone and had never been vaccinated against smallpox. However, the
patient told investigators that her recent sex partner was a U.S.
service member stationed at a local military base and that he had
been her only sex partner during the period from one month before her
infection until the time her ulcers were completely healed (1 Sep to
19 Oct 2006). The patient also told investigators that her sexual
contact with her recent partner had included manual stimulation in
addition to vaginal intercourse. The patient did not remember seeing
bandages on her partner and did not know whether he had received any
recent vaccinations.
The service member was deployed overseas in late October 2006 and was
not available for interview. According to the preventive medicine
officer at the military base where the service member was stationed,
the service member had reported no underlying skin disorders or other
contraindications to vaccination. He had received smallpox
vaccination on 19 Sep 2006, after 1st receiving instruction on care
of the vaccination site and proper hand hygiene. Investigators
identified no additional transmission of the virus from the vaccinee
and no transmission from the woman to other persons, including
health-care providers who had examined her.

MMWR Editorial Note
------------------
This case of vulvar vaccinia was transmitted by a sex partner who had
recently received smallpox vaccination. Unintentional transfer of
vaccinia virus can occur from a vaccination site to a 2nd site on the
vaccinee (inadvertent autoinoculation) or to a close contact (contact
transmission)
(<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5501a1.htm>1).
The most frequently reported sites of vaccinia infections caused by
unintentional transfer are the face, nose, mouth, lips, genitalia,
anus, and eye
(<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5501a1.htm>1).
To prevent transfers, health-care providers should educate vaccinees
regarding proper hand washing after bandage changes or other contact
with the vaccination site
(<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5204a1.htm>2).
This general recommendation remains the most effective way to prevent
genital vaccinia infections. Persons with any new genital lesion,
including lesions suspected to have been caused by vaccinia
infection, should avoid sexual contact and consult a health-care provider.
Vulvar vaccinia infections often are characterized by painful labial
ulcers and/or vesicles, vulvar edema and pruritus, vaginal discharge,
and occasionally by vaginitis and tender bilateral inguinal
lymphadenopathy (3--9). Most reports of vulvar vaccinia were
published before cessation of widespread smallpox vaccination
programs (7); however, in addition to the case described in this
report, laboratory-confirmed cases of vulvar vaccinia after sexual
contact with vaccinated military personnel have been reported in New
York and Texas since the U.S. military resumed smallpox vaccination
in 2002 (8,9). Similar to the case described in this report, herpes
virus infection was initially suspected in the New York case, and
information regarding contact with a recent smallpox vaccinee was not
disclosed until after laboratory evidence of vaccinia virus had been detected.
Laboratory confirmation of orthopoxvirus infections, including
vaccinia, requires test methods that are not commercially available.
However, tests for orthopoxvirus infections are available at many
state and local health departments via the Laboratory Response
Network, and confirmatory (i.e., species-specific) testing is
available at CDC. In the case described in this report, initial
testing of clinical specimens for presumed herpes virus infection at
ASVL was inconclusive. In the absence of critical information (i.e.
patient contact with a recent smallpox vaccinee) to guide testing of
the isolate, ASVL forwarded the specimen to CDC. Identification of
vaccinia as the etiologic agent illustrates the power of using
multiple new tools for identifying pathogens in patients with a
disease of unknown etiology.
Since 8 Mar 2007, CDC and the U.S. Department of Defense have
received reports of 4 instances of nongenital contact vaccinia
associated with recently vaccinated service members, including 2
cases from Indiana and one case each from Alabama and New Mexico.
Health-care providers and public health professionals should ask
about any contact with recent smallpox vaccinees when evaluating
patients with vesicular lesions compatible with vaccinia. Early
identification of such contact can guide diagnostic tests, allow for
timely contact tracing and clinical intervention, and facilitate
prompt patient counseling to prevent further transmission of the virus.
