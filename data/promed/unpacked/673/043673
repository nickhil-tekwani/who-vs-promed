EASTERN EQUINE ENCEPHALITIS, EQUINE - USA: VACCINATION

Once again we are seeing epidemic and epizootic outbreaks for which
we receive reports containing only numerators. Are there any state
veterinarians in the eastern U.S. willing to share with ProMED
readers the following information?
(a) the number of unvaccinated horses that have been infected with
Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) in their state;
(b) the number of (estimated) unvaccinated horses there are in their state;
(c) the number of fully vaccinated horses (and perhaps boosted) that have
been infected with EEEV in their state; and
(d) the number of (estimated) vaccinated horses there are in their state.
With such data we could better determine whether some proportion of the horse
deaths might have been reduced had people vaccinated their horses. (I
suppose it is too much to ask for parallel and comparative surveillance data
for mosquitoes & birds as well.)
Seems as though each year we begin at Square One, as though no one had ever
considered any of this.
Here in northern Colorado we sit with dead human neighbors, dead and dying
horses, and birds falling onto yards and -- just as for EEEV -- we have scant
data publicly available regarding West Nile virus infections and their
epidemiology. All we know is that there is a lot of it out there.

[I very much doubt whether there is any hard data unless the vaccine
companies are willing to share it.
What I have noticed is that many of our Louisiana horse owners tend to be
reactive vaccinators -- on getting a positive EEE virology report on his dead
horse, one owner brilliantly commented that he had better get the rest
vaccinated now -- and the relatively high cost of WN vaccine might have a
negative knock-on impact on other equine vaccinations. Unfortunately they
don't seem to realize that the weather that favors one infection (EEE) favors
the others as well (e.g. WNV).
Over in Val Verde County, TX last week we suffered downpours the equivalent
of anything I have seen here in Louisiana, and this is after some 7 years of
field trips in west Texas where I had never seen a drop of rain before. They
had just had some 3-4 horses with encephalitis. - Mod.MHJ]
