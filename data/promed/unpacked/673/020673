Subject: Feline Plague in New Mexico

New Mexico has reported a total of 294 feline plague cases from 1977
through the present. 3 cases have been identified this year, all in Santa
Fe County. The first human plague case of the year has just been confirmed
from the same area as the cat cases (the human case was flea bite acquired).
In the last post on feline plague [Plague, cats - USA (Nevada): alert
20010627.1225, the moderator commented it was not known if the increase in
cat plague cases was due to an increase in infection, improved
surveillance, or increased awareness by veterinarians. The first 2 cases of
reported feline plague (in 1977, in Arizona and New Mexico) were recognized
because they resulted in human plague cases.
It certainly appeared the increase in report of cases after that, at least
through the 1980s, was probably due to improved surveillance and increased
awareness by veterinarians. A great deal of effort has been expended by the
New Mexico Department of Health to educate physicians and veterinarians on
the symptoms and treatment of plague. In the last 10 years or so, the
incidence of reported feline plague in New Mexico has more closely
reflected the level of plague activity in rodents.
For a more recent summary of all cat-associated human plague cases, see
"Cases of Cat-Associated Human Plague in the Western U.S., 1977-1998" by
Kenneth Gage, et al, Clinical Infectious Diseases 2000; 30:893-900.

[In addition to the programs New Mexico has instituted to raise awareness
of the situation, there has also been the advent of specialized cat
practice. 20 or more years ago, the speciality of a cat-only veterinary
practice was rare, now it is common place. - Mod.MHJ/TG
