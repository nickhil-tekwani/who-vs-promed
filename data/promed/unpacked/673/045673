Health officials from the Republic of Fiji have reported an outbreak of leptospirosis in the Central and Northern divisions.

In response to this bacterial disease outbreak, the Fiji Ministry of Health recently announced it 'is working to manage the situation, increasing disease surveillance, conducting clean-up and awareness campaigns.'

Fiji's last leptospirosis outbreak was reported in 2016.

To notify international travelers, the US CDC issued a level 1 travel alert for Fiji on [25 Sep 2020]. 'Travelers at the highest risk for infection are those exposed to contaminated fresh water while swimming, wading, kayaking, or rafting.' Furthermore, the risk of leptospirosis increases after heavy rainfall and flooding.

Leptospirosis is also a potential hazard for adventure travelers who spend time around animals, such as veterinarians, animal caretakers, agricultural workers, and humanitarian aid workers.

Leptospirosis is [caused by] a bacterium that can enter the human body through the skin or mucous membranes, such as eyes, nose, or mouth. People and animals can get infected with leptospirosis when they are exposed to the urine of infected animals, says the CDC. They can also get infected from water, soil, or food contaminated with infected animal urine.

Leptospirosis symptoms include fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, vomiting, stomach pain, diarrhea, jaundice, red eyes, and skin rash. Without treatment, leptospirosis can lead to kidney damage, meningitis, liver failure, respiratory distress, and even death.

If you feel sick during travel, the CDC suggests seeking medical care immediately, as leptospirosis can be treated with antibiotics, which are most effective when taken early during illness. Furthermore, after a trip abroad, if you get sick after returning to the USA, seek medical care immediately. And, tell the clinician about your travel and that you think you have been exposed to contaminated water.

The Republic of Fiji is an island country in Oceania in the South Pacific Ocean about 1000 nautical miles northeast of New Zealand. Fiji consists of an archipelago of more than 330 islands and more than 500 islets, reports Britannica.

As of [21 Sep 2020], Fiji announced it has resumed most transportation options. If you decide to travel to Fiji, the US Department of State suggests the following action items; visit the CDC's webpage on Travel and COVID-19; enroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program to receive security messages and make it easier to locate you in an emergency, and US citizens who travel abroad should always have a contingency plan for emergency situations, such as the Traveler's Checklist at https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-checklist.html.

[Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that is distributed widely throughout the world. Although leptospirosis is more common in tropical areas, it is also found in temperate areas. It is transmitted to humans by direct contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes with the urine of infected animals or by contact with wet soil, vegetation, or fresh (not salty) water that has been contaminated with infected animal urine. These animals are mostly asymptomatic but chronically infected with one of the several hundred serovars of the spirochete _Leptospira interrogans_.

Many species of wild and domestic animals (including rodents, dogs, cattle, swine, and perhaps river otters) are susceptible to chronic urinary tract infection with _Leptospira_. In these animals, leptospiruria persists for long periods or for life, and _Leptospira_ bacteria shed in urine may survive in fresh water or moist soil for weeks to months.

Leptospirosis is an occupational hazard for people who work outdoors or with animals; for example, workers in wet agricultural settings (such as rice field workers), ranchers, slaughterhouse workers, trappers, loggers, sewer workers, veterinarians, fishery workers, dairy farmers, or military personnel. Leptospirosis is also a risk from household exposure to infected pet animals or rodents.

Leptospirosis is a risk during recreational activities such as camping, fresh water swimming, canoeing, kayaking, rafting, golfing, and trail biking that involve exposure to water in lakes, rivers, or ponds contaminated by urine from _Leptospira_-infected animals.

Outbreaks frequently follow heavy rainfalls, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers.

Conditions favoring rat infestation in urban settings include older housing in poor repair that permits access to food and harborage for rats, inadequate disposal of trash and debris; lumber and firewood piles not stacked off the ground; abandoned automobiles and appliances; dilapidated outbuildings; inadequately maintained sewer systems; and parks, subways, railroad lines, and highways that can provide a suitable habitat.

The news release does not state how the diagnosis of leptospirosis was made in the cases. Because the clinical manifestations of leptospirosis can be non-specific, laboratory confirmation is necessary. The _Leptospira_ Dip-S-Tick (DST) IgM dot-ELISA test kits (PanBio Integrated Diagnostics) can provide in-the-field testing of suspected patients (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC149700/). Confirmatory testing uses the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Molecular assays such as DNA PCR can also be used, if available.

Fiji is an island nation in Melanesia in the South Pacific Ocean about 2000 km (1300 miles) northeast of New Zealand's North Island (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiji). Fiji is divided into 4 major divisions: Central, Eastern, Northern, and Western. For a map of Fiji's divisions, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fiji_divisions_named.png.

Fiji's wet season is from November to April, with the heaviest rains falling between December and mid-April (http://www.lonelyplanet.com/fiji/weather). The source for the current outbreak in Fiji is not explicitly stated in the news report above, only stating they are "conducting clean-up" campaigns. - Mod.ML
