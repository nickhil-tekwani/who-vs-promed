Rabies, animal: According to a report by the Directorate of the Department of
Health, in Cochabamba during the first half of the year, 91 cases of rabies
were reported in dogs and cats. In addition, an average of 15 cases a month
are reported. With the goal of avoiding an increase in rabies, the Health
Unit carried out a vaccination campaign that included 106,972 dogs and cats.
Dr. Efrain Vallejo, Chief of the Vectors and Zoonoses Unit, released a
report on the work in controlling various diseases during the first half of
the year in different parts of the city as well as the tropical area of the
provinces of Valle Alto y Bajo of Cochabamba.
Malaria: In the first half of this year, 1,191 cases have been reported.
"The number does not represent 100% of the data reported, but only accounts
for about 50% of what the Malaria Program actually finds in the course of
reporting cases little by little among the townships," according to Dr.
Vallejo. He reported that there are towns at high risk such as Villa Tunari
(336 cases), Toro (north of Potosi) (260), Aiquile (116), Vila Vila (93),
Anzaldo (63), Pojo (Valle) (48), Puerto Villarroeal (41), Mizque (36),
Shinahota (29), and Omereque (27).
Leishmaniasis: In the tropical area of Cochabama at total of 31 of cases
have been reported this year. They were diagnosed and treated with the help
of the Panamerican Health Organization, the University Center for Tropical
Medicine of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of San Simon. The
cases are mostly from the towns of Rio Pojo (Entre Rios), Villa Tunari and
Puerto Villarroel, but mostly they are coming from Chapare and Carrasoco
Tropical.
Yellow fever: Since January, 42 cases with 80% mortality have been
reported. Most of the patients are from the tropical regions or came into
the area to escape being vaccinated [apparently, successfully -- Mod CHC].
The Department of Health completed a vaccination program during the first
half of the year that included 81,000 individuals.
Chagas disease: no statistics of incidence of disease were reported, but an
extensive eradication program is being carried out.
