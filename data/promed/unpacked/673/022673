Lassa fever [LF] situation report -- epidemiological week 19 (4-10 May 2020)
------------------------------
Key points
------------
Current week (19) [4-10 May 2020) / Cumulative weeks 1-19 / Cumulative 2019 weeks 1-19
Suspected cases: 72 / 4693 / 2426
Confirmed cases: 9 / 1000 / 569
Probable cases: 0 / 14 / 15
Deaths: 1 / 192 / 128
Case fatality rate (CFR [%]): 11.1 / 19.2 / 22.5
Number of states affected: 4 / 27 / 21
Local government areas (LGAs) affected: 5 / 128 / 82

Highlights

- In week 19, the number of new confirmed cases increased from 5 cases in week 18, 2020 to 9 cases. These were reported from 4 States (Ondo, Edo, Ebonyi and Kogi) (Table 3).

- Cumulatively from week 1 to week 19, 2020, 192 deaths have been reported with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 19.2%, which is lower than the CFR for the same period in 2019 (22.5%).

- In total for 2020, 27 states have recorded at least one confirmed case across 128 Local Government Areas (Figure 2 and 3).

- Of all confirmed cases, 72% are from Edo (33%), Ondo (32%) and Ebonyi (7%) States.

- The predominant age-group affected is 21-30 years (Range: under 1 to 78 years, Median Age: 33 years). The male to female ratio for confirmed cases is 1:1.2 (Figure 4).

- The number of suspected cases has significantly increased compared to that reported for the same period in 2019.

- No new healthcare worker was affected in the reporting week 19.

- Lassa fever outbreak emergency phase declared over on the 28 Apr 2020 based on composite indicators national threshold.

- National Lassa fever multi-partner, multi-sectoral Technical Working Group (TWG) continues to coordinate the response activities at all levels.

Response activities
- The National multisectoral Lassa fever Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) activated to coordinate response activities across states. States with confirmed cases have activated state- level EOCs.
- National Rapid Response Teams have been deployed from NCDC to support response activities in 10 states.
- Surge staff (Doctors, Nurses, Laboratorians and Hygienist) deployed to ISTH and FMC Owo.
- State Public Health Emergency Operations Centre activated in affected states.
- The 5 Lassa fever molecular laboratories in the NCDC network are working full capacity to ensure that all samples are tested and results provided within the shortest turnaround time
- NCDC is working to support every state in Nigeria to identify one treatment centre, while supporting existing ones with care, treatment and IPC commodities.
- Risk communications and community engagement activities have been scaled up across states using television, radio, print, social media and other strategies.
- Implementation of Lassa fever Environmental response campaign in high burden states by Federal Ministry of Environment.

Notes on this report
-----------------
Data source
-----------
Information for this disease was case-based data retrieved from the National Lassa fever EOC.

Case definitions
-------------
- Suspected case: any individual presenting with one or more of the following: malaise, fever, headache, sore throat, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, myalgia, chest pain, hearing loss, and has either a) history of contact with excreta or urine of rodents, or b) history of contact with a probable or confirmed Lassa fever case within a period of 21 days of onset of symptoms, OR any person with inexplicable bleeding/hemorrhagia.
- Confirmed case: any suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody, PCR, or virus isolation).
- Probable case: any suspected case (see definition above) who died or absconded without collection of a specimen for laboratory testing.
- Contact: anyone who has been exposed to an infected person, or to an infected person's secretions, excretions, or tissues within 3 weeks of last contact with a confirmed or probable case of Lassa fever.
- Healthcare worker (HCW) infections may not necessarily be of nosocomial origin; proposed study to differentiate nosocomial healthcare worker infection from community infection.

Calculations
------------
- Case fatality rate (CFR) for this disease is reported for confirmed cases only.

[The 9 new confirmed and 89 new suspected cases in week 19 (4-10 May 2020) indicate that Lassa fever (LF) virus transmission is continuing but declining considerably. The decline is doubtless responsible for the declaration of the end of the emergency phase of the disease on 28 Apr 2020. The graph in figure 6 indicates that a peak of cases may have occurred in week 7. There are now 192 deaths among confirmed cases so far this year (2020). Fortunately, there are no newly infected healthcare workers during the current week (week 16).

The report above confirms that Ondo, Ebonyi and Edo states have the majority of cases. The area affected remains at 27 states, but local government areas by one to 128 with at least one case. Nigeria is into the period of the year when fewer cases usually occur, as illustrated in the graph in Figure 6 (available at the source URL above). There has been a peak in case numbers between weeks 1 and 11 (January-March) over the past 3 years, and it appears that this is the case again this year (2020).

Transmission of LF virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir host excreta or are within healthcare facilities. It is encouraging to learn that risk communications and community engagement activities have been scaled up across states using television, radio, print, social media, and other strategies for avoidance of contact with rodent virus reservoirs and their excreta.
