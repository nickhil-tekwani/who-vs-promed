More than 500 onion farmers in West Pokot [District, Rift Valley] risk incurring massive losses following an invasion by a fungal disease. The disease, which struck just when the crop was about to be harvested, has defied known treatments and left the farmers in despair.

The farmers now want the Ministry of Agriculture to diagnose the disease and recommend appropriate treatment or an onion variety resistant to the attack before the next planting season.

An agricultural officer said extension officers had been deployed to investigate the disease, which is suspected to be purple blotch. "We are conducting laboratory tests on the affected crops to ascertain the infection," he said.

Traders said the disease had reduced sales because of low output and poor quality of bulbs.

[Purple blotch of onion is caused by the fungus _Alternaria porri_. Crop losses depend on environmental conditions and may range from 25 to 90 percent. The damage may continue to develop post-harvest. Symptoms include small, water-soaked lesions with purple centres on leaves, leaf bases, and flower stalks, which expand and result in necrotic patches. The disease is favoured by high humidity and often occurs as a secondary infection on plants already affected by other pathogens or pests (for example, onion thrips). The pathogen is mostly spread with infected plant material and by mechanical means (including insects and human activities). Disease management may include fungicides, clean planting material, phytosanitation to minimise inoculum, and crop rotation.

With a final diagnosis apparently still pending, the disease is reported to have destroyed more than 1000 acres of onion crops in the Pokot area.
