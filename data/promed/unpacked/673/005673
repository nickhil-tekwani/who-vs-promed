ANTHRAX, WILDLIFE - ETHIOPIA

From: Martin Hugh-Jones <mehj@mail.vetmed.lsu.edu>

I have received information from various reliable sources that there has
recently been an outbreak of anthrax in the Omo Mago National Park in SW
Ethiopia; this area is one of the main drainages from Lake Tana. It has
been laboratory confirmed. It appears to have claimed some 100 Lesser Kudu
and cattle in nearby farms have also been affected.
Additional information has been sought from the Ethiopian Wildlife
Conservation Organisation in Addis Ababa.
