BOVINE VACCINATION - UK (04): BADGER VACCINATION

Two areas near Tiverton in Devon have been earmarked for a pilot
scheme to see if vaccinating badgers can reduce the spread of bovine
tuberculosis (TB).

Badgers are blamed by many farmers for spreading the disease, which
affects cattle. The South West, west of England and Wales have been
worst affected.

The pilot will run in 6 areas and involve contractors working with
vets and farmers to trap and inject badgers.

The trial is due to last 5 years and is expected to start next May 2010.

At the moment Defra [Department for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs] is talking to vets and farmers in each of the 6 areas to get
them involved, and they do not have to sign up for all 5 years.

Two 100-sq-km (39-sq-mile) areas east and west of Tiverton [Devon]
will be used to trial the badger vaccination programme. The other
sites will be in Staffordshire, Gloucestershire and on the
Herefordshire and Worcestershire border.

According to Defra, the trial is more about testing how the deployment
of trappers and vets will work, rather than a scientific test of the
vaccine.

The vaccine is effective for just 12 months, so badgers will have to
be trapped several times over the course of the trial to give them
booster injections.

Devon has been particularly hard hit by the spread of bovine tuberculosis.

In March 2009, church leaders, farmers and rural campaigners called on
the government to halt a deepening spread of bovine tuberculosis in
Devon. In an open letter written to Defra minister Hilary Benn, they
pleaded with him to find a solution. They alleged the disease was
causing misery to thousands of farmers in Devon, bringing many to the
edge of despair, and claimed that 16 000 cattle had been slaughtered
in Devon after contracting bovine TB since 2006.

[Subscribers are referred to the 8 Apr 2009 Final Report of the Bovine
TB Advisory Group, presented to UK's Minister for Farming and the
Environment, and the chief veterinary officer for Defra. The document
is available at
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/tb/pdf/tbag-finalreport.pdf>. See
also item 2 in post 20090514.1809.

The conclusions (page 4) include the following point 8, with which the
undersigned moderator fully concurs:

"Given the current rate of spread of TB, we are concerned there may be
over-reliance on a future vaccination programme (cattle and badgers);
this should not negate the urgent need for measures to tackle the
problem now." - Mod.AS]

[There is some concern that trapping badgers every year to vaccinate
them will cause them to move to new areas, thus spreading the disease
and making the situation worse.
