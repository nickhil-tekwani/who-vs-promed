[1] Singapore: reopening
Date: Wed 28 Jul 2021

Singapore is aiming for a feat no country has achieved so far: reopen to the world and emerge from the pandemic with a death toll still in the double digits.

While the U.S. and U.K. have plowed headlong into reopening their economies, their failure to contain the virus early on resulted in hundreds of thousands of fatalities. Vaccine hesitancy is also providing a reality check for strategies that treated inoculation as the magic bullet. At the other end of the spectrum, places like Australia and New Zealand managed to avoid the pathogen almost entirely, but slow progress with shots means they're unable to lift the border controls and quarantines that keep them isolated.

Singapore is seeking to succeed at both. In a plan laid out by officials this week, the tiny city-state that relies on being globally connected is eyeing the resumption of some international travel by September [2021]. To do that, it's trying to snuff out an outbreak driven by the delta variant and reach a vaccination level -- 80% -- that few countries have achieved, but which the government says will put Singapore in a position where it can live with the virus without carnage.

Its leaders don't have much of a choice. The country's success at limiting the number of COVID-19 deaths to 37 came in part from efforts to seal off its population from the outside world for more than a year. Other restrictions include limiting indoor dining, exercising, and social gatherings. The result is an island nation with cabin fever, desperate to venture beyond the 50 kilometers [31 mi] it runs from east to west, and 27 kilometers [16.8 mi] from north to south. While the promise of easier travel for the vaccinated sparked jubilation in Singapore, the question remains if its leaders will actually take what will be a leap of faith for a nation where even one locally-transmitted COVID-19 case makes the front page.

They earlier pledged to begin easing restrictions once half the population was vaccinated; that milestone came and went on 19 Jul [2021]. Like other so-called Covid Zero countries, which eliminated the virus with aggressive rules and border curbs, Singapore has lower levels of natural immunity, which makes opening up borders that have kept the virus in check for so long a daunting proposition.

"At this stage, given the multitude of public statements on the vaccination coverage, the government has not really given themselves much room to maneuver," said Nydia Ngiow, Singapore-based senior director at BowerGroupAsia, a strategic policy advisory firm. "They need to put their money where their mouth is and make the steps towards an endemic COVID-19 once we hit the 80% threshold, or risk being held accountable."

Singapore's hesitation in opening up, despite vaccination levels that would be the envy of much of the world, reflects the conundrum its traditionally cautious leaders find themselves in. The rise of the delta variant and evidence that vaccinations may offer less protection against infection by new strains led officials to question the safety of their earlier plans. "We are determined to get to our destination of being a Covid-resilient Singapore," said Gan Kim Yong, the trade and industry minister who's also co-chair of the pandemic taskforce. "But our journey must take into consideration public health realities. Sometimes, we may need to take a detour if we see hazards ahead. This way, we can ensure that we will get to our final destination safely, even though it may take a little longer."

If Singapore pulls off its pivot, it'll provide a template for Covid Zero places that include mainland China, Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong, to rejoin the world. Yet it also risks becoming a cautionary tale.

While those leading the pandemic response say they expect to treat Covid as an endemic infection, much like influenza, the flu can infect a thousand people in Singapore every day during peak season. It's hard to imagine political and public health leaders that have shut down the country over a smaller number of often mild COVID-19 infections standing by if 1000 people a day come down with COVID-19.

"Will there be deaths? Yes. Is there a threshold that will cause the government to waver? There should be one if the government is sensible," said Jeremy Lim, associate professor at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health at the National University of Singapore.

If new variants of concern emerge, particularly any that are more dangerous than the delta strain, or if hospitalizations and deaths far exceed anticipated numbers, then dialing back the reopening plan "would not only be technically correct, but also morally an imperative," he said.

Singapore's stance positions it to be one of the first countries to test the theories that epidemiologists and virologists crafted when COVID-19 first emerged. Many predicted that herd immunity -- a widespread level of protection that essentially means that the virus does not have enough vulnerable people left to infect and therefore can't take hold in a community -- would exist in areas where more than 70% of the population has been vaccinated. While flattening the curve and getting to herd immunity via vaccination was a goal of many nations, Singapore may show whether it's attainable. Others, including the Maldives, the United Arab Emirates and Malta, are also flirting with the 80% vaccination rate that Singapore has targeted, though they suffered broader outbreaks that provide some natural immunity.

[Herd immunity for SARS-CoV-2 has been estimated to be between 80-90% of the population immune through vaccination or natural infection, and Singapore is about to achieve this level. Reopening the nation to international travel and life without lockdown will test this hypothesis. This island nation is hoping to be able to treat COVID-19 like other pandemic illnesses, flu for one. - Mod.LK

Two new JAMA Psychiatry meta-analyses link mental illness with COVID-19 death, with one also finding an association with hospitalization.

The 1st study, published yesterday [Tue 27 Jul 2021], was led by researchers from the CEReSS-Health Service Research and Quality of Life Center in Marseille, France. It consisted of 16 observational studies from 7 countries involving 19 086 patients with COVID-19 and mental illness from December 2019 - July 2020. The countries were Denmark (1 study), France (2), Israel (1), South Korea (3), Spain (1), the United Kingdom (1), and the United States (7). [Fond G, Nemani K, Etchecopar-Etchart D, et al. Association Between Mental Health Disorders and Mortality Among Patients With COVID-19 in 7 Countries: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. JAMA Psychiatry. Published online 27 Jul 2021. <doi:10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2021.2274>]

Regardless of the primary medical risk factors for severe COVID-19, patients with mental illnesses (e.g., addiction, depression) were more likely to die of COVID-19 than their peers in pooled crude and adjusted analysis (crude odds ratio [OR], 1.75; adjusted OR [aOR], 1.38). Patients with the severe mental illnesses included in the study--schizophrenia and bipolar disorder--had the highest ORs for death, with a crude OR of 2.26 and an aOR of 1.67.

The higher rate of severe COVID-19 "suggests that other factors lead to this health inequity in patients with mental health disorders, including several factors such as barriers to access to care, social determinants of health, immunological disturbances, and the effects of psychotropic drugs," the study authors wrote.

The researchers said that patients with certain mental illnesses, such as depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, may have impaired immune defenses to begin with. They suggested that improved healthcare staff training on mental illnesses, broader implementation of advanced directives and do-not-resuscitate orders, and removing barriers to obtaining healthcare could improve patient care.

"These findings suggest that patients with COVID-19 and mental health disorders should be targeted as a high-risk population for severe forms of COVID-19, requiring enhanced preventive and disease management strategies," the authors wrote, adding that future research should delve into risk evaluation for COVID-19 patients with each type of mental illness.

The 2nd study was published today [Wed 28 Jul 2021]. It was led by University of Toronto researchers and included 21 studies of more than 91 million people with and without mood disorders. 12 retrospective cohort studies, 8 retrospective case-control studies, and 1 exposure-crossover study from England (1), Israel (1), Italy (1), South Korea (2), Spain (2), Turkey (1), the United Kingdom (1), and the United States (12) were analyzed. [Ceban F, Nogo D, Carvalho IP, et al. Association Between Mood Disorders and Risk of COVID-19 Infection, Hospitalization, and Death: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. JAMA Psychiatry. Published online July 28, 2021. <doi:10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2021.1818>]
Compared with other COVID-19 patients, those with mood disorders were at significantly higher risk for hospitalization and death (OR for hospitalization, 1.31; OR for death, 1.51). The OR for death was similar to that for other risk factors for severe COVID-19 outcomes, including diabetes, liver disease, cancer, and obesity, the authors said.

There was no link between mood disorders and likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR, 1.27) or severe events (OR, 0.94). The researchers pointed out the incongruity of having no association between mood disorders and severe events when there was a strong link to hospitalization and death.

"Possible explanations for this finding include interstudy variation in how severe events were defined, differences across studies in event reporting and coding, and heterogeneity in statistical approaches," they wrote. "Furthermore, the COVID-19 severe events analysis included a relatively small sample size."

The investigators said that people with mood disorders are at greater risk for infection because of impaired immune response, propensity toward substance abuse and predisposing chronic diseases (e.g., obesity, cardiovascular disease), low ability to comply with public health measures, and social determinants of risk (e.g., poverty, lower health literacy, tendency to live in congregate-care facilities).

"These results suggest that individuals with mood disorders should be categorized as an at-risk group for COVID-19 hospitalization and death, providing [a] basis for vaccine prioritization," the study authors wrote. "Future research should address whether COVID-19 vaccinations exhibit differential efficacy in persons with mood disorders and whether COVID-19 infection affects the longitudinal trajectory of the underlying mental disorder."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this issue of Nature Medicine, studies by Barros-Martins et al (2) and Schmidt et al (3) capitalize on the ad hoc heterologous prime-boost vaccination that resulted from the halting of vaccination with ChAd in several European countries, which left partially vaccinated people the option of completing their vaccinations with an mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2 (BNT), from Pfizer-BioNTech); or mRNA-1273, from Moderna). Barros-Martins et al report that, compared with results obtained by homologous ChAd-ChAd dosing, the ChAd-BNT dosing strategy resulted in significantly greater immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgA immune responses directed against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and robust, 20- to >60-fold greater titers of neutralizing antibody against the alpha (B.1.1.7), beta (B.1.351), and gamma (P.1) SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (2). These neutralizing titers were approximately 3-fold higher than those in serum from the groups dosed with BNT-BNT (albeit with differing intervals between dose 1 and dose 2), with higher titers of the IgG and IgA subclasses. Similarly, Schmidt et al show significantly higher titers of IgG antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and receptor-binding domain after ChAd-mRNA (either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273) or mRNA-mRNA vaccination than after homologous ChAd-ChAd vaccination(3). In addition, the participants dosed with ChAd-mRNA demonstrate a greater number of circulating spike protein-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, as well as cytokine-producing T cells, than that of participants dosed with ChAd-ChAd. Schmidt et al further demonstrate comparable multifunctional, spike protein-specific CD4+ T cell responses but greater CD8+ T cell responses in the ChAd-mRNA group (3). A 3rd study, published recently in Lancet, provides additional evidence that the heterologous ChAd-mRNA vaccine approach is well tolerated and stimulates a robust IgG and neutralizing-antibody response (4). Combined, these studies show improved immunogenicity outcomes with heterologous dosing and suggest possible superiority of this strategy over homologous prime-boost regimens for cellular responses and neutralization of variants (Fig. 1)

Abstract
--------
"Currently approved viral vector-based and mRNA-based vaccine approaches against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) consider only homologous prime-boost vaccination. After reports of thromboembolic events, several European governments recommended using AstraZeneca's ChAdOx1-nCov-19 (ChAd) only in individuals older than 60 years, leaving millions of already ChAd-primed individuals with the decision to receive either a second shot of ChAd or a heterologous boost with mRNA-based vaccines. However, such combinations have not been tested so far. We used Hannover Medical School's COVID-19 Contact Study cohort of healthcare professionals to monitor ChAd-primed immune responses before and 3 weeks after booster with ChAd (n = 32) or BioNTech/Pfizer's BNT162b2 (n = 55). Although both vaccines boosted prime-induced immunity, BNT162b2 induced significantly higher frequencies of spike-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and, in particular, high titers of neutralizing antibodies against the B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 variants of concern of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
"Heterologous priming with the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vector vaccine followed by boosting with a messenger RNA vaccine (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273) is currently recommended in Germany, although data on immunogenicity and reactogenicity are not available. In this observational study we show that, in healthy adult individuals (n = 96), the heterologous vaccine regimen induced spike-specific IgG, neutralizing antibodies and spike-specific CD4 T cells, the levels of which were significantly higher than after homologous vector vaccine boost (n = 55) and higher or comparable in magnitude to homologous mRNA vaccine regimens (n = 62). Moreover, spike-specific CD8 T cell levels after heterologous vaccination were significantly higher than after both homologous regimens. Spike-specific T cells were predominantly polyfunctional with largely overlapping cytokine-producing phenotypes in all three regimens. Recipients of both the homologous vector regimen and the heterologous vector/mRNA combination reported greater reactogenicity following the priming vector vaccination, whereas heterologous boosting was well tolerated and comparable to homologous mRNA boosting. Taken together, heterologous vector/mRNA boosting induces strong humoral and cellular immune responses with acceptable reactogenicity profiles."

Summary
-------
"Background
To date, no immunological data on COVID-19 heterologous vaccination schedules in humans have been reported. We assessed the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of BNT162b2 (Comirnaty, BioNTech, Mainz, Germany) administered as second dose in participants primed with ChAdOx1-S (Vaxzevria, AstraZeneca, Oxford, UK).

"Methods
We did a phase 2, open-label, randomised, controlled trial on adults aged 18-60 years, vaccinated with a single dose of ChAdOx1-S 8-12 weeks before screening, and no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive either BNT162b2 (0.3 mL) via a single intramuscular injection (intervention group) or continue observation (control group). The primary outcome was 14-day immunogenicity, measured by immunoassays for SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein and receptor binding domain (RBD). Antibody functionality was assessed using a pseudovirus neutralisation assay, and cellular immune response using an interferon-γ immunoassay. The safety outcome was 7-day reactogenicity, measured as solicited local and systemic adverse events. The primary analysis included all participants who received at least one dose of BNT162b2 and who had at least one efficacy evaluation after baseline. The safety analysis included all participants who received BNT162b2. This study is registered with EudraCT (2021-001978-37) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04860739), and is ongoing.

"Findings
Between 24 and 30 Apr 2021, 676 individuals were enrolled and randomly assigned to either the intervention group (n=450) or control group (n=226) at 5 university hospitals in Spain (mean age 44 years [SD 9]; 382 [57%] women and 294 [43%] men). 663 (98%) participants (n=441 intervention, n=222 control) completed the study up to day 14. In the intervention group, geometric mean titres of RBD antibodies increased from 71.46 BAU/mL (95% CI 59.84-85.33) at baseline to 7756.68 BAU/mL (7371.53-8161.96) at day 14 (p<0.0001). IgG against trimeric spike protein increased from 98.40 BAU/mL (95% CI 85.69-112.99) to 3684.87 BAU/mL (3429.87-3958.83). The interventional:control ratio was 77.69 (95% CI 59.57-101.32) for RBD protein and 36.41 (29.31-45.23) for trimeric spike protein IgG. Reactions were mild (n=1210 [68%]) or moderate (n=530 [30%]), with injection site pain (n=395 [88%]), induration (n=159 [35%]), headache (n=199 [44%]), and myalgia (n=194 [43%]) the most commonly reported adverse events. No serious adverse events were reported.

"Interpretation
BNT162b2 given as a 2nd dose in individuals prime vaccinated with ChAdOx1-S induced a robust immune response, with an acceptable and manageable reactogenicity profile." - Mod.LK]
