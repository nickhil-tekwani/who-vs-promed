[The Q fever epidemic in South Netherlands has been continuing during 2009.
Earlier 2009 postings addressed mainly public health aspects of the issue,
precise routes of human infection remaining, at least in several cases,
rather ambiguous. The following Eurosurveillance Rapid Communication was
written jointly by public and animal health experts, covering both aspects.
- Mod.AS]

Since 1978, when Q fever in humans became a notifiable disease in the
Netherlands, until 2006, the number of notifications had ranged between one
and 32 cases annually, with an average of 17 cases per year. However, in
2007, Q fever emerged as an important human and veterinary public health
challenge, with large epidemics in the southern part of the Netherlands. In
2007, 168 human cases were notified, and in 2008 exactly 1000 human cases
were registered. Notification criteria for acute Q fever are a clinical
presentation with at least fever, or pneumonia, or hepatitis and
confirmation of the diagnosis in the laboratory. Currently, the laboratory
criteria are a 4-fold rise in IgG antibody titre against _C. burnetii_ in
paired sera or the presence of IgM-antibodies against phase II antigen.
Identification of _C. burnetii_ in patient material with a PCR test will
soon be added to the notification criteria. Notification of probable cases,
defined as clinical signs with a single high antibody titre is voluntary.

Current situation
-----------------
From April 2009, a sharp increase in Q fever was observed again, and a
total of 345 cases (including 13 probable) were notified between 1 Jan and
11 May 2009. For 11 cases, the date of illness onset was in 2008, and one
case fell ill in 2007, resulting in a total of 333 cases with confirmed or
presumed illness onset in 2009. The overall male-to-female ratio for these
333 cases was 1.7:1 with a median age of 49 years (IQR 38-61 years). The
epidemic curve for 2009 shows an even steeper increase in case numbers in
April-May than in the previous 2 years, suggesting that an epidemic of at
least the same magnitude as the one in 2008 is imminent. While most cases
reside in the same region in the province of Noord-Brabant as the cases
reported in 2007 and 2008, the geographic area seems to be expanding [map

Separate clusters with multiple sources
---------------------------------------
It is becoming increasingly clear that the overall outbreak consists of at
least 10 separate clusters with multiple sources, mainly in the province of
Noord Brabant. For some clusters, a clear epidemiological link could be
established to small ruminant farms with clinical Q fever cases in animals
presented as abortion waves. For other clusters, such a link was less
obvious. An example of the latter is a medium sized city (87 000
inhabitants) that experienced a 2nd Q fever outbreak in 2009 similar to the
one in 2008. In 2008, a dairy goat farm with abortions due to Q fever was
suspected as the source, but in 2009 there were no veterinary notifications
from the area. The 73 notified human cases residing in the city were
clustered in the same part of the city as the cases that were notified in
2008. It remains unclear whether the same source is involved, whether the
bacteria have persisted and survived in the local environment, whether the
primary source in 2008 has resulted in secondary sources in 2009, or
whether there is increased awareness among health professionals in this
part of the city based on the 2008 experience.

In March 2009, the Animal Health Service reported a Q fever positive farm
in the province of Limburg with more than 1000 goats. The place also serves
as a care farm for young people with mental disabilities who work there as
part-time farmhands. Prompted by this notification, the municipal health
service (MHS) South Limburg performed active laboratory screening by ELISA
of the individuals affiliated to this goat farm. The screening, which
involved a total of 96 people, has resulted in 28 notified symptomatic
cases to date.

Veterinary situation
--------------------
The total number of registered small ruminant farms in the Netherlands is
52 000, of which 350 are professional dairy goat farms with more than 200
adult goats, and 40 are professional dairy sheep farms. In 2005, Q fever
was diagnosed for the 1st time as a cause of abortion at a dairy goat farm,
using immunohistochemistry on sections of placenta. A 2nd case was
diagnosed later in 2005. In 2006, 2007 and 2008, 6, 7 and 7 new cases at
dairy goat farms were confirmed, respectively, mainly in the same area
where human cases occurred. In the same period, 2 cases of abortion caused
by _C. burnetii_ were confirmed at dairy sheep farms, one in the southern
and one in the northern part of the country, but these 2 cases do not seem
to be related to human cases. Analyses of abortion outbreaks showed that
the average number of goats per farm was 900, of which 20 percent aborted,
ranging from 10-60 per cent. The average number of sheep on both infected
sheep farms was 400, and the abortion rate was 5 per cent.

Abortion outbreaks before June 2008 were reported on a voluntary basis to
the Animal Health Service and also confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Since
June 2008, notification of Q fever in goats and sheep is mandatory in the
Netherlands. There is a legal requirement for farmers and their private
veterinary surgeons to notify the occurrence of abortion in small ruminants
held in deep litter houses. For large farms (greater than 100 animals), the
notification criterion is an abortion wave defined as an abortion
percentage higher than 5 per cent among pregnant animals. For smaller
holdings, a criterion of 3 or more abortions in a 30 day period is used.
From January to April 2009, this new regulation has led to notification of
3 dairy goat farms with clinical cases of Q fever. One farm is located in
the province of Overijssel (notified in February 2009), one in the south of
the province of Limburg (notified in March 2009), and one in the province
of Noord-Brabant (notified in April 2009). This veterinary notification can
potentially facilitate the detection of related human cases or clusters.
Veterinarians, physicians and the public are informed through targeted
mailings, publications and the media. The exact location of animal farms
with clinical Q fever is now reported to the municipal health service. In
February 2009, a nationwide stringent hygiene protocol became mandatory for
all professional dairy goat and sheep farms, independent of Q fever status.

Vaccination campaigns
---------------------
In the fall of 2008, a voluntary vaccination campaign was implemented in
the province of Noord Brabant. In total, about 36 000 small ruminants were
vaccinated in an area with a radius of 45 km around Uden, a small town in
the centre of the high-risk area. Another mandatory vaccination campaign
led by the Animal Health Service (GD) started on 21 Apr 2009. From April to
October 2009, 200 000 small ruminants will be vaccinated in an area which
includes the province of Noord-Brabant and parts of the provinces of
Gelderland, Utrecht and Limburg.

Conclusion
----------
For the 3rd consecutive year, the Netherlands is facing a large outbreak of
Q fever. The new upsurge in Q fever cases in 2009 is alarming. The
mandatory vaccination campaign among small ruminants that was started in
April 2009, if effective, is expected to reduce the occurrence of abortion
waves and excretion of _Coxiella_ in the lambing season of 2010. There is a
large portfolio of ongoing multidisciplinary research, but it will take
some time before results become available that eventually will lead to the
implementation of extended and improved control measures.

[During July 2009, the Dutch ministry of agriculture issued several press
releases concerning Q fever. They addressed mainly the following two topics:

1. Since animals should not be vaccinated during pregnancy and in view of
the need to increase the vaccination coverage, it was advised to delay the
breeding season of goats.
2. Specific requirements pertaining to the treatment of manure on the sheep
and goat farms were updated. Though such requirements address all farms,
they are different in infected and uninfected flocks.
