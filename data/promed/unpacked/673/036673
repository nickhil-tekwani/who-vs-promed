Spanish researchers have found subclinical (not causing signs of disease) besnoitiosis, a chronic and debilitating illness caused by a protozoan parasite mostly found in the Americas, in a "surprising" number of randomly screened equids in southern Spain. And while the animals aren't yet showing signs of disease, scientists believe clinical cases could soon occur in Europe.

"In the near future, new clinical cases could be expected to be reported (in Europe)," said Gema Álvarez-García, PhD, of the Animal Health Department in the Complutense University Faculty of Veterinary Sciences, in Madrid. "Surveillance should be implemented, and harmonized diagnostic procedures and standardized techniques are needed in order to get comparable results and infer reliable conclusions."

Álvarez-García and her fellow researchers tested blood samples from 553 horses, 85 donkeys, and 83 mules across Andalusia, which is home to more equids than any other region in Spain. They tested the animals for antibodies against _Besnoitia bennetti_, a single-cell protozoan that creates cysts. They also tested for 2 other cyst-generating protozoan species: _Sarcocystis neurona_ and _Neospora hughesi_, which are responsible for causing equine protozoal myeloencephalitis (EPM). These protozoa are abundant in North, South, and Central America but have historically been rare [in] other parts of the world.

They found that 7.1 percent of the tested equids were positive for the presence of antibodies against Besnoitia. Furthermore, 6.4 percent of the animals were positive for Neospora antibodies and 2.8 percent for Sarcocystis antibodies, Álvarez-García said. Although the animals didn't show clinical signs of disease, the positive results indicate that the animals had been exposed to the pathogens at some point.

"We were surprised concerning the number of seropositive animals detected," she said. "We reported 51 seropositive animals among 721 animals tested. This result contrasts to other previous epidemiological studies carried out in our country in other ungulate species, such as wild ruminant species, where clinical cases are known to occur, and only 2 seropositive animals were found among 4893 animals sampled."

Certain subspecies of Besnoitia have been affecting cattle and wild ruminants in Europe for years, she said. But those subspecies are not the kind that usually affect horses, donkeys, mules, and zebras.

In the U.S., besnoitiosis is an emerging equine disease that principally affects donkeys. However, it's important to note that it's not limited to donkeys, Álvarez-García said.

"The disease has been reported in different equid species, such as donkey, horse, mule, and zebra," she said. "However, the clinical disease has been more frequently diagnosed in donkeys."

In their study, they found more positives in the donkey and mule population than in the horse population, she added. But that doesn't mean these equids are more susceptible to the disease. It could be related to how donkeys and mules are managed compared to horses.

The only known case of besnoitiosis in a European equid occurred in a horse in northern France in 1922. However, scientists suspected the disease in a herd of donkeys in more recent years in southern Spain, Álvarez-García said.

Researchers have not yet determined the origin of the protozoa's presence in Europe, but they have theories. "There are 2 feasible explanations," she said. "Animal trade from areas where the disease is endemic or scattered cases from a ruminant species origin (as whether Besnoitia species infecting ruminants can also infect equids and vice versa remains to be elucidated)."

The percentages revealed in the study underscore a need for scientists and veterinarians to be more aware of the pathogen and its disease risks in Europe, said Álvarez-García.

"As it happened with bovine besnoitiosis in the past, the disease might be underestimated, taking into account that there is a suspicion of the presence of the disease (at least in our country) and that skin lesions associated with this parasitic disease might be confused with other skin diseases," she said.

"Thus, our recommendation is to carry out surveillance of this parasitic disease by including equine besnoitiosis in the differential diagnosis of skin diseases and conducting serosurveys (blood screenings) at least in those countries where bovine besnoitiosis is present, since it is not known whether this species might infect equids," Álvarez-García said. "Surveillance might help to detect clinical cases that are needed to isolate and genotype the parasite in order to clarify the numerous epidemiological gaps."

The study, "A serosurvey of selected cystogenic coccidia in Spanish equids: first detection of anti-Besnoitia spp. specific antibodies in Europe," was published in BMC Veterinary Research [see commentary].

[The paper discussed (Ref 1) was published in BMC Veterinary Research on 10 May 2017 (received 13 Feb 2017, accepted 4 May 2017). The abstract and conclusions follow:

1. Abstract
"Equine besnoitiosis, caused by _Besnoitia bennetti_, and equine protozoal myeloencephalitis (EPM), caused by _Sarcocystis neurona_ and _Neospora hughesi_ are relevant equine diseases in the Americas that have been scarcely studied in Europe. Thus, a serosurvey of these cystogenic coccidia was carried out in Southern Spain. A cross-sectional study was performed and serum samples from horses (n = 553), donkeys (n = 85) and mules (n = 83) were included. An in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was employed to identify a Besnoitia spp. infection and positive results were confirmed by an a posteriori western blot. For Neospora spp. and Sarcocystis spp., infections were detected using in-house ELISAs based on the parasite surface antigens _N. hughesi_ rNhSAG1 and _S. neurona_ rSnSAG2/3/4. Risk factors associated with these protozoan infections were also investigated."

2. Conclusions
"This study was the 1st extensive serosurvey of Besnoitia spp. infection in European equids accomplished by 2 complementary tests and gives evidence of the presence of specific antibodies in these populations. However, the origin of the infection is still unclear. Further parasite detection and molecular genotyping are needed to identify the causative Besnoitia and Neospora species. Finally, cross-reactions with antibodies directed against other species of Sarcocystis might explain the positive reactions against the _S. neurona_ antigens."

Clinical signs and lesions caused by _B. bennetti_ in donkeys in the USA, are described in references 2 and 3.

Two cases of besnoitiosis in European donkeys, of which one showed clinical signs, suspected to be caused by _B. bennetti_, have been described in a short communication published in 2016 by Belgian and French authors (Ref 4). The short communication follows:

"A 2-year-old male donkey was purchased in May 2016 in poor body condition (cachexia, alopetic areas, pruritus, dirty hair) by the present owner in Le Roeulx (Belgium) from a donkey farm aimed at milk production in Frasnes-lez-Buissenal (Belgium). Shortly after its purchase, the donkey was shorn and showed crusts, and hyperkeratosis with no other clinical signs except anorexia and cachexia. A treatment with phoxim was given without improvement; a cutaneous biopsy of hyperkeratotic skin was performed in July [2016] and showed a perivascular eosinophilic infiltrate with a large thick walled cyst located in the dermis. The cyst was filled with numerous bradyzoites. This was highly suggestive of besnoitiosis. A daily treatment based on sulfamethaxzole and trimethoprim was given orally and some improvement was noticed. Further clinical examination performed on August [2016] highlighted scleral pin-head sized cysts in right eye and between nares. Haematologic evaluation was unremarkable. Several skin biopsy samples were obtained for qPCR analysis and confirmed the presence of Besnoitia spp.'s DNA. Another 10-year-old female donkey purchased in France and sharing the same accommodation showed a good clinical condition. Punch-biopsy and haematology were realized on July [2016] but were unremarkable. A deepest clinical examination on August [2016] in this 2nd animal showed the presence of cysts on the inner face of upper labial mucosa. Further laboratory diagnosis tests are in progress through sera (Western Blot) and rDNA sequencing to confirm _Besnoitia bennetti_ aetiology. To the authors' knowledge, this is the 1st detection of _B. bennetti_ in donkeys in Europe."

Clinical expression of _B. bennetti_ in horses is yet to be demonstrated.
