[2022 proved to be a record year for dengue infections in many parts of the world, but particularly in Southeast Asia. Many areas are continuing to see cases due to recent flood events as reported in previous updates. Let us hope that between improved weather, seasonal declines, and vaccines coming to market, 2023 will be a turning point in the fight against dengue. - Mod.JH
