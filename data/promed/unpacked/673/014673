The Next Cholera Epidemic: How the Disease Could Spread from Syria
------------
A cholera outbreak that began in Iraq in mid-September 2015 has spread into war-torn Syria. From there, a massive flow of desperate refugees could carry the disease deep into the Middle East and even into southern Europe.

Humanitarian aid physicians working in Syria report that 3 cases have been confirmed in 2 cities controlled by the self-proclaimed Islamic State (also known as ISIS): Deir ez-Zor, in eastern Syria; and Aleppo, in the northwestern part of the country. Undoubtedly, these cases are just the tip of the iceberg. Under the best conditions, clinicians usually diagnose only 30 percent of the cholera cases that occur during epidemics; in Syria, where hospitals and clinics have been destroyed by air strikes, they're likely diagnosing far fewer.

This outbreak was predictable. Cholera is caused by a bacterial pathogen that passes between people via human waste and is easily spread through contaminated food and water. If introduced into crowded refugee camps with rudimentary sanitation, the pathogen can rapidly explode. Millions of people are internally displaced in Syria, and supplies to disinfect drinking water have been cut off outside government-controlled areas. 8 months ago, the World Health Organization (WHO) noted the country's vulnerability to cholera. And then 2 months ago [September 2015], the pathogen struck in neighboring Iraq, where 15 of 18 provinces are now infected. With a porous border and a mass exodus of Syrians, Iraqis, and others under way, cholera's arrival in Syria was just a matter of time.

Predictable and preventable cholera epidemics have reached historic proportions in recent years. In October 2010, 10 months after a magnitude-7 earthquake shattered the country, cholera arrived in Haiti, most likely for the 1st time in over 100 years. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had predicted as far back as 1999 that the country was ripe for an outbreak of waterborne diseases such as cholera, a warning echoed by nongovernmental aid organizations after the earthquake. The UN nevertheless ferried soldiers directly from cholera-struck Kathmandu, Nepal, into the country that October without testing them for cholera infection. Cholera erupted in Haiti days later; within a year, more than 450 000 Haitians had been affected, with 6435 deaths. A recently launched campaign to rid the island of cholera will take 10 years and cost over $2.2 billion.

The disease has now found a home in the Middle East, where crowded refugee camps and make-shift settlements in water-deprived towns and cities provide a perfect breeding ground. In Syria, over 13.5 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, including clean water and safe shelter, which can protect them from scourges such as cholera. Nearly 2 million have sought refuge in Turkey, where the vast majority must make do with tents or squat in abandoned buildings and semi-demolished houses, with no reliable access to safe water or sanitation. In Lebanon, where there are no official camps for refugees, over a million Syrians reside in informal settlements and shantytowns. Already diminishing water supplies -- Lebanon is in the midst of a years-long drought -- are being stretched beyond the limit. At a settlement in Beirut, a refugee described the dwindling, contaminated supply as "hell water." Under such conditions, cholera thrives.

As cholera wends its way through the battered alleys and tattered refugee tents of northern Syria, a similarly unprecedented epidemic is poised to unfold in the Middle East. The difference is that averting it is still possible. But the time to act is now.

Cholera may not reach epidemic proportions in the Middle East since the cholera bacterium thrives in warm surface waters; so it is possible that colder winter temperatures will send it into dormancy. Or that it will be carried into places where people enjoy sufficient access to clean drinking water and sanitation so that it can't take hold.

But it may very well erupt. And once it does, the caseload will grow exponentially, making containment difficult, expensive, and uncertain. That is why the most efficient and cost-effective way to control pathogens such as cholera is by stamping them out before many people are infected. But the WHO, the premier global health institution tasked with coordinating such efforts, is ill-fitted for the task.

Despite warnings that Syria was vulnerable to an epidemic of cholera, few precautions were taken. The WHO was not able to coordinate a mass vaccination campaign against cholera in Iraq until 6 weeks after the outbreak there started, leaving neighboring Syria dangerously vulnerable. By the time the campaign started, the disease had already spilled out of the country into 1 of the most broken parts of the world. Nor did the agency take measures to ensure that cholera could be spotted if it did appear in Syria. The laboratories capable of diagnosing cholera in northern and eastern Syria have been destroyed by the Bashar al-Assad regime. But the agency failed to position diagnostic lab equipment that can quickly distinguish cholera from other diseases, such as PCR machines, in accessible cross-border areas. As a result, cholera cases are being detected through cruder tests, which in a cruel Catch-22 the WHO does not accept as proof. As a result, despite a steady stream of reports of cholera-like disease from humanitarian aid doctors, for now, according to the agency, Syria is officially "free from cholera."

[As noted by the author above, formal confirmation of cholera in Syria has not been accepted by WHO, and it is not clear that culture specimens have been sent outside the ISIS-controlled area for identification. Given the "steady stream of reports of cholera-like disease from humanitarian aid doctors," _V. cholerae_ seems to have arrived in Syria. Besides Iraq -- which seems to have been the index country -- reports of cholera have come from Bahrain, Kuwait and Oman, and now Syria. It has been reported that the Omani case originated in Iraq; whether the other countries' cases originated in Iraq is not clear but likely. - Mod.LL
