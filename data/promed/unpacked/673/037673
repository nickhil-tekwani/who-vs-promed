[With the addition of the above newly reported laboratory confirmations, there have now been 411 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection including 112 deaths reported in Saudi Arabia since September 2012. Of the 15 newly confirmed cases, 7 were known contacts of previously laboratory confirmed infections, of whom 4 have no clinical symptoms, and 3 had clinical illness compatible with MERS-CoV infection. 3 of the newly confirmed cases had been hospitalized for weeks or months for other illnesses and then developed respiratory symptoms compatible with MERS-CoV infection. One case is a government hospital employee.

New information on patients who are no longer MERS-CoV positive and are being discharged home is being provided.

[2] UAE, 4 new infections - MOH

HAAD announces 6 cases diagnosed with MERS Coronavirus tested negative
----------------------------
The Health Authority - Abu Dhabi (HAAD) [United Arab Republic] is pleased to announce that 6 more of the individuals who are in isolation in hospital with MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection have now tested negative for the virus and will be leaving hospital soon. With this, the number of individuals who have tested negative has risen to 27.

HAAD said that these 6 cases were kept in isolation at hospitals as a precautionary measure. They were able to clear the virus within 10-14 days themselves without any treatment.

It is expected that the other individuals with positive MERS coronavirus currently in isolation in hospitals will likewise soon test negative and be able to go home. They are being tested daily to check on their positive status.

HAAD also announced 4 new cases with MERS-CoV. Most have either no symptoms or mild symptoms and are expected to clear the virus soon. They have been admitted to hospital for isolation until they clear the virus.

HAAD confirmed that it is coordinating with the Ministry of Health (MOH) and other authorities in the country and has taken all necessary measures as per international standards and recommendations from the World Health Organisation (WHO).

HAAD has been engaging world authorities from expert international organizations who are now in Abu Dhabi to help shed light on various aspects of the virus, including modes of transmission, and best practice in managing viral infections of this type.

The MOH stated that the WHO confirmed the virus is not a concern for public health at the moment and that the current situation does not require a travel ban to any country in the world, screenings at different ports, or any restrictions on trade.

The MOH confirmed that it is monitoring the situation closely to ensure the health and safety of everyone.

The 1st identified U.S. case of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) was diagnosed this week at Community Hospital, Munster, Indiana. The patient, whose name is being kept confidential, remains hospitalized in good condition and is improving each day. As of today [4 May 2014], no other cases of MERS have been identified [in the USA].

"We are very pleased the patient is improving, and no other cases have been identified at this time," said State Health Commissioner William VanNess II, M.D. "The individual has received excellent care while at Community Hospital in Munster. The swift diagnosis and precautionary measures taken have undoubtedly greatly helped reduce the risk of this potentially serious virus spreading."

The Indiana State Department of Health is working with the hospital, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and others to monitor the situation and prevent the spread of the virus. Representatives from the CDC arrived in Indianapolis yesterday [3 May 2014] to assist and arrived at the hospital this morning.

Since symptoms of MERS may take up to 14 days to occur, staff members at the hospital who had direct contact with the patient prior to the patient being placed in full isolation have been taken off duty and placed in temporary home isolation. Those individuals are being closely monitored for any signs or symptoms of the virus and will be allowed to return to work once the incubation period is over and they have confirmed negative laboratory results.

There have been no reported cases of people without symptoms transmitting this virus.

"The patient is in full isolation and presents no risk to patients, staff or the general community," said Don Fesko, CEO of Community Hospital in Munster. "We are thoroughly prepared to handle respiratory infections. We continue to work closely with the CDC and State Health Department and are following every recommendation. Safety is our top priority."

For questions about MERS, please call the Indiana State Department of Health hotline at 1-877-826-0011, which is being answered daily, 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. EDT. A voicemail system is available for callers to leave a message during off hours. All calls will be returned 1st thing the following morning.

To keep you and your family healthy by reducing your risk of disease, follow CDC's tips below:
- Wash your hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds, and help young children do the same. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
- Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, then throw the tissue in the trash.
- Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
- Avoid close contact, such as kissing, sharing cups, or sharing eating utensils with sick people.
- Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces, such as toys and doorknobs.

[On [24 Apr 2014], the patient traveled by plane from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia to London, England then from London to Chicago, Illinois. The patient then took a bus from Chicago to Indiana. On [27 Apr 2014], the patient began to experience respiratory symptoms, including shortness of breath, coughing, and fever. The patient went to an emergency department in an Indiana hospital on [28 Apr 2014] and was admitted on that same day. See post (48) listed below. - Mod.JW]

[The description of the management of cases and contacts suggests that should there have been transmission of the MER-CoV from this patient to HCWs, the chain of transmission within the hospital would have been markedly reduced, as these individuals are being removed from active patient care until they are cleared of disease following one incubation period. The unfortunate "wild card" here will be how well the home isolation is observed, preventing transmission among the community outside of the health care environment.
