A horse died late Friday [22 Dec 2006] at Payson Park, a 500-horse
boarding facility in Indiantown, said Florida Department of
Agriculture spokesman Mark Fagan.
It was the 1st suspected case reported in Martin County, and the
facility, off Kanner Highway, is now under state-mandated quarantine,
Fagan said.
Payson Park officials could not be reached for comment on Sunday [24
Dec 2006]. While the facility is under quarantine, Fagan said, there
is not a major concern for the hundreds of other horses there.
"There are multiple barns at Payson," he said. "That particular horse
did not mingle with those other horses. As a result, we don't feel
they're in danger. But we will monitor those horses as well." 10
horse facilities in Florida are under state-mandated quarantine,
Fagan said, one in Ocala, where a racehorse that had been at the
clinic started showing symptoms, the one in Indiantown and 8 in Palm
Beach County.
Many stable and backyard horse owners in Martin, St. Lucie and Indian
River counties have implemented a voluntary quarantine -- limiting
contact with trainers, riders and other horses -- to limit virus
transmission. Some horse owners are making sure their other vaccines
-- specifically for the similar rhinovirus -- are up to date.
There have been 10 confirmed cases and another 8 suspected cases of
the virus pending confirmation in Florida, Fagan said.
The Martin County horse was a filly that showed signs of a low-grade
fever on 11 Dec 2006. It arrived at the Palm Beach Equine Clinic in
Wellington on 12 Dec 2006, was released on 13 Dec 2006 and succumbed
late Friday [22 Dec 2006], Fagan said. The animal was taken to the
University of Florida on Saturday [23 Dec 2006] to be tested for the virus.
The Wellington clinic has been identified as the place where the
outbreak of equine herpesvirus, also known as equine
rhinopneumonitis, started in Florida, when 5 infected horses in a
shipment from Germany arrived at the clinic on 29 Nov 2006.
Early signs of infection are unexplained fevers, weakness, problems
with coordination, altered behavior and possible trouble urinating.
The virus usually is transmitted through the respiratory system
through air and through nasal secretions.

5th horse dies in equine herpes outbreak
---------------------------------------------
A 5th horse in Florida died on Friday [22 Dec 2006] of equine herpes
(or EHV-1, equine rhinopneumontis) at Payson Park, a 500-horse
facility in Martin County, which is now under state quarantine; 9
other equine facilities are also under quarantine.
The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services believes
the horse was infected at Wellington's Palm Beach Equine Sports
Complex, the common link in all 10 of the known cases.
The department is looking at ways to properly dispose of manure
[contaminated with the virus], which can live in bedding and manure
for up to 28 days. It may be burned on site or removed to another
site for disposal.
The equestrian community in Ocala is concerned about the outbreak,
and state equine veterinarian Dr. Michael Short told a meeting late
last week that there were "a lot of rumors out there ... and most of
them are false."
The community is worried that panic over the virus in the region
could hurt the industry, which is worth more than USD 2 billion a
year in Florida.
