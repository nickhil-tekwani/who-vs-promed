["Lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV) is a poxvirus within the genus _Capripoxvirus_. It is genetically very similar to the other 2 _Capripoxvirus_ species Sheeppox virus and Goatpox virus. LSDV causes lumpy skin disease (LSD) in cattle and buffalo. LSD is a serious transboundary disease.

"The disease is endemic in southern Africa and becoming more prevalent in the northern half of the continent. Most importantly, the virus has recently spread out of Africa and through the Middle East into neighbouring areas. LSD was 1st identified in 2012 in Lebanon, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Turkey. The virus then spread north into Russia (Dagestan) in 2015 and Armenia in 2016, and east into Greece in 2015 and Bulgaria and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in 2016. It is widely expected to continue to spread;" https://www.pirbright.ac.uk/lumpyskin.

In addition to the current LSD case in Udmurt, according to the WAHID OIE database, Russia has an active event of LSD that started in June 2018 that has affected several administrative divisions. This event is still continuing, and through 28 Dec 2018, 64 outbreaks have been reported. The detailed information and an updated map are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=27254.
