While I have no specific knowledge of the ability of E. coli O157 to
proliferate during germination of cress seeds, I would like to point out
that there was a verified outbreak involving about 150 persons infected by
eating alfalfa sprouts contaminated with Salmonella newton in Denmark in 1995.
Also in 1995, there were outbreaks in Finland and in the USA caused by
Salmonella stanley in alfalfa sprouts, and a few years ago one in Sweden
caused by Salmonella bovismorbificans in, I think, bean sprouts.
It is well known that cress may be quite heavily contaminated with E. coli
other than O157. It therefore could be worth while investigating the "Oregon
connection", although it may be difficult to find conclusive evidence so
long after the outbreak.

Given the size of the Japan E. coli O157 outbreak, the apparently purely
circumstantial epidemiological evidence for the vehicle is indeed less than
convincing. It reminds me of the investigation on the source for the
Listeria monocytogenes outbreak in Switzerland in 1983-87, where preliminary
evidence had pointed to parsley as a vehicle. Thousands of laboratory
cultures for Listeria on diverse vegetables confirmed the presence of the
agent, but only more thorough investigation of the outbreak finally pointed
to the right source: soft cheese from unpasteurized milk.
What bothers me most about the alleged source of the Japan O157 outbreak is
the lack of any published data in the peer reviewed literature; so far I
read about it only in the news media and on the internet. Is anybody aware
of published evidence?

[In my experience one has to add water to get cress to germinate and grow.
It would be interesting to know what the water quality was found to be at
the Japanese cress farms before irrigation. AHEAD - Mod MHJ]
