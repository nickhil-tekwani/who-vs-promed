E.COLI O157 - JAPAN (4)
=======================
"The Ministry of Health and Welfare warned of the spread of the _E. coli_
O157 infection and advised the following precautions: _E.coli_ is sterilized
by 1 minute at 75 degrees centigrade. 1. Cook thoroughly if beef or pork meal
is suspected to be contaminated."
I wonder how doctors and public health authorities could believe that advice
such as this could be understood or practical. Imagine someone who cooks
hundreds of hamburgers each day carefully timing each one exactly one full
minute (no more, no less) with a thermometer in each one to cook them at 75
C. Americans would of course have to get out their high school science book
to convert to degrees Farenheit.
Also, in the case of E. coli O157:H7, as the infecton causes no clinical
signs in cattle (I doubt it causes signs in pigs either, if it has been found
in pork, which I believe it has).
It is better to give clear, practical advice that everyone can follow. For
example: "ALL meats must be cooked thoroughly for fear of zoonotic infections
(trichinosis, in pigs for example) and _E. coli_ O157:H7 or contaminants such
as _Salmonella_. One sure way to know if meat is well cooked is to wait
until the juices run clear (no red)."
Any other suggestions from food science experts?

[Moderator: Doubtful whether the Japanese Ministry of Health was giving
instructions to Americans but otherwise Raymond Whitham's suggestion is well
taken. No point in giving instructions to people who do not understand them.]
