MALARIA IN HIV-INFECTED SUBJECTS - AFRICA

For a long time it has not been clear whether HIV and malaria interacted. A
new study reported in the most recent issue of Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg
from Uganda clearly shows that malaria parasites are found with increasing
frequency as the CD4 white blood cell count decrease with progressing HIV
infection. The study found 21, 52 and 91 malaria cases per 1000 person
years in patients with CD4 T white blood cell counts of >500, 200 - 499
and <200 cells per microlitre respectively (P<0.01).

[The report is the first study showing a clear relationship between
uncomplicated malaria and HIV-infection in adults. Even a small increase in
malaria rates and densities as found here can significantly increase the
population burden of malaria in highly endemic areas like sub-Saharan Africa.
The impact on transmission is not known, but if HIV-infected subjects also
show higher gametocyte rates and densities or carry gametocytes for longer
periods, transmission may increase in areas with a high proportion of
HIV-infected persons. -Mod.EP]
