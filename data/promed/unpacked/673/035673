Further to the recent message from David Smith of the Perth Arbovirus
Reference lab, the Australian Military experience with dengue in East Timor
has been investigated as much as resources allow. The initial
investigations include field serology methods in Dili using visually read
ELISA plates. All clinical samples are confirmed in Australia using IgM
capture ELISA methods at the Army Malaria Institute and HAI
[hemagglutination-inhibition by Queensland Health Scientific Services. The
data is biased by collection of most cases from Dili with only more
clinically serious cases (requiring evacuation) from forward areas.
Consequently, it reflects an over-representation of the situation in Dili.
Nevertheless, we have seen a similar epidemiological picture to that
reported by David in terms of serotypes.
Our data was reported indirectly by Jim Black (WHO, Dili) in an early
message. In addition, we are undertaking serosurveillance of the soldiers
on return to Australia and at three months after return. This represents
more accurately the risk of dengue exposure across the areas Australian
soldiers are deployed. We hope to report this data presently, however,
initial observation supports expectations that more urban areas with poor
drainage carry the highest risk. Cases of dengue manifesting and viraemic
in Australia (State and Commonwealth notifiable disease here) have been
limited to 26 reported from arbovirus reference Labs including that of
David Smith, the Westmead Lab from Linda Heuston and QHSS from Greg Smith.
Notably, [dengue 2 virus is most commonly reported in these cases,
followed by [dengue 3 virus with minimal [dengue 1 virus and dengue 4
virus. This most likely directly represents the serotypes of Dili as
soldiers are concentrated here generally prior to re-deployment to
Australia. There have been no reported cases of local transmission from
these dengue case in Australia. This is most relevant in north Queensland
which is receptive to dengue.
