Multiple news articles [see links above] on [Mon 12 July 2021], reported that Anthrax has claimed the life of a wild elephant in a reserve forest area near Anaikatti in Coimbatore district, the Forest Department said on [Mon 12 July 2021]. The blood smear samples collected from the carcass had the presence of _Bacillus anthracis_, the bacterium that causes anthrax, senior officials said. With the test confirming the death by anthrax, the Forest and Animal Husbandry Departments will take measures to contain the spread of the infection.

The carcass of the female elephant, aged 13-15, was spotted by a patrol team in a forest area of the Anaikatti central beat of the Thudiyalur section of the Coimbatore forest range. A government veterinarian lifted the blood smear samples. Blood oozed from the anus and the mouth in a possible indication of anthrax infection. A. Sukumar, Forest Veterinary Officer, Coimbatore Forest Division, said the carcass would be destroyed on [Tue 13 Jul 2021], by deep burial or cremation, to prevent the spread of the infection.

The Department has asked frontline workers to monitor other elephants which had been roaming with the deceased elephant. I. Anwardeen, Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Coimbatore Circle), said the Coimbatore Forest Division would check with Kerala's Forest Department whether any case of anthrax was reported in that State recently because Anaikatti is located between Tamil Nadu and Kerala.

Anthrax is endemic to elephant habitats. Cross-infection may happen as head of cattle and wild animals use the same grazing areas and waterbodies on forest fringes.

The Animal Husbandry Department will conduct vaccination of cattle and goats in villages surrounding the forest area where the elephant was found dead. The Animal Disease Intelligence Unit, Coimbatore, is monitoring the situation.

District Forest Officer D. Venkatesh said four elephants had died of anthrax in the Coimbatore Forest Division in the past 10 years, and the last death was reported in December 2016.

[To see the previous elephant anthrax cases reported in Coimbatore in December 2016 see:
28 Dec 2016 Anthrax - India (30): (TN) elephants, susp. 20161228.4729069

Anthrax in elephants is not unusual and cases are seen in Africa and Asia. While elephants do graze they are mainly browsers. Blow flies feeding on an anthrax carcass will fly to the nearest bush, vomit, and then eat the blood corpuscles, thereby contaminating leaves within 10m of an anthrax carcass. Look for black spots on the leaves formed by the dry blood remaining. So when investigating elephant deaths one should first suspect a previous unobserved dead grazer, whether wildlife or cattle grazing in the park, which unfortunately is common. They will also be attracted by curiosity to a dead bloody livestock carcass, which they might find when exploring a nearby village to graze crops, and cause trouble. Livestock anthrax is regularly reported.

Proper disposal of a contaminated elephant carcass is very important as it has the potential to contaminate a significant amount of soil, both in spread and in depth. Frankly I don't know which is harder, burying a dead elephant or burning it. The Coimbatore Forest Division is to be congratulated in their intention and final efforts. And thanks to Mahmoud for assembling this report. - Mod.MHJ
