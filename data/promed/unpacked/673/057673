I will try a summary/translation.
A 33-year-old man fell ill at the end of his 3-week-long working visit to
Pakistan. He is regularly treated because of Crohn's disease. On 8 Apr 2001
he suffered from heavy, watery diarrhea, 20 to 40 times a day. He thinks a
fruit salad was the cause of his disease, because the salad "tasted not
OK". Back in Germany he went on 12 Apr 2001 to see his doctor at the
University of Wuerzburg, ("Gastroenterologische Ambulanz").
Laboratory testing showed _Aeromonas_ spp. and _V. cholerae_ O1 Biovar El
Tor, Serovar Ogawa. This diagnosis was confirmed on 4 May 2001 by the
National Referenzzentrum fuer Salmonellenn und andere bakterielle
Entertiserreger (Hygieninstitut Hamburg). Additionally they showed the gene
of cholera-toxin ctx to be present by PCR. The patient needed no
hospitalization, the disease developed no complications under treatment
with ciprofloxacin. Diarrhea continued after 2 days of treatment, [but
further stool specimens showed no _V. cholerae_.
