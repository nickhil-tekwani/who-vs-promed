Some 600 people have fallen victim to an epidemic of typhus, malaria and
other grave diseases in remote parts of Northeastern India's state of
Nagaland. The epidemic is ravaging the areas where the population is
practically deprived of the possibility to get medical attention. The local
authorities have confirmed the death of only 200 people of the diseases
rapidly spreading to other parts of the state. But the actual number of the
victims is much larger than officially reported, the local press said.

on the Burma border. Communications and medical services are rudimentary.
If anyone can confirm this report, we would be interested - Mod.JW]
