12 Dec 2015 Ghana-Cote d'Ivoire: 2 Ebola holding centres established at Gonokrom
http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Two-Ebola-Holding-Centres-established-at-Gonokrom-400276
[The Dormaa Municipal Health Service, in collaboration with the Dormaa Presbyterian Hospital, has opened 2 temporary Ebola holding centers at the Ghana-Cote d'Ivoire border. Because of the trade and commercial activities, which attract traders from both countries, the centers were established in those areas and satellite communities. Madam Florence Iddrisah, the Dormaa Municipal Health Directorate, said there are advanced plans for an isolation ward at the Dormaa Municipal hospital, and that support in financial or material terms was welcomed.]

12 Dec 2015 Liberia: Last batch of Ebola contacts in Liberia finishes quarantine
http://www.techtimes.com/articles/115728/20151212/last-batch-of-ebola-contacts-in-liberia-finishes-quarantine.htm
[On 11 Dec 2015, the quarantine of more than 160 possible Ebola contacts in Liberia ended. The surveillance was part of Liberia's efforts to ensure Ebola virus disease (EVD) does not spread any further following a reported EVD case.]

WHO
-------
[There is no new WHO situation report and no new cases or deaths have been reported in West Africa since the 9 Dec sitrep and statistics with data as of 6 Dec, reported in the previous ProMED Ebola update (133)]

12 Dec 1015: WHO releases its (to be) annual list of the 9 most dire epidemic threats
http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-who-releases-its-annual-list-of-the-nine-most-dire-epidemic-threats-2
[The initial list of disease priorities needing urgent research-and-development (R&D) attention include: Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), Ebola virus disease (EVD) and Marburg virus disease (MVD), Lassa hemorrhagic virus disease (LVHD), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV), and SARS (Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus diseases, Nipah virus disease (NiVD) and Rift Valley fever (RVFD). The list will be reviewed annually or when new diseases emerge. 3 other diseases were designated as 'serious' and requiring action by WHO (World Health Organization) to promote R&D as soon as possible. These were chikungunya virus disease (CHIVD), severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), and Zika virus disease (ZIKVD).

Other diseases with epidemic potential -- such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), tuberculosis, malaria, avian influenza and dengue -- were not included in the list because there are major disease control and research networks for these infections, and an existing pipeline for improved interventions.]

?? Dec 2015 Sierra Leone: Potential exposure to Ebola virus from body fluids due to ambulance compartment permeability
http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=10059412&utm_source=Issue_Alert&utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=PDM

Reference. Casey ML, Nguyen DT, et al. (December 2015). Potential exposure to Ebola virus from body fluids due to ambulance compartment permeability in Sierra Leone. _Prehospital and Disaster Medicine, Volume 30_, Issue 06, pp 625-627. http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1049023X15005294
[Many vehicles used by ambulance staff in Sierra Leone were not traditional ambulances, but were pick-up trucks or sport-utility vehicles that had been assembled or modified for patient transport. The wall separating the patient compartment and driver cabin in many vehicles did not have a waterproof seal around the edges. Waterproof separation between the patient compartment and driver cabin may be essential for patient transport vehicles in infectious disease outbreaks, especially when chlorine sprayers are used for decontamination or in resource-limited settings where cleaning supplies may be limited.]

Vaccination
---------

[Ring vaccination has been done on 4000 contacts, and none has developed EVD.]

Funding
-----
11 Dec 2015 UK: British Red Cross Ebola Outbreak Appeal has now closed with donations reaching nearly GBP 9 million [USD 13.7 million].
