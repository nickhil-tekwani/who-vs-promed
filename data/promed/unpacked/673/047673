Potomac horse fever: veterinarian says animals ill in St Lawrence County
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The north country may be seeing another outbreak of Potomac horse
fever, a life-threatening gastrointestinal disease.

Outbreaks of the disease occurred in St Lawrence and Jefferson
counties in 2001 and 2004.

Veterinarian Kirsten D Anderson of Lake Effect Veterinary Service,
Watertown, said that in St Lawrence County, she has treated "5 to 6
ill horses in the last 2 weeks."

She said she hasn't seen any cases yet this year [2010] in Jefferson
County. Infected horses may experience fever, depression,
miscarriages, rapid weight loss, and a painful inflammation of the
hooves, which often can be crippling. Severe diarrhea also can occur,
which could cause deadly dehydration if not treated.

The disease is believed to be transmitted when a horse accidentally
ingests insects such as mayflies that are carrying a parasite known
as _Neorickettsia risticii_. Snails and slugs are also a problem,
since they can carry the parasite in their slime.

These pests thrive near water, which is a particular problem for the
north country. Wet weather mixed with the area's abundance of rivers
leaves huge swaths of the area susceptible to transmission.

"Having the wet season and then going so hot was definitely a
breeding ground," said Corey M Hayes, farm business management
educator for Cornell Cooperative Extension of Jefferson County.

To reduce the chances of a horse becoming infected, it is important
to make sure water buckets and feeding areas are clean, Mr Hayes
said. Covering food also is a good way to reduce the chances of
accidental ingestion of insects or other carriers.

It also is important to check on horses daily because of the quick
onset of symptoms. Potomac horse fever has an incubation period of 10
days. "Horses in pasture must be checked every day," Dr Anderson
said. She said that if a horse gets diarrhea, it could die of
dehydration within a matter of days.

Treatment of infected horses should begin as soon as symptoms are
noticed. Treatment with antibiotics costs an average of USD 500 to
USD 2000. Sick horses also are given fluids to help with dehydration.

Tetracycline antibiotics, such as doxycycline, are commonly used to
treat the disease because of their effectiveness in killing the
parasite. A vaccine also is available that greatly reduces the chance
of infection.

"Vaccination is key," Mr Hayes said. "A USD 15 vaccination is a lot
cheaper than USD 1500 for supportive care."

[Potomac horse fever (PHF) is an acute enterocolitis syndrome
producing mild colic, fever, and diarrhea in horses of all ages, as
well as abortion in pregnant mares. The causative agent, formerly
known as _Ehrlichia risticii_, has recently been renamed
_Neorickettsia risticii_ because of its lesser genetic relationships
to other _Ehrlichia_ groups. The infection of enterocytes of the
small and large intestine results in acute colitis, which is one of
the principal clinical signs of PHF. The disease is seen in spring,
summer, and early fall and is associated with pastures bordering
creeks or rivers. Recently, the epidemiology of PHF has been shown to
involve a trematode vector. Sporadic disease caused by _N. risticii_
has been reported in dogs and cats; cattle appear to be resistant to
infection. PHF has been reported in many areas of the USA and Canada
using an indirect fluorescent antibody test as evidence of exposure;
however, recent studies indicate a high rate of false-positive titers
with this test, and the true geographic range of distribution is not
known. Isolation or detection of the causative agent from clinical
cases of PHF using conventional cell culture or PCR assay has been
reported only from California, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland,
Michigan, New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas,
and Virginia.

_N. risticii_ is a gram-negative obligate intracellular bacterium
with a trophism for monocytes. Initial morphologic studies of this
organism isolated from cell culture, as well as the serologic
responses of _N risticii_, caused this bacterium to be assigned to
the genus _Ehrlichia_. Recent DNA analyses have revealed _N.
risticii_ is most closely related to _N. helminthoeca_ , the agent of
salmon poisoning in dogs, and _Ehrlichia sennetsu_, a disease of
humans in Japan. The organism is not visible in monocytes in blood
films from clinical cases in contrast to _Ehrlichia (Anaplasma) equi_
, which is readily identifiable in granulocytes of infected horses.

Recently _N. risticii_ has been identified in freshwater snails and
isolated from trematodes released from the snails. _N. risticii_ DNA
was detected in 13 species of immature and adult caddisflies
(_Trichoptera_), mayflies (_Ephemeroptera_), damselflies (_Odonata_,
_Zygoptera_), dragonflies (_Odonata_, _Anisoptera_), and stoneflies
(_Plecoptera_). Transmission studies using _N. risticii_-infected
caddisflies have reproduced the clinical disease. One route of
exposure is believed to be inadvertent ingestion of aquatic insects
that carry _N. risticii_ in the metacercarial stage of a trematode.
The incubation period is about 10-18 days. The causative organism is
present in the feces of experimentally infected horses, but the
biologic significance of this is unknown. Clinically ill horses are
not contagious and can be housed with susceptible horses. Future
studies are needed to determine the exact role of the vector and
helminth hosts in the complex maintenance cycle of _N. risticii_.

The clinical features of PHF are typified initially by mild
depression and anorexia, followed by a fever ranging from 102-107 deg
F (38.9-41.7 deg C). At this stage, intestinal sounds can be
decreased. Within 24-48 hours, a moderate to severe diarrhea, with
feces ranging in consistency from that usually seen in cows to
watery, develops in approximately 60 percent of affected horses. The
onset of diarrhea is often accompanied by mild abdominal discomfort.
Some horses develop severe toxemia and dehydration. Laminitis can
supervene as a severe complication of PHF in up to 40 percent of
affected horses. Hematologic findings vary in the early stage of PHF
from leukopenia (characterized by neutropenia and lymphopenia) to a
normal hemogram, despite evidence of systemic toxicity. A common
finding in cases of PHF is a marked leukocytosis, which is normally
observed within a few days of onset. PHF may present with all or any
combination of these clinical signs.

Several months following clinical disease in pregnant mares, abortion
due to fetal infection with _N. risticii_ may occur. Experimentally,
pregnant mares infected at 100-160 days of gestation abort at 190-250
days of gestation. The abortion is accompanied by placentitis and
retained placenta. Fetal lesions include colitis, periportal
hepatitis, and lymphoid hyperplasia of mesenteric lymph nodes and
spleen. Necropsy findings in nonpregnant horses with enterocolitis
are nonspecific and reveal diffuse inflammation, mainly in the large
intestines.

Diagnosis
---------
A provisional diagnosis of PHF often is based on the presence of
typical clinical signs and the seasonal and geographic occurrence of
the disease. A definitive diagnosis of PHF should be based on
isolation or detection of _N. risticii_ from the blood or feces of
infected horses. Serologic testing is of limited value as a
diagnostic tool, although many infected horses have high antibody
titers at the time of infection. Because of the high prevalence of
false-positive titers, interpretation of the indirect fluorescent
antibody test in individual horses is difficult. Isolation of the
agent in cell culture, although possible, is time-consuming and not
routinely available in many diagnostic laboratories. A recently
developed real-time PCR assay allows the detection of _N. risticii_
DNA within 2 hours, making this a much more feasible test for routine
diagnostic examination. To enhance the chances of detection of _N.
risticii_, the assay should be performed on a blood as well as a
fecal sample, as the presence of the organism in blood and feces may
not necessarily coincide.

Treatment
---------
PHF can be treated successfully with oxytetracycline (6.6 mg/kg, IV,
bid), if given early in the clinical course of the disease. A
response to treatment is usually seen within 12 hours. This is
associated with a drop in rectal temperature, followed by an
improvement in demeanor, appetite, and borborygmal sounds. If therapy
is begun early, clinical signs frequently resolve by the 3rd day of
treatment. Generally, antimicrobial therapy is for no more than 5
days. In animals exhibiting signs of enterocolitis, fluids and NSAID
(nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) should be administered.
Laminitis, if it develops, is usually severe and often refractory to treatment.

Prevention
----------
Several inactivated, whole-cell vaccines based on the same strain of
_N. risticii_ are commercially available. Although vaccination has
been reported to protect 78 percent of experimentally infected
ponies, it has been marginally protective in the field. Vaccine
failure has been attributed to antigenic and genomic heterogeneity
among the more than 14 different strains of _N. risticii_ isolates
from naturally occurring cases. Furthermore, vaccine failure may also
be due to lack of antibody protection at the site of exposure,
because the natural route of transmission has been determined to be
oral ingestion of the agent. Reduction of snail numbers in rivers and
ditches may be attempted to lessen sources of infection. No zoonotic
risk is known.
