Crop disease warning goes out to Saskatchewan canola farmers
------------------------------------------------------------
Canola farmers in Saskatchewan have been told to be on high alert
against a crop disease called clubroot. More than 60 canola fields
were infected last year [2007] in the neighboring province of
Alberta, which experienced severely reduced canola yields.

The Saskatchewan agriculture ministry described clubroot as "harmful
and swift-moving." Clubroot has not been detected in Saskatchewan,
but farmers have been told that it is "extremely important" for
producers to prevent the crop disease before it becomes entrenched
and begins to spread. Saskatchewan growers are expected to seed up to
7.5 million acres (about 3 million ha) of canola this year [2008],
and the province anticipates a record crop, according to the Eastern
Edition of Country Guide.

Clubroot, a soil-borne disease, affects the roots of cruciferous
vegetables and crops such as cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, brussels
sprouts, turnip, rutabaga, radish, canola, and mustard. Cruciferous
weeds such as stinkweed, shepherd's-purse, and wild mustard can also
host the disease. Clubroot is mainly spread by soil movement
containing soil-borne spores. Soil transport can occur by wind or
water erosion, in manure from animals fed contaminated feed, and by
earth tag on seed or on field machinery, the province said.

Dr Ron Howard, research and extension specialist with the Crop
Diversification Centre in Brooks, Alberta advises producers to scout
fields regularly for clubroot. Producers should also prevent the
introduction of the pathogen into fields by thoroughly cleaning their
farm equipment.

Clubroot hitchhikes from field to field
---------------------------------------
Bob Wasieczko got more than he paid for at a recent auction sale. He
believes the air seeder he bought likely has spores from clubroot, a
serious canola disease.

The Thorsby, Alberta, farmer bought the air seeder from an auction
near Leduc and he knows the farmer had clubroot on at least 5
quarters of land, but he didn't think about that until after he
bought the machine.

[Clubroot of _Brassicaceae_ is caused by the fungus _Plasmodiophora
brassicae_. It is a destructive soil-borne disease which affects
nearly all cultivated, as well as many wild and weed members of this
family. A number of non-brassicaceous hosts are also known, but
clubbing of roots does not occur on these. The pathogen is found
worldwide and is most damaging in temperate regions and tropical
highlands. It enters root hairs and wounded roots and multiplies
rapidly, causing abnormal enlargement of the underground stem,
taproot, or secondary roots. These roots often decay before the crop
has matured, releasing many resting spores, which can survive for a
decade in the absence of a susceptible host plant. Affected plants
are stunted and may have discoloured purple leaves. Due to the
distortion of the root, plants may wilt in dry weather and then
recover at night.

The fungus has a complex disease cycle and is spread with
contaminated soil, plant material, water, and by human activities.
Disease management is difficult due to the longevity of the spores
and the inaccessibility of underground plant parts to fungicides.
Raising soil pH by addition of lime has been shown to be effective
but the reasons are unknown and it is hardly practicable on large
fields. Use of clean planting material is essential. The pathogen
includes numerous pathotypes which have hampered efforts to breed
cultivars with durable resistance.

In Canada, clubroot on canola was detected for the 1st time in
Alberta in 2003 where it has been spreading since (see recent
ProMED-mail post no. 20080407.1272). At least 2 prevalent pathotypes
have been reported in Alberta to date, and a new more virulent strain
of the pathogen appears to have emerged recently. There is a real
risk of these fungal races spreading to neighbouring provinces, as
illustrated by item [2] above. Although different strains are
reported to affect different hosts to varying degrees, the
possibility of local spread between different susceptible brassica
crops may need further investigation.
