Measles are on the rise with more cases reported in Essex than this time last year [2017]. There were 183 suspected cases of measles reported in England and Wales.

There have been 6 cases of measles reported in the county this January [2018], compared to 4 in the same period last year [2017].

In the 4 weeks of the month (up until 28 Jan 2018), there were 6 suspected cases of the viral illness reported to Public Health England (PHE) in the area.

Four cases were reported in 2016 and 5 in 2015.

While not all of the suspected cases may turn out to be measles, the number of reports is higher than in the same period of the previous 2 years, PHE reports.

Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunization at PHE, said: "This serves as an important reminder for parents to take up the offer of MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] vaccination for their children at 1 year of age, and as a pre-schooler booster at 3 years and 4 months of age.

"Children and young adults who missed out on their MMR vaccine in the past or are unsure if they had 2 doses should contact their GP practice to catch-up." ...

[2] United Kingdom (west London): alert

West London measles warning as nearly 200 cases recorded by Public Health England nationwide. 7 suspected cases of measles have been reported in west London during the 1st month of 2018 alone.

Public Health England (PHE) is warning people to be vigilant after a significant spike across the country at the start of the year.

Nearly 200 cases have been recorded nationally.

The number of suspected cases in west London is up from 6 during the same period last year [2017].

While not all cases were confirmed to be measles, in the 1st 4 weeks of 2018, there were 2 cases reported in Kensington and Chelsea and 2 more in Ealing.

On top of this, there was one case reported each in Hillingdon, Hounslow, and Hammersmith and Fulham.

According to PHE, this number is higher than in the same period for the previous 2 years.

Across England and Wales, 183 suspected cases of measles were reported within the 1st 4 weeks. This is higher than in the same period in the previous 2 years, when 86 cases were reported in 2016/17 and 98 in 2015/16.

There was a major measles outbreak in England and Wales between November 2012 and July 2013, primarily concentrated in Wales but with high numbers of cases in the north of England.

"The UK recently achieved WHO measles elimination status and so the overall risk of measles to the UK population is low.

"However, due to ongoing measles outbreaks in Europe, we will continue to see cases in unimmunised individuals and limited onward spread can occur in communities with low MMR coverage and in age groups with very close mixing."

Complications from measles, including pneumonia, are common and the death rate is approximately one in 5000 cases in the UK.

The HSE [Health Service Executive] has confirmed an outbreak of measles in Limerick this Wednesday afternoon [31 Jan 2018].

The HSE stated that 4 cases were confirmed in Limerick city since [3 Jan 2018], and that this number "constitutes an outbreak of the disease."

"An Outbreak Control Team made up of representatives from the HSE are involved in managing the outbreak in an effort to prevent further spread," a spokesperson stated.

Measles is a virus that is spread through direct contact and through the air. "It is highly contagious and is spread easily. One case of measles can infect 15-20 unvaccinated people. While the numbers of cases of measles in Ireland has reduced dramatically since the introduction of the measles vaccine, it remains a significant cause of death among young children worldwide.

Hundreds of additional measles cases have been reported in Greece during the past month, according to Greek health officials data. As of [1 Feb 2018], The Hellenic Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (KEELPNO) put the case tally at 1362 (775 confirmed, 475 probable, and 112 possible) since last year [2017]. This is up from 922 cases reported one month ago.

The highest frequency has been observed in South Greece. It concerns people of Greek nationality (mainly young Roma children, as well as Greek adults mainly aged 25-44 years old) susceptible to measles, among them healthcare professionals who were unvaccinated or partly vaccinated.

Two deaths have been reported in laboratory confirmed measles cases. The 1st case concerned an 11-month-old unvaccinated Roma infant, with underlying dystrophy, who died of septicemia. The 2nd case concerned a 17-year-old unvaccinated Roma, who died of encephalitis.

Vaccination with the combined measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is recommended for children, adolescents, and adults who have not been vaccinated with the appropriate doses. According to the National Immunization Program, children, adolescents and adults who were born after 1970 and have no evidence of immunity should receive 2 doses of measles containing vaccine.

[5] Caribbean (Cayman Islands) and Central America ex Europe: travel alert
Date: Fri 2 Feb 2018

The [Cayman Islands] Public Health Department is issuing an alert for travellers after at least 2 cases of measles were confirmed in the Caribbean and Central America that appear to have been imported from Europe. There have been no cases of measles in the Cayman Islands since 1990. Local immunisation coverage against the disease is around 90% among 15-month-old children and about 97% by the time they reach school age. But officials are urging anyone who becomes unwell after returning from the UK and Europe as well as parts of the US to visit a doctor.

People who are experiencing a sudden high fever accompanied by a rash should seek medical attention immediately and provide their travel history to the doctor for necessary investigation.

"If you are travelling to any of the affected areas where measles has been confirmed, safeguard yourself and your family by ensuring that your and your children's immunisations against measles are up to date," advised Nurse Angela Graham, manager of the Health Services Authority's Expanded Programme on Immunisation. "Unprotected children are at the greatest risk of contracting this virus, should a case be imported to the Cayman Islands. It is the responsibility of parents and guardians, alike, to ensure that their children are protected."

Dr Samuel Williams-Rodriguez, Acting Medical Officer of Health, said that while there has been great progress in the fight against measles regionally, there is a risk of spread and sustained transmission in areas with susceptible populations.

"Vaccination with at least 2 doses remains the most effective measure," he said. "I emphasise that measles can be reintroduced as we have many residents and visitors travelling to and from the Americas and European countries. We should therefore remain vigilant."

He added, "The 1st sign of measles is usually a high fever which begins about 10-12 days after exposure to the virus. A runny nose, cough, along with red and watery eyes and small white spots inside the cheeks, can develop in the initial stage followed by a rash on the face and upper neck, eventually reaching the hands and feet."

Measles is caused by a virus which grows in the cells that line the back of the throat and lungs. It is a human disease and is not known to occur in animals. Close contact with other people following the onset of rash must be avoided 7 for days.

For complete protection, children older than 12 months should have 2 doses of MMR (measles mumps and rubella) vaccine. Children between 6 and 11-months, who are travelling abroad, are recommended to have one dose of MMR vaccine.
