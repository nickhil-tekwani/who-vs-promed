Island Soups Company, Inc. of Saint Albans, NY is recalling several soup varieties because they have the potential to be contaminated with _Clostridium botulinum_ or botulism, a bacterium which can cause life-threatening illness or death.

Consumers are warned not to use these products:

GUNGO PEAS SOUP, NET WT. 16OZ
GUNGO PEAS SOUP NO MEAT, NET WT. 16OZ
RED PEAS SOUP, NET WT. 16OZ
RED PEAS SOUP NO MEAT, NET WT. 16OZ
MANNISH WATER, NET WT. 16OZ
FISH SOUP, NET WT. 16OZ

Botulism, a potentially fatal form of food poisoning, can cause the following symptoms: general weakness, dizziness, double-vision, and trouble with speaking or swallowing, according to the FDA. Difficulty in breathing, weakness of other muscles, abdominal distention and constipation may also be common symptoms. People experiencing these problems should seek immediate medical attention.

Products were distributed through internet website purchases. The products are packaged in 16 oz. glass jars with white lids and a white plastic with brown lettering safety seal. There have been no confirmed reports of illness and injury related to these products.

FDA inspection of the establishment revealed that the firm does not have valid process schedules or process documentation to ensure that these soup products have been sufficiently processed to prevent the growth of _Clostridium botulinum_.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures that could, but do not necessarily, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_. - Mod.LL
