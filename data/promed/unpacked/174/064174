State Public Health officials have reported that 21 cases of _E. coli_
have been reported as of Thursday afternoon [27 Oct 2011].

Of those 21 cases, 8 are confirmed, and 13 cases are still being
evaluated. All reported cases either reside or traveled to Wake County
10 days prior to becoming ill.

According to State Epidemiologist Dr. Megan Davies, cases have been
reported from Durham, Wake, Johnston, Franklin, Cleveland and Sampson
counties. "There does not appear to be any reason to be concerned
about ongoing exposure to the source of this outbreak," Davies said.
"However, we are working vigorously with local health departments and
health care providers across the state to find additional cases if
they exist."

Four of the 21 cases are still hospitalized, and all those
hospitalized are children, she added.

The initial investigation was undertaken by Wake County Health and
Human Services, Wake County Environmental Services, and by the North
Carolina Division of Public Health. Other Local Health Departments are
joining this investigation if cases are reported to them.
Investigators are examining events, foods or activities that may be
common to all cases. State and Wake County Health officials stressed
that the investigation is ongoing.

"We are working with county health departments, hospitals and clinics
across the state to identify any additional cases," Davies said. "Once
a case is identified, disease investigators then work to determine
whether the case is related to this outbreak and, if so, what common
link there may be as to the source. Our focus at this time is to
conduct a case control study and to genetically fingerprint this
strain so as to determine cases that are related to the same source."

[In one day, the number of cases in this cluster has grown from 9 to
21. It has not been specifically reported in these postings whether
the outbreak organism is truly _E. coli_ O157 or a non-O157
enterohemorrhagic pathotype. It has also not been reported whether the
additional cases also had links to the NC State Fair as almost all of
the initial cases did. ProMED awaits the formal characterization of
the organism as well as data on the vehicle transmitting the pathogen.
