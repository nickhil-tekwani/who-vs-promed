To date, a total of 255 mortalities have been detected in the current outbreak in the Mackenzie bison herd. 225 of the cases have been attended to, with the remainder to be done over the next little while. No new cases have been reported in the initial outbreak area at Mills Lake, with some new cases detected at Mink Lake and Slavey Point, areas detected later in the outbreak.

Crews continue to work tirelessly to actively deal with the outstanding cases. Will try to provide an additional update shortly.

[Mink Lake is some 44 km north of Mills Lake, and Slavey Point is 35 km southeast of Falaise Lake and 122 km east of Mills Lake. As you can appreciate from these new outlying sites, the epidemic has increased not just in numbers affected but also in the area affected. At the very end of the 1993 epidemic around Falaise Lake, some 5 dead bison were found at Mink Lake in the final search for cases. That the "hot-shot" teams have already burnt 225/255 carcasses discovered is a very sound indication of their competence, efficiency, and enthusiasm. Wood bison are big animals, some 10 plus percent bigger than Plains bison. If you are still unimpressed, I suggest that you visit the area via Google Earth to get a better idea of what the burn crews are contending with.

Our heartfelt thanks to Brett for this update. - Mod.MHJ]
