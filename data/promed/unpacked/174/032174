VERNAL (Utah): Health officials say soil-transmitted fungal pneumonia may
be the cause of a flu-like illness that struck a group of trail volunteers
at Dinosaur National Monument Sunday. There were 16 people doing volunteer
work at the monument, half of them digging in an Indian sweat cave off the
monument's main road and the other half working on the quarter-mile trail
leading to the cave, called the "Swelter Shelter."
The 8 volunteers, including one from inside the cave and 7 from the trail,
were taken to Ashley Valley Medical Center in Vernal. All but 2 were
released Tuesday, according to Joseph B. Shaffer, director of the
Tri-County Health Department, which is investigating the mysterious
illness. The 2 still in the hospital are being held for observation at
least through Wednesday.
Health officials ruled out bubonic plague, hantavirus [infection, and
deer-fly bites [which are known to transmit tularemia as possible causes.
The volunteers have been treated for fungal and bacterial infection,
Shaffer said. The fungal infection comes from the soil, with no possible
person-to-person transmission.
All 16 of the volunteers who became ill high school graduates and college
students were from outside the area. They came from Alaska, Florida,
Kansas, Vermont, Virginia, and one from Poland. Volunteers from Utah and
Colorado were not affected. "My suspicion is we develop a lot of immunities
to things that knock people out who are not living here," Shaffer said.
The investigation team includes representatives from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention and local and state health officials. None
of the young adults is in danger, said Shaffer, who praised the "great
cooperation" between the hospital and public health officials in launching
an immediate investigation.

[The preceding article does not specify the clinical syndromes other than
to mention "flu-like illness" and suggest the involvement of a fungal
etiology. Histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, and blastomycosis are
illnesses that present with flu-like symptoms, and are infections with
dimorphic fungi found in the soil in the USA, and could be responsible for
these outbreaks.
Histoplasmosis is caused by _Histoplasma capsulatum_ . According to Gideon
<http://www.gideononline.com>: histoplasmosis was first reported in the
United States in 1926. The disease is endemic to the Ohio, Mississippi, and
Missouri River valley areas, with highest rates in Kentucky, Illinois,
Indiana, Missouri, Ohio, and Tennessee. Although the endemic area for
blastomycosis overlaps that of histoplasmosis, blastomycosis is also found
further north, and not as far to the west as histoplasmosis. In 1969, it
was estimated that 40 million Americans were infected [with
histoplasmosis, with 200 000 cases of acute pulmonary disease per year.
Skin test-positivity rates approach 95% in areas of South Kentucky and
Middle Tennessee; 80% to 90% in Kansas City (adults over age 20, 1963).
Coccidioidomycosis is caused by _Coccidioides immitis_. According to
Gideon: Coccidioidomycosis was first reported in the United States in 1893:
The disease is most common in California (the San Joaquin Valley), Arizona,
Texas, New Mexico, southern Nevada, and Utah. The highest incidence occurs
in late summer and early fall -- large outbreaks frequently follow dust
storms. An estimated 100 000 infections occur in the United States
annually, and 1 in 200 infections progresses to disseminated disease.
Blastomycosis is caused by _Blastomyces dermatitidis_. Most cases are
reported from Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South
Carolina, and Wisconsin. Infection was first reported in Colorado in 1998.
Although the endemic area for blastomycosis overlaps that of
histoplasmosis, blastomycosis is also found further north, and not as far
to the west as histoplasmosis.
By geographic distribution, coccidioidomycosis would be the highest on the
list as possible etiologies followed by blastomycosis and then
histoplasmosis. Additional information on this outbreak would be
appreciated. - Mod.MPP
[While we are putting forward our best guesses, the history of cave
exploration is of interest. Cave-associated histoplasmosis is well known to
occur among spelunkers exposed to bat excreta. - Man. Ed. DS
