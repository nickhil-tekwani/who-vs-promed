A national outbreak of hepatitis A linked to frozen pomegranates grown overseas has spread to Western Australia. It follows 5 cases of the infection in NSW, 1 in the ACT and 1 in Queensland, the WA Health Department says.

Anyone who has purchased Creative Gourmet Frozen Pomegranate Aril from Coles is urged to throw it out or seek a refund. Fresh pomegranate and Australian grown frozen pomegranate products remain edible.

Symptoms of the virus include fever, nausea, loss of appetite, diarrhoea, abdominal discomfort, yellowing of the whites of the eyes and skin, dark urine and pale stools.

WA Communicable Disease Control director Paul Armstrong said anyone who developed symptoms should see a doctor. "Symptoms can take 2 to 7 weeks to develop after eating contaminated food," he said. "People can also become infected from being in contact with infected people and drinking water contaminated with the virus."

[Imported fruit, particularly berries, have been implicated in hepatitis A transmission in Australia in the past as well as in the USA and Europe.

The fruit of the pomegranates (_Punica granatum_) when split open reveals clusters of juicy, gem-like seeds (anils) on the inside and can be seen in a picture at https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomegranate.
