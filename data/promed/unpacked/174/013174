[1] Comment regarding long-term sequelae
Date: Sun 13 Mar 2016
From: Brett Sutton <drbsutton@gmail.com> [edited]


Regarding PRO/AH/EDR> Ebola update (22): long-term sequelae, news, the research reported by the American Association of Neurologists is very important and timely. It also highlights the critical need for further research.

Although there are clearly objective signs of persistent neurological sequelae in some patients (how many is not quantified in the post), it is notable that the commonest reported symptoms (in a majority of patients) have significant overlap with those associated with post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD]. It would be of great value if a specific study investigating the prevalence of PTSD could be undertaken. Such symptoms and signs as insomnia, anxiety, hypervigilance, avoidance, nightmares and Impact of Events Scale (IES) might help to clarify whether some of the reported neurological symptoms may in fact be those of PTSD. Reports of a prevalence of PTSD up to at least 25% for survivors of an ICU admission or critical illness have been reported. See: http://hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/ptsd_common_in_icu_survivors.

In addition, the stressors of home quarantine, widespread fear, ostracism as well as family and community deaths are all likely to play a role in contributing to PTSD. Research into PTSD in West African Ebola survivors would be extremely useful in determining strategies to help prevent or reduce psychological sequelae should another Ebola or similar epidemic ever tragically occur.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Sutton for his comment raising the possibility of post-traumatic stress disorder as the cause for the neurologic symptoms observed in Ebola virus disease survivors. He raises a possible alternative explanation for the long-term sequelae. Certainly, research needs to be conducted to clarify causation of these persisting health problems following recovery from Ebola virus disease, and causes other than the virus itself must be considered. - Mod.LK]

[2] West Africa: Ebola in pregnant women

Liberia's Health Minister Dr. Bernice Dahn says pregnant women and girls were most affected by the social upset that was created by Ebola during the outbreak that did not only cripple an already devastated health system in Liberia but also eroded the confidence in the health care delivery system. She said that since the declaration of an Ebola free Liberia, many pregnant women and girls are still reluctant to seek care in the health care delivery system, something she said is a major challenge for Liberia's health sector.

Dr. Dahn said: "The Ebola outbreak did not only cripple an already devastated system in our country health care delivery system, it also eroded the confidence in the health care delivery system. Pregnant women and girls were most affected by the social upset of this. So, up to today [15 Mar 2016], there are many pregnant women and girls who are still reluctant to seek care in the health care delivery system."

The Ministry survey conducted by international groups after the Ebola outbreak shows that the death rate in pregnant women from Ebola during the outbreak was even higher than the general population. "The World Bank also recently estimated that maternal mortality will increase, and for our country, they projected 111% more than what it is currently, or 1072 per 100 000 live births," she said.

Making remarks at a 2-day Mano River Maternal Health Response sub-regional coordination meeting, she said that the meeting of Mano River Union countries is an opportunity for member countries to come together to share experiences for providing maternal health care during emergency situations. "It caught us unaware; it is a gender issue, but we believe we have learned some lessons that we can build on, especially when there are emergencies for women. We also learned that the lesson learnt can also be taken into our general program for women's health," she added. ...more

[The Mano River is a river in West Africa; it originates in the Guinea Highlands in Liberia and forms part of the Liberia-Sierra Leone border. The districts through which the river flows include the Parrot's Beak area of Guinea, Liberia's Lofa County and the Kono and Kailahun District of Sierra Leone. Thus, the river flows through the 3 countries most recently affected by Ebola, leading to the name of the women's initiative.

This meeting led to a midwifery response initiative to share lessons and other pertinent information across the countries struck by Ebola. It is important to build a path forward to strengthen the health system, not only to strengthen maternal health care but also to increase detection of infectious diseases in the population (see brief report below). Rebuilding the maternal health system in the 3 countries by working together is an important step in the right direction to rebuild the public health infrastructure. - Mod.LK]

16 Mar 2016 Liberia: As Ebola wanes, a spike in infectious diseases sweeps through Liberia.
http://www.statnews.com/2016/03/16/liberia-tuberculosis-after-ebola/
[The impact of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic can be seen at health clinics in Liberia: running water is sporadic, drugs are in short supply, and the medical system is still struggling. In addition, Liberia is now recording a spike in cases of tuberculosis and other treatable infections. In this setting, health facilities' ability to deal with treatable diseases, such as tuberculosis, is compromised.

March 2016 WHO: Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone "effectively managing" Ebola flare-ups
http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/managing-flare-ups/en/
[EXCERPT:
..."WHO [World Health Organization] believes that all original chains of transmission in the epidemic have been halted, but it continues to stress that small flare-ups are anticipated due to virus persistence in the fluids and tissues of some survivors. While the risk is declining as the virus clears from survivors, it still necessitates a strong surveillance and response capacity, including the ability to detect new and suspect cases, rapid diagnosis, case isolation and management, contact tracing, community awareness and participation, safe burials and care, counseling and screening for survivors." ...more]

15 Mar 2016 Russia: Ebola treatment medication developed in Russia -- Ministry of Healthcare http://tass.ru/en/society/862427
[A medication for treating the Ebola [virus disease] has been developed in Russia; the research will be completed in the near future, Russian Healthcare Minister Veronika Skvortsova told reporters on Tue [15 Mar 2016].

"At the preliminary stages, it shows a very high efficiency, making it possible to interrupt the infection process and, consequently, improve the survival rate of the primates that have been infected with Ebola," she said...-more]

15 Mar 2016 UK: Tiny fluorescent crystals help Leeds University scientists understand spread of HIV and Ebola viruses
http://bit.ly/1QYECWa
["Excerpt:
Scientists have used tiny fluorescent crystals to observe for the 1st time how HIV and Ebola viruses attach to cells to spread infection. The findings offer a new way of treating such viruses: instead of destroying the pathogens, [they might] introduce a block on how they interact with cells."

"'Lead author Dr Yuan Guo, from Leeds University's Astbury Centre for Structural Molecular Biology said: "Until now, how these viruses attach to cells was a 'black box' to chemists. We knew that the viruses were interacting with healthy cells, but the way in which they bound together was still a mystery.'"

The researchers used nano-sized crystals, about a millionth of a mm in size, called 'quantum dots,' that mimicked the shape of the viruses and acted as technological stand-ins in experiments to reveal how they bind to cells.]
