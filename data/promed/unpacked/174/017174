In Spain, "_Candidatus_ Liberibacter solanacearum" haplotype E, which was so far only recorded in Apiaceae, has been detected in potatoes (_Solanum tuberosum_). The bacterium was found in Cantabria [Autonomous Community] in 2 potato stores in December 2016.

[Only a few members of _Candidatus_ Liberibacter have been characterised so far, including the pathogens causing citrus greening (huanglongbing, HLB; for more information see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives). HLB, one of the most damaging diseases of citrus, is limited to these crops due to the host specificity of its vector, the citrus psyllid.

A new liberibacter species was found to be associated with zebra chip (ZC) and psyllid yellows (PY) diseases of potato, as well as a new yellowing disease of tomato and capsicum crops in New Zealand. The new pathogen was given the preliminary name of _Ca._ Liberibacter solanacearum (Lso; synonym _Ca._ L. psyllaurous). Lso has since also been associated with yellowing diseases of other solanaceous crops (physalis, tomatillo, aubergine, tamarillo, tobacco) and some crops in the family Apiaceae (carrot, celery). Main vectors of Lso are the potato psyllid (_Bactericera cockerelli_) in solanaceous host and carrot psyllids (_Trioza apicalis_, _Bactericera trigonica_) in Apiaceae. These vectors have a much wider host range than the HLB vector and additional vector species are also being identified, further extending potential host range and economic impact of Lso.

Currently the Lso species is divided into 5 haplotypes: A and B affecting Solanaceae; and C, D and E affecting Apiaceae. Both groups of haplotypes have been reported from the Americas and New Zealand. Carrot haplotypes have previously been reported from several European countries (ProMED-mail posts 20120713.1199961, 20151009.3702151 & 20161130.4666613), northern Africa (ProMED-mail post 20141121.2978030) and the Middle East (ProMED-mail post 20170130.4803773).

Potato haplotypes A & B are still considered absent from the European/Mediterranean region. The item above represents the first report of potatoes being affected by Lso in Europe, as well as the first report of a haplotype being able to affect both Apiaceae and Solanaceae. It is not stated, however, whether typical zebra chip symptoms were observed in the potatoes infected with haplotype E. Nevertheless, these findings add important information to the knowledge of epidemiology, biology and distribution of Lso worldwide.

Further updates on Lso distribution and hosts can also be found at the source above.
