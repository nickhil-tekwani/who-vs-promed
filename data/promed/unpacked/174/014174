It was thought that the disease had been eliminated, but this is not
the case. Measles reappeared, though it is hitting again with great
strength. The last outbreak that occurred in Catalonia affected 89
people in the last quarter of 2006: more than twice the total case
toll recorded all over Spain in 2004. Figures are striking. The virus
was quite unusual, so World Health Organization aimed to eradicate it
in Europe this year. However, this will not be possible. Continuing
migratory flow makes diseases that were thought to have been
eliminated hit industrialized countries again, since, just as it
happened in Madrid and Rioja, the virus had been "imported."
The exact number of measles cases in 2006 is not known. Official
reports recorded cases up to last May, but when adding such figures
to the Catalonia report, the current number of cases is 3 times the
figure for 2005.
There is no antimicrobial able to fight measles, therefore the only
measure to be taken is to put forward immunization for babies.
Instead of immunizing them when they are 15 months old -- as is
normal -- the vaccine will be administered when the babies are 9
months old. Local authorities (Generalitat) affirm that 32 578
children will receive, beginning next Thursday [11 Jan 2007] onwards,
the so-called triple viral vaccine -- measles, rubella, and mumps.
According to Enrique Bernaola, coordinator of the Spanish Pediatrics
Association Vaccination Advisory Committee, the same children will
have to be [re-]immunized after a period of time has passed. "Until 8
or 12 months of age, the baby is protected by maternal antibodies,
but it is not possible to determine those who still have such
antibodies at 9 months of age. Those who have such antibodies will
neutralize the vaccine, this is the reason why the dose is
administered again to every child", he said. The expert assures that
the first immunization is not 100 per cent effective, so there is a
2nd immunization, which, depending on the community involved, occurs
when children are 3 or 6 years old.
Event though local authorities (Generalitat) declined to give details
with respect to the origin of the virus, Dr. Bernaola assures that
the virus was transported by a Romanian family related to another
Romanian family that caused another measles outbreak in Rome.
Catalonia Health Adviser, Marina Geli, explained yesterday that the
outbreak is not caused by a "more virulent" strain, and she assured
that there is no "sanitary alarm."
In fact, Dr. Carmen Cabezas, from the Generalitat's Health
department, pointed out that the wide immunization coverage allowed a
significant reduction in the incidence of measles, from 5489 cases in
1986 to 5 cases in 2005. She specified that "currently, we can say
that throughout the country, 99 per cent of children between 12 and
15 months old, as well as 91 per cent of all children 4 years old or
less are immunized". Dr. Cabezas added that only in one out of a 100
cases immunization is not efficacious.
"Normally, nobody dies because of measles, but it is also true that
there are cases in which the disease becomes complicated and
pneumonia or encephalitis (brain inflammation) occur", she said. Most
vulnerable people are small babies and adults over 20 years old.
Dr. Cabezas assures that measles is one of the severely infectious
diseases, and that sharing a room with a sick person is enough to
become infected. Most people over 40 years old are immunized against
measles, since they had the disease during early childhood. But those
between approximately 23 and 33 years old are defenseless, since
vaccination became available for all babies since 1981.
On top of this, since viral circulation has been very low during the
past few years, vulnerability of these people is even higher.
"Symptoms start resembling a common cold, for about 4 days, and then
skin spots appear. Since there is no antimicrobial agent available
against measles, the only way to get over the disease is keep rest
and watch out for complications", specified Dr. Cabezas.
In addition to Catalonia, other seriously affected communities during
2006 were Madrid and La Rioja, where outbreaks were also caused by
immigration, but there was no agreement on the numbers of affected
people. According to the Health Ministry, in Madrid only 83 cases
were confirmed, but the Regional Government declared that there were
142 infected persons.
The outbreak commenced in January 2006. The first case was detected
in a 12-year-old boy from the United Kingdom who was visiting Spain.
Studies confirmed that the virus belonged to B3 serotype, and that it
was native from the area where the boy came from. A nephew of this
patient, who visited him at the hospital, became the 2nd infected
person. Later, 10 health care workers became infected, and the
outbreak continued to grow.
In La Rioja, measles infection especially affected small children,
but a case was detected in a 4-year-old child from a foreign country
and who had not received any immunization. Consequently, La Rioja
authorities recorded 18 cases, 3 more than the figures reported by
the Ministry of Health. The La Rioja outbreak was controlled in
February 2006, but it is still not known whether the virus came from
the United Kingdom or from Ukraine. Andalusia was also one of the
affected communities. Only in Almeria, 91 cases had been recorded.
