Cases of avian botulism, leading to the deaths of a small number of birds and fish, have been reported in Capalaba Regional Park.

Redland City Council posted a statement on its Facebook page yesterday [21 Jan 2013] that said the council had "received advice of cases of what is believed to be avian botulism," at the park.

The statement called for local residents to call the council on 3829 8999 if they saw deceased bird life, so the bird could be removed by council officers. "Please do not touch or attempt to remove any bird life yourself," the statement said.

It said current weather conditions were encouraging greater than usual amounts of the naturally-occurring bacteria, _Clostridium botulinum_, which were commonly found in the soil of lakes and ponds, and which became toxic to birds when environmental conditions were favorable.

"Avian botulism is not known to be a human public health risk, but can affect other birds and carrion eaters, such as eels and crows that may eat the affected birds," the statement said.

Redland City councillor Paul Gleeson (Div. 9) said people should keep their dogs on a leash and children away from the mud and deceased animals while using the park.

Anyone seeing a sick animal in the park can call the RSPCA on 1300 ANIMAL (1300 264 625) or Pelican and Seabird Rescue on 0404 118 301.

[Botulism commonly affects water fowl, but it can affect fish as well.

Botulism is sometimes called limberneck in ducks and other waterfowl. Healthy birds, affected birds, and dead birds in various stages of decay are commonly found in the same area. The toxin affects the nervous system by preventing impulse transmission to muscles. Birds are unable to use their wings and legs normally or control the 3rd eyelid, neck muscles, and other muscles. Birds with paralyzed neck muscles cannot hold their heads up and often drown. Death can also result from water deprivation, electrolyte imbalance, respiratory failure, or predation.

Avian botulism is a paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin produced by the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_. These bacteria are widespread in soil and require warm temperatures, a protein source, and an anaerobic (no oxygen) environment in order to become active and produce toxin. Decomposing vegetation and invertebrates combined with warm temperatures can provide ideal conditions for the botulism bacteria to activate and produce toxin. There are several types of toxin produced by strains of _C. botulinum_; birds are most commonly affected by type C and to a lesser extent type E.

Birds either ingest the toxin directly or may eat invertebrates (such as chironomid (nonbiting midges) fly larvae) containing the toxin. Invertebrates are not affected by the toxin and store it in their body. A cycle develops in a botulism outbreak when fly larvae (maggots) feed on animal carcasses and ingest toxin. Ducks and other birds that consume toxin-laden maggots can develop botulism after eating as few as 3 or 4 maggots.

Prompt removal and proper disposal of carcasses by burial or burning (in accordance with applicable ordinances) is highly effective in removing toxin and maggot sources from the environment. If possible, avoid altering water depth by flooding or drawing down water levels during hot weather. This may increase invertebrate and fish die-offs, a protein source for the bacteria.

Providing mildly affected birds with fresh water, shade, and protection from predators may help them recover from the intoxication. Botulism antitoxin is available but requires special handling and must be given early in the intoxication. Birds that survive a botulism outbreak are NOT immune to botulism toxin.
