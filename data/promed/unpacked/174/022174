A prairie dog found at Bobcat Ridge Natural Area is believed to have been infected with plague, prompting officials to urge residents to take caution.

The trail at the Fort Collins Natural Area remains open, but signs have been posted letting residents know about the animal and offering safety advice.

Aran Meyer, wildlife biologist, said officials do not want to cause people to panic but also want to make people aware. "It's important to protect yourself," said Meyer. "We need to find that balance ... I wouldn't say it's unsafe; just have a heightened awareness, a situational awareness, just like you would to avoid West Nile."

A visitor to the natural area noticed a prairie dog that appeared to be ill last weekend [31 Oct - 1 Nov 2015] and alerted a ranger. Initial testing revealed that the rodent was likely infected with plague, though officials are still awaiting final confirmation.

Plague can spread to pets and humans, often through the bite of an infected flea or through close contact with an infected animal. The condition can be fatal unless it is diagnosed and treated quickly.

Colorado has reported 20 total cases of plague in humans between 2005 and 2015, including 4 cases this year [2015] and 8 cases in 2014, according to the Colorado Department of Health and Environment. The plague caused at least 2 deaths this year, including one in Pueblo County as well as the death of 16-year-old TG in Larimer County in June 2015.

TG died just days after his 16th birthday after suffering flu-like symptoms. Health officials believe the teen was bitten by an infected flea somewhere near his family's rural property in Red Feather Lakes. His was the 1st human case of plague in Larimer County since 1999.

Symptoms of plague include sudden onset of high fever, chills, headache, muscle aches and weakness. Residents who become ill with these symptoms within 7 days of visiting a plague-infected area are urged to consult their doctor.

Officials also urge residents to take preventative measures, including using insect repellant on their skin and clothing and using a flea and tick preventative on dogs and cats. Cats are particularly susceptible to plague, and residents are warned not to let them or dogs roam free. (Neither is allowed at Bobcat Ridge.)

Other advice includes: do not camp near rodent nests or burrows; avoid sick or dead animals; and, if you are a hunter or trapper, wear gloves when handling your prey.

[Plague is primarily a disease of wild rodents. It is caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_, which is mainly spread by the bites of infectious fleas. The bacterium is not native to North America. When it was introduced, it became established in some rodent populations. Humans are at risk of becoming infected if they are exposed to rodent fleas.
