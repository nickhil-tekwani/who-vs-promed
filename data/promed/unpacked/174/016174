A positive case of rabies was found in a domestic cat, [which had] bitten a Fresno County resident, health officials said. The Fresno County Department of Public Health said it was the 1st confirmed case of feline rabies in the county since 1943.

Fresno County has been identified as a rabies endemic area by state health officials. Although not mandated, it is highly recommended to have your cat vaccinated for rabies. [Interesting, many areas having rabies require both cats and dogs to be vaccinated against the disease. - Mod.TG] Rabies remains a concern among wild mammals in Fresno County, especially among bats and skunks, health officials said. While any mammal can be infected with the rabies virus, bats are the commonest mammal in the county known to carry rabies. In 2018 and 2019, 6 bats tested positive for rabies in Fresno County.

Gaston County officials have confirmed the 13th case of rabies discovered in the area in 2019. The incident was reported after a family dog was discovered playing with a deceased raccoon at a residence off of Oakwood Drive in Belmont. Authorities sent the raccoon to officials in Raleigh who determined it tested positive for rabies on [Tue 22 Oct 2019].

The dog involved in the incident was euthanized because it had not received the required rabies vaccinations previously. Citations for this penalty were issued to the pet's owners. The Gaston County Police Department Animal Care and Enforcement unit stresses the importance of having a valid rabies vaccination for all of your pet's health and safety as well as the health and safety of their owners and community.

[3] Rhode Island: skunk, dog, human exposure

https://www.ricentral.com/narragansett_times/two-treated-for-rabies-after-encounters-with-wild-animals-in/article_ac8e37c6-f987-11e9-8998-2378066ded28.html


The Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) [has] confirmed [that] 2 individuals have been treated for exposure to the rabies virus since September [2019] after encounters with rabid wild animals in Narragansett [Washington County]. The department also noted [that] 4 wild animals from Narragansett have tested positive for the potentially deadly virus since March [2019].

Four animals submitted for testing at RIDOH's State Health Laboratories have tested positive for rabies this year [2019]. The 1st came in March -- a rabid skunk on Tarzwell Drive. In August, a raccoon spotted on Kathy Street tested positive for the virus. Then, in September, a woodchuck/groundhog seen on Onondega Road was confirmed to possess the virus. Most recently, this month [October 2019], a skunk on Wild Field Farm Road tested positive for rabies after an encounter with a dog in the yard of a residence on the street.

"We received confirmation of another skunk captured on [Fri 18 Oct 2019] after attacking a dog, tested positive for rabies," wrote Narragansett Animal Control on its Facebook page on 21 Oct 2019.

Residents have become concerned regarding the prevalence of the virus locally, though RIDOH stated the increase in confirmed cases of the virus was not cause for alarm. "The number of rabid animals identified in any given community varies from year to year," said Joseph Wendelken, RIDOH public information officer. "The number of rabies-positive animals [confirmed in Narragansett] in 2019 has been higher than expected, but we're dealing with relatively small numbers. The increase in 2019 is not considered statistically significant, meaning the increase is likely due to chance. For example, we have seen year-to-year increases like this in other communities in the past."

According to RIDOH, 5 wild animals from Narragansett were tested by the department in 2016; 4 in 2017, and 9 in 2018. All of these tests were negative. In 2019, 7 animals have so far been tested by RIDOH. 4 have tested positive. According to Monica Tutko, who works full time as a Narragansett animal control officer, the animal control department has received over 50 calls for animals "appearing to be sickly in some manner" since June of last year [2018]. The animal control officer also stated in July of this year, a fox believed to be possibly rabid attacked multiple people and animals in a 24-hour period and was never caught for testing, despite efforts to do so.

Tutko said the situation in Narragansett needed to be taken "quite seriously." RIDOH said while the increase did not indicate a concerning trend upward, residents should still take precautions to decrease risk of exposure. "You can't tell if an animal has rabies by just looking at it," said Wendelken when asked how rabid animals could be identified. "The only way doctors can know for sure if an animal or a person has rabies is to do laboratory tests. A clue though is if the animal is acting strangely. Some animals may act mad when they have rabies. They will be hostile and may try to bite people or other animals. Other animals may act timid or shy when they have rabies. A wild animal might move slowly or act tame. The best thing to do is to never feed or approach a wild animal. Be careful of pets you do not know."

One resident posted to a private resident Facebook page about a September [2019] encounter he had with a rabid woodchuck leaving both he and his wife in need of multiple shots after a recommendation for treatment from RIDOH. The resident concluded the post by asking what was being done to combat the rise in local rabid wild animals.

If a human is bitten by an animal believed to be possibly rabid, washing the wounded area with soap and water for 10-15 minutes is recommended by RIDOH to help remove the virus. The department also strongly suggests contacting a doctor or hospital ER immediately and alerting the local animal control officer of the incident in an effort to further protect others from potential exposure. The public can also call the Rhode Island Department of Health Rabies Control Program to report an exposure (401-222-2577 Monday-Friday from 8:30 am to 4:30 pm; 401-276-8046 after hours). If the animal is a stranger's pet, ask for the owner's contact information, according to RIDOH.

The department also had recommendations when it comes to pet safety. "If your pet has been bitten, try to find out what animal attacked your pet," said Wendelken. "Do not touch the attacking animal. Wear rubber gloves and use a hose to wash your pet's wounds. Do not touch your pet with bare hands. There may be saliva from the attacking animal on your pet. Call your pet's vet immediately, even if the wound is minor. Local animal control should be contacted to report the incident."

RIDOH stated even if a pet has already been recently vaccinated for the virus, a veterinarian should still be contacted immediately and the incident should still be reported to the local animal control. Further recommendations include never approaching a wild animal, being careful around pets one is not familiar with, refraining from petting stray cats or dogs and contacting local animal control if any animal is observed acting strangely.

In the United States, animals most likely to carry rabies are wild animals such as bats, raccoons, skunks, foxes, and woodchucks. Dogs, cats, and ferrets can also carry rabies, but they are less likely to be infected because of the high vaccination rates among pets.

"Rabies is a fatal but preventable viral disease," concluded Wendelken. "The virus infects the central nervous system. If a person does not receive the appropriate medical care after a potential rabies exposure, the virus can cause disease in the brain, ultimately resulting in death. However, rabies can be prevented by vaccinating pets, staying away from wildlife, and seeking medical care after potential exposures before symptoms start."

Due to the recent exposures, the Narragansett Animal Control is stepping up its number of posts concerning the virus on social media and is hosting a public rabies vaccination clinic for pets at the Narragansett Community Center on Sat 9 Nov 2019 from 10 am to 12 pm. USD 10 cash only and attendees are asked to bring previous pet vaccination records if available. The general public is invited and attendance is not restricted based on Narragansett residence.

Rabies is considered a rare disease in the United States with fewer than 1000 confirmed cases per year.

It is very sad that the person in North Carolina had to have his dog euthanized. But it could have been avoided if he had gotten his pet vaccinated. Let's all learn the lesson here and get our pets vaccinated, and keep those vaccinations up to date. Protecting your pet against this fatal disease applies to all pets, including dogs, cats, horses, cattle, sheep, and goats.

Often it is a skunk or raccoon wandering through a pasture who nips the horse or cow on the nose, thus transmitting this virus. Any animal with rabies can be frightening but a large animal of many pounds more than most of us is exceedingly unsettling. Please vaccinate your pets.

The Rhode Island article is the only article in this group doing community wide low-cost rabies vaccinations for pets. I wonder how many horses or goats or other animals will be brought for a rabies vaccination. Reporting a bite is important, but especially if it is a wild animal or an animal you are unfamiliar with. Remember your life is worth more than guessing if an animal has been vaccinated. - Mod.TG]
