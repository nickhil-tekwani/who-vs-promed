The government has extended the areas covered by specific measures against bluetongue, which also affects cattle, after detection of new cases.

A total of "17 new farms" were detected in the Massif Central from the beginning of the epidemic, and "will be notified to the European Union (EU) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE)," said the Prefecture of Puy-de-Dome in a statement to the breeders.

The results of virological analyzes released on Thu [17 Sep 2015] by the Animal Health Laboratory of the National Agency responsible for safety (ANSES) has confirmed "infection with bluetongue of herds of 5 departments of the Allier, Creuse and Puy-de-Dome," said the Ministry of Agriculture in a decree published Fri [18 Sep 2015] in the Official Journal.

The prefecture of Puy-de-Dome also confirmed Friday [18 Sep 2015] morning that 2 cases of bluetongue were found in this department.

These new cases involve animals from holdings located in Charensat and Pontaumur, in the Combrailles sector, west of the department.

In addition to these 5 cases, all confirmed as a result of a check carried out at the Fair of Le Mans (Sarthe), another case was revealed on a sampled animal in the course of export and 11 others during levies made in the 2-km surveillance zone around the initial outbreak, in Allier, said the prefecture.

"Highlighting" of these cases led the Department of Agriculture to extend the restricted zones around new farms concerned.

The regulation provides for a "quarantine zone" with a radius of 20 km subject to drastic measures: the affected ruminants can neither enter nor leave their farms. However, derogations are granted for transport to the slaughterhouse, under strict sanitary conditions.

In total, 112 municipalities are currently part of this restricted area, according to the prefecture of Puy-de-Dome.

More broadly, a "protection zone" with a radius of at least 100 km and a "surveillance zone" of 150 km around the infected farms are also implemented. Animals can move about (only to the slaughterhouse), subject to certain conditions, including movements of animals being authorized by cattle trucks dis-insected and in the absence of clinical signs from animals.

Furthermore, the Ministry of Agriculture confirmed to the newspaper "La Montagne" information indicating that Turkey had decided not to import live animals from the region of Auvergne (Allier, Cantal, Haute-Loire and Puy-de Dome). Meat may continue to be exported.

Discussions are ongoing with the Turkish veterinary services to change the situation, the ministry said.

The French ruminants for fattening or reproduction are mainly exported to Spain and Italy, as well as Turkey, Tunisia and Algeria.

A 1st case of an outbreak of bluetongue in Allier (center) was announced on 11 Sep 2015 by the Ministry of Agriculture.

The species susceptible to bluetongue are domestic and wild ruminants (sheep, cattle, goats). Bluetongue symptoms include fever, difficulty breathing, blueness of the tongue and swelling of the face.

This disease is strictly animal, it does not affect humans and does not affect the quality of food (meat, milk, etc.). It requires containment measures against herds that hinder the marketing of the animals.
