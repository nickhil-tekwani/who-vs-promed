Mumps outbreak in Palencia affects children and youths
------------------------------------------------------
The Epidemiological Surveillance Service of the Junta de Castilla y Leon has reported that an epidemic of mumps affecting children and adolescents which commenced in the spring has continued to developed and is forcing a reexamination of the organisation of vaccination in schools.

According to information provided by the regional government, the clinical symptoms of mumps are acute inflammation of unilateral of bilateral parotid glands, fever and malaise. Local reports indicate that none of those affected in Palencia required hospitalisation and all are recovering well.

The regional Health Service has stated that in order to further interrupt virus transmission among children and juveniles it will become necessary to review the vaccination status of contacts of the patients, both in school and in the family setting.

Likewise the appearance of cases of mumps in particular schools will require review of the vaccination status of all classmates of each affected child in particular schools and where appropriate carry out vaccination. Similar measures are recommended for the family members and social contacts of affected cases.

[In the absence of numbers, it is difficult to evaluate this situation. The persistence of mumps virus infection in a vaccinated, or perhaps partially vaccinated, population may be a reflection of the lesser immunising efficiency of the mumps component of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) triple vaccine. Further information would be appreciated regarding the prevalence of measles virus infection in this community, which might reveal gaps in immunisation coverage.

Palencia is the capital of the province of Palencia in the autonomous community of Castille and Leon, Spain. The Junta de Castilla y Leon is the governing body and administration of Castilla y Leon and exercises executive and regulatory power.
