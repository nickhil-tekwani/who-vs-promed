The Health Department on [Thu 7 Mar 2019] began surveillance activities at Chikkabasavanahalli near Hassan [district, Karnataka state], where the virus causing Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD), also known as monkey fever, has been traced to a tick pool. Senior officials of the department visited the village and distributed DMP [dimethyl phthalate] oil, which acts as a repellent for ticks, to all 184 households. The locals have been asked to apply the liquid on their legs whenever they go to forest areas to collect firewood or graze cattle.

K M Sathish Kumar, district health officer, said the health staff would conduct surveillance for 7 days. "As of now, no one in the village is suffering from fever. We will be monitoring the situation. Our health workers will go door to door and keep track of the health condition of the people here," he said.

With the help of the Forest Department, the health staff also visited forest areas around the village to find out if any monkey deaths have taken place in the area. "We have told the public to inform the department if they notice monkey deaths. If monkey deaths are reported, we have to conduct an autopsy with the help of the Veterinary Department and collect a sample for further laboratory tests," Mr Kumar said.

KFD, a tickborne disease, spreads to monkeys and humans through ticks. The department had collected 624 samples from villages located close to forest areas. The laboratory tests have confirmed the presence of KFD virus in 2 samples. One sample was from Chikkabasavanahalli in Hassan taluk [administrative division], while the other was from Basavanagudi, near Devaladakere in Sakleshpur.

The public can inform the Health Department about monkey deaths by calling 08172-246805/246832.

For the 1st time, the virus causing Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) has been found in the tick pools collected in Hassan district. The samples collected at Chikkabasavanahalli in Hassan taluk [administrative district] and Basavanagudi near Devaladakere in Sakleshpur taluk were confirmed positive for the presence of the KFD virus.

K M Sathish Kumar, district health officer of Hassan, told The Hindu that following KFD cases reported in Shivamogga district, the Health Department collected tick pools in the district and sent them for laboratory tests. Among the 624 samples collected so far, 2 samples were confirmed positive. "We have decided to collect a few more samples in these areas for further confirmation. We will soon take precautionary measures and launch programmes to spread awareness on the spread of the disease," Mr Sathish Kumar said.

Following the KFD reports in Shivamogga, the department collected samples from all villages close to forest areas. As many as 624 samples, one in each village, were collected and sent to tests at the Viral Diagnostic Laboratory in Shivamogga. Rajesh Kulkarni, entomologist with the Health Department, said among the samples sent, so far around 400 had been examined through the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. "We got information orally from the laboratory on [Wed 6 Mar 2019] that 2 samples were positive and got the instruction to start the surveillance in those 2 places," he said.

This tickborne viral infection spreads to mammals. Those who visit forest areas to collect firewood and graze cattle contract the disease through tick bites. So far there have been no reports of the death of monkeys due to the disease in the district. Chikkabasavanahalli in Hassan taluk is located close to Gendekatte Forest. The place is densely populated. Basavanagudi village in Sakleshpur is amid forests of Western Ghats, and only a few families are located around that place.

"We will soon start the surveillance work in both the areas. So far there are no reports of monkey deaths due to the disease. As per the guidelines, we have to take up vaccination drive if tick pools were confirmed positive and monkey deaths were reported. We will write to the state government seeking vaccination," said Mr Kulkarni.

[Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) is caused by Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV), which may be transmitted to humans after a tick bite or contact with an infected animal, most importantly a sick or recently dead monkey. However, no human-to-human transmission has been reported to date [https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/kyasanur/index.html].

The above report on KFDV detection in 2 of the 400 pooled tick tested samples from Hassan district of Karnataka state shows a low prevalence of the virus in ticks (0.5%), indicating that the risk of human transmission from tick bites would be low in this region. - Mod.UBA
