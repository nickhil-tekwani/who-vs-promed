Another farm in Southland has tested positive for the cattle disease _Mycoplasma bovis_, bringing to 8 the number of infected properties in the province.

The Ministry for Primary Industries says the farm was connected with other infested farms in the area through movement of calves.

It was placed under movement restrictions several weeks ago.

_Mycoplasma bovis_, a bacterial disease, is commonly found in cattle globally. It does not infect humans and is not a food safety risk, but can have serious effects on cattle, and was 1st detected in a dairy herd in South Canterbury last year [2017].

It has now been confirmed on 24 properties, from Hawke's Bay to Canterbury, Otago and Southland, and all have been quarantined.

[New Zealand is in the middle of a national testing protocol to determine if the disease can be eradicated. Finding several positive premises is not unexpected. This is likely to continue for several more months in order for authorities to make a determination. - Mod.TG
