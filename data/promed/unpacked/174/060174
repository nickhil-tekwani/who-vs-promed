Latest Information (as of 17 Feb 2006; 13:30 EST)
-------------------------------------------------
The CFIA's (Canadian Food Inspection Agency) animal investigation is
complete. A total of 156 cattle from the affected animal's birth
cohort were identified and traced. All animals were accounted for,
and no additional cases of BSE were detected.
The feed investigation is nearing conclusion. A final analysis of
records collected at the farm, retail and mill levels is underway.
In keeping with previous findings of BSE in Canada, the CFIA will
prepare and publicly release a report summarizing the full results of
the investigation.

Chronology - BSE Case; 4 Jan 2006
---------------------------------
16 Jan 2006: A sample taken from a crossbred cow in north-central
Alberta exhibiting symptoms of BSE consistent with the high risk
categories of animals targeted under Canada's national surveillance
program for BSE was received by the Alberta Provincial Laboratory in
Edmonton. The sample was obtained by a private practitioner under
Canada's national BSE surveillance program.
17-18 Jan 2006: Analysis of the brain tissue sample demonstrated a
reaction on the BIO-RAD rapid screening test. The analysis was
repeated 4 times with similar reactivity. The status of the sample
became INCONCLUSIVE.
Per the international protocol, the sample was sent to the national
reference laboratory for BSE, CFIA's National Centre for Foreign
Animal Diseases (NCFAD) in Winnipeg for confirmatory testing.
19 Jan 2006: The NCFAD conducted 3 separate rapid tests (BIO-RAD,
Prionics Western Blot and Priostrip); samples demonstrated reactivity
in all 3 tests. The status of the sample became SUSPECT. In parallel,
analysis of the sample by internationally recognized "gold standard"
tests for BSE (immuno-histochemistry (IHC) and Western Blot - SAF)
commenced.
20 Jan 2006: An experienced team of CFIA veterinarians and inspectors
was dispatched to the farm of origin to conduct an initial
epidemiological investigation into the animal health and feed aspects
of this case.
22 Jan 2006: NCFAD completed confirmatory testing, and results were
positive; the status of the sample was CONFIRMED POSITIVE.
