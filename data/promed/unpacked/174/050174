A man has died in Uganda's capital after an outbreak of Marburg, a highly infectious hemorrhagic fever similar to Ebola, authorities said on Sunday [5 Oct 2014], adding that a total of 80 people who came into contact with him were quarantined.

Marburg starts with a severe headache followed by hemorrhaging and leads to death in 80 percent or more of cases in about 9 days. It is from the same family of viruses as Ebola, which has killed thousands in West Africa in recent months.

There is no vaccine or specific treatment for the Marburg virus, which is transmitted through bodily fluids such as saliva and blood or by handling infected wild animals such as monkeys.

The health ministry said in a statement that the 30-year-old radiographer died on 28 Sep 2014 while working at a hospital in Kampala. He had started feeling unwell about 10 days earlier, and his condition kept deteriorating. He complained of headache, abdominal pain, vomiting blood and diarrhea.

Samples were taken and tested at the Uganda Virus Research Institute, and results confirmed the man had a marburgvirus.

Doctors said his brother, one of the people he came into contact with, has developed similar symptoms and has been quarantined in a group of 80 others, 60 of whom are health workers.

Those quarantined came into contact with the victim either in Kampala or his burial place in Kasese, a district in western Uganda bordering the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Marburg has a shorter incubation period of 14 days, compared with Ebola's 21. The current outbreak of Ebola, the deadliest on record so far, has killed more than 3400 people in 4 West African countries.

Uganda has been hit by several outbreaks of Marburg and Ebola in the past, but it has contained the outbreaks quickly, limiting fatalities. Its worst occurrence of hemorrhagic fever occurred in 2000, when 425 people contracted Ebola, and more than half of them died.

[The following excerpts are from Mod.CP's commentary on the most recent outbreak of Marburg, which occurred in Uganda in 2012:

"The 1st outbreak of this disease occurred in Marburg, Germany, and Belgrade, former Yugoslavia, in 1967, leading to the initial recognition of this disease. The outbreak was associated with laboratory work using African green monkeys (_Cercopithecus aethiops_) imported from Uganda. Subsequently, outbreaks and sporadic cases have been reported in Angola, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, South Africa (in a person with a recent travel history to Zimbabwe) and Uganda.

Ecological studies are in progress to identify the natural reservoir of both Marburg and Ebola. There is evidence that bats are involved, but much work remains to be done to definitively describe the natural transmission cycle. Monkeys are susceptible to infection but are not considered plausible reservoir hosts, as virtually all infected animals die too rapidly to sustain survival of the virus. Infection of humans occurs sporadically."

The WHO fact sheet on Marburg (available at: http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs_marburg/en/) includes the following information:

- The Marburg virus causes severe viral haemorrhagic fever in humans.
- Case fatality rates in Marburg haemorrhagic fever outbreaks have ranged from 24-88 percent.
- _Rousettus aegypti_, fruit bats of the Pteropodidae family, are considered to be natural hosts of Marburg virus. The Marburg virus is transmitted to people from fruit bats and spreads among humans through human-to-human transmission.
- No specific antiviral treatment or vaccine is available.

ProMED would welcome authoritative information on this outbreak. - Mod.LM
