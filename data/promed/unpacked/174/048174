A total of 2 more cases of avian influenza confirmed on [Fri 10 Feb 2017] have brought the total number of cases in the Republic of Ireland to 8. The H5N8 strain of avian influenza has been confirmed in a grey heron in Middleton, Co Cork, and in a mute swan in Lough Eorna, Co Tipperary.

Both birds were found dead on [Fri 3 Feb 2017] and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) confirmed the presence of H5N8 in both cases on [Fri 10 Feb 2017].

This is the 8th case of bird flu in Ireland; however, the 2 most recent cases confirmed on [Fri 10 Feb 2017] are the 1st to be found in birds considered resident species in Ireland. Previous cases of bird flu found in Tipperary were in the same area as the mute swan found near Lough Eorna, but were whooper swans.

There have also been 2 cases reported in Northern Ireland. The 1st was in a wild swan in Derry at the beginning of February [2017] and the 2nd was confirmed in a whooper swan in Lough Neagh last weekend [3-5 Feb 2017].

Across Europe, DAFM reports that there have been 276 outbreaks in poultry, 19 outbreaks in captive birds and 311 mortality events in wild birds since [1 Jan 2017]. Bird flu has been reported in 16 countries in Europe in February.

[HPAI H5 (where neuraminidase typing was available it turned out to be H5N8), continues to occur throughout Europe. This virus has infected poultry and wild and captive birds in several countries, causing immense losses to the poultry industry.

H5N8 HPAI virus appeared in Great Britain in December 2016, and then in Ireland and it is still actively circulating in the region.

Some recent studies suggest that wild waterfowl and domestic ducks are important in the emergence and maintenance of HPAI H5N8. - Mod.PMB
