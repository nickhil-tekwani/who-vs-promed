Equine cases of West Nile Virus in Florida
------------------------------------------
The first equine case of West Nile virus (WNV)in the United States in 2001
has been confirmed in a Florida horse by USDA-APHIS Veterinary Services'
National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, IA. The positive
horse was located in Jefferson County, Florida. In addition, 2 other ill
horses on 2 separate premises in the same county have been classified as
probable cases of WNV infection.
WNV activity has recently been reported in this area of Florida, including
the finding of WNV-positive crows in June in Jefferson County and later in
adjacent Madison County. Although mosquitoes have been collected in the
area, no WNV-positive pools have been detected.
The confirmed case was in an adult male horse that was euthanatized on or
about 12 Jul 2001. Serum and brain samples were collected prior to death and
sent to the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services'
laboratory in Kissimmee. A positive hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test
result was obtained at that lab and serum and brain was forwarded to NVSL
for WNV confirmation. NVSL confirmed the diagnosis by positive results on an
IgM-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) on serum and a
positive reverse transcriptase nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-nPCR) on
brain tissue.
Serum from the other 2 horses with signs of WNV infection also tested
positive on HI testing in Kissimmee, FL. Serum from these 2 horses was then
forwarded to NVSL. Both horses had positive IgM-capture ELISA test results
at NVSL. Onset of illness in one of the horses was late June and the other
horse in early July. These probable cases may be reclassified as confirmed
cases based on the results of additional serological testing currently being
conducted at NVSL.
Additional information on these cases and on the current status of WNV,
including links to State and local WNV web pages, will be posted on the
APHIS website at: <http://www.aphis.usda.gov/oa/wnv/index.html>
