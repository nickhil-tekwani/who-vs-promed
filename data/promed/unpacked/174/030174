Cholera epidemics have hit tens of thousands of people and killed more
than 1400 others in 7 West and Central African countries since the
start of 2011, the UN office for the Coordination of Humanitarian
Affairs said in a report on Tue 6 Sep 2011.

The WHO says cholera is preventable and treatable and that any death
rate higher than one percent, as is the case in several countries,
denotes problems in a health system.

Following are some facts and figures on outbreaks in the region's
various countries:

Cameroon: 9 of the country's 10 provinces have reported outbreaks of
cholera, with a total of 10 582 cases and 379 deaths as of mid-August
2011.

Chad: There is a rapid spread of the disease from the west to the east
of the country with a total of 11 345 cases and 340 deaths as of the
end of August 2011.

Congo DR: A cholera epidemic that started in the east of the country
has spread along the Congo River to the west, with 5171 cases and 301
deaths as of 22 Aug 2011.

Mali: Health authorities said there have been cholera outbreaks in 3
regions of the country, leaving 880 people infected and 36 dead as of
23 Aug 2011.

Niger: There have been outbreaks in about 10 districts in the south
and southeast districts of the country, leading to 1008 people being
infected and 26 deaths as of mid-August 2011.

Nigeria: Reports say there have been cholera epidemics in 23 of the
country's 36 states, with 13 551 cases and 353 deaths as of mid-August
2011.

Republic of Congo: There have been cholera outbreaks in 4 provinces in
the country, Brazzaville, Cuvette, Likouala and Plateaux, with 341
people said to have been infected and 20 deaths.

[2] Cholera - Burundi

Burundian health officials are battling to control a cholera outbreak
that has killed 12 people and infected 600 others since August 2011.
Although the epidemic is under control in some areas, health officials
in the capital, Bujumbura, said a new area of infection had started at
Nyanza Lac, Makamba province, where 80 new cases have been reported,
64 of whom are in hospital.

"The figure is still high at Nyanza Lac because the infection is still
new there, and contingency measures are not yet in place as in other
affected areas," said Pamphile Bukuru, an officer in charge of
information, education and communication for behaviour change in the
Ministry of Public Health.

The epidemic was reported on 5 Aug 2011 in the southern town of
Rumonge in Bururi province, a cholera-prone area where residents often
use unsafe water from Lake Tanganyika. The disease then spread rapidly
to other localities, including the capital, Bujumbura, and provinces
of Bujumbura Rural, Bubanza, Cibitoke and Makamba.

The Health Ministry declared the outbreak an epidemic on 18 Aug 2011
and mobilized its partners to put in place measures to control the
disease.

Cholera frequently breaks out in the south of the country as well as
in the capital's suburbs due to the lack of safe drinking water and
latrines. Hygiene sensitization is, therefore, a crucial component of
the strategy to control the disease outbreak.

[3] Cholera - Chad

http://www.thespec.com/news/world/article/590630--red-cross-says-cholera-epidemic-hit-364-deaths-so-far-this-year


The Red Cross says Chad faces a cholera epidemic with 12 713 cases and
364 deaths recorded so far in 2011. The International Federation of
Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies says cholera has spread to 33 of
Chad's 62 districts, and the number of cases could double within a few
weeks in the fall rainy season.

The humanitarian aid group told reporters Wednesday [7 Sep 2011] in
Geneva its main concern is to prevent cholera from spreading to more
regions of the country and to stop it reaching refugee camps along the
Sudanese border. The IFRC said it is also worried about cholera
outbreaks in Cameroon, Niger and Nigeria.

[4] Cholera - Somalia (Mogadishu)

Cholera has claimed 58 more lives in the Somali capital, Mogadishu,
where cases of waterborne diseases have increased due to unhygienic
living conditions, Press TV reports. The victims died within the last
24 hours in southern districts of Mogadishu, a Press TV correspondent
reported on Thu 15 Sep 2011.

More than 310 people, suffering from cholera and waterborne diseases,
also flocked hospitals in southern Mogadishu to get some medication.
This comes as doctors are already overstretched by the number of those
arriving with cholera.

Doctor Ahmed Sheikh Doon Diini, from Banadir hospital in Mogadishu,
said on 23 Aug 2011 that overcrowding at the camps has been the main
challenge to health workers. A combination of poor sanitation
conditions, scarcity of safe and clean drinking water, and
overcrowding has led to the spread of waterborne diseases in
Mogadishu.

According to the World Health Organization, some 75 percent of all
cases of highly infectious diarrhea are among children under the age
of 5.

Cholera is confirmed in Banadir, Bay, Mudug and Lower Shabelle regions
of Somalia, and the number of acute diarrhea cases has increased
dramatically in the last few months.

A fresh cholera outbreak has killed 18 people in northern Nigeria's
Bauchi state in the past week, officials said Tue 6 Sep 2011, in the
latest epidemic to ravage the region during the rainy season. They
said infections spread across 4 districts of the state, with the
worst-hit being Warju council area, which recorded 10 deaths.

"We have recorded 10 deaths from the cholera outbreak, while another
30 people have been hospitalized in the past week," Adamu Yahaya, head
of Warju local government area of the state, told AFP. State health
commissioner Sani Malami said 8 other people had died in 3 other
districts.

Some 35 people have died from cholera in northern Yobe and Sokoto
states in the past 2 weeks, while dozens of others have been
hospitalized.

Cholera outbreaks occur regularly during the rainy season in Nigeria,
when downpours wash contaminants into wells used by families. The
rainy season typically runs from April to September.

[The rainy season in West and Central Africa is contributing to the
upswing in cholera cases, while the drought in Somalia is doing
similarly. Although epidemic disease due to _V. cholerae_ was
originally called Asiatic cholera, a great majority of the cases
occurring yearly are now in Africa. - Mod.LL]
