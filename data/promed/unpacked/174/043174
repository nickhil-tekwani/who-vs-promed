Safety information revealing deaths in Japanese children taking the
influenza medication Tamiflu is being discussed by the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) on Fri 18 Nov 2005. A safety committee of the European
Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA) has also requested information from the
drug's manufacturer Roche.

However, the meeting of the FDA paediatric advisory committee is a routine
assessment of safety, performed for relatively new drugs prescribed to
children. 7 others, including the controversial Vioxx (rofecoxib), are
being considered. The FDA notes: "Based on the information available to us,
we cannot conclude that there is a causal relationship between Tamiflu and
the reported paediatric deaths". It adds that the "increased reports of
neuropsychiatric events in Japanese children are most likely related to an
increased awareness of influenza-associated encephalopathy", increased use
of Tamiflu in Japan, and greater monitoring of adverse events.

The examination by the FDA and EMEA of Tamiflu has drawn attention because
of the current outbreak of highly pathogenic bird flu in East Asia. This
has increased fears of a human pandemic, for which Tamiflu would be the
frontline treatment.

Since Tamiflu (oseltamivir) was approved in 1999, 12 children under 16
years of age and taking the drug have died, and 32 have suffered
"neuropsychiatric events", such as hallucinations, confusion, convulsions
and brain inflammation. All the deaths and the vast majority of adverse
events in children, also including skin rashes and sensitivity, have been
reported in Japan, where Tamiflu has been widely prescribed.

Many of the children died in their sleep, but one committed suicide an hour
after taking the flu pill. Alarming behaviour has also been recorded. For
example, there are 2 reports of boys jumping out of upper floor windows of
their homes after 2 doses of Tamiflu. And in another case, an 8 year old
boy fled his house onto the street after having frightening hallucinations,
3 hours after his 1st dose.

The submission from Hoffman La-Roche -- Roche's US division -- to the FDA
states that the adverse events reported could be the result of influenza
itself. Neurological complications are not uncommon during influenza
infections, the symptoms of which occur concurrently with the usage of
Tamiflu, making any causal relationship of these events to Tamiflu
difficult to assess in the absence of a controlled trial.

The FDA notes that the evidence that influenza can cause brain
inflammation, or encephalitis, was first reported by Japanese
paediatricians in the 1990s, and the increased awareness of this rare flu
complication may mean that Japanese doctors are more likely to report it
than elsewhere. Japan also uses the majority of the world's Tamiflu supply
for seasonal influenza. It has used 24 million prescriptions -- 4 times
more than the US, says Hoffman La-Roche. The country has also had intensive
monitoring of the drug in its first 6 months after launch and again in the
very active flu season of 2004 to 2005.

The FDA said on Thu 17 Nov 2005 that it anticipated it would continue
monitoring adverse events linked with Tamiflu and report back to its
paediatric advisory committee within 2 years.

The Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry does not plan to warn medical
institutions of the danger of using Tamiflu, despite a report by the US
Food and Drug Administration that is looking into the deaths of several
Japanese children who took the drug, a ministry official said.

An official of the ministry's Safety Division said: "We can't deny the link
[between the deaths and the side effects of Tamiflu]. But a large volume of
Tamiflu has been available here, so the number of deaths isn't high even if
they died from the side effect." Japan reportedly is the largest consumer
of the drug, with 8 million to 10 million patients prescribed the medicine
each year.

The Ministry has confirmed 13 children aged 16 or under died after taking
Tamiflu. In 8 cases, the causal relation between the deaths and taking the
medicine has been ruled out because they died of illnesses unrelated to
influenza.

The government on Fri 18 Nov 2005 brushed off US safety concerns about the
flu-fighting drug Tamiflu, the medicine Japan plans to stockpile to counter
a possible outbreak of avian influenza that can infect humans. Chief
Cabinet Secretary Shinzo Abe, citing experts, said Tamiflu does not cause
safety problems if it is prescribed "appropriately."

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) decided to investigate a possible
link between Tamiflu and the deaths of 12 Japanese children. The Japanese
Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has already concluded that Tamiflu
was not a factor in half of the cases. But the FDA said the deaths were
unusual enough to prompt a further evaluation of the drug, manufactured by
Roche Holding AG of Switzerland.

The FDA on Friday reported the deaths to its Pediatric Advisory Committee,
which will search for any links between the drug and symptoms resulting in
death. The FDA collected documents on suspected cases of adverse effects of
8 drugs, including Tamiflu, on patients aged 16 or younger around the world
between March 2004 and April 2005. According to the data, 12 children --
all in Japan -- died after taking Tamiflu. "In many of these cases, a
relationship to Tamiflu was difficult to assess because of the use of other
medications, presence of other medical conditions, and/or lack of adequate
detail in the reports," the FDA said.

An official at the health ministry's Safety Division said it has received a
report on 13 deaths, not 12, from Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., which imports
and distributes Tamiflu in Japan. The Ministry said there was no
relationship between Tamiflu and the deaths of 6 of the patients, adding
that 5 of them died of influenza encephalopathy and the other died of
pneumonia. The Ministry, citing a lack of data and other reasons, said it
could not rule out the possibility that side effects of Tamiflu caused the
deaths in the 7 other cases. But the Ministry suspects they died of
diseases such as influenza encephalopathy, and that Tamiflu was not a factor.
