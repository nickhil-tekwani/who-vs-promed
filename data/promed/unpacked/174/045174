Because West Nile virus (WNV) has become endemic in North America,
and cases can be expected to occur throughout the virus transmission
season, ProMED-mail will be reporting only newly detected virus and
human cases in the US states and Canadian provinces for the current
reporting period. Those wishing to see the complete summary for virus
detection in birds, mosquitoes, sentinel animals, and equines as well
as a breakdown of human disease cases for 2008 can access that
information on the following sites:

[1] Canada
Date: 5-11 Oct 2008


Human cases: no new cases this period
Total human cases in 2008: 35 (includes 2 cases from outside home province)

Wild Birds: The Canadian Cooperative Wildlife Health Center has
informed ProMED-mail that as of 21 Oct 2008, birds have been tested
in the following provinces:

(Number positive for WNV / Total tested):
British Columbia 0 / 215
New Brunswick 0 / 50
Nova Scotia 0 / 41
Ontario 150/ 791
Prince Edward Island 0 / 82
[Note: Quebec doesn`t appear to have tested any birds in 2008
- Mod.TY]

The Public Health Agency of Canada reports for the year to 11 Oct
2008 that 85 percent of the WNV positive birds are American crows
(_Corvus brachyrhynchos_) and 15 percent are blue jays (_Cyanocitta
cristata_).

Equine cases as of 5 Oct 2008 are 1 in Quebec, 2 in Ontario, and 2 in
Saskatchewan. (The Quebec case is new for 2008).

Mosquito pools positive for WNV during the period 5-11 Oct 2008: 122
[Ontario (62), Manitoba (41), Saskatchewan (19)].

[2] USA
Date: 15-21 Oct 2008


States newly reporting WNV detected: none
(The only states not reporting WNV presence in 2008 are: Alaska,
Hawaii, and Maine).
States newly reporting human cases: none
There have been a total of 1141 human cases and 25 fatalities to date
in 2008 in the USA.

States reporting equine WNV infections for the 1st time in 2008
during the period 8-14 Oct 2008: Michigan

A total of 123 equine cases have been reported nationally in 2008.

[3] USA: CDC, false positive results, commercial test recalled

False-positive results with a commercially available West Nile Virus
IgM ELISA kit
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA), and state health departments are
investigating an increase in false-positive test results obtained
with a commercially-available West Nile virus immunoglobulin M
capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (WNV IgM capture ELISA). On
8 Oct 2008, Inverness Medical (Princeton, NJ), the manufacturer of
the implicated assays, voluntarily recalled 2 lots of their PanBio
WNV IgM capture ELISA kit. One lot (no. 07262) was only distributed
in Canada. The other lot (no. 08118) was distributed from
July-September 2008 to 4 laboratories in the United States.

The laboratories that used the recalled test kit include ViroMed
(Minnetonka, MN), Meritcare Health System (Fargo, ND), Pennsylvania
Department of Health (Exton, PA), and Baylor University Medical
Center (Dallas, TX). Based on the investigation to date, this
increase in false-positive results appears to be limited to these 2
lots of the PanBio kit. CDC and FDA will continue to monitor and
evaluate any additional reports of false-positive tests that may have
resulted from previous lots.

As background, there are 4 FDA-cleared WNV IgM ELISA kits from
different manufacturers commercially available in the US. According
to the package inserts, all of these kits are indicated for use on
serum to aid in the presumptive laboratory diagnosis of WNV infection
in patients with clinical symptoms of meningitis or encephalitis. The
package inserts also state that all positive results obtained with
any of the commercially available WNV test kits should be confirmed
by additional testing at a state health department laboratory or CDC.
Public health practitioners, healthcare providers, and clinical
laboratories are reminded to consider the intended use and
limitations of these kits when requesting WNV testing and
interpreting the results.

The testing laboratories specified above will work with CDC and state
and local health departments to notify hospitals or healthcare
providers who submitted specimens that tested positive between July
and September 2008 using the recalled PanBio kit. If the original
specimen is still available, it will be retested at a state public
health laboratory or CDC using a different WNV IgM assay. Healthcare
providers will be notified of the results. If the original specimen
is not available, health departments will work with healthcare
providers to decide if a new serum specimen should be obtained for
WNV testing.

As the investigation proceeds, the provisional number of WNV disease
cases reported to CDC for 2008 will be adjusted, with information
available at <http://www.cdc.gov/westnile>.

False-positive test results that occurred between July and September
2008 may have led to an incorrect diagnosis in some patients. If the
patient is still experiencing symptoms, additional evaluation and
alternative diagnoses should be considered. State health departments
can help healthcare providers decide if a new serum specimen should
be obtained to test for WNV or another etiology.

For more information about false-positive WNV tests, refer to
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/wnv_DiagnosticsUpdate.html>.

For more information on individual specimens affected by this
commercial test recall, please contact your state health department.
