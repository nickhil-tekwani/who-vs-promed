USDA Bars Some Florida Fruit Shipments
-----------------------------------------------
The federal government Tuesday [6 Jun 2006] barred Florida citrus growers
from sending fresh fruit to other citrus-producing states this season,
fearing diseases that have damaged crops here would spread elsewhere.
The move comes at a crucial time for Florida's industry, as officials
continue working on a plan to manage diseases like canker and greening,
which blemish fruit, kill trees and have been difficult to contain.
Florida officials said they were blind-sided by the federal Department of
Agriculture announcement, though it's not immediately clear how much it
will hurt the industry. About 90 percent of Florida citrus is processed
into juice, while only fresh fruit is affected by the new rule.
Jim Rogers, spokesman for the USDA Plant and Animal Inspection Service,
said other states concerned about their own industries requested the
protection.
It's also not clear how long the interim rule would last beyond this
harvesting season, which begins in August 2006.
"We were surprised, stunned," Florida Agriculture Department spokeswoman
Liz Compton said. "We had proposed an option that would have allowed
shipment of fresh citrus to producing states under strict guidelines. We
feel that we've got the science to back that up. We've had no cases in
which commercially packed citrus spread canker, none in 10 years."
Florida's iconic USD 9 billion citrus industry has been battered by 2
seasons of devastating hurricanes that ruined crops and spread a disease
called canker so far that the federal government decided in January 2006 it
was a lost cause to contain it. The disease is harmless to humans but makes
fruit blemish and drop prematurely from the tree, making it harder to sell.
Previously, every tree within a 1900-foot radius of one infected with
canker was destroyed.
Under the interim rule, Florida growers cannot ship to 11 states and
territories: Alabama, American Samoa, Arizona, California, Guam, Hawaii,
Louisiana, Northern Mariana Island, Puerto Rico, Texas and the Virgin Islands.
Fresh fruit shipped to other areas must be from groves canker-free for 2
years, inspected within 30 days of the start of harvest, treated with a
decontaminating solution and free of other plant material.
Cody Estes, president with the Indian River Citrus League, said growers
weren't completely surprised, but hoped the ban doesn't last longer than a
year.

[The fruit crop disease Citrus canker (CC), caused by the bacterium
_Xanthomonas axonopodis_ pv _citri_, continues to be present in Florida,
following a severe year for the disease in 2005.
The reported action by the US federal government to ban the shipment of
fresh citrus fruit from all of Florida comes as a predictable consequence
of the recent (11 Jan 2006) withdrawal of federal funding for compensation
for removal of CC infected trees in commercial groves (20060217.0523). The
federal government has responded to concerns of other states that do not
have CC and with fresh fruit industries to protect, in particular
California. State organized attempts at eradication in Florida ceased in
January 2006 as a disease management practice once compensation for tree
removal was stopped.
Disease management of CC depends upon use of integrated management
programs, exclusion/sanitation procedures, selection of pathogen-free
citrus budwood with field resistance to CC, cultural control and use of
preventive sprays of copper-based bactericides. Eradication of infected
trees, a technique used heavily in every past major outbreak of CC in
Florida, is now no longer contributing to the management of the current
ongoing epidemic, fueled in part by frequent recent hurricanes.
This posting exemplifies the impact quarantine can have once it becomes
necessary because disease management is not being practiced adequately. In
this case, the juice and processed fruit market is the major (90 percent)
part of the citrus industry in Florida and will be little impacted by the
quarantine, at least initially. The consequences will be felt in those
areas of the state that specialize in fresh fruit, especially grapefruit.
The loss of the California market is expected to hit tangerine and
specialty citrus growers hardest. More than 70 percent of specialty citrus
is sold as fresh fruit each year. The statewide quarantine will not affect
shipments to non-growing citrus states as much, but note the conditions
reported above even for these states.
