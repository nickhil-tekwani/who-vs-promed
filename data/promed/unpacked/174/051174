The Health Department has predicted a spring surge in cases of Ross River virus [infection] after its latest figures showed more than double the average cases in the past month.

According to the department, 31 Perth [Western Australia] residents were diagnosed with the virus in the 4 weeks to 19 Aug [2013], more than double the average of 14 cases. There were another 8 cases diagnosed outside the Perth area.

Health Department entomologist Peter Neville said there had been more mosquitoes than usual in the past 3 years. "We would well assume an increase in cases in the coming couple of months, especially in spring and summer," he said. Dr Neville said it was unclear whether the Perth residents had contracted the virus at home. Winter tourism spots, such as Broome, were also known for high mosquito numbers, he said.

[A woman] from Wembley [Western Australia] showed symptoms a week after she was bitten in her backyard. One of her feet swelled up and she had a fever and aching joints which lasted 3 months. "I remember getting out of bed one morning and I had the most awful pain," she said. "I felt like I'd broken my foot."

She is now still unable to fully move her fingers 7 months later, is often tired and has had to postpone her university studies. She said she had known little about the virus before she was bitten and her illness was a warning it was not limited to rural areas. "It's just never occurred to me it could happen in the suburbs of Perth," she said.

Dr Neville said low rainfall at the start of winter could still stem the number of mosquitoes, which hatch when they are submerged in water.

Lower than average rainfall is believed to have led to an overall decrease in cases of Ross River virus over the past 12 months.

However, because of heavy falls in the South West where the virus is also prevalent, councils are monitoring mosquito numbers.

The Southern saltmarsh mosquito spreads the virus throughout Perth. Dr Neville said the most "aggressive biters" were expected to surface in summer.

The department advises those concerned about mosquitoes to clear gutters and empty containers holding water, such as plant pot bases, to destroy breeding areas.

[This is the 1st report of Ross River virus infections in Western Australia this year (2013). Ross River virus (RRV) infections in Western Australia increased significantly in 2012. There were 1570 cases in the 2011-2012 transmission season. RRV is a zoonotic alphavirus transmitted by a wide range of mosquitoes including _Aedes_ and _Culex_ species, and although not fatal, causes acute polyarthritis in humans. A candidate RRV vaccine has been tested in humans. The adjuvanted, inactivated whole-virus Vero cell-derived RRV vaccine is highly immunogenic in RRV-naive adults and well tolerated at all dose levels. Since this vaccine is not commercially available, avoidance of mosquito bites, as indicated in the report above, is the only preventive measure available currently.
