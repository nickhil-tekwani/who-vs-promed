A new and previously unrecorded outbreak of '_Southern tomato virus_' (STV) has been reported in the UK. The virus has been previously reported around mainland Europe for some years.

The virus (which displays symptoms akin to ToBRFV [_Tomato brown rugose fruit virus_]/PepMV [_Pepino mosaic virus_]) does not seem to be very damaging to tomato plants and is thought to be seed borne. Where outbreaks occur the virus is not easily mechanically moved so removal of affected plants is thought to be the best control measure. The British Tomato Growers' Association will work with AHDB [Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board] to give additional information.

[_Southern tomato virus_ (STV) is a member of the new genus _Amalgavirus_ and was first reported in the Americas. The genus _Amalgavirus_ (family Amalgaviridae) has been designated as part of the plant cryptoviruses and is phylogenetically related to virus families containing nematode, protozoan and fungal pathogens.

STV has been detected in many different commercial and local tomato varieties, but so far it is not known if it can also affect other crops. Symptoms on tomato may include leaf yellowing, stunting and fruit malformations, but asymptomatic infections also occur. A high rate of seed transmission in tomato of up to 90 percent has been reported. Specific insect vectors or horizontal transmission, such as by mechanical means or grafting, have not been reported for STV. A role of potential weedy reservoir species is being investigated.

STV has frequently been detected in mixed infections with other tomato viruses. Its pathogenic role in these scenarios and its epidemiology are still unclear. Tomato seeds are traded widely and are known to pose a risk for spreading viruses and other pathogens (such as, pospiviroids, ProMED-mail post 20140122.2222560) internationally. Therefore, work to assess a potential quarantine risk posed by STV is needed (as for the new ToBRFV, see ProMED-mail post 20190429.6448297).

The other viruses mentioned above are _Tomato brown rugose fruit virus_ (ToBRFV, genus _Tobamovirus_) which was identified as a new disease of glasshouse tomatoes in 2015 and can also affect capsicum crops; and _Pepino mosaic virus_ (PepMV, genus _Potexvirus_) which affects a range of solanaceous crops and is spreading in the Americas and Europe. (For more information on these viruses see links below and previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives.)
