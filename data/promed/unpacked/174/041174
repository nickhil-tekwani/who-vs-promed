Salmonella typhimurium DT104 - Germany 20001016.1774
Date: Tue, 17 Oct 2000 16:07:23 +0200
From: Reiner Helmuth <r.helmuth@bgvv.de>

The recent _Salmonella typhimurium_ outbreaks described below belong to the
phagetype DT204 group of phages and not to DT104. In Germany DT204c has
predominated among the bovine isolates at the beginning of the nineties.
However, this multiresistant phagetype has completely disappeared and is
substituted by pentaresistant DT104 which represents now 80% of all cattle
isolates in Germany.
In respect to the DT204b infections in Europe it is striking, that it doesn't
seem to be easy to find an animal or food reservoir. Among all 12 000
isolates investigated by the German Salmonella Reference Laboratory in 1998
to 2000 originating from animals and food, none belonged to phagetype
DT204b.
