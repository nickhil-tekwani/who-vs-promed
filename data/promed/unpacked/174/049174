The Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported on 11 Oct [2016] that a horse in Allendale County, South Carolina, has tested positive for Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE).

"The case is an unvaccinated 1-year-old Quarter Horse from Allendale County," the EDCC statement said. "The horse did not survive. This is the 1st confirmed case in this county this year [2016]. The total number of confirmed cases in South Carolina in 2016 is now 15."

A viral disease, EEE affects the central nervous system and is transmitted to horses by infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs of EEE include moderate to high fever, depression, lack of appetite, cranial nerve deficits (facial paralysis, tongue weakness, difficulty swallowing), behavioral changes (aggression, self-mutilation, or drowsiness), gait abnormalities, or severe central nervous system signs, such as head-pressing, circling, blindness, and seizures. The course of EEE can be swift, with death occurring 2 to 3 days after onset of clinical signs despite intensive care. Horses that survive might have long-lasting impairments and neurologic problems.

Horse owners should also consult their private practicing veterinarian to determine an appropriate disease prevention plan for their horses. Vaccines have proven to be a very effective prevention tool. Horses that have been vaccinated in past years will need an annual booster shot. However, if an owner did not vaccinate their animal in previous years, the horse will need the 2-shot vaccination series within a 3- to 6-week period.

In addition to vaccinations, horse owners also need to reduce the mosquito populations and their possible breeding areas. Recommendations include removing stagnant water sources, keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, which are typically early in the morning and evening, and using mosquito repellents.

On 18 Oct [2016], a new Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) case was confirmed in Osceola County, Florida. The 4 year old grade male's vaccination history is unknown and he had no recent travel history. Clinical signs began on 9 Oct 2016 and the horse was euthanized for humane reasons one day later.

This is the 5th confirmed EEE case in Osceola County and case 21 in Florida for 2016.

EEE is a mosquito-transmitted disease that is much more severe than West Nile Virus (WNV). The mortality rate in horses from WNV is reported at around 30 percent, while the rate for EEE is almost 90 percent. Infected mosquitoes are the primary source for EEE.

The virus causes inflammation or swelling of the brain and spinal cord. General signs include central nervous system signs such as: head pressing, convulsions, lack of response to facial stimulation, fever above 103 deg F [approx. 39.5 deg C], ataxia, paralysis, anorexia, depression and stupor. Other symptoms may include irregular gait, teeth grinding, incoordination, circling, and staggering. All signs may not be exhibited by an infected horse.

[Vaccination is very effective in preventing the viral infection. The vaccine is usually a combination of EEE, WNV, WEE and sometimes VEE and tetanus. Mosquito control is very important in reducing the mosquitos, which is another form of helping to protect your horse.

Protection from EEE can wane in approximately 4 months. Areas with high prevalence would be wise to vaccinate every 4 months.

Vaccination schedules for EEE/WEE
---------------------------------
"Adult horses previously vaccinated against EEE/WEE: annual revaccination must be completed prior to vector season in the spring. In animals at high risk or with limited immunity, more frequent vaccination or appropriately timed vaccination is recommended in order to induce protective immunity during periods of likely exposure. In areas where mosquitoes are active year-round, many veterinarians elect to vaccinate horses at 6 month intervals to ensure uniform protection throughout the year, although this practice is not specifically recommended by manufacturers of vaccines.

"Adult horses, previously unvaccinated against EEE/WEE or of unknown vaccination history: administer a primary series of 2 doses with a 3 or 4 to 6 week interval between doses. Revaccinate prior to the onset of the next vector season and annually thereafter.

"Pregnant mares, previously vaccinated against EEE/WEE: vaccinate 4 to 6 weeks before foaling.

"Pregnant mares, unvaccinated or having unknown vaccination history: immediately begin a 2-dose primary series with a 3 or 4 week interval between doses. Booster at 4 to 6 weeks before foaling or prior to the onset of the next vector season - whichever occurs first.

"Foals of mares vaccinated against EEE/WEE in the pre-partum period: administer a primary 3-dose series beginning at 4 to 6 months of age. A 3 or 4 to 6 week interval between the 1st and 2nd doses is recommended. The 3rd dose should be administered at 10 to 12 months of age, prior to the onset of the next mosquito season.

"In the south eastern US, due to earlier seasonal disease risk, vaccination may be started at 2 to 3 months of age. When initiating vaccinations in younger foals, a series of 4 primary doses should be administered, with a 3 or 4 week interval between the 1st and 2nd doses and a 4 week interval between the 2nd and 3rd doses. The 4th dose should be administered at 10 to 12 months of age, prior to the onset of the next mosquito season.

"Foals of unvaccinated mares or having unknown vaccination history: administer a primary series of 3 doses with a 30 day interval between the 1st and 2nd doses and a 60 day [8 week] interval between the 2nd and 3rd doses. The primary series of vaccinations should be initiated at 3 to 4 months of age and, where possible, be completed prior to the onset of the high-risk insect vector season. If the primary series is initiated during the mosquito vector season, an interval of 3 to 4 weeks between the 2nd and 3rd doses is preferable to the interval of 8 weeks described above.

"Horses having been naturally infected and recovered: recovered horses likely develop lifelong immunity. Consider revaccination only if the immune status of the animal changes the risk for susceptibility to infection. Examples of these conditions would include the long-term use of corticosteroids and pituitary adenoma."
