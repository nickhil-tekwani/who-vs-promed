[2] UN Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER) officially ends
Date: Sat 1 Aug 2015

http://azertag.az/en/xeber/UN_Ebola_mission_officially_ends-874876


The World Health Organization (WHO) will now spearhead the response to Ebola. A United Nations operation to fight the Ebola outbreak in West Africa has completed its objectives, according to the UN Secretary-General. Ban Ki-moon on Friday [31 Jul 2015] announced the official end of the UN Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER). The World Health Organization (WHO) will now spearhead the organization's response to the virus, which has killed more than 11 000 people since March 2014. The UN Secretary-General said the UN remains committed to supporting the countries as they work to reach zero cases. He noted that while considerable progress has been made, the crisis is not over.

Mr Ban encouraged sustained financial and political support to end the outbreak.

A high-level conference at UN Headquarters in New York last month [July 2015] ended with more than USD 5 billion in pledges to assist the 3 affected countries. The Ebola mission, also called UNMEER, was established last year [2014] as WHO struggled to get a handle on an outbreak that has killed more than 11 000 people, mainly in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. WHO had been strongly criticized for fumbling its response to the epidemic, and the creation of UNMEER was widely seen as a rebuke to its leadership.

Speaking to reporters Fri [31 Jul 2015], UNMEER chief David Nabarro said he had seen signs that WHO had already absorbed some of the lessons of the Ebola disaster, recovering its coordination role in West Africa and deploying more 1000 staffers to the field.

"This is an example of the new WHO at work," he said.

Speaking alongside him was WHO boss Dr. Margaret Chan, who said her agency was working to reform itself, especially by establishing an emergency arm that would operate independently.

But Charles Clift, a public health expert at the London policy institute Chatham House, was unsure whether adding another department to WHO would help. And despite the health agency's repeated vows to hold itself accountable, Clift was unconvinced. He noted that some of the WHO leaders in Africa blamed for the slow response to Ebola have since been moved to other countries.

"Getting sacked doesn't really happen at the U.N.," he said.

Chan acknowledged that WHO was slow and that she was "absolutely accountable" for everything the agency does.

[Excerpted from: UN Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER) (http://ebolaresponse.un.org/un-mission-ebola-emergency-response-unmeer): UNMEER was established on 19 Sep 2014 after the unanimous adoption of General Assembly resolution 69/1, and the adoption of Security Council resolution 2177 (2014) on the Ebola outbreak. UNMEER was set up as a temporary measure to meet immediate needs related to the unprecedented fight against Ebola. The Mission deployed financial, logistical and human resources to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone to support the push to zero cases.

The Mission achieved its core objective of scaling up the response on the ground and establishing unity of purpose among responders in support of the nationally led efforts. - Mod.LK]

1 Aug 2015 Liberia: Palm oil company is accused of exploiting Liberia's Ebola crisis

[As Liberia emerges as a new frontier market for the cheapest, most popular vegetable oil globally, Liberians report being beaten, threatened, and arrested for taking a stand against one of the world's biggest palm oil plantations in the southeast of the country.

State officials are said to be helping the palm oil company Golden Veroleum (GVL) harass communities into signing away their land and crush dissent. Global Witness reveals how GVL accelerated its operations at the peak of Liberia's 2014 Ebola outbreak, holding meetings with hundreds of people and encouraging illiterate citizens to sign away their land rights when community support groups were staying home for risk of contagion. At this time, GVL almost doubled the size of its plantation. ...more]

30 Jul 2015: Sierra Leone faces Ebola setback
http://www.news24.com/Africa/News/Sierra-Leone-faces-Ebola-setback-20150730
[Freetown - Authorities in Sierra Leone said on Thu 29 Jul 2015 that they had quarantined 500 people after a man died from Ebola in an area where the deadly virus had been gone for months, in another setback for the fight against the disease.

Hassan Abdul Sesay, a member of parliament from the region, said that the victim had contracted Ebola in the capital, Freetown and then travelled to his home village to mark the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.

Northern Tonkolili District had not had a single case of Ebola in 5 months, and the World Health Organisation said earlier this week that the lowest number of new cases in a year had been reported in West Africa.

The new case shows, however, how just one sick person can change that. The man was treated for fever at a local hospital, but authorities did not call the Ebola emergency number.

Ebola's main symptom is fever, which is also found in more common illnesses such as malaria and typhoid.

Now the 30 nurses who treated him and his entire home village are being quarantined. Authorities are also concerned because the man's father is a taxi driver who brought his son to at least 2 hospitals. His family and friends buried him without following the special procedures required for Ebola victims to avoid spreading the disease after death.

Authorities still expressed optimism that the disease would soon be contained. "Sierra Leone is on the last lap to get to zero number of cases, and we are bringing in the Sierra Leone police and military to enforce the Ebola by-laws and get people to comply with the restrictions," said retired Major Alfred Palo Conteh, head of the Ebola response centre. ...more]

http://en.starafrica.com/news/liberia-babies-of-ebola-survivors-to-be-included-in-clinical-research-study.html
[Babies born by Ebola survivors are also to be admitted in the ongoing Ebola Clinical Research being conducted in Liberia by a joint Liberia-US scientific group under the canopy Partnership for Research on Ebola Virus in Liberia (PREVAIL).

According to a Liberian medical scientist, Dr. Jestina Doe-Anderson, who is part of the Community Engagement Sensitization Team of PREVAIL, besides the targeted Ebola survivors who are being given 1st preference to enroll in the study, babies born by those survivors will later be accommodated in the study so as to determine whether they (babies) inherit medical complications being faced by their parents (Ebola survivors).

According to a press statement issued here Thursday (30 Jul 2015), Dr. Doe-Anderson noted that the babies and close contacts of Ebola survivors, including sexual partners, will make up the 7500 people targeted for the research which has so far enrolled close to 400 since the research study was launched in June 2015 in Monrovia and Margibi counties.]

2 Aug 2015: Expert who massively exaggerated Ebola outbreak predictions under fire on claims
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3183111/Expert-massively-exaggerated-Ebola-outbreak-predictions-fire-claims.html#ixzz3hgs6Fq1h
[Last fall (2014), Martin Meltzer (disease modeler for the CDC) calculated that 1.4 million people might contract Ebola in West Africa; his number was 65 times too high.

CDC leaders came to Meltzer early last August (2014), when the epidemic was spiraling out of control and international health officials were quickly trying to build a response. Meltzer was asked to project how bad things could get if nothing was done, as well as to estimate how stepped-up aid could bend the curve of the epidemic. Martin Meltzer and his colleagues (at the CDC) created a spreadsheet tool that projected uninterrupted exponential growth (of Ebola) in 2 countries, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

His prediction -- published last September (2014) -- warned that West Africa could be on track to see 500 000 to 1.4 million Ebola cases within a few months if the world sat on its hands and let the epidemic blaze.

About 21 000 cases materialized by mid-January (2015), a terrible toll to be sure, but also just a tiny fraction of the caseload Meltzer and his CDC colleagues warned about. Today, the epidemic is considered to be on its last legs...

But he and his colleagues clearly stated they were providing a worst-case scenario of how bad things could get. They also predicted a far lower number of cases if more help was sent, which already was happening when the model estimates were released.]
