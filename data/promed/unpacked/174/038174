Wales: Viral Gastroenteritis Outbreak Closes Wards at 2 Hospitals
--------------------------------------------------
A hospital in north Wales has stopped admitting elderly and adult medical
cases after a [viral gastroenteritis outbbreak] hit patients and staff
alike. Now 2 wards have been closed at Ysbyty Glan Clwyd, Bodelwyddan,
while Wrexham Maelor Hospital has also shut 2 wards. Since Sat 1 Mar 2003,
60 more people, 49 of them patients, have been struck down with viral
gastroenteritis at Glan Clwyd. The symptoms are violent vomiting and diarrhoea.

Hospital spokeswoman Dawn Davies said the virus has been in the hospital
for a number of months. However, it has mainly affected wards treating
elderly people until last weekend, when it flared up again. It is not known
exactly how many have been affected at Wrexham Maelor, but hospital
spokesman Andy Scotson said it was "fairly endemic". Mr Scotson blamed the
outbreak on visitors and patients coming into the hospital and spreading
the virus.

Glan Clwyd's Director of Operations Ian Bellingham said: "The hospital
currently has had to close 2 medical wards, and a number of bays on other
wards in medicine and care of the elderly are also out of commission." In
total, half of the medicine and care of the elderly beds are closed -- 95
out of 205 -- due to the outbreak, and the remaining beds are full with
emergency admissions. Mr Bellingham also blamed the increase in cases on
people being admitted to hospital already carrying the virus. The infection
has now spread within the hospital affecting other patients and staff.

Ysbyty Glan Clwyd has now decided not to accept acute admissions for care
of the elderly and adult medicine for the time being, although it is still
taking 999 [i.e. emergency] admissions. The situation is being monitored on
a 4-hourly basis.
