A mysterious algae has been isolated as the source of a water health scare
in South Australia (SA). This particular algae was found to be toxic for
the first time anywhere in the world. SA Water chief scientist Don Bursill
said the blue green algae called _Phormidium_ had never before been found
to be toxic.
But tests on mice yesterday revealed the algae discovered in a water
storage facility on SA's Yorke Peninsula was toxic.
Professor Bursill said scientists needed to establish whether it was a
mutant strain or a different variety of the algae causing the problem or
producing the toxin. "Our information from the literature indicates this
organism has never been found to be toxic at all anywhere in this country
or anywhere else in the world," Prof Bursill said.
"We're looking at our options for trying to determine what this likely
compound or compounds might be," he said. Prof Bursill said colleagues
overseas had been contacted for advice on the algae. Residents of 35 Yorke
Peninsula towns were today receiving free supplies of bottled water.
The discovery prompted South Australia's Human Services Department to
advise against the consumption of mains water and against its use for
cleaning teeth or preparing food.
The Paskeville storage facility was taken out of service and clean filtered
water was being flushed through the mains system from the Morgan water
filtration plant in the Riverland.
Human Services executive director Brendan Kearney said the toxin associated
with the algae was still to be identified along with its possible impact on
human health. But Professor Kearney said there had been no reports of any
illness related to water consumption. "We've undertaken surveys of general
practice on the Yorke Peninsula and those surveys are not turning up any
new or identifiable illnesses in the population," he said.
SA Water chief executive officer Sean Sullivan said the utility was
escalating the flushing program and hoped to have at least one area cleared
by Friday in time for the arrival of tourists for the Easter weekend. "The
rest of the peninsula is going ahead with flushing as soon as is
practically possible," Mr Sullivan said.
"We're aiming to clear the eastern coastal tourist towns by Easter Friday."
The affected area stretched from Moonta in the north to Yorketown in the
south. SA Water was continuing to operate a special hotline number to
answer questions from residents and visitors on 1800 657 337."

Authorities are still baffled by the algal bloom threatening one of South
Australia's (SA) most popular tourist regions.
SA Water, the state's water authority, is struggling to identify the toxin
that has made water undrinkable in a large proportion of Yorke Peninsula.
The cause of the contamination has been isolated to the Paskeville water
storage facility and the algae identified as a _Phormidium_, part of the
blue-green algae family.
SA Water was alerted to a potential problem last Friday when residents
complained about the taste and smell of the mains water. Samples yesterday
revealed the toxic nature of the algae. The Paskeville water store was
taken out of use on Friday and filtered water from the Morgan water
filtration plant has been introduced.
About 10 000 to 15 000 residents of the middle and lower peninsula were
told late on Tuesday not to drink, cook with, brush their teeth with or
gargle the water until further notice. The warnings have since been widened
to include livestock, such as cattle, pigs and sheep. Farmers have been
told that alternate clean water sources such as dams or bores should be used.
The algae symptoms are unknown, but the most likely are diarrhea, vomiting
and headaches. The senior microbiologist for the Department of Human
Services, Dr David Cunliffe, said because scientists were having trouble
identifying the toxin, proposing a treatment was difficult.
"The toxin is new and we really don't know much about it at all ... It was
quite unexpected because that species is generally regarded as not being
toxic." Residents are angry with SA Water for not telling them earlier of
the possible threat to their health. Many heard the warning from media
sources. The water restrictions queries telephone number is 1800 657 337.
