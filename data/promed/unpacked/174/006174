The mystery behind why beaked whales are 'suicidal' may have finally been solved.

Sonar commonly used by America and NATO has been revealed to cause decompression sickness, also known as the bends.

This condition is also known to affect scuba divers and it is believed the condition forces the whales to beach themselves.

Scientists had previously made the link between beached whales and exposure to naval sonar but research has now found the reason why.

The fear and stress from the animals when they hear sonar overrides their natural diving instinct and creates a build-up of nitrogen in the blood, leading to the bends.

In humans this occurs when a diver ascends to the surface too quickly but in whales, it is initiated by fear.

Whales that suffer from this can often die and wash up on a beach several days later, research finds.

Mid-frequency active sonar (MFAS) has been used since the 1960s to detect submarines. They emit underwater signals in a range of about 5 kilohertz (kHz).

This is causing whales, in particular beaked whales, to become scared and swim away from the sound, throwing off their dive pattern.

The fear and stress response overrides the diving response, which creates a build-up of nitrogen in the blood -- which is what happens to scuba divers when they get decompression sickness.

This causes beaked whales, specifically the Cuvier species, to beach. Previously, these were reported as 'suicidal' whales.

Through millions of year of evolution, whales have transformed into diving experts capable of plunging miles below the surface foraging for food. Whales are often able to submerge themselves for hours at a time before needing to return to the surface.

They have trained themselves to slow down their heart rate and restrict blood flow, which conserves oxygen.

But in the presence of sonar beaked whales get scared causing them to react drastically. 'In the presence of sonar, they are stressed and swim vigorously away from the sound source, changing their diving pattern,' said lead research Yara Bernaldo de Quiros, a researcher at the Institute of Animal Health at the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain [see reference below].

There were 121 mass strandings between 1960 and 2004, with at least 40 linked in time and place with naval activities.

Autopsies over several years have revealed that these whales experience decompression illness because of sonar, which is commonly associated with scuba divers.

A build-up of nitrogen in the blood encourages erratic behaviour in the animals and can be fatal.

Often several beaked whales would wash ashore within a day or 2, no more than a dozen kilometres apart.

The deadliest episode was in 2002, when 14 of the animals stranded over a single 36-hour period in the Canary Islands while a NATO naval exercise was occurring. 'Within a few hours of the sonar being deployed, the animals started showing up on the beach,' said Dr de Quiros.

The whales showed no signs of disease or damage on the outside: they had normal body weight and no skin lesions or infections.

However, autopsies revealed they had nitrogen gas bubbles in the veins and their brains were ravaged by haemorrhaging. There was also damage to other organs, as well as damage to the spinal cord and central nervous systems.

A 2003 study in Nature on the possible link between sonar and whale deaths led to Spain banning such naval exercises around the Canary Islands in 2004.

'Up until then, the Canaries were a hotspot for kind strandings,' said Dr de Quiros. 'Since the moratorium, none have occurred.'

Similar bans have been called for in other regions where at-risk whales are known to congregate.

The Cuvier's grows up to 7 metres (23 feet) and eats mainly deep-water squid and fish. Its upwardly turned mouth gives the impression of a permanent smile.

The whale is listed as 'vulnerable' on the IUCN [International Union for Conservation of Nature] Red List of endangered species and is thought to have a global population of 5000 to 7000.

Other threats include ship strikes, ocean pollution, and shifting habitats caused by climate change.

Abstract
--------
"Mass stranding events (MSEs) of beaked whales (BWs) were extremely rare prior to the 1960s but increased markedly after the development of naval mid-frequency active sonar (MFAS). The temporal and spatial associations between atypical BW MSEs and naval exercises were first observed in the Canary Islands, Spain, in the mid-1980s. Further research on BWs stranded in association with naval exercises demonstrated pathological findings consistent with decompression sickness (DCS). A 2004 ban on MFASs around the Canary Islands successfully prevented additional BW MSEs in the region, but atypical MSEs have continued in other places of the world, especially in the Mediterranean Sea, with examined individuals showing DCS. A workshop held in Fuerteventura, Canary Islands, in September 2017 reviewed current knowledge on BW atypical MSEs associated with MFAS. Our review suggests that the effects of MFAS on BWs vary among individuals or populations, and predisposing factors may contribute to individual outcomes. Spatial management specific to BW habitat, such as the MFAS ban in the Canary Islands, has proven to be an effective mitigation tool and mitigation measures should be established in other areas taking into consideration known population-level information."

Beaked whales are the members of the family Ziphiidae, which consists of 23 species. These toothed whales are distinguished by their elongated beaks. The most affected species is the Cuvier's beaked whale, which is one of the most extreme divers, regularly diving for an hour at a depth of over 1000 m (3300 ft).
