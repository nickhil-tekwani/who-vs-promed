State health officials have confirmed 3 new cases of legionnaires' disease linked to the ongoing Hopkins [Minnesota] outbreak, bringing the total number to 20, including one death. In all the cases, including the 3 announced [Tue 27 Sep 2016], patients were exposed to the bacteria in the Hopkins area before [9 Sep 2016] Since then, health officials have taken steps to eliminate possible infection sources; cooling towers on several local businesses were disinfected and a decorative fountain was shut down. State investigators said last week [week of 19 Sep 2016] that they expected the number of cases to grow, but crucially the new cases do not represent disease exposure that happened after remediation steps were taken. It can take up to 10 days for legionnaires' [disease] symptoms to develop, and even then, reporting to state officials can be delayed because some who are infected do not seek treatment immediately.

Legionnaires' disease is contracted by inhaling mist or aerosolized water droplets that contain the _Legionella_ bacteria. Symptoms include cough, fever, and difficulty breathing. In its most severe form, the disease results in a pneumonia that can be fatal to those with compromised immune systems or chronic diseases.

Of the 20 cases, 16 people were sick enough to require hospitalization. The average age of those infected is 59 [years], but at least 1 case occurred in someone in their late 20s. Health Department investigators are still trying to identify how the outbreak started, agency spokesman Doug Schultz said. "We continue to investigate potential sources of the outbreak," Schultz said. "None has been confirmed nor ruled out at this point." While a "few" cases developed in people who visited Hopkins, Schultz said, most cases occurred in people who live or work in the Minneapolis suburb. Disease investigators are interviewing victims, sometimes more than once, in an effort to track their movements and identify a common source.

[We are told that most cases occurred in people who live or work in Hopkins, Minnesota. Hopkins, with a population of 17 591 in 2010, is a suburban city located in Hennepin County, 3 miles west of the city of Minneapolis (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopkins,_Minnesota).

We were told initially that the 1st 6 patients were diagnosed by urinary antigen for _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1 (ProMED-mail post Legionellosis - USA (07): (MN) elderly, comments 20160913.4484996); the absence of an isolate of _Legionella_ in these 6 cases precludes genotyping, but we have not been told if _Legionella_ have been isolated from subsequent cases or if genotyping has been done on these isolates. If the genotypes of clinical isolates match, a common source outbreak can be confirmed and genotyping clinical and environmental isolates can establish transmission pathways.

In addition to acquiring legionnaires' disease by inhaling aerosolized _Legionella_, the disease can be acquired by aspiration of contaminated potable water and possible person-to-person transmission has been described (Correia AM, Gon√ßalves J, Gomes, JP, et al: Probable person-to-person transmission of legionnaires' disease. N Engl J Med. 2016; 374(5): 497-8; http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356). - Mod.ML
