-------------------------------------------------------------
Some comprehensive data should be given to better explain the
newspaper report on the West Nile situation in Lombardy - North Italy.

West Nile virus [WNV] occurred, mainly in horses and wild birds, in
Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna (North Italy) in the fall of 2008, that
is, 10 years after the previous outbreak, which occurred in 1998 in
Tuscany. These outbreaks were recorded during the national monitoring
program based on active and passive surveillance on horses as well as
wild bird and entomological surveillance.

In 2009, WNV reappeared in the same area and spread to neighbouring
areas, involving the same species (horses and wild birds). Some human
cases were also recorded.

The monitoring surveillance programme of 2010 has just started and
till now has not detected any positivity for WNV in mosquitoes,
horses, or wild birds. Anyway we can not exclude viral identification
in the near future, since the WNV circulation may become more evident
later in the summer months.

More specific and detailed information on the cases that occurred
during the last 2 years (2008-2009) in animals and humans has been
published recently:

I hope that these data may be useful to better clarify the situation
on WND in Lombardy and Emilia Romagna regions.

[Dr Cordioli's clarification of the current WNV situation in the
Lombardy and Emilia Romagna regions is much appreciated. It is good
to learn that there is no evidence of WNV circulation in that area
this early in the season this year (2010). One hopes that 2010 will
be a quiet year there for WNV.
