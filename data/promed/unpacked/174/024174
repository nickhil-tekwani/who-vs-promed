SECOND TEAM DEPARTS FOR KENYA TO INVESTIGATE AND CONTROL RIFT VALLEY FEVER
OUTBREAK
The World Health Organization (WHO) has sent a second team to Kenya to work
with the national authorities and international agencies, such as the Food
and Agriculture Organization, the International Federation of Red Cross and
Red Crescent Societies, the International Livestock Research Institute
(ILRI), Medecins Sans Frontiers (Paris), to further investigate the
outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in north-eastern Kenya and develop
control measures.
WHO has had a team working in Kenya since the outbreak was first announced.
The second team arrived in Nairobi on Thursday, 15 January. This team,
which consists of public health specialists in Rift Valley fever, will
coordinate activities in Kenya in the health field, further assess the
extent of the outbreak, strengthen control measures among humans and
animals, and explore the feasibility of immunizing livestock to prevent
further spread.
Specimens have been obtained from sick humans and animals at two different
times by local WHO teams and these have been tested at the WHO
Collaborating Centres at the National Institute of Virology, Johannesburg,
South Africa, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta,
USA. The human tests indicate that at least 13 of the first 36 people
examined were infected with the RVF virus and study of animal specimens has
confirmed that animals are likewise infected.
Access to the outbreak area has been difficult due to the current floods
and the initial WHO investigation was unable to completely clarify the
extent to which other causes have contributed to the high mortality among
both humans and animals. Estimates of human fatalities due to the current
outbreak currently range as high as 450 and it is suspected that other
diseases such as malaria, and possibly cholera, are also contributing to
the high number of deaths.

[Apparently, new cases are now appearing in other Kenyan provinces -
Eastern, Rift Valley, Central and Coast - which includes some national
parks. The movement of livestock to market plus the increased market demand
in preparation for Ramadan celebrations may explain part of this spread.
The current estimated number of deaths in Kenya & Somalia is over 950
deaths; true extent is unknown. - Mod.MHJ
