Mod.TY's original comment in this post read:

"Intramural administration of anticoagulants to cattle, in doses that
do not adversely affect the cattle, can attain blood levels sufficient
to kill vampire bats."

I misunderstood and edited "Intramural" to "Oral." This was not
correct. Intramural means the anticoagulant is injected through the
body wall directly into the rumen.

I apologise to Tom and to our readers.
