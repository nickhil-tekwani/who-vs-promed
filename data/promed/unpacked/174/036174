REPORTS OF V-CJD IN GERMANY
===========================
Date: Fri, 21 Jun 1996 11:11:12 +0200
From: ochmann.frank@stern.de (Frank Ochmann)
Subject: Re: Reports of V-CJD in Germany
Both the "Spiegel" article and my own (STERN, April 3, 1996) were actually
based not on a study but on a TV interview of Prof. Bastian Conrad
(Neurologische Klinik TU M=FCnchen) who made public the case of the 36 year
old cook from Munich who had frequent contact to calf brain since she was
16. The second case published the following day was that of the wife of a
diplomat from Denmark (she was 61 when symptoms started) who had lived in
England for years and who loved to eat beef carpaccio. A relative of her
husband (and therefore no genetic relative to the woman) who had lived in
England with them and who also frequently consumed beef carpaccio had also
died of CJD. This case was made public by Dr. Mario Prosiegel of the
"Neurologisches Krankenhaus Tristanstrasse" also in Munich.
In both cases there has been no evidence for V-CJD. Unfortunately there has
not been performed a biopsy (don't ask me why) so that on the other hand
there seems to be also no evidence that these cases were not V-CJD.
To get an overview on the situation of CJD in Germany you could read for
example the (official) Epidemiological Bulletin of the
Robert-Koch-Institut, No. 16/96
(April 23, 1996) and No. 19/96 (May 14,1996):=20
"There has been no confirmed case of V-CJD in Germany so far."
P.S. For the German speaking (or at least reading) people on ProMED-mail I
include the STERN article on the two mentioned cases.
