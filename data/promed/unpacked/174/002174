SALMONELLA SEROTYPE MARINA, PET IGUANAS
=======================================
Date: Fri, 21 Mar 1997 14:59:20 -0500 (EST)
From: Steve Grenard <grenard@con2.com>
According to a new study published in the journal Pediatrics, 99(3):399-402
(March, 1997) by Mermin, Hoar and Angulo, Salmonella Serotype Marina is
becoming increasingly prevalent, especially among infants and children in
households where pet iguanas and other reptiles may be kept. The objective
of the study was to investigate and document risk factors for S. marina in
the U.S. via a retrospective case study of all isolates of S. marina
reported to the National Salmonella Surveillance System (CDC) for 1994.
32 patients were identified; 81% or 26 cases were in infants less than 1
year old and 75% or 24 cases were in males. 34% or 11 of the patients were
hospitalized for an average of 3.5 days (2-21 days range) and one (1)
patient expired. The majority of cases (88%) involved some sort of exposure
to a pet iguana in the household whereas just 4% of the respondents reported
that the patient actually touched the reptile. This confirms previously
observations that direct contact is NOT necessary to become infected and
that the organism can be present on surfaces or the hands of others and
infect the patient indirectly.
More alarmingly, in spite of national publicity and media coverage, only 43%
or 12 respondents reported that the iguana may be a source of infection in
their children. This is further borne out by the fact that 7 (32%) of 22
families that owned a pet iguana continued to own such a pet after the onset
of the illness, an average of 28 weeks later. Persons who thought the iguana
was the source of the infection were more likely to have either given away
or sold the animal after the onset of illness compared to those who did not.
Between 1990 and 1995 60 nonhuman isolates of S. marina were reported to the
national Veterinary Service Laboratory; 52 in live animal sources, 49 or 94%
of which were from unidentified reptiles.
In the group of humans studies four of the infections were isolated from the
blood (13%). Bacteremia was associated with a history of antibiotic use in
the 30-days prior to the onset of S. marina infection.
The study by Mermin, Hoar and Angulo cited in the previous post concludes
that Salmonella marina, originally identified in 1964 in the Galapagos
Marine Iguana (Amblyrhynchus cristatus) is a potentially serious illness for
humans, particularly those that fall within certain groups such as infants
less than 1, children less than 5 (some may consider 8 yrs) and those
immunocompromised for any reason. It is prudent to add to this list women
who are pregnant because of risk to the fetus and anyone receiving
antibiotics or whose immune system may be compromised while dealing with a
previous infection. It is important to remember, as well, that more than 500
different serovars of Salmonella have been identified in reptiles and that
as many as 50 of these can be pathogenic to humans and have been isolated in
pet iguanas over the past few years. Overgrowth of one type on another may
confound efforts to link cases in humans to presence in reptiles or other
sources in the environment.
What is more disturbing is that a high percentage of parents up to the time
of this study were seemingly oblivious to the risks posed by pet iguanas and
other reptiles in the household. Even though young children and infants
were not permitted to touch or come in contact with these animals, this
study indicates there is clear evidence that their mere presence can cause
the infection to be carried on the hands of others or to be present on
fomites in the household. Prohibiting contact, therefore, is not foolproof
in preventing infection in suspceptible individuals such as children or the
immunocompromised. Handwashing, surface disinfection and other hygienic
measures must be followed whenever dealing with reptiles as well as pet
birds and other animals potentially capable of transmitting Salmonella. The
authors of this paper recommend that any household with individuals at risk
should be devoid of pet reptiles and this is certainly a valid
recommendation given the fact that direct contact is NOT necessary to
transmit infection.
It is the position of this reviewer and responsible members of the
herpetology hobby and scientific profession that education, not legislation
is the best way to combat this problem. There has been a considerable effort
afoot to educate the reptile owning public, pediatricians, the medical
profession in general including hospitals and clinics as well as pet shops
and other categories of live animal dealers (importers, distributors,
wholesalers, private breeders) who can benefit others by the dissemination
of this information.
An example of the educational effort can be found on the Reptile-Associated
Salmonellosis Website offered by the undersigned and which is viewed or hit
approximately a thousand times a week since its inception in 1995. Thousands
of copies have been printed out and distributed and we continue to encourage
use of these guidelines either verbatim, revised, truncated or rewritten for
public dissemination, with or without credit, to HerpMed (Grenard) so long
as the word gets out regarding the risks and what can and should be done to
counteract them.
