Multistate Outbreak of _Salmonella_ Agbeni Infections Linked to Pet Turtles, 2017 (final update)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CDC and multiple states investigated a multistate outbreak of human _Salmonella_ infections linked to contact with pet turtles.

A total of 76 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Agbeni were reported from 19 states.

Illnesses started on dates ranging from [1 Mar 2017 to 1 Dec 2017].

Total / 76

Of 63 people with available information, 30 were hospitalized. No deaths were reported; 24 (32 percent) ill people were children younger than 5.

Epidemiologic and laboratory findings linked this outbreak of human _Salmonella_ Agbeni infections to contact with turtles or their environments, such as water from a turtle habitat. In interviews, ill people answered questions about contact with animals during the week before becoming ill. A total of 23 (38 percent) of the 60 people interviewed reported contact with turtles or their environments, such as water from a turtle habitat, before getting sick. Of the 23 ill people who had contact with turtles, 14 (61 percent) reported contact with small turtles that had a shell length of less than 4 inches. They reported purchasing the turtle from a street vendor or receiving the turtle as a gift.

In 2015, state and local health officials collected samples from turtles at a street vendor. Whole genome sequencing showed that the _Salmonella_ Agbeni isolated from ill people in this outbreak was closely related genetically to the _S._ Agbeni isolates from the turtles at the street vendor. This close genetic relationship means that illnesses in this outbreak were likely linked to turtles.

Whole genome sequencing did not identify predicted antibiotic resistance in 43 of 44 isolates from ill people. One isolate from an ill person had predicted resistance to nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin. The resistance in this isolate is unlikely to affect treatment for most outbreak-associated cases. Testing of 4 outbreak isolates using standard antibiotic susceptibility testing methods by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory did not show any resistance.

Do not buy small turtles as pets or give them as gifts. Since 1975, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has banned selling and distributing turtles with shells less than 4 inches long as pets because they are often linked to salmonellosis, especially in young children.

All turtles, regardless of size, can carry _Salmonella_ bacteria even if they look healthy and clean. These outbreaks are a reminder to follow simple steps to enjoy pet reptiles and keep your family healthy. This outbreak investigation is over. Illnesses could continue because people may not know they could get a Salmonella infection from contact with pet turtles.

[In 2008, CDC reported on an ongoing outbreak of _S._ Paratyphi B var. Java (CDC: _Salmonella_ Infections Associated with Exposure to Turtles -- USA, 2007-2008. Morbid Mortal Weekly Rep 2008; 57(03): 69-72; http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5703a3.htm. Some of the discussion of the report is reproduced below:

"The prohibition on the sale and distribution of small turtles was enacted in 1975, after public health investigations demonstrated that small turtles were a major source of human _Salmonella_ infections, particularly in children. In 1972, a study in New Jersey indicated that small pet turtles accounted for approximately 23 percent of _Salmonella_ infections in children (4). In 1980, the 1975 prohibition was estimated to have prevented 100 000 _Salmonella_ infections in American children each year since going into effect (5). However, this prohibition has an exception: small turtles may be sold legally for scientific, educational, or exhibition purposes. During 2001-2006, the number of turtles kept as pets in the USA increased 86 percent to nearly 2 million turtles (6), suggesting that this exception might provide a mechanism by which small turtles become household pets.

"Turtles, like other reptiles, commonly carry _Salmonella_, and fecal carriage rates can be as high as 90 percent (1). Small turtles sold as pets frequently come from breeding farms, where turtles are housed in crowded ponds and nesting areas in a way that promotes _Salmonella_ transmission (7). Attempts to treat turtles, turtle eggs, and turtle breeding ponds with antibiotics to eliminate _Salmonella_ have not been successful and have resulted in a high prevalence of antibiotic resistance (7,8). Other treatments reduce but do not eliminate shedding from turtles (8), and the turtles that continue to shed might recontaminate other turtles during rearing or shipment. Because shedding might be intermittent and stress related, determining whether turtles are free of the bacteria is difficult (1).

"Direct or indirect contact with a reptile is associated with an estimated 6 percent of human salmonellosis in the USA (9). Persons coming into contact with reptiles, reptile habitats, or surfaces contaminated with reptile fecal matter risk infection from salmonellae shed by the reptile (10). Although most reptiles carry _Salmonella_, small turtles are likely to be handled differently than other reptiles and thus carry a greater risk of transmitting _Salmonella_ to children. In contrast to the obvious risk for a bite or scratch, for example, from a snake or an iguana, a small turtle is likely to be perceived as safe, and thus might be given directly to small children to play with. In addition, a young child placed in charge of caring for a turtle has direct contact with water in the turtle habitat, where salmonellae are likely to multiply to high numbers. Although approximately half of the infections associated with this outbreak occurred in young children, who are at greater risk for severe illness from salmonellosis (2,10), several illnesses occurred in adults with turtle exposure, demonstrating that turtle-associated salmonellosis is not unique to children. Additionally, only 20 percent of case-patients interviewed reported awareness of the link between salmonellosis and contact with reptiles, indicating that measures to educate the public about this link have not been successful. CDC has provided recommendations to prevent reptile-associated salmonellosis in humans (2). However, because of the particular hazard associated with small turtles, prohibiting the sale and distribution of small turtles likely remains the most effective public health action to prevent turtle-associated salmonellosis.
