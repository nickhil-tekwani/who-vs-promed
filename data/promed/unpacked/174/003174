HANTAVIRUS UPDATE 2010 - AMERICAS (07): CHILE

Hantavirus[es] have been detected [in southern South America]
beginning in 1995, with the Andes virus the only species identified in
the country [Chile] to date.

Hantaviruses are RNA, single stranded with circular 3-[prime] strands,
and belong to the Bunyaviridae family. They are transmitted by contact
with wild rodents [excreta] and in humans produce 2 types of effects:
hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome described in Europe and Asia;
hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome [HPS], which is found
fundamentally in the Americas from Canada to the south of the
continent, Chile and Argentina.

Many varieties [species] of hantaviruses have been described in the
Americas. In Chile and southern Argentina, the Andes species
circulates, described for the 1st time in the El Bolson border region
in the south of Argentina in mid 1995. Its principal reservoir is the
rodent _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_ (most commonly known as the "raton
colilargo" [long-tailed pigmy rice rat in English]). Its presence has
been detected in most of Chile from region III-XI, fundamentally in
rural areas.

In humans, this virus causes respiratory disease known as
cardiopulmonary syndrome, with an overall mortality around 30 percent
in the country. While the 1st case described in Chile occurred in
1995, cases have been detected retrospectively in Valdivia (1993) and
Puerto Montt (1975). Up to the present, the Ministry of Health in
Chile has reported a total of 628 cases, including the retrospective
ones, with a case fatality rate of 35 percent.

During 2009, 34 cases of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome were
confirmed in Chile, with a case fatality rate that reached 26 percent
(9 deaths). These cases had the following [geographic] distribution:
one in the Metropolitan Region (capital city of the country), 3 in
Region VI, 5 in Region VII, 10 in Region VIII, 7 in Region IX, one in
Region XIV, 4 in Region X and 3 in Region XI.

During this year [2010], 10 new cases have presented, confirmed by the
Institute of Public Health of Chile (National Reference Laboratory): 8
in January 2010, and 2 so far in February 2010. Of these, 4 have died
(case fatality rate so far of 40 percent). The cases have been
distributed as follows: 3 in the Bio Bio Region (VIII), 3 in the
Araucania Region (IX), 4 in the Los Lagos Region (X), and one in the
Coihaique Region (XI), that is to say all in the extreme southern part
of the country.

All the cases have been confirmed by means of serological tests, with
high IgM antibody titers specific for hantaviruses. Only 2 of these
also had positive [serological] reactions with IgG antibodies.

Chile's Ministry of Health maintains the classification of suspected
cases in its weekly report and has strengthened a preventive
information campaign by radio and television beginning on 8 Feb
[2010], a campaign that it habitually initiates in November of each
year, which coincides with the seasonal increase that is expected for
this disease and which is associated with the summer season in our
country.

[ProMED is grateful to Drs Garcia and Villagra for their report, which
raises the 2010 total of new HPS cases to 10. Information and
perspectives from health providers in the field are particularly
valuable, and ProMED welcomes them.
