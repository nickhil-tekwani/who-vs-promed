Queensland Health is continuing to investigate an outbreak of an enterohemorrhagic Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ (EHEC) in Brisbane. So far, 32 people are confirmed to have EHEC, and a further 103 samples are being tested for the infection from people who may potentially have the infection. Five people have been hospitalized and have since been discharged.

Acting Senior Director Communicable Diseases Unit Dr Stephen Lambert said there had been a significant response to the outbreak, which has led to a large number of people undergoing testing for the infection.

"The community's response has been great. People have been listening and seeking medical treatment if they have symptoms," Dr Lambert said. This, combined with the medical community's response, has meant that a significant number of cases of gastroenteritis are under investigation. "I thank everyone for their response to this important public health issue to assist in preventing any further outbreak."

For those scientific types interested in this issue, _E. .coli_ O157 is the specific strain that caused this outbreak.
