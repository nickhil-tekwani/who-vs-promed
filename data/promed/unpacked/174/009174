[Vesicular stomatitis (VS) is one of a group of clinically
indistinguishable vesicular diseases of livestock which include foot and
mouth disease (FMD), vesicular exanthema of swine, and swine vesicular
disease. Horses are susceptible to VS, but they are not affected by FMD.
The disease is caused by a Vesiculovirus in the family Rhaboviridae,
transmitted by hematophagous insects such as _Culicoides_ (sand flies) and
_Simuliidae_ (black flies), and occurs in tropical and subtropical North
and South America. - Mod.PC]
