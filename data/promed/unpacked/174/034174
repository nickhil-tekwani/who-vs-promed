[1] COVID-19 in younger populations and children
[A] Israel: hospitalization rate

The number of Israel's hospitalized COVID-19 patients under the age of 60 has overtaken the number of patients of that age and over, data from the Our World in Data website [see comment below; https://ourworldindata.org/vaccination-israel-impact] show, in a further indication of the widespread vaccination campaign starting to show its effect. The figures are similar for the number of serious patients.

Some 80% of Israelis over 60 have been immunized, and hospitalizations among that population have been going sharply down since mid-January [2021]. Younger Israelis have been proving more hesitant to get the shot. Tel Aviv's Ichilov Hospital has tweeted these stats and calls on all Israelis to vaccinate.

[The data for the report above came from Mathieu and Ritchie (Mathieu E, Ritchie H. Vaccinations and the impact of COVID-19 -- our continuously-updated data for Israel. Our World in Data. Epub 8 Feb 2021. https://ourworldindata.org/vaccination-israel-impact), and portions are excerpted below.

"Israel has conducted the fastest campaign to vaccinate its population against COVID-19 so far. The world is now watching how the pandemic in the country evolves to assess whether vaccinations are having the intended effect, and how effective they might be in preventing infection, severe disease and death.

"To answer the question of how the vaccination campaign impacts the evolution of COVID-19 requires a thorough analysis based on an epidemiological model. All we can do here is to present some relevant data to track what is happening. Note that the changes in case rates, hospitalizations and deaths cannot be solely attributed to the impact of vaccination.

"To be able to track the development of the pandemic in Israel, we show the data on vaccinations, confirmed cases, hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and deaths in the following charts. The data presented below comes from multiple sources:

- Data on vaccinations, confirmed cases, and hospitalizations by age and by geographical group (early or late vaccination) comes from the work of Hagai Rossman, Smadar Shilo, Tomer Meir et al. (see reference below). These data will be updated weekly.
- Data on total vaccinations (from our global dataset on vaccinations) and confirmed cases and deaths (from Johns Hopkins University) is updated daily.
- Data on confirmed cases by age group, and on hospitalizations and ICU admissions, comes from the Israeli government and is updated weekly."

"Studies on the real-life impact of the BNT162b2 vaccine, recently authorized for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), are urgently needed. Here, we analysed the temporal dynamics of the number of new COVID-19 cases and hospitalization in Israel following a vaccination campaign initiated on 20 Dec 2020. We conducted a retrospective analysis of data originating from the Israeli Ministry of Health (MOH) from March 2020 -- February 2021. In order to distill the possible effect of the vaccinations from other factors, including a 3rd lockdown imposed in Israel on January 2021, we compared the time-dependent changes in number of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations between (1) individuals aged 60 years and older, eligible to receive the vaccine earlier, and younger individuals (0-59 years old); (2) early-vaccinated cities compared to late-vaccinated cities; (3) early-vaccinated geographical statistical areas (GSAs) compared to late-vaccinated GSAs; and (4) the current lockdown versus the previous lockdown, imposed on September 2020. By 6 Feb 2021, 45.3% and 29.7% of the entire Israeli population (89.9% and 80% of individuals older than 60 years old) received the 1st dose or both doses of the vaccine, respectively, or recovered from COVID-19. In mid-January [2021], the number of COVID-19 cases and hospitalization started to decline, with a larger and earlier decrease among older individuals. This trend was more evident in early-vaccinated compared to late-vaccinated cities. Such a pattern was not observed in the previous lockdown. Our analysis demonstrates evidence for the real-life effectiveness of a national vaccination campaign in Israel on the pandemic dynamics. This report reflects a snapshot of a fast-changing situation. However, we believe our findings have major public health implications in the struggle against the COVID-19 pandemic, including the public's perception of the need for and benefit of nationwide vaccination campaigns. More studies aimed at assessing the effectiveness of vaccination both on the individual and on the population level, with larger followup are needed."

With the impressive vaccination rate of 80% of those over 60 years of age, it is not surprising that younger individuals are experiencing the greatest effect of virus circulation and becoming infected and hospitalized at a rate surpassing the older population. This is reassuring that the vaccine is protective, although it is now important to vaccinate the younger age population as well. - Mod.LK]

[B] Long COVID (persisting symptoms)

Citation: Buonsenso D, Munblit D, De Rose C, et al. Preliminary evidence on long COVID in children. MedRxiv. Epub 26 Jan 2021. https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.23.21250375

Abstract: There is increasing evidence that adult patients diagnosed with acute COVID-19 suffer from long COVID initially described in Italy. To date, data on long COVID in children are lacking. We assessed persistent symptoms in pediatric patients previously diagnosed with COVID-19. More than half reported at least one persisting symptom even after 120 days since COVID-19, with 42.6% being impaired by these symptoms during daily activities. Symptoms like fatigue, muscle and joint pain, headache, insomnia, respiratory problems and palpitations were particularly frequent, as also described in adults. The evidence that COVID-19 can have long-term impact children as well, including those with asymptomatic/paucisymptomatic COVID-19, highlights the need for pediatricians, mental health experts and policy makers of implementing measures to reduce impact of the pandemic on [children's] heath.

Discussion: To our knowledge, this is the 1st study providing evidence of long COVID in children. More than half reported at least one persisting symptom even after 120 days since COVID-19, with 42.6% being impaired by these symptoms during daily activities. Symptoms like fatigue, muscle and joint pain, headache, insomnia, respiratory problems and palpitations were particularly frequent, as also described in adults (1,2). Limitations of the study include the single-center design with a relatively small sample size. All patients were interviewed once; however, this study is designed to continue periodic assessments until 24 months after COVID-19 diagnosis and to include household members of different age groups, with or without COVID-19 as a control group. Children have been mostly overlooked during this pandemic, since the clinical course of COVID-19 in this group is much milder than in adults (4). However, there is increasing evidence that restrictive measures aimed at limiting the pandemic are having a significant impact on [children's] mental health (5). Childhood is a delicate and fundamental period of life, critical for acquisition of social, behavioral and educational development. The evidence that COVID-19 can have long-term impact children as well, including those with asymptomatic/paucisymptomatic COVID-19, highlights the need for pediatricians, mental health experts and policy makers of implementing measures to reduce impact of the pandemic on [children's] health.

Children are clearly suffering unintended consequences from this pandemic, even with milder symptoms being more common. They are missing the basic human interactions with their peers, extended families, and teachers -- so important to their development. The preventative measures adopted to curtail virus spread has disrupted nearly every aspect of their lives. With this report on children also experiencing persistence of physical symptoms following infection, it is important that they be followed closely since fatigue and other non-specific symptoms were noted that could be caused by the virus or psychological effects of being isolated. - Mod.LK]

[2] China: possible early COVID-19 cases
Date: Wed 10 Feb 2021 19:00 EST
Source: The Wall Street Journal [abridged, edited]
https://www.wsj.com/articles/possible-early-covid-19-cases-in-china-emerge-during-who-mission-11612996225


About 90 people were hospitalized with COVID-19-like symptoms in central China in the 2 months before the disease was first identified in Wuhan in late 2019, according to World Health Organization (WHO) investigators, who said they pressed Beijing to allow further testing to determine whether the new virus was spreading earlier than previously known.

Chinese authorities performed antibody tests on about two-thirds of those patients in the past 2 months, according to the investigators, and said they found no trace of infection by the virus. But members of the WHO team probing the pandemic's origins said any antibodies could have subsided to undetectable levels during the delay.

"Further studies are needed," said Peter Ben Embarek, the food-safety scientist who led the WHO team, which wrapped up a 4-week visit to China on Wednesday [10 Feb 2021].

Team members said they urged China to conduct wider tests on blood samples collected in autumn 2019 around Hubei, the province that is home to Wuhan, to look for evidence about when the virus was first circulating. Chinese authorities said they hadn't yet obtained necessary permissions to test samples, many of which are held in blood banks, WHO investigators said.

China's disclosures to the WHO raise questions about the possibility that COVID-19 -- which has now killed more than 2.3 million people -- was already spreading in China in October 2019 and that earlier detection could have helped contain the outbreak before it became a global pandemic. Beijing says the 1st patient identified in China developed symptoms on 8 Dec 2019.

Liang Wannian, head of the COVID-19 expert panel for China's National Health Commission, said Tuesday [9 Feb 2021] that Chinese authorities had tested blood samples for antibodies, and checked medical records from 233 hospitals and clinics, but hadn't found evidence of the virus spreading around Wuhan before early December 2019.

There had been no unexpected fluctuations in mortality levels from pneumonia or other illness in the preceding months, he said, and sales of cough and cold medicine didn't provide useful indicators either.

During the WHO delegation's visit, investigators said they received medical records from Chinese authorities related to about 92 cases of people from the 233 institutions canvassed by Chinese authorities across Hubei. All 92 had suffered from pneumonia or other COVID-19-like symptoms. Chinese authorities subjected those patients to antibody tests in recent months.

About one-third had died or refused to participate, said Dr. Embarek. The rest tested negative in serology tests that look for antibodies, he and other team members said.

"The numbers are not so important. What is important is that we don't really know how reliable serology testing is to detect antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 more than a year after infection," Dr. Embarek said. Another WHO researcher, microbiologist Fabian Leendertz, said the probability of finding antibodies that late would be low.

Marion Koopmans, a Dutch virologist on the WHO team, echoed that concern. "From what we know about serology, out of 92 cases you would at least have some positives," she said. "Antibodies do clear. The levels go down, but less so in cases of severe infection."

If the 90 cases included COVID-19 infections, it could help explain suspected coronavirus cases that researchers believe occurred in Europe and possibly the USA in November and December 2019.

In a recent study, Italian researchers found evidence of COVID-19 infection in a 4-year-old boy from the Milan area who was treated for respiratory symptoms and vomiting on 30 Nov 2019. Researchers found RNA exactly matching part of the COVID-19 virus while retrospectively testing a respiratory specimen from the boy, along with specimens from other patients.

There might also have been a few cases of COVID-19 in the mission.

The WHO had hoped to see antibody tests of any individuals in the Wuhan area hospitalized with COVID-19-like symptoms in the days before the 1st known case. Such tests could have indicated an infection -- and provided a vital clue had they been conducted much earlier than last month [January 2021].

The delay left the WHO team more dependent on blood samples taken around November 2019 and stored since then in Chinese hospitals or blood banks. But the available samples weren't representative of the population, team members said, adding that they disproportionately included children, which offers little clue as to early COVID-19 transmission.

Further systematic studies of blood samples would help establish whether the virus was spreading in China before December 2019.

"It's easy to suggest, but it's not easy to do that," Dr. Koopmans said, citing Chinese authorities' statements that they hadn't secured permission for such testing. "It's something that was discussed and there was certainly an interest on the Chinese side."

Thea Fischer, a Danish epidemiologist on the WHO team, also said she had recommended a systematic serological study on a representative part of the healthy population, such as those performed in several other countries, as one step that "would bring us closer to a potential circulation in the population earlier."

She said she had asked to meet the Wuhan blood-donor center and established during the meeting that samples were available that officials were open to the idea of a future joint [testing].

Researchers said it was also important to find whether any respiratory or other patient specimens were saved that could be tested for COVID-19.

It would not be surprising if cases were occurring earlier than originally suspected since it takes a certain number of severe cases and deaths to alert physicians that there is a problem. But the finding that an unstated proportion of one-third of the 92 patients with pneumonia or other COVID-19-like symptoms had died should have set off alarms to conduct tests to determine etiology. It is difficult to retest patients now since antibody is not long lasting. But a serologic survey of the population may give an indication of the level of circulation of the virus within at least the past 6 months. If patient specimens were kept from the time of onset of symptoms of these patients, they would be valuable resource to test now. - Mod.LK]

[3] Australia: nebulizer-associated spread
Date: Thu 11 Feb 2021 01:12 EST
Source: Bloomberg News [abridged, edited]
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/nebulizer-that-vaporized-virus-started-new-australia-outbreak


A cluster of the virulent [strain of coronavirus first reported in the UK] in Australia rose to 11 on Thursday [11 Feb 2021], with authorities saying it started in a Melbourne quarantine hotel by a person who used a nebulizer to treat a health condition.

The medical device, which vaporizes medication or liquid, also worked to spread the virus through mist "suspended in the air with very, very fine aerosolized particles," said Victoria state Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton. This was how the virus was carried out of the hotel room into the corridor, where staff walking the halls were exposed, he said.

The outbreak is yet another example of the insidious ways that SARS-CoV-2 can spread, stymieing even countries with the strictest travel and containment regimes in the world. The outbreak is raising concern that Australia's quarantine system, in which many overseas arrivals must stay in designated hotels in major cities for 14 days, must be reinforced or redesigned as more virulent strains of the virus spread worldwide.

Infectious particles expelled from an infected person's nose and mouth are thought to be the main source of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although larger respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes are the main source of transmission, a growing body of evidence is implicating smaller aerosol particles that can float in the air further and longer.

In light of that, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began recommending this week that Americans wear either a cloth mask with multiple layers of fabric or a surgical mask beneath a cloth one to improve protection against the coronavirus.

In Melbourne, authorities believe the virus spread from the nebulizer used by a person in a family of 3 quarantined in the hotel, to at least 6 other people.

While testing for the virus has ramped up in Australia's 2nd-largest city and investigators seek to track and isolate all contacts of the hotel workers, other regions are wary of contagion: South Australia state has announced it is blocking arrivals from Melbourne.

Melbourne, which is currently hosting the Australian Open Grand Slam tennis tournament, last year [2020] endured one of the world's strictest and longest lockdowns, which confined the city's 5 million residents to their homes for more than 3 months.

Australia, which has recorded fewer than 29 000 cases of COVID-19 since the pandemic began, has come close to eliminating community transmission of the virus through strict controls on travel, vigilant contact tracing methods, and testing.

"This new, more infectious [strain first reported in the UK] has blown open cracks in our hotel quarantine system, putting the nation at risk," Omar Khorshid, president of the Australian Medical Association, said in a statement. "Alternatives must be found now that will allow some travel in and out of Australia whilst protecting all Australians from this virus."

This source of virus spread suggests masks must be worn all the time, even in a room with family members when aerosol-producing procedures are conducted. In quarantine hotels where travelers have arrived from all over the world, certainly good quality masks as recommended by the CDC and frequent hand washing should be the rule. - Mod.LK]

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (100 288), Brazil (49 396), and France (20 701) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 15 303 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 11 Feb 2021 to late 12 Feb 2021).

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (9 countries) include the USA, Brazil, France, the UK (15 144), Russia (15 089), Spain (14 581), Italy (13 908), India (12 137), and Mexico (10 677). A total of 52 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 27 of the 52 countries are from the European region, 11 are from the Americas region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 3 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 1.3%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 9.5%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 21.8% decrease in daily reported cases and 6.1% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported cases were over 400 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 108.7 million cumulative reported cases and over 2.39 million reported deaths. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, even in the face of overall decreasing reports. The Eastern Mediterranean countries have been demonstrating decreasing case counts while the Western Pacific and African countries are increasing in reported cases. - Mod.UBA]
