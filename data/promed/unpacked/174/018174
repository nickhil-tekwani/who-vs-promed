Bitterroot bighorn pneumonia outbreak worsens
---------------------------------------------
An outbreak of pneumonia in bighorn sheep from the East Fork
Bitterroot herd worsened over the past week.

State wildlife biologists collected almost 30 infected bighorn sheep
from the area south of Darby. Some of the infected animals were shot
in an effort to slow the spread of the disease. Others were found
already dead.

"Any hope for a moderate infection rate is waning," said Craig
Jourdonnais, the Bitterroot-based biologist for Montana Fish, Wildlife
and Parks [FWP]. "I think we are in full blown die-off mode."

Last week [week of 23 Nov 2009], biologists confirmed that sheep from
the herd were infected with the nearly always fatal respiratory
disease after 2 rams were discovered dead along the road.

In the past, some bighorn herds infected with pneumonia in Montana
have seen dramatic die-offs in the 60-70 percent range.

The East Fork bighorn sheep herd was established in 1972 when 35 sheep
were transplanted there. Last spring [2009], Jourdonnais counted 185
during an aerial survey.

[But according to Tom Keegan, Fish and Game's Salmon Regional Wildlife
Manager, "The East Fork herd is a rarity in that it was never
extirpated, meaning today's sheep have the same genetics as those that
existed in the drainage before settlement."
<http://www.mtexpress.com/index2.php?ID=2005121832>, and " Unlike the
Hells Canyon area, wild bighorns were never fully extirpated in the
Salmon [River] drainage. No transplants have been made into the Salmon
River drainages where bighorns now live. Today?s populations are all
genetically derived from original bighorn populations present when
human settlement of the area took place in the 1800?s." -- see para.16

Jourdonnais and other state biologists will continue to cull sick
sheep from the herd this week and collect biological samples for
testing.

"It appears to be pretty extensive at this point," Jourdonnais said.
"On Sunday [29 Nov 2009], we headed up into nearby draws. We found a
lot of coughing sheep."

The disease is impacting the entire herd. "It's an all-age thing," he
said. "We're finding infected lambs all the way up to mature ewes and
rams. It's across the board."

Necropsies found lesions on the animals' lungs. In some of the worst
cases, the animal's lung lining was adhered to the rib case.

Jourdonnais said he's found sheep that were too weak to stand. Others
in earlier stages of infection are able to take just a few steps
before stopping. "They are laboring just to move," he said.

The biologist has found a few small herds away from the main wintering
area that appear healthy at this point. "We're holding hope that maybe
they'll keep to themselves and not get infected," he said.

Jourdonnais said the public has been helpful in helping biologists
locate the ailing sheep. "The Doyle family has been top notch to work
with," he said. Local sportsmen have offered to help collect samples
from dead bighorns over the next few weeks. "Logistically, we can use
the help," Jourdonnais said. "It takes a good deal of time to collect
the samples we need."

The samples are sent to the FWP laboratory in Bozeman where they are
used to identify the pathogen and could potentially help biologists
locate the source of the disease.

There are no known vaccines to prevent pneumonia in wild sheep. "At
this point, direct removal of infected animals is our best tool,"
Jourdonnais said. "We're going to try to contain it as best we can."

It's a bad time of the year for the disease to show up in bighorn
sheep. The rams are in the rut and are on the move. "They are highly
social animals," Jourdonnais said. "They are touching each other,
licking each other, and combating with each other. Behavior-wise they
are not helping themselves at all."

[While there are no vaccines shown to be efficacious in wild sheep,
one wonders if providing feeding areas with oral medication would be
helpful. Of course that also has the danger of attracting those groups
that have been isolated and risks exposing them. It is a difficult
position for the biologist.
