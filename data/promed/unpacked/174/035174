Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: A febrile disease was reported in mid-June [2017]. Nasal swabs and blood samples were collected from suspected stables. Equine influenza is not common in Israel and was not detected since [November 2013.] The samples were sent for confirmation to the OIE reference laboratory.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; vaccination in response to the outbreak (s); surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; screening,; quarantine; zoning; disinfection; no treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Kimron Veterinary Institute (National laboratory) / Equidae / real-time PCR / 26 Jun 2017 / Positive
Irish Equine Center - Ireland (OIE Reference Laboratory) / Equidae/ reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)/ 15 Jul 2017 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

["Equine influenza is an acute respiratory infection of horses, donkeys, mules and zebras caused by two distinct subtypes (H7N7, formerly equi-1, and H3N8, formerly equi2) of influenza A virus within the genus Influenzavirus A of the family Orthomyxoviridae. Viruses of the H7N7 subtype have not been isolated since the late 1970s. Equine influenza viruses of both subtypes are considered to be of avian ancestry and highly pathogenic avian H5N1 has been associated with an outbreak of respiratory disease in donkeys in Egypt. In fully susceptible equidae, clinical signs include pyrexia and a harsh dry cough followed by a mucopurulent nasal discharge. In partially immune vaccinated animals, one or more of these signs may be absent. Vaccinated infected horses can still shed the virus and serve as a source of virus to their cohorts."

"Characteristically, influenza spreads rapidly in a susceptible population. The disease is endemic in many countries with substantial equine populations. In recent years, infection has been introduced into Australia and re-introduced into South Africa and Japan; to date New Zealand and Iceland are reported to be free of equine influenza virus."

"While normally confined to equidae, equine H3N8 influenza has crossed the species barrier to dogs. Extensive infection of dogs has been reported in North America where it normally produces mild fever and coughing but can cause fatal pneumonia. While equine influenza has not been shown to cause disease in humans, serological evidence of infection has been described primarily in individuals with an occupational exposure to the virus. During 2004-2006 influenza surveillance in central China (People's Rep. of) 2 equine H3N8 influenza viruses were also isolated from pigs."

For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2017, Chapter 2.5.7, Equine Influenza at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.05.07_EQ_INF.pdf. - Mod CRD]

[According to OIE's epidemiological data from Israel, covering the period 2005 - 2016, Equine influenza virus H3N8 has been recorded from Israel in Jun 2006, Jan 2007 and Nov 2013.

However the virus may have circulated in additional years. This is apparent from the findings presented in Reference 1. During the winter 2011-2012, the authors found in Israel 26.4 percent seroprevalence and 6.4 percent seroconversion to H3N8 and, respectively, 16.4 percent and 1 percent seroprevalence and seroconversion to H7N7. (Notably, H7N7 influenza viruses have not been detected in Israel's horse population since the late 1970s).

The current outbreak, spread throughout the country, is indeed remarkable; the virus is probably more common in Israel than assumed before. - Mod AS
