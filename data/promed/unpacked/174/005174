The Ministry of National Economy reports, [8 hospitalized inhabitants of Karaganda have been diagnosed with anthrax; 2 deaths have been registered as of 27 Jun 2016, in Yerkindik [Erkindik] village.] The sick people are receiving treatment in the regional infection hospital.

The source of the infection was a sick cow. The people were infected after butchering it without veterinary control and selling the meat to 11 families in the village. The animal could have been infected in a nearby pasture with a free standing animal burial site and ineffective vaccination.

Prime Minister of Kazakhstan Karim Massimov has tasked the Government to tighten control of anthrax burial sites in the country. "Yesterday [27 Jun 2016] we held a session dedicated to the anthrax outbreak in Karaganda region. The security at the anthrax burial sites spins out of control. We need to sort this problem out. I gave the corresponding instruction yesterday," said Prime Minister Massimov addressing Minister of Agriculture Askar Myrzakhmetov at the session of the Kazakh Government on [Tue 28 Jun 2016].

Minister Myrzakhmetov is set to coordinate the issue together with akims (governors) of the regions. "We will focus on this issue at the onset of the next session of the Government," Massimov promised.

The head of the Government stressed that all anthrax burial sites in Kazakhstan, not only in Karaganda region, must be strictly controlled. He also touched upon the lack of veterinary control in the regions at the session.

[The Prime Minister has spoken and the Minister of Agriculture has stated that action will be actively discussed at the next Government session. In the meanwhile, one can hope that veterinary activity will be upgraded and livestock owners made more aware of the dangers of butchering sick animals without supervision. In fact the Kazakh national incidence of anthrax had been radically reduced. I suspect that this added layer of senior oversight may well take the control programme home successfully. Over the years I have seen a number of successful control programmes fail because when they reach that terminal stage of not much happening, it is prematurely switched off and funding removed, and back it comes. This Prime Minister interest can be mobilised productively. - Mod.MHJ
