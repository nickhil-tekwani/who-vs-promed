CWD found for 1st time in Iowa
--------------
A white-tailed deer at a hunting preserve in Iowa has tested positive for chronic wasting disease - the 1st such case in Iowa. Here's more from an Iowa DNR (Iowa Department of Natural Resources) news release:

The positive sample was verified this week, and DNR is working closely with the State Veterinarian on this isolated incident. There is no evidence that CWD can spread to humans, pets or domestic livestock such as pork, beef, dairy, poultry, sheep or goats.

The Davis County facility where the animal was held has been inspected by the Iowa DNR and Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship (IDALS) to ensure that any remaining deer remain contained. The facility is surrounded by an 8-foot fence. A quarantine has also been issued for the facility.

"Given all of Iowa's surrounding states have confirmed cases of CWD, Iowa DNR was prepared to address this isolated incident," said DNR Deputy Director Bruce Trautman.

The DNR and IDALS have a CWD response plan in place to address the disease.

"We have a CWD surveillance program in place to test deer, elk and moose at the facilities that raise farm deer and we have worked closely with DNR to plan for a possible finding of the disease," said Iowa State Veterinarian Dr. David Schmitt.

Iowa has tested 42 557 wild deer and over 4000 captive deer and elk as part of the surveillance program since 2002 when CWD was found in Wisconsin.

The DNR will increase testing of wild deer in the area by working with hunters and landowners to collect samples from hunter harvested deer beginning this fall.

CWD is a neurological disease that only affects deer, elk and moose. It is caused by an abnormal protein, called a prion, which affects the brains of infected animals, causing them to lose weight, display abnormal behavior and lose bodily functions. Signs include excessive salivation, thirst and urination, loss of appetite, progressive weight loss, listlessness and drooping ears and head. The prions can attach to soil and spread the disease among deer. Chronic wasting disease was 1st identified in captive mule deer at a research facility in Colorado in 1967. Prior to the positive detection in Iowa, CWD had been detected in every bordering state.

Chronic wasting disease-affected deer and elk show loss of body condition and changes in behavior. The clinical disease is often more subtle and prolonged in elk than in deer. Affected animals may walk repetitive courses; they may show subtle ataxia and wide based stance; subtle head tremors occur in some animals; they may be found near water sources or in riparian areas; they may have periods of somnolence; and they may carry their head and ears lowered. Chronic wasting disease affected animals continue to eat but amounts of feed consumed are reduced, leading to gradual loss of body condition. Excessive drinking and urination are common in the terminal stages because of specific lesions in the brain. Many animals in terminal stages of CWD have excessive salivation and drooling; this may result in wetting of the hairs of the chin and neck. Death is inevitable once clinical disease occurs. The clinical course of CWD varies from a few days to approximately a year, with most animals surviving from a few weeks to several months.

Clinical signs of CWD alone are not diagnostic and definitive diagnosis is based on examination of the brain for spongiform lesions and/or accumulation of the CWD associated protease resistant protein (PrPCWD) in brain and lymphoid tissues by immunohistochemistry. This test is based on use of monoclonal antibodies and chromogens to detect accumulation of PrPCWD in various tissues.
