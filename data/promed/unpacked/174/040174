Information on dead seals in 2007:
Status report No. 8: update on the current seal epidemic (24 Aug 2007)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Up to 22 Aug 2007, just more than 90 seals have died along the
Swedish west coast up to the Tanum Municipality. The ultimate cause
of death was pneumonia in all cases. We get daily reports of single
cases in the entire area, which means that the disease is still
present in Swedish waters all the way from southern Kattegat and northwards.
It was said in the 7th status report that the Swedish Museum of
Natural History was awaiting sequencing results from IAH [Institute
for Animal Health, England]. This is not correct. The tested samples
were proven negative for PDV [phocine distemper virus], which means
that PDV is not the likely infective agent causing the current seal epidemic.

[This event illuminates the importance of involving specialised
laboratories in investigations of animal diseases, from their onset.
It remains to be found out what was/is the etiology of the mortality
in Swedish seals, apparently manifested by pneumonia. - Mod.AS]
