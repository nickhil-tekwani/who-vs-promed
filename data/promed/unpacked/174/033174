Mosquitoes trapped in 2 locations by the Gem County Mosquito Abatement District tested positive for St Louis encephalitis virus [SLEV].

Both areas are being treated, but efforts are being hampered by weather.

It's unusual to find the virus in Idaho. According the Center for Disease Control, most cases have occurred in eastern and central states. Most people infected with SLEV show no symptoms. Those who do become ill experience flu-like symptoms -- fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue.

The more severe version of the disease involves inflammation of the brain, and occurs most commonly in older adults. Cases involving death or long-term disability are extremely rare.

To reduce your risk of being infected use insect repellent, wear protective clothing, stay indoors while mosquitoes are active, make sure window screens are secure and eliminate standing water on your property.

[This is the 1st report ProMED-mail has posted of St Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) detection in Idaho. Finding the virus here is not surprising, since the virus has been isolated in a variety of states across the USA. This year (2017), active St Louis encephalitis [SLE] virus transmission is occurring in several locations in California. Wild birds are the reservoir host and mosquitoes in the genus _Culex_ are vectors that transmit SLE virus. The mosquito species in which SLEV was detected are not mentioned in the report above. Avoidance of mosquito bites is good advice that should be heeded by the local residents.

The state of Idaho can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=5329209,20243. Gem county in western Idaho can be seen on the map at http://geology.com/county-map/idaho-county-map.gif. - Mod.TY]
