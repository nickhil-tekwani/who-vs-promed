There is some "real science" being applied to this problem. Both the
National Animal Disease Laboratory (NADL) and the National Veterinary
Services Laboratory, diagnostics, (NVSL) are participating in a multi-year
study of Brucellosis in bison in the Yellowstone area. One of the
diagnostic assays being used differentiates between the antibodies raised
by the Strain 19 vaccine and the wild/street strains. Because the study has
a year or two yet to run, I don't believe that any of the work completed to
date has been published.
Dr. Norm Chavelle (sp?) of NADL has developed a new cattle vaccine for
brucellosis based on Strain RB51 that protects cattle from challenge but
the vaccine does not raise detectable antibodies in cattle. By the way,
there is also considerable cross reactivity between strains of _Brucella_
spp. from different species in the serological diagnostics currently in use
in the field. The work was done some time ago to demonstrate infectivity of
isolates from multiple species, bison, elk, deer, etc., in cattle.
