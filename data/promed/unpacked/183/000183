178 enterovirus cases reported in Macao
---------------------------------------
A total of 178 enterovirus cases, including 17 EV 71 infections, have been
confirmed in Macao to date, the Department of Heath (SSM) of the Macao
Special Administrative Region (SAR) announced on Thursday [15 May 2008].
The SSM said in a press statement that 12 new enterovirus cases, comprising
hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) and herpangina (mouth blisters), were
reported on Thursday.

By far, collective enterovirus infections were found in 4 local creches and
2 primary schools, while only the Tung Sin Tong II creche, where the first
local HFMD case was recorded, is closed, according to the SSM.

EV71 is one of the commonest types of enterovirus that can cause HFMD,
which usually starts with a slight fever followed by blisters and ulcers in
the mouth and rashes on the hands and feet, according to information posted
on the website of China's Health Ministry. If the disease develops, it can
lead to death.

Meanwhile, 3 cases of enterovirus cases previously confirmed as EV71
infections were excluded from the list after further diagnoses, and none of
the local enterovirus cases was serious so far, according to the statement.

Hundreds of children infected in disease outbreak
-------------------------------------------------
The government has confirmed that over 450 children throughout Mongolia
have been diagnosed as having the potentially deadly hand, foot and mouth
disease (HFMD), in a rampant outbreak of the highly contagious disease. The
disease, confirmed as being in at least 5 provinces as well as the capital
city, is testing the government's emergency capabilities and forcing the
closure of schools and some businesses.

The 1st case of the disease was reported last Thursday [8 May 2008] in
Ulaanbaatar, with numbers increasing dramatically each day. Only 10 of the
21 aimags [provinces] have been able to confirm they do not have any cases
of the disease. While the disease is quite common and can be contained,
authorities are concerned it could lead to deaths like in China, where 42
children have died and nearly 25 000 people have been infected.

As a result, the government has taken precautionary measures that included
quarantining elementary schools for an indefinite period from Monday [12
May 2008], closing some businesses frequented by children and cancelling
several public events. While children are overwhelmingly those infected,
some adults have been diagnosed with HFMD since the start of the week.

As well as Ulaanbaatar, the disease is confirmed in Orkhon Dundgobi,
Mandalgobi, Sukhbaatar, Khentii and Bulgan aimags [provinces]. Hospitals in
several other aimags have reported having patients with symptoms of HFMD,
although the disease has not yet been verified.

The 1st case was reported on Thursday [8 May 2008] in Ulaanbaatar. Since
then the General Authority for Emergency Management (GAEM) has seen a rapid
escalation. Deputy prime minister M Enkhbold is heading an emergency
committee to take measures to prevent the spread of the epidemic, which
yesterday agreed to a proposal for Tugrug 305 million in response aid
[about USD 262 000].

"74 per cent of the affected children are aged 4 years old," Enkhbold said.
"The National Emergency Management Agency held meetings last weekend and
made some decisions and have established some procedures. "In order to
follow these, the Government of Mongolia budgeted Tugrug 57.7 [USD 0.05. Is
this per person or in millions? - Mod.SH] to the training, advertising,
medicine and appropriate cleaning equipment which is useful for prevention
from this disease." The advertising budget the government has allocated
will be on television and radio soon and will educate the public on the
dangers of the disease.

No one has been killed by the disease to date, and at least 29 children
have fully recovered. While hundreds of the suspected patients have been
hospitalized, many others with lighter symptoms have been quarantined at home.

Officials said the 250 beds it had dedicated to HFMD in the National Center
for Studies of Infectious Diseases are full. An overwhelming number of
infected patients will recover from the disease within a few weeks. Some of
the businesses the government deemed as having a high-exposure risk
included small kiosks, some grocery stores, fitness centers and computer
gaming centers. It is generally expected these businesses will not be
compensated for having to close.

Death toll by hand, foot & mouth disease doubles [that of] petechial fever
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Southern Viet Nam has 500 hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) patients
hospitalised. According to the HCM City Pasteur Institute, the region has
recorded 10 deaths by the disease so far this year [2008], nearly 2 times
more than the number claimed by petechial fever.

Dr Luong Chan Quang of the HCM City Pasteur Institute warned that it is
difficult to diagnose HFMD in children because not all patients have
typical symptoms -- water spots on their bodies. Patients who experience
mental complications or encephalitis may suffer after-effects though they
[recover].

Quang said that 7 of the 10 deaths from HFMD in the south were in HCM City.
The doctor said that this epidemic boomed in HCM City for the first time in
2003, returned to the city for the 2nd time in 2006 and broke out again in
late 2007. Most southern provinces don't have supervising systems for this
epidemic. So far this year, only 7 of 20 southern provinces have released
reports on HFMD: Ben Tre with 215 patients, Can To 124, Dong Nai 197, Dong
Thap 322, Kien Giang 261, HCM City 1018 and Vinh Long 220.

The HCM City Pasteur Institute set up a network to supervise the disease
early this year. According to reports from 3 big hospitals in HCM City
Children's Hospitals 1 and 2 and the Tropical Disease Hospital the total
number of HFMD patients in 2007 was 2988, 30 per cent more than in 2006.
The local Department of Health said that 16 died from the disease in 2007
and only 3 in 2006. By 8 May 2008, the city had 755 children with HFMD.

The disease mainly attacks children under 3 years old and it is transmitted
through saliva, mucus, and excrement. Epidemiologists say the disease
develops into an epidemic because of poor environmental hygiene in the
rainy season. The disease is often caused by Coxsackievirus A16 and
Enterovirus 71. The latter can cause serious mental complications and death.

The Asian HFDV outbreak shows no signs of abating, but the overall
mortality remains low, apart from the city of Fuyang in Anhui province of
China. According to the report from Mongolia the number of cases in China
has reached 2500 and the number of fatalities has increased from 36 to 42.
