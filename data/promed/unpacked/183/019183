ANIMAL DISEASE SURVEILLANCE - INDIA

Subject: Re: Animal disease surveillance in India

As regards animal disease surveillance in India, we have an animal
disease surveillance scheme in the Dept. of Animal Husbandry and
Dairying, Union Ministry of Agriculture which reports animal disease
occurence at the National level. You may be aware that in India,
animal disease control is a "State" subject i.e. individual States in
the Federation of States have the responsibility for disease control
and therefore reporting. However, certain aspects are in the
concurrent list of the Indian constitution and hence reporting to
International agencies such as OIE is made by data collected from
the States by the Union Government. Usually monthly reports (published
late by more than 6 months on an average) of the data are made and
circulated to some Central and State Government Officials. The OIE is
sent the same report in the OIE format.
In 1993, an attempt was made to use the National Informatics Centres
District level computer based communication network NICNET to gather
disease reports from District Headquarters. This "Animal Disease
Information System" aims to collect information on OIE List A and B and
also FAO List C diseases. The System is basically a continuation of the
old system in a "computerised" mode but with a slightly modified list
of diseases to be reported. (The older system reported diseases like
Coccidiosis, Amphistomiasis and Fascioliasis at the National level! Not
that they should not be reported but it is an impossible task in country
as large as India). The system is still under implementation.
As you can gather from the above both the systems are "passive" and
very little can be done to use the data in an epidemiologically useful
manner. The major problem is that the system does not tell us the exact
geographic location or the population that was at risk. The primary
objective of the System is to fulfill the mandatory requirement of OIE to
which India is a signatory.
The System is also not supported by laboratory diagnosis and thus the
information provided by it is also not reliable.
You may be aware that India, like many other developing countries, do not
have many trained epidemiologists. In case of veterinary science, they are
totally scarce. Further, veterinarians who are able to use computers
proficiently are also not common. Very few veterinarians have access to
computers and therefore cannot make use of the data collected at a local
level. Thus, the entire data collection system suffers from want of analysis
and improvement.
We also have problems of archaic legislation. What we have as legislation
is what the British enacted in the early part of the century.
I am part of a team that has formulated a new scheme entitled "National
Animal Production and Health Information System". The scheme has been
proposed to the Government of India by the Technology Mission on Dairy
Development. There are several interwoven objectives of the proposed system
but the most important are to improve animal productivity and be a
responsible member of the International community as far as animal disease
is concerned. The scheme includes developing a disease information system,
among other components, within the ambit of a "epidemiological delivery
system" wherein training of manpower, strengthening of the laboratory
diagnostic infrastructure, implementing a new disease control act and
providing field veterinarian access to computer networks is proposed. The
basic thrust is towards an attitudinal change from disease control through
mass campaigns to disease surveillance, control in zones and networking to
share disease information. The approximate budget is Rs. 400 million (US$ 10
million) for the entire scheme.
My personal experience has been that we face strong resistance in the
decision making bodies of the Government. This is primarily because
we do not have persons with an epidemiological background to support
us.
Thus, I feel, developing and implementing disease surveillance
and reporting systems in developing countries is much more than providing
computers and software. We have to have a more complete view of the issues
involved. I feel that International agencies that fund and support Governments
for development do not take cognisance of these issues and therefore their
schemes and projects hardly make a dent. For example, in today's newspapers,
we have headlines that a major international bank is funding the Indian
Government for maternal (human) health. Some days back the bank
representatives went on record that reliable data and information on maternal
and reproductive health in India was not available. The newspapers do not say
how they are going to correct the situation or how schemes were made without
reliable data!
It is for this reason that I feel PROMED should also be a forum to discuss
and draw attention to the problems of health and disease management in a
large part of the World. After all epidemics may arise from anywhere.
