-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Anthrax is a globally important animal disease and zoonosis. Despite this, our current knowledge of anthrax ecology is largely limited to arid ecosystems, where outbreaks are most commonly reported. Here we show that the dynamics of an anthrax-causing agent, _Bacillus cereus biovar anthracis_, in a tropical rainforest have severe consequences for local wildlife communities. Using data and samples collected over 3 decades, we show that rainforest anthrax is a persistent and widespread cause of death for a broad range of mammalian hosts. We predict that this pathogen will accelerate the decline and possibly result in the extirpation of local chimpanzee (_Pan troglodytes verus_) populations. We present the epidemiology of a cryptic pathogen and show that its presence has important implications for conservation.

Bcbva-positive carcasses were broadly distributed throughout the TNP [Tai National Park, in Cote d'Ivoire] research area, without the kind of geographic clustering described for anthrax in savannah ecosystems 12, 22. We determined Bcbva prevalence within and outside the research area using a subset of 908 flies caught systematically according to a grid system within 19 days. We detected Bcbva-positive flies in 16 out of 83 traps. Prevalence was higher in the research area (8 out of 21 traps were Bcbva-positive) than in the surrounding forest belt (8 out of 62 traps were Bcbva-positive) (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.02). Long-term research activity within the TNP research area has had a protective effect on wildlife and led to an increased density of mammals 23, which might explain higher Bcbva activity. Genome data revealed multiple contemporaneous transmission chains caused by co-circulating strains (2-48 SNPs distance, median: 25 SNPs) in different areas of the park over the short time period of the fly snapshot. For low genomic distances (≤35 SNPs), genomic and geographic distances of all TNP isolates were positively correlated (R2 = 0.72), providing further indication of spatially restricted transmission, which might reflect carcass-mediated spread of Bcbva. Because wildlife cases included exclusively arboreal monkeys, we explored the vertical distribution of Bcbva by catching flies simultaneously on the ground and up to 30 m in the canopy. We detected Bcbva in 12 out of 103 canopy flies (11.7 percent) and retrieved isolates from 5 of these. While on the ground carcass-deposition sites are likely to be the source of Bcbva infections, flies may contribute to Bcbva transmission in the upper strata of the rainforest 24.

Fly samples indicated a large proportion of undetected anthrax mortality. During 19 days of focused fly sampling, we retrieved Bcbva isolates from 17 flies, with 13 strains being more than 2 SNPs different from any other strain. Because 2 SNPs appear to be the upper level of within-host diversity, this implies the presence of at least 13 different Bcbva-positive carcasses. Yet, during the same sampling period, only 3 Bcbva-positive carcasses were discovered and their isolates all corresponded to one of the fly Bcbva lineages (≤2 SNPs difference). This suggests carcass monitoring alone underestimates mortality by at least an order of magnitude.

We investigated the consequences of Bcbva-induced mortality on the species best studied in this ecosystem, chimpanzees. Chimpanzees have a low reproduction rate 25 and are thus particularly sensitive towards external changes to their environment. On the basis of demographic data collected from habituated groups in TNP, we simulated population viability at a 150 years horizon across a broad range of demographic models, which included or excluded anthrax-induced mortality. Our simulations showed that, with Bcbva, the TNP chimpanzee population would only have high chances to persist in the case of an overall annual per capita mortality rate owing to other causes of 1 per cent. Such a low mortality rate is, however, not even observed in captive chimpanzees. In wild chimpanzees the lowest annual per capita mortality rate is 4 per cent (in early adults). Under such a survival probability (0.96), the simulated presence of anthrax invariably led to a clearly reduced survival probability of communities. For example, 76 out of 84 models resulted in an extirpation probability that was higher than 50 per cent, whereas the model, which we consider the most realistic (community size 60, maximum age 46 years and inter-birth interval 6 years), resulted in an extirpation probability of 89 per cent. Our simulations therefore suggest that anthrax-induced mortality will result in deterministic population declines and possible extirpation of TNP chimpanzees over the next 150 years. The risk of extirpation will increase if chimpanzee mortality due to hunting and human-borne infectious diseases continues to rise.

To determine whether similar unrecognized effects on wildlife might be occurring elsewhere, we tested 784 flies collected at 8 different sites, as well as 136 bones from 12 sites in 5 and 9 sub-Saharan countries, respectively. All sites had chimpanzee populations but none (nor the country) had previously reported Bcbva cases. We only detected Bcbva genetic material in 2 out of 105 flies and one out of 8 bones collected in the Grebo National Forest in Liberia, about 40 km [24.85 miles]from TNP. The genome sequences of isolates from the 2 fly samples nested within the diversity of Bcbva in TNP, which may indicate an epidemiological link. We did not detect Bcbva in 305 flies from 2 sites where Bcbva cases have previously been reported (Dja Reserve, Cameroon, and Dzanga Sangha Protected Areas, Central African Republic). Although the lack of detection at other sites needs to be interpreted with caution owing to variable fly species composition, these data suggest that Bcbva dynamics may also vary across rainforest ecosystems. It will be important to further uncover the scale and environmental drivers behind Bcbva prevalence. Such knowledge will be critical for mitigating against the detrimental effects of Bcbva on wildlife and for better assessing human infection risk, which for anthrax in rainforest ecosystems has, to date, been considered very low.
