Norovirus outbreak among evacuees contained
-------------------------------------------
Doctors at the complex housing thousands of hurricane Katrina evacuees said
on Friday [9 Sep 2005] that they have contained a viral outbreak that
caused diarrhea and vomiting among hundreds of people. About 700 people
have been treated, with 40 still in isolation to contain the virus, said Dr
Hermenia Palacio, director of Harris County Public Health and Emergency
Services. The evacuees were diagnosed [to be suffering from norovirus
infection], the same easily spread bug that's made many cruise ship
passengers sick. While [the effects of norovirus infection] were relatively
mild, doctors took the precaution of isolating some people to keep it from
running rampant.
An estimated 3000 evacuees are still in the Astrodome using public
restrooms, and cots are lined up in close rows. The sick were quarantined
until they had had no symptoms for 48 hours. Tom Skinner, spokesman for the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, said there have been
reports of similar outbreaks at shelters around the country, but norovirus
does not appear to be a widespread problem. "We're getting reports of
clusters of cases of diarrheal illness," Skinner said. "In these shelters,
it's important for the medical professionals to pay close attention to
hygiene."
Palacio said the norovirus outbreak at the Astrodome and Reliant Center in
Houston peaked on Monday [5 Sep 2005]. "We've been seeing fewer and fewer
cases since then," she said. Such a viral outbreak poses the most serious
threat to the oldest and youngest in the evacuee population, Palacio said.
Many of the Astrodome's residents spent much of last week [1st week
September 2005] in New Orleans' rancid Superdome without working toilets
and little clean water. She said the evacuees here have made at least 7000
clinic visits and that doctors took some simple precautions to help prevent
the spread of the virus. "There's been more washing of hands than I've ever
seen," she said.

Rumors of dysentery and cholera outbreaks unfounded
---------------------------------------------------
In the 1st horrifying days after hurricane Katrina, it was easy to believe
reports that a Biloxi disaster-relief shelter had been hit by dysentery, a
disease rarely seen outside underdeveloped countries. Soon, there were
other presumed outbreaks, plus rumors of cholera, creating the false
impression that Mississippi's Gulf Coast homeless were being warehoused in
Dickensian squalor and disease. There was no dysentery and no cholera,
health officials say. Lab tests showed the outbreak of diarrhea that raised
fears of dysentery was caused by norovirus infection. Norovirus, which
sometimes hits travelers on ships, also is known as "the cruise ship virus".
While conditions were wretched at first, the American Red Cross, public
health agencies, and the homeless themselves have turned 15 sanctioned
shelters in the 6-county region of the Mississippi Gulf Coast into safe
havens. A survey of the shelters and hospitals by federal health officials
found no unexpected illness this week [2nd week September 2005] and
"surprisingly few" cases of gastrointestinal disease, said Mills McNeill,
the chief epidemiologist for the Mississippi Department of Health, even
though most shelters still lack running water and sewerage.
"What we have at this point is a good-news story regarding communicable
disease," McNeill said. "Despite the fact that we're still early in the
recovery, we have had nothing that we feel would overwhelm our health care
system." Which is not to say that all is well. Makeshift refuges and
campsites continue to pop up. Some chronically ill people have opted not to
go to shelters for the medically needy, and many residents still can't get
to shelters or refuse to go.
In the hard-hit Mississippi communities of Bay St. Louis and Waveland,
where the Red Cross hasn't opened any shelters because of flooding
concerns, more than 1000 residents turned a high school into a shelter. It
quickly became overcrowded and filthy, prompting the school superintendent
to order an evacuation that was completed Wednesday [7 Sep 2005]. "It was a
hellhole," said Cordelia Hunnicuff, a Bay St. Louis resident. "The longer
we stayed, the worse conditions got," she said.
