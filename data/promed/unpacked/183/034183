Wasting disease found in 24 more deer
-------------------------------------
The Sustainable Resource Development of Alberta announced Tuesday [17
Jun 2008], 24 more cases of chronic wasting disease (CWD) have been
found in Alberta's wild deer.

The results, from a 2007-08 testing program, bring the province's
count of the disease up to 53 cases.

CWD affects the central nervous system and causes infected animals to
slowly waste away. Evidence suggests it does not affect humans. Darcy
Whiteside, spokesperson for Sustainable Resource and Development,
said the department has consulted with communities such as Provost,
Oyen, and Wainwright, where many of the diseased deer have been detected.

"The next step is really making hunters aware there are opportunities
here," he said, referring to an ongoing hunting program the
government implemented in 2005 when the 1st diseased deer was found
30 kilometers (18.6 mi) southeast of Oyen. The program aims to reduce
deer populations and track the disease. "It's a contagious disease,
so any animal we can take away from the population is a plus," he
said, adding the province was seeing excessive growth in the number
of wild deer even before CWD.

But Whiteside said the new numbers are not huge. "We're still seeing
very low percentages," he said. "There were more deer tested this year."

[If one looks for a disease then it is entirely likely one will be
found. Indeed CWD is a contagious disease but the mechanism is not
completely determined. However, there is mounting evidence that
hunters may be propagating the disease. When an animal is field
dressed and the gut pile is left in the field (hence field dressed)
then other deer come and consume the gut piles. We know that prions
seem to be presented to the central nervous system through the gastro
intestinal tract. So leaving the GI and the associated lymph nodes is
like leaving the disease out. The animal may not appear ill because
the disease has not progressed to the point of being visible.

Some may say that deer are not carnivorous, but indeed, given the
opportunity to eat gut piles, birds, eggs, etc, they clearly avail
themselves of these opportunities. - Mod.TG
