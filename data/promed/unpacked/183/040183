A dead beaver found in the Lily Lake area of Rocky Mountain National Park has tested positive for tularemia, an uncommon but serious infectious disease, Kyle Patterson with RMNP said in a release.

Tularemia is often spread through insects and ticks or by handling infected or dead animals, like rabbits, beavers and other rodents.

The disease can also be spread to humans and can cause serious symptoms like fever, chills, joint pain, muscle aches and chest pain. In early stages, it can be successfully treated with antibiotics.

Tips on preventing infection include using insect repellent, washing hands, and giving wildlife space.

Tularemia was also detected in the Lily Lake area in 2015, Patterson said.

In June [2018], a rabbit found near South Table Mountain Park in Jefferson County died from tularemia. That was the 1st reported animal case of the disease in Colorado this year [2018].

Though tularemia is rare in Colorado, there are about 200 human cases of the disease in the U.S. each year.

A dead marmot in Crater Lake on Teton Pass tested positive for tularemia this week [23-27 Jul 2018], a disease that can be serious and potentially deadly for humans. It's also known as "rabbit fever" or "deer fly fever" and frequently affects rabbits, hares and rodents.

The marmot was found by a U.S. Forest Service employee. Crater Lake will not be closed but warning signs telling people to not let their pets swim in the water, not to drink the water and to wear bug spray will likely be posted.

People can become ill with tularemia after being bitten by ticks, deer flies or horse flies. It can also be transmitted by handling infected animals, or through ingestion or contact with untreated, contaminated water or insufficiently cooked meat.

Dan Forman, the county's emergency veterinarian and chairman of the Teton District Board of Health, called tularemia "unprecedented for our region."

"We're having more tick-borne diseases that we feel will most likely be a growing trend in this area with changes in our climate patterns," Forman said. "We feel this is a trend that will continue."

According to State Public Health Veterinarian Karl Musgrave, there are no reported cases of tularemia in Teton County's humans, at least back to 2015. It's hard to tell how the marmot became infected, he said.

"Tularemia can be in water, we know that," Musgrave said. "It can also be in ticks, it can be in deer flies. So we don't really know how the marmot got it."

In 2017, there were 2 human cases reported, both in Park County, and in 2016, there were 7. 2015 was a busy year, with 21 human cases reported.

"We have tularemia periodically across the state," said Kim Deti, Wyoming Department of Health spokeswoman. "It's never very many cases, but it can be a pretty serious one so it's something to not overlook."

Wyoming was actually the 1st state to document a human getting tularemia from an animal -- from a beaver, near Sheridan, in 1939.

Symptoms of the disease include fever, swollen and painful lymph glands, inflamed eyes, sore throat, mouth sores, skin ulcers and diarrhea. If the bacteria are inhaled, symptoms can include sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, joint pain, dry cough, progressive weakness and pneumonia.

It's recommended you seek medical care if you think you may have been exposed.

[Tularemia is largely confined to the Northern Hemisphere and is not normally found in the tropics or the Southern Hemisphere.
_Francisella tularensis subsp. tularensis_(Type A) is associated with lagomorphs (rabbits and hares) in North America. Wild rodents are also frequently infected, and occurrence of human cases are usually linked to these host species. _F. tularensis_ is transmitted primarily by ticks and biting flies, and is highly virulent for humans and domestic rabbits.

In addition to vector transmission, tularemia may be spread contact with infected animals or environmental fomites, by inhalation, or by ingestion of the poorly cooked flesh of infected animals or contaminated water. - Mod.PMB
