--------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Houston, Texas, maintains an environment conducive to dengue virus (DENV) emergence; however, surveillance is passive and diagnostic testing is not readily available. To determine if DENV is present in the area, we tested 3768 clinical specimens (2138 cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] and 1630 serum) collected from patients with suspected mosquito-borne viral disease between 2003 and 2005. We identified 47 immunoglobulin M (IgM)-positive dengue cases, including 2 cases that were positive for viral RNA in serum for dengue serotype 2. The majority of cases did not report any history of travel outside the Houston area prior to symptom onset. The epidemic curve suggests an outbreak occurred in 2003 with continued low-level transmission in 2004 and 2005. Chart abstractions were completed for 42 of the 47 cases; 57 per cent were diagnosed with meningitis and/or encephalitis, and 43 per cent met the case definition for dengue fever. 2 of the 47 cases were fatal, including one with illness compatible with dengue shock syndrome. Our results support local transmission of DENV during the study period. These findings heighten the need for dengue surveillance in the southern United States.

[This is another example of seek and ye shall find. With appropriate conditions to permit ongoing dengue transmission -- adequate vectors and ample susceptible hosts -- only a viremic individual was needed to initiate an outbreak. Apparently, dengue virus infection was not considered as a possible cause of the disease that was being seen. Although the outbreak is long over, one hopes that the lesson of the need for awareness of risk of infection will linger.
