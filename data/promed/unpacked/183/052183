The Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) confirmed a raccoon entered the Lexington Medical Center in West Columbia, South Carolina. The raccoon tested positive for rabies. One person was exposed and has been referred to their healthcare provider. The raccoon was submitted to DHEC's laboratory for testing on 18 Dec [2020] and was confirmed to have rabies on 19 Dec [2020].

"To reduce the risk of getting rabies, always give wild and stray animals plenty of space," said Terri McCollister, Rabies Program team leader. "If you see an animal in need, avoid touching it, and contact someone trained in handling animals, such as your local animal control officer or wildlife rehabilitator."

If you believe you or someone you know has had contact with or been potentially exposed to this or another suspect animal, please reach out to your local Environmental Affairs office. An exposure is defined as direct contact (such as through broken skin or mucous membranes in the eyes, nose, or mouth) with saliva or brain/nervous system tissue from an infected animal.

It's important to keep pets up to date on their rabies vaccination, which is one of the easiest and most effective ways to protect against the disease. If your pet is found with wounds of unknown origin, please consider that your pet could have been exposed to rabies and contact the Columbia office [of the DHEC] during normal business hours. To report a bite or exposure on holidays or times outside of normal business hours, please call the DHEC after-hours service number.

This raccoon is the 14th animal in Lexington County to test positive for rabies in 2020. There have been 167 cases of rabid animals statewide this year [2020]. Since 2011, South Carolina averages about 130 positive cases a year. In 2019, 17 of the 148 confirmed rabies cases in South Carolina were in Lexington County.

Contact information for local Environmental Affairs Offices is available at <www.scdhec.gov/EAoffices>. For more information on rabies, visit <www.scdhec.gov/rabies> or <www.cdc.gov/rabies>.

Alamance County reported its 3rd case of rabies on 23 Dec [2020]. Animal control was notified of a dog bite involving 3 people near Hester Road in Burlington, officials said. Once animal control picked the dog up, it was euthanized for humane reasons and later tested positive for rabies. Four other dogs were involved in the incident that animal control responded to. Two of the dogs were up to date on their vaccinations.

Those 2 dogs received vaccination boosters and are under a 45-day quarantine, according to Alamance County officials. [This article does not tell us what happened to the other 2 dogs involved in the incident. Presumably they were not vaccinated and would have likely been euthanized or are on a much longer quarantine. Or perhaps the officers are looking for the other 2 dogs involved in the incident. - Mod.TG]

If you live in the area of Hester Road in Burlington and have pets, the health department is urging you to examine your pet for any wounds or signs they have come in contact with the infected dog. If you believe your pet has come in contact with this dog, notify Alamance County Animal Control.

Last year [2019], the county saw 7 animal cases of rabies.

https://www.westchestergov.com/home/all-press-releases/8745-rabies-alert-rabid-black-stray-kitten-captured-in-new-rochelle


The Westchester County Department of Health is alerting residents a black stray kitten was caught on Mount Joy Place between Chauncey Avenue and Coligni Avenue in New Rochelle on 8 Dec [2020] was confirmed to be rabid today [Wed 23 Dec 2020]. The kitten bit an employee at the New Rochelle Humane Society on 10 Dec [2020]. It was brought to the shelter by a resident who had been caring for the sick kitten. The employee is being treated for rabies exposure, and the resident is being evaluated for rabies exposure.

Anyone who believes they, their children, or their pet may have had contact with this kitten between 2 and 8 Dec 2020 is encouraged to call the Westchester County Department of Health to assess the need for lifesaving rabies treatment. When administered early enough, before symptoms develop, the treatment is fully effective. Once symptoms occur, the disease is fatal.

The health department used robocalls today to notify nearby residents. "Stay alert and closely supervise children and pets when outside," said health commissioner Sherlita Amler. "To protect yourself and your pets, make sure your pets' rabies vaccines are up to date."

Unusual behavior may be the 1st sign of rabies in an animal. A rabid animal may become either abnormally aggressive or unusually tame. It may lose fear of people and become excited and irritable, or, conversely, appear particularly passive and lethargic. Staggering and frothing at the mouth are sometimes noted.

Residents who see a stray or wild animal acting strangely should avoid contact with the animal and alert local authorities to avoid possible exposure to rabies. Residents are also advised to keep their trash can lids securely sealed and avoid leaving pet food outdoors. Any physical contact with a wild or unfamiliar animal should be reported to a health-care provider. All animal bites or contacts with animals suspected of having rabies must be reported to the Westchester County Department of Health 24 hours a day.

Keeping pet rabies vaccinations up to date is also important for protection against rabies. New York State law requires dogs, cats, and ferrets to be vaccinated against rabies and receive regular booster shots. For more information, go to <www.westchestergov.com/health> or call the Rabies Infoline.

A cat being fostered by a family in Richland Township has tested positive for the rabies virus, according to the Allegheny County Health Department. The cat, which was living with a family along Beechnut Drive, was brought into the lab for testing after it began scratching and biting, county health officials said. All of the foster family members are seeking treatment for possible exposure to the virus.

The cat is the 20th animal in Allegheny County that has tested positive for rabies this year [2020]. There have been 8 bats, 7 raccoons, 4 cats, and a groundhog.

Rabies is a viral infection affecting the nervous system of animals and people. It is almost always fatal if untreated. Rabies is frequently seen in raccoons and can spread quickly to pets by a bite or scratch, which puts human beings at greater risk for exposure.

For the past 20 years, the health department has distributed bait containing a rabies vaccine to inoculate wild raccoons against the virus. This year [2020] the bait was put out between 31 Jul and 10 Aug [2020] by employees and volunteers with the county health department and the United States Department of Agriculture's National Rabies Management Program. A raccoon is vaccinated by eating a bait containing the vaccine. The raccoon develops antibodies within 2-3 weeks that can protect it if it is exposed to another infected raccoon.

Several of the rabid animals tested by the health department this year [2020] were from the North Hills. A stray cat found in Ross tested positive in June [2020], and a rabid raccoon was discovered in McCandless in May [2020].

Anyone who is bitten, scratched, or exposed to an animal's saliva should cleanse the area with soap and water, seek emergency medical treatment, and call the health department at 412-687-2243 to report the incident.

["Rabies is a fatal but preventable viral disease. It can spread to people and pets if they are bitten or scratched by a rabid animal. In the United States, rabies is mostly found in wild animals like bats, raccoons, skunks, and foxes. However, in many other countries dogs still carry rabies, and most rabies deaths in people around the world are caused by dog bites.

The rabies virus infects the central nervous system. If a person does not receive the appropriate medical care after a potential rabies exposure, the virus can cause disease in the brain, ultimately resulting in death. Rabies can be prevented by vaccinating pets, staying away from wildlife, and seeking medical care after potential exposures before symptoms start." https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/index.html

If you have been a bite victim of an animal that could have rabies, you should consult your physician right away. You may need wound care but also advice on post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). If you have had a bite or scratch from an animal that has tested positive for rabies, work with your physician for PEP.

"In the United States, PEP consists of a regimen of one dose of immune globulin and 4 doses of rabies vaccine over a 14-day period. Rabies immune globulin and the 1st dose of rabies vaccine should be given by your health-care provider as soon as possible after exposure. Current vaccines are relatively painless and are given in your arm like a flu or tetanus vaccine; rabies vaccines are not given in the stomach." https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/exposure/index.html

"Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) consists of a dose of human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) and rabies vaccine given on the day of the rabies exposure, and then a dose of vaccine given again on days 3, 7, and 14. For people who have never been vaccinated against rabies previously, PEP should always include administration of both HRIG and rabies vaccine. The combination of HRIG and vaccine is recommended for both bite and non-bite exposures, regardless of the interval between exposure and initiation of treatment.

"People who have been previously vaccinated or are receiving preexposure vaccination for rabies should receive only vaccine.

"Adverse reactions to rabies vaccine and immune globulin are not common. Newer vaccines in use today cause fewer adverse reactions than previously available vaccines. Mild, local reactions to the rabies vaccine, such as pain, redness, swelling, or itching at the injection site, have been reported. Rarely, symptoms such as headache, nausea, abdominal pain, muscle aches, and dizziness have been reported. Local pain and low-grade fever may follow injection of rabies immune globulin.

"The vaccine should be given at recommended intervals for best results. Talk to your doctor or state or local public health officials if you will not be able to have your shots at the recommended interval. Rabies prevention is a serious matter, and changes should not be made in the schedule of doses. Patient assistance programs that provide medications to uninsured or underinsured patients are available for rabies vaccine and immune globulin.

"People cannot transmit rabies to other people unless they themselves are sick with rabies. PEP will protect you from developing rabies, and therefore you cannot expose other people to rabies. You can continue to participate in your normal activities." https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/medical_care/index.html

Rabies vaccination for your pets protects your pet and can also help protect yourself. Your veterinarian should be consulted regarding the health of your animal and provides rabies vaccines for your pet, whether it is a horse, cow, dog, cat, sheep, pig, or other animal. Rabies is a deadly disease for unvaccinated animals and for people without proper care.

Sadly, strays, and even baby animals, can be infected before we know they have the disease. Bats are notorious for carrying and transmitting rabies. The bite of a bat may be very small and may be almost painless, but it can transmit the rabies virus. So a puppy or kitten may be incubating the disease when found/fostered/adopted. Please visit a veterinarian when you first find/adopt/receive a pet. - Mod.TG]
