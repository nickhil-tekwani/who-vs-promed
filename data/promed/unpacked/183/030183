Hepatitis A: south east [SE] Michigan outbreak
----------------------------------------------
Since the beginning of the outbreak in Aug 2016, public health response has included increased healthcare awareness efforts, public notification and education, and outreach with vaccination clinics for high-risk populations. No common sources of food, beverages, or drugs have been identified as a potential source of infection. Transmission appears to be through direct person-to-person spread and illicit drug use. Those with history of injecting and non-injecting drug use, homelessness or transient housing, and incarceration are thought to be at greater risk in this outbreak setting. Notably, this outbreak has had a high hospitalization rate.

While so much attention has been on the hepatitis A outbreaks in California and Michigan, for good reason, not much attention has been given to the 3rd largest outbreak in the USA -- Utah.

California, particularly the San Diego area and south east Michigan, including Detroit have accounted for more than 1100 cases, 800 hospitalizations and 40 deaths. Out west in the Beehive State, since [1 Jan 2017], Utah public health has identified 84 confirmed cases of hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection (75 outbreak-associated cases); many among persons who are homeless and/or using illicit drugs. About three-quarters of the cases have been reported in Salt Lake County and more than half required hospitalization.

"Our greatest concern with the outbreak is that it will leap into another population, or into the general population, and the outbreak will grow exponentially," said Nicholas Rupp, a spokesman for the Salt Lake County Health Department.

The high rate of hospitalization may be a result of cases having underlying illnesses (for example, alcoholism), or a higher rate of hepatitis comorbidities (for example, hepatitis B or C). No deaths have been reported in Utah. Several cases have been linked by investigation and/or viral sequencing to a national outbreak of hepatitis A involving cases in California and Arizona.

For the current outbreaks among people who are homeless and/or people who use injection and non-injection drugs, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] have encouraged state and local health departments to:
- work with community partners to provide hepatitis A vaccine to people who are homeless, people who use injection and non-injection drugs, and others with established risk factors who are not yet immunized;
- consider hepatitis A vaccination for anyone with ongoing, close contact with people who are homeless or people who use injection and non-injection drugs.

CDC has provided interim outbreak-specific guidance on hepatitis A vaccine administration.
- post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is recommended for unvaccinated people who have been exposed to hepatitis A virus (HAV) in the last 2 weeks; those with evidence of previous vaccination do not require PEP.

PEP consists of:
- hepatitis A vaccine for people aged 1-40 years
- hepatitis A virus-specific immunoglobulin (IG) for people outside of this age range. If immunoglobulin is not available, hepatitis A vaccine can be substituted.

The battle against hepatitis A outbreaks across the USA is being stymied by a national shortage of the vaccine needed to combat it. "Current supply is not sufficient to support demand for vaccine," CDC told CNN in a written statement.

South east Michigan has seen 495 cases of hepatitis A and 19 deaths [now 509 and 20 - Mod.LL], mostly in Macomb and Wayne counties and in Detroit. The outbreak began in August of 2016, and after a drop off during the winter, has been climbing since February of this year [2017], said Michigan Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Angela Minicuci. "We have a limited supply of vaccine," said Minicuci, "so we are prioritizing delivery to high-risk populations."

In California an outbreak of the virus has sickened at least 644 people and claimed 21 lives, mostly in the cities of San Diego, Santa Cruz, and Los Angeles, according to CDC. Persons infected with the virus there have also spread it to Arizona, Utah, and Colorado, said Dr Wilma Wooten, public health director at San Diego's Health and Human Services Agency.

To manage the current shortage, CDC said, staff have been working closely with public health officials to target vaccinations toward at-risk populations, as well as coordinating with vaccine manufacturers "to monitor and manage public and private vaccine orders to make the best use of supplies... during this period of unexpected increased demand."

"It's unprecedented what we are seeing out of California and other parts of the country," said GlaxoSmithKline spokesperson Robin Gaitens. "The shortage is simply an issue of supply and demand." Outbreaks of hepatitis A are normally small, because the vast majority of the US population is inoculated as children at about one year of age. GlaxoSmithKline and Merck are the only companies approved by the Food and Drug Administration to sell a Hepatitis A adult or pediatric vaccine in the US. "We typically provide 1.2 million adult doses each year to the USA market, and the demand this year [2017] has vastly surpassed the supply on hand," Gaitens said. She stressed there is no shortage of the pediatric version, which is given in a 2-dose series about 6 months apart. Nor is there a shortage of their combination hepatitis A/B vaccine.

The current outbreaks of hepatitis A [are associated with] virus genotype (IB), which is normally not found in the USA; it's commoner in the Mediterranean, Turkey and South Africa. However, the current vaccine is effective against all strains of the virus.

In an emailed statement, Merck said it has been taking steps to increase the manufacturing capacity of both their adult and pediatric versions of their vaccine due to "unexpected demand in markets. At the end of October, we began shipping single-dose vials (in packages of 10 vials) for adults, which previously had been on backorder," the statement said. "We anticipate the availability of adult and pediatric pre-filled syringes of the vaccine in the first quarter of 2018."

GlaxoSmithKline also began shipping backordered single-dose syringes at the end of October 2017, Gaitens said, adding that the company is working closely with CDC and California officials on "how to distribute and to ensure the vaccines are actually going to where there is the greatest need."

[Given the size of these outbreaks, as well as outbreaks in other countries, it is not surprising that shortages have occurred. In Europe, many of the outbreaks have occurred in MSMs. - Mod.LL
