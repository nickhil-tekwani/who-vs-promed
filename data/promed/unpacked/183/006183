[According to the media, see http://www.reuters.com/article/us-southkorea-footandmouth-idUSKBN15O08P:

"South Korea raised the country's Foot & mouth disease alerts status to the highest level as a 2nd strain of the disease was confirmed 3 days after a 1st outbreak was reported," Seoul's agriculture ministry said [Thu 9 Feb 2017].

The A-type strain of the disease was discovered at a dairy farm in Yeoncheon, less than 50 miles north of the capital, said Kim Kyeong-kyu, deputy minister for food industry policy. Reacting shortly after an outbreak of the O-type strain was confirmed in southeast Korea, the ministry raised the alert status one notch to the maximum.

Since the 1st outbreak was discovered on [Mon 6 Feb 2017], Korea has taken emergency measures including a nationwide vaccination and a movement control order designed to contain the spread of the virus.

The ministry had re-vaccinated all cattle in the country against the O-type virus, and the country's livestock would need to be inoculated again against the A-type strain, Kim said.

Oh Soon-min, a senior agriculture ministry official in charge of animal health, said the ministry was seeking to import more vaccine stocks from manufacturers such as Merial as Korea's inventory of "O+A type" vaccines - which allow livestock to be vaccinated for both strains at the same time - was in short supply.

"We first have to check the company's inventory and we are thinking to bring in as many (supplies) as we can," he added.

Korea regularly inoculates its cattle and hogs against 3 types of foot-and-mouth diseases. It has around 3.14 million cattle and 10 million hogs nationwide.

The agriculture ministry is weighing whether or not to vaccinate hogs again, as cases of infection have so far only been found among cattle, said Park Bong-kyun, commissioner of the Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency".

The following comment by Mod.AS, published recently in posting 20170207.4821122, is applicable here: "Korea's bitter FMD experience in 2010, when a huge number of animals had to be culled, led to practical conclusions; the government decided to undertake extensive measures to prevent a repetition of such event, including enhanced surveillance, improved diagnostic facilities, and general, mass vaccinations. The availability of a potent, tested vaccine is not sufficient; if the vaccination is compulsory, intensified involvement of the State in its implementation is prescribed". - Mod.CRD
