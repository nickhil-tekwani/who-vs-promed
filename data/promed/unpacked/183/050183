NAGOYA--A health alert was issued at the weekend after quarantine officials
said frozen imported chicken already on the market is infected with a
potentially fatal bacteria called VRE.
It is the first time the bacteria has been detected in poultry after it has
cleared customs. The chickens were imported from Vietnam for yakitori.
VRE, or Vancomycin Resistant Enterococcus, is immune to antibiotics. It can
be fatal for elderly people and strike those who already are seriously ill
or have just finished doing strenuous exercise. Ingestion can cause
inflammation and blood poisoning. Healthy people generally need not worry.
The Ministry of Health and Welfare said the bacteria was also discovered in
imported chickens from France and Thailand by quarantine inspectors at the
Yokohama and Kobe customs offices in July. Ministry officials said a
60-year-old man infected with VRE died at a hospital in Kyushu in July.
The batch from Vietnam escaped detection, health officials in Nagoya said.
A number of people have died in hospitals in the United States and Europe
after being
infected with VRE.
The Nagoya wholesaler that shipped the poultry from Vietnam decided to
inspect its stock after learning that VRE had been detected in shipments in
Yokohama and Kobe. Samples of frozen chicken taken to a Nagoya health
laboratory turned up VRE.
The bacteria can be killed by cooking poultry for five minutes at 80-degree
heat.
VRE is believed to result from antibiotics used in poultry farms in Europe and
Southeast Asia, experts said.
