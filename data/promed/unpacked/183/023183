Does bovine besnoitiosis occur in Germany more frequently than previously assumed?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The 1st outbreak of bovine besnoitiosis in Germany was diagnosed in 2008. Since then, there has been no evidence of new infections with _Besnoitia besnoiti_ for several years. Recently, Friedrich Loeffler Institut [FLI] has confirmed chronic bovine besnoitiosis in valuable breeding beef cattle and acute cases have been reported this year [2015].

Investigations by FLI scientists are underway to find out whether the cases are secondary to the "1st" case in 2008 or whether they have been introduced through cattle imported from countries with endemic besnoitiosis.

No detailed information about the location and the number of affected herds or animals is currently available.

Since bovine besnoitiosis continues its spread in European continues (http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/scdocs/doc/1499.pdf), it is feared that the infection in Germany has already been established and may be more common than previously accepted.

[Additional details on the recent spread of besnoitiosis in Europe are available in the commentary to the recent ProMED-mail post archive no. 20150722.3529378. It has been suggested that bovine besnoitiosis should be considered an emerging disease in the EU; see paper at http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/scdocs/doc/1499.pdf, which was reviewed in posting 20100215.0530.

Further information on the situation in Germany and other countries in west and north Europe, particularly in grazing herds of beef breeds, is requested and would be much appreciated.

Bovine besnoitiosis is not included in OIE's list of notifiable diseases. - Mod.AS]

[From the Merck Manual: Besnoitiosis (originally named globidiosis) is a cyst-forming, usually nonfatal disease caused by a number of different species of the apicomplexan protozoa Besnoitia. Lesions are commonly seen in the dermis and in mucous and serous membranes, as well as in other tissues. - Mod.LM
