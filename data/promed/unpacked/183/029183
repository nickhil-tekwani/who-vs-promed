There are now 49 confirmed cases of Zika virus [infection] in the Cook Islands, and as many as 630 people are believed to have suffered from the mosquito-borne disease.

Last month [February 2014], health authorities 1st thought they were dealing with dengue fever, but the 1st batch of test results confirmed 18 cases of Zika [virus infection].

The Director of Community Health Services, Dr Rangi Fariu, says further results from French Polynesia, where the disease 1st broke out in the region, take the number to 49.

He says scientists there are still determining the exact nature of the strain. "Tahiti just asked for those who were already shown positive; they wanted more samples to find out if the Zika [virus] strain that we have here is similar to the one that they have in Tahiti."

Dr Rangi Fariu says doctors have reported about 630 cases of suspected Zika virus [infection] in the Cook Islands and says the real number would be much higher.

[This is the 1st report of Zika virus infections in the Cook Islands. The virus has been circulating in the islands of French Polynesia, New Caledonia and Easter Island. Although the distances between these islands is significant, the virus is being moved by viremic people who travel between them. One can expect further spread to localities where there are populations of vector mosquitoes that can initiate new outbreaks. Zika virus is a flavivirus. Symptoms of Zika fever may include fever, headache, red eyes, rash, muscle aches, and joint pains. The illness is usually mild and lasts 4-7 days. No fatalities caused by Zika virus infection have been reported.

For Zika virus [infection cases] in French Polynesia, the number of suspected cases would be 8600 since the beginning of October 2013, according to the latest WHO regional newsletter, published earlier this week.

In New Caledonia, where the 1st locally acquired case of Zika [virus infection] was reported in mid-January 2014, the number of confirmed cases as of 18 Mar 2014 was 276, accumulated since the end of November 2013.

[In French Polynesia as of 15 Mar 2014, it was estimated that more than 30 000 cases sought medical care with Zika-like symptoms there since the outbreak began in October 2013, with 8503 confirmed cases of Zika virus infection (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20140316.2335754). It appears that the numbers of cases of Zika virus infection in French Polynesia are increasing somewhat. Some of the 30 000 cases mentioned above may have been caused by other pathogens, such as dengue viruses, that were also being transmitted during the same time period.

There were 49 confirmed cases of Zika virus infection (30 imported from French Polynesia) as of 9 Feb 2014 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20140210.2268533). That number has increased to the 276 cases reported above, although it is not stated how many were locally acquired.
