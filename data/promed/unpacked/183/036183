In early August 1999 a case of hepatitis A was identified in a resident of a
permanent caravan site near Guildford, Surrey, UK. The patient had become
unwell during the last few days of July, following a period of travelling in
Kent and Essex. No prophylaxis was given at that stage.
This week the following further cases of hepatitis A have been identified:
- a sibling of the index case;
- another resident of the caravan site;
- another individual (not a caravan-dweller) who lives near the site; and
- a cousin of the index case who had been in contact with the index family,
but who lives on a different caravan site 5-10 miles away.
Close contacts of the index have recently moved to the Midlands, and there
are also siblings in Cornwall.
Following discussion with the regional epidemiologist, it was agreed to
offer hepatitis A vaccination to all the residents of the two caravan parks,
to reduce the risk of transmission and further cases.
At present no further information is available to us on the names and
whereabouts of contacts outside West Surrey.
