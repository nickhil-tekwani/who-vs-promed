On the cruise ship Diamond Princess, on which an outbreak of the new coronavirus has been confirmed, 3 new cases have been confirmed. Since the cruise ship anchored off the port of Yokohama, 64 passengers and crew members have been infected.

The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has conducted a quarantine of about 3700 passengers and all crew members on the Diamond Princess this month [February 2020], including those with symptoms such as fever and cough. We have collected samples from a total of 279 people who have been in close contact with each other and have performed virus tests.

On [8 Feb 2020], 6 new results were completed, and 3 infections were confirmed. The 3 newly confirmed infections have been transported to medical institutions and hospitalized.

The cruise ship left Yokohama last month [January 2020], after which an 80 year old man living in Hong Kong was found infected with the new coronavirus after leaving the ship in Hong Kong.

The total number of confirmed cruise ship passengers infected, excluding the man from Hong Kong, is 64. Also, according to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, 1 of those infected by [6 Feb 2020] had some form of chronic illness and has severe symptoms.

The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has requested that the remaining 3600 passengers and crew members remain on board, and in principle, wait 14 days from [5 Feb 2020] in their cabin.

The number of people infected with the new coronavirus in Japan is 89, including 64 on the cruise ship.

C. Cruise ship quarantine
Date: Fri 7 Feb 2020 11:49 PM ET

People who are quarantined aboard the Diamond Princess in Japan have been wondering how long their isolation will last. On [Fri 7 Feb 2020], a health official gave an answer they might not like: the quarantine will be extended every time a new case of the Wuhan coronavirus is confirmed on the ship.

The coronavirus quarantine that has kept some 3700 people aboard the cruise ship is currently set to expire on [19 Feb 2020] -- but that date would be reset if any new samples from people on the ship test positive for the virus, Dr Michael Ryan, executive director of WHO's Health Emergencies Program, said on [Fri 7 Feb 2020].

An additional 41 cases were confirmed early [Fri 7 Feb 2020], bringing the total among passengers and crew to 61. Those samples were part of the initial screening -- meaning those confirmations don't require a new 14-day quarantine to begin. Then on [Sat 8 Feb 2020], officials announced they had confirmed 3 more cases, making a total of 64.

Princess Cruises had announced that the previous group would end their quarantine on [19 Feb 2020]. Among those people, Japan's health ministry had taken samples from just 273 individuals who were deemed to be in an at-risk group, based on their recent travels.

Before the latest announcement, some of the passengers spoke with NPR. "I've been very relaxed," [a passenger from] Florida said of the quarantine's early days, in an phone interview with NPR's Rebecca Davis. But he added that he's now starting to get nervous: "If more and more and more people are getting sick on this ship, what are we doing here? This is crazy."

If the cruise ship were a country, it could already claim the 2nd-highest number of coronavirus cases outside of mainland China. Now passengers are hoping no new cases emerge. "It is difficult for people who get caught up in that situation, because they are confined," WHO's Ryan said at a [Fri 7 Feb 2020] news conference. While the quarantined passengers' physical health is at risk, he said their mental health should also be supported. "It's quite scary -- very, very scary -- to be in that situation," Ryan said.

WHO has been working with Japanese officials to devise a way to organize the passengers into cohorts, Ryan said. The idea is in smaller groups, fewer people would be affected when a new patient is identified. "Because at the moment, every time there's a new case, the quarantine extends 14 days" for everyone on the ship, Ryan said. "So we need to find a way to break that vicious cycle" and get people off the ship as quickly as possible after they're cleared by health screenings. But he cautioned, "There's a lot to work out."

The WHO position adds new clarity to circumstances aboard the cruise ship, which is docked at Japan's Yokohama port. On the ship, passengers -- including some who had already spent 2 weeks aboard the vessel before the quarantine doubled their stay -- are told not to leave their rooms. They visit the deck in shifts, for a rare breath of fresh air.

"My concerns are what happens next," a passenger from Australia, told NPR's Rebecca Davis via text message. "We don't have a clear plan of what is going to happen," she added, citing the risk of new cases. [This passenger], who has been posting messages to social media about her experience on the cruise ship, was on a trip along with her husband, daughter, and 1 of her 2 sons when their vacation was unexpectedly extended by the quarantine. Despite her worries about how long her family will have to wait before they can leave the ship and resume their normal lives in Melbourne, [she] said she doesn't have any complaints about the way they're being treated during the quarantine. "I'm not worried about our quarantine on board," she wrote, adding that with care of the crew, "we are in good hands here." Still, [she] and other passengers hinted at some frustration about the lingering chance that the quarantine could be extended.

At least 10 Americans are among the people who have tested positive for the coronavirus, which is now blamed for more than 722 deaths in mainland China. The patients have been taken to local hospitals. Most of them are from Japan, but some are from Canada, Australia, and other countries.

To detect any new cases aboard the ship, the crew has distributed thermometers to passengers so they can monitor themselves. To ease the strain of prolonged isolation, Princess Cruises says it has been providing complimentary Internet and phone service, to let passengers stay in touch with loved ones. It has also expanded its TV and movie options -- and it says the ship's activities staff is bringing games, puzzles, and other distractions to passengers' rooms.

[This passenger] and her family were able to get some fresh air on Friday afternoon [7 Feb 2020], after spending all of [Wed 5 Feb and Thu 6 Feb 2020] in their room. Because they're in an inner room, she said, they got to visit the outdoors before their fellow passengers whose outer rooms have windows looking out onto the sea. "This is the 1st time we have been out since quarantine started on Tuesday night [5 Feb 2020]," she said. [Her] family joined about 50 other people -- all of them passengers in odd-numbered rooms in the inner tier on her floor "It was kinda strange being outside," she said. And definitely was great enjoying the fresh air. Being inside without windows, you lose track of time."

Passengers are asked to follow several rules when they visit the deck, [She] said. "We were asked to wear masks and gloves, not to come closer than 1m (about 3 feet) to anyone else. To wash our hands with soap and water when we return to our room." Each group gets 90 minutes outside, and there's a 30-minute gap between them. The last passengers come in at 7:30 pm, she said. Because of the large number of people and the need for them to visit the deck in shifts, some of her fellow passengers still hadn't visited the outdoors by late [Fri 7 Feb 2020], she said. As for how her family is coping with being confined to a windowless room for days on end, [she] said they're "pretty close" and can share space. Plus, she said, "My kids are happy to just put on headphones to zone us out lol."

D. UAE confirms 2 new cases
Date: Sat 8 Feb 2020 07.00 GST
Source: Khaleej Times [edited]
https://www.khaleejtimes.com/news/uae-health/coronavirus-uae-reports-2-new-cases


The UAE Ministry of Health and Prevention has announced 2 new cases of the novel coronavirus infection, taking the total number of cases to 7.

The infected patients -- a Filipino and a Chinese -- are said to be in a stable state. A 4-member Chinese family and another Chinese national -- all 5 from the city of Wuhan where the virus originated -- were the previous confirmed cases in the UAE.

The ministry stressed the effectiveness of a predictive electronic system to identify patients at high risk of contracting the novel coronavirus it launched last week. An early warning system (Wareed system) was activated across all its healthcare facilities to quickly identify individuals at higher risk of acquiring coronavirus infection. The early warning system coordinates and manages a potential outbreak. Once automated, algorithms identify a patient as high risk, the Wareed system places consecutive orders for the patient to be isolated and treated immediately. The Ministry said the move was taken in cooperation with the UAE's health authorities as a precautionary measure to protect the country against coronavirus.

https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/international/866641-update-1-thailand-reports-7-new-coronavirus-cases---health-ministry


Thailand's public health ministry reported 7 new cases of the coronavirus on [Sat 8 Feb 2020], including 3 Thais and 4 Chinese. The new cases brought the total reported in the country to 32, among the world's highest number of infections outside of China. "The 7 new cases are all in hospital," said Suwannachai Wattanayingcharoenchai, director-general of the Disease Control Department.

One of the Thai cases was part of the group of 138 evacuated from China's coronavirus epicentre of Wuhan on [Tue 5 Feb 2020], Suwannachai told reporters. The other 2 Thais had exposure to tourists, he said. Among the 4 Chinese, 3 are members of the families of previously reported cases, while the other is a tourist from a "risky area" in China, said Suwannachai. Among the 32 cases Thailand has reported so far, 23 are Chinese while 9 are Thais.

As of Saturday [8 Feb 2020], 1 more patient was allowed to go home, bringing the count of discharges to 10, said Suwannachai. 22 other patients remain in hospital, he said.

https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200207-sitrep-18-ncov.pdf?sfvrsn=fa644293_2


* The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10 AM Central European Time
Highlights
----------
- No new countries reported cases of 2019-nCoV in the past 24 hours.

- To date, a total of 72 states parties [states that are party to the International Health Regulations of WHO] were identified to be implementing travel restrictions through official reports, official statements and the media. Of these 72 States Parties, WHO received 23 (32%) official reports from states parties about their travel restrictions.

- "The Pandemic Supply Chain Network (PSCN)" has commissioned a market assessment of the personal protective equipment market which will be distributed shortly to stakeholders of the PSCN as it continues to monitor the market. In addition, senior management of WHO spoke with the stakeholders of the PSCN to ensure the private sector's continued engagement to distribute supplies to those countries in most need. The PSCN will encourage manufacturers to increase production, commit supplies to frontline health emergency responders, and expand the number of stakeholders who are involved in the PSCN to gain a critical mass of suppliers to mitigate the operational risks within the market. WHO will continue to provide the technical guidance and coordination of supplies to those countries in most need.

Technical focus: monitoring travel restrictions
-----------------------------------------------
Since yesterday [6 Feb 2020], 10 additional states parties are implementing travel restrictions, according to the media and/or official reports to WHO. To date, a total of 72 states parties were identified to be implementing travel restrictions through official reports, official statements and the media. Of these 72 states parties, WHO received 23 (32%) official reports from states parties about their travel restrictions. 6 other states parties published official statements but have not yet formally communicated with WHO on their measures. Of note, the situation is subject to change, and some countries are currently in the process of implementing additional restrictions.

WHO's strategic objectives for this response are to:
- limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and healthcare workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further international spread from China*;
- identify, isolate, and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;
- identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;
- address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;
- communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;
- minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.

*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in healthcare settings, implementation of health measures for travellers, awareness- raising in the population and risk communication.

Preparedness and response
-------------------------
- WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The guidance can be found on the IATA webpage (https://www.iata.org/en/programs/safety/health/diseases/#tab-2).

- WHO has developed a protocol for the investigation of early cases (the "First Few X (FFX) Cases and contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection" https://www.who.int/publications-detail/the-first-few-x-(ffx)-cases-and-contact-investigation-protocol-for-2019-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-infection). The protocol is designed to gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the 1st cases of 2019- nCoV infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health guidance to manage cases and reduce potential spread and impact of infection.

- WHO has been in regular and direct contact with member states where cases have been reported. WHO is also informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.

- WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management, infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and global surveillance for human infection with novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

- WHO has prepared disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment, medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.

- WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.

- WHO has published updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV.

- WHO has activated the R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.

- WHO has developed an online course to provide general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including novel coronaviruses.

- WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an outbreak of a new virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of 2019-nCoV, help understand spread
(https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations).

[5] Subscriber comments re: cruise ship outbreak

The occurrence of 61 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) "infected" individuals on a cruise ship quarantined in Japan provides an unique opportunity to study, in a readily "available" population, in details the characteristics of the epidemiology of the novel coronavirus -- including mode(s) of transmission, transmissibility, clinical severity and its distribution, degree and potential roles of asymptomatic carriers, progression of illness, and incubation period.

Unfortunately, the current available information on the cruise ship cluster is still rather limited. Outstanding questions include source(s) of infection, transmission chains, nature and degree of contact among the infected, secondary attack rates, and numbers of symptomatic and asymptomatic "infected" individuals.

A detailed epidemiologic study of this case cluster should help to elucidate many of the unanswered characteristics of the current 2019-nCoV outbreak -- which could be of immense help to current global public health control efforts. I sincerely hope that this opportunity would not be missed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Importance In December 2019, novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, China. The number of cases has increased rapidly but information on the clinical characteristics of affected patients is limited.

Objective
To describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of NCIP.

Design, setting, and participants
Retrospective, single-center case series of the 138 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan, China, from January 1 to January 28, 2020; final date of follow-up was February 3, 2020.

Exposures
Documented NCIP.

Main outcomes and measures
Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of critically ill patients and noncritically ill patients were compared. Presumed hospital-related transmission was suspected if a cluster of health professionals or hospitalized patients in the same wards became infected and a possible source of infection could be tracked.

Results
Of 138 hospitalized patients with NCIP, the median age was 56 years (interquartile range {IQR} 42-68; range, 22-92 years) and 75 (54.3%) were men. Hospital-associated transmission was suspected as the presumed mechanism of infection for affected health professionals (40 [29%]) and hospitalized patients (17 [12.3%]). Common symptoms included fever (136 [98.6%]), fatigue (96 [69.6%]), and dry cough (82 [59.4%]). Lymphopenia (lymphocyte count, 0.8 billion/L [IQR 0.6-1.1]) occurred in 97 patients (70.3%), prolonged prothrombin time (13.0 seconds [IQR, 12.3-13.7]) in 80 patients (58%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (261 U/L [IQR, 182-403]) in 55 patients (39.9%). Chest computed tomographic scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all patients. Most patients received antiviral therapy (oseltamivir, 124 [89.9%]), and many received antibacterial therapy (moxifloxacin, 89 [64.4%]; ceftriaxone, 34 [24.6%]; azithromycin, 25 [18.1%]) and glucocorticoid therapy (62 [44.9%]). 36 patients (26.1%) were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (22 [61.1%]), arrhythmia (16 [44.4%]), and shock (11 [30.6%]). The median time from 1st symptom to dyspnea was 5.0 days, to hospital admission was 7.0 days, and to ARDS was 8.0 days. Patients treated in the ICU (n=36), compared with patients not treated in the ICU (n=102), were older (median, 66 years vs 51 years), were more likely to have underlying comorbidities (26 [72.2%] vs 38 [37.3%]), and were more likely to have dyspnea (23 [63.9%] vs 20 [19.6%]), and anorexia (24 [66.7%] vs 31 [30.4%]). Of the 36 cases in the ICU, 4 (11.1%) received high-flow oxygen therapy, 15 (41.7%) received noninvasive ventilation, and 17 (47.2%) received invasive ventilation (4 were switched to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). As of [3 Feb 2020, 47 patients (34.1%) were discharged and 6 died (overall mortality, 4.3%), but the remaining patients are still hospitalized. Among those discharged alive (nâ=â47), the median hospital stay was 10 days (IQR, 7.0-14.0).

Conclusions and relevance
In this single-center case series of 138 hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP in Wuhan, China, presumed hospital-related transmission of 2019-nCoV was suspected in 41% of patients, 26% of patients received ICU care, and mortality was 4.3%.

[In addition to the primary symptoms described above, the authors noted that 14 patients (10.1%) presented initially with diarrhea and nausea 1 to 2 days prior to development of fever and dyspnea. Important to note the possibility of virus shedding from the GI (gastrointestinal) tract.

The article delineated nosocomial transmission in the hospital, with "57 (41.3%) of the 138 patients were presumed to have been infected in the hospital setting. This included 7 patients (12.3%) who were hospitalized for other reasons and 40 health care workers (29%). Of the hospitalized patients, 7 patients were from the surgical department, 5 were from internal medicine, and 5 were from the oncology department. Of the infected health care workers, 31 (77.5%) worked on general wards, 7 (17.5%) in the emergency department, and 2 (5%) in the ICU. One patient in the current study presented with abdominal symptoms and was admitted to the surgical department. More than 10 health care workers in this department were presumed to have been infected by this patient. Patient-to-patient transmission also was presumed to have occurred, and at least 4 hospitalized patients in the same ward were infected, and all presented with atypical abdominal symptoms. One of the 4 patients had fever and was diagnosed as having nCoV infection during hospitalization. Then, the patient was isolated. Subsequently, the other 3 patients in the same ward had fever, presented with abdominal symptoms, and were diagnosed as having nCoV infection." - Mod.MPP]
