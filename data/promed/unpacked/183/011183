Scaly-breasted Munia tested positive for H5N1 virus
-----------------------------------------------
The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) said today [6
Jan 2007] that the scaly-breasted Munia found dead in Causeway Bay was
confirmed to be H5N1-positive after a series of laboratory tests.
The carcass was collected by AFCD staff in Leighton Road following a public
referral on 31 Dec 2006.
A department spokesman reminded people to observe good personal hygiene.
"They should avoid personal contact with wild birds and live poultry and
clean their hands thoroughly after coming into contact with them," he said.

This may be of interest regarding the scaly-breasted Munia: As with records
of dead birds with H5N1 early last year [2006], this is an oddity. Leighton
Road is a curious location for finding a "wild" bird of almost any kind;
one might see sparrows, but I've walked along quite often and not noticed
any birds there. It's urban and more than a stone's throw from even
Victoria Park.
The species is odd too. I haven't seen this species in urban HK, not even
in parks. I've mainly seen it in rural spots, especially in grassy areas
such as former rice fields and wetlands near Deep Bay. I have seen it on
Cheung Chau, where I live, but only occasionally, so there is some evidence
of wandering. According to the HK Bird-watching Society website, this is
one of the 2 most commonly released species at temples, released so people
can supposedly get a karma boost.
There is more information in the thread on the HKBWS site -- including a
distribution map showing that this species wasn't mapped in urban areas,
including Causeway Bay -- as well as an article from the South China
Morning Post on a possible link to bird releases, including the following:
"Richard Corlett, professor of ecology and biodiversity at the University
of Hong Kong, said a complete ban on releasing birds was preferable. 'It is
a danger to public health, because the sellers and buyers come into contact
with birds and bird droppings with none of the precautions that are taken
with poultry, and the birds are then released into the environment', he said.
A study by a post-doctoral student last year [2006] estimated that between
500 000 and a million birds are imported for release every year, Professor
Corlett said. '[These birds] are mostly caught in China. They are not
vaccinated, quarantined or inspected, and they were transported into Hong
Kong in appallingly dirty and crowded conditions. Many of them are sick and
injured,' he said." See

[This would tend to confirm Joe Dudley's prior comment that the sick and
dead Munia were not "wild," at least not in the strict sense of that word.
Our thanks to Mark and Martin for their input. - Mod.MHJ]

[3] Smuggled birds out of China into Viet Nam
Date: 3 Jan 2007
From: Dave Halvorson <halvo002@umn.edu>

Your comments [on the weak actions by the relevant authorities] are true,
but the problem is the 5-fold difference in value of the chicken in China
vs. Viet Nam and the need for people to find food for themselves and their
families.
For a Southeast Asian farmer to lose a chicken is approximately similar to
one of us losing a whole cow. Then, when word gets out that Joe Blow's
chicken (or cow) was killed, but 2 months later he is still waiting for
compensation, how motivated will I be to volunteer that I have sick
chickens (or cows)? No, better to sell them or else kill and eat them.
This is similar to the difference in the U.S. in the value of fowl in the
countryside vs. the live poultry markets of New York City and surrounding
area. Our per capita income is about 10 000 times higher than much of SE
Asia, and yet there is a thriving business moving chickens from the
countryside into the city.
I find it hard to believe that it is possible to regulate HPAI out of
existence by controlling the activities of millions of people trying to
make a buck and feed their families. Rather, it seems to me that efforts
should be directed at providing chickens that are safe to move and
establishing a system of chicken production and marketing that reduces the
ability of the HPAI virus to move about.

[In addition to what Dave says, we have a parallel situation in the US over
the smuggling of drugs from Central and South America, where the production
costs are trivial but the street price in the US is not. And as a result,
we are essentially flooded with the said drugs and their associated
problems, and only a trivial proportion are caught in transit.
From the original report, there was also criminal involvement in the
Chinese chicken export trade in that corner of Viet Nam. The last Newcastle
disease epidemic in Southern California and western Texas revealed that
part of that problem was the covert movement of fighting cocks. In
discussions with my veterinary colleagues at that time, it was clear that
most of the aficionados of that sport carry their birds from place to place
but that some, especially top quality breeding stock, had wings without
feathers, and this involved significant distances. - Mod.MHJ]
