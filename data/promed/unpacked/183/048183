Deadly bird viruses now in Australia, scientists say
----------------------------------------------------
Scientists claim at least 3 deadly contagious bird diseases have
bypassed Australia's quarantine controls and will spread to native
parrots and cockatoos.
The Pacific region wildlife trade watchdog, Traffic Oceania, has also
urged the Federal Government to introduce a compulsory DNA register
of all exotic pet birds in Australia to control bird smuggling and
the disease risks it poses to native species. One of the newly
arrived contagious bird diseases, Pacheco's virus, which kills birds
within 48 hours, is thought to have caused the deaths last year of 46
orange-bellied parrot chicks at a captive breeding aviary in Hobart
[capital of Tasmania].
The other 2 recent arrivals are proventricular dilatation disease,
also known as macaw wasting disease, and an avian papilloma virus.
Tasmanian bird disease expert Dr. James Harris and Charles Sturt
University veterinary professor Shane Raidal said orange-bellied
parrot chicks captive-bred at Adelaide Zoo could have caught
Pacheco's virus from a seized consignment of smuggled South American
parrots. The parrots were temporarily housed at the zoo's quarantine
facilities after being confiscated by enforcement authorities.
Research suggests the virus can be transmitted by human handling or
on clothing in a manner similar to equine influenza.
The director of the University of Sydney 's wildlife health centre,
Professor David Phalen, said, "There's no question about it Pacheco's
disease is already here. It's got into this country somehow, and
we've got to learn to deal with it".
Traffic Oceania director Glenn Sant said smuggling exotic birds into
Australia had increased after a compulsory federal registration
scheme for owners of exotic birds was disbanded in 2001 by former
environment minister Robert Hill. "When the government wound back
legislation controlling keeping of exotic birds, it created a huge
loophole allowing birds to be imported illegally because there was no
paperwork to prove origin of ownership. It created a massive problem
and the Government has known this all along," Sant said.
In a confidential report to the Government in 2005, Mr. Sant
recommended a DNA register of exotic birds to stamp out smuggling and
control the spread of new diseases to Australia's native birds. "The
Government must be prepared to invest in protection of Australia's
native bird species and their conservation status," he said.

[The Orange-bellied parrot is endangered because it is so rare (only
200 birds left) and its habitat is quickly disappearing. There are
only about 50 breeding pairs of this bird left. It only breeds in
one place in Tasmania, the Southwest National Park. - Mod.JW]

Pacheco's disease virus (PDV):
----------------------------
This disease is caused by a number of closely related members of the
herpesviridae. PDV was first recognized in Brazil where
aviculturalists began seeing birds dying only a few days after
becoming ill. The virus can start shedding in the feces and nasal
discharge of an infected bird in as little as 3-7 days after
infection. Considered highly contagious, PDV can spread rapidly
through an aviary. Often the 1st sign that the disease is present is
when a new bird is introduced to an aviary and healthy birds begin
mysteriously dying. Pacheco's disease is often fatal and affects
psittacines [parrot family] of all ages. New World psittacines seem
to be more susceptible to the disease than Old World psittacines.
Transmission of PDV is generally through infected feces and nasal
discharge. PDV remains remarkably stable outside the host body as a
dust or aerosol. This dust or aerosol contaminates the air that is
then inhaled by another possible host. Contaminated surfaces, food,
and drinking water may also contribute to the spread of the disease.
Birds can be asymptomatic [without symptoms] carriers of Pacheco's
virus. Some believe that any bird that has survived an outbreak of
the disease should be considered as a possible carrier. PDV can be
reactivated when the bird is under stress such as during breeding,
loss of mate, or change and environmental changes. Once it is
reactivated the virus is shed in large numbers in the feces of the
infected bird.
Unfortunately the clinical signs of PDV are not dramatically
different than that of other diseases affecting birds: ruffled
feathers, sinusitis, anorexia, diarrhea and conjunctivitis.
Acyclovir is effective against some strains of PDV but may cause
kidney damage. Acyclovir works best when treatment is started before
symptoms appear.

Macaw wasting disease
---------------------------
1st recognized in 1978 in macaws, it later became known as psittacine
wasting syndrome and then morphed into the name of Proventricular
Dilatation disease (PDD) some time after that. PDD is the name it is
currently known by.
PDD is a neurological disease whereby the nerves to the
proventriculus and the ventriculus are slowly destroyed. The
proventriculus is also known as the fore-stomach while the
ventriculus is more commonly known as the gizzard. Degeneration may
also occur to the upper portions of the small intestine.
As these organs are responsible for chopping, grinding and generally
starting digestion of the food, then those functions no longer occur.
Consequently, the food often stays in the these organs and portions
of the digestive tract much longer than normal, giving bacteria a
chance to accumulate and cause infection in these organs. The wall of
the proventriculus may become thin, even as more food is pushed in.
With thin walls the organ can rupture and food spills into the
abdominal cavity, resulting in infections and often death.
These birds often lose weight but have healthy appetites. There may
or may not be signs of vomiting or passing of undigested foods. These
signs may occur over a period of several weeks before the owner
notices the weight loss.
The exact cause and its transmission remain a mystery, but it is
believed that the incubation may be as long as 5-8 years. Naive birds
exposed to infected birds may remain unaffected for many years. On
the other extreme, it has been shown to affect birds as young as 10 weeks.
Currently there is no treatment for this disease.

Avian papilloma virus
-------------------------
This has been cloned and genetically sequenced. It may appear as
warty type growths on the eyes and beak commissure of birds.
Diseases move easily. The illegal exotic bird trade seems to thrive,
as do the diseases that affect the birds. - Mod.TG]
