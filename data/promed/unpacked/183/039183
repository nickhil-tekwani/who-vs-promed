2005/068; Recent studies on _Thecaphora solani_
-----------------------------------------------
Potato smut caused by _Thecaphora solani_ (EPPO A1 list) is a serious
disease of potato, only present in the Andean region of South
America, in Panama, and Mexico. It affects various cultivated species
of _Solanum_ (_S. tuberosum_, _S. andigenum_, _S. stoloniferum_) and
other _Solanaceae_ (e.g. _Lycopersicon_, _Datura stramonium_). Up
until now, the fungus has not been cultured or characterized in vitro.

In Chile, _T. solani_ was 1st reported in 1974 in region IV (region
of Coquimbo), where it has established in many soils causing
significant yield losses (more than 90 percent) in potato crops. The
disease was then reported in region VIII (region del Bio-Bio). In
1996, potato smut was discovered more than 1000 km further south from
its initial finding, in region IX (region de la Araucania) near
Carahue. As this represented a very serious threat to seed-potato
production areas, efforts were made to try to eradicate the disease
and to study the basic biological aspects of the pathogen and the disease.

Therefore, studies were done in Chile to culture _T. solani_ in
vitro, and to characterize the fungus by molecular methods. For the
1st time, _T. solani_ was cultured on solid and liquid growing media.
But this remained a laborious and difficult task, as only 7 of the 26
isolates studied could be cultured. This was mainly due to the low
germination capacity of _T. solani_ teliospores.

The sexual cycle of the pathogen was completed under laboratory
conditions. 1st attempts to reproduce the disease under controlled
conditions were also successful. Artificial inoculation of mycelia to
potato explants grown in vitro (_S. tuberosum_ cv. 'Desiree') induced
a gall. Molecular analysis also confirmed the initial classification
of _T. solani_ in the genus _Thecaphora_ (it had been suggested at
one point that it belonged to the genus _Angiosorus_).

[Potato smut [PS] is 1 of the most destructive fungal diseases
affecting potato (_Solanum tuberosum_) in the Andean region of South
America, producing yield losses of up to 85 percent. It is also
recorded from areas of Panama and Mexico, but there are no reports of
PS elsewhere worldwide. PS affects various cultivated species of
_Solanum_, such as _S. tuberosum_, _S. andigenum_ (Andigena), and _S.
stoloniferum_. It also has been reported on tomato (_Lycopersicon_),
and on some common weeds such as _Datura stramonium_. _T. solani_
survives in soil or in tuber debris, and its spores are thought to be
long-lived, though it is not known how long they are viable. Pathogen
incidence is increased in the absence of crop rotation and is favored
by high humidity and saline soils.

Field observations indicate that seed tubers transmit the disease. PS
has a very low natural dispersal potential. The most likely way in
which PS could enter un-infested areas would be with potato tubers.
It has been intercepted by the USDA in 52 consignments of tubers of
_Solanum tuberosum_ and _S. stoloniferum_, almost all from Mexico,
since 1946 (USDA Lists of Intercepted Plant Pests). Soil from
infected areas could also introduce the fungus. PS is reported to be
serious, accompanied by losses of up to 80 percent in the very
susceptible cultivar Peruanita.

In Peru field trials, methyl bromide and dazomet, used as soil
dis-infestants against _T. solani_, reduced the weight of
hypertrophied tubers considerably (but did not eliminate the fungus).
Susceptibility to infection varies, some cultivars being resistant.
Resistance screening is actively being pursued at CIP (International
Potato Center) in Peru.

General control measures recommended are: use of resistant cultivars,
planting of smut-free seed potatoes, long rotation, elimination of
the weed _Datura stramonium_ (also reported as a host), and removal
of smutted galls.
