Hepatitis A in the European Union: responding to challenges related
to new epidemiological patterns
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[Authors: L Payne, D Coulombier
European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, Stockholm, Sweden]

Hepatitis A is a vaccine-preventable acute, usually self-limiting
disease caused by infection with hepatitis A virus (HAV).
Transmission is usually by the faecal-oral route, including via
person-to-person spread, contaminated water or food products. It has
also been associated with injecting drug use and outbreaks among men
having sex with men.

In the European Union (EU), though figures may vary among countries,
the overall incidence of hepatitis A has decreased over the last 10
years from 15.1 per 100 000 population in 1996 to 3.9 per 100 000 in
2006 (1). This decreasing trend has been attributed to continued
improved sanitary and living conditions, with reduced exposure to
infection, especially in early childhood. However, reduction in
circulation of HAV leads to decreased acquisition of immunity and, in
the absence of universal vaccination, an accumulation of susceptible
individuals.

The impact of increasing susceptibility of the general population on
the risk for outbreaks is clearly illustrated in independent
outbreaks in Czech Republic, Latvia, and Slovakia in 2008, described
in 3 of the articles published in this week's issue of
Eurosurveillance (2-4). In these papers, the authors describe the
extent to which hepatitis A can spread within at-risk susceptible
populations and in the cases of Czech Republic and Latvia within the
general population. In these reports, a significant proportion of
cases are young adults, resulting in potentially more severe clinical
presentation and posing a challenge to the health authorities in the
area of safety of blood and tissue donation.

Experiences from the response to these outbreaks were the focus of a
technical meeting organised by the European Centre for Disease
Prevention and Control (ECDC) in collaboration with the Latvian
Public Health Agency in Riga in November 2008, where the
epidemiological pattern of hepatitis A outbreaks was reviewed, as
well as the role of vaccination in outbreak settings. Discussions
highlighted the fact that emergence of outbreaks in the EU generally
follows the introduction of the virus from endemic countries through
"seeding events." Non-immunised travellers to endemic areas are often
at the origin of seeding events, as shown in this week's issue of
Eurosurveillance in the three articles from France, Belgium, and
Germany (5-7), which describe clusters of travel-related cases
following visits to Egypt.

To prevent the introduction of HAV in the EU travellers to endemic
countries need to be vaccinated, and indeed vaccination for
travellers is recommended by the national guidelines of these 3
countries. However, as the authors point out, none of the cases
reported in their articles had been vaccinated. These clusters
therefore highlight the importance of effective travel medicine
advice reaching EU travellers of all age groups.

Seeding events can be self-contained. However, when occurring in
at-risk settings or communities, HAV transmission may be "amplified"
and result in a wide spread of the disease, as described among
injecting drug users in the reports by Czech Republic and Latvia, as
well as among Roma populations as reported by Slovakia. Similarly,
infected food-handlers may contribute to transmission amplification.
Introduction of HAV by children attending day care centres or primary
schools represents another type of situations at risk of increased
transmission. The Slovak experience shows that immunisation targeting
at-risk communities following such introduction may prevent the
spread to the general community. However, the Czech example shows
that such a strategy for control may not be effective with
hard-to-reach communities such as injecting drug users.

Once the outbreak spreads to the general population, vaccination of
contacts, as carried out in Czech Republic, represents an option to
complement isolation of cases and health education measures, if done
within a few days from exposure. Currently, there is no
evidence-based guidance available regarding the use of HAV vaccine in
outbreak control.

Though the total number of cases may be decreasing yearly in the EU,
the articles published in this edition of Eurosurveillance indicate
that hepatitis A is still an important public health issue, and
highlight the need for increased awareness of both the risk of
infection to the individual and the possibility of community
outbreaks within a changing EU epidemiology. As HAV vaccination is
not included in universal immunisation schedules, the EU is likely to
experience similar outbreaks in the future. This stresses the need to
promote immunisation of all travellers to endemic areas to prevent
return introduction and to develop evidence-based guidance for
outbreak control strategies.

Summary
-------
Since September 2008, 26 cases of hepatitis A with a history of
travel to Egypt have been reported in France. Investigations indicate
that a common source of contamination linked to Nile river cruises is
the most likely explanation of the increase in the number of cases
reported in France as well as in several other European Union countries.

Summary
-------
Following a European alert by France, we detected a hepatitis A
cluster in Belgian travellers returning from Egypt. Our investigation
supports the hypothesis of a common source outbreak, linked to Nile
river cruises. The outbreak also suggests the need to consider an
intensification of the vaccination policy for travellers to hepatitis
A endemic countries.

Cluster of hepatitis A cases among travellers returning from Egypt,
Germany, September through November 2008
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[Authors: H Bernard, C Frank
Robert Koch Institute, Department for Infectious Disease
Epidemiology, Berlin, Germany]

Summary
-------
From September to November 2008, 34 cases of hepatitis A imported
from Egypt were reported to the German public health authorities.
Investigations point to a continuing common source of infection, most
likely linked to Nile river cruises. The patients affected had not
been vaccinated, which emphasises the need for more effective travel
advice before trips to hepatitis A endemic countries.

promote immunisation of all travellers to endemic areas to prevent
reintroduction of hepatitis A virus into a largely susceptible
population, and to develop outbreak control strategies. - Mod.CP]
