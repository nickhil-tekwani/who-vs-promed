[The last few cases were at least two weeks ago - P.S.
Sunday, October 26, 1997
Eight confirmed cases of dengue have been discovered in Belize District
[i.e. Belize City, setting off alarm signals that there are many more
cases which have gone unreported.
Health and hospital authorities estimate that for every case of dengue
reported, there are nine others which go unreported. [Actually, 90 would be
a much closer estimate - P.S.
The diagnostic reports from culture samples sent abroad confirm that Belize
has type one and type three Dengue. Type two, the hemorrhagic or deadly
variety has not been found, but may well be present. [This is quite
possible in view of identifying two serotypes in just 8 samples for the
entire country - P.S.
The news has sent health authorities scurrying to set up defensive
barricades against the responsible _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, which thrives
in well populated areas and never travels far from home. The eggs of
_Aedes aegypti_ can survive for nine months without water. ... water brings
the eggs to life, and these create a swarm of mosquitoes which repeat the
egg-laying cycle.
Dr. Jorge Polanco, government epidemiologist, has said that Hemorrhagic
Dengue is a sort of second generation dengue, causing bleeding of the
gums,nose and internal organs and can often result in death.
The most practical defense against Dengue is to get rid of the _Aedes
aegypti_ mosquito by eliminating the breeding grounds and getting rid of
all stagnant water. [In fact, they don't breed in stagnant ground pools,
drains or sewers, but in rainwater trapped in discarded cans or tires, or
clean water stored for drinking in barrels and cisterns - Mod.JW
