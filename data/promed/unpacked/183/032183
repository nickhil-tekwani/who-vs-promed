[Wild birds appear to be playing an important role in the spread and maintenance of HPAI H5N1. Most wild birds reported infected have been Anseriformes (swan, ducks, geese), followed by birds of prey. The Eurasian curlew (_Numenius arquata_) is a wader (see image at https://www.flickr.com/photos/32504429@N06/38278085466). Waders are aquatic migratory birds in the Order Charadriiformes. They also have been frequently reported infected by HPAI viruses. - Mod.PMB
