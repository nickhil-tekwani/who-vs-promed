Nevada Department of Wildlife fisheries biologist Chris Crookshanks says it appears thousands of trout, bass and catfish have died at Sparks Marina Park [Washoe County]. He says his agency began receiving reports of struggling fish at the 77-acre lake on Tuesday [17 Dec 2013] and more fish began washing up on shore Saturday night [21 Dec 2013].

Crookshanks says preliminary water testing shows low levels of oxygen near the cove and beach at the north end of Sparks Marina Lake where the die-off is concentrated.

According to the city of Sparks website, the lake is continuously recharged with fresh filtered water from an underground aquifer.

[It would be interesting to know whether there are tests being carried out to achieve a diagnosis. Low oxygen levels are a common cause of massive fish die-offs in lentic environments. These phenomena can be due to changes in the chemical and physical constitution of the water column due to eutrophication and lake inversion.
