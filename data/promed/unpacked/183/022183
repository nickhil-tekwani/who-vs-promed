[1] FMD suspected in (eastern) Algeria

Drastic measures are being undertaken, and significant resources are being mobilized against foot and mouth disease [FMD], a highly contagious bovine disease, in Algeria and other parts of Northern Africa. Livestock has been affected in the eastern part of Algeria. Vaccinations, stricter monitoring, trade restrictions, and quarantine coupled with the occasional slaughter of contaminated animals are among the measures being taken to contain this infectious and frequently fatal viral disease.

[Confirmation or otherwise of the presence and spread of FMD in east Algeria is anticipated; if affirmative, official notification to the OIE is anticipated. - Mod.AS]

[2] Mass vaccination of cattle in (east) Algeria

About 100 500 cattle have already been vaccinated against FMD in the area covering the wilayas (govrnorates) of El Tarf, Souk Ahras, El Oued, and Tebessa, along the border with Tunisia, the director of agriculture in the governorate of El Tarf, Yacine Kourd, said on Monday [26 May 2014].

[Since general vaccination is, reportedly, annually applied in Algeria, it will be interesting to note which vaccine strain is applied in the described (re)vaccinations in eastern Algeria, and whether vaccination of small ruminants is contemplated. - Mod.AS]

[3] Tunisia: DEFRA's assessment

This is the 1st report of FMD since 1999 in Tunisia. Annual vaccination is carried out as part of the OIE Official Control Programme, and the programme includes vaccination against type O. Disease control measures are in place. According to the report, the source of disease is illegal movement of animals.

According to the World Reference Laboratory for FMD (Pirbright Institute, 2013), there have been several incursions into the Middle East and North Africa of FMD O ME-SA [India 2001 strain] from South Asia in the last year or so. The viruses in Libya and Saudi Arabia are closely related to these strains and have been given the lineage nomenclature of KAR-13. It is quite possible that [the actual strain present in Tunisia is] a similar or related strain, but it will be important to understand whether these were unvaccinated animals or whether there has been vaccine failure.

[The Maghreb countries Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia have not notified any FMD case since 1999. In May 2012, these countries obtained, through a joint approach, the OIE endorsement of their FMD national official control programs, consistent with the FAO/OIE FMD progressive control pathway (FMD-PCP), which aims at obtaining an FMD-free status, with or without vaccination. The endorsement is subject to annual re-confirmation after exchanges of information between OIE and each country to see that the program remains relevant to existing or emerging risks. Algeria and Tunisia practise annual vaccination; Morocco stopped vaccinating in 2007. The current development may challenge the target. See the relevant comment in ProMED posting 20140522.2491636.

According to Tunisia's epidemiological comment, the "source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection" was "illegal movement of animals." Tunisia borders just 2 countries: Libya and Algeria. This does not leave much room for speculation about the transboundary origin of the virus.

The spread of FMD serotype O in Tunisia (and eastern Algeria?), in spite of the mass vaccination, highlights the need to genotype the virus strain and to check the matching of the vaccine applied to protect against the circulating strain.

Interesting, relevant information about the Libyan virus is available in the WRLFMD Quarterly Report of October-December 2013, available at http://www.wrlfmd.org/ref_labs/ref_lab_reports/OIE-FAO%20FMD%20Ref%20Lab%20Report%20Oct-Dec%202013.pdf.

Here are some useful excerpts:

"Samples collected from FMD outbreaks in Libya (collected from cattle between September and December 2013) and sent via Dr. E. Brocchi, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna (IZSLER), Brescia, Italy, revealed the presence of FMDV type O. Genotyping showed that the virus belonged to the ME-SA topotype, Ind-2001 lineage. Sequence comparisons by the PD-FMD (Mukteswar, India), showed that the Libyan virus was closely related to a newly identified sub-lineage of Ind-2001, which they named KAR-13" (see Fig. 1 "Phylogenetic comparison of VP1 sequences from O-Ind-2001 from Bhutan, Libya and Saudi Arabia with recent viruses from India," on page 17 of the report).

The report included the following comment addressing vaccine matching:

"Two FMDV type O isolates from Libya and 4 FMDV type O isolates from Saudi Arabia were found to be of the ME-SA Ind-2001KAR-13 lineage. These were analysed using the 2 dimensional neutralisation tests (2dm-VNT) and matched with O 3039, O TAW/98, O TUR/5/09. However, only one out of these 6 O/ME-SA/Ind-2001KAR-13 isolates matched with 'O1 Manisa' (r1-value 0.33)." See also Annex 1, table C: "Vaccine Matching studies for Serotype O FMDV by VNT," (page 24).

According to the WRLFMD genotyping report, the strain most closely related (96.24 percent) to the Libyan strain is a 2009 strain from Bhutan O/BHU/3/2009.

Concluding:
1. Genotyping results of FMDV serotype O currently spreading in the Maghreb should be published at the earliest.
2. The efficacy of the vaccine applied in Tunisia and Algeria and its capacity to effectively protect against the circulating virus deserves to be assessed.
3. The situation in Algeria deserves clarification. In case the rumors (item 1) are accurate, official notification is anticipated. - Mod.AS
