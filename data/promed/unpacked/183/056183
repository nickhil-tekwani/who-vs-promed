MedExpress locations in the 9-county region including Beaver County have been inundated with 74 percent more cases of young adults with pneumonia between 2015 and 2016, and that rising trend is expected to continue.

Diana Burick, a physician's assistant at the MedExpress Center Township office, said college-aged individuals, those ages 18 to 25, are more susceptible to illnesses like pneumonia for variety of reasons. "You're thinking of folks that live in crowded conditions, like dorms. You're thinking of folks with maybe less than optimal eating habits, less than optimal sleep habits. Folks that maybe aren't practicing the best hand hygiene," Burick said. Those who smoke or have asthma also have an increased risk of contracting the flu or pneumonia. Pneumonia is an infection that can cause fluid buildup in the lungs, and in severe cases can cause breathing difficulties.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were 184 individuals ages 15 to 24 in the United States who died from influenza and pneumonia in 2015, which is a small fraction of the more than 57 000 people who died from influenza and pneumonia among all ages that year.

And MedExpress locations in the area have already seen more pneumonia cases this year [2017] than in all of 2016. Symptoms can sometimes vary with pneumonia, and it can evolve from the flu due to a compromised immune system.

"When you're thinking of the classic symptoms, it's a cough that is persistent, and you're thinking of a fever. Typically a higher fever within that 100-point mark; most folks tend to have that fatigue, that malaise, just not feeling well sensation," Burick said. "At the same point, it's not always isolation of symptoms. Some people are also coming in with those flu-like symptoms."

The most common form of pneumonia is bacterial, meaning it can be treated with antibiotics. But other forms can be viral or fungal, meaning the illness needs to run its course. The most important thing people should be aware of is prevention techniques, Burick said. "Practicing great hand hygiene, being cautious not to share food or drinks," she said. "It might sound silly, but making sure you're getting adequate sleep and paying attention to your diet."

[The news report above says that there has been 74 percent more cases of young adults with pneumonia between 2015 and 2016 than previously in a 9-county region that includes Beaver County in the US state of Pennsylvania, but fails to indicate what these counties are or to give the microbial causes for this increase.

Center Township, a suburban community approximately 25 mi (40 km) northwest of Pittsburgh, is located in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, United States (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_Township,_Beaver_County,_Pennsylvania). Beaver County is on the border with the states of West Virginia and Ohio (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaver_County,_Pennsylvania#Adjacent_counties) and is part of the Pittsburgh, PA Metropolitan Statistical Area. Adjacent counties are Lawrence (north), Butler (east), Allegheny (southeast), Washington (south), Hancock, West Virginia (west) and Columbiana, Ohio (west).

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) can be caused by a variety of microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, and, less commonly, fungi. Common bacterial causes of CAP in the United States are _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ (also called pneumococcus), _Legionella pneumophila_, _Staphylococcus aureus_, _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_, and _Chlamydia pnueumoniae_. Outbreaks of CAP caused by M. pneumoniae occur mostly in crowded environments, like households, schools, college dormitories, and military barracks, when coughing releases small droplets of respiratory secretions into the air that are inhaled by close contacts. The opioid epidemic in the U.S. could also be causing an increase in cases of CAP as a result of aspiration of anaerobic bacterial mouth flora or as a result of injection drug use giving rise to hematogenous _Staphylococcus aureus_ pneumonia.

Viruses, such as influenza, also can cause of outbreaks of CAP. Travel-associated pneumonia may be caused by Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) indigenous to the Arabian Peninsula or H5N1 or H7N9 strains of avian influenza indigenous to Asia. Fungi rarely cause pneumonia in otherwise healthy people, but outbreaks of CAP caused by environmental fungi that are characteristic of certain regions of the U.S., such as _Histoplasma_, _Coccidioides_ and _Blastomyces_, can occasionally occur, when soil harboring these fungi are disturbed.

Further information on the clinical, microbiologic, and epidemiologic characteristics of this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
