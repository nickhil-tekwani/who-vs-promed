On Wed 25 Aug 2010, we received notification that pathogenic
Newcastle Disease has been found in double-crested cormorants on
Pilot and Spider Islands, off the tip of the Door County, Wisconsin,
peninsula. We are notifying registered poultry premises in eastern
Wisconsin about this finding to provide information about the
disease, along with contact information if you have more questions,
if you find dead birds near your premises, or if you see any unusual
symptoms in your birds.

Newcastle disease is relatively common among cormorants. Usually they
contract the non-pathogenic form of the disease, meaning it does not
make them ill. In this case, tests showed it to be the more virulent,
or pathogenic, form of Newcastle in some of the dead birds. In
addition, the birds also tested positive for botulism. Therefore,
it's unclear which disease killed them.

What is clear is that we've detected the pathogenic strain of
Newcastle disease, and you should be aware of that fact as a poultry
owner. It is unlikely that domestic poultry will be infected by
cormorants, but possible. In previous outbreaks in the United States,
Newcastle disease has been transmitted to domestic poultry only once
from cormorants.

The other thing you need to know is that there is no human health
risk associated with either form of Newcastle disease.

The disease has also been found this summer in Illinois, Minnesota,
North Dakota, and Ontario, Canada. It is expected that the cormorants
currently in or near Door County will soon begin to migrate likely
following the Western shore of Lake Michigan, so they could spread
the disease to those areas.

The USDA Wildlife Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the
Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources will continue to monitor
this disease. If you aren't already limiting your birds' exposure to
wild birds, especially migratory waterfowl, I recommend that you do
so now. In addition watch for these signs and symptoms:

Respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, gasping, coughing and nasal discharge
* Diarrhea
* Low energy and loss of appetite
* Drop in egg production or misshapen and soft-shelled eggs
* Nervous system impairment such as trembling, drooping wings,
circling, and twisting or paralysis of the head and neck
* Swelling around the head
* Purple discoloration of the wattles, combs and legs, tremors,
drooping wings, circling, and twisting the head and neck

If you see any of these signs, call your veterinarian immediately. If
you see dead wild birds, call the Wisconsin Deadbird Hotline at 1-800-433-1610.

Many poultry diseases are transmitted through direct contact between
birds and from bodily discharges from sick birds. Viruses and
bacteria can be carried on shoes, clothing, tools, and vehicles. You
can pick up viruses or bacteria on your hands or clothing or in your
nasal passages and transmit it to birds. Here are some additional
reminders on basic biosecurity practices:

* Avoid exposing your flock to wild birds
* Restrict vehicle and foot traffic near your birds
* Disinfect shoes, clothing, hands, egg trays or flats, crates,
vehicles and tires, particularly after visiting other poultry farms
or fairs, shows and exhibits
* Buy birds only from reputable dealers and ask for certification
that birds were legally imported
* Keep new birds separated from the rest of the flock for at least 30 days
* Keep young and old birds, birds of different species, and birds
from different sources separated
* Keep records of all sales and shipments

If you have questions, you can call the Animal Health Division at
608-224-4872. You can also send an e-mail to
<animals@datcp.state.wi.us>. If you e-mail us, please include a phone
number. It's often easier to answer questions in detail by phone
rather than e-mail, and we're happy to call you.

[This letter was sent to the poultry owners in Wisconsin in an effort
to prepare them to be more conscious of disease in their area.

The letter indicates the disease has been found in several areas and
we are likely to see more reports of this disease as the water birds
began some of the fall migrations. - Mod.TG]
