Downy mildew on field cucumbers detected in Ontario
----------------------------------------------------
A pickling cucumber field in Ontario [Canada], east of Windsor, was
found to have downy mildew. It is thought that the infection occurred
within the last week. In past years, Michigan [USA] has found its 1st
outbreak 5 to 14 days after an Ontario report. Therefore, Michigan
growers are advised to begin a preventive spray program immediately.
Downy mildew is well-known for causing catastrophic losses in a brief
period of time.

This downy mildew pathogen is resistant to commonly used fungicides.
Results from our 2005-10 research identified a limited number of
fungicides that are effective, but must be applied every 5 days when
the weather favors disease.

Fungus wreaks havoc on Michigan crops
-------------------------------------
A devastating fungus that can affect anything that grows on a vine is
wreaking havoc on some Michigan farms. The Downy Mildew fungus spreads
by air, usually originating in the southern US. It can also spread by
transplants brought to local greenhouses. "You never know when it'll
show up, and it's very difficult to control," said Jason Ruhlig,
Ruhlig's Farms and Greenhouses. He says if the fungus strikes early
enough, it can cut cucumber yield by as much as 60 percent. "You see
yellowing in the cucumbers," he said. "Nobody wants a yellow
cucumber."

No plants are completely resistant to the fungus, but farmers can try
to prevent it by raising tolerant varieties of crops and using
fungicides.

[Downy mildew caused by the fungus _Pseudoperonospora cubensis_ is a
devastating disease of cucurbits. _P. cubensis_ is found worldwide,
but it is usually most damaging in tropical and subtropical areas.
Different pathogen strains with variable host preferences (pathovars)
seem to exist and, for example, a strain that affects cucumbers may
not necessarily affect melons. By affecting the leaves and thus the
photosynthetic potential of its host, downy mildew reduces yield and
fruit quality and it can eventually kill the host plant. Under
favourable conditions, plantings can be infected so rapidly that they
appear to have been frosted.

The fungus is an obligate parasite surviving on cultivated or wild
cucurbits and volunteer crop plants, or cucurbit weeds may serve as
sources of inoculum. The disease is spread by wind, rain splash, and
mechanical means. Disease development can occur over a wide
temperature range under conditions of high humidity. Control
strategies include the use of resistant cultivars as well as
applications of protectant and systemic fungicides.

In 2007, a new virulent strain of the fungus was reported in the US
from South Carolina (ProMED-mail post 20071023.3448), but it is not
clear which strains are involved in the outbreak reported above.
