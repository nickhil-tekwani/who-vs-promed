There was the name of a website scrawled on cardboard and quickly torn to
bits by an anonymous farmer in the Greenmarket at Union Square. Then came
the paperwork, legal enough presumably, to protect the source of the
illicit substance. Finally, Yaron Milgrom-Elcott received the monthly drop
site: an address near Chelsea [a neighborhood in lower Manhattan, New York
- Mod.LL], open for 2 hours, show up or lose the white stuff.
Mr Milgrom-Elcott never missed a drop. Each month, he joined mothers with
newborns and Wall Street titans in search of a box of unpasteurized,
unhomogenized, raw milk. He is also part of a movement of perhaps hundreds
of thousands across the country who will risk illness or even death to
drink their milk the way Americans did for centuries: straight from the cow.
20 years ago, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned interstate
sales of unpasteurized milk. This spring [2007] the agency warned consumers
again that they were risking their health drinking raw milk. Still,
individual states determine how raw milk is bought and sold within their
borders. While its sale for human consumption is illegal in 15 states, New
York is one of 26 where it can be bought with restrictions. The chief one
is that raw milk can only be sold on the premises of one of 19 dairy farms
approved by the state. Clandestine milk clubs, like the one Mr
Milgrom-Elcott joined, are one way of circumventing the law, and there are
others.
Raw milk drinkers may praise its richer flavor or claim it is more
nutritious than pasteurized milk. No matter why they drink it, the demand
for it is booming. In 2000, the Organic Pastures Dairy Company in the San
Joaquin Valley near Fresno became California's 1st raw milk dairy with
certified organic pasture land. This year [2007] its co-founder, Mark
McAfee, expects it to gross USD 6 million up from 4.9 in 2006.
His raw milk is sold in 300 stores in California, where it is legal. He
also has a USD 80 000 a month mail order business, shipping creams and
cheese as well as milk to all 50 states. He believes he reaches 35 000
customers a week for his raw milk products. Because the laws allow
interstate shipping of raw milk that is not meant for human consumption,
Organic Pastures milk is labeled as pet food.
"I like to go into the warehouse and see the addresses, it goes all over
creation," he said. "We don't have the same customers day in and day out.
We're the entry point. We hear back that shipping is too expensive but that
they found a local provider, either a farm or on the black market. They
have got to have it."
Mr McAfee said he knows firsthand of more than 6 dairies in Pennsylvania,
some of them Amish, that supply the black market in New York and Boston.
"They're sending in 200 cases of milk every month," he said.
Some drink it for the same reason raw milk cheeses are popular: the taste.
"I first discovered it 2 summers ago in France," said Mr Milgrom-Elcott,
who is pursuing a doctorate in medieval Jewish mysticism at New York
University. There is a richness and density unlike processed milk, plus
there's this complexity of flavor."
Others believe that it is good for them. Pasteurization, a process of
heating and quickly cooling milk to kill pathogens such as _Escherichia
coli_, salmonella, and listeria, also destroys beneficial bacteria,
proteins and enzymes, they say. Advocates attribute stronger immune and
better digestive systems to raw milk. Many have incorporated it into their
diet as part of a broader philosophy to treat their bodies and the planet
properly.
Nina Planck, the author of "Real Food: What to Eat and Why," defied the
FDA's warning and drank raw milk while she was pregnant. She not only
continues to drink it while nursing her 9 month old son, Julian, but also
allows him the occasional sip. She has an arrangement with a couple of
farmers to deliver it to New York City. "We drink raw milk because we trust
the traditional food chain more than the industrial one," said Ms Planck,
who knows a number of farmers from her days as director of the New York
City Greenmarkets and through her boyfriend, Rob Kaufelt, the owner of
Murray's Cheese in Greenwich Village. "We're willing to spend more money
the higher up the food chain we go," she said. "We're not alone, either.
You cannot categorize the people who are drinking raw milk. They are people
from the blue states and red states, farmers and yuppies, and Birkenstock
wearers."
Food scientists can hardly believe that so many consumers have turned their
back on one of the most successful public health endeavors of the 20th
century. In 1938, for example, milk caused 25 per cent of all outbreaks of
food and water related sickness. With the advent of universal
pasteurization, that number fell to one per cent by 1993, according to the
Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nutrition advocacy group in
Washington.
David Barbano, director of the Northeast Dairy Foods Research Center,
operated by Cornell and the University of Vermont and supported by the
dairy industry, grew up drinking raw milk on a family farm. He does not
remember ever getting sick, but says science has never found any evidence
that it was more beneficial than pasteurized milk. In fact, he said, raw
milk has very little vitamin D, which is added to most pasteurized milk.
"There is always going to be a percentage of raw milk that carries
disease-causing bacteria," said Dr Barbano, who is a professor of food
science at Cornell. "As long as I have pasteurized milk available for me,
and I guess more importantly for my daughter, the risk is not worth any
benefit anyone has been able to prove."
Sally Fallon, president of the Westin A Price Foundation, another nutrition
advocacy group, argues that the risk to raw milk drinkers is insignificant,
and the demand for product is growing steadily. In 1998, when the
Washington-based foundation created the website 'realmilk.com', it barely
had half a page of sources where raw milk could be purchased legally. Now,
the list has grown to more than 2 dozen pages, and Ms Fallon puts the
number of raw milk drinkers at half a million. "We are trying to be
pragmatic and create demand," said Ms Fallon of the 10 000 member, 400
chapter foundation, which has mounted legal challenges to raw milk
regulations in several states. "Even though it is illegal in some places,
it is very available through cow sharing or cow herding programs."
In Virginia, for example, Chip and Susan Planck (Nina's parents) pay USD 40
a year plus USD 25 monthly to own a share in a cow, the only legal way to
get raw milk in that state. In return, they get a gallon of raw milk a
week. It is technically not a sale but compensation for the cow's room and
board.
In 2006, the Hawthorne Valley Farm in Ghent, NY, offered a buyers' club
program to its raw milk customers in the hopes of giving a bigger boost to
a steadily growing market. It was designed to encourage those customers in
New York and beyond to order in bulk but send only a single representative
a week to pick up the order.
When the New York State Department Public Interest and Markets caught wind
of it, however, it asked Hawthorne to end the program and the farm
complied. Still, Abe Madey, the farm's dairy manager and cheese maker, says
business is steady. About 100 regular customers, many of whom drive 2 hours
from New York City, purchase up to 7500 gallons annually of raw milk worth
about USD 45 000 to the farm, he said.
The milk club that Mr Milgrom-Elcott belongs to, and others like it, is far
more problematic, according to Jessica A Chittenden, a spokeswoman for the
Agriculture and Markets department. She says the 41 milk inspectors charged
with the monthly testing of New York's 5000 dairy farms had not yet turned
their attention to the clandestine drop-offs. "It is under review," said Ms
Chittenden, adding that the department cited 5 of the raw milk permit
holders for violations in the past year. "Our utmost concern is for public
health. We are trying to insure that the safest products are out there."
For a few months anyhow, Mr Milgrom-Elcott can shed his identity of a
potential law-breaker. His wife, Miriam Sheinbein, just finished her 3rd
year at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and is currently serving a
brief rotation in San Francisco. In California, raw milk is legal and
widely available. While Ms Sheinbein, who is 19 weeks pregnant, has decided
to forego the delicacy until the baby is born, Mr Milgrom-Elcott is
delighted to take his habit above-ground.

Don't even try to separate Chris Schlicht from her unpasteurized milk. "You
bet I've got raw milk!" Schlicht wrote in a recent email message. "I can
say that raw milk and home-raised meat saved my life." Before she moved to
Gig Harbor, Washington, more than 20 years ago, Schlicht says she was
"sick, underweight, and having an impossible time trying to get pregnant."
Then she began drinking raw milk, planted a garden, and started raising her
own livestock for meat. "I gained weight and got pregnant in less than 6
months," she notes. "I've been drinking raw milk ever since." So do her
husband and her son, now 22.
If Schlicht, now also a raw milk producer, had to choose between no milk
and pasteurized milk, she says the choice would be easy: "I would do
without milk altogether."
She has company. A growing number of consumers are fighting to drink their
milk unpasteurized despite well-documented health risks and recent
outbreaks of serious infections tied to raw milk. From 1998 to 2005, the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) tied 45 outbreaks of
various foodborne diseases to unpasteurized milk or cheese. More than 1000
people became ill, 104 were hospitalized, and 2 died, according to CDC.
Drinking raw milk "is like playing Russian roulette," says Gregory Miller,
executive vice president of the National Dairy Council. "Why would you take
that risk?"
The FDA (Food and Drug Administration) agrees. It bans interstate sales of
raw milk and raw milk products. Agencies from the CDC to the WHO also warn
consumers against drinking unpasteurized milk although a few states,
including California and Washington, allow raw milk to be sold in stores.
Other states have laws originally crafted to let farmers share ownership of
livestock and consume the milk and other products they provide. Raw milk
advocates have started using those laws as loopholes to buy shares of
animals for their use, a practice that some states are trying to halt.
Last October 2006, Maryland adopted emergency regulations forbidding
farmers from selling shares of livestock to consumers. "We believe that it
is a sham to circumvent the law to do a cow share," says Ted Elkin, deputy
director of Maryland's Office of Food Protection and Consumer Health
Services. The push to make raw milk available "seems like a very dangerous
idea," says Elkin, who notes that what proponents of raw milk "call 'life
forces,' we call bacteria."
In July 2007, US Department of Agriculture (USDA) scientists reported that
nearly a quarter of the raw milk collected from 861 farms in 21 states
contained bacteria linked to human illness. Among the results, 5 per cent
of samples contained _Listeria_, 3 per cent had _Salmonella_, and 4 per
cent had types of _E. coli_ that can cause diarrhea and other
gastrointestinal illnesses. Less than one per cent had the most dangerous
form of _E. coli_, O157:H7.
Raw milk has "measurable levels [of unhealthy bacteria] and they are
probably more prevalent than what we are seeing," said Jeffrey Karns, a
microbiologist at the USDA's Environmental Microbial Safety Laboratory in
Beltsville, MD, who led the study.
"You aren't going to change the amount of calcium in a glass of milk by not
heating it," says Stuart Patton, professor emeritus of dairy science at
Penn State. Pasteurization may destroy a small percentage of B vitamins,
particularly thiamine, and about 20 per cent of the vitamin C in milk,
Patton says. But milk is not a major source of either one.
The debate over raw milk is one that Patton, 84, has heard often in his
long career. "There can be all kinds of speculations based on people's
hopes and wishes," he says. "But until there are really good studies that
show clearly the difference between raw and pasteurized milk, you are just
dreaming. The milk is still the milk. Pasteurization is such minimal
treatment that it does not change milk chemically very much."
Peggy Thiel, 52, of Spring Grove, Pennsylvania, agrees. She grew up
drinking raw milk on her family's dairy farm in Wisconsin and learned the
benefits of pasteurization the hard way. Thiel says that she and her older
brother were often sick until their family doctor urged her mother to begin
pasteurizing their milk. After that, their health improved. That was enough
proof for Thiel, who says, "I have no desire to drink raw milk."
