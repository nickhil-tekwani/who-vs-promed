A study just published seems to show that honey bees [_Apis_ spp] can be exposed to sub-lethal levels of widely used fungicides which will make them more at risk from the gut parasite _Nosema ceranae_. The researchers examined the pollen across beehives across a wide range of crops in the United States of America and identified 35 different pesticides. Of particular interest were high levels of fungicides.

While fungicides are typically considered as fairly safe for honey bees, the researchers found an increased probability of nosema infection in bees that consumed pollen with a higher fungicide load. These results highlight a need for research on sub-lethal effects of fungicides and other chemicals that bees are exposed to.

_Nosema_ spp are of particular concern for beekeepers due to the damage the parasite can do to the entire colony. It has been implicated in complete colony collapse. The parasite leads to reduced ability for the bees to overwinter. It can also lead to poor bee performance the following spring. If the queen bee becomes infected then her control of the hive is also affected.

The study examined the contamination of pollen collected from foraging bees in a number of crop fields -- almond, apple, blueberry, cranberry, cucumber, pumpkin, and watermelon. Apples and cranberries had the widest diversity of pesticides found in the pollen. Pollen from the apple trees had an average of 14 different pesticide chemicals. The pollen from bees in the pumpkin crops had the highest loading of pesticides.

Each of the pesticides was fed to bees through pollen cakes and the bees were then exposed to nosema.

While 14 of the pesticides reduced the risk of the bees succumbing to nosema, 8 of the pesticides increased the risk of infection. Of real interest were 2 of the fungicides that led to increased infection: DMPF [dimethylphenyl formamide] and fluvalinate doubled the risk of infection. They are used by beekeepers to control hive mites.

In the discussion the researcher noted, "2 fungicides (chlorothalonil and pyraclostrobin), and 2 miticides used by beekeepers to control varroa infestation (amitraz and fluvalinate) had a pronounced effect on bees' ability to withstand parasite infection."

The pesticide with the highest relative risk was the fungicide pyraclostrobin. Bees that consumed pollen containing pyraclostrobin were almost 3 times more likely than bees consuming pollen without this chemical to become infected after nosema exposure.

The research also showed that DMPF used by beekeepers in controlling varroa mites also has a high risk of making bees susceptible to nosema. They note that the increasing practice of rotating combs in hives can help to cut the cumulative effect of pesticides and miticides on hives.

While most research on bees and pesticides tends to concentrate on insecticides and herbicides, this new study looking at the impact of fungicides -- possibly one of the 1st -- shows that there is still much to learn about the impact of chemicals on pollinator insects such as bees.

Much more research is needed and priority needs to be given to finding supporting evidence to confirm if fungicide application of bee hives to combat one parasite is increasing the susceptibility of the hive to an attack by another parasite.

[Recent research (see ProMED-mail posting 20120330.1085129) suggested that pesticides were linked to the bee's colony collapse disorder. This interesting finding lends further evidence for the role of pesticides.
