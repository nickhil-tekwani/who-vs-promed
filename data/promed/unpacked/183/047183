Foot and mouth disease in Argentina
-----------------------------------------
(Date of previous outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Argentina
reported to the OIE: August 2003).
Translation of information received on 8 Feb 2006 from Dr. Jorge
Nestor Amaya, President, National Agrifood Health and Quality Service
(SENASA), Secretariat for Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries and Food,
Buenos Aires:
Report date: 8 Feb 2006.
An outbreak of foot and mouth disease (FMD) virus serotype O was
reported in extensively farmed livestock (establishment with a
surface area of 6000 hectares) in San Luis del Palmar, province of
Corrientes (27o 30' 24.2" S - 58o 22' 59.6" W).
Date of 1st confirmation of the event: 8 Feb 2006.
Date of start of the event: 5 Feb 2006. This is the date of the
official intervention after notification was received. Judging by
observations at the farm (lesions and clinical signs) and by the
preliminary investigations (anamnesis), the event probably started on
26 Jan 2006.
Total number of susceptible animals in the outbreak: 3012 head of
cattle, 30 sheep and 25 goats.
Total number of cases: 70 head of cattle.
Total number of deaths: 0.
Source of outbreak or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive.
The corresponding epidemiological investigations are being carried
out, with tracing, inspection and sampling of farms with which there
have been animal movements, in order to investigate the origin and
probable spread.
Control measures
A. Undertaken:
- quarantine;
- movement control inside the country;
- vaccination using inactivated oil vaccine (polyvalent serotypes O,
A and C) (Note: As the 1st FMD vaccination campaign of 2006 in the
province of Corrientes started on 1 Feb 2006, priority will be given
to the affected area, primarily by vaccinating all susceptible
species in the perifocal area);
- disinfection of infected premises/establishment.
B. To be undertaken:
- stamping out;
- screening;
- zoning.

[San Luis del Palmar is about 200 km east southeast of Corrientes in
the northeast of Argentina. Obviously, there are questions about how
it got there from Brazil, as that is the most likely source. Clearly
though, the most important issue is how to stamp this outbreak out
before a very costly vaccination campaign is again necessary. -

Country and date: Argentina.; 8 Feb 2006
Type: Official
Issue: Follow-up: outbreak reported in Corrientes
Summary: FMD was suspected and reported by a private veterinarian
last Sat 4 Feb 2006 in a herd located in San Luis county, Corrientes
province, in the northeastern region of the country. There were 3067
susceptible in the herd, and 70 of them showed FMD-like clinical
signs. All the affected animals were Bradford cattle between 18 and
24 months old.
The herd was inspected by official veterinarians on Sunday and Monday
[5-6 Feb 2006], and all movements from herds in San Luis county to
the rest of the country were banned. Neighboring herds were inspected
by the veterinary service, and suspects of FMD were not found. Today
[8 Feb 2006], the national reference laboratory confirmed the
infection by FMD virus serotype O. All the movements in the region
will be traced back in an attempt to detect the origin of the
infection. Official notification was submitted to OIE, neighboring
countries, and regions and countries that keep a commercial relation
with Argentina. The vaccination campaign, which started in February
2006 in Corrientes, will be accelerated, and the animals in the herd
will be sacrificed.

[This is an interesting disease pattern when one considers that San
Luis del Palmar is about 200 km east by southeast of Corrientes in
the northeastern region of Argentina.
How the disease arrived there can only be speculated upon at this
point. Clearly, it was animal movement or movement of a contaminated
product, maybe someone taking the disease home on dirty boots.
Perhaps it came in on a riverboat.
After the recent OIE announcement that Argentina was at last
FMD-free, this is indeed a terrible blow. - Mod.TG]
