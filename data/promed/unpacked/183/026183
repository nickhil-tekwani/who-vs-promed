Did the veterinarians or caretakers check for MCF (Malignant Catarrhal
Fever) Virus in the blood of the living animals? The symptoms seem
familiar, perhaps similar to a rare outbreak in American bison 1997 in a
wildlife facility in Indiana, USA. The vets had a hard time in finding the
cause for weeks. Sheep, used for grazing around the perimeter fence of the
bison enclosure, were the silent vectors NOT showing ANY symptoms. ALL were
positive. In a few weeks six adult bison out of a herd of seventeen were
deceased. No cures or vaccines are known. Nor is the way of transmission
known.
MCF Information:
Malignant Catarrhal Fever: White-tailed Deer, Bison.
There are two different forms of this disease. The African form of MCF is
associated with African ungulates (wildebeest) in the wild and in zoos and
is caused by an Alcelaphine herpesvirus. The other is caused by an
uncharacterized herpesvirus carried by domestic sheep and is the usual
cause of MCF in cattle and in captive deer and bison in North America.
Cause: Poorly characterized herpesvirus of domestic sheep
Distribution: Wherever sheep are found
Epidemiology: Close contact with sheep is the usual common factor,
especially during lambing. Direct transmission from sheep to other species
is assumed. Most, if not all, occurrences in bison and White tailed deer
have been in captive/farmed animals
Gross Lesions:
In deer - often minimal gross lesions, acute death without much clinical
disease. In bison - parallels disease and lesions in cattle, - Underlying
pathology: arteritis, especially of small muscular arteries, usually
lymphocytic and most pronounced in the adventitia, sometimes with fibrinoid
necrosis of the arterial wall.
White-tailed Deer:
- Serosal hemorrhage: petechial
- ecchymotic, acute hemorrhages.
- Necrosis of oral mucosa: multifocal, acute, ulcerating
- Hepatitis: multifocal, acute, severe
Bison:
- Necrosis of alimentary tract mucosa (oral, esophageal, ruminal,
abomasal): multiple, acute or subacute, ulcerating Corneal edema

in reply to Gregory Glass
[The above response is from the Mammal-L, a mailing list for mammalogist,
including a large number of animal park/zoo researchers. Thanks to Gregory
Glass for passing on our posting. Thanks to Gabriel Grunert for a nice
update on MCF. From the limited information available from China, it is
impossible to comment on what the veterinarians are checking for with
regard to the giraffes. Although this post deals mostly with sheep, bison
and white tail deer, there may be similarities between these species and
the giraffes. Since giraffes are not studied as much as other species, they
may present a little differently than species with which we are more
familiar. Nevertheless, it is good suggestion and a good review. - Mod.TG
