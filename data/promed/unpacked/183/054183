The Junta de Castilla y Leon, through the General Directorate of Public Health and its Epidemiology Service, has confirmed a case of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in the province of Salamanca.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is caused by a virus, the main transmission mechanism of which is the bite of the tick of the genus _Hyalomma_ , although it can also be transmitted from person to person through contact with the patient's blood or fluids, which can occur especially in health personnel when they are not properly protected.

The case is a 59 year old man who, with symptoms compatible with CCHF, his occupation as a farmer, contact with animals and recent tick bites, was investigated appropriately and found to have Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, confirmed by the 'Carlos III' Health Institute.

The patient has been hospitalized for several days in the Infectious Diseases Service in a room with the isolation measures provided in these cases and his clinical condition is stable.

As soon as this possible case was suspected, clinical services coordinated activities with public health, using a protocol between the health authorities of the Ministry of Health and the Autonomous Community of Castilla y Leon. Blood samples from the patient were sent to the National Microbiology Center and the appropriate protection measures for health professionals were adopted.

Likewise, the Epidemiology Section of the Territorial Health Service of the Junta de Castilla y Leon, in collaboration with the health professionals of the Salamanca University Assistance Complex, has identified the contacts of the affected person to indicate the follow-up to be carried out, consisting of periodical monitoring of body temperature and the reporting of any health changes.

The General Directorate of Public Health of the Junta de Castilla y Leon maintains information available to the population and health care professionals at risk, to avoid new infections as far as possible.

Regarding the prevention of tick bites, the health authorities emphasise the importance of wearing appropriate clothing and footwear during field trips, as well as traveling on the roads and using repellants for both people and pets. They also insist that the ticks that may have been fixed must be removed as soon as possible, in an appropriate way, preferably by health professionals.

[Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is considered an emerging or even a probable re-emerging pathogen in southern Europe. Presence of this virus had been reported previously in various regions of Spain with a case report from the same region in June 2020 https://www.hps.scot.nhs.uk/publications/hps-weekly-report/volume-54/issue-25/cchf-in-salamanca-spain/.

Evidence of the virus circulation in Castile-Leon province in western Spain has been reported by Arteagaand colleagues in a 2017-2018 study with CCHFV seroprevalence of between 0.58% and 1.16% in healthy people https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.10.1900507.

Transmission potential of CCHF in potential hot spots can be reduced by timely identification of the disease and implementation of barrier-protection and patient-isolation practices. The risk of further human-to-human transmission in hospital settings can be significantly reduced by applying timely appropriate infection prevention and control measures.

Furthermore, enhanced awareness of the importance of early diagnosis and laboratory confirmation should be emphasized among health care providers in areas with potential circulation of CCHF virus. Standard precautions, preferably combined with contact and droplet precautionary measures, should be taken when caring for patients presenting with haemorrhagic fever syndrome. Laboratory tests on patient samples present a high risk of transmission and should only be conducted under appropriate biological containment conditions. - Mod.UBA
