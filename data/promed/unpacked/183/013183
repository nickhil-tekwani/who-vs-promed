Authorities say the fungus that causes a bat-killing disease has been detected in Nebraska. The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission said [Thu 12 Nov 2015] in a news release that samples were collected earlier this year [2015] from bats hibernating in a mine in eastern Nebraska's Cass County. The fungus presence was confirmed by researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

The fungus causes what's known as white nose syndrome, which experts say has killed more than 6 million bats in North America since it was first found in New York in [2006].

Zoologist Mike Fritz says that although the fungus has been found in Nebraska, the disease has not yet been found in any bats in the state. Studies say insect control by bats is worth billions of dollars annually to agriculture.

[The state of Nebraska can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=3790442,1792. Cass County can be seen on the map at http://geology.com/county-map/nebraska-county-map.gif.
The map at https://www.whitenosesyndrome.org/resources/map, showing the occurrence of bat white nose syndrome (WNS) by county/district, and updated 12 Nov 2015, reflects the detection of the fungus causing WNS in Cass County, Nebraska.

It is sad to learn this disease is continuing a slow march westward across the United States.

White nose syndrome is a disease affecting hibernating bats. Named for the white fungus that appears on the muzzle and other parts of hibernating bats, WNS is associated with extensive mortality of bats in eastern North America. First documented in New York in the winter of 2006-2007, WNS has spread rapidly across the eastern United States and Canada, and the fungus that causes WNS has been detected as far south as Mississippi.

Bats with WNS act strangely during cold winter months, including flying outside in the day and clustering near the entrances of hibernacula (caves and mines where bats hibernate). Bats have been found sick and dying in unprecedented numbers in and around caves and mines. WNS has killed more than 5.7 million bats in eastern North America. In some hibernacula, 90 to 100 percent of bats have died.

Many laboratories and state and federal biologists are investigating the cause of the bat deaths. A newly discovered fungus, _Pseudogymnoascus destructans_, or pd, (formerly _Geomyces destructans_), has been demonstrated to cause WNS. Scientists are investigating the dynamics of fungal infection and transmission, and searching for a way to control it.
