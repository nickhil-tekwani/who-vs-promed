[No further information on the additional human case (sex and age not
stated) reported by New York State on 1 Dec 2000 is given in the current
Update. The number of human cases in New York State remains at 14 (Brooklyn
2, Manhattan 1, Queens 1, Staten Island 10). The US Department of
Agriculture Report has been updated to cover the period up to Fri 1 Dec
2000. One additional county, Erie in Pennsylvania, reported 2 West Nile
virus positive mosquito pools. This is the farthest west that West Nile
virus positive mosquito pools have ever been found in the United States. -

This week, the New York State Health Department's Wadsworth Center
laboratories reported one new West Nile virus positive mosquito pool case
in Nassau County.
Note: This text report and the New York State summary map reports West Nile
virus positive results. Encephalitis or severe neurologic symptoms were not
present in all of the human, bird, and mammal positive "cases". A number of
the birds and mammals had no clinical signs of West Nile infection at all;
they were asymptomatic surveillance specimens.
The total number of West Nile virus positive specimens from New York State
for this year is 1271 dead birds, 358 mosquito pools, 2 sentinel chickens,
8 live wild birds, 14 bats, 24 horses, 2 cats, 2 raccoons, 3 domestic
rabbits, 3 squirrels, one chipmunk, and 14 human cases.
The New York State Map of West Nile virus positive results has been updated
to cover the period 1 Jan 2000 through 8 Dec 2000

[I West Nile virus positive results for the period 1 Nov 2000 through 1
Dec 2000:
Equine cases
There were 4 additional equine clinical cases of West Nile virus (WNV)
infection confirmed during the period. This brings to 57 the total number
of equine cases of WNV infection in 2000, of which 34 survived and 23 (40%)
died or were euthanatized. The National Veterinary Services Laboratories
(NVSL) found all 4 of the horses to be WNV-positive on a 1:1000 dilution
(or greater) of serum on IgM-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA). All also had WNV-positive results on a 1:10 dilution (greater) of
serum on a plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT).

Note: A total of 8 additional equine cases of WNV infection have been
reported by the States of New Jersey (1) and New York (7) for the year
2000. To date, these cases have not been classified as confirmed or
probable WNV infections by USDA-APHIS for one of the following reasons: 1)
specimens provided to NVSL have tested negative for WNV; 2) inadequate
specimens have been provided to NVSL for confirmatory testing; 3)
information provided on animal history and/or animal identification has so
far been inadequate to differentiate clinical cases from subclinical
infections or to conclusively distinguish one animal from another.
The European Union previously issued import restrictions for horses
originating from 6 States with equine cases of WNV (Connecticut,
Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island). The
restrictions were scheduled to be in effect until 30 Nov 2000.
Human cases
One new human case of WNV infection was reported from New York County
(Manhattan), New York. No details of this case have yet been reported, but
it is very likely that the clinical onset was well before 1 Nov 2000. The
total number of human cases for the year 2000 is now 19, including one death.
There were no other mammals reported as WNV-positive during the period.
Wild Birds
Another 279 birds were reported as positive for WNV, although most were
collected in earlier months and tested only recently. The first
WNV-positive bird in Delaware, a great horned owl, was detected in Kent
County. The live owl was positive for WNV neutralizing antibodies,
indicating a past infection with WNV. Over 4300 birds have now been
documented as infected with WNV in 12 States plus the District of Columbia
in the year 2000.
Sentinel birds
There were 6 new sentinel birds confirmed as WNV-positive in New Jersey.
Positive blood samples were collected from all 6 in late October. The total
number of sentinel chickens found WNV-positive in 2000 is now 12.
Mosquito pools
One additional county, Erie in Pennsylvania, reported 2 WNV-positive
mosquito pools. This is the farthest west that WNV-positive mosquito pools
have ever been found in the United States. A total of 33 new positive
mosquito pools were reported overall, bringing the total for the year to 478.
Associations
A total of 143 counties in 12 States and the District of Columbia have had
confirmed findings of WNV in a mosquito, bird, or mammal, since 1 May 2000:
Connecticut (8), Delaware (2), District of Columbia (1), Maryland (8),
Massachusetts (11), New Hampshire (2), New Jersey (20), New York (61),
North Carolina (1), Pennsylvania (17), Rhode Island (4), Vermont (1), and
Virginia (7).
In total 133 counties have detected at least one positive bird, and 109
counties in 8 States and the District of Columbia have reported 2 or more
confirmed findings of WNV-positive birds: Connecticut (8), District of
Columbia (1), Maryland (6), Massachusetts (8), New Hampshire (2), New
Jersey (17), New York (56), Pennsylvania (7), and Rhode Island (4).
Sussex County, New Jersey, has had WNV-positive horses (3), mosquito pools
(6), and a sentinel chicken, but no WNV-positive wild birds detected.
Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, has had a WNV-positive horse and mosquito
pools (2), but no WNV-positive wild birds detected.
29 counties in 5 States have now had at least one wild bird and at least
one mosquito pool reported as positive: Connecticut (Fairfield, New Haven),
Massachusetts (Norfolk, Suffolk), New Jersey (Bergen, Essex, Hunterdon,
Middlesex, Monmouth, Ocean, Passaic, Union), New York (Bronx, Columbia,
Kings, Nassau, New York, Orange, Queens, Richmond, Rockland, Suffolk,
Westchester), and Pennsylvania (Chester, Cumberland, Lehigh, Montgomery,
Philadelphia City, York).
[II Summary of all WNV-positive findings for the year 2000 (1 May through
1 Dec):
Summary of all WNV-positive findings for the period 1 May 2000 through 1
Dec 2000:
57 equine cases; 19 human cases; 26 other mammals; 4324 wild birds; 478
mosquito pools; 12 sentinel birds. [In the USDA Report these totals are
subdivided by county, species, sex and location, where appropriate.
