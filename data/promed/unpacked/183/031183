Enteroviruses are common viruses associated with diverse clinical syndromes,
ranging from minor febrile illness to severe, potentially fatal conditions
(e.g., aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, paralysis, myocarditis, and neonatal
enteroviral sepsis) (1,2). A total of 68 enterovirus serotypes are recognized,
including 65 non-polio enteroviruses (1,2). Individual serotypes have
different temporal patterns of circulation and can be associated with
different clinical manifestations (2,3). This report describes trends in
reported enterovirus infections in the United States during 2002 to 2004,
including widespread circulation of 2 serotypes, echovirus 9 and echovirus 30,
commonly associated with aseptic meningitis outbreaks.
Monitoring circulating enteroviruses helped identify these 2 serotypes as
primary causes of aseptic meningitis outbreaks in 2003 (4). Increased state
laboratory participation and timely reporting by all laboratories to CDC would
further increase the public health utility of enterovirus surveillance.
Other than paralytic poliomyelitis, diseases associated with enterovirus
infections are not nationally notifiable in the United States. To help public
health officials recognize and control outbreaks of enteroviral disease, the
National Enterovirus Surveillance System (NESS) monitors temporal and
geographic trends in circulating enteroviruses in the United States.
Enterovirus detections, characterized by serotype, specimen type, collection
date, and basic demographic information, are reported monthly to CDC by
participating laboratories. NESS is a voluntary, passive surveillance system,
and the number of participating state laboratories varies from year to year.
During the period 2002 to 2004, a total of 24 laboratories, including 22
public health laboratories, one private laboratory, and the CDC Enterovirus
Laboratory, reported 4123 enterovirus detections in 46 states and Puerto Rico
[illustrated by a map in the original text].
21 states reported results directly from state public health laboratories,
whereas 25 states and Puerto Rico reported results indirectly, either through
the private laboratory or the CDC Enterovirus Laboratory. Four states and the
District of Columbia did not report any enterovirus detections to NESS. 7
laboratories, an increase from 3 during the period 2000 to 2001, used genomic
sequencing for enterovirus typing; 17 laboratories used traditional antigenic
methods of serotype detection (neutralization reaction or immunofluorescence
assay). Enterovirus serotype was identified in 3630 (88 percent) reports and
was unknown for 493 (12 percent) reports [Tabulated in the in the original
text.]
The 2 predominant enteroviruses, echoviruses 9 and 30, accounted for more than
half of all enterovirus detections in the United States during the period 2002
to 2004 [Tabulated in the original text]. Echovirus 9 accounted for 21.5,
41.0, and 18.9 percent of detections with known serotypes during 2002, 2003,
and 2004, respectively. Echovirus 30 was uncommon in 2002 (3.3 percent) but
accounted for 32.4 percent of reports with known serotypes in 2003 and 40.3
percent in 2004. Echovirus 7 was the most common enterovirus in 2002 (22.5
percent of reports with known serotypes) but rarely was reported in 2003 and
2004. Coxsackievirus B1 was the 3rd most commonly reported enterovirus in 2002
and 2003 (10.8 and 4.6 percent, respectively), and coxsackievirus A9 was the
3rd most common serotype (6.9 percent) in 2004. Other non-polio enteroviruses
were reported infrequently, and no polioviruses were reported. During the
period 2002 to 2004, echovirus 9 was detected in 41 states and Puerto !
Rico, echovirus 30 in 38 states and Puerto Rico, and echovirus 7 in 24 states.
Three states (Georgia, Illinois, and New York) accounted for 528 (47.8
percent) of the echovirus 9 detections. The majority (536 [50.7 percent]) of
echovirus 30 detections were from Arizona, Florida, and Texas, and more than
half of echovirus 7 detections (98 [54.0 percent]) were from Minnesota and
Texas.
Cerebrospinal fluid was the most common source for enterovirus detection (2483
[63.1 [percent] of 3932 reports with known specimen type), followed by
respiratory specimens (562 [14.3 percent]) and stool or rectal-swab specimens
(517 [13.1 percent]). The age of source patients ranged from less than 1 month
to 95 years (median: 7 years). Children aged less than 1 year accounted for
953 (27.4 percent) of 3481 enterovirus detections for which age of source
patient was known. Consistent with the established summer-fall seasonality of
enterovirus circulation (2,3), the majority of enterovirus detections (2983)
[72.5 percent] of 4115 records for which month of specimen collection was
known) were reported during June to October of 2002, 2003, and 2004.

MMWR Editorial Note
-------------------
Monitoring circulating enteroviruses is important because individual serotypes
have different temporal patterns of circulation and the changes in predominant
serotypes can be accompanied by large-scale outbreaks of enteroviral illnesses
(3). Serotype-based enterovirus surveillance in the United States has 5
objectives. First, NESS data help public health practitioners determine long-
term patterns of circulation for individual enteroviruses (3). Second, the
data are used for interpreting trends in enteroviral diseases, such as aseptic
meningitis, by associating them with circulating serotypes (5) and can be
helpful for studying the association of enteroviruses with clinical
manifestations (e.g., chronic diseases such as diabetes) (2). Third, the data
are used to guide outbreak investigations by enabling linkage of disease
clusters; diagnosis by serologic assay and clinical presentation, which varies
by serotype; and timelier laboratory identification. Fourth, because
susceptibi!
lity to candidate anti-enterovirus drugs varies by serotype (6), information
on circulating serotypes helps guide development of new diagnostic tests and
therapies. Finally, NESS monitors poliovirus detections, thereby supplementing
poliovirus surveillance in the United States.
The findings of this report are consistent with previous observations
regarding temporal variability of predominant enterovirus serotypes (3).
Although the predominant serotypes change, certain enteroviruses appear
consistently among those most commonly detected each year. Of the 15 most
common serotypes detected during 2002-2004, 7 (echoviruses 6, 9, 11, and 30
and coxsackieviruses A9, B2, and B4) have been among the 15 most common
enteroviruses detected each year since 1993 (7-9).
During the period 2002 to 2004, echoviruses 9 and 30 became the predominant
serotypes, whereas echoviruses 18 and 13, which prevailed in 2001 (9), were
detected rarely. Echoviruses 9 and 30 usually have an epidemic pattern of
circulation, with periods of high activity followed by several years of
relative quiescence (3). Before 2002, echovirus 9 had not been the predominant
enterovirus since 1995, when it accounted for 45.1 percent of reported
enterovirus detections, and echovirus 30 had not been widespread since 1998,
when it accounted for 45.9 percent of reported detections (7-9). The
identification of echoviruses 9 and 30 by NESS as the two most prevalent
enterovirus serotypes helped guide investigations of multiple outbreaks of
aseptic meningitis in the United States in 2003, all of which were
subsequently linked to these serotypes (4). The occurrence of these outbreaks
was consistent with the previously noted coincidence of the high activity of
echoviruses 9 and 30 (as reported to NESS) with peaks in hospitalizations for
aseptic meningitis in the United States (5).
Echovirus 7 was the most common serotype for the first time in 2002. Small
peaks of echovirus 7 activity were observed in 1979, in the mid-1980s, and in
1997, but the serotype has been detected infrequently at other times (7-9;
CDC, unpublished data, 1971-2005).
Beginning in 2003, the proportion of reports with unknown serotypes decreased
to under 10 percent, compared with 18-20 percent during 2000 to 2002. This
decrease likely was associated with an increase in the number of laboratories
using molecular techniques to detect enteroviruses. Enterovirus typing by
genomic sequencing of the capsid viral protein 1 (VP1) gene (which correlates
with enterovirus serotype) allows rapid and reliable identification of any
enterovirus, including those for which the reagents used in traditional
antigen-based typing methods are not readily available (10). The use of this
approach has led to recent identification of several previously unknown
enterovirus serotypes (1).
The findings in this report are subject to at least 2 limitations. First,
enteroviruses that commonly infect younger patients or that are associated
with more severe illnesses might be over-represented in NESS because clinical
specimens from young children and more severely ill patients are submitted for
testing more frequently. Second, because of the voluntary and passive nature
of reporting to NESS, the decreasing number of participating laboratories
(from 27 during 2000-2001 to 24 during 2002-2004), the small numbers of
reports from certain states, and the absence of reports from others, these
results might not be representative of enterovirus circulation in the entire
United States.
The geographic representation of the states reporting enterovirus detections
increased from 44 states during 2000-2001 to 46 states and Puerto Rico during
2002-2004. This trend toward increased geographic representation began in
2000, when the CDC Enterovirus Laboratory and a private laboratory, both of
which receive specimens from multiple states, began reporting directly to
NESS. Future enterovirus surveillance would benefit from increased laboratory
participation, especially by state public health laboratories. Heightened
awareness of the importance of enterovirus surveillance and knowledge about
the deficiency in reporting might increase reporting by state laboratories.

[This report makes the important point that the introduction of enterovirus
typing by genomic sequencing of the capsid viral protein 1 (VP1) gene (which
correlates with enterovirus serotype) allows rapid and reliable identification
of any enterovirus, including those for which the reagents used in traditional
antigen-based typing methods are not readily available. The use of this
approach has led to recent identification of several previously unknown
enterovirus serotypes, and in future will contribute to the identification of
newly emergent diseases associated with specific enterovirus serotypes.
The genus _Enterovirus_ of the family _Picornaviridae_ comprises an assemblage
of serologically distinct viruses, variously designated as enteroviruses,
coxsackieviruses, polioviruses and echoviruses. The majority (29) of the 68
serologically distinct enteroviruses (see reference 1) have been designated
echoviruses (Enteric Cytopathic Orphan Viruses) because of apparent lack of
association with disease. It is now apparent as a consequence of enhanced
surveillance of enteroviruses that some of these viruses do have specific
associations with disease. For example, as reported above, peaks of occurrence
of echoviruses 9 and 30 have been coincident with peaks in hospitalizations
for aseptic meningitis in the United States. It is likely, therefore, that
enhanced surveillance employing genomic sequencing will reveal novel disease
associations and contribute to the prediction and control of epidemic
disease. - Mod.CP]
