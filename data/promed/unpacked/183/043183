Saudi Health Ministry reports 20 swine flu cases among Hajj pilgrims
--------------------------------------------------------------------
So far 20 swine flu [influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection]
cases have been reported among foreign Hajj pilgrims since they
started arriving for this year's [2009] pilgrimage, health minister
Dr Abdullah Al-Rabeeah said at a press conference in Jeddah on
Thursday [19 Nov 2009]. Al-Rabeeah said the Ministry has ensured
adequate supplies of medicine to treat the disease, and this includes
1.5 million doses of the H1N1 vaccine for pilgrims.

On Thursday [19 Nov 2009] he held a meeting with top officials to
review the Ministry's preparations to meet pilgrims' health needs. He
said the Ministry had taken every precaution to protect pilgrims
against swine flu and other contagious diseases. "We have also
installed the Biomimetic and Cognitive Robotics (BCR) laboratory to
detect swine flu," he said.

He said BCR tests are available at Mina Hospital, in addition to the
3 high-tech labs in Makkah (Mecca). He stressed that the Ministry is
able to contain the flu because of its intensive effort in
coordination with the World Health Organization.

The Ministry of Health has set up 14 hospitals in Makkah with 2782
beds. Besides these facilities, these hospitals are equipped with 244
beds in intensive care units and 287 emergency beds. There are 35
permanent health centers in Makkah, 9 seasonal health centers along
the Makkah-Madinah Expressway, and 4 centers inside the Grand Mosque
in Makkah. 28 health centers will operate in Mina, 46 in Arafat, and
6 in Muzdalifah. The ministry has deployed 10 000 health workers
including 100 doctors, 60 of them foreign specialists in infectious
diseases, and 147 foreign nurses for intensive care units and
emergency centers.

The UAE [United Arab Emirates] Ministry of Health has designated 4
locations in Dubai and another 30 across the country for vaccinating
pilgrims and completion of other medical checkups needed for Hajj.
All UAE pilgrims will obtain the yellow health international
vaccination certificate once they have received the swine flu
vaccination. The certificate also proves all other vaccinations
required for Hajj have been administered, in accordance with Saudi
requirements.
