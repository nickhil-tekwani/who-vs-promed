Scientists and global health officials are investigating whether the current Ebola outbreak in Guinea may have been triggered by a person who was first infected with the virus during the Ebola epidemic in the region 5 years ago.

The World Health Organization (WHO) is carrying out further investigations into the individual who appears to have had the virus lay dormant in their body.

This would suggest infections may persist once people recover and have the potential to start a future outbreak.

Countries in West Africa on high alert after Ebola outbreak in Guinea

International researchers, including a team at the University of Conakry in Guinea, sequenced the genome of 9 samples taken from people infected during the current outbreak and compared them against sequences from previous outbreaks to help identify the cause.

The results suggest the latest outbreak "is the result of the resurgence of a strain that previously circulated in the West African outbreak," the authors wrote in their analysis.

The team found that the strain of the Ebola virus circulating resembled that of the [Makona] variant, responsible for the large-scale 2014-2016 outbreak in West Africa.

"The similarities are big enough for us to declare that this is the same family of the virus," says Dr Salam Gueye, director of the Emergency Preparedness and Response Cluster at the WHO Regional Office for Africa.

But Dr Alpha Keita, Deputy Director of the Centre de Recherche et de Formation en Infectiologie de Guinee (CERFIG) at the University of Conakry, who led the research, said his team have refrained from making any hasty conclusions.

They decided to be extremely careful and continue sequencing on additional samples to obtain more complete sequences that will provide a safer answer, he added.

In a separate report about the work, Keita explained that the implications in terms of public health and the safety of people, such as the risks of stigmatization, physical and verbal violence among previous Ebola survivors, called for such an approach.

Gueye said further investigations are now underway to see what exactly happened.

Guinea's Ministry of Health declared a new outbreak of Ebola virus disease in the country's Nzerekore region on [14 Feb 2021]. As of [25 Mar 2021], 18 cases have been reported, including 14 confirmed and 4 probable cases. 9 people have died and 366 contacts are being followed up.

The latest outbreak started just 200 km [124 mi] from the epicenter of the previous epidemic, according to the researchers.

A sexually transmitted virus?
The 1st case in the current outbreak, identified in the sub-county of Goueke, was a nurse who died at the end of January 2021. All other cases are people who attended the funeral on [1 Feb 2021], according to Gueye.

The nurse was an in-law to the spouse of the survivor who is thought to have carried the virus for 5 years. The spouse subsequently died of Ebola virus disease, the nurse soon developed the disease, and is believed to have transmitted it to other people during the funeral. "That is how the outbreak may have started," said Gueye.

Teams at CERFIG then sequenced the 9 samples from people testing positive for Ebola, with the [Makona] variant identified in these samples.

The virus may have been latent and subsequently sexually transmitted from one person to another or the virus was present in the body and not causing illness, but due to virus mutation or host immunity going down it caused a relapse, Gueye told CNN.

Semen has been found to contain traces of Ebola virus long after a person was declared free of the disease.

"We are continuing to do epidemiological and anthropological investigations in order to reinforce that hypothesis or exclude it but so far that is the strongest hypothesis we have," said Gueye.

Ebola fast facts
----------------
Wim Van Damme, a researcher and infectious disease expert at the Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp, who was not involved in the research, cautions that this method of transmission would be a very rare event. "There are more than 10 000 Ebola survivors in West Africa, and this is the 1st case, after 5 years," he said.

He added that while many people think the infection was most probably a case of sexual transmission. "That is not for sure because the virus can remain present in other places in the body (mainly in the central nervous system)." But he explains that it's also unknown how the virus would spread from the nervous system to another human being.

"We need to do supplemental investigations and epidemiological research in order to determine what happened and to have a strong hypothesis on it. There are a lot of facts that have given us enough information for us to react," Gueye told CNN.

Health workers from the Guinean Ministry of Health prepare forms to register medical staff ahead of their anti-Ebola vaccines at the Nzerekore Hospital.

The WHO is working with the West African affected governments and a task force has been formed. "The task force will further go into epidemiology, bioinformatics, and laboratory to see what we can learn from this experience and translate it into the program," said Gueye.

The risk of future outbreaks
"The fact is that we need to follow up these survivors for prolonged periods of time with frequent semen analysis for the virus. We can also provide condoms for them," said Dr Merawi Aragaw, Incident Manager for Ebola, Africa CDC.

"The community needs continuous education. We are trying to reach the community through health workers they can trust," said Aragaw, adding that the Africa CDC continuously give survivors psychological support and advise partners and people in the community.

The WHO says it will strengthen surveillance, disease detection, and disease responses for countries affected by Ebola.

"It will change the way we are responding to Ebola and the way we are preventing Ebola. It is a disease that needs to be in the surveillance system and it needs collaboration of the community, the health workers, and also it needs to be a priority for the health authorities," Gueye said.

Ebola virus disease (EVD) is a rare but severe, often fatal illness in humans. The virus typically spreads through direct contact with the blood, body fluids, or tissues of infected people or animals.

The 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic in West Africa was the largest to date, spreading to Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea.

A total of 28 646 suspected cases were reported along with 11 323 deaths.

Secretary Antony J Blinken at high level meeting on response and resilience to Ebola -- Remarks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As prepared for delivery

Thank you, Ambassador Lapenn.

Let me first thank all of our convening partners for this event. And I want to thank all of the participants here today -- from governments, multilateral organizations, civil society organizations, and the private sector - for the vital work you are doing on the Ebola response efforts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Guinea, and toward strengthening global health security more broadly.

I would ask that each of you who has teams on the front lines of this effort to please extend my personal gratitude on behalf of the United States to the doctors, nurses, community health workers, and others who are putting their lives on the line to help those affected and stop the spread of this virus. We recognize that their efforts not only help the people in Guinea and the DRC but all of us. We are humbled by their bravery and service.

As this group understands, the enduring goal in preparing for health emergencies is to invest in the systems and tools we need to detect outbreaks and respond to them swiftly and effectively.

Our track record on this is far from perfect, as the 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic and the current COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated.

Yet thanks to our collective efforts, we have made great strides in responding to the 2021 Ebola resurgence in Guinea and the DRC. Outbreaks were detected early, and the Guinean and Congolese governments moved swiftly to stop their spread. International and regional organizations mobilized support for the response. Guinea and the DRC communicated rapidly with neighboring countries and began coordinating their efforts. NGOs stepped up their efforts.

And it's worth noting that all of this has been done while simultaneously responding to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and other diseases such as yellow fever, polio, and malaria.

As a result, it's been approximately 20 days since the last Ebola case in either country. A number of people have lost their lives in these outbreaks, and we mourn their losses. But we also recognize how many lives have been saved as a result of the response to date.

This would not have been possible if it weren't for the investments that we've all made in preparedness and resilience, from strengthening disease surveillance to developing effective Ebola vaccines and treatments.

And past outbreaks taught us hard lessons, which we've worked to address in our response to this outbreak. One is the importance of establishing a single, streamlined response structure and coordinating the range of institutions involved in the response. Another is the critical importance of engaging local communities from the outset - in their own languages and through their own leaders -- because that's the best way to get the right information out there and combat misinformation and rumors.

For example, when the 2021 outbreak started in Guinea, USAID provided USD 800 000 to Breakthrough ACTION -- a program run by Johns Hopkins University -- to support the Guinean Government's efforts to reach communities at the grassroots level. Breakthrough ACTION developed prevention and awareness messaging in local languages, which was then disseminated on local radio stations; they trained and deployed community mobilizers, who have visited more than 1300 households in the affected areas; and they engaged Christian and Muslim leaders, traditional practitioners, and youth leaders to disseminate accurate information.

But we can't be complacent. All of us can and must continue to support efforts to bring the current Ebola outbreak to an end. To that end, I'm pleased to announce that today the United States has allocated up to USD 30 million in assistance to support the governments of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Guinea in their ongoing responses, and to strengthen Ebola preparedness in 9 high-risk border countries. We're also deploying technical experts to the region to support the effort and extending support for the work of our humanitarian partners.

We also have to invest the time and resources in shoring up our global health security. Looking beyond Ebola, every country must deepen its capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to outbreaks, including the current COVID-19 pandemic.

And we have to improve our ability to work across borders and sectors to confront these health threats -- because as we've learned, this is an issue where our fates are bound up together. COVAX offers one example of how the international community is already doing this, by working together to expand equitable access to safe, effective COVID-19 vaccines. The United States has already contributed USD 2 billion to the effort, and we've recently pledged USD 2 billion more.

If we continue to work in this way -- deepening all nations' preparedness and resilience, supporting the countries battling outbreaks, and continuing to strengthen our global health security -- we will not only stop the current Ebola outbreaks, but we will make ourselves more resilient in the face of the inevitable disease outbreaks to come. Thank you.
