New outbreak of _Sarcocystis_ [infection] at Tioman Island, Malaysia
----------------------------------------------
In October 2011, GeoSentinel, the global surveillance program of the International Society of Travel Medicine (ISTM), detected an unusual cluster of _Sarcocystis_-related illness among 33 patients with travel to Tioman Island, Malaysia mostly during July/August 2011. Preliminary details were published (Notes from the Field: Acute Muscular Sarcocystosis Among Returning Travelers -- Tioman Island, Malaysia, 2011. Morb Mortal Wkly Rep (MMWR). January 20, 2012 / 61(02);37-38. Available at: http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6102a4.htm).

During the last few weeks, GeoSentinel has received new reports of similar summer 2012 travel-related cases including from our PRS-Paris (Eric Caumes and Alice Pérignon) and GVA-Geneva (Louis Loutan and Noémi Wagner) Sites.

A total of 5 French travelers were together in Malaysia, including Tioman Island, in early June. Three have been ill. When first seen on July 18, the index case, a 27 year old woman, reported exactly one month of asthenia, significant myalgia, abdominal pain, profuse diarrhea and vomiting. Eosinophilia peaked at 1410/mm3 on July 25 and CPK [creatine phosphokinase] at 600 U/L (Normal < 160 U/L) on August 4.

Because of initial concern over helminthiasis, empiric therapy with both ivermectin and albendazole was given. The brother of the index case above had eosinophilia of 1,500/mm3 and myalgias but normal CPK (though done 2 months after the trip). A 3rd traveler had only mild myalgia for a few days and never came to the clinic. A muscle biopsy on the index case has been confirmed as _Sarcocystis_ by Dr. Ronald Fayer at USDA after Dr. Thierry Maisonobe first identified the parasitic cysts at the PRS Site.

The GVA Site reports a 23-year-old patient who presented with fever for a total of 18 days, eosinophilia, CPK elevation (382 U/L), and important muscle fasciculations and myalgia after 3 months in Malaysia and Indonesia. Trichinella serology was negative. No biopsy was done but serum has been sent to CDC in Atlanta for serological testing.

To date, _Sarcocystis_-related illness has been characterized by unexplained fever, musculoskeletal pain, eosinophilia, and elevated serum creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) levels among patients exposed on Tioman Island, Malaysia. Most patients experienced onset of significant muscle and/or joint pain approximately 2-4 weeks after leaving the island. Eosinophilia or elevations of CPK typically occurred ~40 days post-departure.

Over 100 zoonotic _Sarcocystis_ species exist in many animals. In the recent outbreaks in Malaysia, humans have become accidental intermediate hosts for zoonotic species by ingesting fecally-contaminated material. The life cycle and definitive animal host are not known for any species of _Sarcocystis_ that forms sarcocysts in human muscle and a multi-national lab and epidemiologic investigation into this aspect is ongoing. Due to the rarity of human sarcocystosis, no human therapeutic data exist; by analogy with the tachyzoite stage of toxoplasmosis, TMP-SMX [trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole] possibly would be effective. Relevant national and international public health authorities have been informed of these new cases.

Please inform GeoSentinel (geosentinel@geosentinel.org) immediately of suspicious cases and for assistance with diagnosis.

[ProMED thanks David Freedman and Eric Chaumes for aleting ProMED to the new cases. It is a puzzle that the risk of infection is limited to a single Island. As the report comes from infected travellers it probably reflects that the island is a preferred tourist destination. Sarcocystis should also be investigated in the local population as well. - Mod.

[Tioman Island, with a population of 432 (as of the 2008 census) is a small island that is a tourist destination in the South China Sea located 32 km (20 miles) off the east coast of the Peninsular Malaysia in the state of Pahang; the island is about 39 km (24 miles) long and 12 km (7.5 miles) wide (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tioman_Island). The island is served by ferries from the Malaysian mainland, and plane service from Singapore and Kuala Lumpur. - Mod.ML
