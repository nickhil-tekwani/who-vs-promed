Health officials are appealing to parents to immunize their children after an "unrelenting mumps outbreak" hits Auckland.

An "unrelenting mumps outbreak" hitting Auckland has health officials appealing to parents to immunize their children.

More than 130 cases have been reported in the city this year [2017], compared with 35 in 2016, the Auckland Regional Public Health Service says.

In 80 percent of cases, the patient has not been fully vaccinated.

"It is disappointing because mumps is a preventable and serious disease," the service's clinical director Julia Peters said.

"Most recover from this disease. However in the last 6 months a number of people have suffered from severe complications."

This included some adolescent males who were treated in hospital for pain and swelling in their testicles, which in rare cases can result in infertility.

In other cases, some females experienced ovarian inflammation and another person developed meningitis.

Non-immune pregnant women who catch the disease risk miscarriage in the 1st 3 months. In rare cases, mumps can cause permanent hearing loss.

With almost 70 percent of this year's cases occurring in those aged between 10 and 19, Dr Peters urged parents to ensure their families' free measles mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccinations were up to date.

Mumps can spread quickly among those who are not immune, and one infected individual can cause an outbreak at a secondary school because immunity in that age group is well below the national average.

"We are in the midst of an outbreak and already many students are scrambling to catch up on school work after missing school for several weeks," Dr Peters said.

A total of 2 members of the Harvard University community have been diagnosed with mumps, according to an e-mail sent to Harvard students and staff.

The infections were confirmed [Thu 22 Jun 2017] and coincide with several other mumps diagnoses in the Boston area over the past month, Dr Paul J. Barreira, director of Harvard University Health Services, said in the e-mail.

Those infected by the virus were not identified, but one of them is connected to the Harvard Biolabs complex on Divinity Avenue in Cambridge, according to Leslie Kirwan, dean for administration and finance in Harvard's Faculty of Arts and Sciences.

Kirwan said in the e-mail that those who have recently been in the Biolabs facility should take special note of the alert.

[The Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) issued a health alert for a Boston area mumps outbreak on Mon 5 Jun, to healthcare providers and local boards of health. See [4] below.

From 1 Jan -- 17 Jun 2017, 44 states and the District of Columbia in the US reported mumps infections in 3562 people to CDC.

Mumps is no longer very common in the United States, but case numbers vary from year to year; mumps cases can range from roughly a couple hundred to a couple thousand. For example in 2016, there were approximately 5833 cases reported to CDC, and in 2012, there were 229. Before the U.S. mumps vaccination program started in 1967, about 186 000 cases were reported each year, but the actual number of cases was likely much higher due to under-reporting. Since the pre-vaccine era, there has been a more than 99 percent decrease in mumps cases in the United States.

Health officials confirmed on [Wed 5 Jul 20917] that a Dartmouth College student has a case of the mumps and has been placed in isolation. A statement said the school's health providers are working with state officials to manage and test students with potential symptoms of the disease.

Students are being asked to contact Dartmouth College Health Services about any health concerns, while staff members and faculty are advised to consult their primary care physicians, The Union Leader reported.

"We are writing to you today to provide you with information you will need to be an active part of the response to prevent the spread of mumps on campus," Dr Ann Bracken, director of clinical medical services at the college health service, told students via email.

As of [Thu 6 Jul 2017], no other students had been tested for mumps, which the college requires vaccination against in order to register for classes with the exception of those who are exempted under specific circumstances, The Leader Union reported.

Mumps may cause a patient to experience puffy cheeks, swollen jaw, fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, loss of appetite or swollen salivary glands. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), symptoms can appear 16--18 days after infection, or up to 25 days after. The virus is contagious and could cause life-threatening complications if left untreated.

The Massachusetts Department of Public Health says it will be reaching out to Latino communities in the state to increase awareness about the mumps virus, commonly spread through infected saliva, and to encourage vaccination against the potentially serious disease.

The Massachusetts Department of Public Health says it will be reaching out to Latino communities to increase awareness about the mumps virus, commonly spread through infected saliva, and to encourage vaccination against the potentially serious, highly infectious disease with the measles, mumps, and rubella [MMR] vaccine.

According to the DPH, 12 new cases of mumps have been diagnosed since the end of March [2017] in the commonwealth among Latino residents of Chelsea, Boston, and Revere. Those diagnosed range in age from 20 -- 41, may represent a change in the epidemiology of mumps in the state, which experienced a large outbreak last year [2016], as none has any known connection to higher education, according to the DPH.

To date, according to the DPH, the majority of confirmed and probable mumps cases in the commonwealth have been among vaccinated college students and others linked to colleges and universities.

It is believed most of the Latino individuals diagnosed since March [2017] have not been vaccinated, and none is known to have traveled internationally.

MMR vaccination is highly protective against mumps and is recommended for children and adults," said Monica Bharel, the state's public health commissioner, in a statement.

"In addition, those who have mumps should stay isolated at home for 5 days after their onset of swelling. Mumps is usually a mild disease but can cause serious illness. If you think you have mumps, stay home and call your healthcare provider.''

The DPH alerted healthcare providers and local boards of health, in the Greater Boston area, to the outbreak 5 June 2017.

According to the DPH, those diagnosed presented symptoms of mumps between 24 Mar and 31 May [2017], and included members of the Colombian, Dominican, Guatemalan, and Salvadoran communities. None is known to have traveled internationally prior to becoming ill. For the majority of the residents, vaccination histories are unknown; most are believed to be unvaccinated against mumps.

DPH and local health departments are investigating the clusters of outbreaks and instituting measures to prevent further infection. Unvaccinated individuals are most susceptible to mumps infection.

Mumps virus is spread through infected respiratory tract secretions. It can be spread within 3 -- 6 feet when an infected person coughs or sneezes or with direct contact with infected secretions, such as sharing water bottles.

In 2016, according to the DPH, Massachusetts experienced a large mumps outbreak with 252 reported cases, which is more than 15 times the usual number of mumps cases. Those cases were part of a national mumps outbreak, which saw more than 5800 mumps cases, the largest number in a decade.

So far this year [2017] the mumps outbreak continues in Massachusetts, with nearly 300 suspected cases of mumps investigated and 35 cases confirmed, according to the DPH.
