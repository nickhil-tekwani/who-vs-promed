Hepatitis A Is Much More Common in US than Thought
--------------------------------------------------
NEW YORK: Every year, a quarter of a million people in the US may become
infected with hepatitis A, nearly 10 times the number of cases that are
reported to the federal government. What's more, the majority of these
cases may occur in children under the age of 10, a finding which may have
implications for future immunization practices, according to researchers
from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Hepatitis A virus is a liver-infecting virus spread through contaminated
food and water. It is rarely fatal and most often causes jaundice, a
yellowing of the skin due to reduced liver function, and flu-like symptoms
that can persist for weeks. Unlike other forms of hepatitis, it does not
cause a chronic, lingering infection. National surveys have suggested that
47 million Americans have antibodies in their body that recognize hepatitis
A virus, meaning that these individuals were exposed to the virus at some
point in their life. Yet, the number of reported disease cases has been
much lower; only 26 000 a year between 1980 and 1999.
Doctors may not report cases to the federal government, and symptoms in
children are often nonexistent or unrecognizable. For example, symptoms
such as fever and diarrhea are typical of many types of illnesses, and may
not even warrant a doctor's visit. In a paper published in the May 2002
issue of the journal Pediatrics (2002;109:839-845), Armstrong and Bell use
a mathematical model to estimate actual cases of hepatitis A virus
infection by taking into account under-reporting by doctors and patients.
Based on the model, Armstrong and Bell estimate that an average of 271 000
hepatitis A virus infections occurred every year between 1980 and 1999,
10.4 times the actual number reported. Nearly 60 percent of these cases
occurred in children aged 9 years and under, and only about 40 percent were
accompanied with recognizable jaundice symptoms.
The high number of cases in children suggests that: "Vaccinating children
should have a strong herd immunity effect, such that by vaccinating one
child you prevent him or her from becoming infected and from transmitting
an infection to other children and adults," Armstrong said. Armstrong noted
that: "Although it is too early to make policy changes based on these
findings, the data gives further support to the notion that immunizing
children will have a big impact on reducing hepatitis A rates overall."

Polk County Florida: Hepatitis A Outbreak
-----------------------------------------
Following the death of a 29-year-old woman in Bartow, Florida, from
hepatitis A in February 2002, investigators linked her death with a cook at
John's Restaurant who had also been diagnosed with the disease. A total of
5 other people who became infected with the virus also ate at the
restaurant.
Polk County has recorded 138 cases of hepatitis A already this year,
compared to 153 for all of 2000. Based on data from the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, Polk County is reporting cases of hepatitis A at 6
times the national average. Health officials in the county assert that the
outbreak of hepatitis A is due to methamphetamine users who transmit the
virus through sex and needle sharing, and they are working to research each
patient with hepatitis A in order to determine where it started and provide
vaccinations to prevent further spread of the virus.

Abstract: Evaluating the Impact of Hepatitis A Vaccination -- United
States, 1990-2001; Taraz Samandari (Presenter), Wasley A, Bell B.
Background: Hepatitis A is one of the most frequently reported
vaccine-preventable diseases in the United States. In 1999, the Advisory
Committee on Immunization Practices recommended routine hepatitis A
vaccination for children living in 11 high-incidence states (HIS) (average
rate greater than or equal to 20 per 100 000 population during the period
1987-1997), and suggested it for children in 6 intermediate incidence
states (IIS) (average rate 10-19 per 100 000 population). We examined
incidence trends to assess the impact of this policy.
Methods: Hepatitis A rates were determined using data from the National
Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System and population estimates from the
U.S. Census Bureau. Data from 2001 are provisional.
Results: During 1990-2001, overall hepatitis A rates declined 70 percent
from 12.5 per 100 000 to a historic low of 3.8 per 100 000. Rates declined
most dramatically among children 2-18 years (82 vs 61 percent among persons
greater than 18 years old). Despite declines among all racial/ethnic
groups, the decline among Hispanic children (78 percent) lagged behind
non-Hispanic children (92 percent). Compared to average 1987-1997 rates,
by 2001, the rate in HIS declined by 83 percent to 4.5 per 100 000, in IIS
by 77 percent to 3.8 per 100 000 but by only 39 percent to 3.4 per 100 000
elsewhere. HIS cases accounted for 48 percent of the national total during
1987-97, but for only 26 percent of 2001 cases. During 1998-2000, public
sector pediatric vaccine doses purchased by the 17 states increased from
532 885 to 2 723 685, and in 2000, accounted for 95 percent of all such
hepatitis A vaccine purchased.
Conclusions: The precipitous decrease in hepatitis A rates in states where
routine vaccination is recommended and where vaccine purchase was greatest,
suggests that this strategy is reducing disease rates. Continued
monitoring is needed to verify that low rates are sustained and
attributable to vaccination. Reasons for the differential decline in rates
between Hispanic and non-Hispanic children should be identified.
