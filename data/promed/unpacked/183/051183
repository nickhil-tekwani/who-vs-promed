A patient from the Tonosi district [Los Santos province], who had been hospitalized for the past 15 days in the intensive care unit of the Joaquin Pablo Francos Sayas Hospital in Las Tablas, died last night [6 Oct 2014] of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome [HPS].

Friends of the deceased confirmed the individual was a 56-year-old resident of La Corocita, a neighborhood in El Bebedero, Tonosi district. This is the 2nd death from [a] hantavirus [infection] registered in the province so far in 2014, both from Tonosi district.

According to the Ministry of Health [MINSA], the 1st [death] occurred last January [2014]. That deceased was a 19-year-old who was transferred from the Joaquin Pablo Francos Sayas Hospital to the Santo Tomas Hospital in the capital, where he died.

So far this year [2014], MINSA has reported 58 cases of this disease in Los Santos province, of whom 2 died. Of these 58 registered cases, 27 had HPS and 31 hantavirus fever.

Recently, the MINSA Director in Los Santos, Nahir Cedeno, stated that of the 500 metallic grain storage silos provided for the Los Santos province, 325 have been distributed in the [affected] area.

The [health] official advised the population's to clean their residences and store grain adequately [in rodent-proof containers], while the campaign to avoid cases continues.

[The Los Santos province is endemic for Choclo virus, and several cases this year (2014) and in the past have come from Las Tablas. Although not specified in the report above, or previous ones, the hantavirus most likely involved is Choclo virus, since it is the only hantavirus known to cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome with hospitalizations in Panama.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg.

The Chivilcoy Municipal Hospital issued a statement concerning the death of a 15-year-old young girl from [a] hantavirus [infection]. The document stated, "We wish to make clear that for any professional physician, the loss of a patient is a painful event, very sad, and particularly when it is a young person with so much to live for. We join with the family of the girl in their immense loss and their immeasurable pain. The reason for this communication is to clear up and inform [everyone] about hantavirus disease and the practices and treatments that are possible."

The statement adds that it is "an infectious disease caused by a virus transmitted to humans by contact with urine, saliva, and excreta of rodents (long tail [perhaps the yellow pygmy rice rat __Oligoryzomys flavescens_]) through inhalation or through the mucosa.

The Chivilcoy Municipal Hospital officials said, "In this unfortunate case, the patient had consulted days earlier with non-specific symptoms and, as reported, she was treated according to that clinical picture. Since she did not improve, her family took her for another medical consultation on [Thu 18 Sep 2014] where the patient was placed under observation and laboratory and imaging studies were carried out. On [Fri 19 Sep 2014] the results showed a severe thrombocytopenia, indicating [a need for] a platelet transfusion, and she was transferred to the intensive care unit.

"At that time, a request was made through the appropriate channels for her transfer to a hospital capable of caring for more complex cases. Despite the fact that the transfer was not possible for 24 hours, the patient's condition was stable and even a little better with the treatment she was receiving.

"On [Sat 20 Sep 2014] she was transferred to the Rossi Hospital in La Plata, where other diagnostic tests for differential diagnosis, including meningitis, leukemia, etc., were carried out. Despite all the therapeutic and medical efforts the patient died 3 days later, when a postmortem diagnosis of [a] hantavirus [infection] was made."

[Cases of hantavirus infections were reported from various parts of Argentina over the past 3 years (2012, 2013, and 2014). The specific hantaviruses involved in these cases, including the current one above, are not specified. As noted in ProMED-mail archive no 20110430.1348, several hantaviruses have been associated with human infection in Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Lechiguana (in central Argentina in the yellow pygmy rice rat _O. flavescens_); Oran (in north western Argentina in _O. longicaudatus_); and Bermejo (western Argentina in _O. flavescens_). Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved. Andes virus seems unlikely in this case, but this case in Buenos Aires province may have been caused by Lechiguana virus infection.

An image of the yellow pygmy rice rat, _O. flavescens_, is available at http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_WrdzfKHDxmQ/SJ-E642S6MI/AAAAAAAABz4/DaDCHaFSDDE/s400/rato+dagua.jpg.
