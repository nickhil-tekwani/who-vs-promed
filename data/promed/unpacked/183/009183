[The current outbreak is the 3rd one this year [2007] in Thrace,
Turkey's European territory west of the Dardanelles. This area is the
only European territory where FMD vaccination is regularly applied,
as a buffer zone between the Turkish mainland in Asia, where FMD is
endemic, and Europe. These activities are applied in accordance with
the principles and under the continuous follow-up of FAO's (U.N. Food
and Agriculture Organization) European Commission for FMD (EUFMD), of
which Turkey is a member.
According to Turkey's reports to the OIE (World Animal Health
Organisation), 8.7 million (out of a population of about 10.5
million) cattle and 4.4 million (out of a population of about 31.5
million) sheep/goats were vaccinated during 2006.
Turkey's FMD situation, including an overview of the serotypes
detected there throughout the years and detailed current information,
can be viewed in the Turkey page of the FAO World Reference
Laboratory for FMD, at
<http://www.iah.bbsrc.ac.uk/virus/Picornaviridae/Aphthovirus/fmd_genotyping/me/tur.htm>.
Though it may be assumed that the current FMD virus type will be
found to be similar to the previous ones detected earlier this year
[2007] in Thrace, namely serotype O, special attention deserves to be
paid to the early detection of possible introduction of other
strains. According to the annual 2006 report of the EUFMD, an
escalation of a possible new threat caused by a type A variant, and a
highly virulent type O virus, was recognised in epidemics that spread
in western Iran in the autumn of 2006. As a result, FAO issued a
warning of spread of these viruses into Turkey, and has taken steps
to ensure Turkish authorities access to epidemic viruses in order to
gauge the need for a further change in vaccine specification. See the
said and relevant other information in FAO's review "Foot-and-Mouth
Disease: Situation worldwide and major epidemiological events in
2005-2006" available at
<http://www.fao.org/docs/eims/upload//225050/Focus_ON_1_07_en.pdf>.

Turkey's FMD situation:

2. Livestock movement
3. Bovine density
4. Small ruminant density.- Mod.AS]
