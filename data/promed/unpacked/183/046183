A state health official said Tuesday the outbreak [of salmonellosis
attributed to unpasteurized orange juice packaged by the Sun Orchard Co. of
Tempe, Arizona could exceed two dozen cases.
The outbreak could have strong implications for citrus industry efforts to
avoid warning labels on unpasteurized orange juice, Sun Orchard spokesman
Jim Kurtz said Tuesday. He emphasized, however, that company officials had
not seen the Seattle laboratory test results which found salmonella
bacteria in an unopened container of juice with the same genetic strain
linked to the outbreak.
Tests on more unopened containers are pending at a Food and Drug
Administration lab in Los Angeles, Kurtz said. As of Monday, DNA tests had
conclusively tied 14 Seattle-area salmonella cases to Sun Orchard juice,
and another 25 cases may also be linked to the company, said Dr. John
Kobayashi, a Washington state epidemiologist.
[In addition to the Seattle area cases, at least four cases in Oregon and
one involving a New York man who got sick after drinking orange juice at a
hotel in Oakland, California [are under review.
Sun Orchard has been "an active leader" in developing processing methods to
keep disease-causing organisms in unpasteurized orange juice within federal
limits and thus avoid labeling, said Dr. John Kvenberg, FDA chief of hazard
analysis and critical control points.
Starting last fall, FDA required warning labels on all unpasteurized juices
because of several disease outbreaks, including the last orange juice
salmonella cases, the sickening of at least 62 visitors to Disney World in
Orlando, Fla., in mid-1995. Seven people were hospitalized.
The citrus industry won a delay for orange juice, however, while the
alternative pathogen reduction measures were developed and tested.
Kvenberg said that as of July 8, orange juice processors will have three
choices -- pasteurize, label, or follow an FDA-approved fresh-juice
processing method. Generally, he explained, that consists of scrubbing and
chemical washing the whole oranges, hand culling to remove any with breaks
in the skin, and squeezing the juice through a single hole rather than
after cutting the fruit in half.
Sun has an additional step -- "unique in the industry," Kurtz said -- in
which each orange is sent through a steam tunnel for about half a minute
before the hole is made. Juice produced by that method was blended with
juice from outside suppliers in the product linked to the recent salmonella
cases, he said. The outside juice is used only after being tested at an
FDA-approved lab and found to be pathogen-free, Kurtz added.
Sun Orchard has halted production of unpasteurized orange juice, and
Kvenberg said "we would not let them go back to the unpasteurized operation
until we complete our investigation."
Of the 14 confirmed salmonella cases in the Seattle area, nine people were
infected by "smoothies" at local World Wrapps restaurants, one occurred at
a Seattle nursing home and two cases originated at restaurants in Oregon.
The exact sources of the remaining two cases were unknown.
