Public Health Notice: Outbreak of norovirus and gastrointestinal illnesses linked to raw oysters from British Columbia
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Public Health Agency of Canada is collaborating with federal and provincial public health partners to investigate an outbreak of norovirus and gastrointestinal illnesses involving 4 provinces: British Columbia (BC), Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Ontario. Based on the investigation findings to date [31 Mar 2022], the outbreak is linked to consumption of raw oysters from BC. Some oyster harvesting areas in BC that have been associated with illnesses in this outbreak have been closed as a part of the investigation. These closures aim to prevent further illness.

Food recalls were conducted on 18 Feb, 20 Mar, 23 Mar, and 27 Mar 2022 for oysters from BC. Links to each food recall associated with this investigation can be found at the end of this public health notice [see original URL]. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) is continuing its food safety investigation, which may lead to the recall of other products. If other products are recalled, the CFIA will notify the public through updated food recall warnings.

Do not eat, use, sell, or serve the recalled oysters. Also, avoid eating raw or undercooked oysters to reduce your risk of foodborne illness and follow proper food handling practices. Cook oysters to an internal temperature of 90 deg Celsius (194 deg Fahrenheit) for a minimum of 90 seconds.

The outbreak investigation is ongoing, and additional actions to protect public health will be taken as needed. This public health notice will be updated as the investigation evolves.

Investigation summary
---------------------
As of 30 Mar 2022, there have been 279 cases of norovirus and gastrointestinal illness linked to consumption of BC oysters reported in the following provinces: BC (262), Alberta (1), Saskatchewan (1), and Ontario (15). Individuals became sick between mid-January [2022] and late March 2022, and no deaths have been reported. Although not all cases of illness have been tested, testing of several cases has confirmed the presence of a norovirus infection.

Who is most at risk
-------------------
Acute gastrointestinal illnesses such as norovirus illness are common in North America and are very contagious, affecting all age groups. However, pregnant women, people with compromised immune systems, young children, and the elderly are at risk for developing more serious complications, like dehydration.

What you should do to protect your health
-------------------------------------
Raw oysters contaminated with noroviruses may look, smell, and taste normal. The following safe food-handling practices will reduce your risk of getting sick:
- Do not eat, use, sell, or serve any recalled oysters.
- Avoid eating raw or undercooked oysters. Cook oysters to an internal temperature of 90 deg Celsius (194 deg Fahrenheit) for a minimum of 90 seconds before eating.
- Discard any oysters that did not open while cooking.
- Eat oysters right away after cooking and refrigerate leftovers.
- Always keep raw and cooked oysters separate to avoid cross-contamination.
- Do not use the same plate or utensils for raw and cooked shellfish, and wash counters and utensils with soap and warm water after preparation.
- Wash your hands well with soap before and after handling any food. Be sure to clean and sanitize cutting boards, counters, knives, and other utensils after preparing raw foods.

Noroviruses can be transmitted by ill individuals and are able to survive relatively high levels of chlorine and varying temperatures. Cleaning and disinfecting practices are the key to preventing further illnesses in your home.
- Thoroughly clean contaminated surfaces, and disinfect using chlorine bleach, especially after an episode of illness.
- After vomiting or diarrhea, immediately remove and wash clothing or linens that may be contaminated with the virus (use hot water and soap).
- If you have been diagnosed with norovirus illness or any other gastrointestinal illness, do not prepare food or pour drinks for other people while you have symptoms, and for the 1st 48 hours after you recover.

Symptoms
----------
People with norovirus illness usually develop symptoms of gastroenteritis within 24 to 48 hours, but symptoms can start as early as 12 hours after exposure. The illness often begins suddenly. Even after having the illness, you can still become re-infected by norovirus.

What the Government of Canada is doing
---------------------------------------
The Government of Canada is committed to food safety. The Public Health Agency of Canada leads the human health investigation of an outbreak and is in regular contact with its federal and provincial partners to monitor and take collaborative steps to address outbreaks. Health Canada provides food-related health risk assessments to determine whether the presence of a certain substance or microorganism poses a health risk to consumers.

The CFIA conducts food safety investigations into the possible food source of an outbreak. CFIA also monitors for biotoxins in shellfish in harvesting areas and is responsible for registering and inspecting fish and shellfish processing plants. The CFIA may recommend that affected sites or areas be opened or closed based on epidemiological information, sample testing results and/or relevant harvest area information.

Fisheries and Oceans Canada is responsible for opening and closing shellfish harvest areas and enforcing closures under the authority of the Fisheries Act and the Management of Contaminated Fishery Regulations.

Under the Canadian Shellfish Sanitation Program, Environment and Climate Change Canada monitors pollution sources and sanitary conditions in shellfish growing waters.

The Government of Canada will continue to update Canadians as new information related to this investigation becomes available.

Epidemiological information
---------------------------
Figure 1 [for figure, see original URL] is an epidemiological curve for this outbreak, which shows the numbers of new cases by week. Outbreak investigators use this information to show when illnesses begin, when they peak, and when they trail off. It can take several weeks from the time a person becomes ill to when the illness is reported and linked to the outbreak. Data are available for 279 cases.

[Uncooked shellfish are a common vehicle for norovirus infection.

Norovirus can be transmitted by
- eating food or drinking liquids that are contaminated with norovirus;
- touching surfaces or objects contaminated with norovirus and then putting your fingers in your mouth; or
- having direct contact with someone who is infected with norovirus, such as by caring for them or sharing food or eating utensils with them.

The 1st sign of norovirus is usually a sudden sick feeling, followed by forceful vomiting and watery diarrhea. Some people may also have a raised temperature (over 38 deg C / 100.4 deg F), headaches, stomach cramps, and aching limbs. Symptoms usually appear 1-2 days after exposure to infection, but they can start sooner. Most people make a full recovery within a few days. Apart from the risk of dehydration, the illness is not generally dangerous, and there are usually no long-lasting effects from norovirus infection.

While norovirus could be considered here, diarrheal shellfish poisoning (DSP) is a distinct possibility. DSP "is a gastrointestinal illness caused by the consumption of shellfish contaminated with algal toxins produced by marine dinoflagellates belonging to the genera _Dinophysis_ spp. (_D. fortii_, _D. mitra_, _D. rotundata_, _D. tripos_, _D. acuta_, _D. norvegica_, and _D. acuminata_) and _Prorocentrum_ spp. (_P. lima_, _P. maculosum_, _P. concavum_, and _P. hoffmannianum_). The DSP toxins, including okadaic acid (OA) and its analogues dinophysistoxin-1 (DTX-1), dinophysistoxin-2 (DTX-2), and dinophysistoxin-3 (DTX-3), belong to the larger group of lipophilic toxins that also includes the azaspiracid, yessotoxin, and pectenotoxin group toxins."
(https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/ese.16.46.20020-en)

The term diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) is often used for the illness, but this moderator prefers to use diarrheal shellfish poisoning to avoid any confusion between the almost homophones of diarrhetic and diuretic.

DSP is often mistaken for norovirus-like disease. It is treated with rehydration, and affected individuals usually recover in 1 to 2 days. DSP diarrhea is the most commonly reported symptom (92%), closely followed by nausea (80%) and vomiting (79%), with onset 30 minutes to 12 hours from ingestion. Cooking or freezing does not destroy the toxin. DSP is most commonly found in shellfish in Europe and Japan but can appear anywhere and bears consideration with the appropriate epidemiology. - Mod.LL
