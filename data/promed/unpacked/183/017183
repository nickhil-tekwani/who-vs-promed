A sick egret found in Hong Kong last week has tested positive for the
virulent H5N1 strain of bird flu, the government said Saturday [24
Nov 2007]. The bird, which was collected from a park Sunday and died
the next day, was confirmed to have had the disease after several
laboratory tests, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation
Department said in a statement.

Hong Kong has occasionally found avian influenza in wild birds but
hasn't suffered a major outbreak of the disease lately.

Hong Kong aggressively monitors bird flu because the 1st documented
cases of the disease in humans occurred in the territory. An outbreak
of H5N1 in 1997 killed 6 people. That prompted the government to
slaughter the entire poultry population of about 1.5 million birds.

More cases of a deadly strain of bird flu have been found at a
poultry farm in Saudi Arabia just weeks before Muslims travel to
Mecca for the annual Haj pilgrimage, the Ministry of Agriculture said
on Monday [26 Nov 2007]. A statement published in the official Saudi
Press Agency said all birds at the farm at al-Kharj, 150 km (94
miles) south of Riyadh were culled on Thursday after the H5N1 strain
was found there. It gave no more details.

Saudi authorities killed 50 000 birds in al-Kharj earlier this month
[November 2007] after 1500 birds died of unspecified causes, and
inspection teams have since then culled thousands more at markets
around the capital of around 4 million people.

The discovery comes just a few weeks before nearly 2 million faithful
arrive for the Haj pilgrimage season in Mecca.

The Saudi government says it has large stocks of Tamiflu anti-flu
tablets in case the virus spreads to humans.

In March 2007, Saudi Arabia said the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu
had been discovered in peacocks, turkeys, ostriches and parrots at a
house in the east of the kingdom and that an unspecified number of
birds in the area had been culled.

Officials in Burma say a new outbreak of bird flu has been detected
among chickens in an eastern district near the Chinese border.

The state-run New Light of Myanmar newspaper said Saturday [24 Nov
2007] that the outbreak was found at a farm in Kentung township in
eastern Shan state on 18 Nov 2007, after a farmer reported an unusual
number of deaths in his chickens.

Officials culled an unknown number of birds at the farm.

A statement from the Myanmar Livestock and Veterinary Department
urged people to prevent the entry of poultry and birds from
neighboring countries into Burma.

seems to be based upon clinical field observations. - Mod.AS]
