Almost 20 people have fallen ill in Sweden during April 2021 from histamine poisoning in fish from Viet Nam. The foodborne outbreak at the beginning of April 2021 affected 19 people in Stockholm. Guests eating tuna at 3 different restaurants in Stockholm reported symptoms of histamine poisoning. All 3 restaurants purchased frozen tuna loins with the same expiry date from the same supplier, indicating that high levels of histamine occurred before the tuna was brought into Sweden from Viet Nam via the Netherlands.

In March 2021, Italian authorities reported an outbreak caused by histamine in frozen yellowfin tuna loins from Viet Nam, via the Netherlands but did not say how many people were affected. In 2020, Sweden recorded 3 outbreaks of histamine poisoning in tuna from Viet Nam in 3 months. These outbreaks affected about 60 people but were not directly related as the tuna originated from different batches. Patients were from different areas in southern and central Sweden.

Onset of histamine food poisoning symptoms can range from minutes to several hours following ingestion of the toxin. Typically, the average incubation period before illness is one hour. The most common symptoms of histamine, also known as scombroid fish poisoning, are tingling or burning sensation in the mouth, facial swelling, rash, hives and itchy skin, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. They usually resolve within several hours without medical intervention. Production of histamine is related to mishandling of food because of storage at incorrect temperatures. Once produced, histamine cannot be eliminated by normal cooking or freezing temperatures.

Meanwhile, new legislation has come in from this month [April 2021] in Sweden that includes food control authorities being able to make purchases without disclosing their identity as an official agency until afterward. This makes it easier to check that food on the market is what it claims to be, does not mislead consumers, and that it is not harmful to health. It applies to distance purchases such as e-commerce and to physical stores. Previously, there had been no support in law for authorities to act without making themselves known. The changes were made to bring domestic rules into line with EU regulations. Finally, the government has commissioned the Swedish Board of Agriculture and Swedish Veterinary Institute to do a feasibility study on measures to effectively prevent and manage the presence of Salmonella in farm animals.

"Abstract
--------
"Histamine poisoning results from the consumption of foods, typically certain types of fish and cheeses that contain unusually high levels of histamine. Spoiled fish of the families Scombridae and Scomberesocidae (such as tuna, mackerel, bonito) are commonly implicated in incidents of histamine poisoning, which leads to the common usage of the term "scombroid fish poisoning" to describe this illness. However, certain non-scombroid fish, most notably mahi-mahi, bluefish, and sardines, when spoiled, are also commonly implicated in histamine poisoning. Also, on rare occasions, cheeses, especially Swiss cheese, can be implicated in histamine poisoning. The symptoms of histamine poisoning generally resemble the symptoms encountered with IgE-mediated food allergies. The symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, an oral burning sensation or peppery taste, hives, itching, red rash, and hypotension. The onset of the symptoms usually occurs within a few minutes after ingestion of the implicated food, and the duration of symptoms ranges from a few hours to 24 hours. Antihistamines can be used effectively to treat this intoxication. Histamine is formed in foods by certain bacteria that are able to decarboxylate the amino acid histidine. However, foods containing unusually high levels of histamine may not appear to be outwardly spoiled. Foods with histamine concentrations exceeding 50 mg per 100 g of food are generally considered to be hazardous. Histamine formation in fish can be prevented by proper handling and refrigerated storage while the control of histamine formation in cheese seems dependent on ensuring that histamine-producing bacteria are not present in significant numbers in the raw milk."

"Abstract
--------
"Scombroid poisoning, also called histamine fish poisoning, is an allergy-like form of food poisoning that continues to be a major problem in seafood safety. The exact role of histamine in scombroid poisoning is not straightforward. Deviations from the expected dose-response have led to the advancement of various possible mechanisms of toxicity, none of them proven. Histamine action levels are used in regulation until more is known about the mechanism of scombroid poisoning. Scombroid poisoning and histamine are correlated but complicated. Victims of scombroid poisoning respond well to antihistamines, and chemical analyses of fish implicated in scombroid poisoning generally reveal elevated levels of histamine. Scombroid poisoning is unique among the seafood toxins since it results from product mishandling rather than contamination from other trophic levels. Inadequate cooling following harvest promotes bacterial histamine production and can result in outbreaks of scombroid poisoning. Fish with high levels of free histidine, the enzyme substrate converted to histamine by bacterial histidine decarboxylase, are those most often implicated in scombroid poisoning. Laboratory methods and screening methods for detecting histamine are available in abundance but need to be compared and validated to harmonize testing. Successful field testing, including dockside or on-board testing needed to augment HACCP efforts will have to integrate rapid and simplified detection methods with simplified and rapid sampling and extraction. Otherwise, time-consuming sample preparation reduces the impact of gains in detection speed on the overall analysis time."
