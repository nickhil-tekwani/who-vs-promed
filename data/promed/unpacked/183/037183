From: "Pawin Padungtod DVM" <padungto@cvm.msu.edu>

Dr. Pranee Tuntivanich, a veterinary ophthalmologist is visiting with me
this week. She suggested that:
1. Uveitis may be the cause of blindness.
2. Vitamin A deficiency may contributed to the problem seen.
3. Conjunctival sac should be checked for foreign body.
4. Check eyelash diseases such as entropion or abnormal hair growth under
eyelids.
5. Use Schirmer tear list to check for dry eye
She also saw a case in a dog, which after 5 days of Ivermectin
administration, developed severe conjunctivitis, chemosis, keratitis and
subsequently blind with corneal opacity. Ivermectin may also [have affected
corneal endothelium.

[ItÂ´s looking more & more as though Ivermectin may be the culprit. We would
like to hear back from the zoo in Israel - Mod.JW
