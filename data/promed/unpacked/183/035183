Fungus causing losses in maize yields
-------------------------------------
Maize is the staple diet for thousands of Guatemalans. Farmers of Alta
Verapaz, Quiche, and Peten have been hit since last December [2008] by a
fungus called 'slick asphalt', which blackens maize crops, reported the
National Basic Grains Commission (Conagrab).

The president of Conagrab, Alberto Ical, said that crop losses of up to 75
per cent due to this fungus have been reported in Chisec, Alta Verapaz, and
La Chapina, Quiche, where maize production of 30 000 and 40 000 quintals
[3000 and 4000 tonnes], respectively, had been estimated. Outbreaks of the
disease have also been detected in Sayaxche, Peten, with estimated crop
losses of 50 per cent, Ical added.

Edgar Grisolia, deputy minister of agriculture, confirmed the appearance of
the fungus in maize and said he ordered an investigation to determine the
origin of the problem and how to fight it. In any event, he explained,
farmers were provided with fungicides and some spray pumps. "We can defeat
(the disease), but if there are losses it is because they did not apply it
(the fungicide) correctly," the official said. The deputy minister said
that for now, there is no shortage of grain in the market, and that, if
necessary, the import quotas opened by the Ministry of Economy would be used.

A group of researchers at the Institute of Agricultural Sciences and
Technology (ICTA) and others visited Ixcan, Quiche, to determine the
details of the problem, reported Oscar Salazar, technician at this
institution. The appearance of the fungus was reported in April 2007, when
it destroyed maize plantings in areas of Peten. Losses were estimated at 60
per cent of local production. According to Salazar, the spread in the
country is already cause for alarm. Grisolia and Salazar agreed that one
way to prevent this and other diseases of maize is the use of improved seed.

The disease occurs in cool and humid conditions. Spots first appear on the
lower leaves before flowering. Lesions may merge causing complete necrosis
of foliage. Lumps of deep black colour are formed. The disease does not
allow the ears to develop properly leading to poor quality grain. Only
small kernels are produced, and those at the tip of the ears germinate
prematurely.

[There are a large number of fungal pathogens that can affect maize. From
the description of symptoms, especially the 'black lumps', perhaps a form
of smut may be implicated. We would be most grateful for any information as
to what this disease may be.
