Mystery disease affecting banana plantations in Johor
-----------------------------------------------------
Many banana farmers in the state are making losses after their
plantations were struck by a mysterious disease. Agriculture and
Agro-based Industry Committee chairman Abdul Aziz Kaprawi said the
disease had destroyed the banana trees and source of income for 1463
farmers since last year [2007].

"The state agriculture department has done extensive researches on
the disease. The department personnel have also explained to the
farmers on ways to curb the disease by using good farming practices,"
he said at the Johor state assembly Wednesday [10 Dec 2008].

He said that the department had also encouraged farmers to practise
"planting cycles" by alternatively planting other crops such as
bamboo and tapioca [cassava] at their banana plantation, which
accounted for about 2315 ha [5720 acres] of land. "The department is
assisting the farmers to utilise the cycle by supplying them with MYR
300 [USD 84] worth of fertilizer for each hectare of land. More than
11 000 bags of fertilisers have been supplied to the farmers affected
by the disease," he said.

[From this report, it is impossible to draw conclusions about the
nature of this disease. We would be most grateful for any further
information on possible pathogens involved.

A general increase in banana diseases, especially Panama disease (see
ProMED-mail post no. 20080816.2541), has been reported from Malaysia
in recent years. Banana cultivation is carried out largely by
smallholders who are often not trained well in disease management.
The crop rotation recommended above is generally a good way to
interrupt disease cycles of pathogens if non-host species for
intermediate planting can be identified. Cassava and bamboo are not
closely related to banana, but whether they are suitable for crop
rotation in this case can only be determined with certainty once the
pathogen is known.
