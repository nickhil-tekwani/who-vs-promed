Measles epidemic in the capital
-------------------------------
Sources at the Provincial Health Delegation reported to Europa Press that
during the measles outbreak registered in Granada [the capital city of
Granada province], the number of infected people has increased to 20,
including 4 minors who were admitted to the Maternal and Child Hospital of
Granada but whose condition is not serious.

The 1st case was detected in the Gomez Moreno Preschool and Primary School,
located in the Albaicin neighbourhood, among a group of children who had
not been vaccinated by their parents, a situation which led to the outbreak
spreading to the other people, 5 of whom were from the school and [of these
only] 2 adults.

The health authorities have advised parents of students at this school to
have their children vaccinated immediately, and newsletters are being sent
to them urging them to have to all their schoolchildren vaccinated, if not
previously immunised.

The Andalusian health minister, Maria Jesus Montero, stated last week [week
of 1 Nov 2010] that "measles is usually a disease that progresses with mild
symptoms and no major consequences," and stressed that measles is one of
the diseases "that can be eradicated because there is an effective vaccine
available to immunise the population."

Of the 20 cases recorded so far, 4 have been admitted to the Maternal and
Child Hospital, but none of them is seriously ill.
