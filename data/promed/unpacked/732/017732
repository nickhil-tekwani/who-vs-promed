[The BTV-8 event in Switzerland, of which most cases are concentrated in the northwest, adjacent to the Swiss-German-French tripoint, reportedly started in late 2017 (2 cattle farms in October), returning, similarly in cattle, in September 2018. The cases in cattle were reportedly subclinical, detected within the framework of an active surveillance program; 4 outbreaks were recorded in sheep, with the 1st one starting 12 Oct 2018, followed by 3 additional outbreaks on sheep farms, starting 16 Oct 2018 (reported to the OIE 1 Feb 2019), 31 Oct 2018 and 7 Nov 2018. Different from the outbreaks in cattle, the cases in sheep were identified by clinical signs, which were lab confirmed.

Here follows OIE's (continuing) event summary, as of 1 Feb 2019:

Total outbreaks = 79 (submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Cattle / 4894 / 148 / 0 / 7 / 68
Sheep / 212 / 6 / 1 / 2 / 0

The above summary, with details of all 79 outbreaks and a map, is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000029323_20190201_135905.pdf.

BTV-8 renewed its circulation in France in 2016, spreading to Switzerland and, in late 2018, to southwest Germany, where it has spread northward toward Luxembourg. The following excerpt from an assessment of the recent German event, published by UK's DEFRA International Disease Monitoring team on 21 Jan 2019 (references omitted), may add some useful background on the regional situation.

"The 5 more northerly outbreaks in Saarland and Rheinland-Pfalz may be due to the movement of cattle from south-west regions of Germany, rather than vector-borne spread from France over the past few weeks. Indeed, the vector season has ended and due to the heavy snow currently in southern Germany and Switzerland, midge activity is unlikely to be the cause at this stage. Two new German regions now fall into the restriction zones -- Hessen and North Rhine Westphalia. Post import testing is in place for these areas.

"Vaccination of cattle against BTV has been recommended in Germany since February 2016 on a voluntary basis because of the BTV cases in neighbouring France and Switzerland. However, vaccination is not mandatory as it is in France and Switzerland, and according to the Competent Authority, only about 25% vaccine coverage has been achieved, which is not sufficient for the comprehensive prevention of outbreaks. For this purpose, at least 80% of susceptible animals must be vaccinated.

"The reports documented here of spread in south-western Germany and western Germany suggest wider spread to other parts of Germany could have occurred through previous movement of cattle from the south-west. Animals that have been vaccinated against BTV-8 are protected against reinfection; however, the duration of protection is limited, in some cases to one year, dependent on vaccine used. In addition, the current BTV-8 seems to be less virulent than the virus which circulated in Germany from 2006, as there have been many reports of subclinical infection in France and Switzerland this year. However, there are reports from Switzerland indicating higher levels of virulence in sheep (including some deaths). BTV-8 was last reported in France on 24 Dec 2018. As of the end of November [2018], average temperatures in the past 2 weeks (from mid to end November) in Northern France and Southern England had been on or below the threshold for vector transmission (12 deg C [54 deg F])."
