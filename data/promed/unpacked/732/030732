Laboratory testing by the Department of Health has identified _Clostridium perfringens_ as the cause of the about 50-person outbreak associated with the Pierre-Mitchell high school boys' basketball game held in Pierre, SD, 31 Jan 2012. The investigation, which included voluntary questionnaires, implicated tacos as the source food of the outbreak. Of those completing questionnaires, 75 percent who ate the tacos reported becoming ill.

The Health Department says, the predominant symptoms were diarrhea and cramps lasting less than 24 hours, although the symptoms in some ill persons lasted longer. It was reported 75 percent of the cases became ill between midnight and 6:00 AM following the game.

_Clostridium perfringens_ is a bacterium that is sometimes found on raw meat and poultry products. It is also found in many environmental sources and in the intestines of animals and humans. _Clostridium perfringens_ poisoning can occur when quantities of food are prepared and kept at unsafe temperatures. Anyone can get food poisoning from _Clostridium perfringens_, but the very young and elderly are at highest risk. Dehydration may occur in severe cases. The illness is not passed from one person to another.

This type of food poisoning can be prevented by proper cooking and proper refrigeration. Meat dishes should be served hot, immediately after cooking. Leftover foods should be refrigerated at 40 degrees F or lower. Large pots of food, such as soups or stews, or large cuts of meats, such as roasts or whole poultry, should be divided into small quantities for refrigeration.

Foods that have dangerous bacteria in them may not taste, smell, or look different. Any food that has been left out too long may be dangerous to eat, even if it looks okay.

[Unlike staphylococcal foodborne illness where the preformed toxin is ingested, in _C. perfringes_ disease the enterotoxin is formed _in situ_ in the gastrointestinal tract. The following discussion is obtained from the FDA Bad Bug Book
http://www.fda.gov/food/foodsafety/foodborneillness/foodborneillnessfoodbornepathogensnaturaltoxins/badbugbook/ucm070483.htm:

1. Name of the Organism:
_Clostridium perfringens_ is an anaerobic, Gram-positive, sporeforming rod. It is widely distributed in the environment and frequently occurs in the intestines of humans and many domestic and feral animals. Spores of the organism persist in soil, sediments, and areas subject to human or animal fecal pollution.

2. Nature of Acute Disease:
Perfringens food poisoning is the term used to describe the common foodborne illness caused by _C. perfringens_. A more serious but rare illness is also caused by ingesting food contaminated with Type C strains. The latter illness is known as enteritis necroticans or pig-bel disease.

3. Nature of Disease:
The common form of perfringens poisoning is characterized by intense abdominal cramps and diarrhea which begin 8-22 hours after consumption of foods containing large numbers of those _C. perfringens_ bacteria capable of producing the food poisoning toxin. The illness is usually over within 24 hours but less severe symptoms may persist in some individuals for 1 or 2 weeks. A few deaths have been reported as a result of dehydration and other complications.

Necrotic enteritis (pig-bel) caused by _C. perfringens_ is often fatal. This disease also begins as a result of ingesting large numbers of the causative bacteria in contaminated foods. Deaths from necrotic enteritis (pig-bel syndrome) are caused by infection and necrosis of the intestines and from resulting septicemia. This disease is very rare in the USA.

Infective dose -- The symptoms are caused by ingestion of large numbers (greater than 100 0000 000) vegetative cells. Toxin production in the digestive tract (or in test tubes) is associated with sporulation. This disease is a food infection; only one episode has ever implied the possibility of intoxication (i.e., disease from preformed toxin).

4. Diagnosis of Human Illness:
Perfringens poisoning is diagnosed by its symptoms and the typical delayed onset of illness. Diagnosis is confirmed by detecting the toxin in the feces of patients. Bacteriological confirmation can also be done by finding exceptionally large numbers of the causative bacteria in implicated foods or in the feces of patients.

5. Associated Foods:
In most instances, the actual cause of poisoning by _C. perfringens_ is temperature abuse of prepared foods. Small numbers of the organisms are often present after cooking and multiply to food poisoning levels during cool down and storage of prepared foods. Meats, meat products, and gravy are the foods most frequently implicated.

6. Relative Frequency of Disease:
Perfringens poisoning is one of the most commonly reported foodborne illnesses in the USA. There were 1162 cases in 1981, in 28 separate outbreaks. At least 10-20 outbreaks have been reported annually in the USA for the past 2 decades. Typically, dozens or even hundreds of person are affected. It is probable that many outbreaks go unreported because the implicated foods or patient feces are not tested routinely for _C. perfringens_ or its toxin. CDC estimates that about 10 000 actual cases occur annually in the USA.

7. Course of Disease and Complications:
The disease generally lasts 24 hours. In the elderly or infirm, symptoms may last 1-2 weeks. Complications and/or death only very rarely occur.

8. Target Populations:
Institutional feeding (such as school cafeterias, hospitals, nursing homes, prisons, etc.) where large quantities of food are prepared several hours before serving is the most common circumstance in which perfringens poisoning occurs. The young and elderly are the most frequent victims of perfringens poisoning. Except in the case of pig-bel syndrome, complications are few in persons under 30 years of age. Elderly persons are more likely to experience prolonged or severe symptoms.

9. Food Analysis:
Standard bacteriological culturing procedures are used to detect the organism in implicated foods and in feces of patients. Serological assays are used for detecting enterotoxin in the feces of patients and for testing the ability of strains to produce toxin. The procedures take 1-3 days. - Mod.LL]
