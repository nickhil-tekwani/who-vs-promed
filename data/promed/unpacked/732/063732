[Switzerland obtained its status as a country officially free of bovine tuberculosis in 1960. Since 1980, the control of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) has been reduced to passive abattoir surveillance, in line with OIE's requirements as specified in chapter 11.6 of OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code (http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.11.6.htm).

Isolated cases of bTB, partly due to reactivation of human _Mycobacterium bovis_ infections with subsequent transmission to cattle, have been noticed in Switzerland during the years. Other possible sources of infection (but not necessarily in Switzerland) may be wildlife and introduced traded animals which had not undergone testing prior to transportation, particularly from other countries where bTB incidence is higher, even if such countries have, so far, managed to maintain their status as "officially free", since "_M. bovis_ infection was not present in at least 99.8 per cent of the herds and 99.9 per cent of the cattle for 5 consecutive years".

Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is caused primarily by _Mycobacterium bovis_ spp. _bovis_ (_M. bovis_) and, to a lesser extent, by _Mycobacterium bovis_ spp. _caprae_ (_M. caprae_). The current case described has, reportedly been caused by _M. bovis_. The infection was detected in a slaughtered 11 year old cow thanks to the prescribed, compulsory postmortem veterinary inspection in the slaughterhouse.

It is anticipated that the herd of origin will be tuberculin-tested to discover or exclude additional infected animals. Such testing may be considered also in contact herds, to prevent spread and to discover the origin of infection.

Switzerland's cattle population (OIE's 2011 data) is 1 591 233, kept in 41 095 establishments.

The location of this event, in western Switzerland, is indicated in the interactive map at the source URL above.

The diagnostic methods pertaining to _M. bovis_ are described in chapter 2.4.7 of OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals 2012, at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.04.07_BOVINE_TB.pdf. - Mod.AS
