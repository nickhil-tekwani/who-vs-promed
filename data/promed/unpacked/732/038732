Farm ministry ready to order vaccination
-------------------------------------------------
The Government is so concerned about the spread of foot-and-mouth disease
in North Yorkshire that ministers have approved a contingency plan for a
firebreak vaccination screen. [Only 5 months after the outbreak began,
with the spread of the virus around Thirsk and Whitby threatening the pig
industry of East Yorkshire, ministers have been forced to accept that the
controversial approach may well be needed. Ben Gill, the president of the
National Farmers Union, which has been strongly opposed to vaccination, has
accepted that if slaughter failed it might be necessary.
The recommendation to go ahead with vaccination will depend on advice from
Jim Scudamore, the Government's Chief Veterinary Officer. Mr Scudamore is
working on a review of the use of vaccination in each of the hotspot areas:
Thirsk, Whitby, Penrith, the Settle-Clitheroe cluster, and mid-Wales. The
Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has set up an
implementation program for vaccination in each area that could be
operational within 2 to 3 days of a decision to vaccination. Centers for
distribution of vaccine and staff to administer it have been identified.
It is clear, however, that ministers have already been told that if the
cases persist in the North Yorkshire area and if they move closer to the
main pig production area in the East Riding, vaccination will be imposed.
Any new case near York or Malton would signal a change of policy to ensure
that the virus does not reach the 3 million pigs reared in the eastern
area. About one third of the country's pig production takes place in
Yorkshire and adjoining Lincolnshire. Vaccination would both protect the
industry and ensure that the disease did not spread widely among pigs,
which propagate the disease far more quickly than do sheep or cattle.
The Government is expected to receive provisional EU approval for
vaccination of pigs this month; permission for use in cattle was given in
March. Mr Scudamore and ministers are hoping that in the meantime the new
licensing and movement controls in the hotspot area will eliminate the
disease. If these controls do not work a firebreak program to vaccinate
cattle and pigs in a ring zone is inevitable. The vaccination of sheep has,
however, been ruled out. Senior vets do not believe it would be
cost-effective. It is not clear whether sheep within a firebreak zone would
be slaughtered or blood tested.
Ministers have also been told that vaccination will also be likely if the
massive serological testing program of sheep now under way in hot spot
areas reveals a massive residue of infection. Mr Scudamore and farmers'
leaders believe that the disease is not endemic but they cannot be
confident until the test results are known. A change of weather with heavy
rainfall and cold spells could also trigger use of vaccination, as it would
aid the spread of the virus. Any animals which were inoculated would be
eventually slaughtered, under current plans. A-vaccinate-to-live policy for
animals is favored by ministers but food processing companies and
supermarkets have told ministers that they do not believe consumers will
buy the meat from vaccinated animals.
Farmers' leaders would expect some indemnity from the Government if
vaccination went ahead without a requirement for future slaughter to ensure
that markets for their products were not lost. Some ministers believe,
however, that if vaccination is necessary later in the autumn, once
Parliament has returned, emergency powers could be used to compel companies
to put the vaccinated animals into the human food chain. One senior
government source said: If the critical point is later in the autumn it may
be possible to bring in a new law. The Dutch originally planned to
vaccinate to live, but consumer resistance forced a change in policy.

2 Aug 2001: 1921 confirmed outbreaks in UK.
----------------------------------------------
7 new outbreaks between 17:00 31 Jul and 17:00 1 Aug 2001 (5 in Cumbria + 2
in North Yorkshire - at Ugthorpe, Whitby and Balk, Thirsk). The new
outbreaks in N. Yorkshire bring the virus a little closer still to the
country's main pig production areas (3 million pigs) of Humberside and
Lincolnshire.
