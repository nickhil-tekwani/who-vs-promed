Just in case you needed further convincing, a new study that examined medical records from more than 81 000 American children has found absolutely no increased prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in children whose mothers received vaccines for potentially deadly infections while pregnant.

The analysis, published today [13 Aug 2018] in the journal Pediatrics, was performed by Kaiser Permanente researchers using data from children born at southern California Kaiser hospitals between January 2011 and December 2014. The vaccine of interest in this case -- the infamous link to the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine has already been thoroughly discredited -- was the Tdap, a combined immunization that protects both mother and baby against the 3 pathogenic bacteria species that cause tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (also known as whooping cough).

Among the 81 993 naturally conceived children included in the study, 1341 were clinically diagnosed with ASD between their 1st birthday and June 2017. The incidence of the disorder in the vaccinated group was 1.5 percent, compared with 1.8 percent for the unvaccinated group. After adjusting for numerous potential confounders, including child's birth year, whether the baby was born prematurely, ethnicity, maternal age, maternal education, geographic location, start of prenatal care, flu vaccination during pregnancy, and whether the child was the 1st born (past work has indicated that birth order affects development of ASD), the authors concluded that there is no risk of ASD from Tdap.

"The link between vaccination and development of autism has been refuted by many rigorous scientific investigations. Unfortunately, the misconceptions still generate concerns," senior author Hung Fu Tseng said in a statement. "Given the increasing practice to vaccinate pregnant women with Tdap vaccine, it was important to address the concern of a link between maternal vaccination and subsequent development of autism spectrum disorder [ASD] in children," he added. "We hope that our findings reassure parents that Tdap vaccination during pregnancy was not associated with autism in children."

Tseng and his colleagues note that the proportion of expecting women who elected for Tdap vaccines grew during the study period, from 26 percent in 2012 to 79 percent in 2014. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the American College of Nurse-Midwives all recommend that pregnant women receive a Tdap during their 3rd trimester [in each of their pregnancies] so that their babies will have antibodies for these bacteria upon birth [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis-statements/tdap.html].

Interestingly, the overall rates of ASD declined during the study period, from 2.0 to 1.5 percent in the unvaccinated group and from 1.8 to 1.2 percent in the vaccinated group. Though no single factor has yet to be definitely linked to ASD, inherited variations in several dozen genes regulating brain activity have been implicated [https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/autism-genetics-explained/], as have environmental factors that could induce epigenetic changes, such as exposure to high levels of maternal testosterone in utero [http://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/women-with-symptoms-of-polycystic-ovarian-syndrome-are-more-likely-to-have-autistic-children/].

Not knowing how to reduce the likelihood that your child will have this disorder -- and thus struggle with social interaction -- may be scary for parents, but as literally all the credible peer-reviewed science supports, refusing to vaccinate is not the solution. Immunizations are essential not only for the health of your child [http://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/another-myth-about-cumulative-childhood-vaccinations-is-busted/] but also for the health of human populations as a whole [http://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/how-much-does-a-single-measles-outbreak-cost-us-all/].

[A research paper was published in The Lancet in 1998 that purported to link the MMR vaccine to autism spectrum disorders. Subsequently the author of the Lancet paper, Andrew Wakefield, was found to have manipulated evidence that resulted in the paper being fully retracted in 2010. Wakefield was found guilty by the General Medical Council of professional misconduct in 2010 and lost his license to practice medicine in the UK. The scientific consensus is the MMR vaccine has no link to the development of autism, and that benefits of this vaccine greatly outweigh any risks.

The journal article cited in the news report above similarly found Tdap, the tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis vaccine, was not associated with an increased ASD risk when used during pregnancy (1). The journal article's abstract is extracted below.

Abstract
--------
"Background. Increasing vaccination of pregnant women makes it important to assess safety events potentially linked to prenatal vaccination. This study investigates the association between prenatal tetanus, diphtheria, acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccination and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk in offspring.

"Methods. This is a retrospective cohort study of mother-child pairs with deliveries January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2014 at Kaiser Permanente Southern California hospitals. Maternal Tdap vaccination from pregnancy start to delivery date was obtained from electronic medical records. A diagnosis of ASD was obtained by using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revision codes. Children were managed from birth to first ASD diagnosis, end of membership, or end of follow-up (June 30, 2017). Cox proportional hazards models estimated the unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for the association between maternal Tdap vaccination and ASD, with inverse probability of treatment weighting to adjust for confounding.

"Results. Women vaccinated were more likely to be Asian American or Pacific Islander, be nulliparous, have a higher education, receive influenza vaccination prenatally, and give birth at term. ASD was diagnosed in 1341 (1.6 percent) children, and the incidence rate was 3.78 per 1000 person years in the Tdap exposed and 4.05 per 1000 person years in the unexposed group (HR: 0.98, 95 percent confidence interval: 0.88-1.09). The inverse probability of treatment weighting-adjusted analyses revealed that prenatal Tdap vaccination was not associated with an increased ASD risk (HR: 0.85, 95 percent confidence interval: 0.77-0.95).

"Conclusions. Prenatal Tdap vaccination was not associated with an increased ASD risk. We support recommendations to vaccinate pregnant women to protect infants, who are at highest risk of death after pertussis infection."

The study controlled for major known confounding factors related to Tdap vaccination and ASD. However, the study was restricted to mother's giving birth to their 1st child. Also, although the average follow-up time was 4.4 years in the unvaccinated, and 3.9 years in the vaccinated, ASD may not have been captured in children born later in the course of the study having less than 3 years of follow-up. Based on US representative data, 3 to 5 years of age is the period when most children with an ASD are diagnosed. The authors suggest future studies with additional birth years and longer follow-up can add to the scientific evidence about Tdap vaccination during pregnancy and ASD in offspring. - Mod.ML
