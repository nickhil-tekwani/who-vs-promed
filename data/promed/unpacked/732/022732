WHO update number 148
---------------------
Summary
-------
- Influenza activity in the temperate regions of the northern
hemisphere remains at low levels, with sporadic influenza activity
reported in Canada and some European countries.
- Significant influenza activity was reported in only a few countries
of the tropical zone including Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Brazil in
the Americas, Cameroon in central Africa, and Cambodia and Lao
People's Democratic Republic in South East Asia.
- Transmission in the temperate countries of the southern hemisphere
has returned to inter seasonal levels, with some persistence of
influenza A(H3N2) in Australia.
- In the USA limited human-to-human transmission of a novel influenza
A(H3N2) virus was detected with no further reported spread to date.

The influenza season has not yet begun in the northern hemisphere
temperate zone, though some sporadic influenza activity has been
reported in Canada. The majority of the countries in this zone
reported low or no influenza activity in recent weeks. Influenza
activity in Europe remains low overall; the Czech Republic, France,
Ireland, Norway, the Russian Federation, Spain, and Sweden have
reported sporadic influenza activity.

Countries in the tropical zone
------------------------------
Tropical countries of the Americas
Influenza activity in the tropical countries of the Americas is
generally low or decreasing with the exception of Costa Rica where
influenza A(H3N2) activity is increasing. In Nicaragua, transmission
of the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus that increased late September
[2011] has been decreasing for the 3rd consecutive week since its peak
in week 42 [30 Oct-5 Nov 2011]. Much lower numbers of influenza
A(H3N2) have also been detected in the country. Low-level transmission
of influenza A(H3N2) continues in El Salvador and Honduras after
peaking in September [2011]. In the tropical area of Brazil an
outbreak with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was reported in the city of Pedra
Branca, Ceara.

Sub-Saharan Africa
In sub-Saharan Africa, influenza transmission continues at low levels
with exception of Cameroon. Influenza type B transmission began in
June [2011] in Cameroon and appears to be declining overall since
peaking in early September. Transmission of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09,
which began about 6 weeks after influenza type B, appears to have
peaked in early November, coincident with a rise in A(H3N2)
detections. Sierra Leone has reported low level transmission of
influenza A(H3N2), and Senegal has reported low level transmission of
influenza type B after peaking in early November.

Tropical Asia
Influenza transmission in tropical Asia is active in localized areas.
The high level transmission of a mixture of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and
influenza type B in Cambodia and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in Lao
People's Democratic Republic reported in the end of October [2011]
continues, but seems to be decreasing. Viet Nam has continued to
report sustained transmission of mainly influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 for
most of the year, which seems now to be declining. Other countries of
southern Asia continue to report small numbers of both influenza
A(H3N2) and influenza type B.

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
South America
In the temperate regions of South America influenza transmission has
declined to inter-seasonal levels and the season appears to be largely
over. Low or no influenza transmission is reported in all countries

Southern Africa
South Africa experienced a 2nd peak of influenza transmission this
season [2011] between late August and late October of influenza type B
and A(H3N2), which followed an earlier peak of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09
in June. Transmission of all influenza viruses has declined to low
levels.

Australia, New Zealand and South Pacific
In Australia and New Zealand, influenza activity is now at
inter-seasonal levels. As was seen in the last year [2010],
inter-seasonal low level activity persists in Australia with low
detection of influenza type B, influenza type A (unsubtyped) and
A(H3N2).

Influenza transmission remains low or inapparent throughout most of
the temperate areas of the northern and southern hemispheres, apart
from some persistence of H3N2 virus infection in Australia. Sporadic
activity continues in parts of the tropical zone. No novel influenza
viruses have appeared so far and the seasonal vaccines appear
well-matched to the currently circulating viruses. A potential
exception may be the swine origin H3N2 reassortant virus recently
isolated in North America that appears to have a limited ability to
spread from person to person. - Mod.CP]
