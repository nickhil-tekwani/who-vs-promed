Circulation of Respiratory Viruses Among Pilgrims During the 2012 Hajj Pilgrimage
-----------------------------------------------
Abstract: The Hajj is the oldest and largest annual mass gathering in the world and may increase the risk of spread of respiratory viruses. We performed a prospective survey among a cohort of pilgrims departing from Marseille, France to Mecca in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) for the 2012 Hajj season. Nasal swabs were collected from participants and tested for 11 respiratory viruses by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.

Of 165 participants sampled before departing to the KSA, 8 (4.8 percent) were positive for at least one virus (5 rhinovirus, one influenza C, one adenovirus, and one enterovirus). 70 symptomatic pilgrims underwent additional nasal swabs during their pilgrimage in the KSA, of which 27 (38.6 percent) were positive for at least one virus (19 rhinovirus, 6 influenza A, one influenza C, one respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) B, one metapneumovirus, one adenovirus, and one enterovirus). This was significantly higher than the 4.8 percent who were positive before departing for the KSA (P less than .001). Of 154 pilgrims sampled before leaving the KSA, 17 (11 percent) were positive for at least one virus (13 rhinovirus, 3 adenovirus, 2 influenza B, and one enterovirus), which was also significantly higher than the percentage of positive pilgrims (4.8 percent), before departing for the KSA (P = .040).

This study suggests a rapid acquisition of respiratory viruses among pilgrims during their stay in the KSA, most notably rhinovirus, and highlights the potential of spreading these infections in the pilgrims' home countries upon their return.

[This survey of respiratory virus infections detected in pilgrims before participation in the 2012 pilgrimage, and the respiratory virus infections acquired in Saudi Arabia during the course of the pilgrimage, provides a glimpse of what might be expected in the 2013 and subsequent Hajj pilgrimages. Fortunately, the Hajj occurs during the northern hemisphere influenza inter-epidemic season, and influenza virus infection was relatively rare. The predominance of non-epidemic viruses in the pre-Hajj survey (such as influenza C and RSV B) is possibly not unexpected. Somewhat reassuringly, the predominant respiratory virus acquired during the course of the 2012 pilgrimage was the highly transmissible, but relative benign, rhinovirus. This knowledge should enable the medical authorities in Saudi Arabia to concentrate their attention on the less common but more hazardous infections, such as MERS-CoV. - Mod.CP
