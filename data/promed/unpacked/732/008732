Warning Issued on cholera outbreak
-----------------------------------
A countrywide cholera alert has been issued. Medical services
director James Nyikal confirmed, on Sun 5 Dec 2004, that he had
written to all 8 provincial medical officers, and their 71 district
counterparts, telling them to be on high alert.
Dr. Nyikal led top Ministry of Health (MOH) officials in assessing
the situation in an area along a stretch of the Nairobi-Mombasa
highway that has been hit by the disease. "We have written to the
Provincial Medical Officers of Health and copied the letters to all
medical officers in the districts urging them to treat the epidemic
as a national concern," he said. The director spoke, as 4 more
cholera patients were admitted to the Makindu sub-district hospital,
Mtito Andei health center and Suleiman Farooq Memorial medical
center, also in Mtito Andei.
Dr. Nyikal said that, by 5 Dec 2004, the disease had killed 3 people
since 22 Nov 2004, when it was 1st detected, while 153 cases had been
treated. The 4 patients, including a 2-year-old girl, were admitted,
as Dr. Nyikal and his team toured the area.
Dr. Nyikal said 3 teams have been set up to combat the outbreak. They
involve clinical, sanitary and health education teams. Area MP
Kalembe Ndile urged the government to move with speed and to deploy
extra health personnel to the region to contain the situation.
The director of Medical Services said the Ministry has directed that
all rivers, boreholes, dams and all water points in affected areas be
treated with chemicals.
A crackdown has been launched in all eating places in the affected
areas to ensure that sanitary standards are maintained. Dr. Nzioki
said 68 out of 162 hotels and restaurants inspected have been closed
for failing to meet minimum health standards.
Hotel workers were also examined. Out of the 82 examined, 18 were
banned from handling food. "They will only handle food after they are
re-examined later and found fit to do so," the MOH said.

-----------------------------------------------

Vladivostok, Nakhodka, Spassk-Dalny, and Ussuriisk, as well as in 4
