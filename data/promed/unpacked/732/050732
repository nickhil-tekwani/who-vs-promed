The total number of people who got food poisoning after they ate sushi rolls in different cafes of Empire of Pizza chain and sought medical assistance has reached 253, the Ministry of Health said. 60 of them remain in hospitals. Their condition is stable. The rest were discharged from hospitals after medical assistance.

After massive food poisoning in Bishkek, all cafes of Empire of Pizza chain were closed for the period of epidemiological investigation. Specialists of the State Sanitary and Epidemiological Center will check all public catering facilities across the country.

[No information is given regarding the type of symptoms that developed and the incubation period between the ingestion of the alleged food and the start of symptoms. Since sushi rolls were apparently involved, contamination with _Bacillus cereus_ and elaboration of its toxins is a possibility.

_B. cereus_ food poisoning is the general name used for the illness. However, the organism has 2 recognized types of foodborne illness: diarrheal and emetic. The emetic syndrome is caused by cereulide, a heat- and pH-stable peptide toxin. Consumption of food contaminated with this toxin may lead to emesis (vomiting) between 0.5 and 5 hours after ingestion. The symptoms of this illness mimic those of _Staphylococcus aureus_ food poisoning.

The diarrheal illness (more common in North America and Europe) is caused by a high molecular weight protein, while the emetic or vomiting type (commoner in Japan than the diarrheal type) of food poisoning is caused by a low molecular weight and heat-stable protein. In some outbreaks, there seems to be an overlap between the diarrheal and the emetic types of illness.

The symptoms of _B. cereus_ diarrheal type food poisoning include abdominal pain, watery diarrhea, rectal tenesmus (a feeling of constantly needing to pass stools despite an empty colon), moderate nausea that may accompany diarrhea, seldom vomiting, and no fever. Symptoms develop within 6-15 hours and can persist for 24 hours. This syndrome is rather mild and tends to mimic the symptoms of _Clostridium perfringens_ food poisoning. The diarrheal syndrome is caused by enterotoxins that are produced during the growth of _B. cereus_ in the small intestine.

Generally, symptoms are transient and mild, possibly contributing to underreporting. Large numbers of cells are needed to cause illness and can occur when the food product (often rice) is held at a temperature inadequate to prevent growth. Despite the illness's usually mild symptoms, fatalities have been described associated with liver failure (Mahler H, Pasi A, Kramer JK, et al: Fulminant liver failure in association with the emetic toxin of _Bacillus cereus_. N Engl J Med 1997; 336(16): 1142-8; http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199704173361604.)

Bishkek (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishkek) is the capital and largest city of Kyrgyzstan. Bishkek is also the administrative centre of the Chuy Region. The province surrounds the city, although the city itself is not part of the province but rather a province-level unit of Kyrgyzstan. It is also near the Kazakhstan-Kyrgyzstan border. - Mod.LL
