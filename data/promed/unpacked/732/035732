Madi Okollo District authorities are investigating a suspected outbreak of anthrax disease. This follows the death of 3 animals from a kraal in Payonga village, Panduku parish in Pawor Sub County. Walter Avaga, the assistant veterinary health officer in charge of Lower Madi County, says that the animals died suddenly after presenting with swollen abdomen. According to Avaga, the 2 most important measures to control this potential outbreak is for farmers to vaccinate their animals and the safe disposal of carcasses of the dead animals.

The Madi Okollo District veterinary officer Dr Charles Onzima appeals for calm, saying they have picked samples and submitted them to the Infectious Diseases Institute (IDI) and are waiting for the results. However, Robert Onenarach, the LCIII [Local Council III, a type of local administration in Uganda] chairperson, has blamed the persisting cases of the disease on the negligence of some residents who continue to defy instructions to bury carcasses of animals suspected to have died of the disease.

Anthrax is one of the endemic animal diseases in the West Nile region, something largely blamed on the porous borders, the wildlife reserves at the Nile belt, and the animals that were brought by the refugee community that was never examined. Most anthrax infections occur among animals, with occasional spread to humans. Human infections often result from handling and consuming the meat of infected livestock.

In February 2018, an anthrax outbreak was detected in Rhino Camp Sub County where 3 people were infected and 6 animals died. According to records from the Arua district veterinary department between March 2017 and August 2018, anthrax killed 1087 animals while 248 humans had also been infected.

[he best map I could find for this area of Uganda was for Paduku, to the west of Pawor. Pull back on this map and Pawor is close by (https://uganda.places-in-the-world.com/8081181-place-panduku.html). This is in the Northern Region of North West Uganda, bordered to the west by the Congo and to the north by South Sudan (https://bit.ly/3LuCFCA).

Anthrax is a chronic problem in this part of Uganda, as described in this report. Like all enzootic areas, it depends primarily on owner vaccination of their cattle, and as we know -- anthrax loves procrastinators.

Thanks to Mahmoud Orabi for the contribution. - Mod.MHJ
