Injured lion destroyed by zoo had feline BSE
----------------------------------------------
A lion who was destroyed by zookeepers after failing to recover from back
injuries was suffering from the feline equivalent of mad cow disease. A
post-mortem examination by the Ministry of Agriculture vet found that
12-year-old Major had feline spongiform encephalopathy.
Michael Thomas, the zoo manager, said "I would expect that it would have
had to come from Major eating part of a whole carcass because it is the
brain and spinal cord which carry the disease."
A Ministry of Agriculture spokesman said: "We are quite confident that
animals that have contracted spongiform encephalopathy had been infected
prior to feeding controls put into effect in the late 80s. Vets say there
will be one or 2 cases a year until the older animals die out."
