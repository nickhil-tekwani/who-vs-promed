Nigeria - lead poisoning kills 100 children in north
----------------------------------------------------
More than 100 children have died of lead poisoning in Nigeria in
recent weeks, health officials say. The number has been rising since
March 2010, when residents started digging illegally for gold in
areas with high concentrations of lead. The victims were from several
remote villages in the northern state of Zamfara.

A total of 163 out of 355 cases of poisoning have proved fatal, a
Nigerian health ministry official told Reuters. Dr Henry Akpan, the
health ministry's chief epidemiologist, said: "[The victims] were
digging for gold, but the areas also have large concentrations of
lead."

Health authorities have set up 2 camps in the area to treat people
who are suffering symptoms of lead poisoning.

Contaminated water?
-------------------
The deaths were discovered during the country's annual immunisation
programme, when officials realised there were virtually no children
in several remote villages in the northern state, says the BBC's
Abdullai Kaura Abubakar in Kaduna.

Villagers said the children had died of malaria and it was only when
a team from international aid agency _Medecins Sans Frontiers_ took
blood tests from local people that the high concentrations of lead
were discovered.

Zamfara State had recently employed a Chinese company to mine gold in
the area, adds our correspondent. But villagers had also attempted to
capitalise by digging for the precious metal themselves - an illegal
activity in Nigeria. It is likely locals became sick after lead
removed during the process of refining gold ore contaminated local
water systems, our correspondent says.

[Lead is a naturally occurring bluish-gray metal found in small
amounts in the earth's crust. Lead can be found in all parts of our
environment. Lead itself does not break down, but lead compounds are
changed by sunlight, air, and water. When lead is released to the
air, it may travel long distances before settling to the ground. Once
lead falls onto soil, it usually sticks to soil particles. Movement
of lead from soil into groundwater will depend on the type of lead
compound and the characteristics of the soil.

Lead is a heavy metal that can be toxic to living bodies, humans and
animals, in certain high levels. Lead can be found in paints on
houses, on pottery, and other objects. Lead can be found in water, in
air around smelters, and in such objects as batteries.

When lead enters the body, generally through ingestion but also
through inhalation from dust and lead smelters, it may be seen as a
lead line on the metaphysis of growing bones in radiographs.

Lead can be especially detrimental to children as many tissues are
growing and developing and lead is easy incorporated into those
cells. It may slow growth, cause hearing problems, hyperactivity and
behavior changes. Children with high lead burdens may have
neurological damage, including brain damage. This may present as
headaches or learning difficulties, muscle cramps, twitches or
spasms. It may be more severe, leading to seizures and death.

Adults may also suffer from lead poisoning. Adults may experience a
variety of neurological problems, among them, memory and
concentration problems. They may also have muscle and joint pain,
reproductive problems, and hypertension (high blood pressure). Adults
may also suffer from neurological problems as well.

Heavy metal intoxication almost always affects the gastrointestinal
system, such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, poor appetite and as a
consequence, weight loss. Anemia may also be seen in lead poisoning,
which further increases the weakness the victim experiences.

The effects of lead are the same whether it enters the body through
breathing or swallowing. Lead can affect almost every organ and
system in the body. The main target for lead toxicity is the nervous
system, both in adults and children. Long-term exposure of adults can
result in decreased performance in some tests that measure functions
of the nervous system. It may also cause weakness in fingers, wrists,
or ankles. Lead exposure also causes small increases in blood
pressure, particularly in middle-aged and older people and can cause
anemia. Exposure to high lead levels can severely damage the brain
and kidneys in adults or children and ultimately cause death. In
pregnant women, high levels of exposure to lead may cause
miscarriage. High-level exposure in men can damage the organs
responsible for sperm production.

Children are more vulnerable and more sensitive to lead poisoning
than adults. A child who swallows large amounts of lead may develop
blood anemia, severe stomachache, muscle weakness, and brain damage.
These same clinical signs mimic other childhood illness. If a child
swallows smaller amounts of lead, much less severe effects on blood
and brain function may occur. Even at much lower levels of exposure,
lead can affect a child's mental and physical growth.

Exposure to lead is more dangerous for young and unborn children.
Unborn children can be exposed to lead through their mothers. Harmful
effects include premature births, smaller babies, decreased mental
ability in the infant, learning difficulties, and reduced growth in
young children. These effects are more common if the mother or baby
was exposed to high levels of lead. Some of these effects may persist
beyond childhood.

Lead in the groundwater may be an issue in this case. Lead can be
absorbed from the drinking water. In the US, the level of lead in the
water is allowed at less than 0.15 ml of lead per liter of water
(less than 0.15 ppm). A number of water filtration units such as
reverse osmosis can filter out the lead. If the situation is more
primitive than this, I am unsure what to treat a well with. Calcium
disodium EDTA has been used to treat people, and putting it into a
water well may work to bind it, but I have no data support. Certainly
using a water system that is not contaminated with lead is the best
option.

If this is a case of lead in the air, then it is appropriate to cover
the mouth and nose and to remove one's self from the area.

Lead has no known physiological function in the body. It can be
tested for in the blood, but chelators are necessary to help
eliminate the metal from the body. Effective chelators include
dimercapterol and succimer.
