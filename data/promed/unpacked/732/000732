K-Fat Inc., Brooklyn, NY is recalling "Golden Dragon Fish brand
Frozen Cooked Mackerel Fish" because the product was found to be
uneviscerated prior to processing. It was discovered by New York
State Department of Agriculture and Markets Food Inspectors during a
routine inspection.

This product may be contaminated with _Clostridium botulinum_ spores,
which can cause botulism, a serious and potentially fatal food-borne illness.

The sale of this type of fish is prohibited under New York State
Agriculture and Markets regulations because _Clostridium botulinum_
spores are more likely to be concentrated in the viscera than any
other portion of the fish. Uneviscerated fish has been linked to
outbreaks of botulism poisoning.

The recalled "Golden Dragon Fish brand Frozen Cooked Mackerel Fish"
comes in an uncoded 250G plastic bag and basket and is a product of
Vietnam. "Golden Dragon Fish brand Frozen Cooked Mackerel Fish" was
sold in New York and New Jersey.

No illnesses have been reported to date in connection with this problem.

Consumers who have "Golden Dragon Fish brand Frozen Cooked Mackerel
Fish" are advised not to eat it, and return it to the place of purchase.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts
such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases
associated with the food. Most of the food recalls are related to
defective preparation procedures, which could, but not necessarily
do, result in the germination of viable spores of _C. botulinum_.

With fish like this, many recalls are related to the lack of
evisceration. - Mod.LL
