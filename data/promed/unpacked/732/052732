The flap in "Unexplained deaths, canines - USA (multistate) (02)"
(20050519.1371) was necessary. This recurring problem, in ProMED postings
and elsewhere, is the result of sloppy usage. You are not alone if you use
the word "flu" for just about everything except paralytic diseases, but you
are not correct. Dengue and scores of other illnesses have been described
as "a mild flu-like illness". Those who define an illness as such likely
have never had one.
Athletes taking a day or 2 off usually are described as having "the flu",
which means they have diarrhea from eating too much or poorly, have a
hangover, or have a headache and a fever. Had they had influenza, they
would not be back on the field or court or rink within a day or 2, as
anyone who has had influenza can attest.
When describing hantaviral infections, it is frequently said that the
patient had "flu-like symptoms". Influenza ("flu") is clinically diagnosed
as a combination of fever, myalgias, and malaise plus cough and nasal
discharge, but patients with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome do not manifest
upper respiratory symptoms early in their illnesses. When a patient with
hantavirus pulmonary syndrome begins to cough, it is because of pulmonary
edema. Therefore, a patient with fever, myalgias, and malaise _without_
cough and nasal discharge do not have "a flu-like illness without cough and
nasal discharge"; they have something else.
The taxonomy of Influenza A virus, a prime cause of influenza (or, if one
must, "flu"), is a member of the family _Orthomyxoviridae_, genus
_Influenzavirus A_. Period. Proper communication requires proper usage of
terms and, one would hope, more exacting terms than are used by athletes,
lay periodicals, and other forms of mass communication. Calling everything
under the sun "flu" is a disservice to everyone, whether the subject is a
dog, a horse, a chicken, a human, or any other vertebrate.
The best resolution is to never use the term "flu" at all but, instead, use
the appropriate word or term, whatever that may be.

I also had questions about just what was meant by the term "canine flu".
Apparently the term has been used in dog show circles to refer to
campylobacter infections, also nicknamed "dog show crud". A Google search
certainly doesn't necessarily lead to all scientific information, but it
frequently leads to the source of some questionable terminology. Since the
article in question refers to a respiratory infection, it is obviously not
referring to campylobacter, but the fact remains that the term "flu" is
thrown about rather carelessly.

[Both Charlie Calisher and Woody Fraser are appropriately pointing out the
difficulties caused by the loose application of the word "flu" to diseases
and syndromes not caused by an influenza virus, the "true" etiology of
"flu". The popular term "influenza-like illness" (ILI) is being used in
syndromic surveillance (another popular term these days), usually defined
as an illness with fever, malaise, myalgias (muscle pains), headache, and
respiratory symptoms. The term is useful during the influenza season in
following the order of magnitude of the disease burden in a population when
broad testing for the influenza virus is neither feasible nor
practical. It is also useful as a signal for the need to obtain laboratory
confirmation in some cases, in order to identify the specific influenza
virus in circulation.
Unfortunately the general public and the press have taken to using the term
flu for any illness/syndromic presentation that includes fever and malaise,
irrespective of the presence of respiratory symptoms. Obviously, this
leads to confusion, with the potential of misrepresenting the true etiology
of an outbreak.
That being said, we at ProMED-mail have learned that the lay press is a
good source of early warnings. For many different reasons, reports on
outbreaks are often first disseminated through the lay press. The formal
health sector often first learns of these outbreaks through these press
reports, which serve as alerts to a problem that may require further
investigation.
Press reports do not always contain scientifically precise information, but
do present a general impression provided by the affected community and the
individual reporter. We at ProMED-mail have learned (but sometimes forget)
that if we do not "correct" these scientific imperfections, our subscribers
will -- reminding us to exercise more vigorous editing. - Mod.MPP]
