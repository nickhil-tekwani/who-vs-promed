Cases of leptospirosis have been reported in people who have practiced canyoning activities on the Argensou at Auzat and Vicdessos in Ariege. The ARS [Agence Regionale de Sante (Regional Health Agency)] calls on people who have practiced swimming or fishing activities in this sector to consult their doctor quickly in the event of symptoms.

To date [10 Sep 2021], around 10 cases are confirmed or probable and have been reported to the ARS. Health professionals in the sector were made aware and the site was closed as soon as the first case was confirmed.

7 cases of leptospirosis have been confirmed, and 6 other suspected cases are currently under investigation. This is the report established by the Regional Health Agency ARS [Agence Regionale de Sante] of Occitanie on Fri 10 Sep 2021, after an alert from professionals of whitewater sports activities. Laura Catala, a doctor at the ARS, specifies that the health authorities were "informed by the manager of a canyoning company in Ariege of the symptoms experienced by some of her clients following the practice of the activity or swimming in the Argensou stream."

The high mountain gendarmerie platoon [PGHM, police department] of Ariege (09) call on regular or occasional swimmers to be vigilant. "Leptospirosis alert", they relay in a message published on Thu 9 Sep 2021 on social networks. In case of fever observed several days after swimming in fresh water in the Auzat sector, it is recommended to approach the ARS.

A local resident immediately reacted to the message the gendarmes [police] posted on social networks. He reminded Internet users not to take this warning lightly. His son was hospitalized for 5 days following a swim precisely at Ger Bridge in mid-August [2021]. This testimony led to other comments, such as this one: "It scares people, all the kids in the valley bathe there".

Steps have been taken to avoid new cases. Since 1 Sep 2021, swimming, canyoning and water consumption are prohibited along the Argensou river in the town of Auzat.

Leptospirosis, also called "rat disease", is a disease of animal origin. It is transmissible to humans, mainly indirectly. Initially known as "occupational disease of sewer workers" or even breeders, veterinarians or slaughterhouse staff, today it is mainly associated with aquatic recreation in freshwater, near muddy banks.

Not all leptospires (or bacteria) present in the environment are pathogenic. The germs responsible for the disease are those carried by infected animals which emit them in their urine. Leptospires enter the body through wounds, skin lesions or mucous membranes.

Leptospirosis begins with a high fever with chills, headache, muscle pain and joint pain. The disease is usually mild but can progress to serious or even fatal forms. It is possible that it causes hemorrhagic, hepatic, meningeal or pulmonary damage, or acute renal failure. Neurological manifestations with convulsions up to coma can also be observed. We can also observe a multivisceral involvement, that is to say of all the organs. Hence the importance of early diagnosis.

The diagnosis of the disease, which can be confused with others, can be difficult. Indeed, some symptoms can make one think of those of the flu ... or those of COVID-19. This flu-like form of the disease is also the most common. It is therefore important to report to your doctor if you had swum in freshwater preceding the first symptoms.

The incubation period of the disease ranges from 4 days to 2 weeks. In order to facilitate the diagnosis, ARS Occitanie communicated with general practitioners, the infectious diseases department of hospitals, the Toulouse University Hospital and fishing federations.

It is important not to bathe when the skin has skin lesions. It is an open door to the bacteria. It is also essential to respect the measures prohibiting bathing in freshwater. If you develop fevers after swimming in freshwater, contact your doctor without delay and get in touch with the Regional Health Agency [ARS] in your region. The ARS insists on the importance of an early diagnosis in order to be able to treat with antibiotics and stop the progression of the disease.

[ProMED thanks Dr Mahmoud Orabi for this submission.

A discussion of leptospirosis can be found in the moderator comments in the prior ProMED post on this outbreak (Leptospirosis - France: (LP) watersports, Argensou canyon, alert 20210818.8602811)

Auzat is a small village in the Ariege department in the Occitanie region of southwestern France (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariège_(department)). Vicdessos is a former commune in the Ariege department that was merged into a new commune, Val-de-Sos, 2 km (1.2 mi) east of Auzat (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicdessos). Argensou is a small canyon 12 km (7.5 mi) northeast of Auzat. A map showing the location of Auzat, Val-de-Sos and Argensou canyon can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Speleo+Canyon+Ariege+:+canyoning+en+Ariège,+Route+de,+La+Vexane,+09400+Niaux,+France/Auzat,+09220,+France. A description of its tourist activities can be found at https://speleo-canyon-ariege.com/produit/canyon-de-largensou and https://www.adrenactive.com/canyoning-toulouse-canyon-argensou-5785.htm.

The second news report above shows a photo of nutria (aka coypu, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coypu), a semiaquatic rodent, which the news report says "is one of the animals that can be a vector of leptospirosis. It frequently travels along muddy banks where the bacteria causing the disease may be present." In addition, some of the countryside of Ariege is pastoral, with "cows and sheep ... brought to the high mountains (of Ariege) for summer grazing, as are herds of native Merens horses" (https://www.ariege.com/en/discover-ariege/agro-pastoralism). These animals can be carriers of the bacterium _Leptospira_, the cause of leptospirosis, in their urine, which can contaminate streams, where tourists are exposed while engaging in various watersports. A similar outbreak of leptospirosis in tourists engaged in watersports in streams in the Golan Heights occurred in 2018 and was reported by ProMED at the time (see posts listed below). - Mod.ML
