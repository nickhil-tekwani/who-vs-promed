Information received on 19 Aug 2008 from Dr Moshe Chaimovitz,
Director, Veterinary Services and Animal Health, Ministry of
Agriculture and Rural Development, BEIT DAGAN, Israel

Summary
Report type: Immediate notification
Start date: 15 Jun 2008
Date of 1st confirmation of the event: 10 Jul 2008
Report date: 19 Aug 2008
Date submitted to OIE: 19 Aug 2008
Reason for notification: Unexpected increase in morbidity or
mortality of a listed disease

Summary description: In June 2008, the disease was reported in a
dairy herd in a group of 1st-time calvers. Initial clinical signs
were fever, loss of appetite and an abrupt drop in milk yield
followed a few days later by diarrhea which was sometimes bloody. At
the same time, cases of pneumonia appeared in young calves located in
a distant shed on the farm. This is the 1st record of severe acute
bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) infection in Israel, with
involvement of genotype 2.

The herd comprises 350 Israeli Holstein-Friesian dairy cows and 300
heifers. The farm also raises male calves which are bought from 5
other dairy herds at one week of age and has a feedlot of mixed beef
breed calves which are bought from several sources, 1100 calves altogether.

The herd was not vaccinated against BVDV. Serum was harvested from
convalescent cows, filtered, supplemented with antibiotics and used
for passive immunization of calves.

Clinical manifestation and disease progression: Clinical signs of
enteritis 1st appeared in one pen of the adult cows (1st-time
calvers), but gradually spread to other groups over a period of 6
weeks, eventually affecting at least 30 percent of the adult herd.
The course of disease in non-fatal cases was about 2 weeks until
recovery. At the same time, dairy calves between 10 days and 3 months
suffered from severe pneumonia without diarrhea. Only calves born on
the farm and from another dairy farm died, whereas calves from the
other 4 farms were not severely affected. Clinical signs were not
observed in older milk breed calves and in the beef breeds. During
June and July 2008, 79 cows and calves died or were removed from the
farm. The farmer has reported a reduced conception rate during the
outbreak. Sequencing identified the isolate from the cow's intestine
as BVDV2. Morbidity and mortality have abated in the adults but
continue in the young calves. The herd will be monitored for
consequences of fetal infection and ear notch testing for PI
(persistently infected) offspring will be implemented.

[ProMED-mail apologies for the delay in posting this information,
which was kindly sent by Dr. Michel Bellaiche in Israel. While we do
not usually carry information on BVD as it is in endemic in most
parts of the world, this OIE report is noteworthy because it is the
1st time that genotype 2 has been associated with a severe, acute
outbreak of BVD in Israel.

Stokka et al. in a Kansas State University Extension bulletin
summarize the occurrence and importance of BVD as follows: Bovine
virus diarrhea (BVD) is one of the most significant viral infections
of cattle. BVD was 1st recognized as a disease syndrome in 1946.
Today, 70 to 90 percent of the world's cattle population are
seropositive for BVD. There are at least 2 genotypes, type 1 and type
2; and 2 biotypes, cytopathic and noncytopathic. Both type 1 and type
2 genotypes have cytopathic and noncytopathic biotypes as members;
and both type 1 and type 2 genotypes have many different strains,
some of which are more deadly than others. Recently, the type 2
genotype has caused many of the most severe cases of BVD. For further
information, please see
