Outbreak of anthrax in Osh region
-------------------------------------
In Osh region, Alayskiy district, in the village Josholu, 6 people were
hospitalized from 5 to 7 Sep 2005. These 6 people were participating in the
slaughter of an ill cow. All 6 were diagnosed with cutaneous anthrax with
involvement of the upper extremities. 11 people in total were participating
in the cow's slaughter. Currently, people that were in contact are under
preventive care. A soil sample has been taken for laboratory testing from
the slaughter location.

[Kyrgystan has modest numbers of livestock cases but a constant ratio of
about 10:1 human to livestock cases -- much like the situation in Central
Africa -- with official numbers prior to 2000 of some 30 to 70 human cases
a year; only 4 human cases were officially reported in 2001. This is not a
new problem in Osh; there were 32 human cases in 1999 and 73 in 1997. -
