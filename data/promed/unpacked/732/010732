-----------------------------------------------------------------

Subject: _Streptococcus agalactiae_ [Group B streptococcus] ST283, which caused a foodborne outbreak of invasive sepsis in Singapore in 2015, is widespread in humans and aquaculture in South East Asia.

Background: In 2015, Singapore had the 1st reported foodborne outbreak caused by the group B streptococcus (GBS) _Streptococcus agalactiae_. It was sequence type (ST) 283, acquired from fish, and, remarkably, affected adults without co-morbidities. Previously, ST283 had only been reported from humans in Hong Kong and one fish in Thailand.

Results of a literature review and a survey of ST238 amongst opportunistic GBS collections show that GBS ST283 accounted for 29/38 (76 per cent) invasive GBS in Lao PDR (2000-2017), 102/139 (73 per cent) in Thailand (2007-2015), 4/13 (31 per cent) in Vietnam (2015-2017), and 21/331 (6 per cent) and 146/408 (36 per cent) in Singapore (2001-2010 and 2011-2015 respectively). Only 4 cases of ST283 were reported outside Asia (2002-2017). ST283 and its variants were found in 7 fish species in Singapore markets (2015), a diseased frog in China (2014), and 68/68 (100 per cent) diseased tilapia from 14 sites in Malaysia (2007-2008 and 2018) and Vietnam (2016). Genomic analysis showed that ST283 is monophyletic and predicted it emerged in 1984, coinciding with the regional expansion of aquaculture.

Our interpretation is that ST283 is causing invasive sepsis in adult humans, and disease in farmed aquatic animals, in parts of SE Asia. Transmission routes have not been studied but the foodborne route, via consumption of raw fish, as in the Singapore outbreak, is suspected. ST283 poses a potential hazard to food security and public health in countries expanding aquaculture.

Prior ProMED-mail posts (Strep. Group B - Singapore: serotype III, ST283, invasive, foodborne, fish, 2015 20171116.5448535, Strep. Group B - Singapore: foodborne susp. RFI 20150715.3513331 and Strep. Group B - Singapore (02): fish susp, RFI 20150814.3577512) reported an outbreak of invasive infections due to group B Streptococcus (GBS, also called _Streptococcus agalactiae_) serotype III sequence type (ST) 283 that sickened 238 people in Singapore in 2015. This outbreak was linked to consumption of GBS-contaminated raw fish in "yusheng", a popular dish at hawker centers (food courts), where raw fish is marinated in sesame oil and garnished with red chili and ginger. The dish typically is made from 2 freshwater fish species, Asian bighead carp and snakehead.

GBS are Gram positive cocci that produce beta-hemolysis when cultured on sheep blood agar. They are classified into several serotypes based on the antigenic specificity of their capsular polysaccharide. GBS colonize the vagina and gastrointestinal tract in healthy women, with carriage rates ranging from 15-45 per cent and can cause chorioamnionitis, post-partum endometritis, and sepsis in pregnant women and pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis in newborns following vaginal delivery in mothers with vaginal GBS colonization at the time of delivery.

GBS have been found to colonize the urethra in both men and women and can also colonize the gastrointestinal tract and upper respiratory tract; they are increasingly recognized as an invasive pathogen in diabetics and the elderly, causing sepsis, pneumonia, skin and soft-tissue infection (such as, decubitus ulcers and diabetic foot infections), urinary tract infections, endocarditis, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, meningitis, peritonitis, and endophthalmitis (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/41/6/839.long).

GBS are also found in other animals including fish, cattle, horses, dogs, rabbits, guinea pigs, and mice. The strains that cause disease in humans, however, were said to be usually biochemically, metabolically or serologically different from strains that cause disease in other animals (http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/streptococcosis.pdf). However, GBS MLST ST-283, serotype III-4 with similar genotypes has been detected both in fish and in adult humans with invasive GBS diseases in Southeast Asia, which suggested that there may be an epidemiological connection between the 2 host species, as previously described for a closely related streptococcal species, _Streptococcus iniae_ (http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/13/41). This epidemiologic connection has now been established in the Singapore outbreak (1-4).
