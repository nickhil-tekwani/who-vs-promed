A measles outbreak in Chaman [Killa Abdullah District, Balochistan] has left 3 children of a family dead, ARY News reported on Sunday [17 Jan 2021].

According to the levies sources, the measles outbreak is being reported in several villages of Tooba Achakzai in Chaman.

Acting on the situation, District Health Officer, Rafique Mengal has sent special teams to the infected areas to control the epidemic.

Measles is a highly contagious infectious disease caused by the measles virus. Symptoms usually develop 10-12 days after exposure to an infected person and last 7-10 days.

Symptoms
Initial symptoms typically include fever, often greater than 40 deg C (104 deg F), cough, runny nose, and inflamed eyes. Small white spots known as Koplik's spots may form inside the mouth 2 or 3 days after the start of symptoms.

A red, flat rash which usually starts on the face and then spreads to the rest of the body typically begins three to five days after the start of symptoms.

Common complications include diarrhea (in 8% of cases), middle ear infection (7%), and pneumonia (6%).

Prevention
Mothers who are immune to measles pass antibodies to their children while they are still in the womb, especially if the mother acquired immunity through infection rather than vaccination.

Such antibodies will usually give newborn infants some immunity against measles, but these antibodies are gradually lost over the course of the 1st 9 months of life.

[ARY News reported on 11 Jan 2021 that 5 children suffering from measles died in Kali Taki, an area of Chaman, Balochistan (https://arynews.tv/en/five-children-die-measles-chaman/). Taken together with these latest deaths, there are now at least 8.

"Measles infected nearly 10 million people in 2018 and killed 140 000, mostly children, as devastating outbreaks of the viral disease hit every region of the world (World Health Organization).

In figures described by its director general as "an outrage", the WHO said most of [2018] measles deaths were in children under 5 years old who had not been vaccinated.

The picture for 2019 is even worse, the WHO said, with provisional data up to November showing a 3-fold increase in case numbers compared with the same period in 2018. [According to UN News, the death toll in 2019 was 50% higher than a historic low reached in 2016, and all WHO regions saw an increase in cases, adding up to a global total of 869 770].

The United States reported its highest number of measles cases in 25 years in 2019, while 4 countries in Europe -- Albania, the Czech Republic, Greece, and Britain -- lost their WHO "measles-free" status in 2018 after suffering large outbreaks.

An outbreak in the South Pacific nation of Samoa has infected more than 4200 people and killed more than 60, mostly babies and children, in a battle complicated by a vocal anti-vaccination movement.

In 2018, measles hit hardest in Liberia, Ukraine, Democratic Republic of Congo, Madagascar, and Somalia, the WHO said, with these 5 nations accounting for nearly half of all cases worldwide.

Globally, measles vaccination rates have stagnated for almost a decade. The WHO and the UNICEF children's fund say that in 2018, around 86% of children got a 1st dose of measles vaccine through routine vaccination plans, and fewer than 70% got the 2nd dose recommended to fully protect them." (https://arynews.tv/en/who-measles-kills-140000/ from 6 Dec 2019)

"Public health experts said the soaring numbers are the consequence of years of insufficient vaccination coverage. They worry that the [COVID-19] pandemic will exacerbate the spread of measles, a disease that is even more contagious than Covid-19.

"We are worried that there are new gaps in immunity opening because of COVID on top of those that were already there," said Dr Natasha Crowcroft, senior technical adviser for measles and rubella at the WHO. "We can't carry on in the same way and expect a different result," she added, calling for more resources and creative applications of them."
