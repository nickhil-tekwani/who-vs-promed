Exports as well as domestic markets earn top dollars for shrimp farmers, and the spread of white spot syndrome (WSS) and the resultant death of shrimp in large numbers have created panic among farmers. The spread of WSS was 1st spotted in 40-50 day old shrimp of "Kara" breed in Paravoor, Kottuvalli, Varappuzha and Ezhikkara regions [Ernakulam district, Kerala state].

Fearing the outbreak of WSS, farmers are now bringing even shrimp, which are not yet fully grown, to the market, but they are unable to attract even 1/3rd of the normal market rate. Unless they are fully-grown, shrimp cannot be exported also, putting farmers in a dilemma. The outbreak of WSS was 1st revealed after the examination of the shrimp samples conducted at Panangad Fisheries College under the aegis of Kerala Aqua Farmers Federation. There are no effective preventive measures to check the outbreak of WSS.

Further examination of shrimp samples revealed the outbreak of the virus in farms located in southern regions of Thrippunithara, Kumbalangi and Chellanam [Kerala state], Kerala Aqua Farmers Federation state secretary K X Sebastian said.

Shrimp affected by WSS will have a mixture of red and yellow colours and will float en masse to the periphery of the farms and drop dead within 24 hours. To prevent the spread of WSS to other shrimp in the farms, farmers are now trying to remove the dead shrimp from the farms. Farmers had earlier avoided routing lake water in some shrimp farms, fearing that shrimp from lakes were spreading the outbreak, but WSS outbreak has spread in such farms also.

Shrimp for farming is provided to farmers through the Agency for Development of Aquaculture (ADAC). ADAC authorities claim that shrimp is thoroughly checked before distribution to ensure that it doesn't have any contagious diseases. But detection of WSS in the present lot of shrimp provided by ADAC has disproved such claims.

Farmers who apply are provided shrimp free of cost. The government also bears a huge sum as insurance to protect the shrimp farmers. But insurance claims of shrimp farmers are sent back, [the government] citing various technicalities. The Kerala Aqua Farmers Federation plans to approach the district deputy director against this.

[White spot viral disease has caused high mortalities and severe damage to the shrimp culture industry in China, Thailand, Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia and India. The white spot disease virus is believed to have been transmitted through seed brought to India clandestinely from South East Asian countries, where the virus has been amplified before.

Acutely affected shrimps are reported to show a rapid reduction in food consumption, become lethargic and have a loose cuticle with white spots (hence the name "white spot" disease) of 0.5 to 2.0 mm in diameter, which are more apparent on the inside surface of the carapace. The white spots represent abnormal deposits of calcium salts by the cuticular epidermis.
