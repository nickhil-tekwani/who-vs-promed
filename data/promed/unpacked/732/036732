One positive result for sapovirus infection has been confirmed at Gisborne Hospital. Tairawhiti District Health Medical Officer of Health Dr Geoffrey Cramp said further results were needed but at this stage the result indicated [a] sapovirus was the cause of the gastroenteritis outbreak at this hospital last week [week of 25 Nov 2013]. Sapovirus [infection] is a diarrhoeal gastroenteritis similar to norovirus [infection], but milder. All results so far were negative for norovirus, he said. There have been only 2 new cases -- both staff members -- at the weekend [30 Nov-1 Dec 2013] and 5 patients were in isolation as of this morning [2 Dec 2013].

Over the weekend, hospital staff worked to isolate cases and to use personal protection when entering their rooms. It looked like the precautionary measures taken had helped to bring the outbreak under control, said Dr Cramp. The public are still advised to limit visits to the hospital unless it is "absolutely essential" and to avoid bringing young children or people with low immunity to the hospital.

Staff who were affected by the virus should not return to work until 48 hours after being clear of symptoms, he said. Hand washing was imperative. He said prospective visitors should make use of the hand sanitiser dispensers available at key entry points to the hospital.

[The highly contagious noroviruses are responsible for most gastroenteritis outbreaks in institutional settings, on cruise ships, and in schools. However, a subset of viral gastroenteritis outbreaks in which norovirus is not detected may be due to viruses such as astroviruses, adenoviruses, or rotavirus. Sapovirus, a pathogen discovered in 1977 from the same family as norovirus (_Caliciviridae_), is an underappreciated but important cause of norovirus-negative outbreaks.

The family _Caliciviridae_ contains 5 genera _Sapovirus_, _Nebovirus_, _Norovirus_, _Lagovirus_, and _Vesivirus_, which include Sapovirus (SaV), Newbury-1 virus, Norwalk virus (NoV), Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), and Feline calicivirus (FCV), respectively. SaV is a causative agent of (usually) mild gastroenteritis in children and adults. SaV can be divided into 5 genogroups (GI-GV), among which GI, GII, GIV, and GV are known to infect humans, whereas SaV GIII infects only porcine species.

Sapovirus was first detected in 1977 as the cause of a gastroenteritis outbreak in a home for infants in Sapporo, Japan, and was thereafter reported primarily among young children with acute gastroenteritis. After sapovirus diagnostic RT-PCR was developed, sapovirus outbreaks were discovered in long-term care facilities for the elderly.

Gisborne is a city in northeastern New Zealand and the largest settlement in the Gisborne Region. It has a population of around 34 800, and is named after an early Colonial Secretary William Gisborne.
