Tilapia Syncytial Hepatitis, Israel
---------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 21 May 2017 from Dr Nadav Galon, Director, Veterinary Services and Animal Health, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, BET DAGAN, Israel

Summary
Report type: Immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 1 Aug 2011
Date of confirmation of the event: 1 Mar 2014
Report date: 21 May 2017
Date submitted to OIE: 21 May 2017
Reason for notification: emerging disease
Morbidity: 6 percent
Mortality 2 percent
Zoonotic impact: No
Causal agent: Tilapia lake virus

New outbreaks (1)
Outbreak 1 (Kineret outbreak), Kineret Lake, Kineret, Hazafon
Date of start of the outbreak: 1 Aug 2011
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Lake
Water type: Fresh water
Population type: wild
Production system: open
Affected animals
Species / Morbidity / Mortality
tilapins (Tilapia) / 1 (scale 0 to 5) / 0.5 (scale 0 to 5)

Affected population: The disease was identified in wild tilapia fish populations in the Kineret Lake. The major symptoms were lethargy, skin erosions, and ocular lesions. Main pathological changes were syncytial hepatitis (all ages) and central nervous system involvement (found mainly in adults). Several outbreaks of the disease affecting cultured tilapins were also recorded.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: Tilapia lake virus (TiLV) outbreaks are recorded mostly during the hot season (July-October). Outbreaks occurring in other periods are rare. In aquaculture systems, morbidity and mortality includes fish over 50 grams, although involvement of small fish is not excluded.

[This emerging viral disease of Tilapia fish, observed in Lake Tiberias (aka Kinneret Lake, Sea of Galilee, Lake of Gennesaret) in 2011, has since been subject to international, cooperative research. (20150127.3122740 and Refs 1, 2).

In view of its economical and international impacts it has now been recognised as an emerging disease according to OIE's criteria, and consequently notified as such to the OIE.

OIE's maps do not present the lake; to view its location, see map at http://tinyurl.com/kp5xpz2.

The Tilapia Lake virus has, by now, been reportedly detected in Tilapia fish in 2 continents: Asia (Israel) and America (Ecuador, Colombia) and regarded "an emerging global scourge to tilapiine aquaculture which is a multi-billion dollar industry" (Ref 3).
