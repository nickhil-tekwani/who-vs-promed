Plague Hits Arua
---------------
In Arua district [Uganda, 3 people have so far died of plague and 4
others are undergoing treatment. This was disclosed by the health
inspector of Vurra sub-county, Santos Angwalia, recently while
briefing the Resident District Commissioner, Thomas Okot Nyalulu, on
the epidemic.
Santos said the areas bordering the DR Congo in Vurra county had
registered a number of plague cases. He said his office was trying to
sensitize the population on how to take precautions. He said the
disease could be prevented by practising good hygiene.
He called upon residents to clear bushes and to store food safely [to
discourage wild rodents. Meanwhile, in Nebbi district [Uganda, the
disease, which was reported last month, has so far claimed 15 lives
and affected 40 people according to the District Director of Health
Services, Dr Sam Orach.

[This article mentions the plague outbreak extending to the area
bordering with the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). We have it
from a reliable source that there has been an ongoing outbreak of
plague in the DRC (see ProMED-mail posting of 11 Oct 2001, ref.
above). Further information on the details of this plague outbreak
would be very much appreciated. - Mod.MPP
[There are 3 clinical types of plague: bubonic, pneumonic, and
septicemic. When not otherwise specified, as in this case, plague
outbreaks are usually of the bubonic type. - Mod.JW
