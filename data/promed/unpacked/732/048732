[In their final report submitted to the OIE, the Italian animal health authorities have updated the number of birds destroyed. Based on the information found in the WAHID summary, the 6 outbreaks that were reported have been resolved. The total number of animals affected in those 6 outbreaks was: 952 658 susceptible, 151 863 cases, 5676 dead, and 946 982 destroyed. For all 6 outbreaks HPAI virus subtype H7N7 was confirmed.

This and additional data on this event can also be found at the WAHID database at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/Immsummary
(Note: to view the information on HPAI, you need to scroll down to the name of the disease).

Avian influenza (AI) is a zoonosis (a disease which primarily affects animals, but causes disease in humans). AI viruses are highly species-specific, but have, on rare occasions, crossed the species barrier to infect humans. Transmission to humans has occurred when there is close contact with infected birds or heavily contaminated environments.

While AI caused by highly pathogenic virus strains have sometimes been shown to infect man, this disease should not be confused with seasonal human influenza, a very common human disease (generally caused by H1 and H3 viruses).

Due to the potential for human infection, it is recommended that those people working with, or in contact with poultry suspected of being infected with AI, wear protective clothing including facemasks, goggles, gloves, and boots.

The probability for the AI virus to change to a form that is highly infectious for humans and that will spread readily from person to person is unknown.

There is no evidence to suggest that the consumption of cooked poultry or eggs could transmit the AI virus to humans (http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Media_Center/docs/pdf/Disease_cards/AI-EN.pdf).

According to the information provided by the Italian animal health authorities, all workers taking part in depopulation measures on infected premises applied strict prevention procedures and wore protective clothing (overalls, rubber gloves, boots, turbo ventilated masks with FP3 filter, etc.) They were regularly checked for symptoms of AI infection.

However, during this event despite high biosecurity measures taken, 3 cases of H7N7 human infection were identified in 3 workers who took part in stamping out procedures on outbreaks 1 and 2:
- 28 Aug 2013: 1st human case of conjunctivitis
- 31 Aug 2013: 2nd case of conjunctivitis and ILI (influenza-like illness)
- 4 Sep 2013: 3rd case of conjunctivitis
- No human-to-human transmission
