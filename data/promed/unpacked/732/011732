Wales' Rural Affairs minister Elin Jones has today [27 Mar 2011] laid
the Badger (Control Area) (Wales) Order 2011, which authorises the
destruction of badgers in a specific area of West Wales known as the
Intensive Action Area as part of the Welsh Assembly Government's
programme to eradicate bovine tuberculosis (TB).

The minister has also announced new controls to deal with TB in
non-bovines, which include camelids, goats, and deer.

Commenting on the development, Harvey Locke, president of the British
Veterinary Association [BVA], said:

"The BVA believes that failure to tackle wildlife sources of TB
infection has prolonged the presence of the disease in all affected
species populations. We therefore welcome today's [27 Mar 2011]
announcement by the Welsh Assembly Government and hope that it will
progress without further delay.

"We hope this action in Wales will focus attention on what is
happening in England as we await Defra's [UK Department for
Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs] response to its consultation on
tackling TB.

"While the delay in the announcement is frustrating for all those
vets and farmers dealing with the disease, we understand that it is
vital that the Government gets it right and bases any decision on
sound science."
