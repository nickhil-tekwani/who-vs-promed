Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 19 Mar 2014
Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 14 Apr 2014
Report date: 2 May 2014
Reason for notification: reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 19 Dec 2010
Manifestation of disease: sub-clinical disease
Causal agent: prion
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to the whole country

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Porto Esperidiao, Mato Grosso
Date of start of the outbreak: 19 Mar 2014
Outbreak status: resolved (1 May 2014)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed /Slaughtered
Cattle / 1177 / 1 / 0 / 50 / 0
Buffaloes / 11 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: 12-year-old female bovine tested during emergency slaughter at the slaughterhouse. The animal was born and raised on a full-cycle beef farm on extensive grazing, with a population of 1177 cattle and 11 buffaloes.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comment: as part of the Brazilian surveillance system for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), the prion marker was identified on 14 Apr 2014 in a 12-year-old female bovine sent for emergency slaughter because she was found fallen at her arrival at the slaughterhouse following some problems during transport. The animal was born and raised in the same full-cycle beef farm on extensive grazing. Meat and other products from this animal did not enter the food chain and there was no risk for human population. Tracing back animal movements since 2000, it was established that some animals from the birth cohort of this animal had been moved to 10 other properties in 3 municipalities in the state of Mato Grosso. During the epidemiological investigation, 49 animals from the cohort, which did not show clinical signs of the disease, were destroyed. Samples of nervous tissue were taken from the cohort animals and tested for BSE at the National Laboratory and all were negative on 1 May 2014. All control measures according to the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code have already been applied in order to close the outbreak and only the results of the typing tests carried out at the Reference Laboratory at Weybridge (United Kingdom) are pending.

Control measures
Measures applied: quarantine; screening; modified stamping out; no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results:
a. Laboratory name and type: National Agricultural Laboratory (LANAGRO/PE) (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
1. Cattle / immunohistochemical / 14 Apr 2014 / Positive
2. Cattle / immunohistochemical / 1 May 2014 / Positive
b. Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency (AHVLA), Weybridge, United Kingdom (OIE's reference laboratory)
Cattle / immunohistochemical / 1 May 2014 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[Following the publication of Brazil's 1st BSE case in December 2012, about 2 years after the initial detection of the case in a 13-year-old cow in Parana, there were published concerns addressing the declared safety for the consumers of Brazil's beef and the credibility of the country's BSE surveillance (see ProMED-mail post 20121209.1444250). The BSE case was later identified by the reference laboratory as 'atypical'. To address the questions raised, on 20 Dec 2012 OIE published a press release entitled "Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) case in Brazil: Frequently Asked Questions and Answers" (http://www.oie.int/en/for-the-media/press-releases/detail/article/bovine-spongiform-encephalopathy-bse-case-in-brazil-frequently-asked-questions-and-answers/). For subscribers' convenience, the entire document is copied herewith:

"Q. Is beef meat produced in Brazil safe for consumption?
A. Eating red meat (that is, deboned skeletal muscle meat) poses no risk to consumers, regardless of the BSE risk status of the cattle population of the producing country. Besides, in this case in Brazil, the dead animal was destroyed and did not enter the food or feed chain.

Q. Are import bans on Brazilian beef and beef products justified according to OIE's recommendations?
A. The international standard for BSE provides recommendations on the safe trade of meat and other products, even from countries with BSE. The OIE's international standards are democratically adopted by all OIE Member Countries; but the World Trade Organization rules allow its Members to apply trade restrictions on a provisional basis while awaiting further information.

Q. Does this case lead to a suspension of the current OIE disease status of Brazil?
A. BSE is a disease for which the OIE established official recognition of the sanitary status in countries and zones. The OIE has defined a transparent, science-based, and impartial procedure for the recognition of BSE risk status of Member Countries. Brazil is recognised as having a negligible BSE risk, that is, the most favourable category.

As the OIE procedure is based on an overall assessment of risk, the occurrence of a BSE case does not automatically lead to a suspension of the BSE risk status, except in the event of a change in the epidemiological situation indicating failure of the BSE risk mitigating measures in place. So far there is no reason for suspending Brazil's BSE risk status. Epidemiologic aspects of this event will be examined and discussed at the next meeting of the Scientific Commission for Animal Diseases in February 2013. [The report of the meeting is available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Internationa_Standard_Setting/docs/pdf/SCAD/A_SCAD_Feb2013.pdf].

Q. Why such a delay in the notification of BSE case?
A. BSE is a complex disease, not easily diagnosed. According to statements made by Brazilian animal health authorities, national regulations, and routine procedures applicable to suspected neurological diseases in a country with a negligible risk were followed but had some logistical problems in a national laboratory, leading to the delay in obtaining confirmatory diagnosis.

Q. What does atypical BSE mean?
A. There are naturally and sporadic occurring forms of encephalopathies in several mammalian species, including man. The pathogenesis of sporadic forms of BSE (which would be called "atypical" to distinguish them from the forms occurring through contaminated feed) is currently under scientific investigation. At present time, the OIE does not yet recognise an atypical form of BSE as a distinct entity for the purpose of its international standards; therefore, it is not mentioned in the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code, which does not distinguish between different forms of BSE."

At present, Brazil is included among the 25 countries listed as having a "negligible BSE risk" status (see http://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/official-disease-status/bse/list-of-bse-risk-status/).

Results of the typing at Weybridge [Central Veterinary Laboratories, England] are anticipated with interest. - Mod.AS
