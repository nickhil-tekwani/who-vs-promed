The director of animal health at the Ministry of Agriculture, Dr. Hussein al-Suleiman, said that some cattle already vaccinated against LSD [lumpy skin disease] virus have been identified with the disease. This virus [source of contagion] came from areas controlled by armed terrorist groups.

Dr Al-Suleiman told Al-Baath that the ministry is vaccinating the entire herd, focusing on the border zone with the areas controlled by the armed terrorist groups, as there is no preventive immunization of the animals [in the terrorist-controlled areas]. Therefore, the virus [is transmitted] by flying and blood-eating insects [from the infected area into] the safe areas. The virus affects cows only and does not spread to humans or sheep. It started in 2006 in Egypt and then spread to Syria. In 2013, it spread throughout the Middle East.

Dr Suleiman pointed out that the Ministry has followed compulsory and free immunization since 2013, and since the 4th month of each year before the emergence of insects. [Cases have been concentrated] near the areas of contact, and the situation [is] under control and infected cows in the process of healing.

Dr Suleiman said that, so far, 40 cases of lumpy skin disease (LSD) have been recorded in cows in the Al-Ghab area in Hama governorate; 5 cows have died as a result of the disease. He explained that the General Authority for the forestry management and development has taken a number of measures. Control measures against the disease started at the beginning of [May 2019] in "Jorin and the surrounding villages," where LSD was identified, and in villages located in direct contact with the villages of Idlib. The disease was limited, and 12 cases were registered following 25 days of preventive vaccination in the villages mentioned. Three training seminars were held for educators and [veterinarians and paraprofessionals]. There was coordination with the municipality to carry out insecticide spraying to eliminate the carrier of the disease and to deal with the dead animals, as well as instruction of the Internal Security Forces to prevent the transfer of cattle to and from the affected region.

Dr Suleiman said that as a result of the provision of treatments and follow-up training of veterinary technical staff, there was an 80% recovery of the infected cases, with 20% under treatment, in addition to the implementation of a 2nd vaccination/support dose for all the cows in the 1800-head herd; each cow was vaccinated with a special injection. Continuous follow-up will be carried out by the directorate of Animal Health in the Forestry division.

[Before 1989, lumpy skin disease (LSD) was reported only in Africa. In 1989, LSD moved beyond Africa when Israel confirmed its 1st LSD outbreak. In subsequent years, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Yemen, and the West Bank also reported LSD incursion. Lebanon and Jordan joined LSD-affected countries in 2012 and 2013, with Iraq and Iran in 2014. Turkey reported the disease in October 2013. The presence of LSD in the Syrian Arab Republic has not been officially reported to the OIE, likely because of the current armed conflict, but the disease probably traveled through Syria to Turkey (http://www.fao.org/3/a-aq706e.pdf).

For an excellent review article on lumpy skin disease literature, see:
Al-Salihi KA. Lumpy skin disease: Review of literature. MRVSA. 2014; 3(3): 6-23. http://mrvsa.com/upload/3-3-2-2014%20Lumpy%20Skin%20disease%20%20Review%20of%20literature.pdf

For a map of Syria showing governates, see https://www.freeworldmaps.net/asia/syria/. It is noteworthy that there has been LSD activity in Israel to the southwest of Syria (see http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=30698). The affected governorates in Syria are in close proximity to Turkey, where 2 outbreaks have been notified this year (2019), although the locations of these outbreaks have not been specified (see https://ec.europa.eu/food/sites/food/files/animals/docs/ad_adns_outbreaks-per-disease.pdf) or reported to OIE. - Mods.SF/MPP

LSD was initially suspected to be circulating in Syria in July 2012 when the disease emerged in cattle grazing in Israel, on the Syrian border (20120728.1218484). This evolved into a major epizootic (232 outbreaks), spreading throughout northern Israel and beyond. It reportedly resolved in September 2013, the disease remaining absent for almost 5 years.

In 2013 and 2016, Syria was again suspected as the source of LSD entering Lebanon (20131109.2047088 and 20160724.4365199).

A recent reintroduction of LSD into northern Israel, after its absence since 2013, has again been attributed to the virus circulating in Syria (20190605.650505).

The Syrian official quoted in the current (Syrian) media report said, "LSD started in 2006 in Egypt and spread to Syria." It would be interesting to note if this means LSD had been present in Syria during any period earlier than 2012. Since 2005 (the launching year of OIE's WAHIS portal), each of the Syrian annual reports referred to LSD as a disease "not present during the year." During the period 2005-2014, "general surveillance" was, reportedly, applied; since 2015, "general and targeted surveillance" is being applied.

The official position of the cited Dr Hussein Al Suleiman is "director, Animal Health Services, directorate of animal health, Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform, Damascus, Syria." Dr Al Suleiman is Syria's representative to the OIE.

More details of the event and measures applied (e.g., vaccination) are expected to be covered in the anticipated official report. - Mod.AS
