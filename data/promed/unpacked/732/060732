From: Eric Shoemaker <eshoemaker@webbernet.net>

I have enjoyed this past Winter of bird watching/feeding especially because
I had no House Finch suffering from _Mycoplasma gallisepticum_ at all. I
was beginning to think the disease had run its' course in my area of south
Michigan and we were rid of it.
That is until today ... I first saw a female House Finch with both eyes
badly crusted over and barely able to get around. My disappointment turned
to shock when a little later I observed a female Northern Cardinal feeding
in my platform feeder with both of her eyes badly swollen and crusted. I
was able to photograph her as she was feeding. As far as I know, there are
no other suspected cases of this disease in the Northern Cardinal.
I am unsure as to what I should do with this information and whom it should
be reported to. I would appreciate any input on this.

[In that it seems that this condition has re-surfaced slightly earlier than
last year. Would those monitoring this condition please contact Eric and
copy to ProMED-mail. Thanks. - Mod.MHJ
