The Lancet reported during 3 weeks in September, 1999, four children from
different families in urban slums in north India (3-8 years of age; three
girls, one boy) presented with diphtheria. All these children had fever,
sore throat, dysphagia, and swelling in the neck of 2-10 days' duration.
Two children had not been immunized, whereas the other two had received
only two doses of the diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus vaccine in their first
year of life. The children all had extensive membranes in the throat; one
child also had laryngeal involvement. Electrocardiography showed features
suggestive of myocarditis in three children, two of whom died within a few
hours of admission as a result of arrhythmias.
The occurrence of four cases in a short period suggests a resurgence of
diphtheria. Records between 1990 and 1998 did not reveal any cases of
microbiologically confirmed diphtheria. Although clinically diagnosed
diphtheria has been reported in India up to the early 1990s, the cases were
not microbiologically confirmed. The epidemic in the former USSR in the
early 1990s was attributed to a large population of susceptible children
and adults, a decline in childhood immunization, poor socioeconomic
conditions, and large-scale population movements. In India, there is 44%
drop-out rate between the third dose of primary immunization and the first
booster. Large-scale migration and overcrowding in the urban slums are also
problems in India.
