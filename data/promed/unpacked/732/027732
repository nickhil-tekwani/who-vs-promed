Indonesia: Chikungunya Outbreak Spreading in West and Central Java
-------------------------------------------------
Health officials have warned that further outbreaks of chikungunya were
possible anywhere in Indonesia, with the mosquito-borne disease already
having infected hundreds of people in several towns in West and Central
Java. Thomas Suroso, the director of the Arbovirus Diseases Eradication
Unit at the Ministry of Health, told The Jakarta Post on Thu 20 Feb 2003
that unlike the generation of 20 years ago, which was immunized against
chikungunya, the current generation was highly susceptible to the disease,
as it had not been immunized [by prior exposure to the virus - Mod.CP].
He said chikungunya disease, carried by the mosquito _Aedes albopictus_ ,
was relatively easy to eradicate using common pesticides. Like the _Aedes
aegypti_ mosquito, which carries dengue fever, _Aedes albopictus_ is
usually active during the day, Thomas said. He explained that _Aedes
albopictus_ tends to breed both in suburban and rural areas, whereas _Aedes
aegypti_ is mostly found in densely populated urban areas.
The disease has infected more than 500 people in certain parts of
Yogyakarta province and 250 others in the West Java capital of Bandung
since last December [2002], local officials said. It spread last week to
Cirebon, West Java, where more than 70 people have been affected since
mid-January [2003].
However, a local senior health official, Sri Budiartiningsih, said on
Thursday that her agency had recorded at least 94 cases of chikungunya
disease in Cirebon, adding that the disease was first detected in Bojor Lor
village in Klangenan subdistrict and spread to the adjacent villages of
Bojong Wetan and Kreyo. Last year, the disease also hit the West Javan town
of Bekasi and the Central Javan towns of Purworejo and Klaten.

local health officials have been unable to confirm the presence of the
virus, despite the fact that some people there were suffering from
continuous fevers and severe muscle and joint pains. - Mod.CP]
