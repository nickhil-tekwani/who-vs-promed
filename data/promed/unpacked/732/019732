Two Connecticut hospitals, including the Connecticut Children's Medical Center in Hartford, are treating suspected cases of enterovirus D68 [infection], the mysterious respiratory illness that has hospitalized children in a dozen states, according to a spokesperson for the hospital. Hospital officials at Connecticut Children's said lately they've seen an unusual increase in the number of children being rushed to the emergency room with respiratory symptoms and that 8-10 children may have contracted the virus.

"We can confirm that we are treating children with respiratory illnesses at Connecticut Children's who have exhibited symptoms of enterovirus D68 [infection]," said hospital spokesman Bob Fraleigh, in a statement Friday [12 Sep 2014] night. "At this point it is important to note they are possible cases, not confirmed cases. We will not know anything further until the CDC has had the opportunity to run their tests and then communicate those results back to us."

An outbreak of an uncommon virus, enterovirus D68, has made children in a dozen states ill and has left some hospitalized, according to NBC News. Children with asthma are particularly affected. Children exhibiting symptoms of the virus [infection] have been tested for enterovirus D68 virus and results will be available on Monday [15 Sep 2014], according to the hospital. "The Connecticut Department of Public Health (DPH) has received reports from 2 hospitals in different parts of the state of clusters of severe respiratory illness among young children that could be due to enterovirus D68," Gerrish said in a statement Friday [12 Sep 2014], adding that the DPH is facilitating tests to make specific diagnoses. There is no known vaccine for the illness, which was 1st identified in California in 1962, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]. A total of 97 confirmed cases have been reported around the country from mid-August to 12 Sep [2014], according to Gerrish. Affected states include Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky and Missouri.

"The DPH has asked clinicians to consider laboratory testing of respiratory specimens for enteroviruses when the cause of infection in severely ill patients is unclear, and to report clusters of severe respiratory illnesses to their local public health agency and DPH," Gerrish said. Enterovirus 68 presents like a bad cold or flu. Symptoms include high fever, runny nose, sneezing, coughing, wheezing and difficulty breathing, according to the CDC. No fatalities have been linked to enterovirus 68.

[Enteroviruses are associated with various clinical symptoms, from mild to severe. Enterovirus and rhinovirus species names recently were revised to remove host names and to append the type number to the species designation; hence, human enterovirus 68 (HEV-68, also previously called EV68) is now EV-D68. EV-D68 causes primarily respiratory illness, although the full spectrum of disease remains unclear. EV-D68 was originally isolated in 1962 and, since then, has been reported rarely in the United States. Small clusters of EV-D68 associated with respiratory illness were reported in the United States during 2009-2010. There are no available vaccines or specific treatments for EV-D68, and clinical care is supportive (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr).

It is unclear at present whether the current outbreaks of serious respiratory disease among children in several states of the Midwest and beyond are due entirely to enterovirus D68 alone without involvement of other respiratory pathogens. More precise information is awaited. - Mod.CP
