Meningococcal Meningitis at Fort Leonard Wood (edited)
-----------------------------------------------------------
A male Army recruit at Fort Leonard Wood [Missouri] has become the
fifth person to contract bacterial meningitis since the start of an
outbreak on the base 5 weeks ago. The 20-year-old soldier is "very
seriously ill" with meningococcal meningitis.Base officials said,
however, that he is improving and is expected to recover.
A 12-year-old boy who lived on the base died 30 Mar 2002 of the
disease. Public health officials are investigating whether any of the
cases are linked. Of the recruits affected, 2 were deployed to the same
Navy unit. All of the trainees, 3 men and a woman, had been
vaccinated at the start of training [the time span between vaccination
and onset of disease is not stated - Mod. LL] said hospital commander
Col. Jeri Graham. The other affected recruits have been treated and
released.
Servicemen and women are routinely vaccinated because of their close
living quarters, which puts them at higher risk for the disease. In
response to the outbreak, the Army has been vaccinating people
between ages 2 and 29 who work, live, attend school or regularly visit
the base. More than 5500 people have been vaccinated in the last 2
weeks.
"We are very concerned and we have taken extreme measures to
control the outbreak," said Dr. Eduardo Simoes, Missouri state
epidemiologist. The last trainee fell ill 5 days after getting vaccinated,
said Lt. Col. Michael Deaton, deputy commander of clinical services.
The immunization, which usually requires 10 to 14 days to develop
immunity, has about 90 percent efficacy.

[Meningococcal disease epidemics have been classically described in
closed communities such as military recruit camps. The currently used
vaccine is a nonconjugated polysaccharide quadrivalent product
containing the A, C, Y & W135 types. Type B vaccine is not yet
available (the unconjugated antigen is not antigenic by itself) but
prototypic vaccines have been evaluated. The drawbacks of the
current vaccine, in addition to not having utility for type B, are short-
term protection (perhaps 3 years) and the lack of development of
immunological memory. Conjugated vaccines are under development
and evaluation. The serotype involved in this cluster of cases is
unstated.
Postexposure prophylaxis for close contacts of cases also involves the
use of an appropriate antimicrobial such as rifampin, ciprofloxacin, or
ceftriaxone. - Mod.LL]

Burkina Faso
----------------
As of 28 April 11 899 cases including 1 368 deaths (case-fatality ratio
11.5%) have been reported to WHO. During the week of 22-28 Apr
2002, the number of cases reported, 652 cases and 67 deaths with a
case-fatality rate of 10.5 percent, indicate a downward trend in the
epidemic. For more information see the article in the Weekly
Epidemiological Record:
<http://www.who.int/wer/77_1_26.html>
The emergence of meningococcal serogroup W135 in Burkina Faso has
major implications for public health in the African continent. A
research agenda has been agreed by Le Comite National de Pilotage
pour la Meningite (Crisis Committee) established by the Ministry of
Health in Burkina Faso and supported in its implementation by a
research team consisting of WHO, Epicentre, WHO Collaborating
Centre for Reference and Research on Meningococci, Oslo, Norway,
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, Atlanta, USA ), and
l'Association pour la Medecine preventive (AMP). The topics include: a
detailed description and evaluation of the risk factors of the current
epidemic; an ecological analysis of association between vaccine
coverage and epidemics; _N. meningitidis_ seroprevalence and
carriage; and the socioeconomic impact of the epidemic. The team is
assessing the feasibility of estimating immunogenicity and efficacy of
tetravalent vaccine.
Niger
-------
As of 21 April 3 518 cases including 308 deaths (case-fatality ratio
8.8%) have been reported to WHO. The district of Matameye (Zinder)
is still particularly affected. La Direction Regionale de la Sante
Publique et de la Lutte contre les Endemies of Maradi is investigating
the situation in the districts of Dakaro and Guidan-Roumdji where
cases are still being reported by the local health teams.
