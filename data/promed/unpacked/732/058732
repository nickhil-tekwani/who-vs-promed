"March 1998 Update on the Classical Swine Fever Outbreak in The Dominican
Republic." Submitted by the Department of Animal Health & Livestock
Production, Secretariat of State for Agricultire, Dominican Republic
Following the recognition of classical swine fever (CSF) in Haiti in
October 1996, it was officially noted in the Dominican Republic in June
1996, and various control responses were initiated. However by September
1997, there had been 15 outbreaks from the Haitian border to the National
District and to the Eastern Region. A total of 7,097 pigs had been
destroyed and DR$4,202,910 (= US$ 299,799) paid in compensation. There are
[sic ten active outbreaks "still to be dealt with".
Due to the recent spread of outbreaks, mostly on "non-organised open"
farms, the national Executive Committee for Swine Fever Eradication in late
1997 authorised perifocal vaccination, restricted to the areas where the
disease was found, and the slaughtering of affected animals and those
in-contact. In January & February 1998 the disease was found to have spread
to Central Cibao with the number of foci found in different areas of the
country had increased to 42. This necessitated a change in national
strategy. A national vaccination programme was developed for all
susceptible herds, and the slaughter of infected pigs on affected farms and
the vaccination of the apparently healthy. To carry out this programme some
250,000 doses of the Chinese Strain (Pestiffa type) were acquired from
France. The producers have acquired an additional 300,000 doses.
To date some 400,000 pigs have been vaccinated on commercial and in
backyard herds, including 95% in the National District. It has been
expanded to the South, Southwest, East, and Central Cibao regions. The
national herd is estimated at 700,000 pigs.
By January 1998 8,894 pigs had been destroyed at a cost of DR$ 5,409,811.
This indemnity programmes has been suspended.
IICA and USDA-APHIS are currently preparing a proposal to control and
eradicate CSF in the Dominican Republic and Haiti.

[Would an informed person bring us up to date on this situation. I was as
confused by this report as you may have been. The reality is clearly
serious and the present level of adequate control is not obvious. - Mod.MHJ
