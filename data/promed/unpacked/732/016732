The Kharkiv Regional Laboratory Center has registered the 2nd case of botulism in 2022. According to the center, the individual is a resident of Kharkiv (Kharkov). He ate dried fish (blue bream, carp family). The man bought the fish the day before at a retail outlet. A day later, he developed weakness, a severe headache, nausea, vomiting, and impaired vision. In serious condition, the patient was hospitalized in the second city clinical hospital. He was injected with anti-botulinum serum.

Information was sent to the main directorate of the State Food and Consumer Service of the Kharkiv Region about the need to conduct an audit of compliance with sanitary legislation by the trade object where the fish was purchased. The 1st case of botulism in the region was registered in July 2022.

[Classically, botulism is a foodborne disease caused by the ingestion of a preformed toxin, although there also exists wound botulism (in which _Clostridium botulinum_ spores germinate in a wound) and infant botulism (in which the spores germinate in the intestinal tract).

Types A, B, and E of human botulism are the commonest. Although all types have a similar symptom complex, Hughes and colleagues report that type E is much more likely to produce initial lethargic mental status and more autonomic dysfunction (1). In Eastern Europe, many of the cases are type E related to the ingestion of salted or dried fish.
