[1] Israel ex Ukraine (Cherkasy)

Rabbi Chaim Koenig, the Menahel of mosdos Breslov in Tzefas [Safed, Northern district], is hospitalized in Carmel Hospital in critical condition, diagnosed with the measles. According to the Ynet report, the rabbi contracted the measles following his return home to Israel from a visit to Uman (Cherkasy region, Ukraine].

On Sun 28 Tishrei [7 Oct 2018], the rabbi was placed on an ECMO [extracorporeal membrane oxygenation] machine, which replaces heart/lung functions, and was transferred from Ziv Hospital to Carmel Hospital, where he remains in critical condition in an intensive care unit. Officials report he has a severe viral pneumonia, which has resulted from the measles.

Israel's Health Ministry recently released a warning that persons who traveled to Uman may have been infected with the measles, referring to passengers on both KLM and Air Ukraine airlines, urging them to get vaccinated. The illness appears to be making a return as there are many people who refuse to have their children vaccinated.

According to the ministry, the largest numbers of cases of measles this year [2018] are being reported in Petach Tikvah, with 53. Tzefas is next with 43 cases, followed by Tel Aviv with 22 and Jerusalem with 20.

Ukraine health officials reported [computer translated] an additional 554 measles cases (157 adults and 397 children) during the week ending 6 Oct 2018.

This brings the total number of cases to date to 32 489 (13 013 adults and 19 476 children). In addition, 14 people died of complications of the measles: 4 adults and 10 children.

Most people suffered from measles in Lviv (a total of 6460 people: 1994 adults and 4466 children), Transcarpathian (3149 people: 601 adults and 2448 children), Ivano-Frankivsk (3029 people: 858 adults and 2171 children), Odessa (2467 people: 1241 adults and 1226 children), Kyiv [Kiev] (2250 people: 1419 adults and 831 children), and Ternopil (1219 people: 668 adults and 1515 children).

The incidence of measles among children remains high. The risk of getting sick is also increasing due to the joint stay of children in schools and kindergartens. Therefore, it is very important for the children to be vaccinated on time in accordance with the calendar of preventive vaccinations.

Officials stress that unvaccinated children cannot attend schools and kindergartens. The Ministry of Health of Ukraine and the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine in a joint official letter reminded the heads of regional and Kyiv city state administrations of the norms of the law (Article 15 of the Law of Ukraine, "On Protection of the Population from Infectious Diseases").

[It is surprising that there are so many measles cases and 14 deaths in Ukraine when the law requires children to be vaccinated to attend school.

Dr Emmanuel Robesyn of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) analyzed data from 7365 measles cases from January 2013 through December 2017 in Europe. This ECDC's analysis showed that one in 1000 measles patients died, and of those, the greatest fatalities were seen in the youngest cases, such as:
- cases in one-year-olds were 6 times more likely to die compared with cases of patients who were 2 years old or older;
- cases in infants younger than one year were 7 times more likely to die; and
- the vast majority (81 percent) of measles cases in Europe were reported in unvaccinated patients.

This study also noted that 33 percent of the patients were hospitalized, and 11 percent had pneumonia.

ECDC Director, Dr Andrea Ammon said: "It is essential that teenagers and young adults check their vaccination status as we are seeing a recurring pattern in measles outbreaks where they are being affected. She continued: "Countries may need to consider catch up campaigns to close vaccination gaps in teenagers and young adults." (excerpted from https://www.precisionvaccinations.com/international-travelers-ukraine-should-seek-measles-vaccination-advice-doctor-nurse-or-pharmacist).

However, according to the ECDC, there was a drop in EU/EEA measles cases overall in Europe between March and July 2018. - Mod.LK

An international traveler with a confirmed case of the measles visited several areas in New York and New Jersey counties, and health officials are warning that others may have been exposed to the disease.

Anyone who visited the locations in Rockland and Westchester counties in New York or Bergen county in New Jersey [listed in the source URL above] may have been exposed to measles.
