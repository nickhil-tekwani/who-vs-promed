This is my rebuttal to Drs. Zelicoff and Zilinskas' comments about my
PROMED posting concerning his report of the 1971 Aralsk smallpox
outbreak. There is a difference in our perspective with respect to how
data should be interpreted. In my opinion, the "burden of proof" is on Dr.
Zelicoff and Dr. Zilinskas to prove that the Aralsk outbreak represents a
deviation from the natural history of smallpox. My main objection is to
their use of "correlation coefficients" from the analysis of a very small
smallpox outbreak to justify sweeping changes in public health policy in
the control of smallpox. Our current public health policy on the control
of smallpox is based on over 200 years of clinical studies on the
management smallpox and over 100 years of clinical studies on the efficacy
of vaccinia vaccine.
The following are excerpts from several references in the medical
literature on hemorrhagic variola and vaccinia vaccination that argue
against the Aralsk smallpox outbreak representing a significant deviation
from the natural history of smallpox and, therefore, the result of a
"weaponized" smallpox virus. I did not include any references from Dr.
Henderson/Dr. Fenner since they may be viewed as "biased."
A.) Dr. Welch's 1897 Chapter "Smallpox and Varioloid" in A System of
Practical Medicine, Vol. 1, Infectious Diseases has one of the best
clinical descriptions of the various forms of hemorrhagic, malignant or
black smallpox (e.g. purpura variola, variola haemorrhagica pustulosa,
variola purpurica and variola nigrae) observed in the United States.(1) In
this reference is found the following comment:
"It is known, however, that this type of the disease (malignant or
hemorrhagic smallpox) varies in frequency in different epidemics."
B.) Dr. John Ruhrah's 1915 Chapter on Vaccination in the Frank Billing's
Forchheimer's Therapeusis of Internal Diseases, Vol. II, Infectious
Diseases has one of the most comprehensive review of vaccinia vaccination
and it's efficacy.(2) In this reference is found the following comment:
"Some idea of the death rate from small-pox in prevaccination times can be
gathered from a study of the table shown the deaths in Geneva over a period
of 180 years. It will be noted that the greater mortality is during the
first year of life, and that nearly all the deaths occurred before the
first ten years."
C.) From Osler's 1944 The Principles and Practice of Medicine, Chapter on
"Smallpox: Variola," (3) can be found these two comments:
In Osler's subsection on "Hemorrhagic Smallpox:"
"Hemorrhagic smallpox is more common in some epidemics that in others. It
is less frequent in children than in adults, and young and vigorous persons
seem more liable to it. Men are affected more frequently than women. The
influence of vaccination is shown in the fact that of 27 cases, 14 were
unvaccinated, while not one of the 13, who had vaccination scars, had been
revaccinated."
In Osler's subsection of "Smallpox modified by Vaccination:"
"As a rule, when smallpox attacks a person who has been vaccinated within 5
years, the disease is mild, but it may prove severe, even fatal. These
mild forms, easily overlooked, are as infectious as the more severe types."
D. ) Finally, Christie's 1974 "Infectious Diseases, Epidemiology and
Clinical Practice" summarizes several outbreaks due to "aerial convection"
reported in the 1960' and 1970's. (4) These epidemics were felt to be
air-borne and several were hospital-based. The most notable were in
Germany, at Meschede and Monschau in 1970.
Despite the relatively low infectiousness of smallpox in communities, there
have been well-documented, explosive outbreaks. The reason for this
dichotomy is one of the great mysteries of smallpox
epidemiology. Hemorrhagic cases by themselves do not imply a radically
more virulent or resistant smallpox virus since they have been reported in
other outbreaks and well described in the pediatric literature. The degree
of immunity of the population clearly correlates with the variability of
severity in smallpox outbreaks. Furthermore, the immunity offered by
vaccinia has been shown in numerous studies over the past two centuries to
be time-limited.
In summary, based on the medical literature, the hemorrhagic cases in the
1971 Aralsk smallpox outbreak do not suggest the involvement of a more
virulent (weaponized, hardened, or aerosolized) smallpox virus.
Furthermore, the morbidity and mortality reported in the Aralsk outbreak is
not significantly different from previous naturally-occuring epidemics of
smallpox that have occurred in populations with waning
immunity. Consequently, I remain in agreement with Dr. Henderson that the
1971 Aralsk smallpox outbreak does not change or add to the variables that
we are addressing in our public health strategy to this unlikely but
potentially devastating bioterrorist threat.
