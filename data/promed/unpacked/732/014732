The death toll from a viral illness striking children across China
has risen by 2 to 32, and the total number of reported cases has
jumped to nearly 25 000, health officials said Friday [9 May 2008].
The latest deaths from hand-foot-mouth disease occurred in the
southern province of Guangdong and in neighboring Guangxi, the
official Xinhua News Agency reported.

It said an 8-month-old girl died of the disease early Monday [5 May
2008] in Guangdong. Xinhua said she tested positive for enterovirus
71, a virus that can cause a severe form of the disease, a common
childhood ailment that typically causes little more than a fever and
rash. It was the 4th death so far in Guangdong, which has also
reported more than 7100 hand-foot-mouth infections.

In Guangxi, an 18-month-old boy died after falling into a coma 3 days
after he picked up the disease.

Xinhua said as of late Thursday [8 May 2008] that the number of
reported cases of hand-foot-mouth has jumped to 24 932. A day
earlier, the number of infections was 19 962, cropping up in areas
ranging from Guangdong province in the south to Jilin province in the
northeast and Anhui province in the country's heartland. Health
experts have said they expect the number of cases to rise as a result
of an order issued this week by the Ministry of Health requiring
health care providers to report infections within 24 hours.

Last year [2007], 80 000 hand-foot-mouth cases were recorded in China
with 17 deaths, the health ministry has said. Spokesman Mao Qun'an
said the figures were probably incomplete because reporting wasn't
mandatory then.

Hand-foot-mouth disease spreads through contact with saliva, feces,
fluid secreted from blisters, or mucus from the nose and throat.
There is no vaccine or specific treatment, but most children affected
by the disease typically recover quickly without problems. It is
unrelated to the foot and mouth disease that affects livestock.

The virus that has been raging in China for some weeks keeps
spreading: so far 34 children were killed and over 27 500 were
infected in the country. Among the victims an 8-month-old girl in
Guangdong, a one-year-old boy from Guangxi, and 2 other girls in
Anhui province where most victims [lived]. According to the
authorities more people [children?] are leaving the hospitals of
Anhui than are entering, a sign that the epidemic is slowing. Most of
the victims seem to have been [infected] with enterovirus 71 (EV71),
which causes [lesions] on hands, feet, and mouth.

The fever, which has also killed 10 children in Viet Nam, where 3000
people were infected, has also arrived in more developed regions like
Beijing (1500 cases) and Shanghai. The epidemic started in March
[2008] in east China and was officially announced only 2 weeks ago.

Several media have accused local authorities of hiding the danger (as
also happened in the 1st months of bird flu). In the past days, the
health ministry assured that the 'hand-foot-mouth disease' poses no
risk for the Olympic Games, despite the higher risk of spreading in
higher temperatures. The disease, which hits mostly children between
2 and 4, shows itself in an early stage with lesions in the mouth,
hands, and feet. In most cases, the symptoms pass in a few days, but
in some cases the virus is lethal.

[The death toll in the current country-wide outbreak of
'hand-foot-mouth disease in China has risen to 34 with the number of
cases now exceeding 27 5000. The good news is that there have been no
more deaths in Anhui province, the worst affected region with 22
deaths, and the number of patients requiring hospital treatment is declining.
