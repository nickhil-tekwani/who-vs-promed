Birds / 30 / 30 / 30 / - / 0
Affected population: chicken, ducks, geese

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Birds / 69.35 / 69.35 / 100 / **
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: contact with wild species

Epidemiological comments: Restriction zones have been established and epidemiological investigations started. Culling and safe disposal of birds is in progress. No bird or bird products have been dispatched outside from affected territories. A wild duck carcass was found during AI passive surveillance on the lake near the village just before the outbreak started. HPAIv H5N8 was detected in a sample of wild duck carcass.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; screening; traceability; quarantine; official destruction of animal products; official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste; control of wildlife reservoirs; zoning; disinfection; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied: stamping out

["Wild birds, as natural host and reservoir for all types of avian influenza viruses, play a major role in the evolution, maintenance, and spread of these viruses. The main wild species involved have proved to be waterfowls, gulls, and shorebirds; however, the virus seems to pass easily between different bird species.

"The incidence of infection appears to be seasonal, with the highest isolation rate being in juvenile birds in the fall of the year.

"Several routes of exposure of wild bird viruses to poultry have been documented or suspected of being the origins of outbreaks. Direct exposure to wild birds is the most likely transmission factor.

"Therefore, limiting exposure of poultry to wild birds through confinement rearing and other biosecurity measures provides an opportunity to reduce the risk of introduction of avian influenza virus from wild birds, and consequently is key to decrease the risk of evolution into highly pathogenic forms, exposure and infection of humans, and recombination with human viruses components to form viruses that can not only infect humans but readily transmit among humans."

"The outbreak situation of H5N8, which was reported in European countries in poultry and/or wild birds, has declined, and only one outbreak of H5N8 is ongoing in Bulgaria. It is more likely that the source of infection in these outbreaks is contact with wild birds and followed by limited local spread."
