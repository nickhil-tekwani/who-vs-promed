The State government will euthanise 3 horses after they were found to be infected with the deadly disease glanders. The Animal husbandry department based on the sample reports on [Mon 27 Mar 2017] issued the orders.

A total of 240 serum samples of horses and animals from the family of equines were collected from across the state and sent to National Research Centre on Equines in Hisar. Out [of] them, 5 were found to be positive. By the time the government received the report, 2 horses were already dead.

All the diseased horses were found in Rajsamand and Udaipur districts. "Out of all the samples, 5 were found to be infected with glanders. A total of 2 died of natural death and now we will have to put down the remaining 3 to put a check on the spread of this epidemic," said animal husbandry minister Prabhulal Saini.

[India and Brazil are known to lead the list of countries where glanders is endemic. Media reports on cases of the traditionally fearsome disease, glanders, are often published by the Indian press (another recent report is available at http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/glanders-causes-panic-in-two-districts-of-gujarat/articleshow/57761166.cms). This is not fully reflected in India's official reports to the OIE. According to India's recent reports to the OIE, the annual numbers of recorded glanders outbreaks (in equidae) countrywide were as follows: 2010 - 1; 2011 - 3; 2012 - 1; 2013 - 1; 2014 - 0; 2015 - 5; (annual 2016 report for animals not yet available). No statistics on the incidence of glanders in humans in India could be obtained.

Glanders is a contagious and fatal disease of horses, donkeys, and mules, caused by infection with the bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_. The pathogen causes nodules and ulcerations in the upper respiratory tract and lungs. A skin form also occurs, known as 'farcy'. Control of glanders requires testing of suspect clinical cases, screening of apparently normal equids, and elimination of reactors. _B. mallei_ can be transmitted to humans, but such cases, which were known to be often fatal, have become rather uncommon (see ref 1). In view of its zoonotic potential, all infected or contaminated (or potentially infected or contaminated) material must be handled in a laboratory with appropriate biosafety and biosecurity controls following a biorisk analysis.

The above and additional information on the disease, its causative agent and its diagnosis is available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.05.11_GLANDERS.pdf.

No vaccine against this disease is available.

The following list of countries from which glanders has been reported since 2010 is derived from ref 2, where subscribers can find additional updated information on the disease: Brazil, India, Iran, Kuwait, Mongolia, Myanmar, Afghanistan, Bahrain, Eritrea, Pakistan, Lebanon, Russia and Iraq. In 2014, a single case was notified from Germany, source of infection unknown.
