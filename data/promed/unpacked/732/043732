[The large number of mortalities on the 3 Aegean Greek islands serves as a reminder of the severity of bluetongue in sheep, particularly in relation to susceptibility of the breed exposed. Some dairy sheep breeds, such as the Sardinian breed in Sardinia, the Greek Chios breed, and the East Friesian breed, are known to be highly susceptible.

The Greek epizootic involves 3 islands adjacent to the Turkish mainland. Spread by culicoids, the same BTV-4 virus is, most probably, currently circulating in Turkey as well, with potential losses in local susceptible sheep breeds such as the Sakiz sheep.

The only effective way to reduce the grave BTV losses to sheep breeders is by vaccination. Availability of relevant vaccine strains is crucial.

Additional current foci of BTV activity in the Eastern Mediterranean have been officially reported from the Palestinian Autonomous territory (West Bank) and (unofficially) from Israel, since late September 2012. Laboratory confirmation and serotyping are awaited. - Mod.AS
