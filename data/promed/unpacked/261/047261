An outbreak of cryptosporidiosis could soar into the thousands, with
almost 250 cases already confirmed. Fearing an outbreak of the nasty
gastro bug, which 10 years ago left more than 1000 people ill after
swimming, health officials yesterday [27 Feb 2009] warned the public
to be cautious.

At least 19 pools have been ordered to super-chlorinate their water
after infected people identified they became sick after swimming, The
Daily Telegraph reports. The germ spreads with such ferocity,
especially in summer and in pools, that 44 cases alone have been
identified in the past day.

NSW Health's director of communicable diseases Dr Jeremy McAnulty
said anyone who had diarrhoea in the past fortnight needed to stay
out of pools.

"While there is no common link among most cases, some have reported
swimming in common pools," he said. "Pools can be easily contaminated
by infectious swimmers, and so it is vital that people take care."

NSW Health said there was no evidence these pools were the cause of
any infection. Most of the affected pools are from western Sydney.
NSW Health is refusing to name them individually, fearing it will lay
blame and cause further panic. All pools associated with the bug have
been tested, but no evidence of contamination has been found.

Cryptosporidiosis is a diarrhoeal disease caused by a parasitic
infection of the intestine. It surges in summer, usually because
people are outdoors drinking contaminated water and playing with
animals. Children are most susceptible with half of the confirmed
cases under 5.

Dr McAnulty said the number of cases had doubled since January 2009,
sparking concern it could soon mirror the horror outbreak of 1998.
"We don't know if any pool is the source of the outbreak, but we know
from previous outbreaks that swimming is a link," he said.

"Cryptosporidiosis is a bug that lives in animals, and people can
carry it. Once it gets into swimming pools, then it can really
amplify." The last major outbreak was the summer of 1998. The same
year, panic gripped Sydney when bugs, giardia and cryptosporidiosis
were found in the Prospect water filtration plant. It became known as
Sydney's water crisis, and households were ordered to boil water.

Despite the fear that thousands of people would fall ill, not one
person was found to become sick.

There is no treatment for the infection. Symptoms include diarrhoea,
stomach cramps, fever, nausea and vomiting, which can last weeks and
sometimes even months. Some persons do not present any symptoms. If
symptoms are present, they often last about 2 weeks, and then you may
feel better.

[ProMED's last report of crytosporidiosis from New South Wales
(Cryptosporidiosis - Australia (SA) (02): comments 20070324.1029)
points out that person-to-person transmission is more common than
expected.

Cryptosporidiosis is endemic in New South Wales, and surveillance is
well developed (Viney KA and McAnulty JM. The evaluation of web-based
data collection for enhanced surveillance of cryptosporidiosis. NSW
Public Health Bull. 2008;19:15-9

Studies have implicated transmission from zoonotic reservoirs (Ng J
et al. Evidence supporting zoonotic transmission of Cryptosporidium
in rural New South Wales. Exp Parasitol. 2008;119:192-5
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18343369?ordinalpos=4&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum>),
and transmission in swimming pools is also well known (Paterson J and
Goldthorpe I. Managing a cluster of cryptosporidiosis associated with
a public swimming pool. NSW Public Health Bull. 2006;17:80
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17036085?ordinalpos=6&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum>).
