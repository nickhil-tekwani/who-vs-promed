Reports from the southern Somali village of Leego indicate that at least 19
children, mainly under 5 years of age, have been killed by a measles
outbreak in the past 48 hours.

An elder in the village, Musse Aden Hassan, on Tuesday [9 Nov 2010]
confirmed the deaths of the 19 children, adding that more than 30 others
have fallen ill with the disease. "The situation here is very precarious;
children are dying every hour, and there is no health centre here," said
the elder, who called on international aid agencies and local Somali
business people to come with urgent humanitarian assistance.

Meanwhile, severe drought resulting in serious lack of water has led
thousands of families to flee from Leego and 6 surrounding villages,
according to Musse Aden Hassan, who is one of the most revered elders in
the village. "Lack of water is another big problem here, and we buy a
barrel of water for 40 000 Somali shillings [about USD 25.00], and most
residents cannot afford this high price, and that is why thousands of
farmers and pastoralists have fled from here," the elder told APA.

Somalia has not had a functioning central government since the 1991
downfall of former military ruler General Mohamed Siyad Barre.

[This report indicates that, in deprived communities lacking medical and
basic supportive care, mortality from measles virus infection can be very
high in young children; perhaps around 40 per cent in this case.
