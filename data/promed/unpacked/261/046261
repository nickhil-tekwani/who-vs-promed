Serum samples from 2 calves, 2 goats, and one sheep from the Bourgas region
of Bulgaria were received by the Community Reference Laboratory for BTV at
IAH Pirbright on 27 Oct 2006 from the Central Veterinary Research Institute
(CVRI), Sofia, Bulgaria. All 5 serum samples were confirmed as positive for
BTV-specific antibodies by cELISA, (result within 24 hours). A serum
neutralisation test (SNT) against all 24 BTV was inconclusive, due to
bacterial contamination and low volumes of sera.
A 2nd set of samples was requested from the CVRI and arrived at the CRL on 6
Nov 2006. These included matched pairs of serum and EDTA blood samples from
4 sentinel calves from the village of Rezovo in the Bourgas district of
Bulgaria. Of the 4 serum samples, 3 were shown to contain antibodies against
BTV by cELISA (within 24 hours). However, no BTV RNA was detected in any of
the blood samples by conventional (seg-7) or real-time (Seg-1) RT-PCR.
Attempts to isolate virus in embryonated chicken eggs failed and the eggs
were still alive after 8 days. Attempts to isolate virus from these samples
in Bulgaria were also negative.
Antibodies against BTV serotype 8 were detected in 3 of the 4 serum samples
(confirmed in repeated assays). No significant neutralisation was detected
against the other BTV serotypes.
The CRL was informed that the 4 sentinel calves (2nd set of samples) were
previously tested by cELISA in June, July, August and September, in each
case with negative results, suggesting that the seroconversion happened in
late September / early October.
However, the observation that these sentinel calves were cELISA-positive for
BTV-specific antibodies, but RT-PCR-negative for BTV-specific RNA, or virus
isolation, is unexpected and difficult to explain. If the calves were
infected in the time period of about one month (since they were previously
sampled and found negative) they would also be expected to be PCR-positive.
It has been reported that cattle tested by RT-PCR can return to being
negative for BTV RNA after 80 to 180 days pi, but remain positive by cELISA
for longer periods (years). One possible explanation is that the calves
might have been infected >100 days earlier, or may have acquired maternal
antibodies, although neither hypothesis fits results from previous testing
of sentinel animals in Bulgaria.
In conclusion, the CRL has confirmed the presence of BTV-specific antibodies
as well as BTV-8 specific neutralising antibodies in animals in Bulgaria but
cannot yet confirm the presence of BTV serotype 8. The detection of BTV-8
antibodies may have particular epidemiological significance in view of the
northern European outbreak (2006) caused by BTV-8. Further samples from the
region are being requested.

[As stated, if the suspicion that the Bulgarian sentinels (bovines and goats
from the Turkish frontier) have been infected recently by BTV-8 is
convincingly established, this might have implications for the
epidemiological studies of the north west European BTV-8 epizootic.
Of interest, the vector of bluetongue in Bulgaria and the Balkans is
reportedly not _Culicoides imicola_ but, almost certainly, _C. obsoletus_
which is well represented in the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, France, and
other European countries.
Results of further studies in Bulgaria are anticipated with great interest.
