A town in the midwest Russian region of Tatarstan has been placed under quarantine after a local resident was diagnosed with anthrax.

The region's head, Rustam Minnikhanov, on Thursday [7 Aug 2014] declared a 2-month ban on transporting animals and animal products into or out of the town of Lyuga, which is seeing the region's 1st anthrax case in 11 years. Local residents are also prohibited from slaughtering livestock for consumption and from using milk produced by animals that could be infected. The quarantine could be shortened to 15 days provided that no further cases occur and that all safety measures have been fully observed, Minnikhanov said in a decree.

On Monday [4 Aug 2014], a resident of Lyuga, 48-year-old FG, was hospitalized in the regional capital, Kazan, and was diagnosed with cutaneous anthrax. Although often less fatal than respiratory anthrax, the cutaneous form of the disease can be contracted through spores when handling contaminated animal products.

Tatarstan's Health Ministry said that 19 people who had been in direct contact with FG were being screened for anthrax twice daily. Of the 190 people tested for anthrax in Lyuga, no one other that FG has been found to be afflicted with the illness.

[The previous outbreak in Tatarstan was in 2003 and involved Konstantinovka, Visokogorskiy rayon; the human case was a woman in Kazan. As Russia is hyper-attentive to human anthrax cases, and in the absence of any human cases in the interim, we cannot assume that livestock have not been afflicted in the interim.
