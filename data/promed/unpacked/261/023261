The following background information on dengue in Thailand was extracted
from the GIDEON software program:
In 1988, dengue accounted for 29% of all febrile episodes in Bangkok.
Disease rates peak during July to August. Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)
was first reported during an explosive outbreak in 1958 (2,250 to 3,000
cases with ca. 300 deaths). 88.5% of DHF cases during 1958 to 1970 were
reported from Bangkok and Thonburi.

[It would be useful to have attack rates, rather than numbers of cases but
if that's all we have, that's all we have. The official Thai pronouncement
that herd immunity may be decreasing sounds to me like a red herring and
that accepting increased virulence and infectivity might be an easier way
to avoid responsibility for the ever-expanding shadow of this disease. This
is true not only in Thailand, but elsewhere. - Mod.CHC
