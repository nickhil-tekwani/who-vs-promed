Six horses residing in McNair County, Tennesee, located in the southwest part of the state, have tested positive for equine infectious anemia (EIA).

State Veterinarian Charles Hatcher, DVM, told The Horse that the initial case was confirmed positive during the 1st week of March 2014.

"The ensuing epidemiological investigation yielded 5 more confirmed positive cases tied to the initial case, all in close proximity in McNairy County," he said. "Two premises are quarantined, and the epidemiological investigation is ongoing. No horses have been euthanized as of (25 Mar 2014). It is doubtful that the source of the disease will be discovered," he added.

Hatcher said that in the recent past, Tennessee has confirmed zero to 2 EIA cases each year. "It's important that equine owners follow all state rules and regulations governing EIA," he stressed. "In Tennessee, horses are required to be tested for EIA every 12 months if there is change of ownership or if horses are assembled at locations with multiple owners" [This is similar for most states within the United States. - Mod.TG].

The most common blood test to detect the disease is the Coggins test. He recommended area horse owners consult their veterinarians for additional information about EIA and best management practices for disease prevention. Equine infectious anemia is an incurable infectious disease of horses spread by biting flies, such as the horse fly and deer fly. The disease can cause fever, anemia, fluid accumulation on the chest or legs, and emaciation in some animals. The virus can also cross the placental barrier to cause fetal infection. Many horses do not show any clinical signs of disease or have very mild signs on 1st exposure and carry the virus subclinically.

All infected horses, including those that are asymptomatic, are potential carriers and are considered infectious for life. Infected animals must either be euthanized or remain permanently isolated from other equids to prevent transmission. There is currently no vaccine to protect horses against EIA.

[Equine infectious anemia (EIA) is an infectious and potentially fatal viral disease of members of the horse family. Another name for EIA is swamp fever.

The equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) is categorized as a lentivirus: it contains genetic RNA material, which it uses to produce DNA. This DNA is then incorporated into the genetic makeup of infected cells. Identified in France in 1843 and 1st tentatively diagnosed in the United States in 1888, EIA has commanded a great deal of attention over the years. No vaccine or treatment exists for the disease. It is often difficult to differentiate from other fever-producing diseases, including anthrax, influenza, and equine encephalitis.

By far, the majority of horses are inapparent carriers: they show no overt clinical abnormalities as a result of infection. They survive as reservoirs of the infection for extended periods. Inapparent carriers have dramatically lower concentrations of EIAV in their blood than horses with active clinical signs of the disease. Only one horsefly out of 6 million is likely to pick up and transmit EIAV from this horse. All horses infected with EIAV are thought to remain virus carriers for life. The inapparent form may become chronic or acute due to severe stress, hard work, or the presence of other diseases.

When horses are exposed to EIAV, they may develop severe, acute signs of disease and die within 2 to 3 weeks. This form of the disease is the most damaging and the most difficult to diagnose because the signs appear rapidly, and often only an elevated body temperature is noted. 1/5th of a teaspoon of blood from a horse with acute EIA contains enough virus to infect one million horses. The clinical signs of the acute form of EIA are nonspecific; in mild cases, the initial fever may be short lived (often less than 24 hours). As a result, horse owners and veterinarians may not observe this initial sign when a horse is infected with EIAV. These infected horses often recover and continue to move freely in the population. The 1st indication that a horse was exposed to, and infected with, EIAV may well be a positive result on a routine annual test.

If the horse survives this 1st acute bout, it may develop a recurring clinical disease with these signs:
- Fever: an infected horse's temperature may rise suddenly to about 105 F [40.6 C] or, rarely, as high as 108 F [42.2 C]. Then it may drop back to normal for an indeterminate period until the onset of another episode.
- Petechial hemorrhages: minute blood-colored spots appear on the mucous membranes.
- Depression: the horse appears more or less dejected (head hangs low) and generally listless.
- Weight loss: the horse may refuse feed or may eat an inordinate amount but still continues on an obvious decline from normal weight.
- Dependent edema: the horse may develop swelling, which is evidence of fluid collecting under the skin in the legs and under the chest and other underbody surfaces.
- Anemia: the horse's blood may experience a marked drop in its red corpuscle count and appear thin and watery. The animal may also have an irregular heartbeat, and a jugular pulse may become evident.

The horse with chronic EIA is the classic "swamper" who has lost condition, is lethargic and anorexic, has a low hematocrit, and demonstrates a persistent decrease in the number of blood platelets, especially coincident with fever induced by EIAV.

EIA is considered a classic blood borne infection. People have played an important role in EIAV transmission over the years by using blood-contaminated materials on different horses. The EIAV most frequently is transmitted between horses in close proximity by large biting insects, such as horseflies and deerflies. The bites from these flies stimulate defensive movement by the horse, which often results in an interruption of the blood feeding. When interrupted, the fly is motivated to complete the feeding as soon as possible. It then attacks the same or a 2nd host and feeds to repletion. In this manner, any infective material from the blood of the 1st host that is present on the mouthparts of the insect can be mechanically transmitted to the 2nd host. Insect transmission of EIAV is dependent on the number and habits of the insects, the density of the horse population, the number of times the insect bites the same and other horses, the amount of blood transferred between horses, and the level of virus in the blood of the infected horse from which the initial blood meal was obtained. The rate of transmission cannot be predicted accurately because of these variables.

Controlling the spread of EIAV involves minimizing or eliminating contact of horses with the secretions, excretions, and blood of EIAV-infected horses. This has been carried out in most areas of the world by testing and segregating test-positive horses from those with negative test results. Once the reservoirs of EIAV are identified, separated, and maintained a safe distance from the other horses, the transmission of EIAV is broken. Until all horses are tested, one must assume that each horse is a potential reservoir of EIAV and take precautions to see that his or her horses commingle only with horses with impeccable backgrounds (that is, they came from farms with only test-negative horses and have never been exposed to test-positive horses).

Horse owners can take a number of precautions to reduce the risk of infection:
- Use disposable syringes and needles. Follow the rule of one horse-one needle.
- Clean and sterilize all instruments thoroughly after each use.
- Keep stables and immediate facilities clean and sanitary. Remove manure and debris promptly and ensure that the area is well drained.
- Implement insect controls. The local veterinarian or animal health official can provide information about approved insecticides and other insect- control measures. Avoid habitats favorable to insect survival.
- Do not intermingle infected and healthy animals. Do not breed EIAV-positive horses.
- Isolate all new horses, mules, and asses brought to the premises until they have been tested for EIA.
