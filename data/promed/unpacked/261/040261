Two new variants [see comment] and 27 outbreaks of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) were detected in Dordogne during the 2020-2021 surveillance campaign, making this department the territory most affected by this disease in France.

The Dordogne represents nearly a third of the 93 bTB outbreaks in France. Of the herds infected this year [2021] in the department, 15 were completely slaughtered and 12 partially.

bTB is an animal disease transmissible to humans (zoonosis), caused by bacteria [_Mycobacterium bovis_].

This bacterium can infect many species of ruminants, domestic and wild (mainly cattle and deer), but also wild boars, badgers and foxes. To avoid any risk for humans, the veterinary services carry out a systematic inspection of animals after slaughter.

When an outbreak is discovered in a farm, all the animals concerned are slaughtered and then cleaning and disinfection operations are carried out before restocking the herds.

In difference with the specific human tuberculosis [caused by _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_], presenting inter-human transmission which is mainly pulmonary, bTB - when transmitted from animals to humans - presents "in 80% of cases, extra-pulmonary localization; in particular, renal", explains the Ministry of Agriculture on its website.

[It will be interesting to obtain information on the 2 "variants" mentioned, in particular data indicative of the origin (eg. badgers, wild boar), transmission and spread of the pathogen(s).

Information on the techniques applied for differentiation of strains inside each species belonging to the _M. tuberculosis complex_, including _M. bovis_, and distinguishing _M. bovis from _M. tuberculosis_, is available in chapter 3.4.6. of OIE's Terrestrial Manual (https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.04.06_BOVINE_TB.pdf; see page 1063).

_M. bovis_ has been identified in humans in most countries where isolates of mycobacteria from human patients have been fully characterised. The incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis caused by _M. bovis_ is higher in farm and slaughterhouse workers than in urban inhabitants. The transmission of _M. bovis_ to humans via milk and its products is eliminated by the pasteurisation of milk. One of the results of bTB eradication programmes has been a reduction in disease and death caused by bTB in the human population.

Although cattle are considered to be the true hosts of _M. bovis_, the disease has been reported in many domesticated and nondomesticated animals. - Mod.AS
