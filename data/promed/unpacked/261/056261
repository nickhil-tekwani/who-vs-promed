The St. Mary's Lacor Hospital in Gulu, Northern Uganda
------------------------------------------------------
Lacor Hospital is a fully-developed referral hospital with 463 beds, a full
range of diagnostic and curative services, well-established primary health
care activities, and several training and research programmes. St. Mary's
Lacor Hospital is the only sizeable private institution in Northern Uganda,
providing salaries of almost US$ 500 000 yearly for approximately 450
permanent employees. The hospital runs a highly-regarded nurse training
program with internship of newly-graduated medical doctors. [There are
courses for Enrolled Nurses, Registered Nurses, Laboratory Assistants,
Nurse Anaesthetists, and Health Education Assistants. Over 150 resident
students attend these permanent training programmes. During 1998 (figures
for 1999 are not available yet) there were 169 students in training, 130
enrolled nurses, 14 registered nurses, 8 laboratory assistants and 17 nurse
anaesthetists.
Medical Officers from Lacor Hospital regularly teach at the School for
Clinical Officers (Medical Assistants) of Gulu and up to 100 additional
students on external rotation come to Lacor Hospital for clinical practice.
Lacor Hospital is particularly active in the area of infectious diseases
such as TB and HIV/AIDS.

[Pierre Bigras comments that from one of the pictures published on the web
site, the total number of nurses can be estimated to be around 100-120.
This would imply that between 10-12% of the nursing staff became infected
while attending patients with Ebola fever. - Mod.CP

Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever: a Comment on the Case Fatality Rate
------------------------------------------------------------
I would hypothesize that the [possibly higher case fatality rate (CFR) for
nurses has something to do with dose and closeness of contact with cases.
Is there any evidence that people exposed to lower doses are able to fight
off the infection more easily? It would be interesting to stratify CFRs by
probable exposure dose.
