South Korea said on Tuesday a new outbreak of a livestock disease,
suspected to be foot and mouth, had been detected in 25 farms in the
country's northwest.
The Ministry of Agriculture said the outbreak of the Food and Mouth Disease
(FMD) disease, first reported on Sunday, was wider than initially thought,
forcing the killing of more than 57 cattle and pigs on Tuesday in the town
of Hongsung, about 110 km (68 miles) south of Seoul.
Japan said on Tuesday an outbreak of FMD had been confirmed among cattle in
southern Miyazaki prefecture following tests by an institute in Britain.
Officials said earlier more cattle at another farm in the same region were
suspected to have the disease, heightening fears of an epidemic could
devastate East Asia's livestock industry.
Since South Korea's first outbreak of confirmed FMD reported at a farm just
northwest of Seoul on March 27, suspected FMD cases have forced authorities
to destroy a total of 255 animals. But so far, South Korea has confirmed
only 15 cattle found on the first farm had the disease. The disease, which
affects cloven-hoofed animals, is fatal and highly contagious, although
cannot be transmitted to humans.
The outbreaks have prompted Japan, Taiwan, Australia and Hong Kong to
suspend some imports from Korea. Korea's pork exporters had set a target of
$400 million in sales this year, almost all of it for Japan.
"If the outbreak spreads nationwide, the impact on Korea's livestock and
related industries will be harsher than the financial crisis of late 1997,"
an industry source said.
An outbreak of FMD in Taiwan in 1997 forced authorities to slaughter a
quarter of the island's 14 million pigs and destroyed what had been a $1.55
billion-a-year pork export industry. Korean authorities have released no
official estimate for the potential impact of the disease but the total
value of South Korea's cattle and pig industry last year was 3.1 trillion
won ($2.78 billion), or 0.675 percent of gross domestic product.
