Fishermen on the beach at Gaza City were stunned when dozens of mobula rays mysteriously washed up onshore. The creatures belong to the Mobulidae subfamily and can grow up to 17 ft (5.2 m) wide. The dead fish were quickly carted to local markets; it was the 1st time in 6 years that these animals have been seen in these waters, according to a local video report.

Mobula rays are collectively referred to as flying mobula or simply flying rays, due to a tendency to jump out of the water, sometimes as high as 2 m [6.6 ft], while swimming. These rays can be confused with the more popular members of the same subfamily -- the manta rays. In any case, a pound of mobula flesh (450 g) (the animals can weigh 12 st (76 kg/168 lb or more) can sell for 5 shekels (approximately GBP 1, USD 1.5).

"Mobulas often travel in huge schools of thousands of animals and also leap from the water and twist in the air. This [incident] is strange to me and unknown to me as well. I have worked in the Gulf of California for many years where there are abundant mobula schools and I have never seen a mass stranding," Bob Rubin, from the Santa Rosa Junior College in California told Mail Online.

"These animals seem to have blood on the "wings" -- pectoral fins -- which may have come from slapping something -- boats, rocks, sand, each other?" Rubin, an expert on the ray family, added.

He also said that unless the stomach contents and condition of the gills were examined, it would be difficult to determine a cause of death. However, he hazarded that large underwater noises or electrical signals may have caused some state of disorientation.

[_Mobula_ is a genus of ray in the family Myliobatidae (eagle rays). Their appearance is similar to that of manta rays, which are in the same family. Species of this genus are often collectively referred to as "flying mobula" or simply "flying rays", due to their propensity for breaching, sometimes in a spectacular manner.

If the species implicated is the devil fish (_Mobula mobular_), this episode is of great concern as it is an endangered species. The total population was estimated at 400 individuals.
