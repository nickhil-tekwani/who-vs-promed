Since January this year [2013], 53 have died due to encephalitis and 362 others have suffered from acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) in Assam.

Another 24 positive cases of Japanese encephalitis were detected during the period, NRHM [National Rural Health Mission] state surveillance officer Dr B C Bhagabati told PTI.

Dibrugarh district in upper Assam accounted for the maximum deaths (13), he said; 10 of the deaths were reported this week, he said, with 3 deaths reported in Dibrugarh, 2 each in Sonitpur and Darrang, and one each in Jorhat, Lakhimpur and Morigaon districts.

Kamrup (Metro), where Guwahati is situated, had 29 incidences of the disease during the last 6 months.

As preventive measures, he said, the government has stepped up fogging and DDT spraying and intensified the ITBN (Insecticide Treated Bednet) scheme, besides holding awareness programmes in villages.

[The number of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection cases in this report is not clear. Are the 24 JEV positive cases in addition to or a part of the 53 total cases? The report indicates that the 53 cases are acute encephalitis, a term that often includes JEV infection in some or in all instances. Emphasis on mosquito control implies that JEV is responsible for these cases. In reports from previous years, acute encephalitis syndrome [AES] in north eastern India has been attributed in part or entirely to JEV infections. However, in some instances, JEV infections are reported to be responsible for a minority of the cases. There is no indication in these or previous reports this year [2013] whether individuals, especially the children, have been vaccinated recently against JEV infection. Without knowing the specific etiology of the encephalitis cases above, targeted control and prevention measures will not be possible.
