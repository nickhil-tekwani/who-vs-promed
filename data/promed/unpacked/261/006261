Dengue fever claims life of local man
-------------------------------------
HOUSTON: A Harris County man died Monday night of dengue hemorrhagic fever,
becoming the first fatality this year in Texas from the mosquito-borne
virus, a city health official said. "He had multiple-organ failure," said
Kathy Barton, a spokeswoman for the Houston Department of Health and Human
Services. Because of the patient's travel history and the disease's 7-14
day incubation period; "There's no doubt he did not get [contract the
disease it in this country," said Kevin Johnson, an epidemiologist with
the Harris County Health Department. Dengue is not spread by human contact
or by airborne particles. The man was returning from Bangladesh, via
London, when he began showing symptoms aboard a Continental Airlines flight
that landed in Houston on 24 Jul. Authorities at Bush Intercontinental
Airport notified Houston health officials of a passenger who was suspected
of having meningococcal meningitis. Meningococcal disease, which causes
swelling of the membranes of the spinal cord and brain [when it causes
meningitis as opposed to bacteremia without meningitis -Man. Ed. DS, is
contagious and has a high fatality rate. After flight No. 35 landed, the
patient and crew remained on the plane for less than an hour while a
Continental doctor examined the man. The other passengers were allowed to
leave when the plane arrived. The doctor determined the patient, who had a
fever, did not have meningitis and cleared him to leave the plane and see
his own physician. The city [DHHS determined at the time that the episode
posed no health risk to the crew or passengers. The patient went into a
hospital the night he arrived and later was transferred to Memorial Hermann
Hospital. "He was extremely critical by that time," Barton said. The man
died at 5:35 p.m. Monday.
Barton said lab results came back late Wednesday confirming dengue
infection. Sometimes called "break-bone fever," dengue comes on suddenly,
accompanied by high fevers, pounding headaches and joint and muscle pain. A
first exposure to the virus seldom results in death. But a second exposure
[an exposure to a different serotype of dengue virus - Man. Ed. DS puts
people at risk for the more severe form of the disease, dengue hemorrhagic
fever. There is no vaccine to prevent the illness, and doctors can only
treat symptoms with bed rest, fluids and medications to reduce fever.
Barton said the patient first fell ill 8 days before he arrived in Houston.
She said Bangladesh, in South Asia, is experiencing an epidemic of dengue.
There have been 2 nonfatal cases of dengue this year, according to the
Texas Department of Health [One wonders about the ability of state health
departments to monitor imported cases of this disease due to the difficulty
of establishing the diagnosis by physicians who have been trained in the
United States and are relatively unfamiliar with the disease. - Man. Ed.
DS. The first patient was a Louisiana man treated in Houston who had
traveled to South America. A second patient lives in Austin and had
traveled to Puerto Rico. A South Texas girl died from dengue hemorrhagic
fever in December, the first dengue death in the state in decades. The
state health department believes she contracted the illness during a visit
to Mexico.
In August of last year, there were 51 dengue cases confirmed by the state
health department, 16 contracted in South Texas. Other cases are believed
to have been contracted in Mexico or Brazil. Every year, travelers to other
countries are infected with the dengue virus and can potentially return to
Texas as a source for mosquitoes [of the genus _Aedes_ - Man. Ed. DS to
acquire the virus, according to TDH. Because the Houston man entered a
hospital soon after his arrival in Texas, health officials do not believe
he was exposed to mosquitoes which could, in turn, pass the virus to other
humans.
"There's (no disease) in the world that's more than 24 hours away," said
Vinetz, who specializes in mosquito-borne illnesses. Mosquito control is
the best prevention, public health officials said. The city, county and
state monitor mosquito populations on an ongoing basis to look for those
carrying the Dengue virus. Some dengue-positive mosquitoes were trapped
earlier this year in the Rio Grande Valley, said Kevin Johnson, an
epidemiologist at Harris County Health Department. "We were worried about a
blip this summer, but we have seen no additional mosquitoes," he said.

[One wonders if the patient had traveled previously to any areas that are
known to be endemic for dengue. If so, this could have been his second
infection with dengue, and this time to a different one of the 4 dengue
virus serotypes from his primary infection. The 4 antigenically related
dengue virus serotypes (DEN1-4), are each capable of causing clinical
dengue fever. There is evidence that dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock
syndrome may occur when a dengue virus of a different serotype from the one
which caused the primary infection infects an individual who has antibodies
to the serotype of the primary infection. Infection with a particular
dengue virus serotype does not confer immunity to the other serotypes but
may, instead, result in severe disease manifesting as DHF/DSS.
For those readers interested in further discussion on theories of the
pathogenesis of DHF/DSS and on the history of DHF/DSS, the three postings
cited above from 1999 are worth reading. - Man. Ed. DS
