A draft Commission Decision to revise the control measures for bluetongue
received a favourable opinion by member state veterinary experts meeting in
the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, which met today
[28 Aug 2006]. Over the past 2 weeks, bluetongue has been found in the
southern Netherlands, south east Belgium, and in parts of Germany on the
border with these 2 countries. The disease control measures laid down in a
Commission Decision last week were reviewed in light of the fact that
bluetongue virus has been isolated from the recent outbreaks and it has
been identified as serotype 8.
Under today's draft Decision, which will be adopted by the Commission in
the coming days, the restriction zone established last week will be
extended and formally added to the Annex of Decision 2005/393/EC on the
control and eradication of Bluetongue. This 150 km restriction zone will
cover all of Belgium, most of the Netherlands, areas in the German federal
states of North Rhine Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate, Saarland and
Hessen, all of Luxembourg, and parts of France bordering the Benelux
countries. In the restriction zone, stringent rules will apply to movement
of ruminants and all animals on holdings within this zone have to be
identified and checked for bluetongue by national authorities.
Within the 20 km protection zones established immediately around the
outbreak areas, the movement ban for all susceptible animals will remain in
place. Derogations from this movement ban are only provided for animals
being transported in or out of the zone for direct slaughter, for
restocking within the 20 km zone or to another holding within the 150 km
restriction zone. Any movement of ruminants out of the 150 km restriction
zone will be subject to strict conditions and veterinary approval. If
animals are to be moved from the restriction zone in one member state to an
area outside the restriction zone in another member state, the prior
agreement of the member state of destination is required.
The bluetongue situation will continue to be monitored closely by the
Commission and national authorities, and the measures will be adapted in
light of the evolution of the situation.

[Cooler temperatures in north west Europe, with subsequent decreased
activity of the _Culicoides_ vectors, is expected within the coming month
or 2. It will put the expediency of mass vaccinations during 2006 -- even
if a BTV-8 vaccine were immediately available -- in question. The
considerations and decision of the EU experts in this matter are
anticipated. Use of vector repellents to protect susceptible animals and
keeping them housed from husk to dawn -- while the vectors are active --
might provide some protection during the remainder of this year.
A table on the global geographical distribution of the 24 BTV serotypes, as
compiled by the BT reference laboratory at Pirbright, updated in March
2003, is available at
