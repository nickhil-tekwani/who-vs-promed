[1] Subscriber observations re: marketing systems
Date: Tue 14 May 2013

ProMED-mail post 20130514.1712913 contained excellent commentary on markets.

I have also been speculatively musing about similar issues to those raised by Nick Honhold in [2], including potential for there to be a non-poultry host-vector associated with live markets (or mixed markets) or market-place environments and/or low income households, at least in the eastern and southern area of China, that has yet to be elucidated.

Also, it is great to see in part [3] a more systematic study of marketing chains, practices and interactions by the US National Academy of Sciences (relating to a restricted area of Viet Nam). I am one of the many who believe that this is a real key in control of major outbreaks, especially in developing countries, and again, especially once a major disease becomes endemically established in them or their immediate land-border neighbors.

I believe that it might be appropriate to try to establish a standardized methodology for evaluating marketing/trading systems for live animals, fresh animal products and fresh plants and plant products that could be applied more universally as an appropriate and relevant national and sub-national vulnerability assessment tool. The marketing systems and trading chains are likely to be highly variable from culture to culture and country to country, but I suspect that it may be possible to establish a reasonably universal set of assessment criteria and a methodology to then enable countries to map their market and trading system-related vulnerabilities and the most appropriate and cost-effective key nodes for interventions more precisely.

At the end of the day, the functionality of marketing systems in terms of addressing food distribution and food security is absolutely essential and must be sustained within countries (especially developing countries with less functional transport infrastructure) and globally. Any disruption to them is invariably costly in more than just basic economic terms. It just is not practical to convert all live or wet market trading systems to frozen product systems, and, in fact, I do not see that as a sensible or reasonable thing to have to contemplate doing to market diversity and flexibility from either social or economic perspectives. We simply will have to find and apply much better systems for management of the different types of marketing and trading systems for fresh food (or more to the point, whole chains from a diverse production base to mouths).

China Development Bank (CDB), the country's policy lender, said on Tue [14 May 2013] that it has issued emergency loans worth 116 million yuan [USD 18.7 million] to help poultry firms cope with the impact of H7N9 influenza.

The loans, designated to be used by the companies to handle the new strain of bird flu, were granted to 2 poultry firms owned by Beijing Huadu Group Co., a leading chicken supplier, CDB said.

The move followed a Monday [13 May 2013] government announcement stating that 600 million yuan [USD 96.7 million] in subsidies will be issued in order to support poultry processing companies.

The loans are the 1st to be granted to Beijing-based poultry breeders since the outbreak of H7N9 in late March 2013.

Figures from the China Animal Agriculture Association indicate that [avian] influenza has caused losses of more than 40 billion yuan [USD 6.508 billion] for the poultry industry.

The government has ordered the culling of poultry and closure of live poultry markets in some cities, reducing demand all the way down the industry chain.

[3] H7N9 surveillance & avian biosecurity measures
Date: Wed 15 May 2013

Researcher Wang Xiurong of the National Avian Influenza Reference Laboratory reported on the status of nationwide monitoring for subtype H7N9 influenza virus [from sources which are not humans]. Up to now, the laboratory has identified 52 samples as positive for H7N9 influenza virus. They are mainly from the provinces of Shanghai, Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, Henan, Shandong, Guangdong and Fujian [and some related municipalities]. The virus has not been found in other provinces. She said that in March [2013], prior to the appearance of human infection with H7N9 influenza virus in China, routine influenza virus testing in poultry did not discover this type of virus. Moreover, the laboratory has determined that this influenza virus is of mild pathogenicity with limited horizontal transmission capability in domestic poultry.

Wang Xiurong advised farms to strictly control the movement of persons, perform strict daily disinfection, keep the farms as far as possible closed to visitors, and strictly apply the "all in all out" pattern [a system by which the entire population of the farm is traded/sold, enabling thorough cleansing/disinfection before repopulation. - Mod.AS]. Cases of illness or increased rates of unexplained deaths should be promptly reported. Veterinarians and those involved in livestock and poultry farming, capture, slaughter, storage, transportation and sale should strengthen self-protection and adopt necessary hygiene practices.

Wang Xiurong recommended that consumers buy poultry products from proper, formal markets and supermarkets. When preparing and storing, they should pay attention to the separation of cooked and raw poultry meat, wash hands immediately after contact with poultry or poultry products, and refrain from consumption of dead poultry. More scientifically safe habits of consumption should be gradually cultivated, and consumers should do their best to purchase processed or chilled products.

[Chinese consumers traditionally prefer freshly slaughtered poultry. In this respect, their preference is rather similar to that of consumers in some other parts of the globe, such as the Middle East (e.g. Egypt). In the case of chickens, the popular breeds in China are local ones, commonly known as "yellow chicken." Frozen poultry meat is (to say the least) not popular. In a considerable proportion of cases, particularly when elderly consumers are involved, they prefer to buy live birds which are then kept alive at home (e.g. in backyards) to be slaughtered close to their cooking/processing. In other cases, the poultry meat is purchased as soon as possible after its slaughter on the market. The same procedure, including the keeping of live birds, is commonly practiced by traditional catering enterprises/restaurants. The preferable alternative is the marketing -- as early as possible after slaughter in a certified facility -- of chilled poultry meat, either whole or in cuts. Special attention should be paid to the hygienic treatment of internal organs and to bird-legs, a popular product. More details, and corrections, from local sources on the above will be welcomed.

It seems that since H7N9 remains a virus of low pathogenicity for birds, the main hazard may be posed to those dealing with the live animals. This has been adequately described and addressed in item 3 above.

Changing deep-rooted, generations-old gastronomic and behavioural traditions and habits is an extremely complex if not impossible mission; in a crisis situation, when consumers become aware of the alternative health hazards, such changes may be somewhat boosted if adequately and immediately addressed. - Mod.AS
