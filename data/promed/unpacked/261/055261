The Centre has expressed concern at re-emergence of leprosy cases in certain pockets of the 8 northeastern states. Except for 4 districts of Assam, which recorded higher prevalence of leprosy than the national average, the [states in the] NE region are otherwise considered low endemic states. "It is a concern that the disease is re-emerging in certain pockets in the northeast," Dr CM Agrawal, Deputy Director General (Lep), Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, said.

The northeastern states reported 747 new cases [in the 1st 9 months of 2013] with Assam recording the most, 616 cases, Agrawal told PTI at the sidelines of a regional review meeting of state leprosy officers of the region.

Assam [with 616 cases] is followed by Nagaland (32 cases), Tripura (23), Sikkim (20), Mizoram (18), Arunachal Pradesh (17), Meghalaya (15), and Manipur (6).

In Assam, the most affected districts were Sivsagar and Tinsukia, which recorded 99 and 87 new cases respectively, followed by 42 in Sonitpur, 39 in Kamrup Metro, and 38 in Cachar district, Dr BL Deori, Joint Director of Health Services in Assam, said. All the other districts, except Chirang and Dima Hasao, registered new cases but their numbers were fewer.

Deori said the annual new case detection rate is 3.57 per one lakh [100 000] population with 63 cases in children this year [2013] alone, and over 1000 cases under treatment.

A total of 9 paramedical workers were also appointed in the most affected districts, she said.

In Nagaland, Dr KV Kimiki, State Leprosy Officer, said 30 cases were reported from Dimapur, while one each was reported from Kohima and Mokukchung districts.

Tripura reported 23 new cases and 69 patients are undergoing treatment, the official said.

Agrawal mentioned innovative approaches such as involvement of faith-based organisations or child-to-child approach in spreading awareness about leprosy.

It comprises 7 contiguous states -- Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Tripura -- and the Himalayan state of Sikkim (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_India). Almost 70 per cent of this population (26.64 million) lives in the state of Assam. The region is predominantly tribal and rural.
