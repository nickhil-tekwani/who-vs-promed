Controlling avian influenza [AI], both locally and globally, is becoming increasingly difficult, with the virus keeping one step ahead of scientific understanding.

"Despite massive investment, there are still some key gaps in our knowledge," according to Prof Ian Brown, head of virology at the [UK] Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA).

"We have endemic infection in 6 regions of the world -- China, Viet Nam, Indonesia, parts of India, Bangladesh, and Egypt -- where we can no longer track and monitor effectively the spread of this infection. We cannot bring it under control," he told the Global Alliance for Research on Avian Diseases conference at King's College, London, this week.

Even in places like Europe and Japan, where huge efforts had been made to contain AI, it still had a habit of coming back.

A major difficulty in containing the disease was that it was often hard to detect.

Governments that place countrywide bans on trade from countries where HPAI has been reported, could be doing themselves a disservice, UK chief vet Nigel Gibbens told the conference.

"We must not kill off trading routes. This is an over-reaction to the disease breaking out. It depressingly, predictably happens that it causes trade barriers that are themselves damaging and possibly perverse in their outcomes.

"You might shut off the trading route from a safe trading partner because of avian influenza, and open up a different trading route with a new partner who will bring you a whole host of different endemic diseases that you'd rather not have."

Since the so-called Guangdong strain of HPAI [highly pathogenic avian influenza] had emerged in China in 2004, there had been waves of infection, exacerbated by the extensive trade in live poultry and the fact it can replicate in free-range ducks, without any symptoms showing, said Prof Brown.

"The evolution and changing epidemiology of the H5 virus over time has also made it really difficult for us to select and use the right vaccines.

"In the mid- to late-1990s we had relatively little variation, but over time we see more genetic diversity. That's because we've had truly global spread, we have a virus that becomes established in the ecosystem and evolves independently.

"The epidemiology has become more complicated because of this virus's ability to pick up genes readily from other strains."

Wild birds certainly played a role as a primary source of the disease. "But sometimes this gets out of perspective and they are blamed for spreading an outbreak when there is no epidemiological evidence to support that."

The actual spread was often down to things like live bird movement, trade in contaminated product, and vehicle movements.

"Controlling the disease must be about preventing incursion and spread in the 1st place. We have to refocus our efforts back on biosecurity.

"H5 HPAI is truly panzootic. It is continually changing. The virus continues to be ahead of us. It's got creative in how it can persist and spread, and it has truly become endemic. Our prospects for immediate control are, unfortunately, bleak."

[Professor Brown's view on the (bleak) short-term prospects for the control of H5 HPAI is cause for concern as well as for enhanced research efforts. Dr Gibbens's comments, addressing the possible negative impact of trade restrictions officially imposed upon international trade, in relation to reported HPAI outbreaks, deserve to be discussed and assessed within the relevant international agencies. In fact, the inclusion of the compartmentalisation principle within the optional OIE requirements applied by infected countries, was a significant, positive step in this spirit. See, in OIE's International Code, chapters 4.4. (Application of compartmentalization; http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_application_compartment.htm) and 10.4. (Infection with avian influenza viruses; http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_avian_influenza_viruses.htm).

As to the current HPAI H5N1 situation, subscribers are referred to recent media reports from Turkey on suspected H5N1 spread into the Kayseri province in central Anatolia, which is located rather distant from the previous outbreaks officially reported from western Turkey (http://www.dunya.com/toplum/toplumsal-haber/kayserideki-kus-gribi-suphesi-265403h.htm and http://www.bugun.com.tr/son-dakika/kayseride-kus-gribi-iddiasi-haberi/1689726, in Turkish; thanks to Nati Elkin).
