Health officials urge health care providers to watch for rare illness. The fungus that causes "valley fever" (coccidioidomycosis) has for the 1st time been detected in soil samples in Washington [State], much further north than its expected range.

The valley fever fungus, called _Coccidioides [immitis]_, is typically found in the semiarid climates of the south west United States, such as Arizona and California, and in Central and South America. The fungus lives in the soil and its spores can be breathed in when dirt is disturbed by digging, excavating, or dust storms. Inhaling the fungus can make people sick.

In 2010 and 2011, the [Washington] State Department of Health received reports of 3 unrelated cases of valley fever in residents of Walla Walla, Benton, and Franklin counties. These people hadn't recently traveled out of state. An investigation conducted by local and state health officials determined that these patients were most likely exposed in south-central Washington. The Department of Health and Benton-Franklin Health District collected and preserved soil samples from the suspected exposure locations in Benton County.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) along with colleagues at Translational Genomics Research Institute in Flagstaff, Arizona, recently developed the 1st method to test soil samples for the fungus. Test results showed that the soil samples were positive for the valley fever fungus, and that these cultures genetically matched samples of the fungus obtained from one of the patients. This confirmed that the patients were exposed in Washington.

These findings are important because the valley fever fungus has never before been found in Washington soil. However, DNA analysis suggests that the fungus has been here for a while. There is still much to learn about the extent of this fungus in the environment in Washington. Yet, state public health officials want to remind people that only a few cases of valley fever are reported among Washington residents each year, and nearly all who develop the illness have recently traveled to the south west or Mexico.

"The risk of getting the disease in Washington appears to be very low, and we're working with local health partners to track and investigate cases of the disease," said state health officer Dr Kathy Lofy at the Department of Health. "We're developing a plan for additional soil testing, which we hope will provide us with a better understanding of the environmental conditions that support the growth of the valley fever fungus in our state."

The Department of Health is working with local public health agencies and CDC to notify health care providers about the potential for locally acquired valley fever. The agency has notified health professionals and laboratories, asking them to report cases and send positive cultures to public health officials. Because valley fever can also affect animals, the advisory was sent to veterinarians statewide. Reporting human and animal illnesses helps health officials identify and investigate potential in-state exposure sites.

Most people exposed to the valley fever fungus don't become ill, but some develop a mild flu-like illness with fever, cough, headache, and body aches or pneumonia. Less commonly, people can develop more severe infections including meningitis, bone or joint infections, skin lesions, or chronic pneumonia. Health care providers can test and treat patients with antifungal medications, though mild illnesses often get better without any treatment. The disease is not spread from person to person.

[Coccidioidomycosis is a fungal infection that occurs in hot, semi-arid regions in the south western United States (mainly the states of Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas, but also Nevada and Utah), parts of northern Mexico, and in Central and South America. It is caused by _Coccidioides immitis_ and _C. posadasii_, 2 nearly identical species of pathogenic fungi that grow in the top 2-8 inches [5 to 20cm] of soil where the organism produces arthroconidia that can be disrupted and become airborne during conditions that disturb the soil. The airborne spores then can travel great distances by currents of air. The airborne spores can be inhaled and produce an acute infection in humans, as well as other animals.

The number of reported cases of coccidioidomycosis in Arizona and California has risen dramatically over the past decade (https://www.vfce.arizona.edu/resources/pdf/2011_coccidioidomycosis_epi.pdf). This increase has been attributed in part to climate change, soil disturbance due to construction for this endemic region's rising population, and an influx of susceptible new residents into the population, such as military recruits on training bases in Southern California, elderly people who go to live in Arizona retirement communities, and prisoners from urban ghettos, as well as increased travel and tourism to this endemic region (Ampel NM. What's behind the increasing rates of coccidioidomycosis in Arizona and California? Curr Infect Dis Rep. 2010; 12(3): 211-6 DOI 10.1007/s11908-010-0094-3; abstract available at http://pubget.com/paper/21308532/What_s_Behind_the_Increasing_Rates_of_Coccidioidomycosis_in_Arizona_and_California).

This news report refers to a recent publication of Marsden-Haug N, Hill H, Litvintseva AP, et al. Notes from the field: _Coccidioides immitis_ identified in soil outside of its known range -- Washington, 2013. MMWR 2014; 63(20): 450, May 23. Available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6320a3.htm.

In 2010-2011, 3 unrelated cases of coccidioidomycosis were diagnosed in residents of south central Washington State (at the intersection of Walla Walla, Benton, and Franklin counties), which has a semiarid climate with hot summers and few winter freezes and sandy soil that is favorable for _Coccidioides_ growth. The patients had not traveled within 22 months of illness onset to known coccidioidomycosis-endemic regions before becoming ill (Marsden-Haug N, Goldoft M, Ralston C, et al. Coccidioidomycosis acquired in Washington state. Clin Infect Dis. 2013; 56: 847-50). Soil samples were obtained from 2 locations in Benton County, Washington, where 2 patients described falling or playing in the dirt and from nearby rodent burrows and snake holes. _Coccidioides_ DNA was detected in 6 of 22 soil samples by PCR and viable _C. immitis_ was isolated from 4 of the 6 soil samples. Genotypes of the environmental isolates were identical to a clinical isolate from one patient, which is evidence that _C. immitis_ exists in this environment clearly outside the recognized endemic area and that the infections were acquired in Washington State. For a map showing the location of counties in Washington State, see http://www.coilgun.info/rover_wa/county_map_wa.htm.

The majority of patients who become infected following exposure are asymptomatic, but have immunological evidence of coccidioidomycosis. Within some endemic communities in the central valley of California, nearly the entire population has serological evidence of prior infection. It would be interesting to know the frequency of immunologic evidence of prior coccidioidomycosis in populations living in south central Washington State. - Mod.ML
