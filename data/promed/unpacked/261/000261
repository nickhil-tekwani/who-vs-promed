----------------------------------------------------------------------
Louse-borne relapsing fever (LRF) was once widely distributed in all geographic areas, including Europe and North America, occurring in association with poverty and overcrowding. In Europe, it virtually disappeared after World War I in parallel with improved living conditions that led to substantially decreased body lice infestations in humans (1). Currently, LRF is reported mostly from Ethiopia and surrounding countries, where it is endemic (2): in this region, it is an extremely common infection with substantial mortality. The causative agent is the spirochete bacterium _Borrelia recurrentis_. In nature, the only relevant vector is the body louse, which feeds only on humans; no other reservoir for this infection is known (1,3). The incubation period is 3-12 days. We report 5 cases of LRF in refugees to Italy from East Africa that occurred during 2015.

The cases
---------
All 5 patients were young men from Somalia (Table [for table and figures, see source URL above. - Mod.LL]). Patients 1, 4, and 5 had recently arrived in Italy after traveling from Somalia through Kenya, Uganda, and Sudan to Libya, where they boarded a boat to Sicily (Figure 1). Patients 2 and 3 had resided in Italy since 2011, and both denied any travel outside Europe in the past 4 years. These 2 men lived in the same building in Turin, occupied by about 600 refugees of different nationalities, most of them from Somalia. Patients 4 and 5 also reported a short stay in the same building.

All patients sought care at one of the city emergency departments (EDs), reporting a 2-4-day history of fever with chills and headache. Other common symptoms included vomiting, myalgia, and abdominal pain. One patient had diarrhea. Routine blood exams, performed on all 5 men, showed marked thrombocytopenia (22 000-48 000/microL) and elevated C-reactive protein (values 16-115 times the upper reference value). Procalcitonin, measured in 3 patients, was markedly increased (11.4-21 ng/mL [reference less than 0.5 ng/mL]). Liver function tests and bilirubin were either normal or slightly elevated.

All patients were transferred to the Infectious Disease Hospital in Torino for further assessment. Giemsa-stained thin and thick blood smears were negative for malaria parasites but showed spirochetes (Figure 2). LRF was suspected, and the patients were treated with either doxycycline alone or doxycycline plus ceftriaxone. Patients 1 and 5 showed an acute febrile reaction after the 1st antimicrobial dose: symptoms were compatible with a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction (JHR) [see below].

No lice were found on the patients or on their clothes; patient 5 had skin lesions caused by scratching. None of the patients had rash or bleeding as described in the literature (3). Hepatomegaly was not observed; only patient 4 showed an enlarged spleen at ultrasound. Tachycardia was common, but alterations of cardiac function were not observed (no murmurs, corrected QT interval in normal range). A low systolic blood pressure (less than 90 mm Hg) was observed only in patient 4.

Bacterial DNA was extracted from 200 microL of blood from each of the 5 patients by using the QIAmp Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) and was detected amplifying the 16S rRNA. Nucleotide sequences of PCR products were determined. Sequences were identified by BLAST (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). _B. recurrentis_ was identified in all patients, showing 100 percent identity with sequences of _B. recurrentis_ reference strain A1 (GenBank accession nos. NR074866 and CP000993).

Italy has recently received large numbers of refugees from East Africa, particularly from Somalia. These refugees come from and travel through countries where _B. recurrentis_ is endemic; along the way, they are often sheltered in crowded conditions with very poor hygienic facilities. 2 of the patients reported here indicated that, while staying in Libya, they were held with many other persons in a close environment, and all refugees housed together reported severe itching.

Many of these refugees enter Italy through Sicily, from where they are sent to reception centers throughout the country. Some of these reception centers have grown to substantial size and now house a more stable population, with continuous input of new arrivals. In these conditions, local transmission can occur with a possible risk for epidemics: 2 of the 5 patients reported here were long-term residents in Italy, and they denied recent travel to Africa, so they probably acquired the infection while being housed in the same facilities as the newly arrived refugees. Although it is possible that they denied recent travel for fear of legal consequences, they are unlikely to have had the opportunity to travel out of Europe for economic reasons.

We did not find any louse on the body or in the clothing of these patients. However, we identified _B. recurrentis_ by gene sequencing, and the dynamic of transmission we postulate in our cases fits more closely the model of louse transmission (overcrowding, poor hygienic conditions, migration) than that of tick transmission (1,3,4). Lice are relatively short-lived and remain infected throughout their lives but cannot transmit borreliae to their progeny. They do not inject borreliae directly while feeding (infection takes place when they are crushed on skin) (1): infected lice can survive on uninfected persons but, when moved to other persons, give rise to infection. Thus, identifying a direct chain of transmission is often challenging. The presence of lice has been reported as a growing problem in western Europe homeless persons with no history of travel, threatening an alarming scenario (4,5).

All 5 patients reported here sought care at one of the EDs in Turin for fever associated with other nonspecific symptoms; all 5 diagnoses were made as occasional observations of spirochetes on thin and thick blood smears conducted to search for malaria parasites. These 5 patients might represent a minority of persons who are actually affected by relapsing fever. In fact, in many instances, persons seen at an ED for fever, especially persons without a history of recent travel to malaria-endemic countries, would not be investigated for malaria and would probably be treated empirically with antimicrobial drugs, leading to resolution of symptoms without further investigations.

2 of the patients we report had symptoms suggestive of a JHR. JHR is an acute, febrile reaction, potentially fatal, occurring shortly after starting antimicrobial drugs, probably attributable to the release of cytokines associated with clearance of borreliae from blood (2,6). A higher frequency of JHR has been reported in the literature, up to 80 percent (6,7), with some differences depending on the antimicrobial drug used (7,8). However, most observations were performed in LRF-endemic countries. These patients were all hospitalized and were receiving supportive treatment (intravenous rehydration and paracetamol, either intravenously or orally, to control headache, myalgia, and abdominal pain), which might have played a role in avoiding JHRs or in reducing its symptoms. Several studies have been conducted on possible preventive options to avoid the arousal of JHR, but results have not been consistent (9). Some clue of a possible action of paracetamol on the development of JHR has been reported (8).

Conclusions
-----------
In summary, we identified _B. recurrentis_ infection in 5 patients in Italy who were refugees from East Africa; 2 of these patients had not traveled outside Italy for several years. Beginning in July 2015, several reports from countries in Europe have described relapsing fever in refugees from East Africa (10-13). In some of these cases, transmission might have occurred during transit through Italy (12). Our findings confirm the possibility of local transmission of LRF caused by _B. recurrentis_.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
During the early 20th century, at the end of World War I, and during World War II, louse-borne relapsing fever (LBRF) caused by _Borrelia recurrentis_ was a major public health problem, especially in eastern Europe and northern Africa (1,2). Currently, poor living conditions, famine, war, and refugee camps are major risk factors for epidemics of LBRF in resource- poor countries, such as those in the Horn of Africa (3,4).

Increased migration from resource-poor countries and war/violence create new routes for spread of vector-borne diseases. Recently, several cases of LBRF have been reported among asylum seekers from Eritrea in the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Germany (5-8). All of these asylum seekers had been in refugee camps in Libya or Italy. We report 3 cases of LBRF in migrants from Somalia to refugee camps in Sicily, Italy.

Patient 1 was a 13-old-boy from Somalia who arrived in Palermo, Italy, on 11 Jul 2015, after traveling though Libya. He was admitted to G Di Cristina Hospital in Palermo 5 days after arrival because of high fever, headache, and general malaise, which developed 2 days after arrival. The patient had skin lesions on his fingers and legs and a conjunctival infection. He had thrombocytopenia (79 000 platelets/microL), creatine phosphokinase level 967 mg/L [reference range 0.001 mg/L-0.10 mg/L], aspartate aminotransferase level 30 U/L (reference value 37 U/L), and alanine aminotransferase level 21 U/L (reference value 41 U/L). He was given ceftriaxone (2 g/d) and intravenous hydration. His conditions worsened about 10 hours after treatment: high fever (temperature 40 deg C [104 deg F]), chills, and profuse sweating (Jarish-Herxheimer reaction). The patient recovered after 15 days of treatment with ceftriaxone. A Giemsa-stained blood smear was negative for _Plasmodium_ spp but showed large numbers of spirochetes. Serologic screening results for _B. burgdorferi_ were negative.

Patient 2 was a 17-old-boy from Somalia who arrived in Lampedusa, Italy, on 27 Aug 2015, after traveling through Libya. Fever and artromyalgia developed 6 days after his arrival, and he was admitted to Hospital Paolo Giaccone in Palermo. Blood analyses showed increased levels of aminotransferases, thrombocytopenia (69 000 platelets/microL), and mild anemia (hemoglobin level 94 g/L [reference range 130 g/L-160 g/L]). A blood smear was negative for _Plasmodium_ spp but positive for spirochetes. Serologic screening results were negative for malaria, leptospirosis, infection with _Rickettsia conorii_, and dengue. An ELISA result was positive for _B. burgdorferi_, and a Western blot result was positive for _Borrelia spp_ proteins p10, p41, and OspC. The patient recovered after treatment with doxycycline (100 mg/d) and ceftriaxone (2 g/d) for 10 days.

Patient 3 was a 17-year-old boy from Somalia who arrived in Trapani, Italy, on 4 Sep 2015. He reported that he stayed for 5 months in Libya before arriving in Italy. Fever, artromyalgia, severe dehydration, renal failure, and mental confusion developed 3 days after his arrival, and he was admitted to Hospital Paolo Giaccone. He had severe thrombocytopenia (4000 platelets/microL); mild anemia (hemoglobin level 88 g/L); increased levels of aminotransferases (aspartate aminotransferase 282 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 489 U/L), lactate dehydrogenase (1041 U/L [reference range 105 U/L-333 U/L]), d-dimer (6311 ng/mL [reference range 10 ng/mL-250 ng/mL]), C-reactive protein (237.8 mg/dL [reference range 0 mg/dL-10 mg/dL]), and creatinine (2.6 mg/dL [reference range 0.6 mg/dL-1.2 mg/dL]); and azotemia (blood urea nitrogen level 150 mg/dL [reference range 7 mg/dL-20 mg/dL]). A blood smear was negative for _Plasmodium spp_, but a Giemsa-stained thick blood smear was positive for spirochetes. Serologic screening results were negative for malaria, leptospirosis, infection with _B. burgdorferi_, and dengue. The patient recovered after treatment with doxycycline (100 mg/d) and ceftriaxone (2 g/d) for 10 days.

DNA was extracted from blood specimens from the 3 patients and used for molecular identification and characterization of the etiologic agent of LBRF. We used a species-specific real-time PCR for _B. recurrentis_ and _B. duttonii_, which targeted an internal region of the recN gene. Multispacer sequence typing of the 16S rRNA gene was used for bacterial identification and genotyping (9,10). All blood samples were positive for _B. recurrentis_ by real-time PCR. Multispacer sequences showed 100 percent identity with sequences of _B. recurrentis_ reference strain A1 (GenBank accession no. CP000993) for isolates from all patients.

We report 3 patients in Italy with LBRF who migrated from Somalia. These patients arrived in Italy after traveling in several countries in Africa and crossing the Mediterranean Sea. The patients did not associate with each other during travel, and the place where they were infected is unknown. However, because they came from a disease-endemic country, they probably had been infested with body lice and were infected with _B. recurrentis_ in Somalia or other neighboring countries.

Because the 3 cases we observed might indicate that more migrants and refugees are infected, LBRF should be considered an emerging disease among migrants and refugees. Diagnostic suspicion of LBRF should lead to early diagnosis among refugees from the Horn of Africa and in persons in migrant camps. Furthermore, improved public health measures and hygiene must be implemented for persons in refugee or migrant camps.

[Italy now joins Germany, Switzerland, and the Netherlands as countries that have diagnosed louse-borne relapsing fever in asylum seekers from the horn of Africa.

The 1st of these 2 Emerging Infectious Diseases reports from Italy documents that 2 of the 5 cases were not in recent asylum seekers but rather in native Africans who had been in Italy for a number of years but lived in Turin in the same facility as those newly arrived. Although no body lice were found, it is certainly likely that these 2 were autochthonous in origin.

It should be noted that the body louse (_Pediculus humanus humanus_) might be better referred to as the clothing louse because it does not live on the human body but rather on the clothes and travels to the body for frequent blood meals. It attaches its eggs to clothing, not to the body or hair, often on the inner belts of underwear, pants, or skirts. When removed from the body, even in the absence of insecticides, the unwashed clothes will [lose all] viable lice and eggs within 7 days. Raoult and Roux (1) cite Maunder (2), who hypothesized that religious Sabbath and Sunday ritual days of rest with a change of clothes could [have contributed] to a delousing cycle.
