Patients across the nation continue to face considerable risk from medical scopes linked to deadly bacterial outbreaks due to basic design flaws and a lack of easy fixes, a federal panel was warned Thursday [14 May 2015].

Testimony from physicians and researchers came as the Food and Drug Administration and Olympus Corp., a leading scope manufacturer, took a barrage of criticism for allowing this situation to unfold in hospital after hospital.

A day of highly technical presentations was punctuated by the tearful testimony from a North Carolina widow who lost her husband to a superbug infection. "His battle was more than I could bear to watch," [the widow] recalled. She singled out the FDA and Olympus, saying: "They have failed me, my family, and my husband paid the ultimate price with his life."

In the 1st day of testimony before the FDA advisory committee, the agency defended its response to the outbreaks and reiterated that the benefits of these difficult-to-clean duodenoscopes continue to outweigh the risks of infection. The committee is expected to hear Friday [15 May 2015] from more medical experts on cleaning alternatives and consider recommendations on how the FDA should respond to this issue.

Meanwhile, Olympus, which manufactured the scopes implicated in at least 6 outbreaks, refused to take on its critics and declined to participate in the FDA hearing.

The devices are used in a procedure called ERCP, or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. About 670 000 ERCP procedures were performed in the U.S. last year [2014].

The news of an outbreak at UCLA's Ronald Reagan Medical Center in February [2015] raised alarms nationwide and prompted an FDA alert the next day. A UCLA doctor testified about the incident on Thursday [14 May 2015] and disclosed that another L.A. patient had died from the initial outbreak. Dr. Zachary Rubin, director of clinical epidemiology and infection prevention at UCLA, said that 8 patients had become infected with the CRE [carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae] superbug from 2 contaminated scopes, and 3 of them have died.

Both Rubin and a doctor from a Seattle hospital struck by a similar outbreak agreed that the problem of scope-related infections is bigger than what has been reported thus far. They both described the difficulty in detecting the infections even with sophisticated staff and considerable resources that many community hospitals would lack.

"If you don't look for these infections," Rubin said, "you won't find them."

The most gripping testimony came from [the wife of a patient], an accountant from Statesville, N.C. She described how her husband had died at age 55 from a CRE infection that he got from a duodenoscope. [She] asked why it had taken federal regulators years to determine there was such a significant risk from the device. She said she disagreed with the often-repeated claim of the FDA and doctors that the benefits of ERCP far outweigh the low risk of infection. "For me and my family, this comment is absurd," she said.

Later in the hearing, FDA official Suzanne Schwartz paused before her scheduled presentation and turned back to the audience to thank this patient's wife for sharing her experience. "There's no way I can even begin to understand and feel the pain and suffering you've had to endure as a result of your husband's passing," Schwartz said. "Our FDA team is committed to getting this right." A spokesman for Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte, N.C., where [the patient] was treated, declined to comment, citing patient privacy laws.

The 3 U.S. manufacturers of duodenoscopes -- Olympus, Pentax Medical and Fujifilm -- all declined to speak at the hearing. Mark Miller, an Olympus spokesman who attended the meeting, said the company is continuing to talk directly with FDA officials. The company "will evaluate whether to provide written input" to the advisory panel after the hearing, he said. Pentax said that patient safety is its "number one focus" and that it will continue to work with regulators to address any concerns. Fujifilm couldn't be reached for comment.

Doctors testified that the scopes could transfer pathogens of all types to patients, but that outbreaks from CRE had been noticed because the bacteria is unusual and especially lethal. "This is just the tip of the iceberg," said Margreet Vos, a doctor from Erasmus University Medical Center in Rotterdam, which had an outbreak linked to an Olympus scope in early 2012. [See prior ProMED-mail post Carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli - Europe: ERCP endoscope, 2012 Archive Number: 20150514.3359072.]

Because of that outbreak in the Netherlands, Olympus in January 2013 sent a letter to European hospitals warning that its device was especially hard to clean. It did not send a similar warning in the U.S. until 2 years later.

Vos showed photos of the brown scaly deposits that investigators had found inside the Olympus device when they later dismantled it. The investigators had blamed the problem on an o-ring that was expected to seal the device's elevator channel so that it could be more easily cleaned.

Dr. Stephen Ostroff, the FDA's acting commissioner, said the goal of the meeting was to assure doctors and their patients that the scopes could be used safely. "As we address the problem of duodenoscope-associated infections," Ostroff said, "we have to do so in a manner that doesn't disrupt medical care.

[The FDA said that it has received 142 adverse event reports of contaminated devices and possible patient infections since 2010 (ProMED-mail post Antibiotic-resistant Enterobacteriaceae - USA (04) ERCP endoscopes, update 20150513.3358689). However, as pointed out in the news report above, the number of patients involved could be far higher than 142 because one adverse event report may include numerous people. In addition, the number of cases is likely even higher, because ERCP duodenoscopes can transfer all types of pathogens, including antibiotic-susceptible bacteria and viruses, like hepatitis B and C, which may have been overlooked, whereas CRE infections are more likely to be noticed because they are multidrug resistant, and the infections they cause are more likely to be fatal.

I would be interested to know why ethylene oxide or a similar disinfectant gas does not work effectively for these instruments. - Mod.JW
