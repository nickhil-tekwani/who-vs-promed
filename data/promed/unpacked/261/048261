Six confirmed cases of a serious _Escherichia coli_ infection and 4
additional "suspected" cases are being looked into by the Tennessee
Department of Health, according to Debbie Hoy of the Agency's Cookeville
office this Tue, 27 Jun 2006. All of the infected children, ages 5 and
under, attended the same day care facility, west of Lafayette.
"Most of the 6 children with confirmed cases have been released from Sumner
Regional Medical Center or treated by their family doctor and sent home with
their parents," said Ms Hoy. Two children, a girl aged 3 and a 16 month old
boy, remain in Vanderbilt Children's Hospital where they are receiving
treatment.
An additional 4 young children have shown symptoms but have not become
dangerously ill from the _E. coli_ strain of infection, which can lead to
serious complications including damage to the kidneys.
"The day care center voluntarily closed for the time being as a safety
procedure and to make sure everything was thoroughly cleaned and sanitary
before children return to avoid the possibility of further infections," said
Ms Hoy.
One child became ill nearly a week before other children at the facility
began to show symptoms. Officials speculate that the 1st child may have
infected toys, linens or other items from which the other children were
infected. The bacterial infection is so aggressive that simple hand washing
is not enough to prevent its spread, especially if hand-to-mouth activity
immediately follows the initial exposure.
Because the virulent strain of _E. coli_ is easily transmitted from person
to person, the day care center operator voluntarily closed her facility when
additional children showed symptoms of infection.
State officials are actively investigating the source of the infection, but
Colter's facility has received good health and safety inspections in the
past and has a history of adhering to high standards for the day care
industry. The day care facility in Lafayette has been in continuous
operation for nearly 20 years.

[ProMED-mail thanks Pablo Nart for alerting us to this cluster. Day care
centers can be "hotbeds" for transmission of gastrointestinal and
respiratory diseases from child to child despite high standards of child
care.
