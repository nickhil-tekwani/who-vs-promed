Tickborne disease cases reported in Sweden
------------------------------------------
So far this summer [2010], 9 cases of tickborne encephalitis (TBE) have
been reported to the Institute for Infectious Disease Control
(Smittskyddinstitutet, SMI), with forecasts for the season dependent on the
weather. All the cases come from an already endemic area in central Sweden
and the 1st was reported in the last week of April [2010].

"It is difficult to predict how the season will develop as both tick and
human behaviour are heavily affected by the weather," wrote Marika
Hjertqvist, an epidemiologist in the department of epidemiology at SMI.
During the same period last year [2009], 11 cases were reported.

The SMI has released guidelines on how to avoid being bitten by ticks for
those who frequent exposed areas: 'When in exposed areas, boots and long
trousers should be worn with the legs tucked into boots. A shirt tucked
into at the waist is also an effective means of preventing bites', the
institute writes. As it takes some time for a tick to burrow itself into a
carrier, one should closely inspect one's body on a daily basis to look for
ticks that may be crawling around looking for a crevice to attach itself
to. Showering is also recommended after a period of time spent in a
tick-infested area.

TBE vaccinations are recommended for permanent residents, summer residents,
and residents who reside in the forest and fields in areas with a risk of
infection. Even travellers planning to visit Aland, the Baltic countries,
or specific risk areas in Central and Eastern Europe should be vaccinated.

TBE is a viral infectious disease affecting the central nervous system. The
virus can infect the brain (encephalitis), the meninges (meningitis), or
both (meningoencephalitis). Mortality is 1 to 2 per cent, with deaths
typically occurring 5 to 7 days after the onset of neurological symptoms.
Although TBE is most commonly recognized as a neurological disorder, mild
fever can also occur.

The number of reported cases has increased in most countries. The disease
is incurable and there is no specific drug therapy for TBE. TBA vaccine is
effective and available in some endemic areas.

[Tickborne encephalitis (TBE) virus is a single-stranded RNA virus that
belongs to the genus _Flavivirus_ and has 3 subtypes: European, Siberian,
and Far Eastern. The European subtype is transmitted through the bite of an
infected tick of the _Ixodes_ species, _Ixodes ricinus_. The virus is
maintained in discrete areas of deciduous forest where both the tick
vectors and animal hosts (mainly rodents) are found. TBE is endemic in
temperate regions of Europe with highest incidences reported in Austria,
Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland,
Russia, Slovenia, Sweden, and Switzerland. No cases have been reported in
Belgium, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, or the
United Kingdom.

Most cases of TBEs occur from April to November, with peaks in early and
late summer when ticks are active. The incidence and severity of disease
are highest in people over 50 years of age. In the past 30 years, the
geographic range of TBEV and the numbers of reported TBE cases have
increased significantly. Nonetheless the overall risk of acquiring TBE for
an unvaccinated visitor to an endemic area during the TBEV transmission
season has been estimated at 1 case per 10 000 person-months of exposure.
Most TBEV infections result from tick bites acquired in forested areas. The
risk is negligible for people who remain in urban or unforested areas and
who do not consume unpasteurized dairy products. For more detailed
