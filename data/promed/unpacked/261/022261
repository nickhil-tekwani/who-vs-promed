[1] El Jadida: 2nd outbreak, bovine

The Regional Director of the National Health Security Office of foodstuffs (ONSSA) for Casablanca-Settat, Abdallah Ossoual, declared on [Sun 8 Nov 2015] that at least one case of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] was diagnosed in a cattle herd in Saed hamlet, Al Haouzia district, in El Jadida province. This finding was confirmed through laboratory testing carried out on [Sat 7 Nov 2015] within the ongoing FMD surveillance program.

Ossoual added that his directorate, together with the local authorities and the Department of Agriculture of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, proceeded on [Mon 9 Nov 2015] morning with the destruction of the infected cow in addition to the in-contact animals, including 3 cows and 8 calves, to prevent the spread of the disease among livestock, as legally required.

ONSSA issued a report last week [week of 2 Nov 2015] confirming the emergence of FMD virus in Morocco and stressing that local veterinary services should activate the recommended control measures to curb the spread of this disease to other provinces. Among these measures is a ban on bringing affected farm animals as well as products of animal origin (milk and meat) into or out of the affected area and the on-site [destruction] of all infected or suspected-to-be-infected animals.

[2] Q&A: official's update

Abdallah Ossoual, director of the Regional Directorate of the National Health Security Office of foodstuffs (ONSSA) for Casablanca-Settat region revealed in an interview with Alyaoum24 the reasons for the emergence of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] virus in Morocco, the measures taken to eliminate it, and the number of cases and disease foci recorded so far.

Q: Recently, FMD virus appeared in Morocco. Can you give an overview on this virus and explain how it spreads among livestock?

A: FMD virus infects livestock, including cattle and small ruminants, and is not transmitted to humans; it differs completely from the virus which causes hand-foot-mouth disease in human beings.

The virus spreads rapidly among animals that have not been vaccinated against FMD. In turn, there is no risk of detecting the disease in vaccinated animals. That is why, although the infection is currently evolving in El Jadida, it did not hurt many cattle, because FMD vaccination has been implemented in this region. And here I want to reassure citizens that most cattle and sheep in Morocco have been vaccinated against the virus, either during the last year [2014] or this year [2015, sheep were not part of the vaccination program. - Mod.AB]. Currently, we are conducting a vaccination campaign to eradicate the virus; we have completed the vaccination of more than 2.5 million cattle up to now.

Q: In addition to the vaccination of cattle, what are the measures taken by the ONSSA to limit the spread of FMD virus?

A: ONSSA is continuously monitoring the health situation in cattle, and those suspected of carrying the virus are subjected to medical tests. Should the infection be confirmed, diseased animals as well as their contacts are immediately destroyed and burned in order to prevent the spread of the disease. Also, infected animals and all products of animal origin, such as milk and meat, are prevented from leaving the infected premises and remain under continuous control for 30 days. The same applies to neighboring farms, located about 10 km [6.4 miles] around.

Q: Are you facing any difficulties in making cattle owners whose livestock are infected adhere to your program?

A: No, on the contrary, cattle examination is performed normally, and, when a case is discovered, the owner allows the culling of his animal on site, because the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries will compensate the incurred losses with an amount of money up to 25 000 MDH [USD 2100] per head, a fairly good amount, I believe.

Q: How was the virus discovered, and had it been reported earlier in Morocco?

A: After the discovery of the virus in Tunisia in [April 2014], and in Algeria in [July 2014], Morocco implemented mass vaccination campaigns in livestock in most agricultural areas, but unfortunately, this did not prevent the virus from spilling over into Morocco as it did in 1999, before we were able to overcome the last FMD epizootic.

Q: How many farms have been affected by the disease so far, and what is the tally of infected cattle?

A: There have been 5 outbreaks, most of them in El Jadida province, and this resulted in the culling of about 52 cows as of today [9 Nov 2015].

[El Jadida is a coastal city located some 65 km [40.5 mi] from Sidi Bennour where the supposed index FMD outbreak was detected (see map indicating both locations at http://www.distancefromto.net/between/El+Jadida/Sidi+Bennour),

ProMED-MENA learned from private veterinarians that other FMD outbreaks have flared up in at least 2 other provinces of Casablanca-Settat region: Benguerir province and Settat province, with 3 disease outbreaks detected in each province; however, the information needs to be confirmed by veterinary officials.

Serotyping of the circulating virus strain has identified FMD virus serotype O as the cause of the epizootic. However, the identity of the virus' topotype and its genotyping results are still awaited to confirm, or otherwise, the similarity of this strain with the one having caused numerous FMD outbreaks in Tunisia, then Algeria, namely topotype ME-SA, lineage Ind-2001d. - Mod.AB

Morocco submitted its initial, immediate notification to the OIE, reporting the 1st outbreak (in Sidi Bennour) on 2 Nov 2015. The 1st (weekly) follow-up report is expected soon. - Mod.AS
