[According to Algeria's reporting to the OIE, PPR was diagnosed in February 2011 (7 outbreaks) and in February 2012 (3 outbreaks) in local sheep and goat flocks. In the absence of preventive vaccination, this may have been under-reporting.

The 2012 outbreaks took place in the same province as the current one (Ghardaia); as in the current outbreak, no culling/stamping out were applied, and no vaccination was permitted.

Once PPR starts its circulation in a country/zone without stamping out applied, it is likely to become endemic; effective quarantine measures combined with mass vaccinations are applied to reduce the incidence of clinical disease.

In 2008, the PPR virus was diagnosed in Morocco as lineage IV -- causing a major epizootic -- by OIE's reference laboratory for rinderpest and peste des petits ruminants [PPR]. It will be a surprise if a different strain is involved in the current event.
