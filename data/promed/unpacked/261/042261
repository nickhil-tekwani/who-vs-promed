India accounts for the highest number of TB [tuberculosis] and multidrug resistant-TB [MDR-TB] cases in the world, according to a World Health Organization report.

The country accounts for 27 per cent of the cases, and though it ranks 14 and 15 among the 22 high-burden countries globally, due to its large population the percentage translates into a large number of cases, Health Minister J P Nadda informed the Lok Sabha today [28 Nov 2014] while quoting from the WHO Global TB Report, 2014 [available at: http://www.who.int/tb/publications/global_report/en/].

As per the data gathered by the government, the total number of TB cases was 1 416 014 in 2013, while the number of MDR-TB cases was 23 157.

Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra [states] reported the highest number of cases.

[WHO has published tuberculosis (TB) data for the year 2013 in the "WHO Global TB Report, 2014" that is available at: http://www.who.int/tb/publications/global_report/en/. Estimates of TB and multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB) burden are produced by WHO in consultation with countries. The prevalence of TB in India has steadily declined since about the year 2000 from 400-500 cases per 100 000 population in the 1990s to 211 per 100 000 in 2013; the annual incidence rate remained over 200 cases per 100 000 until the year 2005, when it began to fall; it was 171 per 100 000 in 2013. However, the diagnosis was confirmed bacteriologically in only 68 percent of new pulmonary TB cases; the rest were diagnosed clinically, probably because of the lack of laboratory facility.

WHO reports that India, with a population of 1.27 billion, has only 12 700 labs (1 laboratory per 100 000 population) capable of diagnosis of TB by acid fast staining of a specimen (e.g., sputum smear). Only 51 labs (0.2 labs per 5 million population) are capable of diagnosing TB by culture or are capable of drug susceptibility testing; and only 54 labs in India are capable of rapid diagnosis of multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB). WHO reports that 2.2 percent of new TB cases and 15 percent of retreated TB cases were diagnosed with MDR-TB. If all TB patients had been tested for drug resistance in 2013, many more cases of MDR-TB likely would have been detected. 5 percent of TB cases tested were found to be co-infected with HIV in 2013.
