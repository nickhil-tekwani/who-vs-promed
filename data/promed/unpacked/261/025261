Date of confirmation of the event: 18 Nov 2020
Reason for notification: reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 20 Jun 2020

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1 (LPAI_4_2020_PV): Gallivola, Pavia, Lombardia [Lombardy]
Date of start of the outbreak: 17 Nov 2020
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds / 11 214 / 8 / - / - / -
Affected population: the positivity concerns a breeding of _Gallus gallus_ and ducks located in the municipality of Galliavola, in the province of Pavia.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: The positivity concerns a breeding of _Gallus gallus_ and ducks located in the municipality of Galliavola, in the province of Pavia. So far, positivity has only been confirmed on a serological basis by H5 subtype specific haemagglutination inhibition tests. No clinical signs or increased mortality were reported in this flock. Further investigations and sampling are underway to detect the active circulation of the virus and to identify and characterize the strain responsible for seroconversion. Based on the absence of clinical signs, it is believed that seropositivity can be attributed to an LPAI infection.

Control measures
Measures applied: surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; traceability; official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste; stamping out; disinfection; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Experimental Zooprophylactic Institute (IZS) of Venice, Padua (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Birds / haemagglutination inhibition test (HIT) / 18 Nov 2020 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[In June 2020, Italy detected one outbreak of LPAI subtype H5N3. The affected population was an ostrich farm located in the municipality of Suzzara, Province of Mantova, Region of Lombardy.

This event was resolved on 20 Jun 2020. See the report and updated map at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000034819_20200625_114921.pdf

"Low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) viruses typically cause little or no clinical signs in infected poultry. The LPAI virus is excreted through infected birds' feces and respiratory secretions. It spreads primarily through direct contact between healthy and infected birds. It can also be spread through indirect contact with contaminated equipment and materials.

"To prevent cases of LPAI, poultry producers must use special preventative measures and precautions on the farm. If LPAI is detected, farms must be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. AI viruses are inactivated by heat and drying. They are also very sensitive to most disinfectants and detergents. To ensure thorough disinfection, organic material must first be cleaned from the environment". (Source: https://tinyurl.com/y6ev7lre). - Mod.CRD
