Downer cattle law signed
------------------------
Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed legislation Tuesday [22 Jul
2008] to crack down on the sale of downed cattle for human
consumption, in response to the largest beef recall in US history.

"I am committed to ensuring California's food supply is safe and
secure," Schwarzenegger said in a prepared statement after signing
Assembly Bill 2098. "With today's action, we are strengthening
California's food safety laws and sending a message that violating
these laws will not be tolerated."

Assembly Bill 2098, by Democratic Assemblyman Paul Krekorian of
Burbank, makes it a misdemeanor to buy, sell, process, or butcher a
non-ambulatory animal for human consumption.

The bill stemmed from the February [2008] recall of 143 million
pounds of beef from Westland/Hallmark Meat Co. after the Humane
Society of the United States surreptitiously videotaped aggression
against downed cattle at the Chino facility.

[For those members who cannot remember what all this was about, it
stems from an incident in mid-February 2008, when the USDA (US
Department of Agriculture) recalled 143 million pounds of frozen beef
because of downer cattle being routinely processed for school meals
at the Westland/Hallmark Meat Packing Co.. There were a number of
additional associated problems at this plant. A somewhat draconian
response by the governor and Assemblyman Krekorian, but in the present
concerns about BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) and vCJD
(variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) it is understandable. - Mod.MHJ]
