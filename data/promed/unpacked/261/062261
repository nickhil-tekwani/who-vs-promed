Togo confirms H5N1 bird flu virus at poultry farm
-------------------------------------------------
Laboratory tests have confirmed the presence of
the deadly H5N1 bird flu virus at a poultry farm
in the West African country of Togo, Agriculture
Minister Yves Nagou said on Friday [22 Jun 2007].
Samples from the semi-industrial farm at
Sigbehoue, about 45 km (28 miles) east of the
capital Lome, were sent for tests in neighbouring
Ghana after the sudden mass death of poultry at the site.

New bird flu outbreak confirmed
-------------------------------------
Laboratory tests in Ghana confirmed that the H5N1
avian flu virus caused the sudden deaths of 2000
chickens at a farm near Togo's capital Lome, the
World Health Organisation representative in Togo told IRIN on 22 Jun 2007.
It is the 1st time the virus has been detected in
Togo, the 7th West African nation to have
reported an outbreak. In neighbouring Nigeria,
more than one million birds have been destroyed
since the first outbreak there in February 2006;
the virus has since been confirmed in 22 of Nigeria's 36 states.
The farm in Togo, in the town of Sigbehoue, 45
km. [28 miles] east of Lome, had received a
shipment of chicks in February from neighbouring
Ghana, according to a Reuters report.
Avian flu was detected in Ghana last May [2007].
The virus is often passed from one region to
another when infected birds are transported for
sale, Katinka Debalogh, UN Food and Agriculture
Organisation's (FAO) Avian Flu response
coordinator told IRIN. FAO says the virus is also
spread through contaminated footwear, cages and egg crates.
"Industrial farms like this one [in Sigbehoue]
typically see a lot of movement of live animals,
so producers need to be careful about where the
birds are coming from," Debalogh said. "We're not
yet aware of the precautions that were taken by
the farm to prevent the disease, but commercial
farms in Africa are often lacking in sound bio-security measures," she added.
The area around the farm has reportedly been
quarantined and the remaining birds on the farm
have been culled to prevent the further spread of the disease.
FAO will send a response team to Lome on 23 Jun
2007 to assist the government in developing a
strategy to contain the outbreak. "Togo will need
to issue a decree preventing the movement of live
birds across borders and make sure the public is
aware of the risks," Debalogh said.

[Togo has yet to send its notification on the first HPAI outbreak to the OIE.
Ghana has sent its 7th follow-up report on 21 Jun 2007; it relates to
an outbreak in AFLAO (Volta province), where a farm of layers under an
intensive system of management was affected; out of the 1450 laying
hens, 350 died and the remaining 1100 have been culled. (see at:
