The Ministry of Health is reporting that the number of new confirmed
cases is trending downwards with an average of 2 cases recorded per
day since 21 Dec 2006.
In explaining, Dr. Sheila Campbell-Forrester, Chief Medical Officer
in the Ministry of Health said since 21 Dec 2006 there have been a
total of 10 new confirmed cases reflecting a decline compared to
previous weeks. Intensive house-to-house fever surveys and mosquito
control activities continue in affected areas. She said the teams
have made tremendous gains in finding and treating breeding sites.
Dr. Campbell-Forrester also said the addition of a Cuban Medical
Entomologist to the mosquito control team has enhanced the Ministry
of Health's mosquito control efforts. The gains to be made by the
Ministry in its malaria control efforts over the next weeks will
bring Jamaica much closer to its original malaria-free status.
Four Cuban officials arrived in Jamaica last week to aid in Jamaica's
malaria prevention and control efforts. The team consists of a
Medical Entomologist, a parasitologist and 2 laboratory technicians
to read smears at the laboratory. The Ministry of Health continues to
monitor the situation while conducting community interventions in
affected areas of the corporate area. The educational activities have
also been extended to the unaffected areas in Kingston and St. Andrew
as well as other parishes as the Ministry of Health seeks to prevent
further transmission.

Since the start of transmission, the National Public Health
Laboratory has processed over 6000 blood samples, with more than 5400
samples testing negative.
At the peak of the outbreak, the Ministry of Health had reported a 5
percent positive reading. However, according to Dr. Sheila
Campbell-Forrester, the recent daily rate of infection has been
reduced resulting in a 3 percent positive reading for all slides read to date.
"In fact, our daily positive rate has been reduced to less than 1,"
Dr. Campbell-Forrester reported.
She also said that the challenges faced by the Laboratory in the
initial phase of the outbreak have been addressed through
collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control in the United
States, as well as strengthening of technical support.
In explaining the technical support received Dr. Campbell-Forrester
said Jamaica is grateful to have received technical assistance from
Guyana and Cuba. She said the technical staffs provided by both
countries continue to assist tremendously in controlling the outbreak
through quick and efficient processing of samples.
Dr. Campbell-Forrester in commending the staff at the Laboratory said
they have been doing an excellent job since the start of the malaria
outbreak. She said that the Laboratory staff, as well as the teams
deployed in communities to do house-to-house surveys, mosquito
control activities and medical staff, worked tirelessly throughout
the holidays and must be commended for their acts of heroism.
Turning her attention to the continued effort to manage the outbreak,
Dr. Campbell-Forrester also said that the Ministry of Health is
committed to sustaining its vigilance in all areas.
"In this phase of the outbreak, strategies are being sustained. These
must be ongoing, we cannot let down our guard, as we must do second
tests to ensure persons treated are free of the parasites," Dr.
Campbell-Forrester said. Since the start of the outbreak 194 samples
have been tested positive for malaria.

[ProMED thanks Naomi Bryant for providing the links the Jamaican
Ministry of Health website. The announcements are not dated. There is
a discrepancy between the 194 cases cited above in the 2nd
announcement and the 43 cases cited from the RJR 94 Radio Jamaica
reported posted yesterday; the lower number cited yesterday is
probably more accurate, but this needs confirmation. - Mods.EP/MPP]
