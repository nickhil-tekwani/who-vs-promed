Surveys on_ Hop stunt viroid_ on hops in Slovenia and detection of an unexpected pathogen: _Citrus bark cracking viroid_
---------------------------------------------------------------------
In 2007, symptoms resembling those of _Hop stunt viroid_ (HSVd) were observed for the 1st time in Slovenia in hop (_Humulus lupulus_). Molecular tests confirmed the presence of HSVd in 2011 (see EPPO RS 2012/055) [ProMED-mail post 20120416.1102364].

Since 2011, measures have been adopted to prevent further spread of the disease. Systematic surveys have been carried out yearly. Despite the identification of HSVd in symptomatic plants, the disease in Slovenia presented some unusual characteristics [and] RT-PCR detection of HSVd was found to be unreliable.

Next generation sequencing (NGS) revealed the presence of another viroid, _Citrus bark cracking viroid_ (CBCVd), in symptomatic hop plants. Until this finding, CBCVd had only been described as a pathogen of citrus. Infection tests proved the high aggressiveness and infectivity of CBCVd on hop. On the basis of the latter and the results of NGS and RT-PCR from all infected hop gardens, CBCVd was recognized as the causal agent of this new viroid disease of hop, called 'severe hop stunt disease'.

The surveys revealed the presence of HSVd in 2012. In 2013 and 2014, HSVd was not detected. In contrast, all symptomatic plants (regardless of the sampling year) revealed the presence of CBCVd. Although HSVd was not the causal agent of the disease observed, its presence in symptomatic plants remains to be explained.

The majority of CBCVd outbreaks occurred near the initial outbreak site in Savinja valley, in the main hop-growing region. CBCVd was also detected in 2 other regions. Strict official measures are currently implemented to prevent any further spread and to eradicate both HSVd and CBCVd.

[_Hop stunt viroid_ (HSVd) is the type species of genus _Hostuviroid_ (family _Pospiviroidae_). It has been found infecting a wide range of both woody and herbaceous plants including hops, citrus, stone fruit species, grapevine, and pomegranate with symptoms ranging from latent to severe in different hosts. Specific sequence variants have been isolated from hop, almond, apricot, citrus, cucumber, grapevine, peach, pear, and plum. Economically important diseases caused by different strains of HSVd include hop stunt, citrus cachexia, cucumber pale fruit, peach dapple, and plum dapple.

Hop stunt disease is caused by the specific hop strains of HSVd, which have been reported to be very variable. Symptoms may include leaf chlorosis, stunting, and loss of plant vigour leading to yield losses. Infection also alters biochemical compounds within the plant that are responsible for flavour development during brewing. The disease was confined to Japan and North Korea, but in 2004 it was discovered in the USA and in 2007 in China. In Europe, hop stunt disease was reported for the 1st time in 2012 from Slovenia (see ProMED-mail post 20120416.1102364). While the hop disease is still restricted to few areas worldwide, HSVd-associated diseases of grapevine, citrus, and stone fruit are much more widespread, and a grapevine origin of the viroid has been suggested (ProMED-mail post 20140114.2171371).

_Citrus bark cracking viroid_ (genus _Cocadviroid_, family _Pospiviroidae_; CBCVd; previously _Citrus viroid-IV_) is one of at least 7 viroids of pospiviroidae known to occur in citrus species. It has now been added to the alert list of EPPO (see link below). Most viroids, including HSVd and CBCVd, can be spread by mechanical means, such as contaminated cutting tools and with infected plants or cuttings. Disease management may include phytosanitation (removal of infected plants, disinfection of orchard tools) and use of certified clean planting material.

Multiple viral or viroid infections are common in field plants with the potential for synergism (symbiotic enhancement of disease). Vegetative propagation which is used, for example, for hops and citrus, increases the risk of a build-up of these pathogens in a crop. Non-cachexia strains of HSVd and CBCVd co-inoculated into citrus species were shown to result in consistent and significant synergistic interaction on yield only when both viroids were exclusively present (see link below). Although it is stated above that HSVd was not always detected in symptomatic plants, this does not necessarily exclude the possibility of its presence at low levels and a synergistic co-infection with both viroids in the situation reported above.
