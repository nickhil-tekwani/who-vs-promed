[The news report below was not posted as there was no further mention of the
New Delhi outbreak subsequently in the Kathmandu Post, nor was there any
other report on this apparently severe influenza outbreak in New Delhi in
the media in India or elsewhere. Since a report of another outbreak of
undiagnosed fever has surfaced in Bangalore, India, and its possible
relationship to reported outbreaks in Afghanistan and Nepal, I am posting
part of the news report to add to the confusion (sorry about it). We really
do not know what is happening in the Indian subcontinent. - Mod. CYC

Health experts investigating the outbreak of viral influenza in Jumla and
Dolpa districts say that the cause behind the spreading of the disease could
be related to the outbreak in New Delhi where 200 people have succumbed to
the disease over the weekend.
"The untimely [outbreak of the disease, which usually spread only in hot
seasons in Nepal, may have been [due to the outbreak of the disease in New
Delhi this weekend," said Mahindra Bista, director of Epidemiology and
Disease Control Division.
