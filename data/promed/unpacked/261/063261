Pasteurellosis, a disease caused by commensal bacteria of the
respiratory tract of animals, has caused the deaths of more than 100
red deer in the provinces of Zamora and Leon in recent days.

Sources of the provincial government of Castile and Leon confirmed
this today [16 Aug 2010] in a statement indicating that measures will
be taken based on the report on the deaths of the animals developed
by the National Veterinary Center in Algete (Madrid) and sent today
to the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock.

As reported by the regional government last Friday [13 Aug 2010], an
estimated 2 percent of the population of red deer in Zamora -- a
total of 95 animals from the 4000-5000 living in the game reserves in
the province -- and 10 animals in the province of Leon have died in
recent days because of the disease.

The deaths of red deer started in the game reserve of the Sierra de
la Culebra and has expanded to 21 private reserves in the province,
some of them bordering Portugal, and the Sierra de la Cabrera in the
province of Leon.

The disease affects equally male and female red deer of all ages and
the carcasses have been located mainly in north west Zamora and south
west Leon. Animals suffer high fever and die next to ponds and lakes,
where they to go to cool off and drink water, or in areas with brooms
(a yellow flowering shrub) where they seek shelter from the heat.

[It is good to have a definitive diagnosis, which provides a very
plausible explanation for the high mortality of the red deer in Leon
and Zamora, Spain.

Pasteurellosis has been incriminated previous in cervid die-offs --
in pronghorns in the USA. See Dunbar MR, Wolcott MJ, Rimler RB, and
