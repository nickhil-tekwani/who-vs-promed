The Texas _Cyclospora_ outbreak is growing and more than half of the state's cases are in Travis County. People get the disease from eating fruits or vegetables contaminated with fecal matter. Health officials haven't pinpointed the source of the outbreak. _Cyclospora_ symptoms include: severe diarrhea, abdominal cramping, weight loss, and dehydration.

In the last 2 weeks, Texas has seen 72 cases of _Cyclospora_ and 37 of the cases are in Travis County. Dallas County has 5 cases, Harris County has 3 cases, and Williamson County has one case.

"I suspect, in Travis County, we probably have a healthier life style than some areas. In that regard, we do have more folks eating fresh fruits and vegetables," explains Albert Gross, MD and Chief Medical Officer at St David's South Austin Medical Center. While _Cyclospora_ is typically found on fruits and vegetables, the disease can also come from contaminated water. "With all of the rain and flooding we've had around here recently, there may be a connection with that as well," Gross adds.

The health department is interviewing Austinites infected with _Cyclospora_. They're trying to figure out what the patients have in common since the disease doesn't spread from person to person. "Specially, we're looking at places they may have eaten or common events they may have attended ... like they work at the same place or they attended the same wedding reception," says Jeff Taylor, an epidemiologist with Austin/Travis County Health and Human Services

The challenge is symptoms don't set in until 7-10 days after you've eaten the contaminated food. So without a good memory, it's possible the source of this outbreak could come and go without ever being identified.

The 2 suspects health officials are honing in on are cilantro and raspberries. Cilantro caused _Cyclospora_ outbreaks in Texas in 2014. Health officials recommend washing produce well before eating, but even then, it is difficult to remove all of the _Cyclospora_ spores. Cooking does kill the parasite. _Cyclospora_ is not typically life threatening.

[Infected humans excrete oocysts in their feces, which sporulate after days or weeks. The cysts are not infective before they have sporulated. Fresh produce and water can serve as vehicles for transmission if contaminated with sporulated oocysts, which are infective if ingested.

Very little data exist on potential animal reservoirs. However, one study from Nepal found _Cyclospora_ DNA in the feces from dogs, chicken, and one monkey (Chu DM et al: Detection of _Cyclospora cayetanensis_ in animal fecal isolates from Nepal using an FTA filter-base polymerase chain reaction method. Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2004; 71(4): 373-9; http://www.ajtmh.org/content/71/4/373.long).

Another study using microscopy of feces from animals including pigs, cattle, horses, goats, dogs, cats, guinea pigs, chicken, ducks, turkeys, and pigeons found no coccidian oocysts morphologically compatible with _C. cayetanensis_ (Eberhard ML et al: Survey for _Cyclospora cayetanensis_ in domestic animals in an endemic area in Haiti. J Parasitol. 1999; 85(3): 562-3; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10386455). No data on possible animal reservoirs are available from the United States.
