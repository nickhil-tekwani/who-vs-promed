[1] Waning immunity and re-infection?
Date: Sun 19 Jul 2020
Source: The Jerusalem Post [edited]
https://m.jpost.com/health-science/israeli-doctor-reinfected-with-coronavirus-3-months-after-recovering-635550/amp


A doctor at Sheba Medical Center in Tel Hashomer tested positive again for the novel coronavirus [SARS-CoV-2] 3 months after initially recovering from the disease. The doctor "tested positive again because she has remnants of her 1st virus still floating around in her body," a hospital spokesperson told The Jerusalem Post on Sunday [19 Jul 2020]. The doctor suffered from fever, cough, and muscle pain when she tested positive for the virus in April [2020], but she recovered and tested negative in May and June [2020]. Earlier this month [July 2020], she came in contact with a confirmed patient and subsequently tested positive for the virus.

The cases are the latest in a series of incidents of suspected reinfection that have raised questions concerning how long immunity against the virus lasts. In May [2020], a 45-year-old woman from Jisr e-Zarka tested positive for coronavirus after being readmitted to Hillel Yaffe Medical Center in Hadera, suffering from fever and chest pains. This came a month after she was discharged after recovering from the virus and testing negative twice [April 2020].

Several studies are attempting to figure out how long protection provided by antibodies will last, Dr Maria van Kerkhove, the World Health Organization's COVID-19 technical lead, said last week, adding that some initial studies have found they "may wane after a couple of months."

With coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS, people had some form of immunity for about a year or even longer, but with other human coronaviruses that circulate regularly, the immunity period is much shorter, Kerkhove said. This is "early data," and more studies are needed, she said.

Preliminary studies in China, Germany, the UK, and elsewhere have found patients infected with the novel coronavirus make protective antibodies as part of their immune system's defenses, but these appear to last only a few months. That raises big problems for developers of potential COVID-19 vaccines, experts say, and for public health authorities seeking to deploy them to protect populations from future waves of the pandemic.

To be truly effective, COVID-19 vaccines "will either need to generate stronger and longer-lasting protection... or they may need to be given regularly," said Stephen Griffin, a Leeds University associate professor of medicine. "And those things are not trivial."

[Concerns re waning immunity and possible strain differences have significant import for vaccine development. If there are multiple strains of the virus in circulation and only one is covered by the vaccine, the possibility of creating a hyperimmune response to challenge with the antigen is there and may result in severe disease. In terms of waning immunity, the duration of immunity produced by the vaccine may require booster doses at frequent intervals, creating supply challenges as well as logistic challenges to vaccinate the individuals. That being said, in the case of apparent 2nd infections with the coronavirus, genomic studies on the 1st and 2nd virus identified are needed to address issues of possible strain variations. - Mod.MPP]

[The problem of defining persistent detection of viral RNA versus reinfection with SARS-CoV2 is challenging and the question is arising with increasing frequency as earlier cases become more common. Guidance from US CDC:

"Reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been definitively confirmed in any recovered persons to date. If, and if so when, persons can be reinfected with SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown and is a subject of investigation. Persons infected with related endemic human betacoronavirus appear to become susceptible again at around 90 days after onset of infection. Thus, for persons recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, a positive PCR during the 90 days after illness onset more likely represents persistent shedding of viral RNA than reinfection.

If such a person remains asymptomatic during this 90-day period, then any re-testing is unlikely to yield useful information, even if the person had close contact with an infected person.

If such a person becomes symptomatic during this 90-day period and an evaluation fails to identify a diagnosis other than SARS-CoV-2 infection (e.g., influenza), then the person may warrant evaluation for SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in consultation with an infectious disease or infection control expert. Quarantine may be warranted during this evaluation, particularly if symptoms developed after close contact with an infected person."

[2] South Korea: older children transmit virus same as adults
Date: Sat 18 Jul 2020
Source: The New York Times [abridged, edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/18/health/coronavirus-children-schools.html


In the heated debate over reopening schools, one burning question has been whether and how efficiently children can spread the virus to others. A large new study from South Korea offers an answer: Children younger than 10 transmit to others much less often than adults do, but the risk is not zero. And those between the ages of 10 and 19 can spread the virus at least as well as adults do. The findings suggest that as schools reopen, communities will see clusters of infection take root that include children of all ages, several experts cautioned.

"I fear that there has been this sense that kids just won't get infected or don't get infected in the same way as adults and that, therefore, they're almost like a bubbled population," said Michael Osterholm, infectious diseases expert at the University of Minnesota. "There will be transmission," Dr Osterholm said. "What we have to do is accept that now and include that in our plans."

Several studies from Europe and Asia have suggested that young children are less likely to get infected and to spread the virus. But most of those studies were small and flawed, said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute. The new study "is very carefully done, it's systematic and looks at a very large population," Dr. Jha said. "It's one of the best studies we've had to date on this issue."

South Korean researchers identified 5706 people who were the 1st to report Covid-19 symptoms in their households between [20 Jan 2020] and [27 Mar 2020], when schools were closed, and then traced the 59 073 contacts of these "index cases." They tested all of the household contacts of each patient, regardless of symptoms, but only tested symptomatic contacts outside the household. The 1st person in a household to develop symptoms is not necessarily the 1st to have been infected, and the researchers acknowledged this limitation. Children are also less likely than adults to show symptoms, so the study may have underestimated the number of children who set off the chain of transmission within their households.

Children under 10 were roughly half as likely as adults to spread the virus to others, consistent with other studies. That may be because children generally exhale less air -- and therefore less virus-laden air -- or because they exhale that air closer to the ground, making it less likely that adults would breathe it in. Even so, the number of new infections seeded by children may rise when schools reopen, the study authors cautioned. "Young children may show higher attack rates when the school closure ends, contributing to community transmission of COVID-19," they wrote. Other studies have also suggested that the large number of contacts for schoolchildren, who interact with dozens of others for a good part of the day, may cancel out their smaller risk of infecting others.

The researchers traced the contacts only of children who felt ill, so it's still unclear how efficiently asymptomatic children spread the virus, said Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. "I think it was always going to be the case that symptomatic children are infectious," she said. "The questions about the role of children are more around whether children who don't have symptoms are infectious." Dr Rivers was a member of a scientific panel that on Wednesday recommended reopening schools wherever possible for disabled children and for those in elementary schools because those groups have the most trouble learning online. She said the new study does not alter that recommendation.

The study is more worrisome for children in middle and high school. This group was even more likely to infect others than adults were, the study found. But some experts said that finding may be a fluke or may stem from the children's behaviors. These older children are frequently as big as adults, and yet may have some of the same unhygienic habits as young children do. They may also have been more likely than the younger children to socialize with their peers within the high-rise complexes in South Korea. "We can speculate all day about this, but we just don't know," Dr Osterholm said. "The bottom line message is: There's going to be transmission."

Although the new study does not offer definitive answers, he said, it does indicate that schools can increase virus levels within a community. "So long as children are not just a complete dead end -- incapable of passing the virus on, which does not seem to be the case -- putting them together in schools, having them mix with teachers and other students will provide additional opportunities for the virus to move from person to person," he said.

[The study under discussion is: Park YJ, Choe YJ, Park O, et al. Contact Tracing during Coronavirus Disease Outbreak, South Korea, 2020 [published online ahead of print, 2020 Jul 16]. Emerg Infect Dis. 2020; 26(10): 10.3201/eid2610.201315; https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/10/20-1315_article

Abstract
--------
"We analyzed reports for 59 073 contacts of 5706 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) index patients reported in South Korea during [20 Jan 2020-27 Mar 2020]. Of 10 592 household contacts, 11.8% had COVID-19. Of 48 481 non-household contacts, 1.9% had COVID-19. Use of personal protective measures and social distancing reduces the likelihood of transmission."

In the discussion section, the authors mention they found the highest COVID-19 rate (18.6% [95% CI 14.0%-24.0%]) for household contacts of school-aged children and the lowest (5.3% [95% CI 1.3%-13.7%]) for household contacts of children 0-9 years in the middle of school closure. Other studies on contact tracing in Wuhan and Shanghai cited by the authors "showed that school closure and social distancing significantly reduced the rate of COVID-19 among contacts of school-aged children" (Zhang J, Litvinova M, Liang Y, et al. Changes in contact patterns shape the dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Science. 2020; 368:1481-6; https://science.sciencemag.org/content/368/6498/1481). Food for thought for areas considering school opening, especially if there is significant ongoing community spread in an area. - Mod.MPP]

[3] Selected countries
[A] China: National Health Commission, 83 682 total cases, 4634 deaths
[B] South Korea: 13 771 confirmed cases, 296 deaths
[C] Italy: 244 434 total cases, 35 045 deaths
[D] Iran: 273 656 total cases, 14 188 deaths
[E] USA: 3 898 550 total cases, 143 289 deaths

[These countries have been selected based on having had significant surges with SARS-CoV-2 infections, but different responses. In some cases, transmission was almost interrupted, but resurgences have occurred, and countries have handled them differently. One observation is that lifting of restrictions has led to major resurgences in some areas; in others, early new threats seem to be importations, but community spread does recur. Good contact tracing has helped to shorten the time with new clusters, and temporary new restrictions have impacted. Countries not implementing restrictions have done more poorly with major resurgences. - Mod.MPP]

[There were 22 new confirmed cases in the past 24 hours; 5 were imported, and 17 were locally acquired in Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. While it is now 14 days with no new cases reported from Beijing, the cluster is growing in Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, there are now 47 cases identified (I don't have the breakdown for 18 and 19 Jul 2020 numbers of asymptomatic vs symptomatic cases). The 1st case worked in a shopping center in Tianshan district of Urumqi (the capital city).

There were 13 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic individuals (4 imported) and 1 new conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. Since 18 May 2020, China has reported 38 cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic infection.

Hong Kong reported 108 new cases. The official government site in Hong Kong mentions a total of 1886 cases (confirmed) and 1 probable. The newly reported cases announced today (19 Jul 2020) involve 45 males and 63 females aged between 7 and 91 years. Among them, 25 had travel history during the incubation period. (https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202007/19/P2020071900812.htm). Travel history was the Philippines (16), Japan (2), India (2), USA (2), France (1), Pakistan (1), and UAE (1). (https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202007/19/P2020071900812_346107_1_1595173835011.pdf)/

Takeaway message: China continues to have importations of infected individuals with SARS-CoV-2 and has occasional cluster flair-ups (see comments in the section on South Korea below). Hong Kong is dealing with increased local transmission associated with the lifting of restrictions; new severe restrictions have been announced. Cases are primarily locally transmitted although there are importations.

[In the past 24 hours, according to the report at the source URL, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 26 cases with 1 new death, compared with 34 cases and 1 new death in the previous day (18 Jul 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 96 consecutive days. There were 4 locally transmitted cases: Seoul (2), Gwangju (1), and Jeonnam (1); and 22 imported cases: airport quarantine (10), Incheon (2), Daegu (2), South Gyeongsangnam (2), Gyeonggi (1), Seoul (1), Gyeongbuk (1) Jeonnam (1), Chungnam (1), and Jeonbuk (1). 7 provinces reported no newly confirmed cases (compared with 11 provinces yesterday, 18 Jul 2020).

The overall impression hasn't changed. Lifting of measures was accompanied by increases in locally acquired infections through increasing clusters related to gatherings of people at employment (bringing it outside employment to contacts) and in houses of worship, and bars and clubs. Contact tracing and isolation seem to have had an impact. Now importations are playing a major role in the country as well. Looking at both China and South Korea, I suspect that importations may result in the occasional silent spread from asymptomatic infections which may be missed through the testing (false negatives). A superspreading event may result, leading to a recognized cluster, which can ultimately be interrupted until the next cycle occurs. The increase in cases in the past few days has been paralleled by increases in reported deaths.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is up by +219 cases and +3 deaths in the past 24 hours. The previous day's (18 Jul 2020) 24-hour change was +249 cases and +14 deaths. The hospitalized cases and cases in intensive care units are still in a slow decline.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna, the main provinces at the original epicenter of the outbreak (see tables at the link on the source URL to "download the latest data"). The provinces reporting the largest numbers of newly confirmed cases in the 24-hour period are Emilia-Romagna (51) and Veneto (48); Lombardy (33), Liguria (23), Lazio (17), and Tuscany (16) are the provinces reporting 10 or more cases. This is the 1st time another province reported more cases than Lombardy since the major activity in the north began. A total of 15 provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (4 provinces reported no new cases). Italy is now 74 days post phase 2 initial opening up and 58 days post 2nd stage of phase 2 opening up.

[The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 3 898 550 including 143 289 deaths, an increase from 3 833 271 cases and 142 877 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York City had a cumulative total of 218 159 cases as of 13:00 EDT (GMT-4) on 19 Jul 2020 (+264 since 18 Jul 2020) including 18 776 (+5 since 18 Jul 2020) confirmed deaths and an additional 4624 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

The top 10 states in terms of daily reported cases in descending order are Florida, Texas, California, Georgia, Louisiana, South Carolina, Arizona, North Carolina, Alabama, and Tennessee. Note that 6 of the 10 states are located in the south east region of the country. This list includes states that are showing major increases in daily cases reported beginning with the lifting of restrictions around the end of May 2020. All of the top 10 states reported more than 1500 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, with the range being 1742 to 12 478. In terms of cumulative case reports, the order is unchanged from previous days with New York as number one, followed by California, Florida, Texas, New Jersey, Illinois, Arizona, Georgia, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania. A total of 45 states and entities have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.

In the past 24 hours, the proportional increase of newly confirmed cases was 1.7%. The 7-day average of newly confirmed cases for the past 7 days is 12.4% higher than the 7-day average for the preceding 7 days, consistent with the ongoing pandemic in the country, but gradually slowing down, but may reflect a change in reporting in the USA that began on Mon 13 Jul 2020, combined with weekend artifact.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html) has data on cases, hospitalization, testing, and epidemiologic variables such as age, race, ILI (influenza-like illness), surveillance, and emergency room visits, which are definitely worth reviewing, as a welcome series of analyses. According to the CDC data, as of 19 Jul 2020, the percentage of laboratory specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 with a molecular assay remained at 9% out of 47 313 367 tests performed on 18 Jul 2020, consistent with the ongoing, not-yet-under-control pandemic in the country (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html).

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 19 Jul 2020.

Highlights
----------
- COVID-19 affects us all, but most especially vulnerable populations such as refugees and migrants. To assess the public health and social impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on refugees and migrants, WHO and partners are conducting a global study called 'ApartTogether'. You can participate through a survey currently being conducted.

- To combat misconceptions about COVID-19 in Nigeria, WHO and the Nigerian government are scaling up strategies to demystify COVID-19 by working with traditional leaders. The aim is to empower traditional leaders, who command great respect, to participate in on-going sensitization efforts and to sustain the strategy by letting community members lead the campaign.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

A caution in interpreting today's numbers -- there are definitely weekend reporting artifacts. Countries reporting 0 cases in the past 24 hours that presently have had major transmission ongoing include USA, Spain, France, Sweden, Kyrgyzstan, Cameroon, and Cote d'Ivoire.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:

- The Americas region reported 42.2% of the global newly reported cases and 61.8% of newly reported deaths for this 24-hour period, maintaining its dominance as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 7 million cases. As mentioned above, the USA did not report any newly confirmed cases in the region to WHO today (19 Jul 2020), Brazil reported 48.6% (34 177), Colombia 12.7% (8934), Mexico 10.3% (7257), Argentina 6.4% (4518), Peru 5.6% (3951), and Chile 3.3% (2307). Removal of the USA from the tally highlights further the major SARS-CoV-2 transmission ongoing in Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, and Chile.

- The European region reported 10.9% of the global newly reported cases and 6.3% of the newly confirmed deaths globally. Russia reported 33.6% (6109) of the regional newly confirmed cases, followed by Kazakhstan reporting 9.0% (1636), Israel 8.8% (1597), Turkey 5.0% (918), Romania 4.9% (889), the UK 4.5% (827), Ukraine 4.0% (731), Uzbekistan 2.9% (533), Azerbaijan 2.7% (497), and Armenia 2.3% (415).

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 8.2% of the global newly reported cases and 10.9% of global newly reported fatalities. Saudi Arabia reported 18.7% (2565) of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Iran 15.8% (2166), Iraq 14.9% (2049), Pakistan 11.5% (1579), Oman 9.6% (1311), Egypt 5.1% (698), Kuwait 5.0% (683), Bahrain 3.9% (531), and Qatar 3.0% (410).

- The African region reported 10.6% of the global newly reported cases and 4.4% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 75.4% (13 285) of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Kenya 3.9% (688), Nigeria 3.7% (653), Algeria 3.4% (601), Ghana 2.8% (488), Madagascar 2.2% (382), and Ethiopia 2.0% (356).

- The Western Pacific region reported 2.0% of the global newly reported cases and 2.6% of global deaths. The Philippines reported 68.3% (2303) of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Japan 15.1% (510), Australia 6.1% (206), Singapore 6.0% (202), China 2.4% (80), and South Korea 1.0% (34).

- The South East Asia region reported 26.1% of the global newly reported cases and 14.1% of global deaths. India reported 89.5% (38 902) of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 6.2% (2709) and Indonesia 4.0% (1752).

Impression: The overall picture is basically the same, even with the weekend reporting artifact. Just the percentages vary with global representations higher for the Western Pacific, but the relative positions remain the same. The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed cases on a daily basis (even in the absence of reports from the USA today (19 Jul 2020), followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, followed by the Africa region and the Western Pacific representing the lowest daily caseload of all of the regions. The progression has been the initial "surge" in the Western Pacific region, followed by the surge in the European region and its decline, the entry and surging of the Americas region without any decrease, and the gradual and persistent increase in the South East Asia region, the increase then plateauing of the Eastern Mediterranean region, and the slow but steady increase in the Africa region and a slight increase in the Western Pacific region today [19 Jul 2020].

[A caution for interpretation of today's data and a probable weekend reporting artifact. As mentioned in the WHO situation report above, key countries that have usual daily reports had no update data available over the weekend [18-19 Jul 2020] in both the WHO report and in the Worldometer report -- notably Spain, France, Sweden, Cameroon, Denmark, and Norway. (The USA did not report any cases to WHO in the 19 Jul 2020 situation report above in section [4]). Data were available for the USA on the Worldometer website, although with a reduced reporting as some entities did not have data presented over the weekend.

According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of reported cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 14 640 375, with reports of cases by 217 countries and territories worldwide. The global case count rose by 1.5% in the past 24 hours. The USA and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts, although India is rapidly increasing, with daily case counts now over 40 000.

In the past 24 hours, the USA reported the most newly confirmed cases (65 279) followed by India (40 243), and Brazil (24 650). The total cumulative case counts for the top 5 countries (USA, Brazil, India, Russia, South Africa) represent over half of the total cases reported globally (56.4%). A global total of 608 857 deaths have been reported, an increase of 4034 deaths in the past 24 hours.

In descending rank order, the USA is number one for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by India, Brazil, South Africa, Colombia, Russia, Mexico, Argentina, Peru, and Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia displaced Bangladesh on this list. All these countries are currently experiencing major community-based transmission and considered global hot spots. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed cases goes from 2504 to 65 279.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase of 8.6%, but this drop from yesterday's 9.0% may well be a function of weekend reporting artifact.

Impression: The SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts. That being said, the most severely affected region is the Americas, with cases increasing on a daily basis even though the comparative 7-day average suggests things may be slowing down (or reporting is slowing down). - Mod.MPP]
