[Anthrax is sporadic in Hungary and possibly suffers from under-reporting -- thus the zoological garden lion case in 2014. [See: 10 Apr 2014 Anthrax - Hungary: (DE) zoo lion ex bovine 20140410.2395492]. Immediate previous outbreaks have been in 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, & 2012. However this outbreak was noticed and reported when only 2 sheep were affected in a flock of 495. It is not unusual for the number affected to reach 20 before anything is done. The farm shepherd is to be congratulated, seriously. Frankly we need more shepherds like that. In that the OIE report includes antibiotic treatment of "affected" animals for a disease which declares itself with unexpected deaths, it would seem that in-contact sheep suspected of maybe incubating disease were proactively treated with long-acting antibiotics.

Livestock anthrax is basically a summer disease and it is barely spring, but it is the lambing season, with all its concurrent health problems. No source has been reported as yet, but I would not be surprised if it were from a contaminated hay or feed. We must await clarification from our Hungarian colleagues. - Mod.MHJ
