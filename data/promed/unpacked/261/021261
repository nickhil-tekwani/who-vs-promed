A New Hampshire company is recalling a line of dog treats after 3 dozen people became sick. The state public health department says Kritter's Kitchen Kreations of Loudon is voluntarily recalling its Joey's Jerky chicken jerky for pets due to possible salmonellosis risk.

Officials say while it's uncommon for pet food and treats to be contaminated with salmonellae, the outbreak highlights the need for pet owners to wash their hands after handling the items.

The pet treats were sold at: America's Pet in Hudson, Blue Seal in Bow, K9 Kaos in Dover, Osborne's Agway and Sandy's Pet Food Center in Concord, and The Yellow Dogs Barn in Barrington.

Company officials did not immediately return a call.

[The serotype of _Salmonella enteritidis_ in this outbreak is not stated.

The following is a commentary about this topic from 2006 (Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2006; 55: 702-5 (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5525a3.htm):

"In recent years, an increasing variety of animal by-products, such as pig ears, have become available for purchase as animal-derived pet treats. Animal-derived pet treats have been associated with previous outbreaks of human salmonella infection in Canada. In 1999, contaminated pig ear pet treats were confirmed as the source of an outbreak of human _S._ Infantis in several provinces (1,6). In 2002, contaminated pet treats imported from Texas were associated with human _S._ Newport infections in Calgary, Alberta (2). The _S._ Infantis isolates from the patients in Canada and from the pet treats in the USA were indistinguishable by PFGE. Follow-up investigations of those outbreaks indicated that pet treats are frequently contaminated with salmonella organisms. In Canada, after the 1999 outbreak, salmonella organisms were isolated from 48 (51 per cent) of 94 samples of pig ear pet treats purchased from retail stores in Alberta (2). In the USA, salmonella organisms, including _S._Infantis_, were isolated from 65 (41 per cent) of 158 samples of pig ear and other animal-derived pet treats purchased from retail stores during 1999-2000 (7).

Detecting and controlling the transmission of salmonella organisms through pet treats poses several challenges (8). Animal-derived pet treats often are contaminated with salmonellae, and the dehydration procedure used to make pet treats might not be effective at eliminating the organism. Aside from direct contact with contaminated pet treats, transmission of salmonellae to humans might also occur indirectly through infection in pets. Pets consuming contaminated treats might become colonized with salmonellae but remain asymptomatic, thus becoming unrecognized sources of contamination in the household. Young children, older adults, or immunocompromised persons in such households might have a higher risk for severe illness from salmonella infection.
