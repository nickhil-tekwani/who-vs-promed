May I be permitted to add a few words to the debate on diseases of fruit
bats please?
I refer to Lagos bat virus, first isolated from straw-coloured fruit bats
_Eidolon helvum_ in Nigeria in 1956. Since that time, one isolate has been
made from a _Micropterus pusillus_ fruit bat in the Central African
Republic in 1974, three isolates from _Epomophorus wahlbergi_ fruit bats in
South Africa in 1980 (although only one bat was positively identified)
another from an _Eidolon helvum_ in Senegal in 1985 and one other isolate
was made from an _Epomophorus wahlbergi_ in South Africa in 1990. In
addition to these isolations of Lagos bat virus from fruit bats, one
isolate was made from a _Nycteris gambiensis_ (insectivorous bat) in
Senegal in 1985.
In his excellent chapter on rabies in Infectious Diseases of Livestock
(Eds. J. A. W. Coetzer, G. R. Thomson and R. C. Tustin) OUP., Bob Swanepoel
summarizes an epidemic of bat rabies in Natal, when 282 bats were submitted
for laboratory examination from June 1980 to December 1981 and fluorescence
with polyclonal antirabies conjugate was observed in the brains of 13 bats
(ten in 1980, 3 in 1981). The affected individuals are believed to have
been common epauleted fruit bats (_Epomophorus wahlbergi_) although only
one bat was positively identified. The further isolation of Lagos bat virus
from an _E. wahlbergi_ found dead in 1990 suggests that that the virus is
endemic in Natal.
Lagos bat virus is predominantly isolated from frugivorous bats but has
also been isolated from domestic cats in South Africa and Zimbabwe, and a
dog in Ethiopia. However, it is the only one of the currently known six or
seven _Lyssavirus_ genotypes not to have been associated with human death.
