Blood tests on some 22 828 sheep from 144 farms in Dumfries and
Galloway and the Borders in southern Scotland have all been confirmed
negative for foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), the Scottish Executive
announced on 1 Oct 2001.
The 2 counties were the only ones in Scotland to see cases of FMD in
this year's epidemic. The Executive said the tests had been in excess
of statutory EU requirements.
Additionally, restrictions have been lifted on farms in the Borders
that had been considered at risk of FMD because they had had contact
recently with a farmer from Hexham, one of the continuing centers of
the disease in England.
Scottish farm minister Ross Finnie said these developments would
reinforce his case in Brussels for restarting sheep-meat exports from
the whole of Scotland. The test results will also mean sheep will now
be allowed to be moved under licence out of Dumfries and Galloway and
the Borders. The 2 counties were allowed to begin holding cattle
markets again from 1 Oct 2001.
