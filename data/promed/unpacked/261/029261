Cameroon's Ministry of Public Health has confirmed the spread of a cholera epidemic in the South-West and Littoral regions, after registering 37 positive cases and 5 deaths. According to a report published Tue 1 Feb [2022] by the Ministry of Public Health, 3 cholera deaths were recorded among the 25 cases tested positive at the district hospital of Buea, capital of the South-West region.

In the Littoral region, specifically in the department of Moungo, it is the health district of Melong that is affected. The health authorities have confirmed 2 deaths, and 12 cases tested positive in this region where the semi-finals of CAN 2021 (African Cup of Nations, football competition) are played.

Doctor Gilbert Eko, regional public health delegate for the South-West, during a crisis meeting on Tuesday [2 Feb 2022], called on the populations to be careful and to respect hygiene rules. "People are invited to systematically wash their hands with running water and soap, use the toilets, wash raw foods before consuming them, and consume only drinking water," he said.

Cholera occurs frequently in Cameroon. Last November [2021], it killed 13 people in Yaounde and Ekondo-Titi, a coastal town northwest of Douala. Illness results from drinking contaminated water or food.

[2] Cholera - South Sudan vaccination program

The Ministry of Health, with support from the WHO, IOM, UNICEF, and other partners, conducted a pre-emptive oral cholera vaccination campaign in the high-risk, flood-affected locations; the 1st round started on 25 Jan 2022 in Rubkona and Bentiu Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) Camp in Unity State targeting over 202 000 people.

The 2nd round of the campaign is slated to take place in mid-February 2022, and similar vaccination campaigns will be conducted in the other prioritized flood-affected and cholera-hotspot counties in Unity, Jonglei, Upper Nile, Central Equatoria, Eastern Equatoria, Lakes, and Warrap states.

Rubkona County is one of the counties affected by unprecedented floods in 2021. The floods have caused massive displacement with thousands of affected populations from across the state now living in IDP camps.

"To protect communities, prevent transmission, and control outbreaks, all aspects of the national cholera prevention and control plan must be maintained and accelerated so as not to lose momentum, and to consolidate the interventions and gains over the past years," said Dr John Rumunu, director-general, Preventive Health Services, Ministry of Health, South Sudan. "This requires multisectoral action that prioritizes coordination, rapid response to prevent widespread outbreaks, and long-term interventions to prevent cholera transmission in hotspot areas."

During the flag-off of the vaccination campaign at Rubkona PHCC, the acting director-general, State Ministry of Health, Unity State, Mr Elijah Makuei, said, "The situation is worrying. Given the current congestion in the displacement sites and the inadequate access to safe water, sanitation, and hygiene, both in the IDP camps and in towns, chances of disease outbreaks, including cholera, are very high."

Dr Fabian Ndenzako, WHO representative for South Sudan, said, "Given the humanitarian crises in South Sudan and the several outbreaks of cholera the country faced in the past, the pre‚Äêemptive mass oral cholera vaccination campaigns provide protection to the vulnerable population and are used as a bridge for launching sustainable and long-term interventions."

With support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, a total 2.9 million oral cholera vaccines have been secured to prevent the risk of outbreaks in cholera hotspot areas of the country. For the vaccine to be most effective people need 2 doses administered 2-4 weeks apart.

Since the last half of 2021, widespread flooding has affected 835 000 people in 33 counties across the country as of the end of December 2021. The hard-hit areas include locations in Unity, Jonglei, and Upper Nile.

Cholera continues to be a public health threat to children, women, and other vulnerable groups in South Sudan. The recurrent outbreaks of cholera since 2014, including the longest and largest (18 Jun 2016 to 18 Dec 2017), demonstrate the continued vulnerability of the population to the disease, which is preventable and treatable.

[Aggressive interventions to stem outbreaks of cholera include providing sources of clean water and a vaccination campaign.

The following is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P. Cholera. In Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J, eds. New York: Nova Bioscience; 2017, pp. 113-136.

"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons, vaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside of Viet Nam. Given as 2- or 3-dose courses, efficacy can be as high as 60-80% for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection lengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness, especially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until reports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility.

"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:
- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1 with recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some protection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;
- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and O139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata, India, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of this product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years was 65% (95% CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A locally produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced in Viet Nam;
- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains both O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been reported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61).

"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine for use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine, Vaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a reformulation of a previous product. This product, a single-dose immunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the frozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given until at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be given at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial prophylaxis. Single-dose use is an advantage over the older inactivated products, which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however, have suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be effective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and outbreak situations (63,64)."
