[According to the report above, in the past 24 hours, there have been 21 newly confirmed cases in China, 4 of which were imported and 17 acquired locally (all in Beijing municipality). No new deaths were reported. Three new cases were reported in Hong Kong. A total of 1899 imported cases have been reported. There have been no new deaths reported for several weeks, which may change with the significant increase in newly reported cases.

The 1st case in Beijing was reported on 11 Jun 2020; as of 26 Jun 2020, there have been 297 cases reported from Beijing, 21 in Hebei and 3 in Liaoning most likely associated with this outbreak.

The cases reported in Hong Kong all had a history of travel during their incubation periods and involve 3 males between the ages of 7 and 26 years (https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/06/20200626/20200626_172310_387.html).

There were 12 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic individuals in the past 24 hours.

There was one case of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. Since 18 May 2020, there have been 22 cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic infections reported by China. More in-depth follow-up information on the ongoing outbreak in Beijing can be found in section [1] of COVID-19 update (262): China (Beijing) superspreaders, WHO, global 20200616.7473860.

[In the past 24 hours, according to the report at the source URL, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 51 cases with no new deaths, compared with 39 cases and no new deaths in the previous day (25 Jun 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 77 consecutive days. There were 31 locally transmitted cases -- Seoul (15), Gyeonggi (12), Daejeon (2), Daegu (1), and Jeonbuk (1), and 20 imported cases -- airport quarantine (11), Gyeonggi (5), Seoul (2), Incheon (1), and Chungbuk (1). There were 10 provinces reporting no newly confirmed cases.

According to data from the "ncov" website of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the cumulative positive testing rate has been 1.0% (http://ncov.mohw.go.kr/) steady for the past 48 hours.

The overall impression hasn't changed: Lifting of measures has been accompanied by increases in locally acquired infections through increasing clusters related to gatherings of people at employment (bringing it outside employment to contacts) and in houses of worship, and bars and clubs.

Tabular and graphic analyses of the situation in South Korea with the addition of the 51 newly confirmed cases are available at the English language page, notice 399: https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030. Presumably, description of the clusters will be available at the same URL, notice 400, when it is posted.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 239 961 cases, including 34 708 deaths, up by +255 cases and +30 deaths in the past 24 hours. The previous day's (25 Jun 2020) 24-hour change was +190 cases and +34 deaths. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are still in decline. As it has been, the major increase in cases was in Lombardy, reporting 156 newly confirmed cases, down from 170 the previous day.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in Lombardy, the original epicenter of the outbreak (see tables at the link on the source URL to "download the latest data"). Lombardy again reported the largest number of newly confirmed cases in the 24-hour period (156). Emilia-Romagna (42), Piedmont (15), and Lazio (13) are the 3 provinces reporting more than 10 newly confirmed cases but fewer than 50. A total of 17 provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (5 provinces reported no new cases).

Italy is now 52 days post phase 2 initial opening up and 36 days post 2nd stage of phase 2 opening up. Northern Italy still warrants close monitoring.

[4] Iran: 217 724 total cases, 10 239 deaths
Date: Fri 26 Jun 2020
Source: Radio Farda [edited]
https://en.radiofarda.com/a/iran-health-official-says-up-to-20-percent-in-tehran-contracted-coronavirus/30692707.html


Alireza Zali, Chief of Coronavirus Combat Headquarters of Tehran, has said Friday [26 Jun 2020] studies show that between 14% and 20% of the residents of the Iranian capital have already contracted the coronavirus. Speaking on a live news program, Zali said the highest numbers of cases and fatalities were found in District 4 of Tehran, which is the most densely populated with 900 000 residents in the east of the capital. Districts 21 and 22 in the west of the capital have had the lowest number of cases and deaths, he said. Tehran has a population of nearly 8.7 million but up to 3.5 million people commute to the city at daytime from its suburbs and nearby cities.

If 15% of people in Tehran are infected as the Coronavirus Combat Headquarters Chief says, that alone would mean more than one million cases, which greatly contradicts the officially announced total of 217 000 cases for the whole country. Iran's official COVID-19 figures have been repeatedly questioned by some members of the parliament and other officials. They have asserted that the real coronavirus-related death toll in Iran is much higher than what the health ministry releases as official figures. [Is there any country with populations greater than 5 to 10 million individuals with a truly accurate report of numbers of cases and deaths attributable to infection with the SARS-CoV-2?]

According to the latest official announcement on [26 Jun 2020], new cases in the past 24 hours amounted to 2626, with 109 new deaths. This brings the total number of cases and deaths in the country to 217 724 and 10 239, respectively.

Several provinces in the west and south of the country, according to the Health Ministry spokesperson Sima-Sadat Lari on Friday [26 Jun 2020], are currently in critical circumstances.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 2 552 956, including 127 640 deaths, an increase from 2 504 588 cases and 126 780 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York City had a cumulative total of 210 908 cases as of 13:00 EDT (GMT-4) on 26 Jun 2020, including 17 753 confirmed deaths and an additional 4668 probable deaths, representing an increase of 385 newly confirmed cases and 38 deaths in the past 24 hours (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

The top 10 states in terms of daily reported cases in descending order are Florida, California, Texas, Arizona, Illinois, Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, South Carolina, and Louisiana. This list includes states that are showing major increases in daily cases reported beginning with the lifting of restrictions around the end of May 2020. All 10 states each reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours with the range being 1310 to 8942. One more state had more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours -- Ohio, with 1002 newly confirmed cases.

In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by California, New Jersey, Texas (surpassed Illinois in the past 24 hours), Illinois, Florida, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Michigan. Arizona is poised to surpass Michigan in the next 24-48 hours. A total of 41 states and entities have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.

In the past 24 hours the proportion of newly confirmed cases was 1.9%. Of note is the 7-day average of newly confirmed cases for the past 7 days is 27.9% higher than the 7-day average for the preceding 7 days.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html) has data on cases, hospitalization, testing, and epidemiologic variables such as age, race, ILI (influenza-like illness), surveillance, and emergency room visits, definitely worth reviewing, a welcome series of analyses. According to the CDC data, as of today (26 Jun 2020) the percent positive testing results nationally is 9%, the same as yesterday (25 Jun 2020), consistent with the ongoing, as yet not under control pandemic in the country.
