[In response to the request by ProMED for update of vaccine
information (see post 20060214.0491), Dr. Edelman has provided the
following abstract and background to their paper]:

J. Phase II safety and immunogenicity study of live chikungunya virus
vaccine TSI-GSD-218. June 2000; Am J Trop Med Hyg, 62:681-5
ABSTRACT
We conducted a phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, safety
and immunogenicity study of a serially passaged, plaque-purified live
chikungunya (CHIK) vaccine in 73 healthy adult volunteers. 59 volunteers were
immunized one time subcutaneously with the CHIK vaccine, and 14 were immunized
with placebo (tissue culture fluid). Vaccinees were clinically evaluated
intensively for one month and had repeated blood draws for serological assays
(50 percent plaque-reduction neutralization test) for one year. Except for
transient arthralgia in 5 CHIK vaccinees, the number and severity of local and
systemic reactions and abnormal laboratory tests after immunization were
similar in CHIK vaccinees and placebo recipients. 57 (98 percent) of 58
evaluable CHIK vaccinees developed CHIK neutralizing antibody by day 28, and
85 percent of vaccinees remained seropositive at one year after immunization.
No placebo recipients seroconverted. This promising live vaccine was safe,
produced well-tolerated side effects, and was highly immunogenic.
BACKGROUND
Chikungunya virus (CHIK) is an alphavirus borne by _Aedes_ mosquitoes
that produces a dengue-like illness in humans, characterized by
fever, rash, painful arthralgia, and sometimes arthritis [1-5]. The
virus is widely disseminated throughout sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast
Asia, India, and the Western Pacific, and numerous epidemics have
been reported in these areas [6-11]. The widespread geographic
distribution, recurrent epidemics, and infection of military
personnel, travelers, and laboratory staff working with CHIK have
indicated the need for a safe and efficacious vaccine [12-15].
Individual strains of CHIK are closely related antigenically [9, 16,
17], and infection with one CHIK strain leads to protection against
all strains [18]. Reciprocal cross-protection after infection with
other alphaviruses occurs in animal models [19, 20], although it is
unclear whether similar cross protection occurs in humans
sequentially exposed to natural infection or live alphavirus vaccines
[21].
An isolate from a patient in Thailand, CHIK strain 15561, was used to
develop a small lot of vaccine 1st passaged in green monkey kidney
(GMK) cells and then formalin-inactivated before administration to 16
volunteers [22]. The vaccine produced no untoward reactions and was
highly immunogenic. The current live vaccine (lot 1-85, TSI-GSD-218)
was developed at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of
Infectious Diseases and was produced at the Salk Institute,
Swiftwater, PA from a lot of the GMK-passaged, strain 15561
inactivated vaccine by subsequent serial passage in MRC-5 cells [23].
The live vaccine proved to be safe and immunogenic in a phase I trial
in 15 alphavirus-naive volunteers [21]. The current phase II,
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was designed to
provide additional safety and immunogenicity data for live CHIK
vaccine TSI-GSD-218.

The vaccine is managed under IND [Investigative New Drug protocol] by the

trial. I have put the French Health Authorities in contact with the U.S. Army.
