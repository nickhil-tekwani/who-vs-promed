The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) is asking for the public's help in tracking the spread of disease that's deforming elk hooves and closely resembles a contagious bacterium that makes sheep and cattle lame.

The department says that over the past decade it has received a growing number of reports of elk hobbled by misshapen hooves in Southwest Washington.

Most of the cases have been concentrated in Cowlitz County but have been reported in 10 counties affecting elk in the St Helens and Willapa herds.

The disease is apparently spread as infected elk leave behind the bacteria in wet soil for other elk to step in, according to scientists.

In the past year [2013], tests have pointed to infectious treponema bacteria, which are linked to digital dermatitis in sheep and cattle, according to WDFW. Digital dermatitis affects livestock throughout the United States, but had never been detected in elk before.

To contain the disease, the WDFW has instructed hunters in Cowlitz, Wahkiakum, Skamania, Clark, Grays Harbor, Thurston, Pierce, Pacific, Lewis, and Klickitat counties to remove the hooves of elk they kill. Hunters should leave behind the hooves, even if the hooves aren't deformed.

The disease does not taint the meat, according to WDFW.

[Reports of lameness and deformed hooves in free-ranging Roosevelt elk (_Cervus elaphus roosevelti_) have occurred sporadically in southwest Washington for over a decade; however, the apparent number and geographical distribution of these reports increased dramatically in 2008 [see ProMED-mail post 20130305.1572490].

In cattle, sheep, and goats, foot rot is a disease with multifactorial causes, with an essential spirochetal bacterial component. The spirochetes involved belong to a diverse phylogenetic group of _Treponema_ sp.

Post-mortem examinations and diagnostic tests conducted in diseased animals have failed to identify a primary cause of hoof deformity in this chronically affected elk population. The levels of copper and selenium found in these animals were low compared to those of livestock (copper deficiency in cattle is associated with increased incidence of infectious hoof disease), but it is unknown whether these levels are low for free-ranging elk.

According to a recent paper by Han and Masfield (J Wldlf Dis 50: 259-79, April 2014) no hoof disease has been reported in domestic livestock by local veterinarians and landowners.
