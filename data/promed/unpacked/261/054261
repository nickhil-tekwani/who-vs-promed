Summary, week 3/2014 [13-19 Jan 2014]
-------------------------------------
The influenza season has begun in some countries in the WHO European Region. Growing numbers of countries in the Region reported increasing consultation rates for influenza-like illness (ILI) and/or acute respiratory infection (ARI). The percentage of influenza-positive sentinel samples has gradually increased over recent weeks, along with the number of specimens tested for influenza. The number of reported hospitalised laboratory-confirmed and fatal influenza cases increased over the last several weeks in western European countries. This week Spain and France reported 33 fatal cases, 19 (58 percent) of them infected with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus.

Virological surveillance for influenza
--------------------------------------
During week 3/2014 [13-19 Jan 2014] the numbers of specimens tested and influenza detections in the Region continued to increase from those in recent weeks. In total, 10 447 specimens from sentinel and non-sentinel sources were tested for influenza, 1628 (16 percent) of which were positive: 1573 (97 percent) influenza A and 55 (3 percent) influenza B. Influenza A has remained dominant since week 40/2013 [30 Sep-6 Oct 2013].

Of the 978 influenza A viruses that were subtyped during week 03/2014, 608 (62 percent) were A(H1N1)pdm09 and 370 (38 percent) A(H3N2), showing a higher proportion of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses than in previous weeks.

Since the beginning of weekly monitoring (week 40/2013), sentinel and non-sentinel sources have yielded 5972 influenza detections, with an increasing proportion of influenza A viruses detected: 5571 (93 percent) were influenza A and 401 (7 percent) influenza B viruses. Of the 3899 influenza A viruses that have been subtyped, 2110 (54 percent) were A(H1N1)pdm09 and 1789 (46 percent) were A(H3N2).

In addition, since week 40/2013 [30 Sep-6 Oct 2013], the lineage of 46 influenza B viruses has been determined: 42 (91 percent) belonged to the B/Yamagata lineage and 4 (9 percent) to B/Victoria.

With an increase in the number of influenza detections, more countries reported data on dominant viruses during week 3/2014 [13-19 Jan 2014] than in previous weeks. All countries (N=17) reported influenza A as the dominant type (Map 1 and country table [available at the source URL above]). In countries providing data on dominant subtypes, influenza A(H3N2) was reported as dominant in Slovenia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Turkey, while Bulgaria, Greece, Portugal, Sweden, Spain and the United Kingdom (Scotland) reported A(H1N1)pdm09 as dominant. The Russian Federation and Switzerland reported A (H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) as co-dominant.

Virus strain characterizations
-------------------------
Circulating influenza viruses are assessed each season for their antigenic and genetic characteristics, to determine the extent of their antigenic similarity to the viruses included in the seasonal influenza vaccine, and determine the prevalence of mutations that affect pathogenicity or are associated with susceptibility to antiviral drugs.

For the 2013/2014 northern hemisphere influenza season, WHO recommended inclusion of A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm09-like, A/Texas/50/2012 (H3N2)-like (an egg-adapted virus antigenically like the cell-propagated prototype virus A/Victoria/361/2011) and B/Massachusetts/2/2012-like (Yamagata lineage) viruses in vaccines (see the WHO headquarters web site).

Since week 40/2013 [30 Sep-6 Oct 2013], 93 influenza viruses characterized antigenically by 9 countries (Denmark, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Norway, Portugal, Romania, the Russian Federation, and the United Kingdom (England)) corresponded with the viruses recommended by WHO for inclusion in the current northern hemisphere seasonal influenza vaccine. 8 countries (Belgium, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, and Sweden) have characterized 173 influenza viruses genetically.

Monitoring of susceptibility to antiviral drugs
-----------------------------------------------
Since week 40/2013 [30 Sep-6 Oct 2013], 6 countries (the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom (England)) have screened 126 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 56 influenza A(H3N2) and 13 influenza B viruses for susceptibility to oseltamivir and zanamivir. All showed susceptibility to both drugs. The 57 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 47 influenza A(H3N2) viruses screened for susceptibility to adamantanes were found to be resistant.

Outpatient surveillance for influenza-like illness (ILI) and/or acute respiratory infection (ARI)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
During week 3/2014 [13-19 Jan 2014], most European countries continued to report low-intensity influenza activity (Map 2 [available at the source URL above]), although the majority reported increasing trends (Map 4 [available at the source URL above]). Regarding geographic spread, influenza activity was predominantly sporadic (Map 3 [available at the source URL above]), with only Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom (England) reporting widespread activity.

During week 3/2014 [13-19 Jan 2014], consultation rates for ILI and/or ARI continued to increase, but remained below the national thresholds or at low levels in all countries reporting clinical data, except for Albania and Israel.

During week 03/2014, 568 sentinel samples tested positive for influenza, with the majority being reported by Spain and Turkey.

Hospital surveillance for SARI
------------------------------
The number of SARI hospitalizations has started to increase in reporting countries participating in hospital surveillance for SARI in the WHO European Region. (Fig. 7 [available at the source URL above]). The majority of cases are in the group aged 0-4 years.

During week 3/2014 [13-19 Jan 2014], 3 (2 percent) of the 129 SARI samples collected in Albania, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Republic of Moldova, Romania, the Russian Federation, Serbia, Slovakia, and Ukraine tested positive for influenza A, with 2 being A(H3N2) (Fig 8a [available at the source URL above]). Click here for a detailed overview in table format. Since week 40/2013 [30 Sep-6 Oct 2013], France, Ireland, Romania, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom have reported 759 hospitalized laboratory-confirmed influenza cases in total: 14 influenza B, 388 A(H1N1)pdm09, 96 A(H3N2), and 261 type A not subtyped.

During week 3/2014 [13-19 Jan 2014], France and Spain reported 33 fatal cases, 19 (58 percent) of these being infected with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
---------------------------------
Based on the data presented by countries reporting on RSV, the positivity rate has been gradually increasing since week 40/2013 [30 Sep-6 Oct 2013] and picked up in week 50/2013 [9-15 Dec 2013] giving a slightly later start compared to the previous season.

In summary for week 3/2014 [13-19 Jan 2014]: of 29 reporting countries, 4 (Bulgaria, Greece, Portugal, and Spain) reported medium-intensity influenza and Portugal, Spain, and the UK (England) reported geographically widespread activity. Of 1401 sentinel specimens tested across 27 countries, 447 (32 percent) were positive for influenza virus. Dominant viruses were reported by Bulgaria, Greece, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, the UK (Scotland) (A(H1N1)pdm09), and Slovenia (A(H3N2)).
