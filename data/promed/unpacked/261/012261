Massive dog vaccination, info campaign urged to eradicate rabies in Aklan
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
With the deaths of 2 Aklanons [from Aklan province, Western Visayas region] due to rabies just this February [2014], the Provincial Health Office (PHO), Office of the Provincial Veterinarian and other member-agencies of the Provincial Rabies Control Committee (PRCC) are one in calling for a massive year-round vaccination of dogs in the province. The PRCC members, in a recent meeting, also agreed that year-round information campaigns to be conducted in schools in the province are essential to raise awareness on the importance of dog vaccination against rabies and on the necessity too of seeking medical attention as soon as possible once a person gets bitten by a dog or any other animal that could be carrying the rabies virus.

The 2 who died from rabies -- one from Kalibo and one from Madalag -- were said to have been brought only for treatment to the hospital when they were already manifesting signs and symptoms of rabies infection, which are aerophobia or fear of drafts of air and hydrophobia or fear of water. [At this clinical point, death is essentially certain. - Mod.MHJ]

The victim from Madalag also preferred to undergo a "tandok" than to seek immediate medical attention. According to older folks, "tandok" is a process of extracting the rabies virus from an animal bite victim with the use of a deer's horn.

The information and education campaign (IEC) in schools to be conducted this year [2014], which was pushed by Department of Education-Aklan Schools Division Planning Officer Edna Ayon, is hoped to help in eradicating this belief and practice in the barangays. "After the information campaign, school children can then tell their parents to have their pets vaccinated after hearing lectures or seeing videos during the activity," Ayon said. Parents could also be invited to attend the information campaign, according to Ayon.

On the other hand, Ben Prado of the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) said the information campaign, as well as dog vaccination could also be held to coincide with barangay assemblies spearheaded by the DILG and conducted in barangays twice a year.

In the 2013 Rabies Program Annual Report, Dr. Cornelio Cuachon, Provincial Health Officer I, reported that in 2013, there were 3608 reported animal bites, while only 2821 of these cases sought post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) from animal bite centers in the province. Dr. Cuachon disclosed that in 2012 and 2013, there were no reported [human] rabies deaths in Aklan.

While Boracay Island had been already declared rabies-free in September 2013, Aklan province aims to be rabies-free by 2020.

[In the 2011 posting (archive no. 20110926.2920) it was stated: "The technical working group (TWG) on rabies prevention and control in Western Visayas is led by the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Health with members coming from the Department of the Interior and Local Government, Department of Education, Philippine National Police, Philippine Information Agency, and the private organizations, among others.

"The TWG as one of its activities on the campaign against rabies, has conducted an orientation on rabies prevention program for teachers in Western Visayas. The activity was attended by school superintendents, principals, and school heads from the various schools' divisions in the region. Dr Jimenez said that the activity hopes to integrate the rabies module in the elementary school curriculum so that the children will be engaged in the war against rabies, and would contribute significantly to the program's sustainability. 'There will still be a lot of fine tuning before we achieve getting the anti-rabies program into the schools' curriculum, but we hope that sooner the concerned sector will address this issue so that the pupils who are always the victims will have a year-round reminder about the threats posed by rabies to human health,' Jimenez said and added that 'continuous education on methods for preventing rabies will play a more important role in eradicating the disease because it involves communities at all age levels, and the teachers really are in constant contact with the children in elementary schools to teach them about rabies.'"

The above is similar to what they are deciding to actually do now in 2014, and why they are optimistic in achieving eradication for Aklan by 2020. During my time with PAHO in the mid-1970s they planned on any successful Brazilian urban rabies eradication program taking only 3 years, not 6, and the Brazilian programs were very effective. Some may wonder why the education program should come into the home via school children. There is precedence for this. I have an Argentine coloured comic book educating rural families on foot-and-mouth vaccination of the family cattle. It worked. And the only way to stop human rabies is by vaccinating dogs, both the family dogs and working dogs, and shooting strays. Wildlife-based rabies is another matter.

Western Visayas, one of the regions of the Philippines, is designated as Region VI. It consists of 6 provinces -- Aklan, Antique, Negros Occidental, Capiz, Guimaras, and Iloilo -- and 16 cities, making it the region with the highest number of cities. Iloilo City is the regional center. The location and provinces of Western Visayas can be seen on the map at http://mapsof.net/uploads/static-maps/philippines_regions_and_provinces.png.
