Anyone who traveled through Terminal 2 at Narita International Airport in Tokyo on 22, 24, and 26 Apr 2019 and is not vaccinated against measles should get to their primary care provider or local immunization clinic, according to a Facebook post by US Forces Japan.

An airport employee may have exposed travelers to the disease on those days, the message said. American Forces Network Pacific is running a similar public service announcement.

"Active-duty troops are supposed to be inoculated; we're at 99.9 percent in Japan," he said. "Dependents should be inoculated, but they're not held to the active-duty standard. "

Globally, between 2016 and 2017, the number of reported measles cases increased by 31%, while in the WHO Western Pacific region (WPR), the total number of cases reported decreased by 82% during the same period. However, there was an increase in cases reported in WPR, from 11 118 in 2017 to 26 163 cases in 2018. A resurgence of measles cases has been seen in all WHO regions. An unusually high number of cases reported from countries and areas of the WPR in 2019 have been reported from: 1) several countries/areas where measles has been eliminated due to importation-related outbreaks; and 2) endemic countries such as the Philippines which has ongoing measles outbreak. In WPR, currently 9 countries and areas (Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Hong Kong SAR (China), Japan, Macao SAR (China), New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, and Singapore) are verified by the Regional Verification Commission for Measles Elimination as having interrupted endemic measles virus transmission for more than 36 months.

To date, there have been no measles cases reported from the Pacific island countries and areas. The majority of countries and areas in WPR have made positive inroads to improve immunization and achieve higher vaccination coverage at the national level. However, with global resurgence of measles and movement of populations, several countries and areas in WPR remain vulnerable to outbreaks of measles due to low coverage of measles-containing-vaccine (MCV), at the subnational level and among vulnerable populations.

To date, 23 states have reported cases, but the vast majority have been in New York -- mainly in New York City and in nearby Rockland County

Five dozen more measles cases have been reported across the nation, an 8 percent increase over the prior week as the case total in the US' worst outbreak in decades edges closer to a stunning 800, officials said [Mon 6 May 2019].

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 764 cases had been reported as of last [Thu 2 May 2019]. It's the most in the US since 1994, when 963 were reported, and has been fueled by outbreaks in New York.

Another 41 new cases were reported in New York City, which now has more than 420 patients, and 11 new cases in New York's Rockland county, which took the dramatic step a few weeks ago of banning unvaccinated minors from indoor public places in an effort to control the spread. As of 3 May 2019, Rockland county had 214 confirmed measles cases connected to the current outbreak.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is investigating a potential case of the measles after a child was suspected of having the illness at Detroit Metro Airport [Sat 4 May 2019].

The airport released a statement that said, "Around 9 p.m. [Sat 4 May 2019], an aircraft carrying passengers from Las Vegas landed at Detroit Metropolitan Airport. A young child suspected of having the measles was on board. The CDC responded. The child and family were transported to the hospital. The child is being evaluated."

As of 17 Apr 2019, there were 43 measles cases in Michigan. This is the highest number of cases in the state since 1991, when 65 were reported. Nationwide, the measles outbreak has increased to 704 cases in 22 states, the CDC reported.

When measles arrives: breaking down the anatomy of containment
--------------------------------------------------------------
The arrival of mother and child [with measles to Lowell Community Health Center in Massachusetts] set off a chain of events and triggered longstanding but rarely tested protocols aimed at containing a measles outbreak. It involved hundreds of staff not just at the Lowell Community Health Center, but also the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH), the City of Lowell Health Department, and the local hospital -- with thousands of emails and a weeklong flurry of activity that strained the center's capacities to the limit. They would need to figure out exactly who had been in the lobby, in the pharmacy, and in the pediatrics department during the crucial time window when the child with measles was in the facility. They would have to get back in touch with the nearly 550 people who may have been exposed as they moved through the center's spaces and locate enough vaccine supplies to immunize anyone who needed it, all within 72 hours of the initial exposure.

That the center managed to contain the highly-contagious measles virus is a testament to its modernized records system, its staff's military-style precision, and its location in a resource-rich region. But even here there were occasional missteps, bouts of confusion, and administrative second-guessing and finger-pointing. There were also 179 exposed people with no evidence of vaccination -- even though the center tried to reach them -- suggesting that the fallout at a less-prepared facility could be disastrous.

The city department, meanwhile, has exactly 2 public health nurses available to help with emergencies, says Kerran Vigroux [director of health and human services for the City of Lowell Health Department]. "There are emergency plans that talk about mass vaccinations, but there's no staff to implement them," she says. "We receive enough funding to pay for 2 cell phones for my public health nurses every year. That's it."

Indeed, many community centers are not as organized or well-managed as the Lowell center, and few can afford to compete with salaries offered at hospitals and private practices. If Lowell's staff had not gone "above and beyond" as Steve Fleming, [an epidemiologist with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health] says, the situation could quickly have flared out of control.

But what would have happened had a child with measles shown up at a day care center, say, or a library? These are fair questions, Vigroux suggests -- and with outbreaks now simmering in New York and Connecticut, she says, Massachusetts faces further tests. Indeed, on 1 Apr 2019, state officials announced that a person with measles had visited several locations over the preceding week, and they encouraged anyone drifting through the same establishments during the critical window to contact their doctors.

"If this happened in a school and not a health center -- who's responding, and how is it being managed?" Vigroux asked. "I think our community is not ready for that."

In the 1st 2 months of 2019, 34 300 measles cases have been reported in 42 countries of the WHO European region, including 13 measles-related deaths in 3 countries (Albania, Romania, and Ukraine). The majority of cases are reported in Ukraine, with more than 25 000 cases (more than 70%).

As of 28 Mar 2019, the WHO European region reported a total of 83 540 measles cases and 74 related deaths for 2018. This is compared to 25 869 cases and 42 deaths in 2017, and 5 273 cases and 13 deaths in 2016. In 2018, 8 countries reported over 2 000 cases each including Ukraine (n= 53 218), Serbia (n=5 076), Israel (3 140), France (n=2 913), Italy, (n=2 686), Russian Federation (n=2 256), Georgia (n=2 203), and Greece (n=2 193).

Although the European region achieved its highest ever estimated coverage for the 2nd dose of measles vaccination in 2017 (90%), countries with measles outbreaks have experienced a range of challenges in recent years including a decline or stagnation in overall routine immunization coverage in some cases, low coverage at subnational level or among some marginalized groups and immunity gaps in older populations. Most cases are occurring in unvaccinated or under-vaccinated individuals.

[9] UK: Health Secretary Matt Hancock 'won't rule out' compulsory vaccinations
Date: Sat 4 May 2019 10:52 BST
Source: The Guardian [edited]
https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/04/matt-hancock-wont-rule-out-compulsory-vaccinations


The health secretary [Matt Hancock] has said he would not rule out the option of compulsory vaccinations and said campaigners against jabs for diseases such as measles have "blood on their hands".

Matt Hancock told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "I do think we need to consider all options. Failure to vaccinate when there isn't a good reason is wrong. Those people who campaign against vaccination are campaigning against science. The science is settled."

Unicef released figures last week [week of 22 Apr 2019] showing that more than half a million children in the UK went unvaccinated against measles between 2010 and 2017. Anti-vaccine messages on social media have been blamed for promoting scepticism among parents.

Hancock said: "I don't want to have to reach the point of compulsory vaccination, but I will rule nothing out. I don't want to reach that point and I don't think we are near there, but there is a huge programme of work to increase the proportion of children that are vaccinated.

"If you don't vaccinate your children it is not only your child that is at risk, it is also other children, including children who for medical reasons can't be vaccinated. Vaccination is good for you, good for your child, good for your neighbour and your community."

Earlier, Hancock told the Times: "Those who have promoted the anti-vaccination myth are morally reprehensible, deeply irresponsible and have blood on their hands."

This week [week of 28 Apr 2019] a Labour MP [member of parliament] said the government should look at making failure to immunise children a criminal offence. During a debate in the Commons to mark world immunisation week, Paul Sweeney said the "creeping cynicism" over vaccinations was a "critical national emergency".

A 2nd case of measles was discovered at the Hillel Hemed Nisui Experimental School in Armon HaNatziv in Jerusalem on [Fri 3 May 2019]. One 3rd grader and one 1st grader were reported to have caught the disease.

For months there has been a measles outbreak in Israel.

More than 2 million Israelis are either unvaccinated or only partially vaccinated for the measles, according to a Channel 13 report in April [2019].

The Health Ministry claims that it has only 115 000 doses of measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine available and 100 000 additional doses of the MMRV vaccine, which combines the diminished measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (chickenpox) vaccine, according to the report.

[11] Travel and family disruptions

The US measles outbreak is disrupting families and travel. With the largest number of cases reported in a single year since 1994, and 13 individual outbreaks in 22 states so far this year [2019], families who have children under 1 year old (the minimum age most doctors require for administering the measles vaccination) are left second-guessing travel plans and experiencing turmoil about leaving their homes.

Some pediatricians will make an exception for the 1-year rule during outbreaks such as this, or for babies who will be traveling abroad. The CDC advises that parents consider vaccinating their babies early in these situations.

A family has had to change their lives because of a group of people they've never met. The family lives in an ultra-Orthodox Jewish community in Rockland county, New York, where a measles outbreak continues to grow, health officials say, because many parents refuse to vaccinate their children.

They would love to vaccinate their daughter, but at 2 months old, she's too young. So for another 4 months, until she is old enough to get the vaccine, the family is keeping her away from public places.

"We've had to change the way we live because of a small minority of people," said her father. "It's very inconvenient." But more than inconvenient, he says, it's emotionally difficult. They fear that despite their best efforts, she could still catch the virus. "It makes you worried all the time," said the father, who lives in Monsey.

He knows how horrible measles can be. His nephew recently caught measles and had to be hospitalized.

He said a friend of his wife's was vaccinated as a child but also recently caught the virus. She had a high fever for weeks and, at one point, couldn't see. He said she described having measles as "the worst thing that had ever happened to me" and said the pain of childbirth paled in comparison.

"She said, 'It was like every part of my body felt on fire. It was like somebody was inside my body with a bulldozer, destroying organ by organ,' " the father said.

He doesn't want that to happen to his baby.

There have been measles cases in 23 states this year [2019], but the outbreak in New York has been particularly hard to beat. Of the 60 new cases reported nationwide this week [week of 6 May 2019] by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 52 have been in New York, with 41 in New York City and 11 in Rockland county, about an hour north of the city, where the family lives.

Last week[week of 29 Apr 2019], Demetre Daskalakis, New York City's deputy health commissioner, said the outbreak isn't under control "because we have people actively working against us."

He was referring to anti-vaccination propaganda claiming that the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps, and rubella, causes autism and other health issues -- which is scientifically inaccurate.

About 73% of children ages 1 to 18 in Rockland county have received an MMR vaccine, according to the county.

[13] Risk for immunocompromised patients

https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/cancer-patients-fear-measles-has-upended-daily-routines-n1002746


For cancer patients, fear of measles has upended daily routines.

With measles scares happening everywhere from movie theaters to cruise ships to planes, individuals with compromised immune systems and their families are upending their daily routines to avoid getting the highly contagious disease. They are staying away from public spaces, placing panicked calls to their doctors, and taking to social media to implore others who can get vaccinated to do so.

And unlike vaccine-hesitant parents who choose not to give their children the measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine based on arguments discounted by science or those who object for religious reasons, many with weakened immunity desperately want to get the shot to protect themselves -- but cannot.

[A cancer patient] got all her vaccinations long before she got cancer. But her leukemia treatment removed them from her immune system's memory.

Dr Bill Moss, an epidemiologist, pediatrician, and interim executive director of the International Vaccine Access Center at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said most of the research that has been done on the effect of measles on people with compromised immunity was on those with HIV.

"People who are immunocompromised are more likely to get severe measles, more likely to die from measles, and more likely to have unusual presentations of it," he said, adding that they may not develop the recognizable rash typically associated with measles, leading to the virus going undiagnosed for longer.

[Immunocompromised people are at high risk for severe disease from most infections that may have a much milder impact on those with fully functioning immune systems. They must take extreme precautions to prevent exposure to infectious agents. Establishment and maintenance of high levels of immunity in the population to vaccine-preventable diseases protects these individuals. With the current anti-vaccination movement, their health and well-being is in greater jeopardy. - Mod.LK]
