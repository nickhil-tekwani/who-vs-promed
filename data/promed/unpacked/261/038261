According to FVO [Food and Veterinary Office], the results of laboratory tests received today [30 Jun 2014] confirm African swine fever [ASF] in 2 additional wild boars.

So far, the disease has been confirmed in 7 wild boars and 3 domestic pigs. The carcasses of the wild boars have been incinerated.

FVO inspectors have checked 324 farms within the protection and surveillance zones, of which 69 included pig holdings. During the inspections, the inspectors found pig movement violations in 26 farms. [The press release includes several imposed requirements, such as animal movement restrictions, keeping domestic pigs housed to prevent their possible contact with wild boars, the need for immediate notification of suspected cases, etc.]
