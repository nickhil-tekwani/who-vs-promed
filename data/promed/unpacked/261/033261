Animal health authorities in Texas have confirmed the 13th case of the insect-borne disease, vesicular stomatitis, in a horse in the state.

The Texas Animal Health Commission said it had received confirmation of the latest case in Nueces County in South Texas. The property is 10.2 miles south of Mathis, close to where the 12th case was reported.

To date [8 Jul 2014], 7 properties in 4 Texas counties have been confirmed with the disease, which has signs similar to those of foot-and-mouth disease.

All cases have tested positive for the New Jersey serotype.

The latest property has been placed under quarantine. All affected horses are being monitored by regulatory veterinarians.

On 28 May 2014, the commission announced the 1st cases of vesicular stomatitis in the US this year, involving 5 horses in Kinney County.

Three additional infected horses, in Hidalgo County in southern Texas, were confirmed early in June [2014]. Two of the horses were 24 miles northwest of Edinburg, the other 3 miles northwest of Edinburg.

Then, cases were confirmed in 3 horses in San Patricio County in southern Texas. Two of the horses were 7.5 miles southeast of Mathis. The other was about 7 miles southeast of Mathis.

Several states have tightened entry requirements on Texas livestock, including horses, due to the cases.

Vesicular stomatitis can cause blisters and sores in the mouth and on the tongue, muzzle, teats or hooves of horses, cattle, swine, sheep, goats, llamas and a number of other animals [see photo of horse at source URL].

Lesions usually heal in 2 or 3 weeks.

Because of the contagious nature of the disease, which has signs similar to foot-and-mouth disease, animal health officials urge livestock owners and caretakers to report these signs to their veterinarian immediately.

Most animals recover well with supportive care by a veterinarian, but some lesions can be painful.

It is thought that insects are an important vector in the transmission of the disease.

The last confirmed cases in Texas were in 2009.

[Vesicular stomatitis (VS) virus is one of those interesting diseases that emerges every once in a while without much warning, until it bursts uninvited into our livestock population. It does not occur every year, but it has occurred almost yearly in the past several years.

There are 2 major serotypes: New Jersey and Indiana.

The problem with vesicular stomatitis is 2-fold. One, there is inevitably a disruption of production in cattle; not only will the sick animal produce less, but disease management tactics must be very stringent. The 2nd problem is that the clinical signs are similar to those of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), with which it can easily be confused (though horses are resistant to FMD and susceptible to VS).

In this case, the diagnosis of the disease in an equine 1st forestalls any worry about FMD, until an animal susceptible to FMD, such as a bovine, appears with similar clinical signs. Consequently, surveillance must be ever vigilant. Likewise, it seems that states will slam their doors shut to animals from a state that has experienced this disease.

VS can be transmitted by contamination by transcutaneous or transmucosal route and by arthropod transmission (_Phlebotomus_, _Aedes_, etc.). Incubation of the disease may be as long as 21 days.

According to the OIE, clinical signs can be summarized as follows:
- excessive salivation;
- blanched raised or broken vesicles of various sizes in the mouth:
-- Horses: upper surface of the tongue, surface of the lips and around nostrils, corners of the mouth, and the gums;
-- Cattle: tongue, lips, gums, hard palate, and sometimes muzzle and around the nostrils;
-- Pigs: snout
- lesions involving feet of horses and cattle are not exceptional;
- teat lesions occur in dairy herds;
- foot lesions and lameness are frequent in pigs;
- recovery in around 2 weeks;
- complication: loss of production and mastitis in dairy herds due to secondary infections, lameness in horses
