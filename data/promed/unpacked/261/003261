The National Institute of Health is evaluating 2567 suspected cases of measles and 384 suspected cases of rubella that have infected Colombians and visitors.

The Ministry of Health also confirmed that there are 29 cases of measles and 18 rubella in Colombia, the vast majority of them imported from people from Venezuela.

The cases studied of measles since [3 Mar 2018] to date [22 Jun 2018], have been identified in departments and cities such as Antioquia, Bolívar, Cartagena, Cauca, Cesar, Norte of Santander, Risaralda, Santa Marta, Sucre and Bogotá.

The health authorities revealed in the epidemiological bulletin that there are 7 cases of 2ary transmission of Venezuelans residing in Colombia for more than 4 months, without a clear vaccination report.

The health surveillance system added that 2 cases in Venezuelan citizens are also being monitored because of the evolution of the disease.

[The impact of the poor economic situation in Venezuela has had repercussions in healthcare including lapses in vaccination for vaccine-preventable diseases. This has fueled measles transmission in countries where Venezuelans have migrated.

The World Health Organization Measles and Rubella Laboratory Network (LabNet) provides for standardized testing in 183 countries and supports genetic characterization of currently circulating strains of measles viruses. Sequence information has proven to be extremely useful for tracking global transmission patterns. The WHO currently recognizes 8 clades of measles virus with at least 23 genotypes. This diversity aids in tracking movement of the virus.

There have been more than 150 cases of measles reported in Wales since the start of the year [2018] - nearly 3 times as many as last year [2017].

Young people heading off on holiday to Europe, where there are large outbreaks of measles, are being encouraged to check they have had both MMR doses as many missed out when vaccination rates dropped in the early 2000s due to unfounded fears over the vaccine.

From the start of the year up to [17 Jun 2018], a total of 155 suspected cases of measles were reported in Wales alone to Public Health England (PHE) (which collects reports for both England and Wales).

Cases across England and Wales have now exceeded 1500 in 2018. The number of reports is 2.7 times higher than the 58 cases reported in the same 24 weeks in 2017.

Cardiff saw the highest number of reports in the first 24 weeks of the year [2018], with 41, up from 1 in the same period in 2017. It was followed by Blaenau Gwent, Neath Port Talbot and Rhondda Cynon Taf with 17 cases each, up from 2, 4 and 4 respectively, with 13 cases in Caerphilly, 7 each in Flintshire and Newport, and 6 each in Monmouthshire and Torfaen.

In the 24 weeks ending [17 Jun 2018], some 1525 suspected cases of measles were reported to Public Health England (PHE) across England and Wales.

The number of reports is much higher than over the same period in recent years. There were 713 cases reported in 2017 as well as 753 in 2016, 618 in 2015, and 1055 in 2014.

However numbers are lower than in previous outbreaks with 1985 cases reported in the first 24 weeks of 2012 and 4602 cases in the same period in 2013.

Public Health England is encouraging young people to make sure they have had both doses of the MMR vaccine before going on holiday to Europe where there are large outbreaks of measles.

[As stated in the previous ProMED measles post, young people in England should be sure they are up to date on vaccination with MMR even if they do not plan to travel in Europe, because the infection rate in England itself is also very high. See next post as well, where the high infection rate in England is thought to be due to low immunization rate with MMR vaccine.

There have been more than 80 cases of measles in the West Midlands since the start of the year [2018].

Young people are being encouraged to make sure they have had both doses of the MMR vaccine before going on holiday to Europe, where there are large outbreaks of the disease.

Cases of measles also continue to rise across England in unvaccinated people of this age. Between 1 Jan and 18 Jun [2018], there have been 643 laboratory confirmed measles cases in England, including 82 in the West Midlands.

The vaccine is available for free to anyone who has not received both doses as a child. It protects against measles, mumps and rubella - all of which can be very serious diseases and are highly infectious.

Dr. Bharat Sibal, Public Health England West Midlands lead health protection consultant, said:

"Measles is a highly infectious viral illness that can sometimes lead to extremely serious complications. In the early 2000s there was a fall in MMR vaccination coverage in children and as a consequence we are now seeing measles cases in young adults - where the infection can have severe consequences, with a higher likelihood of hospitalisation.

"Since the start of November 2017, there has been an ongoing outbreak of measles in the West Midlands region, with 116 cases documented. With outbreaks across England and Europe, it is vital that anyone who hasn't had 2 doses of the MMR vaccine contacts their GP to get up to date, especially before going on holiday.(...-more)"

While vaccine uptake levels in the UK in young children are currently very high, coverage levels dipped to a low of 80 per cent in 2003. This means that there are significant numbers of unprotected teenagers and young adults who could catch measles, particularly in environments of close mixing such as summer festivals and when they travel abroad for the summer holidays.

The Institute of Public Health of Serbia reported this week on the measles situation in the country. From October [2017] through [21 Jun 2018], 5598 measles cases were recorded, of which 2837 were laboratory confirmed at the Torlak Institute.

During this time, 15 measles related deaths were registered. As many as 33 percent of the patients required hospitalization because of the complications associated with measles; 565 people had pneumonia and 2 cases of encephalitis.

The majority of patients are in age groups younger than 5 and over 30 years of age, and 95 percent of those infected were either unvaccinated, incomplete vaccinated or unknown vaccine status.

Japan's National International Health Regulations Focal Point (NFP) notified WHO of an ongoing outbreak of measles in Japan. From [1 Jan 2018] through [20 May 2018], 161 cases of measles were diagnosed, including 145 (90 percent) laboratory-confirmed cases.

Cases were reported from the following prefectures: Okinawa (88 cases); Aichi (25 cases); Fukuoka (17 cases); Tokyo (11 cases); Saitama (6 cases); Ibaraki and Kanagawa (3 cases from each prefecture); Yamanashi and Osaka (2 cases from each prefecture); and Chiba, Shizuoka, Hyogo, and Yamaguchi (one case from each prefecture).

Among the total cases, to date, information for 30 cases regarding their isolated measles virus genotype have been received through the national surveillance system; excluding 1 case with vaccine strain, 25 were genotype D8 and 4 were genotype B3.

Cases of imported measles continue to occur in Japan. Japan has successfully eliminated endemic measles transmission and sustained this status since March 2015 through both high vaccination coverage and rapid detection of and response to every case of measles. In 2016, routine vaccination coverage was 97 percent for the 1st dose (1 year of age) and 93 percent for the 2nd dose (year before entrance to primary school, usually 5 years of age); serological surveys have confirmed that the proportion of antibody-positive (particle agglutination titer equal or higher than 16) individuals aged 2 years or more has remained at 95 percent or above nationally.

[This measles outbreak in Japan is a good example of why it is important, even in a country where endemic measles has been eliminated, to maintain a fully vaccinated population.

Health authorities are concerned by the high number of measles cases with a 22.3 percent increase compared to the first 5 months last year [2017]. Health director-general Datuk Dr. Noor Hisham Abdullah said this in a statement which he had posted on his Facebook account.

"Until 31 May this year [2018], there are 724 cases of measles nationwide compared to 592 cases for the same period last year [2017].

"For the period between September 2017 and February 2018, Malaysia ranks 10th place for countries with the highest number of measles cases after the Philippines and China," he said after chairing a meeting with senior health management officers including state health directors.

The main contributor to the rising number of measles cases was due to low MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) immunisation coverage, he added. Dr. Noor Hisham said in 2016, the MMR immunisation coverage on 12-month-old babies stood at 94.37 percent and it dropped to 92.08 percent in 2017, adding the 2017 data was still preliminary. "We need more than 95 percent immunisation coverage to provide herd immunity for measles."
