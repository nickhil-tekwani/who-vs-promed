Status Report No.6, 27 Jul 2007: results autopsy clearly point to
phocine distemper
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
According to Tero Harkonnen from the Swedish National History Museum,
recently diseased seals, or seals with final-stage symptoms of
phocine distemper virus (PDV) are now stranding along the Swedish
coast. The Museum's very experienced veterinarian Anders Bergman has
carried out a detailed autopsy on the harbour seal shot at the island
Ven in the resund, and it showed all typical pathological changes
indicative of phocine distemper.
Although sequencing of the virus is important to look into mutation
rates, and to identify the strain etc., earlier experience shows that
seals with the symptoms found in the resund seal all proved to be
positive for PDV in later analyses. One should therefore be careful
to speculate about other infective agents causing the seal deaths in
the Kattegat. The epidemiology of this outbreak differs from the 2
earlier ones since a large proportion of the population is immune to
PDV after the 2002 epidemic.
Virological samples from some 15 seals and a number of harbour
porpoises (of which unusually many have stranded) have been shipped
to Dr. Tom Barrett at IAH in England for sequencing. The 1st results
are expected by the end of next week [30 Jul - 4 Aug 2007].

Status Report No.5, 25 Jul 2007: Seal epidemic spreading into
Skagerrak and Baltic
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Yesterday [24 Jul 2007], Tero Harkonen of the Swedish National
History Museum has carried out an autopsy on a seal, found at Lysekil
in the southern Skagerrak [a map is included at the above URL]. It
appeared that the seal had all the macroscopic symptoms of phocine distemper.
Meanwhile, Harkonen's assistants have found seals with macroscopic PD
symptoms in the resund area.
The epidemic is apparently spreading north and south into the
Skagerrak and the Baltic area. Virological samples have been taken
from the seals and will be investigated in the coming weeks.
