Milkshakes linked to E. coli illness
------------------------------------
A 15 year old girl was on dialysis yesterday and in "fair to serious"
condition after drinking a milkshake as a birthday treat at a popular
Calgary eatery that health officials say is behind an _Escherichia coli_
infection outbreak.
The Calgary Health Region reports 13 confirmed cases of the illness, all of
them linked to marshmallow milkshakes that an infected employee made at
Peters' drive-in between 22 and 24 Apr 2005. 4 people, including the teen,
were admitted to hospital.
The bacterium, which is found in various foods, can cause diarrhea and
stomach cramps or even kidney failure, especially among children and people
with weak immune systems. The restaurant was temporarily closed, but health
inspectors gave it the green light to reopen this week.

[If the source of the _E. coli_, which is presumed to be O157 given the
development of renal failure, is indeed the milkshake, it is possible that
the milk used was unpasteurized or at least inadequately treated. - Mod.LL]
