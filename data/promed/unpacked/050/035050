Indonesia: New avian influenza patient in West Java
-----------------------------------------------
A 2nd West Java patient has tested positive for the H5N1 bird flu
virus this year, an official said on Wed 7 Feb 2007 after receiving
laboratory test results from the Jakarta-based Health Research and
Development Agency. Yudi Prayudha, head of the West Java Health
Office, said the confirmation came via an SMS message from the
agency. A written report was also expected. "The confirmation should
remind us not to be negligent, since the danger of bird flu
continues," Yudi said in Bandung.
The 30-year-old male patient constituted the 42nd person admitted to
the hospital with a suspected bird flu infection in West Java as of 1
Jan 2007. Another patient who was found to have the virus died on 16
Jan 2007. Overall, 27 patients have tested positive for H5N1 virus
infection in West Java since bird flu arrived in the country in 2005.
Of those, 22 have died. Six of the 27 cases hailed from Bandung regency.
The wife of the most recent patient to test positive said her husband
had raised only 3 chickens in their kitchen and that they were
healthy. She said dozens of her neighbor's fowl had died suddenly,
however, about 500 meters from their house. "My husband got seriously
ill one week before being admitted to hospital," she said.
Meanwhile, bird flu has reemerged in Gowa regency, South Sulawesi,
where about 13 000 fowl raised by local people died suddenly in 2
villages in Bontonompo district. A rapid test of the dead fowl showed
they all had the H5N1 virus. The Gowa Livestock Husbandry Office has
sent samples of the dead chickens' blood to the Veterinary Agency in
Maros for confirmation.
The head of the office, Hatta Kanna, said on Wed 7 Feb 2007 that his
officers had isolated the 2 villages to prevent the spread of the
virus. "Despite the absence [of] confirmation, we have urged local
people not to bring their fowl out of their villages," he said. Hatta
said his officers had also culled 7500 fowl belonging to the
residents of the 2 villages. The disease is endemic in Gowa. The
regency was hit by a similar outbreak in the middle of last year
[2006] when thousands of poultry died.
In a related development, the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta warned its
citizens in Indonesia on Wednesday [7 Feb 2007] that cats may carry
the deadly bird flu virus. Most known cases of human infection with
H5N1 have involved contact with chickens or other infected birds. But
last month [January 2007], experts called for closer monitoring of
other animals after Indonesian scientists found the virus in cats
near poultry markets. "There have been confirmed reports that wild
and stray cats have been shown to carry H5N1," the embassy said in a
notice sent to Americans in Indonesia via e-mail. "While there have
been no documented cases of feline-to-human transmission of H5N1, it
is important to avoid contact with wild and stray cats and to ensure
that domesticated cats do not eat or interact with sick or dying
poultry," the embassy said as reported by Reuters. Wild and stray
cats are ubiquitous in Jakarta.
Indonesia has had the highest number of fatalities of any country in
the world from the bird flu virus, accounting for 63 deaths out of
the global total of 166 over the past 4 years.
