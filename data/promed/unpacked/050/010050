Wildlife biologists say a fungal disease that affects snakes has spread to Tennessee.

The malady can interfere with a snake's vision and, in some cases, can deform a snake's head, making it difficult for it to feed.

The fungus has been found in Tennessee only on timber rattlesnakes. Wildlife biologists in Tennessee say they know of 2 fungal cases in rattlers and they know one is still alive because they tagged it with a radio transmitting device.

The Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency discourages people trying to capture venomous snakes, but asks that if anyone finds a dead snake that appears deformed that the finder reports it.

Infected snakes have also been found in Illinois, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. Illinois has seen multiple deaths of infected snakes over the last several years.

[Snake fungal disease (SFD) is an emerging disease in certain populations of wild snakes in the eastern and midwestern United States. In recent years, cases of this fungal infection have been increasing.

The disease is apparently caused by the fungus _Ophidiomyces (formerly _Chrysosporium_) ophiodiicola_. The National Wildlife Health Center has confirmed the disease in 9 states, including Tennessee. The timber rattlesnake (_Crotalus horridus_) (see picture at http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/Crotalus_horridus_1.jpg), has previously been reported with the disease.

Research should address the investigation of the factors that determine an apparent increase in the incidence of this disease in natural snake populations.
