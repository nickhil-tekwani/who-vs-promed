Alan Boucher, a seed potato specialist for the Canadian Food
Inspection Agency (CFIA), has confirmed preliminary tests that Potato
mop-top pomovirus (PMTV) is present in potato in P.E.I. and other
provinces.

Boucher says quarantine measures will be continued at so-called
suspect fields. Fields were also quarantined in Nova Scotia, according
to other media reports. Boucher offered reassurances to people in the
industry, stating he was confident the CFIA had taken appropriate steps
to contain the spread of the disease, which has been found in 8
American states. Shipments of potatoes, especially seed potatoes, from
those states, have not been allowed to cross the Canadian border.

The seed potatoes that have tested positive in preliminary results are
from original seed from Maine, where PMTV first appeared.

In the U.S. growers organizations have called for PMTV to be taken off
the quarantine pest list, and designated as a manageable pest.

[The significance of this report is that PMTV has been confirmed to be
present in seed potatoes imported into Canada from the United States; a
prior ProMED-Plant post had indicated the possibility of the virus
being present in such potatoes. An earlier report indicated that 11 states
were affected but that some of the shipments did not originate from the
states originally identified in their shipping documents. CFIA now
requires that shipping documents clearly indicate the state of origin of
all potato lots imported from the United States. Consequently,
California, Delaware, and New Jersey were removed from the list of
PMTV-affected states. According to a CFIA Information Bulletin
issued on 2 Oct 2002, some imported potatoes from 8 states (Florida,
Idaho, Maine, Maryland, North Carolina, Oregon, Virginia, and
Washington) are infected by PMTV.

As of 19 Aug 2002, tests on 2500 truckloads of potatoes showed that
115 samples were infected by PMTV. Mop-top has been recorded in
private gardens in Canada, but today's announcement is the first to
record the disease in commercial potatoes in the country. The CFIA has
yet to reveal the identities of the other provinces in which PMTV has
been found.
