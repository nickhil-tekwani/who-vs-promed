Argentina finds 25 FMD cases in Patagonia
-------------------------------------------
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina - An official with the Argentine National Agrifood
Health and Quality Service (Senasa) was cited as saying that Argentine
animal health officials found 25 animals out of a total of 156 in the
outbreak zone and measures have been taken to contain the infection. The
outbreak was found in the Pichimaguida department of Rio Negro province,
some 620 miles south of capital city Buenos. This was the second outbreak
detected in the region, he added. Patagonia had been the only region of
Argentina considered free of the highly contagious disease with the use of
vaccinations.
Argentina lost its prized status as free of the disease and consequently
access to most of its major export markets for beef in March. In 2000 the
country had shipped $600 million worth of meat. The government began a
program to vaccinate 98 percent of Argentina's nearly 50 million head of
cattle in April in an effort to stop the spread of the disease.

[A quick check with an atlas puts this outbreak somewhere near Latitude 42'
South and north of Trelew & Rawson. In their previously successful
eradication program using vaccination, Patagonia had been excepted as it
did not at that time have FMD. Many years ago there had been an outbreak in
Tierra del Fuego. Because of the very low density of stocking and the very
dry climate it is a region that is not normally perceived as being at risk.
Checking the OIE reports Argentina has not
reported this disease in Patagonia before this year and the July
HandiStatus figures show 101 new outbreaks, not broken down by province.
Thus the date of the first Patagonian case is unknown. If tracing has been
done to explain these cases it has yet to be reported. Logically it would
have been through the movement of convalescent livestock shedding virus.
Normally the transport of such animals is forbidden. - Mod.MHJ
