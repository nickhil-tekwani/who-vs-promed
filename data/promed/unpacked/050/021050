Tour groups contract dysentery fever in Bali
--------------------------------------------
In the wake of the rising number of dysentery cases among tourists
recently returned from the Indonesian resort island of Bali, the
[Taiwanese] Center for Disease Control (CDC) yesterday, Sun, 23 Nov
2003, disclosed the list of travel agencies which organized these
group tours.
The advisory came as the Department of Health yesterday urged Taiwan
tourists returning from Bali before the end of this month to take
their own temperatures twice a day for 4 days and ask for medical
treatment if they have symptoms of diarrhea and vomiting.
According to the CDC, over 40 people who recently traveled to Bali in
groups have shown signs of dysentery, such as diarrhea, fever and
vomiting. At least 25 people, who belonged to 15 different tour
groups were affected with Shigella dysentery. The tally is expected
to go up as members of 2 more groups were reported to have developed
dysentery-like symptoms and 304 people, including tourists and their
relatives, have been put on observation.
It was speculated that the tourists have contracted the disease via
contaminated water or food or from dysentery-affected restaurant
staff on the Indonesian island. All of the tour groups have been to 3
popular restaurants in Bali, noted Shih Wen-yi, deputy
director-general of the CDC.
Shih added that there was no direct evidence pointing to the
restaurants as the sources of infections. The travel agencies
association will, however, request its members to stop using at least
2 of the 3 restaurants implicated.
Announcing the name of travel agencies and their itineraries, the DOH
urged those who returned from Bali between 7 Nov and 22 Nov 2003, and
have shown signs such as diarrhea, fever and vomiting to contact
health authorities. Shih noted that Shigella dysentery, which is
spread via food and direct contact, is highly contagious, but some of
the affected will not display any obvious signs. To prevent a
large-scale dysentery outbreak, Shih suggested those who recently
visited Bali but have no dysentery symptoms to also undergo
screenings at local health stations. Regardless of a spate of
dysentery cases, an immediate travel ban on Bali is unlikely,
according to the Tourism Bureau and travel agencies association.
It was reported that all of the tour groups are expected to depart
for Bali as scheduled, at least within the next few days. An
estimated 300 000 to 400 000 people visited Indonesia each year, with
Bali as the single most popular destination. Winter is the peak
season for group tours to Bali.
