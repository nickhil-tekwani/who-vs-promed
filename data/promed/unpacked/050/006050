The Public Health Agency of Canada is collaborating with federal and provincial public health partners to investigate an outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] infantis in 8 provinces. At this time, no source has been identified, and the investigation is ongoing.

The risk to Canadians is low. Salmonella bacteria are found naturally in the intestines of animals, reptiles and birds. The bacteria are most-often transmitted to people when they eat contaminated foods. Contaminated foods often come from animal sources, like poultry, beef, milk or eggs, but can also include fruits, vegetables, and herbs. Illness can be avoided if safe food handling, preparation, and cooking practices are closely followed.

Investigation Summary
----------------------
Currently, there are 34 cases of _S._ infantis illness in 8 provinces: British Columbia (3), Alberta (6), Saskatchewan (2), Manitoba (2), Ontario (16), Quebec (3) Nova Scotia (1), and New Brunswick (1). Individuals became sick between 12 Jun 2015 and 20 Sep 2015. The majority of cases (62 percent) are female, with an average age of 41 years. Eight people have been hospitalized, and all have recovered or are recovering. No deaths have been reported.

To date, the source of this investigation has not been identified, but the investigation is ongoing, and Canadians will continue to be updated as new information becomes available.
