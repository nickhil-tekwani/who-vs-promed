MICROBIAL HAZARDS AND EMERGING ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCE: A
PRELIMINARY REPORT TO THE NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON MICROBIOLOGIC
CRITERIA FOR FOODS, Nov. 1997
R. TAUXE, H. KRUSE, C. HEDBERG, M. POTTER, J. MADDEN, AND K. WACHSMUTH
ABSTRACT
In the past two decades, the consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables in
the United States has increased, and the geographic sources and
distribution of fresh produce have expanded greatly. Concomitantly, public
health officials have documented an increase in the number of reported
produce-associated foodborne disease outbreaks in the United States. The
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that the number of
these outbreaks doubled between 1973 and 1987, and 1988 and 1991, and that
the number of cases of illness associated with these outbreaks more than
doubled. A variety of produce items have been affected. During 1995
alone, major outbreak investigations linked infections with _Salmonella_
serotype Stanley to alfalfa sprouts, _Salmonella hartford_ to unpasteurized
orange juice, _Shigella_ sp. to lettuce and green onions, _E. coli_ 0157:H7
to lettuce, and hepatitis A virus to tomatoes. In response to this
apparent increase, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration asked the National
Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods to address and
better define the association of foodborne disease and microbial pathogens
with fresh produce. A subcommittee formed in June 1995 is documenting
relevant epidemiologic data, current industry practices, and laboratory
data to identify potential hazards and related control strategies. This
report presents the preliminary findings of that subcommittee.
