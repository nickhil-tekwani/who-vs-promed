French investigators are examining whether a lorry driver has become
the 1st victim of a toxic seaweed that is clogging parts of the Brittany coast.

The driver died in July 2009 after carrying 3 truckloads of sea
lettuce away from the beaches where it has been decaying, releasing
poisonous gas.

His death was originally recorded as a heart attack, but prosecutors
want to know if it was linked to the seaweed.

France's PM warned of the health risk while visiting the beaches last
month [August 2009].

Francois Fillon announced that the government would pay for cleaning
up the beaches polluted by the sea lettuce, _Ulva lactuca_.

Locals had raised the alarm after a horse, being ridden over the
sands, collapsed and died. Its rider fell unconscious and had to be
dragged off the algae-coated beach.

By then, the lorry driver had already died.

The 48-year-old driver had been working without a mask or gloves and
died at the wheel of his vehicle when it crashed into a wall, reports
Tim Finan in Brittany for the BBC.

The man had been part of the annual operation to remove 2000 tonnes
of rotting sea lettuce from the beaches at Binic.

His family has so far refused to allow an autopsy to establish the
exact cause of his death, but on Monday [7 Sep 2009], the local
prosecutor ordered a preliminary investigation.

Christian Urvoy, the mayor of Binic, said: "We want to know if in
future we should take precautions to safeguard workers who collect or
transport seaweed."

A spokesman for the local authorities has strongly denied they were
aware of the death when Mr Fillon visited St-Michel-en-Greve in August 2009.

Researchers from France's National Institute for Environmental
Technology and Hazards (Ineris) have visited the same beach and found
hydrogen sulfide in such concentration that it could be "deadly in
few minutes."

Sea lettuce is harmless in the sea, but as it decomposes on the
beach, it releases the deadly gas.

Environmentalists say decades of misuse of Brittany's agricultural
land is to blame for the explosion of algae, due to the high levels
of nitrates used in fertilisers and excreted by the region's high
concentration of livestock.

They have called for tighter controls on farming.

[The driver should have been wearing personal protective equipment,
especially a respirator. Hopefully the lab will be able to determine
if this death was related to the hydrogen sulfide, but due to the
interval between death and the testing, that may not be possible.

rotting sea lettuce, readers are encouraged to see the moderator's
