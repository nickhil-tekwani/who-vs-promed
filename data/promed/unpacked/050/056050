An outbreak of anthrax in the remote areas has been reported from
Visakhapatnam district of Andhra Pradesh. According to the Labburu Primary
Health Centre, nearly 51 cases of anthrax are reported so far. Out of this,
11 people [have] died and 5 persons are showing the symptoms of anthrax.

To allay the panic among the people, a medical official has announced that
all possible measures were taken to counter the disease. "The special team
will visit the houses. We are recommending to all these families that they
must resort to tablets. All the steps required are being taken up. I would
like to appeal that there is no reason to panic," said Janardhan Rao, a doctor.

[I suspect that what the report above is trying to say is that the Labburu
Primary Health Centre is observing 51 people and of those 11 have died and
5 are clinically ill. I would suspect that the remaining 35 may be
receiving prophylactic oral antibiotics. - Mod.MHJ

A further report received later (via Mod.MPP) expressed similar numbers a
little differently

Bhadrachalam CPM Lok Sabha MP M Babu Rao on Saturday [9 May 2009] demanded
that a health emergency be declared in the Visakha agency [tribal] areas
with the reports of more and more anthrax cases coming from the border
mandals [districts]. He demanded the state government to implement
recommendations of various committees by recruiting sufficient doctors and
health staff to improve the medical condition of the tribals. Babu Rao told
newspersons that the tribals need to be provided with work as part of the
National Employment Assurance Scheme.

Seventeen tribals died of anthrax and diarrhoea in the past 2 months in the
agency mandals. Deaths of 937 cattle were reported in Munchingput mandal
alone, but the government has not taken any measures to stop the deaths of
the tribals, Babu Rao regretted.

The authorities should take up construction of water tanks and install
borewells in each village of the agency mandal. The MP [member of
parliament] asked the government to recruit necessary number of veterinary
doctors and the staff and ensure a better implementation of the free
insurance scheme for the cattle. "There is hardly any agricultural output
because of the prevailing drought conditions. We brought to the notice of
the state government about the prevailing conditions there 3 months ago.
But till today, the government has not initiated any action in this
regard," he said.

Babu Rao said there were 197 water springs in the 11 agency mandals in
Visakha with scope for water supply extension to 346 villages. But the
government has not taken care about this provision, he alleged. The
proposals of the Rs 7.5 crore [USD 1.52 million] Gravity Water Scheme were
sent to the state government by Paderu ITDA project officer in 2005. No
action was taken on this too. The CPM would conduct ganji-ambali kendras
[community outreach meeting at village level. - Mod.MHJ] in the anthrax
affected Karlapodur, Mebha villages of Munchingput mandal from 11 May
[2009], the MP said.

[We try to avoid posting political statements but it seems from MP Babu
Rao's "demands" that there has been an ongoing anthrax problem in Visakha
with significant livestock deaths and associated human cases, which has
been affected by levels of health and veterinary staffing and support in
the area. Regular annual vaccination of livestock can prevent livestock
deaths with minimal cost and maximum efficacy. Informed clarification by
our Indian members in Andhra Pradesh would be welcome.
