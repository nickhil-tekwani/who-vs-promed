WHO Warns of Rapid Spread of Skin Disease in Afghanistan
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
KABUL, 5 May 2002 -- The World Health Organization (WHO) warned
that cutaneous leishmaniasis may rapidly spread in Afghanistan.
Cutaneous leishmaniasis has affected 100 000 people in the capital
Kabul so far this year, WHO spokesperson Loretta Hieber-Girardet told
reporters.
Leishmaniasis, which is known as saldana, or one-year sore, in local
language, is caused by a parasite transmitted by the sand fly. It starts
with a lesion on the area of the body that has been bitten, usually on
the face. The lesion rapidly gives rise to a harsh-looking large ulcer.
The most common type of the disease can be transmitted from human
to human after the sand fly bites the lesion and then bites another
human being. Hieber-Girardet said the WHO, together with local health
officials, is fighting an uphill battle to control the disease, owing to the
fact that not enough attention is being given to the disease. The disease
has reached epidemic proportions because no public control measures
have been put in place for the last decade, she said. "The medical
supplies to treat this disease are very limited. In fact, there are only
medical supplies for about 70 000 cases, and we are expecting at least a
quarter of a million (cases) this year."
She said at least half a million U.S. dollars are needed to control the
spread of the disease in Kabul. Some 300 000 dollars are for medicines
to treat the disease and 200 000 dollars for bed nets for people who
have already been affected. The distribution of bed nets, which are
used to stop contacts with the sand fly and the affected persons, are
included in the campaign. The spokesperson said more cases are
expected in Kabul as the movement of a large number of returnees to
cities is continuing. According to statistics of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees, about 40 percent of the returnees end up
in urban areas.
Hieber-Girardet said the disease has also been found in Pakistan. In
Kurram Agency in the northwest frontier province, over 5000 new
cases of leishmaniasis were detected in the past year. Hieber- Girardet
said the WHO believes the outbreak was linked to the massive presence
of Afghans in the region because Pakistan used to have very tight
control of the disease and leishmaniasis cases were rare in the country.
In Sindh Province in south Pakistan, some 9000 people have been
affected. But the outbreak there has been found to have been
transmitted by animals [dogs, wild rodents - Mod.JW] rather than
humans. In Afghanistan, leishmaniasis is a highly socially stigmatized
issue. In Afghanistan, a girl whose face is scarred by the disease may
not be considered a prime choice for marriage, thus limiting her
chances for a normal future, the WHO spokesperson said. Afghan
women with leishmaniasis would not be allowed to feed their children,
and their husbands would not have contacts with them, she said.

[Leishmania is endemic in Afghanistan and has probably been
underreported under the Taliban regime. The infection is linked to
poor social conditions, especially lack of hygiene and poor removal of
waste material. However, the international population in Kabul is also
at risk. Leishmaniasis can be completely cured, provided treatment is
available. However, many Afghans are not aware of how the disease is
transmitted and usually delay treatment. Â­ Mod.EP]
