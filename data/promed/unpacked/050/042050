In a follow-up on the mumps outbreaks in Arkansas and Oklahoma, health officials in Arkansas have seen the outbreak top 200 cases with official suspected and lab confirmed cases now at 210.

The outbreak affects 30 schools in the Huntsville, Rogers, and Springdale School Districts in northwest Arkansas.

In the mumps outbreak in Garfield County, Oklahoma, the number of cases has risen to 14, up 10 cases in less than a week. State and local public health officials are working closely with schools and healthcare providers to rapidly identify suspected cases and exclude affected persons from childcare centers, schools or workplaces during the timeframe they are able to transmit mumps to other persons.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), mumps is a viral illness that is transmitted by direct contact with respiratory droplets or saliva from an infected person. It is best known for painful, swollen salivary glands that show up as puffy cheeks and swollen jaw. Boys may also have painful, swollen testicles. Other symptoms include fever, headache, muscles aches, tiredness, and loss of appetite. There is no treatment, and symptoms usually resolve themselves within a few weeks. Mumps is usually a mild disease in children, but adults may have more serious disease with complications.

The measles mumps rubella [MMR] vaccine is safe and effective. Two doses of MMR vaccine is 88 percent effective in preventing mumps

The mumps outbreak that has affected 3 counties in northwest Arkansas continues to grow. As of Friday [30 Sep 2016], The Arkansas Department of Health (ADH) puts the case count at 376 under investigation.

Benton, Washington, and Madison, all in the northwestern corner of the state, remain the only counties involved.

ADH reports the outbreak has affected 11 workplaces and 3 school districts and 35 schools in the above counties.

Two-thirds of the cases are reported in school aged children (242), prompting health officials to target the outbreak response to minimizing transmission within the impacted schools. ADH is requiring students who have a mumps, measles, and rubella (MMR) vaccine exemption to be excluded from school for 26 days from the date of exposure or for the duration of the outbreak, whichever is longer.

The MMR vaccine is safe and effective. Two doses of MMR vaccine is 88 percent effective in preventing mumps. It is a live virus vaccine and is not recommended for pregnant women or patients with a weakened immune system. Adults born before 1957 are generally considered to be immune to mumps and do not need to receive the MMR vaccine.

Nationally, the CDC has reported 1897 mumps cases from 44 states through 10 Sep [2016].

San Diego health officials have reported a mumps case in an undergraduate student at California State University San Marcos. The San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency says the student may have exposed others on campus between 6-9 and 12-14 [Sep 2016].

The student lived off campus and was up-to-date with mumps vaccinations, but was diagnosed with the highly contagious viral disease by blood tests reported to the County this week. The student was not hospitalized and has recovered.

Individuals can become ill with mumps 12-25 days after exposure.

This case is not related to the possible mumps exposure at the Casbah music venue on 28 Aug [2016]. It is not known where the student was exposed to the viral illness.

"Cal State San Marcos is working closely with the County to notify individuals who were directly exposed to the person with mumps," said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. "We are encouraging immunizations for students and staff who are not up-to-date."

Mumps is a highly contagious viral disease. It is spread by coughing, sneezing or close contact with an infected person. Mumps causes a fever, headache, earache, and inflammation of the salivary glands which results in swelling and tenderness at the angle of the jaw. Anyone who thinks that they may have mumps should contact their provider before going for care so proper precautions can be taken to prevent exposure to others.

Severe complications are rare, but can include meningitis, decreased fertility, permanent hearing loss, and, in extreme cases, fetal loss during 1st trimester of pregnancy. There is no treatment for mumps. Most people recover without problems.

The best way to prevent mumps is by getting the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine. Two doses of the vaccine are recommended -- one at 12 to 15 months of age and another at 4 to 6 years of age. A 3rd booster shot is recommended for those in close living conditions when there is an outbreak.

Mumps is becoming increasingly more common on college campuses in the United States. The disease has been reported on multiple college campuses in 2016 including the State University of New York at Buffalo, Indiana University, University of Kentucky, University of San Diego, University of Southern Maine, Saint Anselm College in New Hampshire and Harvard University [in Massachusetts], among others.

2016 has seen the most mumps cases in the US since 2010. Through 10 Sep [2016], the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported 1897 cases.

[Any location where people are living in close contact is prime territory for spread of infectious diseases like mumps. But what is disturbing about these cases is that many of the students were fully vaccinated. This may indicate a booster is needed before entering college.
