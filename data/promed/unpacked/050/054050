TB found in Alberta cow
-----------------------
Bovine tuberculosis is a contagious and reportable disease in Canada. One case does not affect trade, but there could be repercussions if the disease is found to be more widespread.

An Alberta farm has been quarantined after a positive case of tuberculosis was detected in a cow shipped to the United States for slaughter.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency [CFIA] is investigating and the index herd will be tested, said Rob McNabb of the Canadian Cattlemen's Association.

"They detected some lesions and cultured it and then confirmed and USDA [US Department of Agriculture] notified CFIA. They are just at the early stage of doing the testing and investigation," McNabb said.

The case was detected in September [2016] and was reported on the CFIA website.

Bovine tuberculosis is a contagious and reportable disease in Canada. One case does not affect trade, but there could be repercussions if the disease is found to be more widespread.

"Most of our experience is that these are isolated incidents of one offs and we will keep our fingers crossed that that is the case here," said McNabb.

The last case was found in 2011 in British Columbia. The disease is also found in elk and deer in and around Rounding Mountain National Park in Manitoba and wood bison in northern Alberta and the Northwest Territories in and around Wood Buffalo National Park, according to the CFIA website.

Producers around Riding Mountain National Park are required to have their herds tested for tuberculosis periodically to protect animal health and maintain market access. Testing has been ongoing since 2000, and 32 herds in the area were tested last year [2015].

[The Riding Mountain National Park area has had TB from time to time. Nevertheless, this is not good news for Canadian producers. We know the authorities will be busy testing animals and performing traces both into and out of this herd to determine how many others could be exposed.

Bovine tuberculosis results from infection by _Mycobacterium bovis_, a Gram positive, acid-fast bacterium in the _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ complex of the family Mycobacteriaceae.

This disease is a significant zoonosis that can spread to humans, typically by the inhalation of aerosols or the ingestion of unpasteurized milk. In developed countries, eradication programs have reduced or eliminated tuberculosis in cattle, and human disease is now rare; however, reservoirs in wildlife can make complete eradication difficult.

Cattle shed _M. bovis_ in respiratory secretions, feces and milk, and sometimes in the urine, vaginal secretions or semen. Large numbers of organisms may be shed in the late stages of infection. Asymptomatic and anergic [non-reactive to the tuberculin skin test] carriers occur. In most cases, _M. bovis_ is transmitted between cattle in aerosols during close contact. Some animals become infected when they ingest the organism; this route may be particularly important in calves that nurse from infected cows. Cutaneous, genital, and congenital infections have been seen but are rare. All infected cattle do not transmit the disease. Ingestion appears to be the primary route of transmission in pigs, ferrets, cats and probably deer. In addition, cats can be infected by the respiratory route or via percutaneous transmission in bites and scratches. Nonhuman primates are usually infected by inhalation. Aerosol transmission also seems to be the main route of spread in badgers, but transmission in bite wounds can be significant. Badgers with advanced disease can shed _M. bovis_ in the urine, and organisms have been found in the feces. Due to behavioral changes, badgers and possums are most likely to transmit _M. bovis_ to cattle during the late stages of disease.

_M. bovis_ can infect humans, primarily by the ingestion of unpasteurized dairy products but also in aerosols and through breaks in the skin. Raw or undercooked meat can also be a source of the organism. Person-to-person transmission is rare in immunocompetent individuals, but _M. bovis_ has occasionally been transmitted within small clusters of people, particularly alcoholics or HIV-infected individuals. Rarely, humans have infected cattle via aerosols or in urine.

The clinical signs of bovine tuberculosis usually take months to develop in cattle. Infections can also remain dormant for years and reactivate during periods of stress or in old age.

Tuberculosis is usually a chronic debilitating disease in cattle, but it can occasionally be acute and rapidly progressive. Early infections are often without clinical signs. In countries with eradication programs, most infected cattle are identified early and clinical infections are uncommon. In the late stages, common clinical signs include progressive emaciation, a low-grade fluctuating fever, weakness and inappetence [loss of appetite]. Animals with pulmonary involvement usually have a moist cough that is worse in the morning, during cold weather or exercise, and may have dyspnea or tachypnea [shortness of breath]. In the terminal stages, animals may become extremely emaciated and develop acute respiratory distress. In some animals, the retropharyngeal or other lymph nodes enlarge and may rupture and drain. Greatly enlarged lymph nodes can also obstruct blood vessels, airways, or the digestive tract. If the digestive tract is involved, intermittent diarrhea and constipation may be seen.

Bovine tuberculosis can be controlled by test-and-slaughter or test-and-segregation methods. Affected herds are re-tested periodically to eliminate cattle that may shed the organism; the tuberculin test is generally used. Infected herds are usually quarantined, and animals that have been in contact with reactors are traced. Only test-and-slaughter techniques are guaranteed to eradicate tuberculosis from domesticated animals.

Some human infections are asymptomatic. In other cases, localized or disseminated disease can develop either soon after infection, or many years later when waning immunity allows the infection to reactivate. Localized disease can affect the lymph nodes, skin, bones and joints, genitourinary system, meninges or respiratory system. Cervical lymphadenopathy (scrofula), which primarily affects the tonsillar and pre-auricular lymph nodes, was once a very common form of tuberculosis in children who drank infected milk. In some cases, these lymph nodes rupture and drain to the skin; chronic skin disease (lupus vulgaris) may occasionally result. Humans infected through the skin can develop localized skin disease ("butcher wart"), a form usually thought to be benign and self-limiting. Pulmonary disease is more common in people with reactivated infections than initially; the symptoms may include fever, cough, chest pain, cavitation and hemoptysis [coughing up blood]. Genitourinary disease can result in kidney failure. Bovine tuberculosis can be treated successfully with antimicrobial drugs, but untreated infections may be fatal.

Canada and the USA have a program for TB eradication and worked together for many years to eradicate this disease from the animal populations of bovines and cervids.
