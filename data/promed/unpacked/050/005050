Cows blamed for Ugandan sleeping sickness
-------------------------------------------
LONDON (Reuters) - A recent bout of sleeping sickness in Uganda was spread
by cattle moved around the country, scientists said on Friday.
Eric Fevre and colleagues from the University of Edinburgh found that the
Soroti district, which suffered a serious outbreak in 1998, had seen
large-scale cattle restocking. Domestic livestock are "important
reservoirs" for one of the two protozoa that cause the disease, they said
in a paper published in The Lancet medical journal.
Sleeping sickness is caused by a parasite that infects humans from the bite
of the tsetse fly. The disease is fatal if untreated. The infection causes
flu-like symptoms, inflammation of the brain, behavioral changes, and coma.
The parasite is found in equatorial Africa. An estimated 300 000 people
have the disease.
The researchers found that over half the cattle traded at the Soroti
district's market originated from areas with endemic sleeping sickness.
Prior to restocking, only one case of the disease had been recorded in
Soroti and that was in the mid-1960s.
Proximity to the market was a "highly significant risk factor" for the
disease, with clusters breaking out close by, the researchers found. The
team said cattle should be treated before being moved and warned of an
ongoing problem -- Uganda is restocking on a national scale in an attempt
to tackle poverty.
"This work has clear implications for the spread of the disease," Michael
Barrett, an infection and immunity expert at the University of Glasgow,
told the journal. But he said treatment to stop cattle getting the
non-human form of the disease could reduce the effectiveness of drugs
currently used to tackle the disease in people.

[The Lancet report

emphasizes that sleeping sickness is a zoonosis with its reservoir in wild
and domestic animals. Without control of the infection in the animal
reservoir and the vector, the infection cannot be controlled in the human
population. - Mod.EP
