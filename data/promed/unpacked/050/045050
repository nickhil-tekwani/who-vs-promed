The Ministry of Health is warning passengers on an Emirates flight from
Dubai to Auckland last week to watch for symptoms of measles after one
passenger was found to have the illness [measles]. Emirates flight EK406
departed Dubai on Mon 3 Jan 2011 flying via Melbourne to Auckland on 4 Jan
2011. A passenger who disembarked in Melbourne has been confirmed as a case
of measles. [Flight EK406 is operated by a B777 aircraft seating between
350 and 420 passengers according to configuration. - Mod.CP]

Many other passengers on the flight continued on to Auckland. People
sitting in a row close to the affected passenger are potentially at risk as
measles is easily spread through the air, the Ministry said today [11 Jan
2011]. The Ministry has sent information about the Emirates flight to
public health units around the country.

However there are still around 20 people who sat in the rows nearest the
infected passenger whose current locations in New Zealand were not known.
Dr John Holmes of the Ministry of Health said the symptoms those passengers
need to watch out for are fever, runny nose, and sore eyes followed about 2
days later by a red blotchy rash. Some people develop further complications
such as diarrhoea or a middle ear infection. Any passengers on the flight
who feel unwell should call Healthline on 0800-611-116.

But Holmes said they should not go directly to a doctor's office or to an
emergency department, because they might infect other people. Holmes said
measles is now rare in New Zealand, thanks to vaccination. New Zealand had
3 outbreaks in 2009/2010, each started by people who were infected overseas.

"People tend to underestimate measles -- the reality is it can be a nasty
disease. One in 10 people who catch measles will need to be hospitalised,
which tells you this isn't by any means a mild illness," said Holmes.
"Measles can't be easily treated once you get it, so the best way to
prevent the disease is through immunisation."

The Ministry recommends that anyone aged under 40 who has not had measles
in the past, should ensure they have been vaccinated. If they did not
receive 2 doses of MMR [measles, mumps, and rubella] vaccine when they were
younger, they should contact their doctor to get free immunisation against
measles. "Over the past decade some people declined the combined MMR
vaccination due to false claims that the vaccine was linked with autism.
Just last week a 6 year study published by the British Medical Journal
(BMJ) showed those allegations to be an 'elaborate fraud'," said Holmes.

2011; 342:d22; <http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.d22.full>. - Mod.CP]

International studies over the past decade have also concluded that there
is no link between vaccination and autism, he said.

[Measles is an acute, highly communicable disease, transmitted by direct
contact with infectious droplets or, less commonly, by airborne spread. The
incubation period of measles from exposure to rash onset is generally 14
days (range 7-18). Patients are usually contagious from 4 days before until
4 days after the onset of the rash. Therefore passengers on Emirates flight
EK406 (and any other connecting flight carrying the infected passenger) are
at risk of contracting measles infection if they have never been
vaccinated, or are immune-compromised for any reason. It might be relevant
to extend the New Zealand alert to cover other possible common exposure
points visited by this individual where transmission of disease may have
taken place.
