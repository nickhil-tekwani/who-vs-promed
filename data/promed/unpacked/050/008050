Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report published 2 preliminary studies late last week on Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine safety and efficacy in school-aged children, one finding that serious adverse events in children 5 to 11 years old were rare, and the other showing an estimated 92% effectiveness against infection in 12 to 17-year-olds.

In the first study, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) researchers analyzed data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and the v-safe parental smart phone app on adverse events in children aged 5 to 11 from [3 Nov to 19 Dec 2021]. Median age was 8 years, and 44.6% were boys. [Hause AM, Baggs J, Marquez P, et al. COVID-19 Vaccine Safety in Children Aged 5-11 Years -- United States, 3 Nov - 19 Dec 2021. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2021;70:1755-1760. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm705152a1]

Serious adverse events were defined as those requiring hospitalization or long hospital stays and those that are life-threatening or lead to permanent disability, birth defects, or death.

VAERS received 4249 adverse event reports after administration of 8.7 million COVID-19 vaccine doses to children aged 5 to 11, and 97.6% weren't serious.

Of the 42 504 children in this age-group enrolled in v-safe, 57.5% had local reactions, and 40.9% had systemic reactions, including pain at the injection site, fatigue, and headache. In the week after receipt of the 1st vaccine dose, 54.8% of children had local reactions, while 40.9% had systemic reactions. Adverse systemic reactions were more common in the week after the second dose (40.9%) than after the 1st, with fever occurring in 13.4%, versus 7.9% after the 1st dose.

The most common nonserious events were related to vaccine administration, including no adverse event (27.9%), product preparation issue (22.3%), and incorrect dose (16.3%). The most common conditions and findings among the 100 reports of serious events were fever (29.0%), vomiting (21.0%), and increased troponin, indicating heart damage (15.0%).

Among 12 serious reports of seizure, 1 child had syncope (loss of consciousness after a drop in blood pressure) rather than a seizure, another child may have had syncope, 2 children experienced a fever-related seizure, 1 child had a history of seizures, 2 may have had an evolving seizure disorder, and 5 had new-onset seizures. Of 15 children with preliminary reports of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle), 7 recovered, and 4 were recovering by study end. The deaths of 2 girls aged 5 and 6 years were reported; both had multiple chronic medical conditions and were in poor health before vaccination. No data suggested a causal link between vaccination and death.

The authors noted that their preliminary findings were comparable to those from preauthorization clinical trials. "Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent COVID-19 infection," they wrote. "Parents and guardians of children aged 5 to 11 years should be advised that local and systemic reactions are expected after vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and are more common after the 2nd dose."

The Pfizer vaccine received emergency use authorization for 2 doses administered 3 weeks apart for those ages 5 to 11 on [29 Oct 2021], and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends vaccination for this age-group. Pfizer is the only COVID-19 authorized for children 5 to 17 years.

The 2nd, ongoing, real-world, study -- led by CDC researchers -- involved 243 adolescents 12 to17 years old in Arizona who underwent weekly nasal swab COVID-19 testing and submitted symptom reports for 19 weeks, from [25 Jul to 4 Dec 2021]. The study period was marked by dominance of the delta (B1617.2) variant. [Lutrick K, Rivers P, Yoo YM, et al. Interim Estimate of Vaccine Effectiveness of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) Vaccine in Preventing SARS-CoV-2 Infection Among Adolescents Aged 12-17 Years -- Arizona, July-December 2021. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2021;70:1761-1765. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm705152a2]

Among the adolescents, 190 were fully vaccinated, while 30 were partially vaccinated, and 66 were unvaccinated. Of all participants, 51.4% were boys, 74.5% were 12 -- 15 years, 87.7% were white, 74.5% were non-Hispanic, and 85.2% had private health insurance.

Estimated adjusted vaccine effectiveness (VE) at least 14 days after the 2nd dose, regardless of symptom status, was 92% (95% confidence interval, 79% -- 97%). Twenty-one of 243 participants (8.6%) tested positive for COVID-19, 18 (85.7%) of them reporting symptoms.

Five infections occurred over 21 693 fully vaccinated person-days, for an incidence rate of 0.23 per 1000 person-days. Over 4288 unvaccinated person-days, 16 COVID-19 cases were reported, for an incidence rate of 3.73 per 1000. Two infected participants from the same household sought outpatient care. No COVID-19 cases were identified among partially vaccinated participants.

"The VE estimates described in this report for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in real-world conditions during the period of delta variant predominance corroborate and expand upon the VE estimates from other recent studies in adolescents and reinforce previous findings that current vaccination efforts are resulting in substantial preventive benefits among adolescents aged 12-17 years," the researchers concluded.

[2] Boosters for 12 to 15 year olds
Date: Mon 3 Jan 2022
Source: Yahoo News from Reuters [edited]
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-u-fda-clears-pfizers-144626519.html?.tsrc=374/


The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on [Mon 3 Jan 2022] authorized the use of a 3rd dose of the Pfizer and BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 12 to 15, and narrowed the time for all booster shots by a month to 5 months after the primary doses.

The agency also authorized a 3rd shot for children aged 5 through 11 years who are immunocompromised.

The regulatory decisions come as schools reopen in much of the country, and as COVID-19 cases surge due to the omicron variant of the virus, with health authorities warning that its high transmissibility could overwhelm many health systems. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is expected to weigh in on the changes this week, according to the New York Times. The CDC was not immediately available for comment.

"Based on the FDA's assessment of currently available data, a booster dose of the currently authorized vaccines may help provide better protection against both the delta and omicron variants," said Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.

The U.S. government has been urging vaccinated Americans to get boosters and for the unvaccinated, who are at much higher risk of severe COVID-19 and death, to be inoculated.

So far, 62% of the eligible U.S. population is considered fully vaccinated with a third of them also having received a booster dose.

In making its decision, the FDA said it reviewed real-world data from Israel, including safety data from more than 6300 individuals aged 12 through 15 years who received a booster dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at least 5 months following completion of the primary 2-dose vaccination series.

There were no new cases of a rare type of heart inflammation reported to-date in these individuals, the FDA said.

Laboratory tests have shown that 2 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines generate low immune responses against omicron, while the addition of a booster appears to restore protection against the highly-mutated variant. Two shots of the mRNA vaccine are about 35% effective against infection from the omicron variant, but a booster dose restores effectiveness to 75%, according to the CDC, based on data from South Africa and the United Kingdom.

The FDA said authorizing the shot at 5 months instead of 6 may provide better protection sooner against omicron.

Dr. Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, California, said a 3rd shot is essential to protect against omicron for severe disease. "A good thing here is also the change on the timing of the booster to 5 months instead of 6. That's a big step for this country, which has been resistant to the data," he added.

Countries including the United Kingdom and Israel have narrowed their window for boosters from 6 months to 3 or 4 following the 2nd shot to try to fight the spread of the easily transmitted omicron variant.

Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Institute for Health Security, said he does not believe a booster is necessary for most people since 2 doses of the vaccine have been effective at preventing hospitalizations and severe disease in all but older people. "When I work at the hospital, I don't see patients there because they lack a booster, I see patients because they lack 1st and 2nd doses," Adalja said.

[3] Novavax
Date: Sat 1 Jan 2022
Source: MedPage Today [edited]
https://tinyurl.com/2p88b4vd


In June [2021], MedPage Today wrote about whether Novavax and its "tried-and-true" subunit protein approach to a COVID-19 vaccine could potentially ease vaccine hesitancy. [https://www.medpagetoday.com/special-reports/exclusives/93166]

In this story, we explore what's known about the vaccine and why it still isn't on the market.

Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson: Ask any American, and they'll likely be able to rattle off the trio of COVID-19 vaccines available in the U.S. But what about Novavax's "tried and true" protein subunit vaccine?

Early last year [2021], public health experts told MedPage Today that Novavax -- whose vaccine strategy is used in other vaccines on the market today -- could provide another option to reach the vaccine hesitant. The recombinant nanoparticle technology used in Novavax's protein subunit vaccine candidate (known as NVX-CoV2373) generates full spike protein, and the vaccine is formulated with an adjuvant to enhance immune response and stimulate high levels of neutralizing antibodies, according to the company. The technology is the same as that used in the Flublok influenza vaccine, and is similar to other vaccines that have been around for a long time, like the hepatitis B vaccine.

However, nearly a year later, the Novavax vaccine still isn't available in the U.S. In August [2021], Novavax announced that it was delaying submission of an emergency use authorization (EUA) to the FDA until the 4th quarter.

On [15 Dec 2021], full results from PREVENT-19, Novavax's pivotal phase III trial of its vaccine, were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. [Dunkle LM, Kotloff KL, Gay CL et al. Efficacy and Safety of NVX-CoV2373 in Adults in the United States and Mexico. New England J Medicine. 15 Dec 2021, DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2116185].

The company said in an announcement that the trial achieved its primary endpoint of preventing infection at least 7 days after the 2nd dose. Overall efficacy was 90.4% and efficacy against moderate-to-severe disease was 100%. Adverse events were mostly mild to moderate and transient. Severe reactions were infrequent, and there were no safety concerns related to vaccination.

Novavax did not immediately make a member of leadership available for an interview following the publication of the study. However, a spokesperson told MedPage Today in an email that it expects to submit its complete chemistry, manufacturing, and controls data package to the FDA by the end of 2021.

"We still anticipate a significant market need in the U.S. and globally," the spokesperson said.

At the same time, with the mRNA vaccines already saturating the market, it's not entirely clear how the Novavax vaccine will be rolled out or how it will resonate with consumers in the U.S., should it be granted an EUA from the FDA.

Mayank Mamtani, MSc, a senior biotech analyst and head of healthcare research at B. Riley Securities, told MedPage Today that the way to think about the vaccine is as an alternative to the mRNA vaccines. It is a "very strong vaccine," and while it may come late in the game, it has been differentiated, he noted. "This is a very attractive option to have," he added.

In a [16 Dec 2021] research note, Mamtani wrote that NVX-CoV2373 is "well-suited for COVID's likely evolution into a relatively benign flu-like paradigm," adding that prior NEJM publications included datasets clinically validating that the Novavax platform "maintain[ed] high efficacy despite antigenic drifts, including via the adjuvant-specific effect."

"We view tolerability profile of a vaccine candidate to be a key consideration for use in a post-pandemic environment, where [Novavax] continues to stand out as the least reactogenic vaccine," he wrote.

The Novavax vaccine has made significant strides in other countries. On [20 Dec 2021], the company announced that the European Commission had granted the vaccine conditional marketing authorization in people 18 and older. They noted that it had recently received an EUA in Indonesia and the Philippines, where it will be commercialized under the trade name Covovax. Covovax also received an emergency use listing from the WHO. One day later, Novavax said it had initiated a booster study.

The vaccine's extended stability and simple storage requirements of up to 6 months at refrigerator temperatures make it "well suited for global deployment," according to the authors of the NEJM study.

"The efficacy of NVX-CoV2373 in preventing moderate-to-severe COVID-19 as well as any symptomatic COVID-19 in people at high risk for acquisition and complications of COVID-19 will make this vaccine a valuable tool in controlling the pandemic and its most serious health and economic consequences," they wrote.

Even with the trial's promising results, the question remains as to whether the Novavax vaccine will reach more of the vaccine hesitant in the U.S.

[4] France: vaccine pass
Date: Mon 3 Jan 2022
Source: Euronews [edited]
https://www.euronews.com/2022/01/03/french-parliament-debates-covid-vaccine-pass-amid-mp-death-threats


Dozens of French MPs say they have received death threats ahead of a debate on the country's latest COVID-19 restrictions.

Lawmakers in France are set to vote on whether to make vaccination pass mandatory for citizens to enter various public spaces. Under proposed new rules, citizens will not be allowed to show a negative test result to enter bars, restaurants, or use long-distance public transport.

The current health pass will be replaced by a so-called "vaccine pass," except where citizens have a "compelling family or health reason" not to be vaccinated.

The legislation is expected to be approved in a vote in the French parliament by [Tue 4 Jan 2022].

But the proposed tightening of restrictions has generated fresh anger from anti-vaccine protestors in France. Several MPs in the ruling En Marche! (LREM) party of President Emmanuel Macron have reported recent threats of violence.

Last week, the property of another French MP in Oise was set on fire and vandalised by suspected anti-vaccine demonstrators. LREM's Barbara Bessot Ballot said at least 52 MPs had received "unacceptable" threats. "We will not yield"

On [Sun 2 Jan 2021], Agnès Firmin Le Bodo of the centre-right Agir party tweeted a graphic threat that had been emailed to her anonymously. In the email, Firmin Le Bodo was threatened with decapitation by someone who said they had bought knives.

Another MP, Naïma Moutchou of the Horizons party, shared a similar threat which said she would be "shot in your home and have your head cut off".

In response to the death threats, French Health Minister Olivier Véran denounced the "selfishness" of anti-vaccine protestors and pledged that those responsible for the threats would be punished. On [Mon 3 Jan 2022], Véran also expressed his "unwavering support for elected officials" before the debate.

Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin has added that police will strengthen protections for elected lawmakers.

"We will not yield," LREM lawmaker Yaël Braun-Pivet told parliament on [Mon 3 Jan 2022], adding that France's democracy "is at stake".

Like many European countries, France has seen demonstrations against coronavirus restrictions in recent months despite improving attitudes. France currently has one the highest COVID-19 vaccination rates in the European Union with more than 91% of citizens aged 12 and over fully vaccinated.

Since August [2021], French citizens have had to show either proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test at many public venues.

But the new "vaccine pass" is being introduced to curb a wave of infections linked to the highly contagious omicron variant. The government says the new regulations will prevent France from having to introduce future curfews or lockdowns. A negative test will still be sufficient to access French health facilities and services.

Those found possessing a fake vaccine pass would face a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment and a 75 000 Euro fine. Bars and restaurants could also be fined 1000 Euro for failing to check customers' vaccine status.

In a tense debate in parliament, several opposition MPs have expressed their opposition to the new rules, with left-wing lawmaker Jean-Luc Melenchon saying the proposed law would create a "totalitarian, authoritarian society". Others have suggested that France should focus on other "weapons" to fight the virus -- such as FFP2 masks and COVID-19 tests -- or introduce measures only for those at risk from infection. A protest was also held outside the French parliament building in Paris on [Mon 3 Jan 2022] evening.

If passed as expected, the proposed bill will then go to the French Senate this week before it can be adopted and enter into force by mid-January [2022].

[The proposed new ruling calling for a vaccine pass is a good idea, except that "Under proposed new rules, citizens will not be allowed to show a negative test result to enter bars, restaurants, or use long-distance public transport." Since a large number of vaccinated individuals are becoming infected with omicron, they might be able to transmit virus even with having been vaccinated and boosted. Thus, the negative test conducted within 24 hrs of entry to a venue seems like a better deterrent to further virus transmission.

Regardless, the threats against public officials, should be punishable. It is totally unacceptable. - Mod.LK]

[For those who wish to see the detailed global data, a snapshot of the Worldometer table at the time we accessed it is available at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/2022%20WORLDDATA%20JAN3_1641317586.pdf.

A 7-day series of cumulative data reported by countries, territories, and reporting entities can be found at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/2022%20JAN3WORLD7_1641317404.pdf.

In the past 24 hours, 22 countries including the USA (933 333), Spain (372 766), the UK (187 414), Italy (68 034), France (67 461), Switzerland (57 489), Canada (48 032), Australia (46 464), India (37 379), Turkey (44 869), Argentina (44 396), Ireland (34 057), Belgium (27 941), Greece (36 246), Germany (26 345), Russia (16 343), Finland (17 047), Vietnam (15 936), The Netherlands (14 536), Brazil (11 850), Bolivia (11 281), and Portugal (10 554), reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 5454 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 1 Jan 2022 to late 2 Jan 2022). The exponential rise in cases over the last couple of weeks can be attributed to the rapid increase in the omicron variant cases in over 90 countries. Studies suggest that the omicron variant causes milder disease than the previously dominant delta variant, but the high number of cases caused by this highly infectious/transmissible variant could rapidly overwhelm hospitals and health systems.

The major differences seen on account of daily fluctuations in testing rates can be misleading, and therefore the rolling 7 day averages is a more precise indicator to follow the trends of the pandemic, which indicates an increasing global trend on cases with some reduction in deaths.

A total of 70 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 42 of the 70 countries are from the European region, 8 are from the Americas region, 5 are from the Western Pacific region, 3 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 3 from the South East Asia region, and 9 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 106.7%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 4.6%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 109.4% increase in daily reported cases and an 8.2% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 2 250 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 292.93 million cumulative reported cases and over 5.46 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA
