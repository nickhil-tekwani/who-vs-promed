The Ministry of Health has reported an outbreak of measles in the
area of the municipality of Jumilla (Murcia), with 65 cases since
late last February [2010]; most of them, with 4 exceptions, involved
citizens of Bulgarian and Romanian origin with a history of
deficiencies in vaccination, according to the Director General of
Public Health, Francisco Jose Garcia.

The 1st cases date back to the last week of February [2010], when
there were 2 isolated outbreaks, one in a family of Romanian origin
living in the municipality of Bullas whose children were not
vaccinated. In total, 2 members had the disease but were isolated
until recovery by medical personnel of the Health Ministry in
collaboration with city officials.

The other outbreak, which had its origin in Jumilla also in the last
week of February 2010, was regarded as "more important," with 65
cases accumulating to date. Among the 65 cases recorded, Garcia
stressed that "the majority are Bulgarians, except for a local nurse
and 3 other adults."

However, Garcia indicted that there had been "a large decrease in the
number of cases in the past 3 weeks such that in the penultimate
week, 16 cases were recorded, and subsequently only 2 more cases have
been identified. So "the outbreak appears to have been brought under
control, although at this point one cannot be certain."

These cases of measles are a matter of concern for the regional
administration, since the disease had been virtually eradicated in
the Autonomous Community and had not been recorded in recent years
except for a single case of a citizen of North Africa from Andalusia
in 2001 whose infection did not spread. Garcia explained that measles
is a virus that spreads "easily" by airborne routes and by direct
person to person contact via the respiratory tract and conjunctiva.

The disease symptoms are mild fever or high fever, sneezing, a
catarrhal process that spreads through the air, and the appearance of
a skin rash spread over his face, chest and arms, with a slight
redness, although Garcia stated that the disease and the problems
caused by it disappear "in a matter of 6-7 days. He stressed that
measles is a "banal" disease but one which can have complications,
for example in immunocompromised individuals.

Following the outbreak, the Ministry of Health announced revised
objectives to protect children with MMR vaccine, which usually is
administered in the Region of Murcia at 15 months and the 2nd dose at
6 years. Now the Ministry has decided to advance the 1st vaccinations
to children across the region such that MMR will be administered to
those who are aged between 6 and 14 months. In addition, the 2nd dose
will be given 4 weeks from receiving the 1st dose.

To warn the public, the Ministry has sent letters to all health
officials, vaccination boards and mayors of municipalities and those
responsible for occupational health authorities. In addition, the
Ministry has reviewed the cases of all children in the vaccination
records of the Murcia Health Service to identify those with any
deficiency in their immunization schedules. Letters will be sent to
them to advise them to complete their vaccination schedules.

Finally, the Ministry has sought the cooperation of municipalities to
identify and locate people "who are not vaccinated and are a
reservoir to transmit these diseases." The goal, according to Garcia,
is to ensure universal vaccination.

[This outbreak follows a familiar pattern in Europe of revelation of
inadequacies in vaccine coverage through the introduction of virus by
migrants from less well-protected regions.
