Mozambique fishing ban
--------------------
The Mozambican government has imposed a three-month ban on fishing off
the coast of northern Cabo Delgado province following the deaths of
at least 150 people from suspected poisoning.
The authorities are investigating the contamination, which reports have
blamed on fishermen dumping pesticides into the water to increase their
catch.
[I would think enormous quantities of pesticide would be needed to kill
fish quickly in the open ocean. A more likely explanation for the
pesticide in the fish follows - Mod.JW

Food poisoning in northern Mozambique
-------------------------------------
There have recently been reports of a small number of deaths and a
larger number of cases of diarrhoea (with and without vomiting) in
the province of Cabo Delgado. This outbreak has been attributed to
the consumption of fish contaminated with pesticides, but little
scientific data are available to substantiate these claims.
Concurrently, there are outbreaks of both cholera and dysentery in
the country and local health services have difficulty differentiating
between symptoms of chemical poisoning and illness caused by
microbial pathogens. Approximately 100 deaths have occurred and about
600 cases of illness have been reported by the provincial health
authorities, but attributing these to either chemical or
microbiological contamination of food or water consumed is not
possible because of lack of reliable scientific data.
According to local health authorities in Cabo Delgado, there have
been 2 deaths since 24 Nov 1998, and the outbreak is under control.
Data from the Ministry of Health suggest that most of the cases of
diarrhoea reported in Cabo Delgado province have been associated with
cholera and dysentery, rather than with pesticide poisoning. Thus
caution is advised in the absence of reliable epidemiological data.
It would appear that the "toxic event" associated with pesticide
poisoning has passed its peak. The consumption of dried fish may be a
possible route of exposure to toxic levels of pesticides, as the use
of non-food-grade pesticides has been frequently reported in
different parts of the world as a method for reducing insect spoilage
of dried fish. The fisheries services in Mozambique are taking the
appropriate prevention and control measures, and are collecting
samples to be forwarded to an international reference laboratory for
analysis. WHO has assembled a multidisciplinary advisory team in
consultation with the national government agencies concerned and FAO.

[The number of notified cases of cholera in the northern Mozambican
province of Nampula, on the border with Cabo Delgado, had risen from
480 to 604 [elsewhere 640 with 37 deaths up to Tuesday, according to
the Beira-based daily Diario de Mozambique, since the outbreak of the
disease in Nampula in November. In Namapa district, the local
authorities have seized 10 tonnes of dried fish, in an attempt to
curb the epidemic.
Namapa district is in the NE of Nampula Province and on the Cabo
Delgado border. The main North/South eastern highway #106, later
#243, passes through it. There is obviously a confusion of
information about the situation in Mozambique, quite apart from what
must a most difficult situation locally - Mod.MHJ
