The Ministry of Emergencies of Kazakhstan has reported that a 2nd
patient has died from anthrax in the Pavlodar oblast of Kazakhstan.
This patient was a woman who died on 21 June 2010.

The cause of the anthrax outbreak was slaughtering of a sick bull and
distribution of the beef to the residents of Karakol and Rebrovka
villages. The man who slaughtered the bull felt sick already on 11
June 2010. He did not apply for medical help and tried self
treatment. He was later transported to the hospital 19 June in a bad
condition and died next day.

Sometime later several other patients were also hospitalized,
including the woman who died recently. A total of 5 more patients
with confirmed anthrax are still in the hospital. There are about 80
contact persons in 2 villages and all are receiving preventive antibiotics.

The sanitary services confiscated and destroyed several kilograms of
contaminated beef.
