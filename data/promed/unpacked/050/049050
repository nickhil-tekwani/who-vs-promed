A case of chikungunya has been identified in Ducos: a 40-year-old woman living in Saint Christophe.

Health authorities are not looking forward to the return of the heat; _Aedes aegypti_ proves, once again, with this new case that the insect can now get through the cool season with no problem to return to power at the beginning of the summer.

More than ever, caution should be exercised and the public is reminded, once again, of the same instructions: destroy all potential breeding sites around the home and continue to protect themselves with repellents.

Chikungunya [virus], it was thought, had temporarily disappeared from New Caledonia, but the [case] of this woman living in Noumea Ducos shows otherwise.

[In April 2013, 3 cases of chikungunya virus infections were reported on New Caledonia (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20130430.1681533). Usually, ProMED-mail would not report of a single case of chikungunua virus infection such as the one above. In this instance, however, the report is of interest because transmission obviously continued through the cool season and it would not be surprising for more cases, perhaps an outbreak, to appear as the hot season begins.

A chikungunya outbreak was 1st detected in Papua New Guinea in June 2012 in Vanimo. Since then, cases spread to East New Britain province, New Ireland, Morobe, Eastern Highlands, West New Britain, Madang, Chimbu, National Capital District, Jiwaka and Manus provinces. It is also suspected to have occurred in Oro and Southern Highlands provinces, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

The WHO has announced that it is working with the Government of Papua New Guinea and other stakeholders to control an outbreak of chikungunya [virus infection] in the Pacific country.

"We must do more to put chikungunya [virus] back in its box," says WHO Representative in Papua New Guinea Dr William Adu-Krow. "It's bad enough that the country already struggles with isolated cases of dengue. The presence of another mosquito-borne viral disease is putting the welfare of many others at grave risk."

WHO has supported the Papua New Guinea National Department of Health to develop and distribute fact sheets and other health materials about chikungunya and dengue, advising the public on appropriate care, on reducing the risk of mosquito bites and on eliminating mosquito breeding sites.

It has also assisted health authorities to develop clinical management guidelines for distribution to all provinces.

WHO has funded an entomology study in Vanimo, the capital of Sandaun province, to determine which species of mosquito -- _Aedes aegypti_ or _Aedes albopictus_ -- is involved in the outbreak. WHO developed a diagnostic protocol for suspected chikungunya and dengue cases and procured dengue rapid tests.

A WHO epidemiologist and a technical officer have provided clinical management seminars in a variety of clinical settings and have appeared on radio and television to promote awareness of chikungunya and dengue.

The first 2 cases in the capital of Port Moresby were confirmed on 17 Apr 2013 by the Papua New Guinea Institute of Medical Research. Since then, hundreds of suspected cases have been detected in the Port Moresby area.

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, chikungunya fever is a viral disease transmitted to humans by the bite of infected mosquitoes.

Chikungunya fever is diagnosed based on symptoms, physical findings (e.g., joint swelling), laboratory testing, and the possibility of exposure to infected mosquitoes.

There is no specific treatment for chikungunya fever; care is based on symptoms. Chikungunya fever is not usually fatal [seldom, if ever, fatal].

Steps to prevent infection with chikungunya virus include use of insect repellent, protective clothing, and staying in areas with screens.

Chikungunya virus was 1st isolated from the blood of a febrile patient in Tanzania in 1953, and has since been cited as the cause of numerous human epidemics in many areas of Africa and Asia and most recently in limited areas of Europe.

[There have been scattered cases of chikungunya virus infection in Papua New Guinea this year (2013). A few individuals who were infected there became ill in Australia, illustrating the risk of long-distance spread from these foci.

The regional Department of Health reported 902 patients were admitted to various hospitals in the Cordillera [region] due to suspected chikungunya although no cases of death were recorded since the start of the year [2013].

Records from the DOH Regional Epidemiology Surveillance Unit show that from the 902 cases, the health agency was able to send 151 blood specimens to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine and only 44 were confirmed positive for chikungunya [virus infection].

From the confirmed cases, Ifugao topped with 18, followed by Mountain Province with 10, Kalinga and Apayao with 6 each, while 2 cases were from Baguio.

One confirmed case was recorded in Abra, while the remaining case is a patient from outside the region.

The World Health Organization defines chikungunya fever as a viral illness transmitted through the bite of infected _Aedes_ mosquitoes. As it usually co-occurs with and resembles dengue, the chikungunya fever is often misdiagnosed.

DOH-RESU reported that the ages of people who showed signs and symptoms of chikungunya range from 3 months old to 92 years old with 25 as the median age.

The most common signs and symptoms of the recorded cases are fever, rashes, arthralgia [joint pain], arthritis, myalgia [muscle pain], headache, back pain, red eyes, cough, and coryza [cold symptoms].

DOH earlier declared an outbreak of chikungunya fever cases, which is caused by dengue-carrying mosquitoes, in Lamut, Ifugao after more than 500 persons contracted the illness.

DOH Officer-in-charge Veleriano Lopez said the regional health agency together with the various provincial health offices have been facilitating the sending of blood samples to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine for confirmation.

DOH is also encouraging the conduct of active case detection and prompt reporting of cases while providing assistance to local government units with reported cases of chikungunya.

The agency, through its RESU personnel, also oriented representatives of municipal health offices and public health nurses about the illness.

Concerned LGUs are also being asked to implement anti-dengue drive like the 4 o'clock habit and promote clean surroundings.

[There have been chikungunya virus outbreaks in various parts of the Philippines this year (2013). This outbreak in the Cordillera region is one of the larger ones. But with only 44 of 151 samples testing positive for chikungunya virus infection, one wonders what the etiologies of the discarded cases might have been (perhaps dengue virus infections in some instances).
