1st report of a begomovirus associated with leaf curl disease of bell
pepper in Pakistan
M. Tahir <tahirsbs@yahoo.com> and M.S. Haider, School of Biological
Sciences, University of the Punjab, Quaid-i-Azam Campus, Lahore,
Pakistan Accepted for publication 18 Oct 2005.
Bell pepper (_Capsicum annuum_ var. _grossum_; family _Solanaceae_)
is a vegetable commonly cultivated in most of the vegetable growing
areas of Pakistan. Leaf samples from 3 bell pepper plants showing
leaf curl symptoms and from 2 apparently healthy (symptomless) plants
were collected during a recent survey for begomoviruses, from the
vegetable fields around the Lahore city. Overall disease incidence
was 60-70 percent with severe leaf curl symptoms.
DNA was extracted from both types of samples. The presence of a
begomovirus was confirmed by PCR amplification using a degenerate
primer pair, designed to conserved regions of the coat protein genes
from published sequences of begomoviruses from the Old World (Haider
et al., 2005; virion-sense primer 5' ATG(C/A/T)(G/C)
(G/C/A)AAGCG(A/T)(C/A)C(A/C)G(G/C)(A/C) GATAT-3'; complementary-sense
primer 5' TTAATT (T/G/C)(C/G/A)(A/T/C)(A/T/G) A(C/T)
(A/T/C)(G/C)(C/A/T)(A/G)TCATA(G/A)AA(A/G)TA-3').
An amplification product of the expected size for the coat protein
gene (approx. 750 bp) was produced from symptomatic samples but there
was no amplification from the symptomless plants. The PCR product was
cloned and sequenced. The sequences obtained from bell pepper
(Accession No. AM051090) showed the highest levels of sequence
identity to Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus - [Pakistan:_Solanum_]
(syn. Solanum yellow leaf curl virus) segment A (84 percent over a
stretch of 656 nucleotides, Accession number AJ620187). Since the
coat protein gene is the most conserved gene among
whitefly-transmitted geminiviruses (Padidam et al., 1995), it is
predicted that overall homology for the complete genome may be even
less than 84 percent.
These findings indicate that the virus of bell pepper is a new
species of begomovirus for which we suggest the name Bell pepper leaf
curl virus (BPLCV).
Recent reports have shown that many begomoviruses of the Old World
are associated with a single-stranded DNA satellite (DNA beta;
Briddon et al., 2003). Attempts to identify the presence of a DNA
beta in the infected _Capsicum annuum_ var. _grossum_ samples, using
universal DNA beta primers (Briddon et al., 2002) produced a ca.
1.4-kb product, corresponding to that expected for a full-length
amplicon from a satellite. This has not been sequenced but probably
indicates that BPCLV is associated with a DNA satellite.
To the best of our knowledge this the 1st report of a begomovirus
associated with leaf curl disease of _Capsicum annuum_ var. _grossum_.

[This report demonstrates that begomoviruses are continually evolving
in Asia, especially in India and Pakistan. The combination of high
temperatures, presence of high populations of whiteflies, and
suitable natural host plants apparently results in a mix that is
conducive to generating new begomovirus strains in the region. The
begomovirus-beta satellite complexes referred to above are associated
with economically important diseases and have been isolated from
vegetable and fiber crops, ornamental plants, and weeds throughout
Africa and Asia. Their widespread distribution and diversity, coupled
to the global movement of plant material and the dissemination of the
whitefly vector, suggests that these disease complexes pose a serious
threat to tropical and sub-tropical agro-ecosystems worldwide.
Collaborative work which is described in the 2nd link below,
involving research scientists at the Plant Biotechnology Division,
National Institute for Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering (NIBGE),
PO Box 577, Jhang Road, Faisalabad, Pakistan and the Department of
Disease and Stress Biology, John Innes Centre, Colney, Norwich, UK
NR4 7UH, contains information suggesting that these disease complexes
are rapidly expanding in geographical distribution and host range. As
an example, cotton leaf curl disease, originally a major problem in
central Pakistan, is now causing extensive damage in India. In the
same region, new diseases are emerging in crops such as tomato,
tobacco, chillies and papaya. The presence of such a diverse
population of begomoviruses in a single region, coupled with the
propensity of these viruses to exchange genetic material by
recombination [35,37-39], increases the probability of new virus
diseases emerging in the region.
These viruses will likely cause epidemics in previously unaffected
crops, a problem that will be exacerbated by the selective use of
elite cultivars, movement of infected plant material and widespread
introduction of the whitefly vector (_Bemisia tabaci_). Continued
growth in international trade and travel could result in these
whitefly-transmissible disease complexes reaching the New World, as
was demonstrated when Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV-Is)
appeared in the eastern Caribbean in Cuba, the Dominican Republic,
and Jamaica. In the case of the Dominican Republic, it was believed
to have been introduced on infected but asymptomatic tomato
transplants from the eastern Mediterranean region. An isolate of
TYLCV-Is from the Dominican Republic and 98 percent identical to an
isolate from Israel appeared to have entered the United States in
Dade County, Florida, in late 1996 or early 1997. Subsequently,
infected tomato transplants produced for retail sale at 2 Dade County
facilities were rapidly distributed via retail garden centers
throughout the state.
