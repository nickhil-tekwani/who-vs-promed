[1] Norovirus, Las Vegas hotel - USA (Nevada)

Norovirus confirmed as cause of outbreak of illness at Flamingo Hotel
-----------------------------------------------
Eyewitness News has learned that the illness that has plagued the Flamingo
hotel and casino is due to norovirus infection. We were the first to tell
you about the spreading illness at the hotel. And today, Tue 26 Oct 2004,
the health district told us that they've had as many as 250 unconfirmed
cases of norovirus infection; most were Flamingo employees, and some were
guests. The Flamingo says they will fog all the 3500 rooms in the hotel
with an anti-viral chemical. They will also leave a letter in each room
telling new guests about the situation.
Norovirus is spread by humans, after being picked up by fecal-oral contact.
Washing hands after using the restroom is a critical preventive measure.
The hotel is aggressively cleaning the property and is using foggers to
spray a sanitizer in the air to penetrate hard-to-clean surfaces.
On Monday [25 Oct 2004] evening, the Clark County Health District said
norovirus infection may be what has caused dozens of people at the Flamingo
hotel to get sick. The health district is waiting for official lab results.
But, everything so far is pointing to norovirus infection. A source within
the Flamingo hotel told Eyewitness News that more than 100 people have
reported not feeling well. They are still busy sanitizing the casino and
the hotel. Noroviruses can live on surfaces for several weeks.
On the morning of Mon 25 Oct 2004, health officials stated that they may
have identified what caused dozens of people to fall ill at the Flamingo
hotel last week. A spokesman for the health district says it is operating
under the hypothesis that it is due to norovirus infection. Everything
right now is pointing in that direction.
Over the weekend, Eyewitness News visited the Harmon Medical Center, where
dozens of employees and guests have been going in search of relief. The
Flamingo says it is sanitizing slot machines, bathrooms, employee areas,
and guest rooms. In fact, Flamingo officials say they were overly cautious
even before the health district got involved. They also have been notifying
guests of the situation as soon as they check in.
A spokesman for the health district stated that this was not an outbreak of
influenza. Again, they say everything is pointing in the direction of
norovirus infection. The best thing you can do is wash your hands. The
norovirus can live on a surface for up to 4 weeks. The Flamingo is telling
employees or guests who show symptoms of the illness to go to the Harmon
Medical Clinic for testing and treatment.
This is similar to another incident at a downtown casino. In March 2004,
more than 1500 people who either stayed at, or visited, the California
hotel-casino downtown became ill with norovirus.

[Fogging with "an anti-viral chemical" is a novel approach to
decontamination in the aftermath of a norovirus outbreak. Removal of the
unidentified anti-viral chemical could be a greater problem than removal of
the infectious agent itself, depending on the nature of the chemical.
Fogging is a procedure usually associated with control of arboviral
infection by destruction of insect vectors. Noroviruses are transmitted by
the fecal-oral route, not by arthropods. - Mod.CP]

Russia: outbreak of "acute viral gastroenteritis" in Tyumen (Siberia)
-----------------------------------------------
An outbreak of an enteric infection has been recorded in Tyumen. A total of
31 persons, including 15 children, with a diagnosis of acute virus
gastroenteritis, have been admitted to the hospital. This information has
been released by the public health services and medical insurance
administration of the city of Tyumen.
Symptoms of enteric infection have been reported for [another] 80 persons.
Preliminary data suggest that the people who are falling ill are using
water from a [particular] aqueduct. However, results of an investigation at
the aqueduct, carried out by epidemiologists, have not revealed any
inadequacies in sanitary control procedures. However, physicians are
strongly recommending the boiling of all water used for drinking.
The Chief Health Officer of the city of Tyumen has arranged an emergency
meeting of epidemiologists to review the situation.

[The lack of detail in the report does not reveal the basis for the "virus"
diagnosis, nor the suspected agent. Many enteric agents could be
responsible for a water-borne infection. Further information would be
appreciated. - Mod.CP]
