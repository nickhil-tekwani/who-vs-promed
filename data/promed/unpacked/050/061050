Measles death fears in outbreak
-------------------------------
Parents in Wales are again warned to make sure their children have the MMR
[measles, mumps, rubella] jab as the number of cases tops 200. Health
chiefs fear one of the biggest measles outbreaks in Wales will become fatal
after figures showed 207 people are suffering from the virus. Several
people have been treated in intensive care units after the worst outbreak
of the disease in years.

The National Public Health Service (NPHS) is urging parents to ensure their
children are vaccinated. Dr Marion Lyons of the NPHS said: "Any child who
is overdue for vaccination is at risk."

The mid and west Wales areas have seen 147 cases, with 23 people admitted
to hospital. 89 of the cases in mid and west Wales are linked to 4
outbreaks in south Pembrokeshire, Llanelli, Burry Port, and Neath Port
Talbot areas, while the others are sporadic cases across 7 county areas.

In Llandudno, there are 53 cases with 2 people taken to hospital, linked to
outbreaks in 2 schools, Ysgol Ffordd Dyffryn and Ysgol John Bright. 5 of
the 7 cases in south east Wales have family links to the cases in mid and
west Wales while the others are sporadic.

Dr Marion Lyons, head of the health protection teams for the NPHS, said:
"For as long as there are children who do not receive their MMR
vaccinations, there is the potential for people to become ill with measles.
With so many cases in the community, any child who is overdue for
vaccination is at risk and we are urging parents who have still not
arranged immunisation for their children to act immediately."

"MMR is a safe vaccine that protects children from the most severe viral
rash illness of childhood. There is strong evidence that worldwide, as many
as one in 500 children who catch measles will die, and another one in 500
will suffer permanent brain damage. With 26 people now admitted to hospital
because of these measles outbreaks -- some of them having spent time in
intensive care units -- we fear it is only a matter of time before someone
dies or is left permanently affected by measles. The people most at risk of
catching measles are children of school age or children between the ages of
one and 4 who are not up-to-date with their vaccinations." "Although we are
seeing cases of measles in adults, it is rare for anyone born before 1970
to catch measles."

The NPHS said many people who catch measles will have a fever, cough, red
eyes, and blocked nose and feel generally unwell. The blotchy rash appears
a few days later beginning on the face and spreading downwards to the rest
of the body over several days. Typically, the organisation added, people
will be infectious from the day before their 1st symptoms until 4 to 5 days
after the appearance of the rash. Dr Lyons explained: "If your child is
unwell and you suspect it is measles, you should contact your GP. Your
child should not attend school or nursery for 5 days after the rash starts.
"After completing a 2-dose course of the MMR vaccine -- which also offers
protection against mumps and rubella -- 99 per cent of children will be
protected against measles."

[This is proving to be an extensive and protracted outbreak with a large
number of hospital admissions. It remains to be seen whether the warning of
potential fatalities will have any positive effect on the uptake of MMR
vaccine.
