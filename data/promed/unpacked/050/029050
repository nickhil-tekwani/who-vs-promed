[Mumps] has suddenly sprung up in the United States, and authorities are trying to figure out how to get a handle on the situation.

A very unpleasant disease [mumps] has reared its ugly head in the United States, and authorities have been trying to understand why it's happening and how to stop it. Health department officials in Texas have announced that cases of mumps have surged to a 20-year high, and there may have been a bunch of exposures on South Padre Island where spring-breakers are celebrating.

State health officials have reported 221 cases of mumps so far this year [2017], the most since 1994 when there were 234 cases. Mumps results in swollen salivary grands, swollen testicles, low fever, tiredness, and muscle aches, with symptoms emerging about 16 -- 18 days after exposure.

Infections of mumps dived 99 percent since a vaccine was developed and released in 1967. The mumps vaccine protects 88 percent of people who are fully vaccinated, although some vaccinated people can still get sick if exposed.

"The Texas Department of State Health Services is advising health care providers to be on alert for mumps in their patients as the state experiences a 20-year high in mumps cases," states the THHS website "State, regional and local health departments are currently investigating multiple outbreaks throughout the state, including one involving possible exposures on South Padre Island, a popular spring break destination for students from Texas and elsewhere in the United States. Texas has had 221 mumps cases this year [2017], the largest total since there were 234 cases in 1994."

Cedar Hill ISD officials held a forum [Wed 19 Apr 2017] night to provide more information to concerned parents about a severe mumps outbreak.

Dallas County Health and Human Services reports 84 mumps cases so far in 2017 [see [1] above, 221 cases total in state].

Up to 64 of those cases are students and teachers in Cedar Hill ISD, with 3 more cases in DeSoto. Health officials have also identified 17 unrelated cases in Mesquite, Dallas and DeSoto.

Parents at the meeting submitted questions. Many wanted to know how the mumps is spreading and why.

"You heard about the chicken pox, you heard about the meningitis, but the mumps you haven't heard about in so long, so you're kind of concerned, like can it cause death?" said parent [SA].

[A] has a daughter at Cedar Hill High School. Her child is vaccinated, but [A] is still concerned about the mumps outbreak that started at her child's school.

"What are we doing about this mumps outbreak? Are we cleaning the building?" [A] asked.

District officials said the outbreak started at Cedar Hill High School in February [2017].

Since then, more cases have been found at 9th Grade Center, Collegiate High School, Permenter Middle School and High Pointe Elementary. "When you get a bunch of kids all contained in small pockets of areas, like schools, the likelihood of spreading an airborne virus is gonna happen," said Cedar Hill ISD superintendent Orlando Riddick.

Officials don't know the source but said they're doing their best to keep the situation under control.

"We've started our cleaning processes and cleaning high touch areas," superintendent Riddick said. "We began to disinfect schools with a misting machine."

The district has also hosted 4 vaccine booster clinics, saying more than 90 percent of their students are vaccinated.

The district's health director, Dr Michael Marshall, said infected people could be unknowingly spreading mumps.

"The problem is simply that people are coming to school who are infected with the mumps and they don't know it," said Dr Marshall.

According to doctors, it can take up to 25 days until symptoms like fever, headache and loss of appetite show up. Some who are infected have no symptoms.

Parent [AG] said the district should be transparent about the outbreak. "Just be transparent and make sure our building is clean and that it's safe for our children and teachers,"[G] said.

According to health officials, those without the mumps vaccine are most at risk. Doctors recommend at least 2 vaccines, and even a 3rd booster shot to increase protection. However, one can still get mumps even with the proper vaccines.

University of Minnesota health officials are warning students about a mumps outbreak on campus, CBS Minnesota reports.

So far there have been 6 reported cases, campus health officials say.

It's considered highly contagious and the disease is spread by coughing, sneezing or sharing items that you eat or drink.

The symptoms are pretty clear -- puffy cheeks, a swollen jaw accompanied by a fever, headaches and loss of appetite.

"I've been at Boynton Health for 20 years and we have not had this situation before," said Dr Gary Christenson, the chief medical officer at the University of Minnesota.

Christenson said students are required to be vaccinated for mumps before they come to school, with a few exceptions. But even then, it's still possible to contract the disease.

Up to 6 reported cases of mumps so far at the University may not seem like a large number. But on a campus like this, Christenson said anything over 3 cases is considered an outbreak.

"One of the challenges of mumps is that for the 1st 2 days that someone has it, before they have symptoms, they are already shedding or can be exposing other people to it," said Christenson.

A couple years ago, the Minnesota Wild got caught in a mumps outbreak. And in February, the mumps again briefly sidelined forwards [ZP] and [JP]. Students believe that if it can spread quickly on a hockey team, it can spread just as quickly on campus.

"If you are at the library or something, this is such a huge school, it's so hard for things not to be spread around," said senior Maddie Trenholm.

That's why health officials are asking students or faculty who has been diagnosed to stay away for 5 days.

"It's really hard to predict how long this will be an issue and how many cases we might have," said Christenson.

And with finals coming up, they are hoping to keep this from spreading as much as possible. The cases the university has seen so far are considered mild.

A US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report in December 2016 shows that mumps are at a 10-year high -- and colleges seem to be especially hard hit by the contagious virus. The close quarters on campus make it easy for the disease to spread.

[From 1 Jan -- 25 Mar 2017, 42 states and the District of Columbia in the US reported 1965 cases of mumps to CDC.

From year to year, mumps cases can range from roughly a couple hundred to a couple thousand. For example in 2016, there were approximately 5748 cases reported to CDC, and in 2012, there were 229. Before the US mumps vaccination program started in 1967, about 186 000 cases were reported each year, but the actual number of cases was likely much higher due to underreporting. Since the pre-vaccine era, there has been more than 99 percent decrease in mumps cases in the United States.
