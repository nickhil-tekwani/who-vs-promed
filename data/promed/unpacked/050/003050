Major Poultry Die Offs From Bird Flu
------------------------------------
Poultry infections from the H5N1 bird flu virus in Indonesia are so
common that they rarely rate notice outside of their local press.

But, as [reported] in a translation this morning of an article from
the Indonesia newspaper 'Tempo Interaktif,' 10 regions of South
Sulawesi are dealing with an unusually large die off of poultry, even
by Indonesian standards.

More than 100 000 birds have died in the past couple of weeks amid
reports of vaccine and disinfectant shortages.

This report is from this morning's Bird Flu Information Corner -- a
joint project between Japan's Kobe University and the Institute of
Tropical Disease, Airlangga University, Indonesia.

"Maros, South Sulawesi: Bird flu widespread in 10 regions Veterinary
Disease Investigation Center, General Directorate of Livestock in
Maros reported 10 regions in South Sulawesi tested positive bird flu
H5N1 infection according to the research conducted from January to
July 2011, said spokesman of Veterinary Disease Investigation Center
in Maros, Affendi.

"Of 2404 birds tested, over 100 were positive bird flu H5N1. The
samples came from Kabupaten (municipality) Bantaeng, Takalar,
Makassar, Palopo, Pinrang and Maros. The virus had also been found in
Kabupaten Konawe, Southeast Sulawesi."

FAO has recently published a mid-year review on Avian Influenza
(2011), which includes the following (edited) information:

A recently-released paper by the Animal Production and Health
Division notes that in at least 6 countries in Asia and Africa (The
People's Republic of China in East Asia, Viet Nam in the Greater
Mekong sub-region, Indonesia in Southeast Asia, Bangladesh and India
in the Indo-Gangetic Plain, and Egypt in North Africa), H5N1 HPAI
remains entrenched, and these countries are considered endemic for the
disease.

In response to these evolving situations, for instance, FAO is
collaborating with the Ministry of Agriculture of Indonesia and
private sector market-traders to initiate a cleaning and disinfection
program for poultry transport vehicles at collector yards. By reducing
viral contamination on empty poultry transport trucks leaving the
collector yard, the risk of virus spread from farm to farm via
collector yard should, in theory, be reduced. FAO has also supported
the local governments in the greater Jakarta area to improve
sanitation and hygiene in live bird markets in and around the city. By
maintaining cleaner market environments where live birds are displayed
to consumers, it is expected that the risk of virus spread to humans
will be reduced.

Also, veterinary epidemiologists at the Emergency and Prevention
Systems (EMPRES) point out that, during the last 3 years, in Southeast
Asia there has been an upward trend in the number of outbreaks of H5N1
HPAI which suggests that rapid disease dynamics are very much part of
the economic, social, and cultural background of the region. In terms
of human cases of H5N1 HPAI, they concur with WHO datasets indicating
that Egypt and Indonesia are disease hotspots.

The latest (monthly) issue of FAOAIDE News includes information on
the most recent H5N1 AI outbreaks 2006 - 2011 (compiled on the basis
of information up to 30 June 2011). Indonesia's most recent reported
status dates back to May 2011 (see at
http://www.fao.org/docrep/014/al869e/al869e00.pdf). - Mod.AS]
