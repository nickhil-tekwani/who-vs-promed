Dropsy victims [have been urged to get heart check-ups. [Insofar as a
majority of the 57 deaths due to epidemic dropsy have occurred due to
involvement of the heart, cardiologists have advised that dropsy-affected
people should get a proper heart check-up done. Meanwhile, there has been a
reduction in dropsy patients being reported to various hospitals. Patients
are now coming with secondary complications of the disease such as glaucoma
and retinal haemorrhages. Over 2,500 people in the Capital have fallen ill
after consuming adulterated mustard oil. Doctors have also recommended that
patients who have returned home after being treated by dropsy should eat a
diet rich in proteins and vitamins.
