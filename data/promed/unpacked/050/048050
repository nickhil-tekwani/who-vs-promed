A rise in insecticide resistant mosquitoes has become the latest
threat to combating malaria in Nigeria, where roughly up to 300 000
people die each year from the killer disease, experts have warned.

Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, contributes more than a
quarter of the one million malaria deaths in Africa, according to
official statistics.

Some 75 million Nigerians, or half of the population, get attacked by
malaria at least once a year, while children below 5 years (around 24
million) get up to 4 bouts each year.

"The problem of insecticide resistance is very real and growing,"
Peter Cleary, communications director of Vestergaard Frandsen,
European-based manufacturers of insecticide-impregnated bednets, said.

Malaria kills up to 300 000 Nigerians each year, according to
official estimates. Around 97 percent of the 150 million Nigerians
are at risk of infection, says Roll Back Malaria, a global initiative
aiming to eradicate the disease.

Major constraints in fighting the endemic disease have been poverty,
ignorance and a dilapidated health infrastructure.

Nigerian scientists, policy makers and foreign experts who met in
Abuja last week highlighted the dangers of mosquito resistance to
insecticides, arising mainly from the heavy use of agro-chemical
pesticides, as another concern.

Although resistance to insecticides is not new, there are signs it is
growing, and it might worsen due to the effects of climate change.

"There is concern that the malarial vectors are becoming resistant to
the entire class of insecticides the WHO (World Health Organisation)
approves," Cleary told AFP.

Mosquitoes evolve over time to adapt to the climatic environment and
against any chemicals used to control them. The most common
insecticide, pyrethroid, is also used to control pests in rice and
cotton farming.

"In cases where there is high resistance of mosquitoes to
insecticides, there is high usage of agricultural pesticides," said
Yayo Abdulsalam, a researcher and lecturer in medical entomology at
Bayero University in Nigeria's northern Kano State.

The trend is becoming more worrying with the unpredictable effects of
climate change.

Abdulsalam said the likely rise in temperatures, the decrease in
rainfall and advance of the Sahara desert are likely to impact on the
distribution of mosquitoes and the intensity of malaria.

Climate change is also likely to induce human behaviour that exposes
people more to mosquito bites.

"Climate change can affect both men and the mosquitoes. If
temperatures get too uncomfortable to sleep indoors, people sleep
outside, and the vectors that used to bite indoors can change habit
and bite outside," Abdulsalam told AFP.

Malaria accounts for about 65 percent of out-patient visits and 30
percent of hospitalisations in Nigeria, says WHO, and takes up around
18 percent of annual household income in treatments.

Resistance is the "1st warning sign that you have to take necessary
measures to ensure that the few insecticides we have ... will be
effective," said Sam Awolola, a scientist with Nigerian Institute of
Medical Research.

Researchers also voiced worry that resistance might worsen due to
access to cheap and inferior bednets.

With a government target to roll out 62 million bednets in Nigeria by
the end of next year [2010], there are fears fake products might
filter into the country, previously notorious for fake pharmaceutical drugs.

"Instead of a net being 100 percent impregnated (with an
insecticide), they may be 50 percent impregnated, and that means the
mosquitoes get half a dosage, survive, and pass the gene to the next
generation, and resistance builds," said Awolola, adding that
"unfortunately, we have a very porous market in Nigeria."

Deji Asa, a Lagos-based behavioural therapist who gets a malaria
attack every year, believes some of the household insecticides
available are no longer effective.

"I change the insecticides regularly, because after a while, some of
them don't seem to kill the mosquitoes anymore," he told AFP.

[Synthetic pyrethroids are the class of insecticides used for
impregnation of bednets, which is the cornerstone of malaria control
in many endemic countries. Increasing resistance against synthetic
pyrethroids have been reported for many years but seems to be
spreading (see, for instance, this report from Cameroon: Nwane P et
al. Trends in DDT and pyrethroid resistance in Anopheles gambiae s.s.
populations from urban and agro-industrial settings in southern
Cameroon. BMC Infect Dis. 2009;9:163). Other studies report no
resistance (Anto F et al. Insecticide resistance profiles for malaria
vectors in the Kassena-Nankana district of Ghana. Malar J. 2009;8:81)
or low level resistance (Betson M et al. Status of insecticide
susceptibility in Anopheles gambiae s.l. from malaria surveillance
sites in The Gambia. Malar J. 2009 Aug 5;8:187).

The study from Cameroon used genotypic susceptibility testing; i.e.
it looked for mutations in genes suspected of being indications of
resistance to pyrethroids. However, as the authors point out,
resistance is probably a multi-locus function, and, therefore,
genotypic resistance testing alone cannot be used as the sole
measurement of resistance to pyrethroids. Methods used in the study
from Nigeria are not known. - Mod.EP]
