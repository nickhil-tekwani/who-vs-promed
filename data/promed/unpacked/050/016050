A 10-year-old child is among people hospitalized with [suspected] anthrax said Aizhan Isa, spokeswoman of the health care department of Karaganda region. "Inhabitants of Shet district aged 23-50 have been taken to the infection hospital since [20 Jun 2016]. Among them is a 10 years old child. They were hospitalized to exclude dangerous infections, including anthrax," she said. She said tests have been made.

"Unfortunately 2 people died, a man and a woman. The man was about 50, the woman 35-40. They were hospitalized [and their condition described as] infectious toxic shock, then they died," she said.

The test results will be ready in 1-2 days.
