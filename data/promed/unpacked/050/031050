Goss's bacterial wilt and blight has been confirmed by the UNL
[University of Nebraska-Lincoln] in samples received from southwest
Nebraska, with more unconfirmed reports in eastern Nebraska. Last year
[2008] was the 1st time the disease was confirmed statewide in
approximately 2 decades. The recent re-emergence of the disease
indicates an increased risk this year [2009] because of the abundance
of bacterial inoculum to have overwintered. In addition, the recent
severe weather that damaged corn crops is also likely to contribute to
[the] disease.

Bacterial stalk rot was identified in corn and sorghum in Seward
County [southeast Nebraska], with several other unconfirmed reports in
south central and southeast Nebraska. This disease may be caused by
one of several common bacterial pathogens that occur in the soil and
can overwinter in crop residue. The disease is often favored by high
temperatures and humidity and also develops in fields that have been
exposed to flooding, which is consistent with recent weather events in
areas of Nebraska.

Holcus spot continues to appear in Nebraska fields. It can appear like
diseases caused by fungi, such as eyespot and gray leaf spot.

Unfortunately, rescue treatments are not currently available for any
of these diseases. Because all of them are caused by bacteria, control
with foliar fungicides is not expected [to work].

[Goss's wilt and blight of maize is caused by the bacterium
_Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _nebraskensis_. It is a persistent
and economically serious disease of susceptible maize hybrids in the
USA. The bacterium can also affect some grasses, which may serve as
pathogen reservoirs. Symptoms include systemic wilting and/or leaf
lesions and blighting. Infection of leaves, stems, and roots occurs
primarily through wounds (mechanical, hail, or insect damage), and
plants are susceptible at all growth stages. The pathogen is seed
transmitted and overwinters on crop debris and maize kernels. Subsp.
_nebraskensis_ has so far not been reported outside the USA, however
other subspecies found elsewhere include _sepedonicus_ (potato ring
rot) and _michiganensis_ (bacterial canker of tomatoes) which cause
severe yield losses on their respective hosts.

Bacterial stalk rot of maize is caused by _Pectobacterium
chrysanthemi_ pathovar _zeae_ (synonym _Erwinia carotovora_ f. sp.
_zeae_) and possibly related species. The pathogen can also affect
millets of the genera _Sorghum_ and _Pennisetum_ and can cause soft
rot in a wide range of vegetable and other crops.

Holcus spot of maize is caused by the bacterium _Pseudomonas syringae_
pv. _syringae_ which is a common epiphyte on both leaves and seeds of
many plants. This pathogen also causes diseases of, for example,
tomato, citrus, mango, and apricot, and seed transmission is suspected
in some hosts. Other pathovars also exist which can affect different
hosts.

Disease management of bacterial diseases may include cultural
practices to minimise inoculum, crop rotation, phytosanitation to
prevent spread, and use of resistant crop varieties.

The fungal diseases of maize mentioned above are eyespot caused by
_Kabatiella zeae_ and grey leaf spot caused by _Cercospora
zeae-maydis_. For more information on these see previous ProMED-mail
posts in the archives.
