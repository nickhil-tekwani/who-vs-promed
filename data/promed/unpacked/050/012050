The Department of Health here has cautioned villagers to be vigilant
against dengue fever amid a reported 6 deaths during the 1st months of
the year [2010]. The reported dengue deaths from January to June this
year is higher than the 5 recorded during the same period in 2009. The
dengue deaths this year were reported in Lasam, Santa Ana and
Claveria, all in Cagayan; in Ilagan in Isabela; Diadi in Nueva Vizcaya
and Maddela in Quirino with one death each. But the reported 336
dengue fever cases for the 1st 6 months of 2010 is lower than the 442
last year [2009].

Not wanting to be complacent, health workers have been deployed to
villages to conduct massive information campaigns on preventing dengue
fever, a flu-like illness spread by _Aedes aegypti_-infected
mosquitoes, said Floro Orata, regional health information officer.

Orata said the dengue carrying mosquito usually bites at dusk and dawn
but may bite at any time during the day, especially indoors, in shady
areas, or when the weather is cloudy. This mosquito prefers to breed
in areas with clean stagnant water, such as flower vases, uncovered
barrels, buckets, discarded tires, wet shower floors and toilet tanks,
he added.

He asked villagers to wear long-sleeved clothing and long trousers
when outdoors during the day and evening, spray permethrin or DEET
repellents on clothing, use mosquito netting over the bed and do
constant cleaning of the environment.

The Department of Health (DOH) said Friday [23 Jul 2010] that the
number of recorded indigenous dengue fever cases has risen to 12,
mostly in the southern city of Kaohsiung. Chou Chih-hao, Deputy
Director-General of the DOH's Centers for Disease Control, said that
among the 12 cases, 11 were reported from the city's Gushan District,
while the most recent was found in Kaohsiung County's Fongshan City.
The latest patient is a 12-year-old boy who started displaying
symptoms 12 Jul [2010] and was confirmed as the 12th indigenous dengue
fever case on 20 Jul [2010].

The DOH warned the public to take precautions against dengue fever, as
the disease is entering its peak season. Because no vaccine exists for
the disease, the DOH said the most effective measure that can be taken
is to eliminate potential breeding grounds for the mosquitoes by
cleaning up containers of standing water.

The national capital reported the 1st dengue death of the season with
a child succumbing to the disease at the AIIMS [All India Institute of
Medical Sciences] , even as civic authorities expressed concern over
detection of mosquito breeding in various offices and Commonwealth
Games venues. "An 8-year-old dengue patient died yesterday [22 Jul
2010] at AIIMS. He resides in Okhla area of Delhi but had contracted
the virus from Bihar, where he had gone on a vacation with his
family," Municipal Health Officer N K Yadav said.

The city has reported 26 cases of the disease, he said. The Municipal
Corporation of Delhi [MCD] has expressed concern over detection of
mosquito breeding in different offices and sports venues including
Games Village, MTNL Exchange [Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd.] in Hauz
Khas, G B Pant Hospital, DMRC Project [Delhi Metro Rail Corporation
Ltd.] in Saket, IG Stadium and R K Khanna Stadium.

"Since dengue is a viral illness with cyclical trend of increase in
cases after every 3-4 years, which coincides with Commonwealth Games
this year [2010], there is an urgent need to take adequate precautions
against dengue," Municipal Commissioner K S Mehra has said.

According to official data, a total of 11 dengue cases have been
reported from MCD areas, 6 from NDMC areas, and another 6 had been
from outside the state. "The address of the remaining 3 is yet to be
ascertained," Yadav said.

The MCD has engaged a total of 3500 domestic [dengue virus vector
mosquito] breeding checkers from April this year [2010].

The Epidemiology Unit of the Health Ministry states that the outbreak
of dengue fever has caused 164 deaths, while 22 159 cases have been
reported so far this year [2010]. The Unit reported that the highest
number of deaths of 45 had been reported from the Colombo district,
followed by Gampaha district with 21 deaths and Jaffna district with
16 deaths.

Out of the 45 from Colombo district, 20 were reported from the Colombo
Municipal Council limits, while the other 25 were reported from areas
including the Dehiwala-Mt. Lavinia Municipal Council, which has been
declared a dengue high risk zone since last week.

The highest number of dengue patients, amounting to 3341, has been
recorded in the month of July 2010 between the 1st and 24th of the
month [2010].

<http://minivannews.com/society/maldives-hit-by-dengue-fever-in-global-epidemic-9392>


Dengue fever is on the rise across the Maldives, especially in Male,
and children are the main victims, according to the Maldivian Centre
for Community Health and Disease Control (CHDC). Official records show
473 cases have been reported for 2010 up to the 1st week of July 2010,
and children aged between 1-9 years are the most effected by the
virus. "There have been no fatalities reported so far,""says the CHDC.

"In January 2010, we had 24 cases of dengue, and in April 2010, it
climbed to 28," says Zeenath Ali Habeeb, media coordinator for Indhira
Gandhi Memorial Hospital (IGMH). Figures from IGMH show that cases
almost doubled in May 2010 to 50, and by June 2010, they reached 57.

Each year, with the onset of the monsoon, there is an increase in the
number of people with dengue, according to Dr Solah, senior medical
officer at CHDC. Rain water in containers of any kind can become
mosquito breeding grounds, and this is the main reason for the
increased incidence of dengue.

The vector control unit carries out regular programmes to ensure
mosquito breeding grounds are controlled, says Dr Solah, who has
confidence in the capacity of the country's hospitals to handle dengue
cases, even though there is no specific cure. "Hospitals can only give
supportive treatment, like providing lots of fluids," he explains.
"The decline in fatalities over the years shows that our expertise has
improved in handling dengue."

Despite the regular occurrence of dengue, health authorities say it
cannot be prevented. "We are managing it as best as possible," claims
Dr Solah, "with regular inspections by the vector control unit and
advising islands and atolls to destroy mosquito breeding grounds."

Efforts to eradicate dengue are hampered by "the absence of any laws"
to penalise people and owners of buildings who habitually refuse to
clean out water containers that are fertile breeding grounds for
mosquitoes, according to Dr Solah.

Few cases of dengue have been officially reported in the islands. Most
of the known cases are in the capital. Numerous construction sites and
congested living conditions mean the inhabitants of the capital are
more likely to suffer from dengue, Dr Solah believes. "Lack of human
resources to tackle the issue is another problem," he says. Monitoring
and constant surveillance of the situation requires trained
entomologists. "Collective efforts at the individual, social and
government level are needed to tackle this public health issue."

Dengue fever has infected a handful of people in Central Florida,
health officials said. Health officials said more than a dozen people
have picked up the virus from mosquitoes in the [Florida] Keys. More
than 30 more across the state of Florida have the fever after picking
it up out of the country.

Mosquitoes in central Florida do not carry dengue [virus], but they
could if people are not careful, local doctors said. Mosquito control
experts are treating areas near where 3 Orange County people have
dengue. While the patients caught the fever somewhere else, if they
get bitten by mosquitoes, the virus could get into the local mosquito
population. "There's a possibility that you've produced enough virus
for our local mosquitoes to pick it up," said Dr. Tom Breaud with
Orange County Mosquito Control.

Doctors say anyone with dengue should stay inside, away from
mosquitoes. While most mosquitoes bite at dawn and dusk, insects
carrying dengue [virus] have a different pattern. "The mosquitoes that
transmit dengue [virus] to us bite during the day," said Breaud.

The Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Anton Cumberbatch, is now confirming
that there is a dengue fever outbreak in Trinidad and Tobago. The
announcement was made at a news conference hosted by the Ministry of
Health earlier today [23 Jul 2010]. Dr. Cumberbatch said 3 of 5 deaths
are now confirmed as dengue related, but an outbreak is not only
determined by the number of people who die of the disease. He said the
rate of infection is increasing, and there are now about 600 reported
cases. The C.M.O. said there is no telling how many people have the
disease and have sought treatment privately.

Mexico is facing a sort of perfect storm of floods that breed
mosquitoes, prompting a big increase in the number of hemorrhagic
dengue cases, the country's top epidemiological official said
Wednesday [21 Jul 2010].

The disease's [dengue virus] type 2 strain, which makes people who
have already had the type 1 variant [virus] more vulnerable to
developing the hemorrhagic form, is now in the Gulf coast state of
Veracruz and moving north toward the region on the U.S. border.

[Dengue virus] type 1 is already present in border states like
Tamaulipas, which suffered extensive flooding in the weeks after
Hurricane Alex made landfall on 30 Jun [2010]. "It is possible, if not
this year [2010] then next, for (type 2 [virus]) to reach Tamaulipas,"
said Miguel Angel Lezana, director of the National Epidemiological
Center. Veracruz borders Tamaulipas to the south.

Cases of the milder, classic form of dengue fever in Mexico have
declined slightly since 2009. But the more serious hemorrhagic form
has spiked to about 1900 cases this year [2010], compared with about
1430 in the same period of 2009. Only 16 people have died this year
from the hemorrhagic form, but the seriousness of the disease makes it
a concern.

Lezana said the recent flooding in border areas created ideal
conditions for the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes that spread dengue
fever. "Now that temperatures are rising, that is the ideal
combination: heat and humidity," Lezana said. He said state and
federal government workers are fighting the mosquitoes with control
programs. Lezana also noted the mosquitoes have adapted to living in
Mexico at altitudes up to 1850 meters (6105 feet) above sea level, at
least 350 meters (1155 feet) higher than previously recorded.

According authorities of the hospital centers in Honduras, a "more
aggressive" dengue [virus] serotype is circulating in the country and
is what caused most of the recent deaths from the hemorrhagic variant
[DHF].

Jorge Melendez, head of the Department of Pediatrics at the Maternal
and Infant Teaching Hospital Center, explained that the _Aedes
aegypti_ mosquito transmits 4 different serotypes of the dengue virus:
1, 2, 3, and 4. Serotypes 1, 3 and 4 have been circulating widely in
the country, but "at this time, Hondurans face serotype 2, which has
the distinction of being more aggressive [virulent], so one would be
observing the severe clinical pictures [seen] over the last few days,"
said Melendez. The physician said that many times, "the apparently
healthy patient arrives, and in a short time, we see a sharp decline
in their health condition, which often leads to shock and frequently
is irreversible, putting life at risk." Only this weekend in the
Maternity and Infants (Hospital) in Tegucigalpa, at least 50 children
were admitted with symptoms that were reasonably similar to DHF," said
Melendez.

President Porfirio Lobo Sosa, at the Monday [19 Jul 2010] meeting of
the Council of Ministers, established the National Front for the Fight
Against Dengue, which will coordinate activities with the Secretariat
of Health and the inhabitants of the communities most affected, among
these Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula.

Elements of the Honduran Army also have dispersed to different
neighborhoods of the capital city, where they carry out fumigation and
clean up to eradicate the mosquito that transmits dengue [virus].

To date, the authorities of the Secretariat of Health have registered
22 406 cases of classical dengue, 705 of DHF, of which 23 deaths have
been certified.

The Ministry of Health of El Salvador announced today [19 Jul 2010]
that in the coming period, a national campaign will be launched, to
prevent an epidemic of dengue which in recent weeks has seen an
increase in cases.

The Director of Surveillance of the Ministry of Health, Julio Armero,
told reporters that the work will be undertaken from Friday through
next Sunday [23-25 Jul 2010], and homes will be searched to clean up
the breeding sites of _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes, the vectors of
dengue [virus]. "The concern is the number of closed houses or poor
collaboration in cleanup actions," said Armero.

The increase in dengue cases so far this year [2010] seems to indicate
that an epidemic will continue for the remainder of July, August and
September 2010, during the rainy season, which helps to increase
mosquito breeding sites.

Until last week, 6197 confirmed cases of dengue were reported, of
which 96 are DHF.

The campaign consists of massive fumigation in various parts of the
country, delivery of chemical larvicide known as "Abate," so that
families can protect clean water [from mosquito breeding]. Talks for
awareness will be other major actions that will be promoted during the
3-day work for prevention and clean up.

"We do not want dengue to increase considerably higher," the official
said, explaining that the population most affected by the disease is
located in the municipality of Metapan in the western department
[state or province] of Santa Ana.

Among the 300 [people] who daily seek treatment in the Immediate Care
Units (UPA) in Paulista and Olinda, in Grande Recife, the proportion
of these people with symptoms of dengue reached 70 percent. Because of
the overload, coordinators of UPA Paulista do not rule out the
possibility of returning to suspension of attention to new adult
patients, as occurred on Monday night [19 Jul 2010]. We have
reinforced the group of physicians on duty at night, but the demand
[for attention] increased, and we cannot count on the municipal
[health] network," said UPA Coordinator, Vania Brayner.

According to her, in addition to new patients, those of the previous
day return to monitor their platelets (an indicator of increasing
seriousness of dengue [virus infection]). This great demand has
[caused] congestion in the laboratory of the Metropolitano Norte
Miguel Arraes Hospital. "The ideal would be for these patients to be
monitored by attention from basic municipal [health care]," she said.
