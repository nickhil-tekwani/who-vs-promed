It's my opinion that even [though being less immunogenic than modern
vaccines, F-P is a good vaccine and allowed the control of urban rabies
(animal and human) in Rio de Janeiro city and all Brazilian cities that
developed serious work in the massive animal single day vaccination.
There's no doubt that the modern vaccines are safer than it but no vaccine
failure has been reported in Brazil using F-D in the last years.
Researchers have shown that mice immunized with Flury HEP showed minimal
protection against Duvenhage and Mokola viruses, the only two known human
pathogens rabies-related viruses.
RNP is the antigen that gives the Lyssavirus group-specific antigenic cross
reactivity and even been shown that animal immunized with RNP can protect
against challenge, it's well known that neutralizing Ab are induced by the
glycoprotein (apparently responsible for the serotype determination of
Lyssavirus).

Any tissue culture rabies vaccine including human diploid cell rabies
vaccine can be used for booster immunization of persons at risk. Beside
case studies, I do not know of very long-term comparison between
brain-tissue and cell culture rabies vaccines. One of the major advantage
of tissue culture vaccine is the lack of local inflammation and allergic
reactions. I have been boosted with both types of vaccines and there is no
doubt the tissue culture vaccines are more comfortable than those prepared
in brain tissues.
As for the serotype problem, I remember some papers published by Monique
Lafon describing better elicitation of neutralizing antibody response for
PV strains than for Pitman Moore strain (Lafon et al., Immunity against the
European bat rabies virus induced by rabies vaccines: an experimental study
in mice. Vaccine, 1987,6, 362-368).It does not mean that PM tissue culture
vaccines are less efficient that those prepared in brain tissues, because
globally they induce much higher antibody titers and thus compensate the
lack of heterospecificity.
