A 13 year old Indonesian girl died of avian influenza at the weekend and 2
of her siblings have tested positive for the H5N1 virus, a health ministry
official said on Mon 16 Jan 2006, citing the results of local tests.
"We found 3 positive bird flu cases in one family coming from Indramayu,
West Java," said Hariadi Wibisono, the Ministry's director of control of
animalborne diseases. He said this was Indonesia's 5th cluster of bird flu
cases, where people living in close proximity had fallen ill. There was no
evidence of human-to-human transmission and dead chickens had been found in
the neighbourhood, he added.
If confirmed by outside laboratories recognised by the World Health
Organization (WHO), the latest cases would take total known deaths in
Indonesia from avian influenza to 13 and the number who have had avian
influenza to 20.
Wibisono said the girl died in an Indramayu hospital while her 15 year old
sister and 3 year old brother had been sent to a hospital in Jakarta
designated to care for avian influenza patients. Indramayu is 175 km (110
miles) east of Jakarta. "A lot of poultry died around the neighbourhood
where they lived. But we don't know yet whether these birds were carrying
the virus. We sent a team there to investigate this morning," he said,
adding that anyone who has had close contact with the children will be tested.
A WHO spokeswoman in Jakarta said she was not aware if a team from the
world body would go to Indramayu, but added that WHO officials usually
joined such investigations with the Health Ministry. The highly pathogenic
strain of bird flu is endemic in poultry in parts of Asia, and has affected
birds in 2/3 of the provinces in Indonesia, an archipelago of about 17 000
islands and 220 million people. The country has millions of chickens and
ducks, many in the yards of rural or urban homes, raising the risk of more
humans becoming infected with a virus that is confirmed to have killed 79
people in 6 countries since late 2003. This includes recent cases in
Turkey, the 1st human infections outside East Asia.
Experts say the H5N1 virus could become more active in the colder months in
affected regions. And there are fears there could be more cases in China,
Viet Nam and elsewhere in East Asia later this month during the Lunar New
Year when chicken will be an integral part of family reunion celebrations.
Trying to build awareness among Indonesian owners of backyard chickens, Red
Cross volunteers wearing protective suits went to a village on the
outskirts of Jakarta on Monday and showed residents how to keep poultry
cages properly cleaned.

Tests carried out by the Indonesian authorities show that a 13 year old
girl who died over the weekend was infected with avian influenza, a health
ministry official said. If confirmed, the girl from West Java would be the
country's 13th fatality of the H5N1 avian influenza virus, which has killed
79 people in Asia since 2003. Further tests will be carried out in a Hong
Kong laboratory accredited by the World Health Organization (WHO) to
confirm the finding, said ministry official Hariyadi Wibisono.
Wibisono said the girl's 2 siblings, a 15 year old sister and 3 year old
brother, are being treated for suspected bird flu, but the results of their
tests have not yet been released. "Based on the report from the team that
was sent to the area, there were plenty of chickens near their home. Some
of these chickens had died recently and all 3 children have had contact
with the dead fowl," he told Agence France-Presse.
The pair were being treated in hospital in Bandung, the capital of West
Java province. WHO on Friday confirmed that a 29 year old Indonesian woman
was the country's 12th death from bird flu. Indonesia is also awaiting
results from tests in Hong Kong on a 39 year old man who died earlier this
month. Local tests, which are usually reliable, confirmed that he also had
bird flu.
