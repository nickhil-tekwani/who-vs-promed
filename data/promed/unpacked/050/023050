MERS-CoV, Qatar
---------------
Information received on [and dated] 29 Dec 2013 from Mr Kassem Nasser Al-Qahtani, Director of Dept of Animal resources, Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Agriculture, Department of Animal resources, Doha, Qatar

Summary
Report type: Follow-up report No. 1
Date of start of the event: 14 Oct 2013
Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 26 Nov 2013
Report date: 29 Dec 2013
Date submitted to OIE: 29 Dec 2013
Reason for notification: Emerging disease
Morbidity: 3/14 (21.4 percent)
Mortality: 0 percent
Zoonotic impact: Asymptomatic exposure of camel to MERS-CoV (laboratory advanced) and one outbreak in a specific zone (Shahanya)
Causal agent: MERS-CoV
Related reports: Immediate notification (28 Nov 2013); Follow-up report No. 1 (29 Dec 2013)
Outbreaks: There are no new outbreaks in this report

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: The samples from the same herd tested using the same technique were negative, and this may show that MERS-CoV infection in camels is a self-limiting disease. The planned massive survey for MERS-CoV in animals is under implementation and the same herd is under systematic retesting. Follow-up reports will be submitted when there is new data.

Qatar says MERS-CoV-infected camels now virus-free
-----------------------------------------------------
A camel herd in Qatar that had Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections associated with 2 human MERS cases now seems to be free of the virus, Qatari authorities reported yesterday [29 Dec 2013] via the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE).

"The samples from the same herd tested using the same technique were negative and this may show that MERS-CoV infection in camels is a self-limiting disease," a Qatari agriculture official said in the OIE report.

3 of 14 camels in the herd had tested positive for the virus, according to findings reported by Qatari health officials in late November [2013]. The camels were tested in October [2013], after MERS-CoV was diagnosed in their 61-year-old owner and in a 23-year-old man who worked on the farm.

Scientists found that the camel viruses were nearly identical to the viruses in the 2 patients, according to a separate report published 2 weeks ago in the Lancet Infectious Diseases [see ProMED-mail archive no. 20131217.2120936]. But they couldn't determine if the camels had passed the virus to the humans or vice versa, or if some other host had infected both camels and humans.

The OIE report did not specify when the camel samples that tested negative were collected. Earlier reports had mentioned plans to test other animals and environmental samples from the same farm, but the OIE report did not mention any other results.

It said a planned national survey looking for MERS-CoV in animals is "under implementation," and the camel herd "is under systematic retesting," with follow-up reports to be submitted when new findings emerge. Qatari authorities were working on the investigation with experts from Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam and the Netherlands' National Institute for Public Health and the Environment.

The camels on the farm all appeared healthy or showed only mild signs of illness when they were initially tested in October [2013], OIE said in reporting the findings on 29 Nov 2013.

Camels are the leading suspects in the hunt for the source of MERS-CoV in humans, but the case against them is not yet clear. Saudi Arabian officials reported on 11 Nov 2013 that they had found the virus in a camel owned by a Jeddah man who was infected, but they have not yet published a scientific report on the finding.

[So far, 3 animal species have been found suspected to be involved in the epidemiology of MERS-CoV: initially, bats (Egyptian tomb bat, _Taphozous perforatus_) and dromedary camels (_Camelus dromedarius_) have been suspected, based upon the discovery of a fragment of viral genetic material matching the MERS-CoV in one bat from Saudi Arabia, and the above described findings in camels in Qatar and Saudi Arabia. More recently, domestic goats (_Capra hircus_) have been added to the list following the demonstration of replicative capacity of MERS-CoV in goats' kidney and lung cell lines, compared to other species (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20131219.2126531).

According to OIE's published view (updated 28 Nov 2013), more evidence is needed to directly link human infection with MERS-CoV to bats or to other animal species (see OIE's Questions and Answers about MERS-CoV at http://tinyurl.com/neydq43). In a considerable number of human MERS-CoV cases reported thus far, no contacts with animals could be confirmed.

The term "animal reservoir" in the title of this thread is applied by ProMED-mail in its broad sense, covering both potential maintenance/source animals (e.g., bats) as well as potential amplifying hosts or incidental, clinical or subclinical infections in animals. - Mod.AS
