STUDY FINDS MONKEY VIRUSES INFECT PEOPLE

WASHINGTON -- Walid Heneine and colleagues at the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) said that they have found more evidence that
people can be infected with monkey viruses, and that their findings,
reported in the journal Nature Medicine, had implications for research into
animal-to-human organ transplants. They tested the blood of 231 lab
workers who handled monkeys and found that four had become infected with
monkey viruses. Heneine was quoted as saying, "These infections, they are
happening, but they are not associated with any harm in these people."
Heneine also said he thought the implications were most important for
xenotransplants animal-to-human transplants. Researchers fear that people
given an organ of an animal such as a baboon might catch an animal virus.
Heneine said they probably would.
"The impact on xenotransplants is that yes, we have documentation that
people who receive xenotransplants from SIV-infected baboons may very
likely get infected with SIV virus, but we don't have any evidence that it
will harm them."
The article went on to say that the researchers examined three types of
retroviruses found in monkeys, SIV, simian T-cell leukemia virus, and the
third group was simian foamy viruses.
Of the infected lab workers, Heneine said, "All of them reported being
injured by these monkeys, like bites, and some of them had severe bites or
scratches. We did not see any evidence of disease. All four cases were
healthy."
So were the three of four spouses they could check, meaning there was no
evidence such viruses could be sexually transmitted, Heneine said. "We
have gone back and tested archived samples (of blood from infected lab
workers) and found that one was infected for at least 20 years and another
one was for nine years. But none of these people seemed sick either.
Despite long durations of infections, they are still very healthy and there
is no history of disease." Heneine has done other studies showing about
two-thirds of lab workers get bitten, scratched or otherwise exposed to
infections from lab monkeys, so his findings indicated a low rate of
transmission.

[This is a surprising report in view of the fact that no evidence of monkey
virus infection was found in hundreds of people tested after being given an
early type of polio vaccine made in monkey kidney cells that were later
found to contain SV40 virus (simian virus 40) - Mod.JW
