Switzerland on Thursday [27 Mar 2008] reported its 1st case of bird
flu in 2 years, after diagnosing a wild duck with the H5N1 virus,
said the Swiss federal veterinary department.

The virus was detected in a wild duck on Lake Sempach, near Lucerne,
during a regular detection programme in which 200 specimens obtained
from birds were tested.

The duck shows no symptoms of the disease, said the office, adding
that the detected virus is almost identical with those detected in
Europe in 2007.

Protective measures put in place since October 2007 remain in place,
and "additional measures such as a ban on free-range poultry is not
necessary at this time", said the office in a statement.

The risk of transmission to farmed poultry is small, indicated the office.

This case brings the total number of H5N1 cases detected in Switzerland to 33.

Previous cases were detected in February and March 2006 in wild birds
found dead in the Lake Leman and Lake Constance regions.

Earlier in 2008, wild swans tested positive for the strain of bird
flu in southwest England.
