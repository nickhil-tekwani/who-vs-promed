[2] Production issues
Date: Thu 19 Jul 2007

A Georgia plant that makes the canned chili sauce suspected in a
botulism outbreak had a production problem about 2 months ago, though
a check of the cans had found no problems, a company official said
Thu 19 Jul 2007. The Augusta plant made the sauce that is suspected
of seriously sickening an Indiana couple and 2 children in Texas.
Cans of chili sauce found in the victims' homes were produced around
the time of the Castleberry's Food Co. production problem, company
spokesman Dave Melbourne said.
About 2 months ago, cans were coming out of a heating and sterilizing
process too hot before going into a cooling canal, he said. Company
officials stopped production because they wanted to make sure cans
had not expanded and possibly allowed contamination, he said.
A check of can contents by independent evaluators also found no
problems, Melbourne said.
The sauce was named as the source of the outbreak after investigators
tested the Indiana couple and a bag of their leftover food, federal
health officials said.
The company, which is owned by Bumble Bee Seafoods LLC and based in
San Diego (California), is cooperating, though no botulism has been
found in any of their cans, Melbourne said.
State and federal investigators have not found proof of problems that
could explain the contamination, said Georgia Agriculture
Commissioner Tommy Irvin.
Investigators traced the sickness of the Texas siblings, ages 12 and
13, to a 28 Jun 2007 meal of hot dogs slathered with chili sauce.
Investigators believe the husband and wife in Indiana got sick from a
5 Jul 2007 meal that included chili sauce and baked potatoes. All 4
of the patients became seriously ill and had to be placed on
ventilators, health officials said.
On Wed 18 Jul 2007, Castleberry's announced a recall of 10 brands of
chili sauce, hash and other canned products. The company recalled the
7 other products that weren't the subject of the FDA warning because
they were produced during the same time as the production problem,
Melbourne said. "We decided on the recall just to be safe," he said.
About 20 000 cases, more than 300 000 cans, were recalled from 22
states, mostly in the Southeast, Midwest, and Southwest, Melbourne
said. About 450 people work at the plant where they were produced, he
said.
