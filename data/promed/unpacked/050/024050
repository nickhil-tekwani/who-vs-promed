A new outbreak of bird flu has killed about 1000 poultry in northern China
in the 2nd such case in a week, state media reported. Some 72 930 domestic
poultry have been slaughtered and the outbreak is now under control, Xinhua
news agency said. Laboratory tests had confirmed the H5N1 strain of the
virus, which can be deadly to humans, it added.
The outbreak, in Henan New Village in Yinchuan, regional capital of the
desert-like Ningxia Hui region, follows a similar occurrence in
neighbouring Inner Mongolia. Beijing banned chicken exports from the Baotou
region of Inner Mongolia after H5N1 killed about 1000 chickens and ducks
there. Xinhua said on Tuesday that the Baotou outbreak, which came to light
on 27 Sep, had been brought under control. It was the 1st incidence
reported in China in 6 weeks.
According to official figures, 21 people in China have contracted bird flu
and 14 of them have died. The most recent fatality occurred in July in the
western region of Xinjiang. The latest case in Ningxia Hui brings to 40 the
number of bird flu outbreaks among poultry in China since October 2005.
China confirmed in August that its 1st human bird flu victim died in late
2003, 2 years earlier than previously reported.

A healthy chicken could be a carrier of the bird flu virus although it
shows no symptoms of the illness, a health official warned Wednesday. Head
of the West Java Animal Husbandry Office, Rachmat Setiadi, said the warning
was made following the discovery of healthy chickens that tested positive
with H5N1 virus from a serology test conducted on 20 chickens around the
house of 2 dead flu victims -- a 23-year-old man and his 20-year-old
brother -- in Kebonwaru area, Batunggal.
"The test has shown that 4 healthy chickens were infected with H5N1. We
should be more cautious," he said Wednesday in Bandung.
Currently, people are only made aware of the danger of bird flu when
chickens die suddenly in their neighborhood, but Rachmat said healthy
chickens could also be carriers. He said cases where healthy chickens were
infected with bird flu had occurred not only in Bandung, but also in other
cities and regencies. However, he did not name the cities or regencies. He
recommended that residents stop keeping chickens in their backyards or near
their houses.
Out of Bandung's 26 cities and regencies, only 2 -- Tasikmalaya city and
Ciamis regency -- are free of H5N1 virus in poultry.
Meanwhile, serology tests on 11 dogs kept by the family of the bird flu
cluster in Kebonwaru have came back negative, according to head of Bandung
City Agriculture Office, Yogi Supardjo. He said the result showed that dogs
could not spread the virus. He said his office was currently working on a
public campaign in 26 districts to make people aware of the threat of bird
flu following these deaths.

[Finding a seroconversion in a healthy bird is not the same as proving that
these birds are or are not capable of transmitting the virus. While it is
over-simplistic to hold that only sick birds transmit virus, one would like
to see evidence of a more thorough investigation as to other flocks that
these 2 men might have been exposed to in their village. And are 4 putative
viraemic birds sufficient to infect 2 men and no more chickens in intimate
contact?
Many years ago when I worked on Newcastle disease with Bill Allen at
Weybridge, we found that vaccinated birds when subsequently infected stayed
healthy but shed ND virus, albeit a fraction of that shed by fully
susceptible birds. However, for HPAI we need more evidence than this
interesting report. - Mod.MHJ]
