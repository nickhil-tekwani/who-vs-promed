At least one human has gotten tuberculosis from a marine animal as noted
in
the following reference.

This is a compilation of cases of mycobacteriosis or
_Mycobacterium_ sp. isolation in marine mammals
[and their human contacts.
_Mycobacterium marinum_ is an opportunistic pathogen of man, and has
been isolated from cutaneous granulomas. It has also been [connected to
infection of a person that handled a manatee with a wound infection by
this organism, and with a long-term infection of a person that was
bitten by a dolphin. _M. smegmatis_, a mycobacterium found in soil and
water, was responsible for a fatal infection of a captive sea lion.(1)
_Mycobacterium bovis_ has been isolated from captive pinnipeds. (3)
Association of non-tuberculous mycobacteria with disease in marine
mammals is uncommon. Some reports describe a systemic _M. marinum_
infection in a manatee (_Trichechus ingunguis_), a _M. chelonei_
pyoderma
in a manatee, and respiratory diseases and abscesses in a grey seal
(_Halichoerus grypus_) associated with _M. fortuitum_ and _M. chelonei_.
A generalised infection associated with _M. smegmatis_ has been reported
in a California sea lion (_Zalophus californianus_). (4)
2 other cases suggestive of mycobacterial
infection have been reported in zoo-held manatees. (2)
A cutaneous mycobacterial infection that was refractory to antibiotic
treatment has been reported in a harbour seal (_Phoca vitulina
concolor_). Initially, _Mycobacterium chitae_ was identified in the
inflammatory lesions; the presence of this organism may or may not
have been significant in this case because it is considered to be
non-pathogenic. Afterwards, _Mycobacterium fortuitum_ was isolated from
the skin and exhibit water. Intradermal tuberculin tests were
performed and the results were negative. Lesions present in the lung
and bronchial lymph node were consistent with dissemination of the
mycobacteria infection, and the acid-fast organisms were observed in
these tissues.
_Mycobacterium fortuitum_ is a saprophytic organism. It
is ubiquitous in the environment and can be isolated from soil, water,
and other natural sources. It has been associated with disease in
humans, a dog, and a grey seal. (4)
It is important to know that the
interpretation of intradermal tuberculin testing in pinnipeds may be
complicated by sensitisation of the animals to non-pathogenic
mycobacteria. (3)
