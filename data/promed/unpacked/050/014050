Avian influenza situation in Cambodia - update
----------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health (MoH) of the Kingdom of Cambodia has announced a confirmed case of human infection with avian influenza A (H5N1) virus.

The 6-year-old female from Kampong Chhnang Province developed symptoms on 22 Mar 2012. After initial treatment at her village, she was later admitted to hospital in Phnom Penh on 28 Mar 2012. She died on 30 Mar 2012. Infection with avian influenza A (H5N1) virus was confirmed by Institut Pasteur du Cambodge on 30 Mar 2012. It was reported that the patient had contact with sick or dead poultry prior to onset of illness.

The National and local Rapid Response Teams (RRT) are conducting outbreak investigation and response following the national protocol. In addition, a public health education campaign is being conducted to inform families on how to protect themselves from contracting avian influenza.

To date, of the 20 cases reported in Cambodia since 2005, 18 have been fatal.
