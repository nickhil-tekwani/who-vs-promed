Madagascar's battle against a cholera epidemic is being complicated by a
spat between the government of one of the world's poorest countries and an
acclaimed international aid agency. More than 1000 Malagasies - as
residents of this Indian Ocean island are called - have died since the
epidemic erupted a year ago, according to official figures. Most health
officials believe the death toll is higher, even as the government said
Wednesday the epidemic is "diminishing." In a battle on the sidelines, the
Swiss section of Doctors Without Borders announced Tuesday it was
abandoning its cholera-fighting operations in the country because the
government refused it access to victims. "The reason they gave (was) `We
the people of Madagascar can care for our own population," said Thomas
Nierle, a Doctors Without Borders official. "I think it's a question of
sovereignty. It's a lot of pride. It's almost arrogant." The government,
for its part, made a similar accusation against Doctors Without Borders,
which won the Nobel Peace Prize last year for bringing medical aid to
conflict areas worldwide. "(Doctors Without Borders) has treated us like a
war-torn country with no ability to conduct its own health initiatives,
dictating what we do," Armand Ralaidovy, the Health Ministry's coordinator
for combating cholera, said in an interview. "Their statement was
derogatory." "We have more than 2000 doctors. We have the health
infrastructure," he said. Ralaidovy said the government was ably handling
the epidemic. But some of the criticism has come from Madagascar's own
doctors. On Tuesday, a local association of doctors known by its French
acronym SEDODIA called for Heath Minister Henriette Rahantalalao to resign,
saying she was bungling the handling of the epidemic. Soon after the
epidemic broke out, the Ministry of Defense erected roadblocks on major
highways. All travelers were required to take heavy doses of oral
antibiotics in a move many critics said was ineffective and even dangerous.
Giving antibiotics to those without cholera serves no purpose, and raises
the general population's resistance to the drugs. The roadblocks were taken
down on 26 Nov 1999, but were put back up a few weeks ago and only
travelers complaining of diarrhea were then given the antibiotics. This
Texas-sized island off southeast Africa is known to the 100 000-plus
tourists who visit annually for its unspoiled beaches, virgin rain forests
and sightings of lemurs and humpback whales. But behind the pristine
attractions lie poverty and unsanitary living conditions - a breeding
ground for cholera. Only one in three people have access to clean water in
Madagascar, the 13th poorest nation on the planet. Only 3 percent have
access to flush toilets. Most even lack the money to buy charcoal to boil
water, a critical step in preventing cholera, an acute intestinal
infection that causes copious diarrhea, which can quickly lead to
dehydration and death. On Wednesday, 16 patients with severe diarrhea
checked into the dim, run-down Befelatanana Hospital in Antananarivo. A
crowded roomful of listless men, women and children were laid out on cots
with IV cords dangling above them. A notice in an office around the corner
reminded medical personnel to require relatives to take special
precautions in burying the bodies of cholera victims, to prevent more
infections. Doctors said about 50 cholera patients were in the hospital,
down from more than 100 in recent weeks. The Health Ministry said
Wednesday the worst of the epidemic was over. "The outbreak has peaked and
now is diminishing because of our interventions," Ralaidovy said in an
interview. But Nierle, who recently completed a 13-month tour of duty in
Madagascar and was interviewed by phone from Geneva, said there were no
signs the epidemic was slowing. A total of 18 809 suspected cholera cases
have been identified in the past year in Madagascar, the government said.
A reported 1070 people have died.

Cholera cases and deaths reported in parts of Somalia 18 people have died
and 54 cases reported between 1-13 Feb 2000 following a cholera outbreak
in Marka and Qoryooley in central Somalia, an official of the Somalia Aid
Coordination Body's (SACB) Cholera Task Force told IRIN on Thursday. He
denied press reports that between three to four people were dying in these
areas every day. He said in Forlanini in northern Mogadishu where
MSF-Spain has set up a cholera treatment center, three deaths and 100
cases have been reported. He also said that in southern Mogadishu at the
Action Contre la Faim (ACF) center in Hirja 11 cases have been reported
with no deaths. "The situation is not as alarming as portrayed by the news
organizations," he said. WHO is also providing assistance to the centers.

Cholera has so far this year killed four of 118 patients who were admitted
to a medical camp in Dar es Salaam, an official source confirmed. The other
114 patients were discharged after they recovered, said Boniface Maleko,
the Kinonconi District Disease Control Coordinator. Most of the residents
mentioned Gide River running through the city as a source of the outbreak
because most of the people living close to it use its water, the Guardian
newspaper reported Tuesday. Laboratory analysis has shown that the amount
of cholera bacteria in the river is at an unsafe level, the coordinator was
quoted as saying. Maleko said that a campaign has been launched to warn
residents against drinking un boiled water from the river. Besides, a total
of 250 kilograms of chlorine, a chemical used in treating water, have been
sent to several districts in the capital city and will be sprinkled in
shallow wells. Cholera is a major threat to Tanzanians. Official statistics
show that Tanzania has been worse affected by the disease in the past 3
years than any other country in Africa, with over 50 000 cases and more
than 3000 deaths reported. Cholera is transmitted by poor hygiene from one
person to another, or people can pick it up from dirty water or the soil
clinging to vegetables.
