[1] Sierra Leone: increased quarantine restrictions
Date: 25 Sep 2014

http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/26/world/africa/ebola-epidemic-sierra-leone-quarantine.html?_r=0


Acknowledging that the EVD epidemic sweeping Sierra Leone was worsening, officials here put hundreds of thousands of more citizens under quarantine on Thu [25 Sep 2014], sealing off more than a quarter of the country and warning travelers not to get out of their vehicles in [when passing through] the districts under isolation.

Nearly all of the country's 14 districts are now under either total or partial quarantine, with over one million people affected, as the disease advances into areas that have previously not been affected. Infection rates have been rising in the capital, Freetown, a dangerous development because of the city's density.

In an address to citizens late Wednesday night [24 Sep 2014], President Ernest Bai Koroma acknowledged that the new quarantine orders would "definitely pose great difficulties for our people," but he suggested that officials had little choice. Makeni, the largest city in the country's Northern Province, is in one of the newly quarantined districts, and foreign health care workers are particularly worried about a surge in infections there.

[Travelers by road from Guinea through Sierra Leone to Liberia have many alternative routes, most of them now quarantined; see map at: http://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/8/84/Sierra-leone-regions-map.png/350px-Sierra-leone-regions-map.png. - Mod.JW]

[4] Nigeria EVD-free?
Date: 25 Sep 2014
Source: IB Times [edited]
http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/nigeria-ebola-free-president-goodluck-jonathan-tells-un-1467150


Nigeria is "Ebola-free," President Goodluck Jonathan tells the UN. The president made the comment during a UN General Assembly in New York.

"We can confidently say that today [25 Sep 2014], Nigeria is Ebola-free," said Jonathan.

However, an email from the head of the Emergency Operation Centre for Ebola in Lagos, Faisal Shuaib, said: "The outbreak in Nigeria can be declared officially over only if there are no more cases after 42 days, or 2 incubation periods from the last confirmed case."

Eight people have died out of 20 confirmed Ebola cases in Nigeria since July 2014, and Nigeria has not reported any new cases since 8 Sept 2014.

[5] Germany: 2000 army volunteers to fight EVD in West Africa

More than 2000 Germans have volunteered to travel to West Africa to help fight the Ebola outbreak. The country's 1st shipment of roughly 10 tons of supplies leaves Thu [25 Sep 2014].

On Wed [24 Sep 2014], Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen announced that 2000 German soldiers had volunteered for duty in Africa to aid in the battle against EVD...

Ursula von der Leyen says she didn't expect such a large and sudden response. The answer to a call for help the defense minister made on Monday [22 Sep 2014] "moved and overwhelmed" her, she said. However, she added that the Bundeswehr [army] still needed to check the experience and vaccination histories of the active-duty soldiers, reservists and civilians who signed up.

[It's not clear whether the civilians who signed up are included in the 2000 total, but this is hopeful news. Perhaps, to avoid potential problems, the USA should also consider deploying only volunteers from the military? - Mod.JW]

[6] UK: NHS pharmacists & other volunteers
Date: 25 Sep 2014
Source: Pharmaceutical Journal UK [edited]
http://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/news-and-analysis/news-in-brief/uk-pharmacists-asked-to-volunteer-in-ebola-outbreak/20066630.article


UK pharmacists have been urged to volunteer in the fight against EVD in West Africa in an open letter from 4 of the most senior figures in UK healthcare. The letter, signed by Dame Sally Davies, chief medical officer at the Department of Health, says that staff wishing to help should register with the UK International Emergency Medical Register. It said that NHS-funded organisations will have individual "leave policies" in place but cautioned that "safe staffing levels and services are maintained in the NHS in England."

A range of healthcare professionals may be required, including doctors, nurses, paramedics, pharmacists, psychologists, health information managers, logisticians and outreach managers, says the letter. At last count, about 200 NHS staff had volunteered to work in West Africa.

Re: the comment in Ebola virus disease - West Africa (173): WHO, Sierra Leone, respirators, aid, Archive No. 20140922.2792415:

["There is no mention of hiccups, a characteristic symptom in the Kikwit epidemic and also in Uganda; see ProMED-mail posting Ebola virus disease - West Africa (86): WHO, UNSC, ECOWAS, Guinea, Liberia 20140711.2603448 and CDC MMWR archives. - Mod.JW"]

You may wish to make this correction: The paper does mention hiccups in more than one place, e.g. in Table 1.

[He is right. I should have referred to the original article at http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1411100#t=articleTop and written: "There is no mention of hiccups in this news report." - Mod.JW]

[8] Prevention & suspected cases

FDA: fake drug alert
--------------------------
24 Sep 2014: (WaPo) The US Food and Drug Administration [FDA] sent letters to 3 companies this week warning them against marketing their products as possible treatments or cures for EVD. The letters, posted online on Wed [24 Sep 2014], document multiple claims from the companies or their paid representatives that essential oils and other natural remedies can "help prevent your contracting the ebolavirus," and in at least one instance, "effectively kill the ebolavirus." There are currently no approved treatments, cures or vaccines for EVD. Natural Solutions Foundation, Young Living, and doTERRA International LLC all produce products that were promoted on the Web as cures for a variety of ailments, all without FDA approval. The products in question, the letters note, are not FDA-approved drugs, yet their marketing makes the sort of claims that only approved drugs may make, that they can be used to treat, mitigate, prevent and cure diseases. According to the 3 letters, those promotions -- either on Web sites ... Pinterest messages, Facebook postings and blog posts -- claim that products such as "CBD Organic Dark Chocolate Bars," "Clary Sage" essential oils and the "Family Protection Pack" can do what has not yet been done: Treat, cure or prevent the deadly ebolavirus.

Liberia: call for convalescent blood donors
---------------------------------------
24 Sep 2014: (Reuters) The head of an EVD treatment center in Liberia, the country worst-hit by West Africa's deadly Ebola outbreak, has urged survivors of the disease to donate their blood for use in treating infected patients. "We need survivors to come and help us with blood donations," said Attai Omoruto, the Ugandan doctor in charge of the newly opened, 150-bed Island Clinic in Liberia's capital Monrovia.

Netherlands: repatriated patients do not have EVD
-----------------------------------------------
24 Sep 2014: (Dutch News) A Dutch doctor and a man from Eindhoven [Netherlands] who have been under observation in hospitals in Leiden and Nijmegen do not have EVD, the public health institute RIVM said on Wednesday [24 Sep 2014]. Both had reported having a raised temperature and had been in countries where EVD is present. Tests have now shown they do not have the virus but do both have malaria, the RIVM said.

Russia: quarantines Africa students
---------------------------------------
24 Sep 2014: (Xinhua) Russian consumer safety watchdog Rospotrebnadzor places all newly arrived residents from the high-risk countries under a 3-week quarantine. Some 335 students from high-risk regions in Africa remain in quarantine in Russia for Ebola, a Russian health official said Wed [24 Sep 2014]. About 1000 residents from African countries were put in quarantine for the virus, and the majority have been cleared, the Interfax news agency quoted Chief Sanitary Inspector Anna Popova as saying. No case of EBV has been detected in Russia, she said, adding that, due to high migration flows, the country is not 100 percent guaranteed [safe] from the risk. Russian authorities are prepared not to let the virus spread into the country, with strict medical control imposed at the ports of entry, she said. At Moscow's airports, [arriving passengers] must walk through detectors that sound an alarm if the person's body temperature is above normal. Russian scientists have been working on a cure for EVD for over 10 years, Popova said. http://www.shanghaidaily.com/article/article_xinhua.aspx?id=243062

[Re: "high migration flows," it did not say whether they are quarantining immigrants from certain African countries. - Mod.JW]

Zimbabwe: quarantines Nigerians, others
-----------------------------
25 Sep 2014: (News Day) At least 98 people have reportedly been placed under EVD quarantine in Harare, the capital city of Zimbabwe. The country has taken strict measures in monitoring visitors who wish to enter the country. This comes as fears continue to grow that the deadly ebolavirus might spread beyond West Africa where the epidemic has killed 2800 people. According to News Day, out of the 98 people who have been quarantined, 84 were coming from Nigeria.
