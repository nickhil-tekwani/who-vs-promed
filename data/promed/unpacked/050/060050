The Health Ministry on [20 Mar 2008] officially stated that vaccine
has not been the cause of the post-vaccination deaths of several
babies since 2007.

In 7 cases in which babies suffered serious shock after vaccinations
so far this year [2008], 5 were coincidental, one was caused by a
service mistake, and one had no clear reason.

Dr Nguyen Tran Hien, head of the Central Epidemiology Institute, said
in most of the cases without reasons, dead bodies were not autopsied
so doctors don't have sufficient information to give the reasons for
the children's death (the children's parents didn't allow doctors to
operate on the dead bodies).

Hien said some babies died after vaccination because of their
parents' mistakes. Among investigated cases, there are 3 cases in
which the parents didn't know when their children died. He quoted the
case of a child's death in Dong Anh district, Hanoi during the recent
lunar New Year. The child's parents left their baby at home alone for
16 hours during the cold weather and when they returned, the child
had died already. Doctors determined that the child died because of
bleeding pneumonia, not vaccine.

Jean [Marc Olive], chief representative of the World Health
Organisation (WHO) in Viet Nam, confirmed that post-vaccination
deaths of babies caused by other reasons, not vaccinations, is
common, especially for newborn babies. In the 1st 28 days in life,
babies are prone to death because of various reasons. If a death
coincides with a vaccination, the vaccination is easily [blamed] as
the reason, but without the vaccination, the child might still have died.

Since 2007 many post-vaccination child deaths have been reported in
Viet Nam. After each case, the Health Ministry performed an
investigation but it has only just announced results.

Last year [2007] Viet Nam recorded 29 cases of serious shock and
death after vaccination. A total of 15 cases were determined to be
coincidences (caused by other reasons, not vaccination); 10 cases
were without specific reasons: one was self-protection shock; and
only 3 were due to vaccination service mistakes.

Dr Hien also explained why most of the post-vaccination deaths are
related to hepatitis B vaccine. He said this vaccine was added to the
national expanded vaccination programme in 2003. The number of babies
vaccinated with hepatitis B vaccine has increased highly so the
number of complications also increases. In 2006, the percentage of
newborn babies who were injected with this vaccine in the 1st 24
hours was 66 percent and thus the number of child deaths after
hepatitis B vaccination increased.

The Health Ministry confirmed that the post-vaccination complication
percentage is still at an acceptable threshold for all kinds of
current vaccines.

[Because parents were] [f]rightened by post-vaccination deaths, the
proportion of vaccinated children in Viet Nam last year [2007] fell
from 96 percent to 81
percent. The percentage of newborn babies who got the 1st hepatitis B
injection within the 1st 24 hours plunged from 66 percent in 2006 to
28 percent in 2007. The ratio of children who got all 3 injections
also declined from 98 percent to 71 percent.

[The newswire above provides final diagnoses for the 29 cases of
serious shock and death reported in Viet Nam during 2007 that were
temporally associated with receipt of the hepatitis B vaccine (HBV)
[see ProMED refs. below]. 15 cases were 'determined to be coincidences
(caused by other reasons, not vaccination)', 10 cases were 'without
specific reasons', one was self-protection shock (?), and only 3 were
due to vaccination service mistakes. Of the 7 cases where infants had
serious shock following vaccinations this year (2008) 5 were
coincidental, one was caused by a service mistake, and one had no
clear reason.

More information on these conclusions would be greatly appreciated as
they are difficult to 'judge' based on the newswire descriptions.

The current scientific literature does not support a theory of a
temporal association of HBV receipt with sudden death in infants.

In a letter to the editor, Zinkaa et al. described a 13-fold increase
in deaths temporally associated with receipt of vaccine during the
period 2001 through 2004 following receipt of the hexavalent vaccine
(6 antigens) as compared with the number of deaths reported during the
period 1995 though 2000 following receipt of the pentavalent vaccine
(5 antigens). The difference between the 2 vaccines was the addition
of the hepatitis immune globulin in the later period. While there were
neuropathologic findings on autopsy, they were not felt to be
contributing to the death of the infants and actual numbers of deaths
within 24 hours of receipt of the vaccine did not surpass that
expected by chance alone (see ref 1).

Von Kreis et al. used standardized mortality ratios for deaths that
occurred within 1-28 days following administration of either of the 2
hexavalent vaccines in the 1st and 2nd year of life using the
respective annual rates for sudden unexpected deaths (SUDs) from the
national vital statistics. Their analysis did not show a cause-effect
association with receipt of the vaccine and SUD, although there was a
possible trend association with one of the 2 vaccines, thereby
suggesting the need for enhanced surveillance for sudden deaths
temporally associated with receipt of the vaccine (see ref 2).

Balci et al. reported on a pair of identical twins with simultaneous
sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) 48 hours after receipt of 2nd dose
OPV [oral polio vaccine], 2nd dose DPT [diphtheria, pertussis,
tetanus] and 1st dose of HBV (see ref 3).

DiMiceli et al. review the reports to the USA-based vaccine adverse
events reporting system (VAERS) addressing the issue of anaphylactic
reactions following receipt of the recombinant HBV in yeast sensitive
individuals. There were 11 reports of probable anaphylactic events out
of 107 reports of "yeast allergy" with no deaths. Age group of
affected individuals ranged from 10 to 64 years of age, with no
infants in this reported group (see ref 4).

Erickson et al. studied reviewed records on more than 300 000 births
during the period 1993 to 1998. In this cohort, 67 percent had
received HBV at birth while only 72 (5 percent) of neonates who died
were HBV-vaccinated at birth (p less than 0.01). They found no
significant difference in the proportion of HBV-vaccinated (31
percent) and unvaccinated (35 percent) neonates dying of unexpected
causes (p = 0.6). They were not able to identify a plausible causal or
temporal relationship between HBV administration and death for the 22
vaccinated neonates who died unexpectedly (see ref 5).

That being said, the reports of increased deaths temporally associated
with receipt of HBV vaccine in Viet Nam raised the question as to
whether there was a possible vaccine manufacture-associated event
ongoing in Viet Nam.

This moderator has not forgotten the 'major increase' in SIDS reported
in the USA following receipt of DTP (the USA refers to the vaccine as
DTP and not DPT) vaccine in the late 1970s during the early stages of
implementation of a new monitoring system to address adverse events
temporally associated with the receipt of vaccinations. (In the early
days this system was referred to as ARMS -- 'adverse reaction
monitoring system'.) At the time, statistical analyses did not support
the apparent observed increase in SIDS reports within 24 hours
following receipt of the vaccine (daily expected numbers of SIDS
deaths were projected, taking into account seasonality). While there
were many more SIDS cases reported with a history of vaccine receipt
in the 24 hours preceding the event, the numbers of cases of SIDS
reported on a daily basis for these days were within the expected
range, and the numbers of cases reported on a daily basis as one got
further from date of receipt of vaccine were lower than actually
expected).

In response to this observation, major studies were commissioned. In
2002 there was an Institute of Medicine (IOM) review panel to
'definitively' address the issue of temporal association of vaccine
receipt with SIDS and 'sudden unexpected deaths in infancy' (SUDI).
The committee reviewed epidemiologic evidence focusing on 3 outcomes:
SIDS, all SUDI, and neonatal death (infant death, whether sudden or
not, during the 1st 4 weeks of life). Based on this review, the
committee concluded that the evidence favors rejection of a causal
relationship between some vaccines and SIDS; and that the evidence is
inadequate to accept or reject a causal relationship between other
vaccines and SIDS, SUDI, or neonatal death (see ref 6 below).

Through the highly perceptive and sensitive retrospectoscope, it is
likely that the observed 'association' of SIDS with receipt of DTP
vaccine may well have been a function of the implementation of a new
reporting/monitoring system that led to an increased awareness of any
adverse event following receipt of vaccine.

Of additional note in the IOM study above was the committee statement
on HBV vaccine and association with SIDS or SUDI. HBV is the only
vaccine administered during the neonatal period in the USA. The
committee reviewed data on neonatal death following receipt of HBV
from a single unpublished controlled observational study and from a
single published report describing VAERS data. The committee concluded
that given the limitations of these data sources for assessing
causality, the evidence is inadequate to accept or reject a causal
relationship between HBV and neonatal death.

If the data mentioned in the newswire above are conclusive in ruling
out the possibility of a temporal association of sudden infant deaths
with receipt of the HBV, one can't help but wonder if these reports
were coincident with the implementation of a more sensitive adverse
event following immunization (AEFI) reporting system in Viet Nam.
PRO/MBDS would greatly appreciate receiving information from the
official report on the results of the investigations on these deaths.
