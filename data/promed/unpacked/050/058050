The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) yesterday [Thu 9 Aug 2018] confirmed 9 new cases of Lassa fever epidemic with 2 deaths, in one week, including the 1st confirmed case in Enugu State since beginning of outbreak.

The NCDC, however, blamed the persistent outbreak of Lassa fever in the country on poor environmental sanitation conditions observed in high burden communities.

Latest figures from the NCDC published yesterday [Thu 9 Aug 2018] stated: "In the reporting Week 31 (w/e 5 Aug 2018), 9 new confirmed cases were reported from Edo (7), Ondo (1) and Enugu (1) with 2 new deaths from Edo (one) and Enugu (one).

According to the NCDC report, 22 states have recorded at least one confirmed case across 72 local councils (Edo, Ondo, Bauchi, Nasarawa, Ebonyi, Anambra, Benue, Kogi, Imo, Plateau, Lagos, Taraba, Delta, Osun, Rivers, FCT, Gombe, Ekiti, Kaduna, Abia, Adamawa and Enugu - the new addition) and 19 states have exited the active phase of the outbreak while 3 - Edo Ondo and Enugu states - remain active.

The Centre noted that no new healthcare worker was infected but 39 healthcare workers have been affected since the onset of the outbreak in 7 states - Ebonyi (16), Edo (14), Ondo (4), Kogi (2), Nasarawa (1), Taraba (1) and Abia (1) with 10 deaths in Ebonyi (6), Kogi (1), Abia (1), Ondo (1) and Edo (1).

According to the NCDC, 82 percent of all confirmed cases are from 3 states; Edo (44 percent), Ondo (24 percent) and Ebonyi (14 percent) while 10 patients are currently being managed at treatment centres - 7 at Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital (ISTH) and 3 at the Federal Medical Centre Owo Treatment Centre.

The Centre noted that a total of 6383 contacts have been identified from 22 states. Of these, 439 (6.9 percent) are currently being followed up, 5846 (91.6 percent) have completed 21 days follow up while 10 (0.2 percent) were lost to follow up. As many as 88 (1.4 percent) symptomatic contacts have been identified, of which 30 (34 percent) have tested positive from 5 states (Edo-14, Ondo-8, Ebonyi-3, Kogi-3, Bauchi-1 and Adamawa-1).

[The above report provides the latest summary of the ongoing Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria. The specific circumstances under which the reported infections might have been acquired are not mentioned but are blamed on generally poor sanitary conditions. Presumably the public sensitization campaign carried out earlier in the year (2018) provided information to the populace about the danger of contamination of food and the environment by infected rats and how to avoid it. Getting local people to understand that virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent hosts (genera _Mastomys_ and _Hylomyscus_) or their excreta can be difficult. Preventing this contact requires understanding that leads to action. Rodent control has to be undertaken at the village level with individual households. This requires an extensive and continuous public education effort. No mention is made of the prevalence of Lassa fever virus in rodent populations in any of the affected states.

Images of the rodent reservoirs of Lassa fever virus, _Mastomys natalensis_ (Natal multimammate mouse), _M. erythroleucus_ (Guinea multimammate mouse), and _Hylomyscus pamfi_ can be seen at https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/27025056/rats1.jpg.
