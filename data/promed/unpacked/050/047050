One case of [animal] rabies has been confirmed in Zemun, one of Belgrade`s
suburban districts.
A cat infected with rabies injured 4 persons.The infection has been
declared in Zemun and the vicinity, Novi Beograd and Zemun polje are
considered to be in the zone of danger.
The injured were treated with vaccine and serum. Rabies has been
confirmed by the Serbian veterinarian institute.
According to Dr. Bozidar Antonijevic, the chief of the Polyclinic
diagnostic centre of the Institute for infective and tropical diseases,
Belgrade is not the only place where rabies has been found
recently. Some infected foxes have been discovered in the
province of Vojvodina (Northern Serbia) and in the vicinity of Gornji
Milanovac (Central Serbia).
