Avian influenza in South Africa: (Date of previous outbreak of avian
influenza in South Africa reported to the OIE: August 2005).
Information received on 3 Jul 2006 from Dr Botlhe Modisane, Senior Manager of
Animal Health, National Department of Agriculture, Pretoria:
Reason for immediate notification: re-occurrence of a listed disease or
infection in a country or zone/compartment following a report declaring the
outbreak(s) ended.
Identification of agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5N2.
Date of start of the event: 19 Jun 2006.
An outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza has been reported at
Riversdale in Western Cape province in an ostrich rearing farm (58 ostriches)
aged 4 months.
The diagnosis has been established on 1 Jul 2006 by the ARC Onderstepoort
Veterinary Institute by RT-PCR and sequence analysis.
Preliminary surveillance indicates that the outbreak is probably limited to
the single farm (8 cases) in which the disease was detected. The farm has been
put under quarantine (10-km-radius zone) and all 58 ostriches have been
destroyed on 1 Jul 2006. Culling of all other poultry in the index farm was
completed on 3 Jul 2006.

[First of all, this is _not_ the Avian Influenza virus that has infected
humans. We have previously seen this virus -- Highly Pathogenic Avian
Influenza H5N2 (HPAI H5N2) -- in North America and Europe. In 1983, a now
historic outbreak in Pennsylvania in the USA was attributed to H5N2. Mexico
(1994) and Texas, USA (2004) also had North American HPAI H5N2 outbreaks.
Italy had HPAI H5N2 in 1997 (Italy also had HPAI H7N1 in turkeys in 1999-
2000). A complete table of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza outbreaks in
poultry by subtype until the end of 2003 is available at
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2004_03_02/en/>.
Also, interestingly, we have official OIE information that indicates the farm
that had the original Nigerian outbreak of HPAI H5N1 (Jaji, in Kaduna State)
also had ostriches and geese. Does anyone know if the ostriches were sick and
had samples taken, and if so, were they also positive? Any information on the
susceptibility of ostriches, particularly on farms, would be of interest. -
