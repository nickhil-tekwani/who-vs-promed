6 children die from rabies in 9 months -- Korle Bu
--------------------------------------------------
Statistics from the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital's Child Health Department [Accra, Ghana] indicates 6 children have died from rabies between January and September 2015. The statistics indicate in 2013 the hospital recorded 3 cases while 4 cases were also recorded in 2014.

Rabies is an infectious viral disease that is almost always fatal following the onset of clinical signs. According to the World Health Organisation, in more than 99 percent of human cases, the virus is transmitted by domestic dogs. Rabies affects domestic and wild animals and is spread to people through bites or scratches, usually via saliva.

Resident Doctor at the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital's Child Health Department, Dr. Hilda Mantebea-Boye, told Adom News rabies attacks [are] on the rise and urged parents to report any case of rabies-related diseases to the nearest hospitals for treatment. "The menace is so disturbing and it's about time the city authorities and the veterinary department intensify public education," Dr. Hilda Mantebea-Boye said. She said other stakeholders must also collaborate with the various health facilities to prevent further increase in the numbers of the viral infection.

She also added that the authorities must pick up stray dogs on city streets to check rabies attacks.

Dr. Mantebea-Boye also advised doctors and nurses at clinics in rural areas to contact experts from bigger hospitals when a suspected rabid case is brought to them to prevent people from losing their lives.

Meanwhile, Director of Public Health, Ghana Health Services (GHS), Dr. Badu Sarkodie, says the health service, the Veterinary Services Directorate and other stakeholders are educating Ghanaians about the disease.

[I fear there is a need for better education about human rabies. Once symptoms have started it is too late. The patient will die midst horrifying nightmares. It is not a pleasant death. The only way to prevent human rabies cases, which are effectively all but inevitable once symptoms have started, is to treat the bite wound immediately by flushing it and injecting anti-serum (dose is weight dependent), followed by a series of 4 vaccinations. In the United States, post-exposure prophylaxis consists of a regimen of one dose of immune globulin and 4 doses of rabies vaccine over a 14-day period. Rabies immune globulin and the 1st dose of rabies vaccine should be given by your health care provider as soon as possible after exposure. Additional doses or rabies vaccine should be given on days 3, 7, and 14 after the 1st vaccination. Current vaccines are relatively painless and are given in your arm, like a flu or tetanus vaccine (extracted from: http://www.cdc.gov/rabies/exposure/index.html).

According to OIE, Ghana reported 21 cases of rabies in 2014; 4 in 2013; 15 in 2012; 14 in 2011; and 19 in 2010. The events in Korle Bu are but the tip of a nasty iceberg. - Mod.MHJ
