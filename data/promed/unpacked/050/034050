Cases of the hand, foot and mouth (HFM) disease has shot past the 10 000
mark since the major outbreak 3 months ago. There are 10 091 cumulative
cases statewide, including 26 new cases reported yesterday [4 Jun 2006].
The 10 000 mark was breached on the first day of Gawai Dayak holiday
[celebrated in Sarawak on 1 June, is both a religious and social occasion]
on Thursday when 29 new cases were reported.
Eight of the new cases yesterday were detected in Miri Division, 7 in
Bintulu Division, 3 each in Samarahan, Sibu and Limbang Division, and 2 in
Kuching Division, Deputy Chief Minister Tan Sri Dr George Chan Hong Nam
said in a press statement.
He said there were 9 admissions, bringing the number of children still
warded in hospitals to 24, 10 of which are in the Sibu Hospital. Sibu
Division still has the highest number of cumulative cases at 2436, followed
by Miri Division (1800), Kuching Division (1300), Bintulu Division (1264)
and Sarikei Division (907).
Ten children have died of the disease. The last victim was a 6-year-old
girl, who died in Miri on May 6.
At the height of the previous outbreak, the Health Ministry ordered the
closure of all 488 kindergartens on 3 Mar 2006 to stop the spread of the
disease.
