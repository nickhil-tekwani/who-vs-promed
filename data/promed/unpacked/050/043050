European Network on Imported Infectious Disease Surveillance (TropNetEurop)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The major objective of this network is to establish the European Network on
Imported Infectious Disease Surveillance (TropNetEurop), an electronic
network of clinical sites related to imported infectious diseases in order
to effectively detect emerging infections of potential regional, national or
global impact at their point of entry into the domestic population.
At each participating TropNetEurop site, specific surveillance projects are
carried out using a standardised computerised reporting system. Weekly
transmission of anonymized patient and laboratory data to the central
database assure timely detection of sentinel events. Feedback is given to
all members in a monthly report that concentrates on specific topics.
After the introductory phase that is ongoing since February 1999,
TropNetEurop will serve as convenient tool to alert Public Health
authorities and trigger further cluster investigation. The comprehensive
collection of data on notifiable and, more importantly, not-notifiable
infectious diseases in travellers will make it possible to identify needs
for further surveillance and investigation and will provide the potential
for future case-control studies by identification of specific risk factors.
Furthermore, advantages and hidden pitfalls of the currently used systems of
notifiable diseases in Europe could be evaluated by TropNetEurop.
The network will eventually be sufficiently comprehensive to detect
unexpected events and flexible enough to allow inclusion of new surveillance
parameters with only minor modifications. Participating TropNetEurop sites
will be expected to be comprehensive in patient evaluation and in the
surveillance data supplied within normal clinical practice parameters.
Subsequent initiation of specific research projects may be initiated by the
co-ordinating site or by participating sites themselves. However, the
distinction between surveillance that is the primary priority of
TropNetEurop and the ensuing research related scientific questions will need
to be kept in mind by all participants.
TropNetEurop consists of a number [presently 28] of regularly reporting
sites that benefit from the data analysis and provide occasional reports on
unexpected events. It is anticipated that the network will grow constantly
and that the number of regularly reporting sites will increase during the
first years. The sizeable sample of travellers (term as used in this
proposal includes immigrants and foreign visitors) with a wide range of
exposures in high risk situations that can be screened by the network
reflects sentinel events on a global scale.
The initiative has been elected an official project of TropMedEurop, the
collaborating body of all tropical medicine institutions in Europe.
Furthermore, active collaboration with the International Society of Travel
Medicine and the Centers of Disease Control [& Prevention, USA] has been
established; communication with EC and WHO is pending.
In summary, the objectives and expected achievements of TropNetEurop are:
1. to identify emerging pathogens of public health importance by sampling
returning international travellers, immigrants, and foreign visitors;
2. to identify trends in specific infectious agents, risk factors, clinical
outcomes, and microbial resistance patterns in this population;
3. to develop innovative, efficient, and effective data collection and
analysis methods for the rapid identification of emerging infectious
diseases;
4. to develop strategies for the delivery of information on relevant public
health prevention and containment measures to practitioners, to governmental
bodies, and to the public,
5. to provide grounds for cluster investigation and intervention strategies
by Public Health authorities, and
6. to foster epidemiological and clinical teaching of infectious diseases
within Europe and to assist the international exchange of data and research
on emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases.

Rep., Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain,
Sweden, Switzerland, & the UK.]
ProMED-mail welcomes this initiative, which is -- like ProMED-mail -- still
in search of funding. Hopefully it will improve the identification of the
sources of imported diseases, and the speed of alerting the general public,
which are two of the objectives of ProMED-mail. - Mod.JW]
