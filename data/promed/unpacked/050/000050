Destruction of PNG potato industry hits economy
-----------------------------------------------
A fresh food supplier in Papua New Guinea (PNG) says more than 300 000
potato farmers have been affected by a potato disease that swept the
country 5 years ago.

The general manager of Alele Fresh Produce in Lae, Graeme Ross, says PNG's
potato industry was once worth USD 40 million to the local economy. It is
now struggling to stay alive after a deadly potato blight.

Mr Ross says 300 000 farmers have lost their livelihoods and this has had a
flow-on effect to other industries, including food and the food services
industry.

[Potato late blight (PLB) is caused by the fungus _Phytophthora infestans_,
which can also infect other solanaceous crops such as tomato or eggplant.
It can cause a total crop loss within a few days, and up to 25 per cent of
the worldwide potato crop is lost every year to this pathogen alone. New
more virulent strains are evolving constantly and simultaneously in all
potato growing regions. There is a high risk of spread with seed potatoes,
and PLB is considered a global threat. For more information on PLB see
ProMED-mail post no. 20080121.0256 (and other recent PLB posts in the
archives), and links listed below.

PLB wiped out most of the crop's seed base in PNG. Although the national
Fresh Produce Development Agency [FPDA] earlier this year forecast a full
recovery of the industry for 2008 (ProMED-mail post no. 20080121.0256),
unfortunately this does not appear to have occurred.
