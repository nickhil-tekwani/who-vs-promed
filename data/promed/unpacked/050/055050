[Bama is one of 13 departments in the province of Houet: see: https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houet

Although their report to OIE in Paris indicates that this is a "recurrence", the reports to OIE for the last 10 years do not list Houet Province as being afflicted. That so many animals were affected, 70, and died suggests that the local authorities did not know what the problem was and effective veterinary interaction and control was delayed. - Mod.MHJ
