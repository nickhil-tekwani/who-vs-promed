Liberia: Lassa fever returns as health sector crumbles
-------------------------------------------------------------
Liberia's almost non-existent health and sanitation infrastructure
was again brought into sharp focus this week as officials confirmed
that Lassa fever, [caused by] a virus transmitted by rats usually
found in areas with poor sanitation, is endemic for the 2nd time in 6
months in 3 Liberian counties [Lassa fever virus is endemic
continuously in _Mastomys_ rodents. Cases in humans occur
sporadically, as in this situation. - Mod.TY]
Liberia, which experienced a devastating 14-year civil war that ended
in 2003, last registered Lassa fever outbreaks in September [2006],
mostly in Nimba County. Health officials said at the time they did
not have the capacity to diagnose or treat the deadly disease but the
outbreak ended after the Chinese Embassy stepped in with funds for
medicines and testing kits.
Mildred Wesseh, a Ministry of Health spokesperson, told the
Integrated Regional Information Networks (IRIN) on Wednesday [11 Apr
2007] that the ministry has now confirmed a further 13 cases in Nimba
County, close to the border with Guinea and Cote d'Ivoire. Cases have
also been reported in Bong County (central Liberia) and Lofa (north),
according to the Health Ministry.
"We are very concerned about the active circulation of Lassa fever
[virus] and are now putting in place mechanisms to deal with the
disease, especially in the affected areas," Wesseh said.
She said 5 people suspected of having the disease died, but health
authorities had not confirmed whether the cause of death was Lassa.
Some 21 suspected cases have been reported but only 13 were
confirmed, and those who were currently infected with Lassa [virus]
were being given medication, she said.
Lassa is a viral haemorrhagic fever known to be endemic in Liberia,
Guinea, Sierra Leone and parts of Nigeria. It probably exists in
other West African countries as well, according to the World Health
Organisation (WHO).
Humans become infected with Lassa from contact with infected rodents.
The virus can also be transmitted from one human to another through
direct contact with body fluids. Rural dwellers, especially those
living in areas of poor sanitation or crowded living conditions, are
at greatest risk of contracting the illness, WHO says.
According to Liberia's Human Development Report (2006), by the end of
the country's civil war 95 percent of health facilities had been
destroyed and just 20 trained Liberian doctors were left in the
country, while the United Nations children's agency (UNICEF)
estimated in September 2006 that just 7 percent of people in rural
areas have access to clean drinking water.
The UN this week appealed for an additional USD 117 million in donor
assistance for Liberia to help rebuild basic social services. It
estimated that 70 percent of health facilities in the country were
still being run by international nongovernmental organisations.

[The tragic effects that civil war can have on health services, with
the resulting difficulty that public health officials in controlling
outbreaks and treating infected patients, is vividly illustrated in
this situation. Reducing rodent-human contact through improved
hygiene will be a goal difficult to achieve given the difficult
situation that Liberia faces in the aftermath of the war. ProMED
thanks A-Lan Banks for providing this same news release.
