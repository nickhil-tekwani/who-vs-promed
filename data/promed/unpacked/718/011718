UK GOVERNMENT: Exotic pet owners warned over salmonella risk
The Chief Medical Officer for England, Professor Liam Donaldson, today
issued a warning to the owners of snakes, lizards, terrapins and other
reptiles about the risk of contracting salmonellae from their pets.
Professor Donaldson is advising those with an increased risk of infection
from salmonellae to avoid contact with pet reptiles. This includes children
under five years old, pregnant women, the elderly and those with impaired
immunity.
The warning has been issued after laboratory figures showed a recent
increase in the number of cases of salmonell[osis associated with exotic
pets in children and infants. In December, a three-week-old baby has died
after apparently contracting the disease from the family's pet lizard and
five other children have contracted salmonell[osis as a result of contact
with pet reptiles in the last six months. An adult also contracted the
disease. In the last two years 13 people [in the UK have contracted
salmonell[osis from pet reptiles.
Nine out of ten reptiles shed salmonellae in their faeces and attempts to
treat reptiles to eliminate salmonellae have proven ineffective.
There has been a huge increase in the number of exotic animals sold in
Britain over the last ten years and it is estimated that tens of thousands
are now kept as pets.
Professor Liam Donaldson, Chief Medical Officer for England said:
"Thousands of reptiles are now kept as pets and it is important that their
owners are made aware of the potential health risks associated with these
animals. It is estimated that nine out of ten reptiles carry salmonellae
and people must take precautions if they own these exotic pets.
To avoid possible risk of infection, the Chief Medical Officer has issued
the following advice:
People at increased risk of infection or at risk from serious complications
of salmonellosis should avoid contact with reptiles. This includes children
less than 5 years old, pregnant women, the elderly and those with impaired
immunity.
Infants under one year old are at particular risk from direct and indirect
contact with reptiles.
Always wash hands with hot, soapy water after handling reptiles, reptile
cages and equipment and stools from reptiles. Children should be supervised
whilst handling reptiles to prevent hand to mouth contact.
Reptiles should be kept out of food preparation areas. Kitchen sinks should
not be used to bathe reptiles or wash reptile dishes, cages or aquariums.
If bath tubs are used for these purposes, they should be cleaned thoroughly
and disinfected with bleach. Consider keeping reptiles confined or limiting
the parts of the house where they are allowed to roam free.
Do not eat, drink or smoke whilst handling reptiles or their equipment.

Notes:
-- In Decemebr 1999, a three week old baby developed _Salmonella_
meningitis and died. Isolates from Margate General Hospital and St.
Thomas's Hospital have been identified as _Salmonella rubislaw_ by the PHLS
Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens. It is thought that the baby contracted
this rare strain of salmonella from the family's pet water dragon as
salmonellae isolated from its drinking water and a piece of wood from its
cage have been identified as _S. rubislaw_.
-- Most _Salmonella_ infections from reptiles in humans are mild
self-limiting illnesses characterised by diarrhoea, fever, and abdominal
cramps. However, severe and sometimes fatal illnesses are possible and more
likely to occur in infants and individuals with a compromised immune
system. Often these infections are invasive, leading to complications such
as _Salmonella_ meningitis and septicaemia.
-- PHLS Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens reports that there have been six
cases (five children and one adult) of infections acquired from reptiles
since July 1999.
-- In the USA reptiles are now recognised as an important public health
hazard. In 1996 an estimated 7.3 million reptiles were owned and
approximately 93 000 cases of _Salmonella_ infections are now attributable
to reptile of amphibian contact in the USA.

[The US Centers for Disease Control estimates are included in the first
ProMED-mail reference cited above. It appears that pet reptiles are a very
serious source of _Salmonella_ infections. Commercial distribution of
small pet turtles was banned in the USA some time ago for just that cause,
and I see no reason not to extend the ban to other reptiles in the interest
of public health. - Mod.ES
