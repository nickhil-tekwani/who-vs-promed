[As commented by Mod. JW in the last ProMED-mail posting on plague in
Mongolia (Plague - Mongolia 20020919.5361), these cases have no
implications for international travel; they are reported by ProMED-mail as
a reminder that plague foci are still present in the world. Plague is
endemic in Mongolia, and human cases of bubonic plague are reported every
year, mainly in country dwellers who have been hunting marmots for
their fur. Marmots are large, burrowing rodents similar to groundhogs
(woodchucks) in the USA. Most of the world's plague cases are reported
from Africa - Mod.LL]
