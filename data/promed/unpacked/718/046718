The total number of people sickened with listeriosis linked to ricotta [salata] cheese from a New York cheese importer has risen from 14 to 15, with a new illness reported in Washington State, according to the outbreak update issued by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday [21 Sep 2012]. [A picture of the package label for the incriminated cheese is available at http://www.foodsafetynews.com/RicottaRecallMain.jpg.]

The total number of cases by state is as follows: California (1), Colorado (1), District of Columbia (1), Maryland (3), Minnesota (1), Nebraska (1), New Jersey (1), New Mexico (1), New York (1), Ohio (1), Pennsylvania (1), Virginia (1) and Washington (1). [A map of cases by state is available at http://www.foodsafetynews.com/RicottaMap.jpg.]

All 15 victims have been hospitalized as a result of their infections, according to CDC. Three deaths have occurred, one each in Minnesota, Nebraska and New York. These deaths were reported by CDC in its initial outbreak report on 11 Sep 2012. The 1st illness connected to this outbreak began on 25 Mar 2012, and illness onsets have been recorded as recently as 26 Aug 2012.

Forever Cheese of Long Island City, NY, which imports the recalled cheese, has also announced that it will no longer be importing cheese made by Fattorie Chiarappa Srl, the company whose ricotta is now linked to the multistate listeriosis outbreak. "Forever Cheese has decided to stop importing and selling all products produced by Fattorie Chiarappa Srl," the firm said last week. Brands including Ricotta Salata Frescolina, the brand linked to this outbreak; Marte brand Roasted Ricotta and Hard Ricotta Salata will be discontinued immediately, said the company.

Health officials note that the affected cheese may also have been labeled as Ricotta Frescolina Marte Tipo Toscanella and/or Ricotta Salata Soft Lot (T9425) as it was being distributed.

Consumers who may have purchased the affected cheeses should not eat them and should discard them. This warning is especially important for pregnant women, people with weakened immune systems, and older adults, warns FDA, as people in these categories risk more serious infections from _Listeria monocytogenes_.

Symptoms of _Listeria_ infection, or listeriosis, usually include fever, chills, severe headache, vomiting, and other influenza-type symptoms. The CDC notes that infected individuals may develop fever, muscle aches, and sometimes gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea or diarrhea. If you think you may have contracted listeriosis, contact your healthcare provider.

[The total number of cases in a multistate outbreak of listeriosis linked to consumption of tainted ricotta salata cheese has risen from 14 to 15, and the number of states and District of Columbia with cases has risen from 12 to 13 since the last ProMED-mail post (Listeriosis - USA (02): (multistate) fatal, cheese, recall 20120912.1292100). The number of deaths has remained at 3.

The U.S. CDC has reported on the results of the outbreak investigation, which is available at http://www.cdc.gov/listeria/outbreaks/cheese-09-12/index.html:

- DNA "fingerprints," i.e., genotyping, of _Listeria_ have been used to identify cases of illness that are linked to this outbreak;
- A time line for the occurrence of cases ("epi curve") is available at http://www.cdc.gov/listeria/outbreaks/cheese-09-12/epi.html;
- 4 of the illnesses were related to a pregnancy;
- 2 of these illnesses were diagnosed in newborns;
- the other 11 ill persons range in age from 30 years to 87 years, with a median age of 77 years;
- 64 percent of them are female;
- no fetal losses have been reported;
- listeriosis contributed 2 of the 3 deaths;
- 12 (86 percent) of 14 ill persons interviewed reported consuming a soft cheese. All 6 ill persons who could provide information about packaging of cheeses reported consuming cheese that had been cut and repackaged at a retail location;
- no one cheese was reported by the majority of ill persons, suggesting that cross-contamination of other cheeses through cutting boards and utensils may have played a role (The investigation has focused on identifying intact cheeses shipped to multiple retail locations where ill persons purchased cut and repackaged cheese.);
- FDA identified the outbreak strain of _Listeria monocytogenes_ bacteria in a sample of uncut imported Marte brand Frescolina ricotta salata cheese distributed by Forever Cheese, Inc., lot number (T9425) and/or a production code (441202) that has been recalled;
- Forever Cheese has expanded the original recall to include all lots and all production codes of Marte Brand Frescolina Ricotta Salata cheese;
- FDA is working closely with CDC, the firm involved, and public health authorities in states where illnesses occurred to determine the exact cause of contamination.
