Wheat disease making comeback
-----------------------------
One of Australia's earliest wheat diseases is re-emerging on the Eyre
Peninsula. Flag Smut was first described in 1868 with the fungus
producing grey-black lines of spores. South Australian Research and
Development Institute [SARDI] pathologist Dr Hugh Wallwork says the
fungus is being detected in crops near Cowell and Cleve.

Dr Wallwork says traditionally the fungus has been controlled by the
use of treated seed. "In the early part of the century it was the
most damaging disease of wheat ... it really is a disease that is
completely controlled with good, effective use of seed treatments,"
he said. "The problem we've had this year [2008] is that because of
the drought and costs of inputs, people have been cutting back on
using some seed treatments."

[Flag smut of wheat is caused by the fungus _Urocystis agropyri_. The
disease is known to infect wheat and many grass species but the
strain(s) that affect wheat are specific to wheat. It occurs in some
European countries, Australia, Canada and the USA. Since
susceptibility varies with wheat cultivars the disease may not cause
major yield losses, but it can have a serious impact on export trade.
Many nations have quarantine restrictions prohibiting the importation
of wheat products from countries with the disease.

Affected plants are severely stunted. Excessive tillering is common
and often the ears fail to emerge, remaining within the boot. Plants
show long dark grey to black streaks on the leaf blades and leaf
sheaths. The streaks eventually erupt so leaves become ragged and the
black spores are exposed giving the plant an appearance of being
covered in soot. Spores are wind dispersed and can drop onto the soil
where they are very persistent surviving up to 4 years. Disease
management may include cultural practices, but systemic chemical seed
treatment is the most effective means of controlling the disease.

The re-emergence of this disease in South Australia shows the
importance of retaining disease management practices despite
difficult economic circumstances.
