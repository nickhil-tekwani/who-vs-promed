A 52-year-old farmer may be the 1st human diagnosed with West Nile [virus infection] in Brazil, according to the state Secretariat of Health (SESAPI).

The victim, who is not identified, was hospitalized for 20 days in the Nathan Portela Infectious Diseases Hospital in Teresina and was released this past Mon 29 Sep 2014.

According to SESAPI, an initial test confirmed that the patient was infected with this virus, and a new test was requested to confirm the [etiology] of the disease.

Specialists of the Ministry of Health and the Evandro Chagas Institute this Saturday (26 [Sep 2914]) were in Teresina and confirmed that the case [occurred].

According to the SESAPI Director of Heath Surveillance, Telma Evangelista, the farmer is paralyzed with symptoms of high fever, tremors, headache, meningitis and diarrhea.

The patient worked as a farmer on a farm of a veterinarian in a rural area of Itainopolis, in southern Piaui. When he began to have symptoms, he went to the health unit in the city where he lived and was later sent to the Emergency Hospital in Teresina. "Only after we know more about the case -- he was taken to the Nathan Portela Hospital where he was diagnosed with encephalitis -- and we have confirmation by the 2nd test will this be the 1st [confirmed] case of human West Nile virus [infection] in Brazil," she said.

Telma Evangelista stated that since the farmer has direct contact with animals, SESAPI technicians collected mosquitoes and animal blood samples in the area where he worked. "We collected samples, especially from horses, since horses are more likely to be infected and pass the virus in blood to mosquitoes. By being bitten [by infected mosquitoes], humans contract the disease [infection]," she explained [In general, mammals, including horses, are dead-end hosts for West Nile virus. Although they are susceptible to infection by the virus and may develop severe neurological disease, their viremias are not of sufficient amplitude to infect mosquito vectors. Birds are amplifying hosts. - Mod.TY].

There is no [specific] treatment nor a vaccine available for humans. For severe cases, hospitalization is required due to the need for intensive therapy, intravenous fluid replacement, airway management, prevention of secondary infections among other [considerations]. Treatment is symptomatic, just addressing the symptoms that the patient is suffering.

[There is serological evidence of West Nile virus infections in equine animals in the Pantanal of Brazil. The Pantanal region in southern Brazil is a stopping place for migratory birds but is far distant from the state of Piaui in the northeast of the country. The virus [WNV] was found in Argentina in Cordoba and Choco provinces (in horses [and in one human case (see ProMED-mail archive no 20061228.3642)], indicating that there has been active WNV transmission in a broad geographic area in South America. However, the serological results in the Pantanal study should be interpreted with caution because of antigenic cross reactions among members of this flavivirus family. If the Piaui case is confirmed by the additional tests, it will expand the known geographic range of WNV transmission in Brazil and in South America. Additional studies of the presence of WNV in the area where the case occurred would be of interest.
