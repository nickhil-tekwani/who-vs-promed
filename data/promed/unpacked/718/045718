Russia's Altai region in West Siberia has had an anthrax outbreak, said the country's food safety watchdog, known as Rosselkhoznadzor.

A man was diagnosed with anthrax after slaughtering a cow in the village of Bystry Istok in mid-October 2012, Rosselkhoznadzor said in an e-mailed statement today [7 Nov 2012]. The cow might have been infected with anthrax spores at a local pasture, the service said. No other animals or people in the area have infection symptoms yet. The last anthrax case in the village area was in 1964, Rosselkhoznadzor said.

[A routine outbreak in many ways, except that it is a mite late in the season for a grazing source. Frosts would have started in early October, and stock will have been housed for the winter, certainly overnight. While many photographs of the Altai are of the mountains, this village is most likely in the foothills and ecologically identical with close by eastern Kazakhstan and northwestern Mongolia and would thus share the same strains of _B. anthracis_.

Also, it would appear that the previous outbreaks this summer [2012] in the Altai region did not result in the livestock in Bystry Istok getting vaccinated. Of if they were, it was ineffective.

Altai is a vast mountainous area, located in the center of Eurasia at the juncture of China, Kazakhstan, Mongolia and Russia. The Russian part of Altai includes the Altai region (Barnaul is the central city) and the Republic of Altai (Gorno-Altaisk is the capital); see:
