The California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) confirmed on [3 Oct 2019] a Shasta County horse tested positive for the neurologic form of equine herpesvirus (EHV-1) and that 4 horses were exposed.

The positive horse, a 20-year-old Quarter Horse gelding, was quarantined and isolated along with the other exposed horses on its premises. All are under quarantine with enhanced biosecurity protocols, including twice-daily temperature monitoring.

The affected horse attended an event at the Rolling Hills Casino Equestrian Center from [27-29 Sep 2019]. Subsequent to his positive test, stabling there has been thoroughly cleaned and disinfected, and the event's sponsoring organization is notifying membership of the possible exposure.

The CDFA recommends isolating horses having participated in the event, monitoring and recording their temperatures twice a day, and contacting a veterinarian for possible nasal swab and blood sampling if horses display clinical signs of EHV or have a temperature above 101.5 deg F.

Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM; the neurologic form).

In many horses, the 1st or only sign of EHV-1 infection is fever, which can go undetected. In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months) but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following EHV-1 infection.

Horses with the neurologic form usually have a fever at disease onset and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

Herpesvirus spreads easily by nose-to-nose or close contact with an infectious horse; sharing contaminated equipment such as bits, buckets, and towels; or via clothing, hands, or equipment of people who have recently had contact with an infectious horse. Routine biosecurity measures, including hygiene and basic cleaning and disinfection practices, should be in place at all times to help prevent disease spread.

Current EHV-1 vaccines might reduce viral shedding but are not protective against the neurologic form of the disease. Implementing routine biosecurity practices is the best way to minimize viral spread, and the best method of disease control is prevention.

State veterinarian officials have confirmed the 1st case of horse herpes in Utah. The Utah Department of Agriculture and Food (UDAF) stated in a press release on Thursday [17 Oct 2019] that the 1st confirmed case of equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) has appeared in Utah this year [2019].

According to the UDAF, a Weber County horse tested positive sometime this week and has been quarantined. Prior to the diagnosis, other horses on the farm of origin were isolated from the infected horse and are currently being monitored for signs of illness, stated the UDAF.

The UDAF stated it's unknown at the time where the horse contracted EHV-1, but it did compete at barrel racing events on [2 Oct and 5 Oct 2019] at the Weber County Fairgrounds. The agency added any horses having attended these events are considered potentially exposed, and close monitoring, including twice-daily temperature readings, is advised. Any horses developing a fever or showing neurological signs should be isolated immediately, and owners should contact their veterinarian for advice and treatment.

"We're advising horse owners who have plans to attend events and competitions this season to practice diligent biosecurity," stated Dr. Chelsea Crawford, assistant state veterinarian. "Limit or avoid horse-to-horse contact and use of shared communal water sources as much as possible, and disinfect shared equipment in between horses."

[None of the available vaccines has a label claim to prevent the neurologic form of EHV-1 infection. It has been suggested vaccines may assist in limiting the spread of outbreaks of equine herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHM; equine herpes myeloencephalopathy/EHM is an alternative name for a neurologic disease associated with EHV) by limiting nasal shedding of EHV-1 and dissemination of infection. For this reason, some experts hold the opinion there may be an advantage to vaccinating in the face of an outbreak. If this approach is pursued, only afebrile and asymptomatic horses should be vaccinated, and protection against clinical EHM should not be an expectation. The vaccines with the greatest ability to limit nasal shedding and viremia of the neurovirulent strain include the vaccines licensed for control of abortion (Pneumabort-K and Prodigy) and the modified live vaccine (Rhinomune and Calvenza).
