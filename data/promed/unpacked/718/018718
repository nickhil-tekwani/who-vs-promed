Anthrax downs 50 Isabela villagers
----------------------------------
At least 50 people from a remote Isabela village in the Philippines
have been hospitalized for the last 4 weeks after partaking of
anthrax-contaminated carabao [water buffalo] meat.

According to reports, the victims, all residents of Dicamay 2 in
Jones, Isabela, exhibited signs of anthrax infection after consuming
meat of carabaos believed to have been downed by the dreaded animal
disease. In addition to the number of villagers affected, reports also
indicated that at least 6 carabaos have already died due to anthrax
since 16 Oct 2009, prompting the Isabela veterinary office to declare
an outbreak of anthrax in the entire village.

"Actually we can already declare an anthrax outbreak even if only one
carabao had died of the disease. Much more that, there were already 6
carabaos that have died of the said illness in the village," said
provincial veterinary officer Dr. Angelo Naui. "We had already ordered
the inoculation of all carabaos and other herbivorous animals in the
town and other nearby areas to prevent the further spread of the
disease," he said.

[Since 2005 the Philippine government has merely reported "Disease
present but without quantitative data." Traditionally Luzon is the
most severely afflicted island in the Philippines. If this outbreak
started on 16 Oct 2009 and carabao cases have continued, now including
some 50 villagers over the past 4 weeks, either the government
response has been dilatory or this livestock problem is more widely
dispersed in the Nueva Vizcaya area than they are willing to admit.
Either way it would seem that the control of this disease is
inadequate both from the veterinary and public health aspects.
