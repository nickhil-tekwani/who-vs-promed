The cholera epidemic in the northern Mozambican province of Nampula has now
spread to the district of Mozambique Island, where 17 cases have been
notified since last Wed, 29 Mar 2006, but so far with no deaths, reports
Monday's issue of the Maputo daily "Noticias". In the earlier stages of
the outbreak, cases of the disease had been reported in the districts of
Monapo, Meconta, and Malema. Since the start of the outbreak, a little over
2 weeks ago, Nampula has recorded 360 cases, with 8 deaths.
Commenting on the situation in Mozambique Island, Nampula provincial health
director Antonio Salimo lamented the difficulties the local health unit is
facing in finding space for cholera patients, and he promised to send a
number of beds for that purpose, and chlorine for the treatment of drinking
water.
Other provinces where cholera cases have been reported this year are
Sofala, Zambezia, and Manica, all in the central region of the country.
However, Manica has not diagnosed a single new case during the past week.
From Beira, the capital of Sofala, there are reports of another death by
cholera in the last 48 hours, which brings to 10 the Beira death toll
during this outbreak. The health authorities also said that a total of 23
new cases were diagnosed in Beira, and in the districts of Buzi, Dondo, and
Marromeu, over the last 2 days.

An outbreak of cholera has hit Komenda and its surrounding villages in the
Komenda-Edina-Eguafo-Abrem (KEEA) District of the Central Region. So far,
63 cases have been reported, with one person dead.
The outbreak began about 2 weeks ago, and nurses at the Komenda
Sub-District Health Centre continue to battle with the epidemic. The
affected areas included British and Dutch Komenda, Abransa, Antado and
Dominase, according to Mrs. Christiana Acheampong, Supt. Enrolled Nurse at
the health centre.
She disclosed that lack of potable drinking water, coupled with filth and
indiscriminate defecating were the main cause of the outbreak of the
disease. In the Komenda township, lack of potable water has forced the
residents to rely on a pond, which is located within it. Mrs. Acheampong
explained that filth also accounted for the outbreak of the epidemic
because people did not keep their environments clean. Most houses, she
noted, have no toilets in them, paving way for indiscriminate defecating.

Cholera has claimed a 5th victim in the Indian Ocean archipelago of
Zanzibar, increasing the fatality to 5 with 40 people having fallen prey to
the epidemic.
Zanzibar Health Minister Sultan Mohamed Mughery told local reporters on
Sun, 2 Apr 2006, that the latest victim had died in the Unguja Southern
Region. The official attributed the spread of the disease to poor
sanitation and polluted drinking water in the isles.
Of the infected, 30 are residents of Pemba island while the rest are
residents of Unguja island. Pemba and Unguja are the 2 main islands of the
archipelago.
Zanzibar experienced 2 severe eruptions of cholera in 1978 and 1999, when
hundreds of people died of the epidemic.

An international medical organization and camp committees are hardly
assisting to decrease the number of people who suffer from cholera in Htam
Him refugee camp located in the Ratchaburi Province of Thailand, said a
Karen Journalist who visited in the camp recently. [Unclear whether the
author meant "The medical organization and committees are working hard to
decrease..." or "...are barely able to decrease" - CopyEd.PG]
The camp committees and medical workers announced that about 13 people are
in serious condition, 50 people were taken to the hospital, and about 370
people suffer from cholera; but nobody has died so far.
"They [haven't been able to stop] the outbreak yet, and the patient numbers
are still increasing," said Keh Blut, a Journalist from Kwekalu Karen
Newspaper.
The camp committees educated the refugees about the disease from a
loudspeaker, encouraging them to drink [boiled] water and not to eat ripe
fruits to stop cholera in the camp.
A week ago just over 40 refugees were suffering; now the number has
increased to 370. "The crowded conditions in the camp make it easy for the
virus to spread," said a member of the camp committee.
Htam Him refugee camp was established in 1997 for refugees who fled the
armed conflict and human rights violations in southern Burma. A majority of
the refugees are of Karen ethnicity, and their homes are in various
mountain ranges and river banks in the Tenasserim Division of Burma. Other
ethnic minorities from Burma, Mon and Burman refugees, [all included among]
the UNHCR's Persons of Concern, have also taken refuge in the camp since
Mar 2005.
According to Karen Refugee Committee in March 2005, about 1583 refugee
families living in Htam Him camp rely on the International Rescue Committee
for health care.
