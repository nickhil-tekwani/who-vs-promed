Each year, more than 50 cases of leptospirosis are recorded in RÃ©union, the majority of them requiring hospitalization. Since the start of the year [2021], a significant increase in the number of reports has been observed with 74 cases of leptospirosis reported in 2021, including 35 cases in April [2021].

The rainy season is the period of greatest risk because it presents temperature and rainfall conditions favorable to the survival in the environment of the bacteria [_Leptospira_] responsible for this disease. Heavy rain episodes promote soil leaching and environmental contamination and are therefore particularly risky periods.

Leptospirosis is a serious disease caused by bacteria often found in rats and other rodents. The disease is contracted upon contact with a humid environment contaminated by the urine of these infected animals (sludge, puddles, stagnant water at the edge of gullies). The bacteria enter the body through the skin if there are cuts or wounds (even small ones). After a few days of incubation, leptospirosis manifests itself with the following symptoms (which can be easily mistaken for dengue or COVID-19 infection): sudden onset high fever (often higher than 38.5 deg C/101.3 deg F); muscle and joint pain; stomach pain, nausea, vomiting; and headache. The disease may get worse after a few days. If it is not treated in time with antibiotics, it can be fatal.

What are the risky activities?
The vast majority of cases recorded on the island are linked to the practice of gardening; freshwater leisure activities (fishing, swimming in rivers or pools, whitewater sports); and mainly in people with unprotected wounds or without sufficient protection (boots, gloves, glasses, wetsuit, etc.).

How to avoid leptospirosis?
Simple measures make it possible to effectively limit the risks of contamination:
- Individual protection measures: use suitable equipment (gloves, boots, overalls, etc.); protect and disinfect his wounds; postpone freshwater leisure activities in cloudy water; do not walk barefoot or in slippers in stagnant or muddy water.
- Fight against rats: regularly maintain your yard (no bulky items, waste conducive to the proliferation of rats, etc.); eliminate all sources of food (including animal feed scraps); respect the bathing restrictions in areas indicated as being at risk.

These preventive measures must be applied especially after periods of heavy rain because the risk of contact with contaminated wetlands is then greater. The surveillance of this disease is ensured by the ARS [regional health agency] and Public Health France and allows, after the reception of a report, to identify the potential sources of exposure and the activities at risk of the people who contracted the disease to better inform on the measures to be implemented.

[Leptospirosis is a zoonotic bacterial infection that is distributed widely throughout the world in warm climates and is transmitted to humans by direct contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes with the urine of infected animals or by contact with wet soil, vegetation, or water that has been contaminated with infected animal urine. _Leptospira_ bacteria shed in urine may survive in fresh water or moist soil for weeks to months. Many species of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rats) are susceptible to chronic kidney infection with pathogenic _Leptospira_. Different leptospiral serovars are prevalent in particular geographical regions. Inadequate disposal of trash and debris provides a suitable habitat for rat infestation in urban settings. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers. Reunion experiences seasonal outbreaks of leptospirosis probably related to the rainfall.

Reunion, one of the overseas departments of France, is an island with a population of about 800 000 located in the Indian Ocean, about 943 km (586 mi) east of Madagascar and about 200 km (120 mi) south west of Mauritius, the nearest island.
