The source of infection for the national outbreak of hepatitis A was probably imported, frozen raspberries. This is shown by the investigation that the Norwegian Food Safety Authority and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health have carried out in connection with the outbreak, which is now considered over. The outbreak of hepatitis A lasted from April to October 2021 and involved 20 infected people.

Tracing of the source shows that the raspberries are probably no longer on the market. The outbreak is therefore considered over, says senior adviser Heidi Lange at the National Institute of Public Health (NIPH). Of the 20 who are infected, 18 cases have been confirmed and 2 are probable. Most are well-adults, but the age range is from 10 to 80 years, and 65% are men.

The infected lived in different parts of the country:

Viken (9 cases)
Oslo (4 cases)
Vestfold and Telemark (3 cases)
Trondelag (2 cases)
More og Romsdal (1 case)
Inland (1 case)

The National Institute of Public Health's analyses of patient interviews and purchase information show that 18 out of 20 who became infected have eaten fresh or frozen berries of one type or another. Further research showed that half (10 of 20) had eaten frozen, imported raspberries from the same supplier 2-6 weeks prior to illness. The berries were used in various products such as cakes and stirred berries purchased from various bakeries and cafes.

The time from being infected with the hepatitis A virus to becoming ill can be up to 6 weeks. The long incubation period makes the work of identifying a common source of infection particularly complicated, and it can be difficult to remember what one has eaten so far back in time.

[Frozen berries have been implicated in hepatitis A transmission in the past. The exact mechanism of contamination of the berries is generally not clearly established, but hepatitis A is essentially only a human pathogen transmitted by the fecal-oral route. - Mod.LL
