After eating leftover food in his fridge, which triggered a potentially deadly disease, a 19-year-old student had to get both of his legs and all 10 fingers amputated. In a YouTube video posted by Chubbyemu, Bernard Hsu, a doctor and YouTube creator, details the results of a case from The New England Journal of Medicine, which was first reported in March 2021 [https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcpc2027093].

According to this study, a patient was admitted to the paediatric intensive care centre (PICU) "because of shock, multiple organ failure, and rash." His pain first started 20 hours before he was admitted and shortly after he "ate rice, chicken, and lo mein leftovers from a restaurant."

As noted in Hsu's video, this patient, who is referred to as JC, had fever, high blood pressure, and pale skin. After JC vomited, doctors noticed a "green-ish yellow colour, not looking like any particular kind of food." However, JC's abnormal breathing became an even greater concern, along with the dropping of his blood pressure. Once he was sedated, doctors saw changes in his skin. "Doctors started to notice a rash containing small spots emerging all over his body," Hsu explained. "At first, this mottled appearance looked like bruises, but then they became a deep reddish brown, red defined at the edges."

JC continued to get sicker and was then transported via helicopter to another hospital that had more resources. Following more blood and urine tests, JC was diagnosed with _Neisseria meningitidis_, which caused his stiff neck, nausea, respiratory collapse, shock, and multiorgan failure.

As noted by the Centers for Disease and Control Prevention (CDC), this condition, also known as meningococcal disease, is caused by bacteria, with symptoms like sudden fever and vomiting. It can also "lead to death in as little as a few hours". In regards to his skin changes, this was due to purpura fulminans, which [Hsu] said are purple rashes that can happen very suddenly. As noted by the Canadian Medical Association Journal, purpura fulminans can be a severe and rare result of meningococcal disease. And although he continued to stabilise, the infections on JC's body were so severe that he had to have all 10 of his fingers and both of his legs amputated.

Similar to JC, his roommate also threw up after eating the leftover food but he didn't react nearly as badly. The doctors then studied JC's medical history more to discover how he differed from his roommate. They learned that JC only received the 1st dose of the meningococcal vaccine just before he entered middle school. And once he reached the age of 16, JC did not receive the recommended booster for the vaccine. Per the CDC, a serogroup B meningococcal is then recommended between the age of 16 to 23. [Hsu] explained that this usually consists of 2 separate doses within a few months, and again, JC only got one dose. [CDC recommendations for the routine vaccination of adolescents with the meningococcal conjugate ACWY vaccine and serogroup B meningococcal or MenB vaccines can be found at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mening/hcp/recommendations.html. All 11 to 12-year-olds are recommended to receive a meningococcal conjugate ACWY vaccine. Since protection wanes, CDC recommends a booster dose at age 16 years. - Mod.ML]

[Hsu] also explained while it was clearly the leftover food that caused JC's symptoms, it remains unknown how traces of _N. meningitidis_ got into it. Luckily, JC is doing much better and his condition is improving. As noted by WebMD, bacteria can quickly grow on leftover food when stored at room temperature. However, it isn't clear where JC kept his meal before eating it. The medical site notes that food should be put in the fridge or freezer within 2 hours after it's "been cooked or taken off a heat source." While it can depend on what kind of food you're eating, leftovers can be "kept for 3 to 4 days in the refrigerator," according to Mayo Clinic.

Bendapudi PK, Whalen MJ, Lahoud-Rahme M, Villalba JA. Case 7-2021: A 19-Year-Old Man with Shock, Multiple Organ Failure, and Rash. N Engl J Med. 2021; 384(10): 953-963; https://doi.org/10.1056/nejmcpc2027093

This 19-year-old college student was hospitalized because of shock, multiple organ failure, and a rash that rapidly evolved into purpura fulminans, that is, rapidly progressing cutaneous hemorrhage and necrosis, with severe thrombotic consumptive coagulopathy. This condition is commonly due to _Neisseria meningitidis_. Blood cultures obtained on admission before the administration of antimicrobial therapy grew meningococci, serogroup C, susceptible to ceftriaxone, which the patient received about 40 minutes after admission. Subsequent blood cultures were negative. He developed many complications of fulminant meningococcemia, including necrosis of the arms and legs, which led to amputations of parts of all 10 fingers and bilateral below-knee amputations. It was later learned that this patient had received only one dose of the meningococcal conjugate ACWY vaccine, without a subsequent booster, and one dose of the meningococcal serogroup B vaccine. These vaccines are serogroup-specific, so the serogroup B vaccine would not be helpful against serogroup C disease.

_N. meningitidis_ infects only humans, not other animals. The human nasopharyngeal mucosa is the natural reservoir for _N. meningitidis_, an encapsulated Gram-negative bacterium. Only 6 of the 13 serogroups (A, B, C, W, X, and Y) and relatively few genotypes, called "hyperinvasive lineages," are responsible for most invasive disease; these disease-causing meningococci belong to particular groups of related genotypes, termed "clonal complexes" (https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/191/8/1263/859453).

This organism colonizes via attachment of its surface filamentous processes (pili) to epithelial cells in the nasopharynx. Shortly after colonization, pathogenic meningococci pass through the epithelial barrier and enter the blood stream, where they can multiply causing meningococcal septicemia (meningococcemia) and disseminated disease (such as pneumonia, septic arthritis, and meningitis), with a case fatality rate of about 10-15%, even with appropriate antibiotic therapy (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/mening.html). Meningococcemia may occur with or without meningitis.

Infants less than one year old, adolescents and young adults 16 through 23 years old, and adults over 85 years of age have higher rates of disease than other age groups. Host predisposing factors also include lack of circulating protective bactericidal antibodies, defects in the complement system, functional or anatomic asplenia, and HIV infection. People who receive complement inhibitors (such as eculizumab [Soliris(R)], ravulizumab [Ultomiris(TM)]) are also at increased risk for meningococcal disease, as are household and other close contacts.

In contrast to the limited number of strains of meningococci capable of causing disease, the nasopharynx of 10-35% of normal young adults are colonized by a genetically diverse group of meningococci, without causing invasive disease (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2719693/).

Person-to-person transmission of meningococci occurs through inhalation of large airborne respiratory droplets shed from the upper respiratory tract or direct contact with oropharygeal secretions through sharing of drinks or intimate kissing. Transfer via contaminated fomites has been postulated but is considered rare, because meningococci do not survive for long outside the human body.

The time between exposure to the organism and onset of symptoms (the incubation period) is usually 2-10 days. Because the patient in the news report above fell ill so soon after eating leftover food, foodborne transmission of meningococcal disease, for this and other reasons, is very unlikely in this patient. College campuses are often sites for outbreaks of meningococcal disease and people who have close or lengthy contact with a patient with meningococcal disease, such as a roommate, are at increased risk for transmission, which are reasons to vaccinate incoming college students who have communal living arrangements (such as residence halls) against this disease. - Mod.ML
