--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following article dated 12 May 2021 specifies that [an 11-month-old's] group A Strep infection was 2 years ago and that the Murdoch Children's Research Institute is about to start trialling Group A Strep vaccines.
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9569055/Melbourne-mother-reveals-baby-daughter-nearly-lost-leg-Strep-A.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490

The article cited in the earlier ProMED report (https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/health-problems/melbourne-toddler-almost-loses-her-leg-to-strep-a-as-vaccines-are-trialled/news-story/904575ab69302578b6c0f4b2893f846f) combined [the 11-month-old's] story with a video captioned, "An alert has been issued after 3 suburbs in Melbourne recorded cases of a flesh-eating skin disease."

The video is linked with another article dated 24 Feb 2021, discussing Buruli ulcer in Melbourne. See https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/health-problems/flesheating-skin-infection-found-in-inner-melbourne-for-the-first-time/news-story/52b7a12e6f1ddab7cbcea1522e2d870b.

It appears that the Buruli ulcer story and group A strep stories may have been combined to suggest an outbreak.

[ProMED thanks the discerning reader for alerting us to the apparent conflation in the news article used in the initial posting of "flesh-eating infection' due to group A streptococci in an 11-month old child, with "flesh-eating infections" due to _Mycobacterium ulcerans_ (aka Buruli ulcers) that are occurring in the Melbourne region. The "flesh-eating infection' in the 11-month old actually occurred 2 years ago, considering that she is now 3-years-old. There apparently is no "alert" that "has been issued after 3 suburbs in Melbourne recorded cases of flesh-eating skin disease", as reported in the news article cited in the earlier ProMED report, due to group A streptococci.

ProMED-mail has been posting reports on the increasing incidence of Buruli ulcers in communities surrounding the city of Melbourne in the Australian state of Victoria. Please see prior ProMED-mail posts on Buruli ulcer below. - Mod.ML
