Rodent plague threatens ferrets
-------------------------------
The area of plague-infected black-tailed prairie dogs has more than
doubled in western South Dakota since mid-May [2008], and the disease
could begin to seriously hurt the state's population of endangered
black-footed ferrets. Plague is almost always fatal to infected
prairie dogs and has killed a large number of the rodents, wildlife
experts said. Black-footed ferrets hunt and dine almost exclusively
on prairie dogs.

"When ferrets eat an infected prairie dog, they'll get a massive
dose" of plague, said Kevin Atchley, Wall District ranger for the
U.S. Forest Service. "It's likely that some ferrets have perished."

The infected area has bloomed from 4000 acres to 9100 acres as of
last week [1 - 4 Jul 2008], Atchley said. The infected area is within
the 300 000-acre Conata Basin south of Wall, SD.

Plague is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium _Yersinia
pestis_. The disease, also known as bubonic plague, spread through
the West after it appeared in San Francisco in 1902. It was 1st
detected in South Dakota wildlife in western Custer County in 2004.

The disease is mainly spread through wildlife populations -- coyotes
being a favored traveling host -- by infected fleas that transmit the
disease through their bite.

In late May [2008], workers with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
the U.S. Forest Service, the National Park Service and the U.S.
Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service began dusting prairie dog towns with insecticide to kill the
fleas but keep the ferret's preferred food source alive.

The insecticide, similar to what is given to dogs and cats to control
fleas, is released via a wand sprayer from a tank mounted on an
all-terrain vehicle. Workers stick the wand down each burrow entrance
to release the dust. As the prairie dogs enter and exit, the dust is
rubbed into the fur and kills the fleas. As of last week, workers
dusted 2440 acres of prairie dog towns, including 700 acres within
Badlands National Park.

"We've dusted specific areas to hold onto our good, productive ferret
areas," said Scott Larson, spokesman for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service in Pierre, SD. "We think it's taken out a lot of the prairie
dog population, and a lot of that (area) is occupied by ferrets."

"We'll spray one-third of the colonies to protect two-thirds of the
ferret population," Atchley said.

The plague is headed toward Badlands National Park.

"We're anticipating that it'll be in our prairie dog towns," said
Brian Kenner, chief of resource management for the park. "I don't
think there's any way to stop it. We don't have a strategy to stop
it. It can jump pretty far."

Dusting also will be done along Highway 44 and Conata Basin Road as a
precaution against a transfer to people. Transmission between
wildlife and humans is rare, but it is possible. There has never been
a case of human plague reported in South Dakota, said state
epidemiologist Dr. Lon Kightlinger.

Still, signs have been posted along Highway 44 in the Conata Basin
and Badlands National Park, warning visitors of the threat. The
bright yellow signs advise people to stay in their vehicle -- and
keep their pets inside the vehicle as well -- around prairie dog villages.

Visitors don't seem to be worried.

"Very few people have expressed a concern about it," said Judy Olson,
chief of interpretation for the park.

Yet the threat remains for the black-footed ferret, once thought to
be extinct but now representing one of the most successful
reintroduction efforts of wild animals back into a species'
historical range. For the black-footed ferret, that range included
grassland habitats in 12 U.S. states, two Canadian provinces and
possibly northern Mexico.

The last wild ferrets -- Fish and Wildlife Service officials called
them the rarest 18 mammals on Earth -- were captured in Wyoming in
1987 to begin the breeding and reintroduction program. There are an
estimated 600 to 800 ferrets now living at 15 reintroduction sites.

About 300 ferrets live within the Conata Basin -- considered by
wildlife advocates to be the most successful of all the sites.

But the outbreak could hamper future release efforts in western South Dakota.

"We're very concerned," Larson said. "That's why we're out there with
the other agencies to put down that dust."

It has taken a little less than a year for this disease to reach the
Conata Basin. Prairie dogs are often sentinel animals for this
disease. A photo of a prairie dog may be seen at:

The causative bacterium, _Yersinia pestis_, is transmitted to people
through fleabite and direct contact with infected animals. Each
rodent species is host to one or more species of flea, which, when
infected, is a carrier. These fleas generally do not infest other
animals unless their natural hosts are unavailable. Rock squirrels
(_Spermophilus variegatus_) are closely related to California ground
squirrels and are the most significant plague host in Colorado. Their
principal flea (_Diamanus montanus_) is an aggressive parasite and
will readily bite other animals and people. Domestic cats and dogs
can also contract plague by infective fleas. They may carry infected
fleas home to their owners or, especially with cats, serve as a
direct source of infection.
