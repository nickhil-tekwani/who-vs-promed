A suspected case of Ebola [virus disease, EVD] was recorded in a village bordering Liberia with the Ivory Coast, said the Ivorian Ministry of Health on Wednesday [23 Jul 2014] in Abidjan, calling on Ivorians to be vigilant against "a very high risk" of disease spread. "A suspected case of EVD was recorded in a village in Liberia which borders Cote d'Ivoire," the ministry said in a statement.

The department is asking people in border villages in Liberia and Guinea, where the virus occurs, to "remain vigilant" against the "very high risk" of spreading the disease. He calls on them to inform emergency health services of any issue of "general signs of EVD including fever [with] headache and bleeding."

The Ivorian government recently expelled 400 of its nationals from Liberia, who wanted to return home with UNHCR [UN High Commissioner for Refugees] assistance under the voluntary return of refugees from the post-election crisis of 2010-2011.

Ministry deserves kudos for Ebola preparedness
----------------------------------------------
At least assurance has been made by the [Tanzania] Health and Social Welfare ministry that it is taking all necessary measures to see that Ebola [virus disease, EVD], the deadly disease that has recently killed many West Africans, does not wreck havoc if it happens to creep into the country.

Although no patient has been diagnosed with the disease [in Tanzania], we are informed that the government has set up response centres across the country and has also dispatched, among other things, materials and equipment to all regional medical officers (RMOs) to ensure efficient detection and response. As for Dar es Salaam, Amana Hospital with about 350 workers of various cadres, has been closed and will now serve as an EVD response centre.

Besides, the ministry has already sent instructions to all RMOs and equipped them with detailed information on the disease's symptoms and ways to go about tackling it. It has gone further by making available protective gear to all physicians to protect themselves from the disease when attending to the patients. Working with epidemiologists, the government is now conducting screening sessions at all points of entry to the country including land, sea and airports.

We are told that EVD is the human disease caused by the ebolavirus contracted when one comes into contact with infected body fluid. Scientists say the symptoms start showing from the 1st day up to 3 weeks after contracting the virus with a fever, throat and muscle pains as well as headache following thereafter. There is then nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, along with decreased functioning of liver and kidneys. At this point, some people begin to have problems with bleeding, which is associated with hemorrhagic fever.

EVD has no cure, and patients can only be treated for blood and water loss. This means that [many] of the people who suffer from it die automatically. In tackling the Ebola menace, we believe, the ministry has given us enough information about the disease and the ways to identify it in case it happens to creep into the country. God forbid! It is for this reason that we commend it for the measures so far taken. It is upon us to be alert and ensure that the epidemic does not find a way in.

[3] Nigeria: update
Date: Thu Jul 24 2014

As at 5:30 pm Nigerian time today, 24 Jul 2014, what we have is a laboratory result indicating possible infection with a filovirus, the family to which ebolaviruses belong. This is still awaiting confirmation from another laboratory, [expected] any time from now.

However, with the case arriving from Liberia and reportedly sick before leaving for Nigeria, current evidence points to a possible imported Ebola virus disease case. The steps taken by the government are the right ones.

Let me also say that the discovery of the suspected case was fortuitous, that is, through luck and chance, certainly not because of our preparedness. It was reported that the case, already sick from Liberia, collapsed or slumped soon upon arrival on an ASKY flight in Lagos. By now we should have traced all the contacts on the plane, at the airport and wherever the case was taken to. We thank God for luck and chance.

[I am afraid there is no way to "ensure that the epidemic does not find a way in" to any country. The answer is to place the suspected case in an isolation ward while being tested, and wear full PPE (personal protective equipment) when touching the patient.

ASKY airlines (http://www.flyasky.com/asky) flies from Freetown, Sierra Leone to:
Abidjan, Abuja and Lagos, Nigeria
Accra, Ghana
Bamako, Mali
Bangui, Central African Republic
Brazzaville, Congo Rep.
Cotonou, Benin
Dakar, Senegal
Douala, Cameroun
Kinshasa, Congo DR
Libreville, Gabon
(see map at http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/africa/maps/africa.jpg)

All those airports now need to check the health of passengers arriving with Liberian passports (or identification as nationals) of the 3 affected countries, and the nationalities of patients hospitalized with severe fevers within 3 weeks of arrival from them. What a job! - Mod.JW]
