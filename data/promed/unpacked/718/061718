California authorities are investigating a valley fever [coccidioidomycosis] outbreak that sickened 28 workers at solar power plants under construction in central California. The Los Angeles Times (http://lat.ms/10TMNwA) says public health and work safety staff visited 2 sites in San Luis Obispo County 2 months ago.

Valley fever is contracted by breathing spores from a fungus found in desert soil. It can cause flu-like symptoms and death in extreme cases. Mark Simonin of an electrical workers union says one infected worker was an electrician who inhaled dust while digging at one site.

California is trying to stem a valley fever outbreak that has caused dozens of deaths among Central Valley prisoners since 2006. This week, federal officials ordered more than 3000 inmates relocated.

[The California counties of Kern, Kings, Tulare, Fresno, Madera, and San Luis Obispo are the coccidioides-endemic areas; these counties had the highest annual average incidence rates for coccidioidomycosis, and their cumulative cases represent 76 per cent of all cases reported from California for years 2001-2009 (see Figure 9 at: https://www.vfce.arizona.edu/resources/pdf/2011_coccidioidomycosis_epi.pdf).

Coccidioidomycosis is due to inhalation of spores of _Coccidioides immitis_, a soil organism, that have become airborne during conditions that disturb the soil. This outbreak of coccidioidomycosis among workers at solar power plants under construction in San Luis Obispo County reported in the news report above is another example of a cluster of cases occurring in an endemic area among those engaged in soil-disrupting activities, such as farming, mining, quarrying, and construction (http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/ohb/Documents/OccCocci.pdf). The sickened workers may have previously not been exposed to _C. immitis_ spores, as they recently moved to San Luis Obispo County for work at the solar power plants under construction from regions where coccidioidomycosis is not endemic. For a detailed discussion of coccidioidomycosis, see ProMED-mail post Coccidioidomycosis - USA (05): (CA) prison, fatal 20130502.1685779.

San Luis Obispo county is located along the Pacific ocean in the central coast of the US state of California, about midway between Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area. As of the 2010 census, its population was 269 637 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Luis_Obispo_County,_California). San Luis Obispo county is the 3rd largest producer of wine in California, surpassed only by Sonoma and Napa counties. The county is also the location of California Polytechnic State University, with almost 20 000 students.
