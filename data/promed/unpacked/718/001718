Scottish farmers have been urged to continue checking for signs of foot and
mouth disease (FMD) among their herds and flocks after new cases were
confirmed in the Borders and Dumfriesshire. The outbreak at Bridge End Farm
at Eastriggs near Annan is the first in Dumfries and Galloway for 10 days.
All 135 cattle will be slaughtered and burned on site. It follows
confirmation of a case near Duns in the Scottish Borders, which was the
first case in that region for 4 weeks.
John Kinnaird, deputy president of the National Farmers' Union of Scotland
(NFUS), said "every precaution possible" was needed to stamp the disease
out. Every vehicle, person, and animal is a potential carrier, he said. The
total number of cases in Scotland now stands at 185, with all but 10 in the
south west.
An emergency coordination group has been set up to make plans for tackling
the latest Borders FMD outbreak. The case was confirmed on Tuesday at
Cothill Farm, near Duns in Berwickshire, a month after the last previous
case in the area. The most recent case near Duns was confirmed at
Rulesmains on 25 April. A spokesman for Borders Council said it was hoped
that arable land around the infected farm would act as a natural firebreak
against any further spread of the disease. Some 800 sheep and 1500 lambs
are to be slaughtered at various locations in the Greenlaw area, all of
which are premises operated by the same farmer. Sheep on 2 neighboring
farms will also be culled, but there will not be an automatic cull in a 3
km zone.
Military personnel will not be involved, but that decision could come under
review if there are further cases. The council said [that, because of
fears expressed elsewhere over public health, the animals are to be taken
for rendering in sealed vehicles.
More than half of all farms in Dumfries and Galloway are believed to have
been affected by a mass cull undertaken in an effort to get rid of the
disease. The new cases follow the discovery of a cluster of 18 cases at
Settle in North Yorkshire. Movement restrictions have been tightened in
Yorkshire amid fears that sheep harboring the disease are infecting cattle
that have been released for pasture.

Farm disease cluster sparks alert in north England
-------------------------------------
On Wednesday, the British government decided to sent extra vets and troops
to tackle an outbreak of foot and mouth disease (FMD) in North Yorkshire.
The area around Settle in northern England has seen 17 confirmed FMD cases
since 10 May, the most recent on Tuesday at a farm in Kirby Mallam.
An extra 25 vets were being drafted in, and more troops were being sent to
Settle to oversee the culling operation. Officials now believe the disease
has been in animals in north Yorkshire for 3 weeks. The Ministry of
Agriculture has said the cluster was a "localized" outbreak, not connected
to the widespread movement of infected animals. The ministry admitted the
outbreak was only identified once it began appearing in cattle, and could
have been present in sheep for some weeks. The government has reimposed
movement restrictions on livestock in the Settle and Clitheroe areas, while
investigators attempt to trace the source of the latest cluster. A ministry
spokesman said: "We believe the movements of animals and perhaps people are
partly behind this latest outbreak."
There have been 1628 reported cases of FMD in the UK, resulting in the
slaughter of millions of animals since the first cases were confirmed on
February 20.
