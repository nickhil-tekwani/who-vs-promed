The last update published on the web registers a total number of 42
outbreaks for the year 2005. This total does not include 6 other outbreaks
registered in January 2005 and considered [to be] the last outbreaks of the
2004 summer-autumn epidemic.
26 outbreaks have been reported in Andalusia (Huelva 13, Sevilla 13), and
the other 16 have been detected in Extremadura (Badajoz 10 and Caceres 6).
The species found infected are bovine in 45 cases and caprine in one.
The northernmost detection of BT virus is in the localities of Coria, Toril
and Talayuela (39.59o N). The restriction zone established 20 km around the
infected premises in Talayuela affects the municipalities of Candelada,
Arenas de San Pedro and Sotillo de la Adrada in the province of Avila.
A map of the affected areas and restriction zones can be consulted at
<http://rasve.mapa.es/Publica/Noticias/Ficheros/Mapa%20de%20radio%2020%20km.pdf>.
The map indicating the areas of Spain where the presence of _Culicoides
imicola_ has been detected in 2005 can be seen at

[Although this report does not differ significantly from the previous
report, it does add some maps. However, Spain has still not issued an OIE
report on this situation since 29 Jul 2005, and the situation does not
appear to be improving, rather the opposite. - Mod.TG]
