Health officials in Incheon are on alert after 2 _Vibrio_ sepsis patients died there while receiving treatment. They contracted the disease after eating raw fish. In 2014, 10 cases have been reported throughout the country, most of which occurred in South Jeolla Province.

According to the Incheon Metropolitan Government, a 53 year old patient from Ganghwa-gun died 14 Aug 2014 at a hospital where he had been treated for severe abdominal pains and diarrhea. He was the 2nd _Vibrio_ sepsis patient in Incheon to die, following another fatality in Bupyeong-gu.

The bacterium _Vibrio vulnificus_ is commonly contracted through the consumption of raw or undercooked seafood. The resulting sepsis can cause abdominal pain and vomiting, among other symptoms. It is more dangerous for people suffering from liver diseases and diabetes.

"People with diabetes or liver disorders should be careful of eating seafood, and those who have open cuts should stay out of the sea as the bacteria can also be waterborne," an official said.

[The following is extracted from the "Bad Bug Book," Center for Safety and Applied Nutrition, US FDA (Food and Drug Administration), at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/UCM297627.pdf:

_Vibrio vulnificus_, a lactose-fermenting, halophilic, Gram negative, opportunistic pathogen, is found in estuarine environments and is associated with various marine species such as plankton, shellfish (oysters, clams, and crabs), and finfish. Environmental factors responsible for controlling numbers of _V. vulnificus_ in seafood and in the environment include temperature, pH [acidity], salinity, and amounts of dissolved organics. It may be normal flora in salt water, and acquiring this organism from shellfish or water exposure does not imply that the water is contaminated by sewage.

Wound infections result either from contaminating an open wound with sea water harboring the organism or by lacerating part of the body on coral, fish, etc., followed by contamination with the organism. The ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in gastroenteritis.

The "primary septicemia" form of the disease follows consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals with underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease. The organism can also enter through damaged skin. In these individuals, the microorganism enters the blood stream, resulting in septic shock, rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50 percent). Over 70 percent of infected individuals have distinctive bullous skin lesions (shown at http://safeoysters.org/medical/diagnosis.html).

There are 2 points to be emphasized: that vibrios are normal flora in warm saltwater (not indicative of any sewage contamination), and that most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. So-called normal individuals often just get gastroenteritis. The range of disease due to _V. vulnificus_ can include more northern geographical areas if the area is affected by a substantial heat wave. - Mod.LL
