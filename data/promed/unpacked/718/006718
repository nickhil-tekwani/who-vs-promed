Abstract
Minks are raised in many countries and have transmitted severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to humans. However, the biologic properties of SARS-CoV-2 in minks are largely unknown. Here, we investigated and found that SARS-CoV-2 replicates efficiently in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts and transmits efficiently in minks via respiratory droplets; pulmonary lesions caused by SARS-CoV-2 in minks are similar to those seen in humans with COVID-19. We further found that a spike-protein-based subunit vaccine largely prevented SARS-CoV-2 replication and lung damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection in minks. Our study indicates that minks are a useful animal model for evaluating the efficacy of drugs or vaccines against COVID-19 and that vaccination is a potential strategy to prevent minks from transmitting SARS-CoV-2.

[The 21 minks used in the study were, reportedly, 13-month-old male/female mixed outbred minks from local farms. (See "Supplementary materials" at https://tinyurl.com/y5stx8e4). The paper addresses, in fact, 3 separate animal trials:

1. [3 minks] "To evaluate the replication of SARS-CoV-2, 3 minks were intranasally (i.n.) inoculated with 5 million PFU of the virus strain HRB25 [SARS-CoV-2/HRB25/human/2020/CHN (GISAID access no. EPI_ISL_467430)]. On day 4 post-inoculation (p.i.), animals were euthanized, and their organs, including nasal turbinates, soft palates, tonsils, tracheas, lungs, hearts, submaxillary lymph nodes, kidneys, spleens, livers, small intestines, and brains, were collected for viral RNA detection by qPCR, virus titration in Vero E6 cells, and histological studies."

2. [6 minks] "To investigate the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in minks, 3 animals were inoculated i.n. with 5 million PFU of HRB25, and each animal was placed in a separate cage within an isolator; 24 hours later, 3 similar-aged naive minks were placed in each cage adjacent to the ones that held the virus-inoculated minks. Nasal washes and rectal and concha swabs were collected, and body weights were monitored every other day from days 2 to 18 p.i. (inoculated animals) or from days 1 to 17 post-exposure (p.e.) (exposed animals) for viral RNA detection and virus titration. Clinical signs were observed daily. Sera were collected on day 18 p.i., and antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected by using the Double Antigen Sandwich ELISA kit and a neutralization assay."

3. [12 minks] "To evaluate the protective efficacy of the spike-based subunit vaccine in minks, 6 minks were immunized intramuscularly with 2 doses of an aluminium-adjuvanted subunit vaccine. Each dose contained 25 micrograms of the spike protein in a 0.5-ml volume, administered with a 2-week interval between doses. Six similar-aged naive minks were used as controls. Five weeks after the 2nd inoculation, sera from the vaccinated animals were collected for antibody detection, and all of the minks were then challenged i.n. with 5 million PFU of HRB25. Three animals from each group were euthanized on day 4 p.c., and their organs were collected for viral RNA detection and virus titration. Nasal washes were collected every other day from the other 3 minks in each group to monitor virus shedding for 18 days. Viral RNA and viral titers of control and vaccinated minks were statistically analyzed by using the one-tailed unpaired t-test. P values of less than 0.05 were considered significant."

From the discussion chapter, the following abridged extracts are notable (for the omitted references, see full text at the source URL):

"In the present study, we found that virus-inoculated minks lost 10%-20% of their body weight at around day 8 p.i., and exposed minks lost about 5% of their body weight, but none of the virus-inoculated or -exposed minks died. The exposed animals lost less body weight than the virus-inoculated animals, largely because the initial dose received by the exposed animals was much lower than that received by the inoculated animals, although the titer of the virus in the exposed animals reached a peak level similar to that of the inoculated animals. These findings suggest that pregnant minks may be more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection than non-pregnant ones. Given that minks are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and could be easily infected by this widely spreading virus, surveillance and active control measures in minks should be implemented to prevent minks from becoming reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2."

"SARS-CoV-2 replicates in the upper and lower respiratory tracts of minks and causes lung lesions highly similar to those seen in human COVID-19 patients. Accordingly, using minks as model animals will enable us to more precisely evaluate the efficacy of antiviral drugs or vaccines for COVID-19."

"In the present study, we found that a spike-protein-based subunit vaccine largely prevented SARS-CoV-2 replication and protected minks from SARS-CoV-2-induced lung damage. Our previous studies with H7N9 influenza viruses have showed that vaccinated animals could be perfectly protected from exposure to virus-infected animals, even though the vaccine cannot provide complete protection when the animals were challenged by direct infection. Given that the vaccine provided sound protection to high dose of SARS-CoV-2 challenge, it is reasonable to speculate that the vaccinated animals would be protected from infection of natural exposure. Vaccination may, therefore, be an option for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection of minks."

The study was performed in the biosafety level 4 laboratory and the animal biosafety level 4 facilities in the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute (HVRI) of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS). HVRI is OIE's collaborating Centre for Zoonoses of Asia-Pacific. The 2 corresponding authors, Hualan Chen and Zhigao Bu, also led earlier COVID-19 studies involving several companion and farm animal species (item 2 in 20200402.7173286).

The paper does not indicate the measures undertaken to secure the origin of the ("naive") minks for the experimentation from an uninfected farm. It may be assumed that surveillance for COVID-19 has already been covering (at least) some of China's numerous mink farms. Unfortunately, no official information on such surveillance, nor of any other animal health (and zoonotic) aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic in China, have become available to OIE's members since 5 Feb 2020 (when an OIE-initiated Q&A was published; https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Our_scientific_expertise/docs/pdf/COV-19/China_update_COVID-19.pdf).

A WHO team of international researchers, including animal-health experts, is due to visit China in order to study the origin of COVID-19. It may be anticipated that minks and other fur animals will be included in the team's schedule. A smaller group visited China earlier this year [2020] to lay the groundwork for the larger team's visit.
