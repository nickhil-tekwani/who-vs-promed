Multistate Outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 Infections Linked to Chopped Romaine Lettuce
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since the last update on April 10, 2018, 18 more people from 9 states were added to this outbreak.

As of April 12, 2018, 35 people infected with the outbreak strain of _E. coli_ O157:H7 have been reported from 11 states. Illnesses started on dates ranging from [Thu 22 Mar 2018 to Sat 31 Mar 2018]. Ill people range in age from 12 to 84 years, with a median age of 29. Up to 69 percent of ill people are female. A total of 22 ill people have been hospitalized, including 3 people who developed hemolytic uremic syndrome, a type of kidney failure. No deaths have been reported.

Ohio / 2
Pennsylvania / 9
Virginia / 1
Washington / 1
--------------
Total / 35

Illnesses that occurred after [Tue 27 Mar 2018], might not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill with _E. coli_ and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2 to 3 weeks. The current outbreak is not related to a recent multistate outbreak of _E. coli_ O157:H7 infections linked to leafy greens. People in the previous outbreak were infected with a different DNA fingerprint of _E. coli_ O157:H7 bacteria.

Investigation Update
--------------------
Epidemiologic evidence collected to date indicates that chopped romaine lettuce is the likely source of this outbreak. 26 (93 percent) of 28 people interviewed reported consuming romaine lettuce in the week before their illness started. This percentage is significantly higher than results from a survey of healthy people in which 46 percent reported eating romaine lettuce in the week before they were interviewed. Most people reported eating a salad at a restaurant, and romaine lettuce was the only common ingredient identified among the salads eaten. The restaurants reported using bagged, chopped romaine lettuce to make salads. At this time, ill people are not reporting whole heads or hearts of romaine.

Traceback investigations are ongoing to determine the source of chopped romaine lettuce supplied to restaurant locations where ill people ate. At this time, no common grower, supplier, distributor, or brand has been identified. However, preliminary information indicates that the chopped romaine lettuce was from the Yuma, Arizona growing region. Information collected to date indicates that chopped romaine lettuce from the Yuma, Arizona growing region could be contaminated with _E. coli_ O157:H7 and could make people sick.

This investigation is ongoing, and CDC will provide more information as it becomes available.

[This is a further expansion of the outbreak which was originally reported from New Jersey and the vehicle is noted to be romaine lettuce.

ProMED has previously posted on outbreaks of enteric pathogens, including both O157 and non-O157 EHEC, salmonellosis and yersinosis associated with lettuce. The contamination of the produce can occur at any step in the food chain from growth in a field to harvesting to contamination in a restaurant or home kitchen. While aggressive washing of the produce can remove outside contamination, pathogens can internalize as well as highlighted in this paper:

Wright KM, Crozier L, Marshall J, Merget B, Holmes A, Holden NJ: Differences in internalization and growth of _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 within the apoplast of edible plants, spinach and lettuce, compared with the model species _Nicotiana benthamiana_. Microb Biotechnol. 2017;10: 555-569.

Abstract
--------
Internalization of food-borne bacteria into edible parts of fresh produce plants represents a serious health risk. Therefore, internalization of verocytotoxigenic _E. coli_ O157:H7 isolate Sakai was assessed in 2 species associated with outbreaks, spinach (_Spinacia oleracea_) and lettuce (_Lactuca sativa_) and compared to the model species _Nicotiana benthamiana_. Internalization occurred in the leaves and roots of spinach and lettuce throughout a 10-day time-course. The plant species, tissue type and inoculum dose all impacted the outcome. A combination of low inoculum dose (approx. 100 CFU) together with light microscopy imaging highlighted marked differences in the fate of endophytic _E. coli_ O157:H7 Sakai. In the fresh produce species, bacterial growth was restricted but viable cells persisted over 20 days, whereas there was a greater than 400-fold increase in growth in _N. benthamiana_. Colony formation occurred adjacent to epidermal cells and mesophyll cells or close to vascular bundles of _N. benthamiana_ and contained components of a biofilm matrix, including curli expression and elicitation, extracellular DNA and a limited presence of cellulose. Together the data show that internalization is a relevant issue in crop production and that crop species and tissue need to be considered as food safety risk parameters.
