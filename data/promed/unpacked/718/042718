In June 2011, 480 cases of chikungunya virus infections have been
reported in a southern district of Brazzaville, Republic of Congo
(ProMED-mail archive number 20110613.1806). Positive markers for
chikungunya virus infection were found by the regional reference
laboratory confirming the etiology of the outbreak. To complete these
data, we report an imported case in metropolitan France with a
positive diagnosis for chikungunya virus infection. The patient, who
is living in Brazzaville, arrived in France on 3 May [2011] and
immediately declared fever, severe arthralgia, myalgia and ankle
oedema.

A blood sample taken on 5 May [2011] was found positive by
chikungunya RT-PCR and the virus could be isolated on Vero cells.
Sequence analysis of E1 protein revealed that this isolate belongs to
the East-Central South Africa (ECSA) genotype of chikungunya [virus]
and more precisely to the Central Africa subgroup, clustered with
isolates from Cameroon in 2006 and from Gabon in 2007. The E1-A226V
mutation, associated to an adaptation to _Aedes albopictus_, has been
evidenced in this strain, which also exhibited 100 per cent nucleotide
identity with the Gabon isolate. Such type of isolates were known to
circulate in Central Africa and Western Africa at least since 2006
(Peyrefitte et al, Emerg Inf Dis. 2007;13(5) : 768-771 and Peyrefitte
et al. J. Med. Virol. 2008;80:430 433). The presence of _Ae.
albopictus_ in the Republic of Congo is not documented yet but its
formal identification in countries bordering the Republic of Congo
raise the question of the participation of this vector species in the
present outbreak. Thus it is critical to obtain entomologic
information in Brazzaville especially because of the genomic markers
that may potentiate chikungunya virus [transmission] in Brazzaville.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Grandadam and colleagues for this valuable
followup report on the chikungunya outbreak in the RC, along with
their genetic assessment placing the virus in the Central African
subgroup.

It will be of interest to know if _Aedes albopictus_ is present in
Brazzaville in numbers sufficient to support the outbreak, or if the
vector involved is _Ae. aegypti_ or another mosquito species. The
Institut Pasteur group and colleagues are to be congratulated for
their timely studies and willingness to share their information so
quickly.
