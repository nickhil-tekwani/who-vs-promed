https://www.retsinformation.dk/eli/lta/2020/926


The purpose of this executive order is to ensure that, in connection with suspected COVID-19 in fur animals, the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration may take samples and monitor the prevalence of COVID-19 in fur animals and introduce infection prevention measures.

a. Mandatory notification

1. Anyone who, in his custody, has fur animals [see comment] where one or more fur animals are or can be suspected of being infected with COVID-19 shall call a veterinarian. A veterinarian can be called when, for example, the fur animal presents symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting, respiratory symptoms, or elevated temperature.

2. Anyone who, in his custody, has fur animals suspected of being infected with COVID-19 as a result of contact between fur animals and people who have been recognized as COVID-19 patients should contact the Food Authority.

3. If a veterinary surgeon suspects the presence of COVID-19 in a fur animal in connection with his/her work, the veterinarian must immediately notify the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration and, following his instructions, take and submit material for examination at the national reference laboratory.

4. When detecting COVID-19 in fur animals, veterinarians and employees of diagnostic laboratories must contact the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration.

b. Screening

1. At the request of the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration, the owner or user of a fur farm must let the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration collect and submit samples of relevant material from the fur animals or the surroundings of the fur animal for examination for COVID-19.

2. The owner or user shall assist the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration with the above sampling.

3. The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration may test samples that were collected for other purposes for COVID-19.

4. Results from the studies referred to in paragraph 1 or paragraph 3 will be used to map the prevalence of COVID-19 in fur animals.

5. The above-mentioned tests may be included in research projects concerning COVID-19.

[According to the definitions section (not copied), "fur animals" in the Order mean "mink and ferrets."

The above articles have been selectively copied from the official legislative notice, which turns COVID-19 in farmed minks into a notifiable disease in Denmark, similar to the measures undertaken in the Netherlands. Other countries in which mink farming is practiced may consider acting similarly in line with One Health policy, as well as with OIE's recommendations.

The world's leading mink-farming countries are Denmark, China, the Netherlands, Poland, and the USA. - Mod.AS]

According to Food Minister Mogens Jensen, the discovery of COVID-19 in Danish mink has created a need for a greater overview of the occurrence of the virus in mink. Therefore, the government is launching a new screening strategy.

The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration has detected COVID-19 in 2 minks, out of 46 samples collected by officials of the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration, in a farm in North Jutland on Thursday [18 Jun 2020]. The tests were applied by the State Serum Institute.

This means that the authorities have now found COVID-19 in 2 Northern Jutland mink herds in one week. Since only a few of the animals tested COVID-19 positive in the latest mink farm, the National Board of Food will conduct several tests on Monday [22 Jun 2020] to have a better basis for deciding what to do with the crew.

- The government has decided that the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration is now launching a screening of 120 mink herds across the country. The screening should show us whether the 1st findings were isolated cases, or whether there was a more widespread infection in the mink herds. The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration will use the results in the further handling of COVID-19 among animals and humans, says Mogens Jensen.

The health authorities are also aware of the situation.

- We are following developments closely. The National Serum Institute and the food authorities work together under high pressure to gain more knowledge about how the chains of infection move in the area. We are ready for further action. At present, it is still unclear whether the minks have infected the people or vice versa, says Health Minister Magnus Heunicke.

Infected dog
-------------
Veterinary and Food Administration has also found COVID-19 infection in a family dog [on the 1st infected farm]. Worldwide, some pets have been found with COVID-19, but this is the 1st case in Denmark.

- Therefore, the owner of the mink farm has been told that they should treat the dog according to the same recommendations that they themselves have been given in relation to COVID-19. This means that they and the dog must avoid close contact with other animals and people outside the household and maintain good hygiene, and the dog must only be ventilated on the mat, says Mogens Jensen.

The research has found no evidence that pets play a greater role in the spread of COVID-19. Dog and pet owners, therefore, should follow the same guidelines that apply to humans generally. On the Food Authority's website, one can read more about how to behave (https://www.foedevarestyrelsen.dk/Leksikon/Sider/Coronavirus-og-k%C3%A6ledyr.aspx).

The Board of Food maintains the restrictions imposed on the farm on Thursday [18 Jun 2020]. Thus, no animals and only a few people are allowed in and out of the herd.

[The 1st Danish outbreak was reported to the OIE on 17 Jun 2020 (see 20200617.7479510). It would be interesting to note if the Danish authorities address cats on the premises of infected mink farms, as done by the Dutch authorities.

So far, the following OIE member countries have been keeping the OIE updated on any investigations or outcomes of investigations in animals:
