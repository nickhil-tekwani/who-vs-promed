[It is now 14 days since the last report of a locally transmitted case in Wuhan. In today's report, there are 10 new reports of locally transmitted infection -- 7 in Heilongjiang, 2 in Guangdong, and 1 in Sichuan. It has now been 24 days since restrictions were lifted in Guangdong and Heilongjiang and it appears as though local transmission has been established in both Heilongjiang and Guangdong over the past 13 days or so... I repeat my questions of 7 Apr 2020: is this increase related to the lifting of restrictions? Are there chains of transmission that can easily be followed? Are these cases related to importations? There were a total of 27 newly confirmed cases of which 17 were imported cases.

According to the report above, a total of 82 719 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 4632 deaths, representing an increase of 27 cases mentioned above, (plus the 325 adjusted cases from Wuhan revision announced yesterday) in the 24 hours since yesterday's (16 Apr 2020) report, and while there were no newly reported deaths, there were 1290 adjusted deaths reported as part of the Wuhan review of the epidemiologic situation in Wuhan. An additional 5 suspected cases were newly reported, all imported cases, 3 in Shanghai and 2 in Heilongjiang. 4 new cases were reported from Hong Kong, where numbers of newly confirmed cases continue to be reported daily but decreasing. And Macau has reported no newly confirmed cases.

A total of 17 newly confirmed cases were imported cases into China. Origins of importation were not available but the total number of imported cases is now 1566. There are an additional 58 suspected imported cases. Clearly the challenge for China now is the identification of infections in imported cases, tracing their contacts, and preventing the recurrence of community wide transmission.

As best as I can decipher from the machine-translated report above, there were 54 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic people in the past 24 hours, 3 in imported cases. The total number of asymptomatic individuals currently under observation (and isolation) is 1017. 191 of these are importations from abroad. I believe they mention there were 9 asymptomatic cases who developed symptoms in the past 24 hours, 6 of whom were imported cases. It would be helpful to know what proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals went on to be symptomatic to start developing projections of actual infection rates, and adjust reported case fatality ratios accordingly.

As reported, on 24 Mar 2020 China ended the lockdown in Hubei and elsewhere, and ended it in Wuhan on 7 Apr 2020. There is much caution and skepticism in the media over the reality of the zero case reports. The world is watching carefully to see if this is safe timing. There does appear to be chains of transmission ongoing in Guangdong and Heilongjiang that are of concern, but clearly the most concern is the imported cases returning to China.

[4] Iran: 79 474 total cases, 4958 deaths

Source: News 18, Reuters report [edited]
https://www.news18.com/news/world/89-new-coronavirus-deaths-takes-irans-total-to-4958-2581823.html


Iran said on Friday [17 Apr 2020] 89 more people have died from the novel coronavirus [COVID-19], as the country's official fatalities remained in double figures for a 4th day. Health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour told a news conference that the latest deaths brought the overall toll to 4958. It was the 6th day that the official fatality rate has dropped in the Middle East's worst-hit country.

Jahanpour added that 1499 new infections had been confirmed in the past 24 hours, taking the total to 79 494 from 319 879 tests. Of those confirmed to be infected with the coronavirus and admitted to hospital, 54 064 had been discharged after recovering. Another 3563 were in critical condition.

Ever since the country reported its 1st deaths 2 months ago, there has been speculation abroad that the tolls are higher than officially announced. A parliamentary report on Tuesday [14 Apr 2020] said the officially announced figures were based only on those hospitalised with "severe symptoms". It said the death toll was estimated to be as much as 80 percent more and infections "8 to 10 times" higher. The health ministry has confirmed the numbers may be higher due to limited testing.

The government of President Hassan Rouhani has struggled to contain the outbreak and keep Iran's fragile and sanctions-hit economy running. It shut schools and universities, postponed major events, and imposed a range of other restrictions, but it has stopped short of ordering lockdowns.

Iran is to allow small businesses in Tehran to reopen on Saturday [18 Apr 2020], following similar measures for those outside the capital last week. The move has faced criticism from health experts and even some authorities, but top officials argue that sanctions-hit Iran cannot afford to shut down its economy.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA, as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 710 021, including 37 158 deaths, an increase from 677 570 cases, and 34 617 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York state, with 233 951 (33.0%) cumulative case reports and 7753 (23.9%) newly confirmed cases over the past 24 hours, is clearly the epicenter of the outbreak in the USA, although case reporting elsewhere is increasing. New York City, according to the New York City Department of Health (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page) website reported 122 148 cases and 7890 confirmed deaths and 4309 probable deaths as of 2:30 pm on 17 Apr 2020 (note: earlier updates were at 5 pm on the day of the update and more recently at 1 PM EDT). Daily reported case counts are high in New Jersey (3150 newly confirmed cases 9.7%), Massachusetts (2221 newly confirmed cases 6.8%), Pennsylvania (2186 newly confirmed cases 6.7%), Illinois (1842 newly confirmed cases 5.7%), California (1541 newly confirmed cases 4.8%), and Florida (1413 newly confirmed cases 4.4%). In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number 1, followed by New Jersey, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, California, Illinois, Florida, and Louisiana.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) has 2 epidemic curves. One focuses on date of confirmation of disease, the other on date of onset of illness.

[Spain is 2nd globally in terms of the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19. Unfortunately, the apparent major decline in daily reported cases is not holding up with 5252 newly confirmed cases reported today (17 Apr 2020) and 5183 cases reported yesterday (16 Apr 2020), returning to the plateau levels of 4000-5000 cases newly confirmed each day -- perhaps the increased decline was a function of the Easter holidays.

As of today [17 Apr 2020], totals of 188 068 cases and 19 478 deaths have been reported, up from 182 816 cases and 19 130 deaths in the preceding 24 hours (16 Apr 2020). The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population is now 149.61, slowly decreasing over the past 7 days from a high of 214.43 on 7 Apr 2020 to 154.43 today [14 Apr 2020]. Spain has the highest case count in Europe and 2nd globally behind the USA in terms of absolute numbers of cases. Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease, and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times. There is also a clear growth curve showing the trajectory of the epidemic at https://covid19.isciii.es/; it is updated daily.

Of the 188 068 cases, approximately 75 593 (40.2%) have been hospitalized and 7363 (3.9%) admitted to the ICU (there is a note mentioning that some of the communities are providing daily prevalence data, hence my use of "approximately" for hospitalization and ICU data.
