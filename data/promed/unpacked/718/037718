MRSA surveillance in Dutch hospitals from Jan to Jul 2001: an update &
overview
----------------------------------------
A surveillance programme for methicillin resistant _Staphylococcus
aureus_ (MRSA) in Dutch hospitals was set up by the Rijksinstituut
voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu (RIVM, the National Institute of Public
Health and the Environment) in 1989, at the request of the Dutch
Health Inspectorate (1-3). Medical microbiologists were asked to send
all their MRSA isolates to RIVM for extended typing, such as phage
typing and antibiotic resistance typing, which was carried out free of
charge. About 230 patient MRSA isolates were sent to RIVM between
January and July 2001.
The results of the surveillance programme are summarised below:
MRSA continues to account for a small proportion, about 0.9%, of all
_S. aureus_ isolates; this is the result of strict isolation of
patients and staff carrying MRSA, eradication procedures for MRSA, and
a restrictive antibiotic policy in the Netherlands.
The proportion of index patients who acquired MRSA abroad further
decreased, from 20% to less than 15%. This implies that most MRSA
infections in the Netherlands are caused by indigenous strains. The
larger hospital outbreaks were caused mainly by 'epidemic' strains
(belonging to the phage groups III and Z) that spread easily.
The importance of molecular techniques (especially pulsed field gel
electrophoresis) for epidemiological subtyping of MRSA is discussed.

[This information is encouraging for those concerned about control of
emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of human pathogens.
Comparison of these results to those experienced by others in
countries utilizing different -- or less-restrictive -- antibiotic
usage policies would be of interest. - Mod.ES
