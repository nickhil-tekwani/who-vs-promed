A 16-year-old Holsteiner gelding in Switzerland affected by neurological problems was diagnosed with tick-borne encephalitis. He made a good recovery, researchers report.

The case report, published in the journal Viruses [see citation below], is the first to describe the diagnostic criteria in a horse as recommended in humans with suspected tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) infection.

Tick-borne encephalitis is capable of causing neurological signs in humans and animals. Studies on its occurrence in horses include reports of non-specific and neurological signs. However, postmortem confirmation of infection in a horse with obvious neurological signs has been performed in only one early published case study.

Nathalie Fouche and her fellow researchers noted that the seroprevalence of the virus in the equine population in Switzerland has not been investigated to date. In other European countries, its seroprevalence in equines -- indicating previous exposure to the virus -- ranged from 2.9 to 37.5%.

The horse in the case study was referred for evaluation after showing a lack of coordination and lethargy. He also showed muscle tremors and was mildly sweating.

The gelding was treated with metamizole, which is a painkiller and spasm reliever, and the anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone before his referral to the equine hospital.

At home, the horse had been kept in a stable with daily access to pasture with other horses in a rural area. The gelding never travelled abroad nor within Switzerland.

According to the owner, the horse was regularly affected by tick bites, except during winter.

At the hospital, the horse was found to have an increased heart rate. During the 1st clinical examination, the animal was bright and responsive with normal mental activity. There were no cranial nerve deficits apart from a questionable mild facial nerve paralysis with drooping of the right upper and lower lip.

An asymmetry of the temporal muscle with a slightly decreased tone on the right side was also noted. The horse showed fine muscle twitches and tremors on the nostrils, lips, and eyelids. The gelding was eating, drinking, defecating, and urinating normally.

In the 1st 24 hours of hospitalisation, the horse displayed periods of severe lethargy, during which incoordination with a drift towards the right side was observed when the horse walked. It was more pronounced in the hind than the forelimbs. A complete blood count and serum biochemistry profile were undertaken, and a cerebrospinal fluid sample was obtained for analysis. Laboratory findings in the horse were indicative of viral infection and general inflammation.

Molecular-based testing of samples from the horse confirmed infection with TBEV, with evidence of acute and recent infection. Treatment consisted of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug flunixin-meglumine, the steroid prednisolone, and vitamin E.

The horse remained hospitalized for 6 days and continued to show muscle twitches and periods of lethargy, during which a lack of coordination was still observed. The clinical signs gradually became less pronounced and less frequent and were absent by the end of the hospital stay on day 6. The horse was discharged but continued on the medications for another 2 weeks.

Three weeks after discharge, the horse was presented for a re-examination. Vital parameters were within normal limits and the horse did not show any signs of lethargy, according to the owner. The neurological examination was normal except for a slight persisting facial asymmetry with drooping of the nostril on the right side.

The owner reported that the gelding showed no signs of disease 12 months after discharge.

"In conclusion, this is the 1st report to describe ante-mortem diagnosis of TBEV in a horse based on the diagnostic criteria recommended in human medicine.

"This diagnostic protocol may be implemented to investigate TBEV infection in horses living in endemic areas and showing compatible neurological signs.

"We recommend implementing this procedure in the diagnostic work-up of neurological cases with an uncertain etiology (cause) in combination with seasonal tick activity after ruling out a potential infection with West Nile virus, even in countries that are yet considered free of West Nile virus infections."

Discussing their findings, the authors noted that recent serological and PCR-based surveys in horses suggest that only a few horses exposed to, and infected with, the virus develop neurological signs -- which is similar to humans.

Nevertheless, increasing awareness and testing for West Nile virus infection (and associated testing for TBEV infection) in Europe has also raised suspicion for TBEV-related neurological disease.

"However, to date, reports about ante-mortem diagnostic investigations of suspected cases are limited. Increasing awareness of the disease should encourage equine veterinarians to investigate suspected clinical cases according to the human diagnostic guidelines."

Cases of the virus are defined by the presence of clinical signs of meningitis, meningoencephalitis, or meningoencephalomyelitis, with an increased white blood cell count in the cerebrospinal fluid, the presence of specific antibodies against the virus, including in the cerebrospinal fluid, or TBEV Immunoglobulin G seroconversion.

Treatment in humans and animals focuses on easing the signs of disease, as there is no antiviral treatment available. The horse in the case study responded well to a combination of anti-inflammatory drugs and anti-oxidative therapy, the researchers said.

Disease prevention is currently limited to reducing the contact to potentially infected ticks in endemic areas.

The case report team comprised Fouch√©, Solange Oesch, and Vinzenz Gerber, with the Swiss Institute of Equine Medicine at the University of Bern; and Ute Ziegler, with the Institute of Novel and Emerging Infectious Diseases, which is part of the Friedrich Loeffler Institute.

Abstract
--------
"Tick-borne encephalitis is an important viral tick-borne zoonosis in Europe and Asia. The disease is induced by tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). This report describes a 16-year-old Warmblood gelding presenting with sudden onset of lethargy, ataxia, and muscle fasciculations on the nostrils, the lips, and the eyelids as the most important clinical findings. The horse further had a mild facial nerve paralysis with drooping of the right upper and lower lip. The diagnosis was based on paired serum samples using TBEV-ELISAs revealing high serum IgM in the 1st sample with normal IgM in the 2nd sample and an increase in serum IgG and neutralizing antibodies, indicating acute and recent infection. TBEV was confirmed by a virus-neutralization test, revealing a 5-fold increase in antibodies 32 days after the onset of clinical signs. Although the specific PCR on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was negative, TBEV-specific IgG and IgM were identified in the CSF of the horse. Treatment consisted of anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative treatment and the horse recovered with a mild drooping of the right nostril as the only remaining clinical sign. TBEV infection is a potential differential diagnosis of neurological disease in horses living in endemic areas and this is the first report to describe the diagnostic criteria in a horse as recommended in humans with suspected TBEV infection."
