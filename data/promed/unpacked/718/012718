Medical officials have confirmed an outbreak of Crimean-Congo fever in Masindi District in Western Uganda. The disease has been confirmed in Kikingura village in Bwijanga Sub County.

"There is a health worker who died at the end of December 2018, and the blood sample tested positive for the haemorrhagic fever," said Mr Emmanuel Ainebyoona, the senior public relations officer at the Ministry of Health.

He said the deceased was given a supervised burial by medical officers to ensure that mourners are not exposed to any possible infection.

Asked about what the government is doing to handle the outbreak, Mr Ainebyoona said medical officers are on the ground to sensitize the public and following up on any suspected cases that may be reported. "The public should remain calm and report to medical officers any suspected cases," he added. He advised that people should not confuse Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever with Ebola.

Residents in Kingura in Bwijanga Sub County Masindi are living in fear after their fellow resident SM died of what they said was acute fever. He was buried on 1 Jan 2019 by officials from the World Health Organization and medical officials from the Ministry of Health.

The Masindi District health officer, Dr John Turyagaruka, urged residents to stay calm, saying that the tests taken from SM indicated that it was not Ebola but Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever.

AB, a resident, said that they need healthy guidelines to follow during this crisis to avoid contracting the disease. "They should either write and display charts with the information about the disease or move house-to-house, teaching us how to handle the symptoms," he said.

The Bwijanga Sub County chairperson Olivia Mugisa wants the residents to be informed on how to protect themselves from the disease. "We need health experts on the disease to screen our locals so that we can understand who is sick for emergency attention," she said.

According to WHO, onset of symptoms is sudden, with fever, myalgia, (muscle ache), dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, backache, headache, sore eyes and photophobia (sensitivity to light). There may be nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and sore throat early on, followed by sharp mood swings and confusion. After 2-4 days, the agitation may be replaced by sleepiness, depression and lassitude, and the abdominal pain may localize to the upper right quadrant, with detectable hepatomegaly (liver enlargement).

Other clinical signs include tachycardia (fast heart rate), lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes), and a petechial rash (a rash caused by bleeding into the skin) on internal mucosal surfaces, such as in the mouth and throat, and on the skin.

The mortality rate from CCHF is approximately 30%, with death occurring in the 2nd week of illness. In patients who recover, improvement generally begins on the 9th or 10th day after the onset of illness.

Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever is a viral haemorrhagic fever transmitted by ticks. It can be responsible for severe outbreaks in humans, but it is not pathogenic for ruminants, their amplifying hosts.

According to the WHO, CCHF virus spreads to humans either by tick-bites or through contact with viraemic animal tissues during and immediately post-slaughter.

CCHF outbreaks constitute a threat to public health services because of their epidemic potential, high case fatality ratio (10-40 percent), potential for nosocomial outbreaks, and difficulties in treatment and prevention.

The disease was 1st described in the Crimea in 1944 and given the name Crimean haemorrhagic fever. In 1969, it was recognized that the pathogen causing Crimean haemorrhagic fever was the same as that responsible for an illness identified in 1956 in the Congo, and linkage of the 2 place names resulted in the current name for the disease and the virus.

In December 2017, the Ministry of Health in Uganda confirmed an outbreak of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever and Rift Valley fever in Nakaseke and Luwero.

The Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) confirmed a positive case of CCHF in Nakaseke district. As of 18 Jan 2018, 2 confirmed and 7 suspected cases had been investigated in Nakaseke district.

Three of the 7 suspected cases were close relatives of the patient. Samples from the 7 suspected cases tested negative for CCHF.

[It seems that the early preventive measures when the suspected fatal case was reported and the supervised burial have been effective in reducing disease transmission.

Seven contacts of the suspected case have tested negative for CCHF. The report does not clarify whether this was the total number of contacts investigated.

Uganda lies between countries that have frequent outbreaks of RVF and in which CCHF is endemic: Kenya, Somalia, Tanzania, and Sudan. A recent Food and Agriculture Organization risk analysis identified Uganda as at very high risk of amplification in some districts of the cattle corridor, which covers 52 districts cutting across the central part of the country from the southwest in Ankole-Kigezi to the northeastern region in Karamoja. The RVF virus has been isolated frequently in domestic animals in all affected areas. In addition, the practice of eating "Sanga meat" (meat harvested from sick animals) in some districts heightens the risk of zoonotic transmission of both VHFs. At present, there is inadequate community engagement and social mobilization around the risks posed by these practices. Most of the 52 districts in the cattle corridor lack such engagement http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/273497/OEW30-2127072018.pdf.

Challenges around inadequate surveillance, poor case identification, point source tracing of contacts with possible contaminated animals, and active case search further hamper prevention and response efforts, increasing the risk of further transmission and geographical spread of both diseases. - Mod.UBA
