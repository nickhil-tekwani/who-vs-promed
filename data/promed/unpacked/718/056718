Root rots identified in recently lifted sugar beet, primarily on sandy East Anglian soils, have caused 'significant delivery issues', according to the British Beet Research Organisation (BBRO). BBRO has received an increase in samples affected by root rots, mostly caused by fusarium and rhizoctonia.

Unusually high temperatures during late summer [2016] are suspected to have fuelled disease development, according to BBRO's Mark Stevens. "The disease would have been in the soil and because plants were under stress we suspect this has allowed the pathogens to enter the root, but we need to do more investigation to understand exactly how this has happened."

"Often when we get root rot, the whole root disintegrates, but in most cases this [2016/17] season, the integrity of the roots has been maintained leading growers to believe the root is healthy." He warns British Sugar have the right to reject loads containing infected roots.

[Sugar beet (_Beta vulgaris_ var. _vulgaris_) is a valuable crop of temperate areas and shares a large number of pathogens with other species and varieties of _Beta_. The genus also includes several important root (for example table beets, beetroot) and leaf vegetables (various chards), as well as crops used for animal feed.

The root rots referred to above are caused by _Fusarium oxysporum_ (previously f.sp. _betae_) and _Thanatephorus cucumeris_ (previously _Rhizoctonia solani_), respectively. They can cause serious crop losses in beets.

Both pathogens are soilborne and can survive in soil for several years. They can also be spread with contaminated plant and other materials and by mechanical means (including human activities). Both can also cause wilts, yellowing, and rots of crowns and seedlings. Disease management is difficult due to the inaccessibility of underground plant parts to fungicides, as well as their wide host ranges and, therefore, numerous potential reservoir hosts. Root rot control usually requires an integrated approach and may include exclusion, phytosanitation, cultural practices and crop varieties with reduced sensitivity, if available.

Different strains of _F. oxysporum_ cause wilting diseases with serious losses in many crops, such as banana (Panama disease), guava, vanilla, date palm, and a range of cucurbits and vegetables.

_T. cucumeris_ is associated with "rhizoctonia" diseases such as damping-off, root rot, basal stem rot (foot rot), and fruit rot, in a large number of crops. Its wide host range includes cereals, pasture grasses, oilseed rape and pulses, making it difficult to control by crop rotation.
