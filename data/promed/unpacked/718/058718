WHO Statement on the Meeting of the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee Regarding the 2014 Ebola Outbreak in West Africa
-----------------------------------------
[excerpts]

After discussion and deliberation on the information provided, the Committee advised that:
- the Ebola [virus disease] outbreak in West Africa constitutes an 'extraordinary event' and a public health risk to other States;
- the possible consequences of further international spread are particularly serious in view of the virulence of the virus, the intensive community and health facility transmission patterns, and the weak health systems in the currently affected and most at-risk countries.
- a coordinated international response is deemed essential to stop and reverse the international spread of Ebola [virus disease, EVD].

***It was the unanimous view of the Committee that the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) have been met.***[Emphasis added]

This is currently the largest EVD outbreak ever recorded. In response to the outbreak, a number of unaffected countries have made a range of travel related advice or recommendations. In light of States Parties' presentations and subsequent Committee discussions, several challenges were noted for the affected countries:

- their health systems are fragile with significant deficits in human, financial and material resources, resulting in compromised ability to mount an adequate EVD outbreak control response; inexperience in dealing with EVD outbreaks; misperceptions of the disease, including how the disease is transmitted, are common and continue to be a major challenge in some communities;
- high mobility of populations and several instances of cross-border movement of travellers with infection;
- several generations of transmission have occurred in the 3 capital cities of Conakry (Guinea); Monrovia (Liberia); and Freetown (Sierra Leone); and
- a high number of infections have been identified among health-care workers, highlighting inadequate infection control practices in many facilities.

The Committee provided the following advice to the Director-General for her consideration to address the EVD outbreak in accordance with IHR (2005).


States with EVD transmission
------------------------------
- The Head of State should declare a national emergency; ...
- Health Ministers and other health leaders should assume a prominent leadership role...
- States should activate their national disaster/emergency management mechanisms...
- States should ensure that there is a large-scale and sustained effort to fully engage the community - through local, religious and traditional leaders and healers...
- It is essential that a strong supply pipeline be established to ensure that sufficient medical commodities, especially personal protective equipment (PPE), are available...
- In areas of intense transmission ... extraordinary supplemental measures such as quarantine should be used as considered necessary.
- States should ensure health care workers receive: adequate (pay, PPE)...
- States should ensure that: treatment centres and reliable diagnostic laboratories are situated as closely as possible to areas of transmission; ...
- States should conduct exit screening of all persons at international airports, seaports and major land crossings...
- There should be no international travel of Ebola contacts or cases, unless the travel is part of an appropriate medical evacuation.

To minimize the risk of international spread of EVD:
- Confirmed cases should immediately be isolated and treated...
- Contacts ... should be monitored daily, with restricted national travel...
- Probable and suspect cases should immediately be isolated and their travel should be restricted...
- States should ensure funerals and burials are conducted by well-trained personnel... cross-border movement of the human remains of deceased suspect, probable or confirmed EVD cases should be prohibited unless authorized...
- States should ensure that appropriate medical care is available for the crews and staff of airlines operating in the country...
- States with EVD transmission should consider postponing mass gatherings until EVD transmission is interrupted.


States with a potential or confirmed EVD Case, and unaffected States with land borders with affected States
---------------------
- Unaffected States with land borders adjoining States with EVD transmission should urgently establish surveillance...
- Any State newly detecting a suspect or confirmed EVD case or contact, or clusters of unexplained deaths due to febrile illness, should treat this as a health emergency...
- If EVD transmission is confirmed to be occurring in the State, the full recommendations for States with EVD Transmission should be implemented...
- There should be ***no general ban*** [emphasis added] on international travel or trade...
- States should provide travelers to EVD-affected and at-risk areas with relevant information on risks, measures to minimize those risks, and advice for managing a potential exposure.
- States should be prepared to detect, investigate, and manage EVD cases...
- The general public should be provided with accurate and relevant information on the EVD outbreak and measures to reduce the risk of exposure.
- States should be prepared to facilitate the evacuation and repatriation of nationals (e.g. health workers) who have been exposed to EVD.

The Committee emphasized the importance of continued support by WHO and other national and international partners towards the effective implementation and monitoring of these recommendations.

The Director-General endorsed the Committee's advice and issued them as Temporary Recommendations under IHR (2005) to reduce the international spread of EVD, effective 8 Aug 2014. The Director-General thanked the Committee Members and Advisors for their advice and requested their reassessment of this situation within 3 months.


[Note that in spite of WHO's statement that there should be no general ban on international travel or trade, several states and airlines are implementing unilateral bans on both, which will severely affect the economies of the EVD-infected West African countries and compound their misery. - Mod.JW]
