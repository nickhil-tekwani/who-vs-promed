Wounded troops returning from Iraq have been linked by government
scientists to outbreaks of an infection in National Health Service (NHS)
hospitals. Injured soldiers flown back to be treated on the NHS have been
infected with a strain of _Acinetobacter baumannii_, a bacterium resistant
to many antibiotics.
At a hospital in Birmingham in 2003, the bacteria went on to infect 93
people, 91 of whom were civilians. 35 died, although the hospital has not
been able to establish whether the superbug was a contributory factor. The
revelation comes amid growing concerns about the treatment of wounded
troops on NHS wards alongside civilian patients.
_Acinetobacter baumannii_ commonly inhabits soil and water and is
associated with warmer climates such as the Middle East. It is resistant to
most common antibiotics and, if left untreated, can lead to pneumonia,
fever, and septicemia. The bacterium has become a concern in the United
States army, where it has been identified in more than 240 military
personnel since 2003, killing 5.
The 1st case in a British soldier returning from Iraq has been disclosed by
scientists from the government's Health Protection Agency. In a survey of
30 NHS trusts that had received troops, they discovered a soldier at Selly
Oak, which houses the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine, had been infected
with a strain of the bacterium known as "T". Another British soldier
infected with the bug was admitted to the hospital in November 2004.
Dr Mark Enright, a reader in epidemiology at London's Imperial College,
said the bug can spread rapidly in intensive care wards. It can also
survive on dry surfaces for up to 20 days. "If you've got someone who has
been evacuated from Iraq with multiple burns and acinetobacter, it would
spread to patients in the same unit from the hands of nursing staff and
doctors," he said.
The Ministry of Defence said it was negotiating with Selly Oak to create a
military-only ward and added that it had introduced "stringent isolation
and infection control measures" that had helped limit infections among
military personnel to 2 soldiers, both of whom survived.

[It is not clear from this posting whether any of the multiresistant
acinetobacter infections occurred recently. Acinetobacter infections of
wartime injuries are not an entirely new observation of the current Middle
East conflict. Myron Tong reported that _Mimeae-Herellea_ (organisms of
which some were renamed acinetobacter) were the commonest Gram negative
bacilli isolated from wounds on day one of hospitalization in the Viet Nam
conflict (1). In addition, Aarabi found that acinetobacter was the 2nd
commonest cause of infection of missile- related head wounds in a Iranian
report from data collected during the Iran-Iraq conflict (2).
