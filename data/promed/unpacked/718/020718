Forewarning of Outbreak of Tick-borne Diseases
-----------------------------------------------
KHABAROVSK: This year's first death from tick-borne encephalitis has been
recorded in Komsomolsk-na-Amure. About 20 other people in that city have
also experienced tick bites and have been admitted to hospital on suspicion
of encephalitis, typhus, and other infections transmitted by ticks.
More than 1000 people with tick bites have already applied for medical aid
this spring, which is several times the number who sought assistance in the
spring of last year. An increase in the population of these dangerous
arthropods has been observed in the forests of Khabarovsk Territory.
