[1] Increasing global counts, new hotspots

The pandemic is ebbing in some of the countries that were hit hard early on, but the number of new cases is growing faster than ever worldwide, with more than 100 000 reported each day. Twice as many countries have reported a rise in new cases over the past 2 weeks as have reported declines, according to a New York Times database. On [30 May 2020], more new cases were reported in a single day worldwide than ever before: 134 064. The increase has been driven by emerging hot spots in Latin America, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.

Over all, there have been more than 6.3 million reported cases worldwide and more than 380 000 known deaths. More than a quarter of all known deaths have been in the United States. But the geography of the pandemic is changing quickly. The increases in some countries can be attributed to improved testing programs. But in many places, it appears that the virus has only now arrived with a wide scope and fatal force. Here is a look at some of the countries where the number of new cases has been doubling every 2 to 3 weeks.

- The death toll in Brazil, Latin America's largest country, passed 30 000 on Tuesday [2 Jun 2020], when officials reported 1262 deaths, which was the nation's highest one-day total. President Jair Bolsonaro, who has repeatedly minimized the threat, said, "We are sorry for all the dead, but that's everyone's destiny." Brazil now has more than half a million known cases, 2nd only to the United States.

But it has no health minister: 2 were forced out in less than a month after they balked at expanding the use of hydroxychloroquine, a malaria drug promoted by President Trump and subsequently Mr Bolsonaro that has not been proved effective against the virus. And despite the growing number of cases and hospitals that are close to capacity, businesses have started reopening in major cities, including Rio de Janeiro, Manaus, and Vitoria.

- Peru has more than 170 000 confirmed cases, despite taking the virus seriously early on. The president, Martin Vizcarra, ordered one of the 1st national lockdowns in South America. Though the official virus death toll stands at around 5000, Peru had 14 000 more deaths than usual in May [2020], suggesting that a growing number of people are dying at home as hospitals struggle to handle a flood of cases.

The pandemic provoked an exodus from Lima, the capital, as people unable to work fled by bus, and even by foot, to family farms. It is widely expected that the number of new cases and of deaths will continue to rise in the coming weeks as winter nears and the economy slowly reopens.

- For months, Egypt, the Arab world's most populous country, seemed to avoid the worst of the pandemic. In early March [2020], Egypt confirmed 45 cases on a Nile tour boat in the area, among both crew and passengers. But recently the number of cases there has been rising significantly, reaching 27 536 on Tuesday [2 Jun 2020].

The recent death of a young doctor, who was denied treatment for COVID-19 at an overwhelmed hospital, ignited a revolt by members of the medical staff. They said the government had failed to provide adequate protective equipment and training to front-line workers.

- With more than 35 000 confirmed infections, the most in Africa, South Africa still has a growing number of new cases, despite enacting a strict lockdown in March [2020] that included a ban on the sale of tobacco and alcohol. The prohibition was lifted this month even though the total number of cases continued to rise.

- Bangladesh now has 55 000 known cases, and its troubles were compounded last month [May 2020] by Cyclone Amphan, a deadly storm that tore through communities under lockdown. This week, the country reported its 1st death from COVID-19 in a refugee camp: A 71-year-old Rohingya man died [31 May 2020] while receiving treatment in an isolation center. His death raised fears about the hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees who, after fleeing Myanmar, live in camps with tightly packed tents and shacks.

[These are just a few of the countries where cases are picking up. Note that Brazil, Peru, and South Africa are in the southern hemisphere, where temperatures are cooling down. Additional countries experiencing major increases in numbers of cases in recent weeks include Chile and Argentina. The decrease in temperate climate countries in the northern hemisphere, coincident with the increase in temperate climate areas in the southern hemisphere (except for Australia and New Zealand, both Island nations that facilitate reduction and monitoring of importations), makes me wonder if, while not classically "seasonal", the SARS-CoV-2 doesn't have reduced transmission in warmer, more humid months than in cooler and drier months and perhaps more time spent indoors in closed spaces in the cooler months and more time outdoors in the warmer months, facilitating social distancing and reduced transmission.

I am also worried that the recent major demonstrations coupled with relaxation in shutdown regulations in multiple locations in the northern hemisphere may well lead to increased transmission in the coming weeks.

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 4 Jun 2020.

Highlights
----------
- WHO is supporting the response to a new Ebola outbreak in northwest Democratic Republic of the Congo. The new outbreak comes as the country continues to respond to the complex Ebola outbreak in the eastern part of the country, the COVID-19 pandemic, the world's largest measles outbreak, and a complex and long-standing humanitarian crisis.

- The WHO Representative in Mauritius met the President of Mauritius to discuss COVID-19. They also spoke about the overall health system in Mauritius, and what needs to be strengthened.

- The WHO Regional Director for the Americas Dr Carissa F Etienne said the Americas, "a region of massive inequalities," are facing simultaneous health, economic and social emergencies from the pandemic. Maintaining social distancing measures, improving surveillance, and strengthening health systems are key to controlling the COVID-19 pandemic in the region.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
------------------------------------------
The Americas region reported 56.8% of the global newly reported cases and 67.0% of newly reported fatalities for this 24-hour period. Brazil reported 39.4% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, the USA 33.9%, Chile 6.7%, Peru 6.6%, and Mexico 5.3%.

The European region reported 15.3 % of the global newly reported cases and 18.8% of newly reported fatalities for this 24-hour period. Russia reported 44.7% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, followed by Sweden 11.2%, the UK 9.5%, and Belarus and Turkey 4.4% each.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 13.6% of the global newly reported cases and 5.7% of global newly reported fatalities. Pakistan reported 27.4% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Iran 17.9%, Saudi Arabia 12.4%, Qatar 10.8%, Egypt 6.2%, Oman 4.2%, and Kuwait 4.1%.

The African region reported 3.2% of the global newly reported cases and 1.4% of newly reported fatalities.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 4 Jun 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. Europe has significantly decreased. The Americas region continues to increase, as does South East Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean who are both approaching parity with the European region in terms of daily newly confirmed cases. The Americas greatly outnumbers all other regions for daily reporting. - Mod.MPP]
