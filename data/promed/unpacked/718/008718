Indonesia: plans to re-test worker for avian influenza virus infection
-----------------------------------------------
Indonesia is trying to find a poultry worker in the east of the country to
test him for avian influenza virus infection for the 2nd time, after the
1st test was inconclusive, a health ministry official said on Wednesday [18
May 2005]. The authorities are testing specimens from workers at poultry
farms as part of a monitoring program put in place after the potentially
deadly disease emerged in Indonesia in late 2003. "Out of 63 specimens, one
was unclear, and we are trying to find that person to do another test,"
Umar Fahmi, the health ministry's director general of communicable disease
eradication, told reporters.
Fahmi said the poultry worker who required re-testing was in South Sulawesi
province in eastern Indonesia, where outbreaks have been reported in
poultry since the start of the year [2005]. So far, there have been no
reports of people in Indonesia being infected by avian influenza virus,
which has killed 36 Vietnamese, 12 Thais and 4 Cambodians since the disease
swept across much of the Asia region starting in late 2003.
The World Health Organization fears the virus could mutate into a form
which can pass easily among humans and trigger a global pandemic that could
kill millions. The Indonesian health ministry has increased surveillance in
affected parts of Java and eastern Indonesia to try and identify possible
cases of human infection. On Tue 17 May 2005, health officials in Viet Nam
reported a 2nd human case after a month with no reports of human cases.
