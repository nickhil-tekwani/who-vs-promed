Ebola virus disease, West Africa -- update
------------------------------------------
Guinea
------
As of 18:00 on 5 May 2014, the Ministry of Health (MOH) of Guinea has reported a cumulative total of 235 clinical cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD), including 157 deaths. There has been no change in the number of cases confirmed by ebolavirus PCR (127 cases) since the last update of 2 May 2014, but there have been 2 additional deaths: one among the confirmed cases and the other among the probable cases. This brings the number of deaths to 83.

There have been no new probable or suspected cases. In addition, 55 cases (34 deaths) are classified as suspected cases. As of 7 May [2014], one patient remains in isolation in Conakry and one in Guekedou. The date of isolation of the most recent confirmed cases is 26 Apr [2014] in Conakry and 1 May [2014] in Guekedou.

The geographical distribution of clinical cases of EVD since the beginning of the outbreak is as follows: Conakry (53 cases, including 24 deaths), Guekedou (149/107), Macenta (22/16), Kissidougou (6/5), Dabola (4/4), and Djingaraye (1/1). There have been no new cases of EVD in Kissidougou since 1 Apr [2014], Macenta since 9 Apr [2014], or Conakry since 22 Apr [2014]. In Djingaraye and Dabola, no new cases have been reported since the end of March 2014.

The cumulative total of laboratory confirmed cases and deaths since the beginning of the outbreak is: Conakry (40 cases, including 20 deaths); Guekedou (72/51); Macenta (13/10); Kissidougou (1/1); and Dabola (1/1). The analysis of the epidemiological data during the last 3 weeks shows that the number of new cases is decreasing in Guekedou.

The numbers of cases and contacts remain subject to change due to consolidation of case, contact and laboratory data, enhanced surveillance activities, and contact tracing activities. The recent introduction of ebolavirus serology to test PCR negative clinical cases is also likely to change the final number of laboratory confirmed cases.

EVD prevention and control activities continue in Guekedou. These include: a suite of innovative community sensitization and social mobilization activities with community leaders, mining companies, banks, schools and universities, and local nongovernmental organizations; the dissemination of awareness messages through rural community radio and posters; the screening of films on EVD; and providing education about EVD door-to-door in affected villages or neighborhoods.

As the incubation period for EVD can be up to 3 weeks, it is likely that the Guinean health authorities will report new cases in the coming weeks and additional suspected cases may also be identified in neighbouring countries.

Liberia
-------
There has been no change in the epidemiological situation in Liberia. The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW) of Liberia has reported that there are no current alerts of viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF)-like illness in Liberia. Active surveillance activities continue.

As of 5 May [2014], 152 contacts have completed 21 days of follow-up and been discharged from medical surveillance.

Sierra Leone
------------
As of 7 May 2014, no cases of EVD have been confirmed in Sierra Leone. From 16 Mar to 7 May 2014, the Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MOHS) of Sierra Leone has tested 106 patients presenting with a VHF-like illness for EVD and Lassa fever. No cases of EVD have been detected using ebolavirus PCR assays while 10 patients have been confirmed with a Lassa fever virus infection. Lassa fever is endemic in Sierra Leone. 35 contacts [of EVD patients] have been traced; 15 have completed 21 days of follow-up and have been discharged from medical surveillance; and 20 are still under follow up.

EVD preparedness and response training has been provided to 375 health-care workers, including senior district-level nursing staff, primary health-care staff, senior hospital-based nurses and clinicians, and hospital superintendents. Personal protective equipment has been prepositioned in all district hospitals, selected private and mission hospitals, and the Armed Forces hospital. Active surveillance activities continue, including the investigation of all rumours of VHF-like illness.

WHO response
------------
WHO continues to support the Ministries of Health of Guinea and Liberia in their EVD prevention and control activities. As of 7 May 2014, 113 experts have been deployed to assist in the response. This includes 54 experts deployed through the global WHO surge mechanism, 33 international experts from among partner institutions of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), 10 externally recruited consultants and 16 WHO staff who were locally repurposed. Expertise has been mobilized in the areas of coordination, medical anthropology, clinical case management, data management and health informatics, surveillance and epidemiology, infection prevention and control, laboratory services, logistics, risk communications, social mobilization, finance and administration, and resource mobilization.

To date, 88 experts have been deployed to Guinea, 21 to Liberia, one to Sierra Leone, and 3 to the WHO Regional Office for Africa.

An additional 12 deployments are in the pipeline in the disciplines of medical anthropology, clinical case management, surveillance and epidemiology, laboratory services, logistics, and risk and media communications.

WHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea or Liberia based on the current information available for this event.

This update has also been posted on the regional website of the WHO African Regional Office.

[2] MSF statement 6 May 2014

Despite a remarkable reduction in the number of new EVD cases, the disease has not been totally eradicated in Guinea and medical teams are still alert to respond in case of any eventual outbreak, the communications officer for Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) Sam Taylor said on Monday [5 May 2014]. He said the search for people who had contact with Ebola patients was still going on.

"All stakeholders should continue to remain vigilant, ensuring that the population receive the correct information and that patients are rapidly taken to hospitals for medication," he added. He said medical teams were continuing to receive new patients in Conakry and Gueckedou, where MSF teams are working with officials from Guinea's health ministry to eradicate the disease. "We shall remain vigilant and will not say that the disease has been terminated," Taylor affirmed. EVD will only be declared as officially eradicated if there are no new cases reported within 42 days.

[3] Senegal preparedness

The Senegalese government today [7 May 2014] has declared it will maintain the maximum alert even though the EVD outbreak that has left about 100 people dead in Western Africa has been controlled [according to some reports]. Senegal's health minister Awa Marie Coll Seck has said the government cannot just assume is over, they have to remain alert, she said.

It not possible either to close the borders for months or years, the minister added, referring to the government's decision to open the country's borders, which had been closed due to the possible contagion coming from neighboring Guinea. However, this does not mean everyone can come and go with[out] the proper check-ups. Surveillance will remain in force at all land, maritime and air borders, she added.

Senegal has invested about USD 300 000 to fund an EVD prevention program, for the disease that appeared for the 1st time in Guinea earlier this year [2014] and expanded to Liberia and Sierra Leone.

[There have been no new probable or suspected cases reported from any of the 3 countries affected so far, so WHO updates are appearing at longer intervals than formerly -- the cut-off date for this one was 5 May 2014. But MSF said a day later that they are still admitting cases.

It is encouraging news that many contacts continue to be released from isolation after 21 days surveillance without showing symptoms.

I hope that serum specimens have been taken on discharge to be tested eventually for antibody indicating subclinical infection.

It is also encouraging to see that Senegal is taking preparedness seriously. - Mod.JW
