A mule deer buck killed on the west slope of the Bighorn Mountains has
tested positive for chronic wasting disease (CWD). The buck was killed last
month [September 2009] in hunt area 46, in the Shell Creek drainage about
14 miles east of the town of Shell.

The Wyoming Game and Fish Department says that the closest previously known
area with the disease was about 35 to 40 miles to the east, on the eastern
slope of the Bighorns.

The game department says major health organizations have said the risk of
humans contracting disease from infected wildlife appears to be low.
However, they say that people shouldn't eat animals that look sick or that
test positive for chronic wasting disease.

[This seems to represent an expansion of the disease in Wyoming.

Chronic wasting disease (CWD) has been known as a clinical syndrome of mule
deer (_Odocoileus hemionus_) for more than 30 years; modelling suggests the
disease may have been present in free-ranging populations of mule deer for
more than 40 years. Only 4 species of the family _Cervidae_ are known to be
naturally susceptible to CWD: mule deer, white-tailed deer (_Odocoileus
virginianus_), Shiras moose (_Alces alces shirasi_), and Rocky Mountain elk
(_Cervus elaphus nelsoni_), though it is very likely that other subspecies
of _C. elaphus_ are susceptible to CWD. Susceptibility of other cervids to
CWD is not known. Cattle appear to be resistant to natural infection; to
date, only 3 of 13 cattle have become infected with the CWD agent following
experimental intracerebral inoculation, although this and other
experimental studies begun in 1997 are not yet completed. Susceptibility to
the CWD agent has been documented in sheep through intracerebral
inoculation, but no studies have been conducted to show that CWD can be
transmitted to sheep through oral exposure or other vectors (Williams
2005). The origin of CWD is not known, and it may never be possible to
definitively determine how or when CWD arose. Though of academic interest,
determining the origin is probably not very important from a management
perspective; nonetheless, speculation continues. Scrapie, a TSE of domestic
sheep, has been recognized in the United States since 1947, and it is
possible that CWD was derived from scrapie. Arguments can be made both for
and against this hypothesis. It is possible, though never proven, that deer
came into contact with the scrapie agent either on shared pastures or in
captivity somewhere along the front range of the Rocky Mountains, where
high levels of sheep grazing occurred in the early 1900s. In addition, in
vitro models suggest there is less of a species barrier to interspecies TSE
transmission between deer, elk, and sheep than between these cervids and
either cattle or humans. However, CWD has never been identified in other
areas of North America or other parts of the world where cervids and
domestic sheep with scrapie must have co-mingled. Strain typing experiments
determined that CWD is not like other known scrapie strains, though direct
comparisons with North American scrapie strains have not been conducted.
Experimental transmission of CWD to a domestic goat by intracerebral
inoculation had a prolonged incubation; shorter incubation would be
expected with scrapie strains in goats. Experimental scrapie in cattle and
lesions of CWD in cattle are quite different.

It may be possible that CWD is a spontaneous TSE that arose in deer in the
wild or in captivity and has biological features promoting transmission to
other deer and elk. The majority of human CJD cases are thought to be
spontaneous and associated with conformational change in a normal cellular
protein (PrPC) to the abnormal disease associated protease resistant
protein (PrPres), considered by many to be infectious agents of the TSEs.
Occurrence of spontaneous CJD is approximately one per one million
population per year. Spontaneous CWD may have happened in deer, though it
is difficult to see how this could be proven.

Surveillance of this disease is usually through hunter-killed animals.
While this news article seems to point to a minor expansion of the disease
in this area, it should be remembered that these animals have been living
with disease for decades, and attempts to wipe it out, such as has occurred
in Wisconsin, have been unsuccessful. It may well be that the best approach
is simply understanding through a passive surveillance where the disease is
located.
