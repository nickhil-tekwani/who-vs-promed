It is evident that we are seeing severe impacts on human health as a result
of a seemingly increased disregard for basic environmental sanitation. An
example of a recent shigellosis outbreak that would have been prevented if
established guidelines were being followed is attached for your interest.

An interactive water fountain at a new beachside park was shut down because
health officials received several reports of children becoming ill after
playing in it.
Paul Minshew, environmental manager of the Volusia County Health
Department, a division of the state Department of Health, said the fountain
at the new Sun Splash Park was closed last Friday.
"We were following up on some episodes of people reporting they were there
(at the park) and their children became ill," Minshew said.
He said his department recorded some positive cases of shigellosis, which
is a water- or food-borne bacterial disease. Most of the cases, all
involving children, occurred around the same period of time and all had
been visitors to the fountain at the park.
Volusia County Parks and Recreation Department did not submit plans for the
fountain to the Health Department prior to its construction. A recent
change in Florida's Administrative Health Code incorporates interactive
fountains under the same guidelines as public pools and spas.
Under those guidelines, plans for interactive fountains must be submitted
for approval to the Health Department ahead of time.
Minshew said he knows the chlorination of the fountain did not meet health
codes. "It was somewhere between 1 part per million of free chlorine
residual, which is adequate in swimming pools to kill bacteria and viruses
but not enough for the interactive fountains because of the reclaimed water
they use," he said. State health standards require 12 parts per million of
free chlorine residual in the water for interactive fountains.
Minshew said Parks and Recreation officials must submit their plans to the
Health Department. An engineer will review the plans and once they are
approved, the same engineer will inspect the fountain and make sure
everything is built as the plans indicated before allowing it to reopen.
