The veterinary services of Rybnitsa rayon [district] announced
quarantine in a village farm because of suspected swine anthrax cases.
The veterinarians have informed that the definitive diagnosis is
pending. This region was free of anthrax for a long time. A vaccine
campaign is planned to be implemented once the diagnosis of anthrax is
confirmed. The veterinarians urge the population to comply with the
possible vaccine program procedures.

The state laboratory of Transnistria has confirmed the case of anthrax
in swine in the Rybnitsa rayon. The affected animal was transferred to
a processing facility near the capital of Transnistria, where signs of
anthrax were detected. The originating farm and the processing
facility are under quarantine now. Disinfection and other outbreak
control measures have been carried out.

[The previous story reports the same case as suspected; within 3 days
the suspicion was confirmed. The authorities of the region are making
their maximal efforts to control the situation. They received 2000
doses of anthrax vaccine and immunized all the cattle and swine with
the exception of offspring. - Mod.NR]

[The authorities are to be congratulated on observing this outbreak
and their rapid confirmation. If, as they say, they have had
significant freedom from this disease, 2 thoughts come to mind,
pushing aside a normal skepticism, for this porcine outbreak:

1. pigs are scavengers and are sometimes fed viscera from dead animals
or, if grazing, will eviscerate an ovine or bovine carcass in the same
field; or

2. which is more likely, they were fed contaminated feed. This has
been happening with some frequency in Russia lately. Normally this is
only obvious in winter time when livestock are housed, but commercial
pigs can spend their whole lives housed and dependent on commercial
feed for their nourishment.

Normally pigs are moderately resistant to _Bacillus anthracis_
infections. When it occurs, oropharyngeal anthrax is the usual form
for pigs. Many years ago it was noted that when they are fed
contaminated feed in a smooth format, the spores go straight through
and the pigs remain healthy. But if the feed is mixed with a fibrous
mildly abrasive mix, they come down rapidly with the infection. - Mod

[The separatist region of Trans-Dniester (Pridnestrovye, Transnistria)
is a narrow strip of land between the Dniester river and the eastern
Moldovan border with Ukraine. It proclaimed independence from Moldova
in 1990 but is not recognized by the international community.
