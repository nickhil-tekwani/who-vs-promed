The number of people infected with "acute relaxation" [disease] in which paralysis appears in the limbs of children is rapidly increasing. [The disease] is one of infectious diseases in which the hands and feet of children suddenly [become paralyzed].

According to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, 86 ["acute relaxation"] infections have been reported since May [2018], of which 28 have been onset since October [2018], and the number of reports has increased rapidly in the past few weeks. The [disease starts] with symptoms similar to a cold, such as a fever, then [appears in] the limbs. One of the causes is infection with a virus called "enterovirus D68."

It is important to thoroughly wash hands every day as a precautionary measure [against the disease]. The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has continued warning and monitoring, as infections are rapidly increasing.

The number of reports of "acute relaxation" [disease], in which paralysis suddenly enters the limbs of children, has increased since around October [2018]. Reports of paralysis have been reported successively for 3 years, since the epidemic of enterovirus D68 infection. In May [2018], the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare asked for reports from medical institutions nationwide as well as strengthened monitoring. Connections are pointed out this time as well. Experts are calling for thorough washing and early consultation with medical institutions.

According to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, 9 cases were reported nationwide in the latest week [22-28 Oct 2018] [compared to a few cases per week]. Ten cases were reported the previous week. Kakoko Tashiya, head of the Center for Infectious Diseases Epidemiology, points out that "there are 10 cases in a week" and 86 cumulative since May [2018]. Infection with enterovirus D68 has been pointed out as a cause. It is related to a virus that causes polio and hand, foot & mouth disease, also called childhood paralysis. It is contagious with a [wet] cough and is most prevalent from summer to autumn.

There is only symptomatic treatment, and there is no vaccine to prevent infection. Since it takes time to examine pathogens, it is detected only from a [sample] of patients with paralysis at the present time. However, from medical institutions in various places this year, 26 cases of virus detection including respiratory illness were reported this month [November 2018]. Ryutaro Kira, chief of Pediatric Neurology at Fukuoka City Children's Hospital, who participates in the research group, said, "This illness is not fully known yet; if [the infection appears in] a limb after a symptom like a cold, consult a medical institution. Washing and gargling are indispensable for prevention."

[Like poliovirus and hand, foot & mouth disease (HFMD), only a small fraction of EV-D68 infection cases manifest neurological symptoms [Global emergence of enterovirus D68: a systematic review. Lancet Infect Dis 2016; 16: e64-75]. An earlier study by Chong et al. reported strong temporal correlation with EV-D68 detection from pathogen surveillance [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320264264_Clinical_Features_of_Acute_Flaccid_Myelitis_Temporally_Associated_With_an_Enterovirus_D68_Outbreak_Results_of_a_Nationwide_Survey_of_Acute_Flaccid_Paralysis_in_Japan_August-December_2015/download].

Early general clinical management of children with AFM should be intensive nursing for children with severe neurological disease, and physical and occupational therapy should be initiated as soon as the child is physically stable to optimize functional outcomes. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and/or pulse steroid therapy have been reported to have little impact on the final prognosis. - Mod.UBA
