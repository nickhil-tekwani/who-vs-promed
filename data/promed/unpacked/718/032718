Breeders' Cup monitoring outbreak, still planning Texas race
----------------------
Breeders' Cup officials are monitoring the outbreak of a contagious equine
disease at a far West Texas farm but said Wednesday they have not
considered moving the October race from Lone Star Park.
The track is about 500 miles from the farm near Balmorhea, where vesicular
stomatitis was found in 3 horses. No animals at Lone Star Park have shown
any signs of the disease.
"Our 1st intention continues for the race to be run at Lone Star Park,"
Breeders' Cup spokesman Jim Gluckson said. "We're just monitoring the
situation. We will continue to do that. It's important to point out that
this is an isolated case. ... It's not next door."
The Breeders' Cup, scheduled for 30 Oct 2004, is a one-day card of 8
thoroughbred races with $14 million in purses. The race is estimated
to have an economic impact of more than $30 million on the area.
Vesicular stomatitis is a rarely fatal viral disease that causes blisters
to form in the animal's mouth and on teats or hooves. It can affect horses,
cattle, pigs, and occasionally sheep, goats and deer.
Gluckson said Breeders' Cup officials were staying in contact about the
situation with the Texas Animal Health Commission, U.S. agricultural
officials and Lone Star Park.
Ronald Box, a Pecos veterinarian who diagnosed and reported the Balmorhea
outbreak, said the 3 horses were recovering from the disease. Texas Animal
Health Commission officials said the infected animals have not been off the
farm in several months.
"We're going to monitor the situation and do a thorough investigation on
every horse currently stabled at Lone Star and every horse that travels to
Lone Star," track president Corey Johnsen said. "In a month or 2, we hope
this is under control."
Kentucky's state veterinarian has indefinitely banned all Texas livestock
from entering that state because of the outbreak.
Lone Star Park is spending about $8 million to prepare the facility for the
event. Some of the renovations have already begun. The event is expected to
bring a crowd of about 50 000.
Changing the site of a Breeders' Cup has happened in the past. But
locations that have lost the Breeders' Cup have been allowed to host the
races another year.
Churchill Downs was selected to host the event this year, but it was moved
to Lone Star Park a year early because of an expansion project at Churchill.

Kentucky Governor Eases VS Restrictions (from Lone Star Park report)
--------------------
Kentucky Governor Ernie Fletcher issued an emergency regulation late
Thursday changing the restrictions on Texas livestock entering Kentucky
that were imposed because of a vesicular stomatitis (VS). The emergency
regulations will allow livestock from most of Texas, including horses from
Lone Star Park, to enter Kentucky under certain conditions.
Governor Fletcher's emergency regulation amends the 1998 law that resulted
in a ban of all livestock coming into Kentucky from states affected by VS.
"I have signed an order that minimizes the impact of the ban on the
Kentucky livestock industry while maintaining adequate protections for
Kentucky animals," Governor Fletcher stated in a press release.
The ruling paves the way for Kentucky horsemen to reconsider shipping their
horses to Lone Star Park for Monday's 6th annual Lone Star Million. In
order to return to Kentucky, horses must have a negative VS test within the
30-day period preceding entry into Kentucky.
"This is extremely positive news," said Jeff Greco, Lone Star general manager.
Greco said that officials in Lone Star Park's racing office were "working
tirelessly" Thursday evening to communicate the news to Kentucky-based
horsemen.
On Wednesday, Texas Racing Commission veterinarians completed examinations
of 1,450 horses stabled at Lone Star Park in Grand Prairie, Texas. None
showed signs of VS.
VS can affect horses, cattle, pigs, and occasionally, sheep, goats and
deer, causing blisters to form in the animal's mouth or along the hooves.
On May 19, the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa,
confirmed that 3horses on a ranch in a remote and sparsely populated area
near Balmorhea, Texas, had clinical signs of VS.
All livestock on the affected ranch, located approximately 480 miles
southwest of Lone Star Park near the New Mexico border, will remain
quarantined for several weeks.
Greco said that all horses that enter the Lone Star Park stable area will
be examined by Texas licensed veterinarians to eliminate concerns about VS.
