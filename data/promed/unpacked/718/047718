Date: 21 May 2001
From: Soren Alexandersen <soren.alexandersen@bbsrc.ac.uk>

We have noted the information provided by Dr RS Breeze about the plans of
the United States Department of Agriculture to develop certain tests.
Subscribers may be interested in the experiences of the OIE/FAO World
Reference Laboratory (WRL) for foot and mouth disease (FMD) at the
Institute for Animal Health, Pirbright, United Kingdom with reverse
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology.
In its capacity as the WRL for FMD, Pirbright receives diagnostic samples
from all over the world and has processed all the samples submitted for
laboratory analyses in the UK's 2001 epidemic (currently totaling more than
9500 epithelial tissue and blood samples). Many more blood samples have
been tested by an antibody assay.
The laboratory has the world's largest collection of FMD reference samples
and the largest data bank of FMDV sequences. Investigation of suspected FMD
samples at the WRL is done by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and
cell culture. If the amount of virus is high it can be detected in a very
short time (3 to 4 hours). Samples found negative in ELISA are passaged in
highly sensitive bovine thyroid cells (BTY). Two 48-hour passages are
completed before a final negative result is given.
Any cell cultures showing cytopathology are tested by ELISA. However,
around 1 month after the start of the outbreak the average turn-around time
for a positive sample was 24 hours. Regular PCR has been used in the WRL
for several years but mainly for research purposes. This is because careful
comparisons with routine 'conventional' diagnostic procedures have shown
[that PCR methods are sometimes less sensitive. Consequently, PCR
technology has been employed to support and not to replace primary
diagnosis by ELISA/BTY virus isolation.
Almost 2 years ago a real time PCR technique was developed at the WRL
(1;2). The objective was to develop an assay that would detect certain
strains of FMDV. This it did remarkably well. A year later we developed a
slightly modified assay, which was tested with 60 different isolates across
all 7 serotypes. Again, the results were very encouraging as they could be
obtained with a very high sensitivity and specificity. The time for testing
was about 4-5 hours after the receipt of a sample. A paper describing these
results is in preparation for publication.

[The average turn around time of a positive test was 24 hours, after the
outbreak had a month to get a grip. Furthermore, this time does not include
transit time of the sample. The number of animals destroyed could have been
reduced with an accurate cow-side test. Â­ Mod.TG
