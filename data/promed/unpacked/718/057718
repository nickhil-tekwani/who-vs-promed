The National Institute of Health (INS) stated that the cases of Zika virus infection in Colombia have now reached 393, of which more than 11 percent of the cases (44) are reported in Norte de Santander [department].

According to the Institute, most of those affected in the region are registered in Cucuta, with 16 cases, followed by the municipalities of El Zulia, Puerto Santander, San Cayetano, Tibu and Villa del Rosario.

"Following the confirmation of Zika virus circulation in the country, and as a result of intensified surveillance work on diseases with rash by the INS virology laboratory, as of epidemiological week 44 [week ending 7 Nov 2015] it has been possible to laboratory confirm a total of 393 virus positive cases, distributed in 23 of the 36 units in the territory," the Institute stated.

[Zika virus infections continue to increase both in case numbers as well as in geographic area in Colombia. Laboratory confirmation is essential, because the symptoms of Zika, chikungunya, and dengue viruses are similar enough that diagnosis on clinical grounds is difficult, and these viruses are all co-circulating in the departments mentioned. The Vice Minister's earlier statement is likely to be correct -- Zika virus will probably spread to 17 departments, all of which have _Aedes aegypti_ populations abundant enough to transmit these viruses. It will be interesting to see whether Zika virus spreads to the neighboring countries of Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela, and Panama.
