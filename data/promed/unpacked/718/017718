The Institute of Public Health is studying a possible case of [a] hantavirus [infection]. This incident involves an older man, resident of the Valle Verde locality, located 10 km [6 miles] from Puerto Aysen, and constitutes the 4th case of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome this year [2016].

The affected individual has a mild clinical case according to the Regional Health Administration person, Silvia Delfin, and is in a good condition, being evaluated by the health team in the Regional Hospital. "We are awaiting confirmation of this hantavirus [infection] case by the Institute of Public Health, which should be provided mid-week. Mainly, a team from the Regional Health Administration made a visit to [the patient's] home and found evidence of rodents," she said.

Concerning preventive measures for hantavirus [infection], Delfin restated the announcement to the community to adopt habits for dealing with trash and hygiene at home. "Our reminder is always to take strict measures for trash in those areas in and around where they live. We have important measures that they can adopt that are related to food materials and the overnight areas. These places must be maintained clean, with food materials covered so that the rodents that come into houses do not have access to them, and because of this, it is important to close all openings where they can come in," she indicated.

[The Aysen (Aisen) region, like much of central and southern Chile, is endemic for Andes hantavirus. The above report provides little information about the circumstances under which the man acquired his hantavirus infection, but it may have been due to exposure to rodent reservoir hosts of the virus or to virus-contaminated rodent excreta. Cases of human hantavirus infections occur fairly frequently in the endemic region of the central and southern coastal areas of Chile.

Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and then only with very close physical contact, usually within the family.

Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg.
