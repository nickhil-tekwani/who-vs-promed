Thousands of freshwater drum were floating belly up between Parkersburg and
Vienna, Virginia (US) Tuesday, but what killed them doesn't appear to have
been from the hands of [humans. Department of Natural Resources Wildlife
Resources Chief Bernie Dowler says the agency hasn't been able to locate
any point source of pollution that may produce the deadly bacteria that
killed the fish. That bacteria apparently were already present in their
bodies.
