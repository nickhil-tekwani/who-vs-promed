Australia's 1st victim of a killer strain of drug-resistant tuberculosis [TB] has died amid warnings of a looming health epidemic on Queensland's doorstep. Medical experts are seriously concerned about the handling of the TB epidemic in Papua New Guinea [PNG] after [a woman] died last Thursday [14 Mar 2013] of an incurable form of the illness, known as XDR-TB (extensively drug resistant TB) in Cairns Base Hospital. The 20-year-old had been in an isolation ward since May last year [2012] after an outbreak of the highly contagious mutated form of TB on Daru Island [Western Province, Papua New Guinea], off Cape York [Peninsula, Far North Queensland].

Some doctors fear she will become the 1st of a wave medical refugees heading to Queensland for treatment. The State's Chief Health officer Jeanette Young has urged people not to panic about the threat of an outbreak on the mainland. But respiratory physician Steve Vincent, who treated Ms Abraham, warned that there was a further threat of totally drug resistant or TDR-TB "just around the corner". "Her death is not unexpected given the fallout of this killer, incurable disease," Dr Vincent said. "Despite all the 1st-world medical treatment, it shows how difficult it is to control. It exemplifies the fact with such a high mortality rate, PNG is going to have an extremely difficult time in handling this epidemic." He said doctors may soon face the ethical dilemma where it might be "more humane not to treat them and let them die" as the disease was untreatable.

Australian and Papua New Guinean authorities are trying to contain XDR-TB to the shantytowns of Daru Island as more than 14 500 TB cases are diagnosed in PNG's Western Province every year. Federal MP Warren Entsch, whose electorate includes the Torres Strait, yesterday [14 Mar 2013] said the AUD 31 million [about USD 32.5 million] AusAid TB program in the Western Province was "riddled with corruption" and "completely inadequate". He said [the 20-year-old woman from PNG]'s death was a grim reminder of the "looming public health disaster on our doorstep."

XDR-TB is estimated to cost between AUD 500 000 [about USD 525 000] and AUD 1 million [about USD 1.05 million] a patient to treat in Australian hospitals, with a low cure rate and high death rate. Dr Young said she supported efforts to contain the epidemic to the PNG side of the border and not reopen clinics on the Torres Strait islands of Boigu or Saibai. She said re-opening health clinics on Boigu or Saibai islands would only increase the risk of cross-border infection in the Torres Strait.

[The news report above of the death of a 20-year-old woman with XDR-TB from Papua New Guinea, who had been hospitalized in Queensland, is a follow-up on a prior ProMED-mail post Tuberculosis - Australia: (QL) ex Papua New Guinea archive no 20121020.1355085.

The following has been mostly extracted from moderator ML's comments in a prior ProMED-mail post Tuberculosis, MDR - Papua New Guinea 20080206.0478:

Papua New Guinea (PNG), which gained its independence from Australia in 1975, is called officially the Independent State of Papua New Guinea. It occupies the eastern half of the island of New Guinea and numerous offshore islands. (The Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Papua occupy the western portion of the island of New Guinea). The majority of the PNG's population of about 6.3 million lives in traditional societies and practices subsistence-based agriculture (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea).

The Torres Strait Islands, which Australia officially annexed in 1879, are situated in the Torres Strait between mainland Australia (Queensland) and PNG (http://www.abc.net.au/ra/pacific/places/country/torres_strait_islands.htm). The Torres Strait Islands Treaty signed by Australia and PNG allows for free movement of people (without passports or visas) between the Torres Strait Islands and PNG for traditional activities. The Torres Strait Islanders, who are culturally akin to the coastal peoples of PNG, became citizens of Queensland, Australia in 1967 with full access to health and social services and freedom to travel and work in Australia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islanders). Many thousands of Torres Strait Islanders are said to live in Queensland today.

A publication in the Medical Journal of Australia (MJA) (http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/188_03_040208/gil10334_fm.html) reviewed the molecular epidemiology of MDR-TB strains isolated from patients living in the Western Province of PNG, who sought treatment between 2000 and 2006 in the Torres Strait Islands because of limited access to health care in the Western Province of PNG. Of the 60 TB isolates, 15 (25 percent) were MDR. Because travel from PNG to the Torres Strait Islands is difficult and costly, only the more affluent and in better clinical condition likely made the trip. Nevertheless, of the 15 patients with MDR-TB, 6 were known to have died and 2 were presumed to have died. The MJA article states that none were XDR-TB. Genotyping identified in 14 of the 15 isolates a single type ("Beijing-family"), said to be the most prevalent type in Southeast Asia. The frequency of MDR-TB in PNG is unknown; however, the authors say that in the past 2 years 30 MDR-TB strains have been identified in Australia, with one 3rd originating from the Western province of PNG.

An accompanying editorial in the MJA (https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2008/188/3; subscription required) noted that to reduce TB among immigrants to Australia from neighboring high-incidence countries, Australia should fund expansion of clinical and laboratory TB control in these neighboring countries (see also for an article relevant to the US, Schwartzman K, Oxlade O, Barr RG et al: Domestic returns from investment in the control of tuberculosis in other countries. N Engl J Med 2005; 353(10): 1008-20; available at http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa043194).

The annual incidence of TB in PNG is estimated to be 233 per 100 000 population and TB is one of its 3 leading causes of death (http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/188_03_040208/gil10334_fm.html). As a point of reference, according to the US CDC, the annual incidence of TB in the US in 2011 was 3.4 cases per 100 000 population (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6111a2.htm).

We are not told if this 20-year-old woman from PNG with XDR-TB was HIV co-infected. TB is a major problem for people whose immune system is disabled by HIV/AIDS. Although HIV/TB co-infection has not been considered a problem in Australia, PNG has the highest incidence of HIV infection in the Pacific region; it is estimated that 2 percent of the adult population of PNG, approximately 64 000 people, are HIV-positive (http://www.ausaid.gov.au/Publications/Documents/impacts_hiv.pdf).

In recognition of the threat that HIV poses for PNG, Australia is incorporating HIV prevention and education components into all its PNG aid projects, which is being complemented by key partnerships with international HIV/AIDS partners and the private sector, such as, the Clinton Foundation HIV/AIDS initiative, the Asian Development Bank, and the Asian Pacific Business Coalition on HIV/AIDS (http://www.ausaid.gov.au/country/png/hivaids.cfm).
