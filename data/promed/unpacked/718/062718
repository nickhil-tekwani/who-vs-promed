[background history: This site was first developed for joint USSR-Germany
field trials in the late 1920s and then, when Germany pulled out of their
joint military programs with the USSR in 1931-33, by the USSR alone; these
joint programmes covered flight training for the Luftwaff, tank training,
and Chemical warfare & Biological warfare (BW). It has a very long history

Ozrozhdeniye Island, Uzbekistan -- In the spring of 1988, germ scientists
850 miles east of Moscow were ordered to undertake their most critical
mission. Working in great haste and total secrecy, the scientists in the
city of Sverdlovsk transferred hundreds of tons of anthrax bacteria --
enough to destroy the world many times over -- into giant stainless-steel
canisters, poured bleach into them to decontaminate the deadly pink powder,
packed the canisters onto a train 24 cars long and sent the illicit cargo
almost a thousand miles across Russia and Kazakhstan to this remote island
in the heart of the inland Aral Sea, American and Central Asian officials
say. Here Russian soldiers dug huge pits and poured the sludge into the
ground, burying the germs and, Moscow hoped, a grave political threat.
While Mikhail S. Gorbachev was pressing his glasnost and perestroika
campaign and warming ties with the West, intelligence evidence was mounting
in Washington that the Soviet Union, contrary to its treaty pledges, was
producing tons of deadly germs for weapons that the world had banned. The
stockpile had to be destroyed in case the United States and Britain
demanded an inspection, Russian scientists close to the program said.
Vozrozhdeniye Island was a natural choice. Until the military left here for
good in 1992, Renaissance Island, as it translates from the Russian, had
been the Soviet Union's major open-air testing site. Today, Renaissance
Island, which the former Soviet republics of Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan now
share, is the world's largest anthrax burial ground. For the United States,
it is an intelligence gold mine. At the invitation of Uzbekistan and
Kazakhstan, American military scientists and intelligence experts have
secretly been traveling here for the past 4 years -- most recently last
October -- to survey the island and take samples of the buried bacteria,
according to senior Uzbek and American officials. What they have found is
stunning, the experts say.
Tests of soil samples from 6 of 11 vast burial pits show that, although the
anthrax was soaked in bleach at least twice, once inside the 66-gallon
containers and again after it was dumped into the sandy pits and buried for
a decade under 3-to-5 feet of sand, some of the spores are still alive --
and potentially deadly.
Tests on the samples performed by American military laboratories have shown
the anthrax vaccine now being given, in 6 shots and a yearly booster, to
2.4 million Americans in uniform is effective against the Russian strain of
this ancient, deadly scourge -- at least the strain found on the island.
While this has reassured the Clinton administration, the discovery of live
spores has alarmed Kazakhstan and especially worries Uzbekistan, which has
been exploring for oil on the two-thirds of the island it controls. Because
the Aral Sea is shrinking -- the result of wrongheaded Soviet irrigation
policies -- this now-deserted, isolated island has grown from 77 square
miles to 770 and will soon be connected to the mainland. Uzbek and Kazakh
experts fear the buried anthrax spores could escape their sandy tomb,
stirred up by carriers like gophers and other rodents, lizards and birds,
and be brought to Uzbek and Kazakh territory. The disease is spread from
animals to people by direct contact; it is treatable with antibiotics if
detected immediately. As a weapon, it would be disbursed as an aerosol, for
inhalation.
Central Asian and American officials fear, as access to the island eases,
the buried anthrax could be used by terrorists to make more of the deadly
agent. In addition, officials said, exposure to the spores could add a new
threat to a population whose health is already considered abysmal.
International medical experts are just starting to assess which of their
many chronic ailments are attributable to poverty and environmental
degradation and which might be linked to the region's biological and
chemical legacy.
