Home canning is regaining popularity as part of the local food movement. If done right, families can enjoy home grown fruits, vegetables and even meat all through the winter. But if done wrong, it can be devastating, if not deadly. A man from the state of Washington recently learned that lesson the hard way.

On the Friday before Mother's Day [10 May 2013], he was looking forward to spending the weekend with his wife at their home in the Seattle area. During the week, he lives alone in Olympia [Thurston County] where he works. But he woke that morning with the strangest affliction: double vision. "There were 2 of everything and I had an awful time just shaving and getting ready for work," he said. He suspected the double vision was related to some laser eye surgery he recently had. He managed to make it into work, but soon went home. That evening, he experienced more strange symptoms. "My legs felt rubbery," he said.

The next morning, he felt even worse. He was bumping into walls. He called his wife. "I told her, 'You know, I'm going to stop by the ER on the way up just so somebody can tell me I'm okay and I'm not having a stroke,'" he said.

At the hospital, that's exactly what they thought he was having. He heard "stroke in progress" called over the intercom. Suddenly he was surrounded by nurses and doctors. Test results started coming back. There was no evidence of stroke. "I didn't know enough to bring up the fact that I had eaten canned meat," he said.

Canned meat. You see, the night before the man woke up with double vision, he had eaten some elk meat from a hunting trip. He canned it himself about a week earlier. "Borrowed a pressure cooker, used an old family recipe for canning," he said. His mother had canned everything when he was a kid. He wanted to recapture a bit of his childhood. But things started going wrong from the start. "I had way too much meat to deal with," he said. The pressure cooker was too small. He had already browned the meat in a cast iron pan. So he decided to shortcut the process. Once the jars sealed airtight he would take them out of the pressure cooker and start a new batch.

The next day, he heard a pop in the pantry -- "which I remember as a child was the signal for you've lost the seal," he said. He found the jar with the popped seal, put it in the fridge and ate it the next day. He says it was delicious. The following week he heard another lid pop. Just as he had before, He found the jar and stuck it in the fridge. And a few days later he ate it for supper. "This time, it didn't work out," he said.

The man had an upset stomach in the night, but he didn't connect it to having eaten the meat. He says growing up, he didn't know anyone who got food poisoning from home canned foods. At the hospital, once doctors ruled out a stroke, the man was sent home. But he was back in the hospital a few hours later. Now he was having difficulty swallowing. The next morning, Mother's Day, his daughter drove to Olympia to see her dad.

"His voice was very slurred and his eyelids were droopy, but he was sitting up in bed and he was communicative," she said. As the day progressed though, his condition got markedly worse. "By now, my eyes were closed. My strength -- it was just amazing how quickly that went," he said.

His breathing was getting shallow. The daughter was frustrated with the lack of answers and scared. She called a doctor she knew, a neurosurgeon. He ran through a short checklist of things to rule out. That list included a disease 1st identified in the 18th century: botulism. She looked it up online. "It just made the hair on the back of my neck stand up because it was every single symptom just laid out exactly what my dad was experiencing," she said.

Botulism is a paralyzing illness caused by what the CDC calls the most potent toxin known to science. It's rare; there were only 20 foodborne cases nationwide in 2011, and just one in Washington state in 2012. Improperly home canned foods are a leading culprit, especially those low in acid like green beans and, yes, meats. The daughter called her mom who had just left the hospital. "And I said, 'Mom, turn around. You got to go back and tell them to look into this,'" she said.

The daughter was relieved, but also terrified that it was too late. Her father could hardly move now. He was having more and more difficulty breathing. The hospital had parked a ventilator outside his room. The doctors didn't even wait to confirm botulism. They ordered a dose of anti-toxin from the CDC. Now the medical mystery was solved. But how did the patient get botulism?

Remember he stopped cooking the jars of elk meat when he heard the seals lock in place. Washington State University food safety expert Zena Edwards says that was his nearly fatal mistake. Edwards says what happened to the man reaffirms 2 cardinal rules of home canning: "plan before you can" and "when it doubt, throw it out."

After receiving the anti-toxin, he was transferred to Swedish Hospital in Seattle for rehab. It took just days for the botulism to paralyze him. The recovery would be painfully slow. "My eyes were the 1st thing to come back. I still walk with difficulty and use a cane. I have no taste with the exception of chocolate, so I buy chocolate Ensure, chocolate mints; and [the] night before last, I found where they sell chocolate wine so I had some of that, too," he said.

[Especially in the absence of an appropriate history of food ingestion, there are other neurological diseases that can be considered in the differential diagnosis of this man's illness such as Guillain-Barre syndrome and myasthenia gravis. That said, if the story is accurate, it appears that not only was the man not experienced in home canning; but also, the health care facility and its physicians were not experienced in the diagnosis of botulism.

Classically, botulism is a foodborne disease caused by the ingestion of preformed toxin, although there also exists wound botulism (in which _Clostridium botulinum_ spores germinate in a wound), and infant botulism (in which the spores germinate in the intestinal tract). There are a number of types of botulism toxins that are immunologically distinct and work at a variety of sites of the neuromuscular junction to block acetylcholine neuromuscular transmission. - Mod.LL
