There were only 18 reported rabies cases in Ontario during 2014, all in bats
--------------------
This is the 1st year since rabies became established in Ontario in the 1950s that there has not been a single reported terrestrial case. This is a remarkable accomplishment. The last confirmed terrestrial case in southern Ontario was in June 2012. Based on World Organisation for Animal Health guidelines, southern Ontario can now be declared free of Arctic-strain rabies.

The approximately 35 percent decrease in rabies cases from 2013 to 2014 is not unexpected. It is after all only a difference of 10 rabid bats. The decline may be a result of the decreased number of submissions (submissions were slightly less than half of what they were in 2013) or of the change in rabies responsibilities between the federal and provincial governments.

During the transition of collecting potential rabid animals from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency to the health units and the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, there was a period of time when not all areas had staff trained to collect and ship suspect rabid animals.

The rabid bats from 2014 were distributed throughout the province - Ottawa-Carleton (1), Frontenac (1), Leeds-Greensville (1), Peterborough (2), Durham (1), Waterloo (2), Huron(1), Wentworth (1), Brant (1), Niagara(3), Elgin (1), and Middlesex (3).

[In the original document there is a map with the points where the rabid bats were found and a table with details by county. There is also detailed information on oral vaccination efforts during 2014. Eradication of terrestrial rabies through this work is a fantastic achievement.

Regarding cases in bats, genetic evidence suggests that rabies is an old disease for them in the New World. Bats from most of the estimated 41 bat species in the United States, when sampled in sufficient numbers, have been found to be infected with rabies virus. Rabies viruses recovered from bats were shown to be distinct from those recovered from terrestrial mammals, suggesting that these viruses evolved within their bat hosts. Bat rabies viruses are genetically diverse, exhibiting mutations characteristic to each host bat species. These data suggest that rabies viruses are maintained in animal populations predominantly through intraspecific transmission. That is, transmission rarely occurs between species, such as when a rabid bat infects a human. These "spillover events" generally are not perpetuated in the recipient species.
