Measles outbreaks in London, United Kingdom - preliminary report
----------------------------------------------------------------
2007 saw the highest number of measles cases reported in England and
Wales since current surveillance began in 1995, with 971 confirmed
cases reported, compared with 740 reported in 2006(1). London was the
region with the highest number of cases, and a large outbreak of
measles in north-east London contributed to this high number of
cases(2). There were several outbreaks of measles elsewhere in Europe
in 2007, and case have been reported this year in Switzerland(3),
France(4) and Denmark(5). Measles also continues to circulate in the
greater London area during 2008. In Lewisham, a local authority area
in south-east London, there has been a marked increase in cases so
far during 2008.

A total of 19 laboratory-confirmed and 63 probable measles cases have
been reported in Lewisham between 1 Jan 2008 and 8 Apr 2008. This
compares with provisional figures of fewer than 20 cases for the
whole of 2007. There have been a number of outbreaks this year,
including one in the local hospital, where 9 cases were linked to a
child admitted to the paediatric ward. This child subsequently
developed measles. Cases are being seen in all age groups, although
children younger than 5 years old are particularly affected, with 6
confirmed and 18 probable cases. There are ongoing outbreaks in 2
schools, reflected in the number of cases in 10-19 year olds, with 9
confirmed and 29 probable cases. There have been 4 probable cases in
people older than 20 years. A representative strain has been
genotyped, and is identical to MVs/Enfield.GBR/14.07 genotype D4
(GenBank EF 600554) (Health Protection Agency, Virus Reference
Department, Centre for Infections).

Lewisham, along with many parts of London, has historically had a low
uptake of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Coverage of
the 1st dose of MMR vaccine in 2-year-olds during 2006-07 was 67
percent(6) and for 2 doses of MMR in 5-year-olds was only 48 percent.
The recorded coverage for the September 2007 quarter was 64 percent.
Although it is likely that the uptake is in fact higher than this,
due to problems in ensuring data accuracy, the uptake remains well
below the 95 percent target.

There are several factors likely to have contributed to the low
uptake in this area. Traditionally, these include socio-economic
factors, such as high population mobility, family size, chronically
ill children in the family, affecting access to services. Lewisham is
an inner-city area with high levels of deprivation. There are
increasing signs that the middle classes in the United Kingdom may
also now be an at-risk group(7,8), due to parents' active decisions
not to immunise their children with the MMR vaccine. Anecdotal
evidence from the follow-up of individual cases in Lewisham by the
South East London Health Protection Unit suggests that some parents
of cases had also taken this decision.

Control measures
---------------------
The local health authority, Lewisham Primary Care Trust, has declared
a major community outbreak and is putting in place a range of control
measures, supported by the Health Protection Unit. These include
raising awareness in the population; encouraging MMR uptake with
proactive media releases; dissemination of information to schools and
nurseries in the area, including advice on exclusion; alerting health
professionals; and offering MMR at additional community clinics. The
overall aim is to increase MMR uptake in children in Lewisham both in
the short and longer term.

[Low vaccine uptake, whether as a consequence of social deprivation
or conscious decision on the part of parents, is contributing to the
resurgence of measles even in well-resourced communities. This report
records another instance of the role of health care facilities in the
transmission of measles.
