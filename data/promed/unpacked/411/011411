Disease experts calm fears of BSE in sheep
------------------------------------------
Scientists believe that test results which sparked fears that a form
of BSE, so-called "mad cow disease," had spread to British sheep are
important but not conclusive.
Initial results in the tests, published 2 years ago, found that 52
samples out of nearly 30 000 showed signs of scrapie -- but a
double-check test failed to back up those findings, leaving 28
samples unclassified. Experts are assessing whether the testing
method was flawed, whether the original results of scrapie -- a
naturally occurring BSE-like sheep disease not believed to threaten
humans -- was correct, or whether the samples were BSE-infected. The
test used initially is formally approved by the EU for use on cattle,
not sheep.
The spongiform encephalopathy advisory committee met this week to
discuss the findings and agreed it was vital to resolve the
discrepancies.
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the human form of BSE, has killed 136
people in Britain.

[These continental European countries, with relatively high number of
BSE cases, provide on-line information on year of birth. Most cases
were born in 1995/97:
Ireland: 1993-1996 (83.3 percent)
Italy: 1995-1997 (73.7 percent)
France: 1994-1997 (88.4 percent)
Germany: 1996-1999 (79.4 percent)
Spain: 1995-1998 (84.3 percent)
The relatively younger age of BSE-affected bovines in Germany may be
an indication that BSE contamination of animal feed has prevailed
there at least until 1999. - Mod.AS]

Researchers Develop Faster, More Accurate Test For Mad Cow Disease
--------------------------------------------------
As U.S. consumers seek reassurance that their hamburgers and steaks
are free of deadly mad cow disease, researchers at the University of
California-San Francisco say they may have found a promising
solution. They've developed a faster, more reliable test for
identifying the disease, possibly even in living cows [see comment].
Current tests can detect the disease only after the cow dies.
The test was described today at the 226th national meeting of the
American Chemical Society, the world's largest scientific society.
Critics argue that the standard immunoassay tests used to identify
the infectious prion proteins that cause mad cow disease are
inadequate for large-scale screening of cattle. The tests can produce
false readings and may take a week to yield results. A better test is
needed, they say.
The new test has already undergone animal studies. Called the
conformation-dependent immunoassay (CDI), it can detect prion
proteins with 100 percent accuracy at much lower levels than
conventional tests and only takes about 5 hours to produce results,
according to the UCSF researchers.
Like conventional tests, the new test is designed for detecting
prions in the brain tissue of cows only upon autopsy. Unlike other
tests, however, the new test also shows promise for detecting the
proteins in muscle tissue and even blood while the animal is still
alive. If so, it could be used to identify precisely which animals
are infected before they show symptoms and could help end the current
practice of slaughtering whole herds, the scientists say.
"This represents a new generation of prion tests," says project
leader Dr. Jiri G. Safar, M.D., an associate adjunct professor at
UCSF. He says the test has been used in a field trial to check for
signs of the disease in the brains of 11 000 slaughtered cows in
Spain, the United Kingdom, and Germany. Results were compared to
those from standard immunoassays performed on the same animals. There
were no discrepancies between the tests, he says.
"We had a perfect score. There were no false positives and no false
negatives," says Safar. "We can't afford incorrect conclusions, and
we didn't see that in our tests."
He says that the research group plans to use the test on an even
larger scale among European cattle herds within the next year,
checking them for signs of the disease upon autopsy. If further tests
prove successful, he hopes it will eventually be used to evaluate
dead cows in the US for mad cow disease, also known as bovine
spongiform encephelopathy, or BSE.
Despite the fact that the CDI test is currently being done in dead
cattle, Safar says the same test could eventually be used on live
animals to determine the presence of prions. In lab tests, the
researcher has used the CDI test to detect prions in the muscles of
living mice.
With the recent detection of mad cow disease in neighboring Canada
and the temporary ban on beef imported from that country, critics
have stepped up their call for better testing. To date, there has
never been a case of mad cow disease detected in the U.S. Given the
flaws of current testing, however, some experts believe it could be
just a matter of time.

[We don't normally post press releases about products before their
market approval. Promising results of TSE tests in live animals in
past experiments have not yet yielded approved field applications
(see item [3] in posting 20001219.2225). However, given the recent
BSE occurrence in Canada and the discussed need for enhanced BSE
testing in North America, this (abridged) information might be of
some value.
The European Commission has approved 5 rapid BSE tests for use in
mass testing, which is compulsory within the EU for slaughtered
cattle older than 30 months (in some countries, 24 months). 3 tests
were evaluated and approved in 1999: Prionics Check Western, Bio-Rad
TeSeE (previously Bio-Rad Platelia), and Enfer BSE test. In 2003, 2
additional tests have been approved following a laboratory evaluation
and a field trial: Prionics Check LIA and InPro CDI-5. All tests were
designed to detect BSE in brain material collected from animals at
the slaughterhouse or which have died on the farm. All of them are
also provisionally approved to detect TSE in sheep and goats, pending
a formal evaluation. So far, tests designed to detect BSE in live
animals have not been evaluated by the EU scientific steering
committee (See item [4] in posting 20030624.1557).
During 2002, a total of 10 423 882 bovine, 353 330 ovine, and 54 444
caprine animals were tested in the framework of EU's TSE monitoring
programme. Outside Europe, mass testing of bovines is carried out in
Japan and Israel. - Mod.AS]
