[1] Eyespot, grey leaf spot - Iowa, Nebraska

Alison Robertson, Iowa State University Extension plant pathologist,
has been scouting corn fields. Eyespot is the "disease of this
summer" -- so far -- in 2009. "Eyespot loves wet and cool weather so
it is probably not surprising that the disease is especially
prevalent this year [2009]. If such weather continues, we can expect
the disease to spread," says Robertson. Early and severe eyespot can
result in yield loss on susceptible corn hybrids. Furthermore,
increased [bacterial] stalk rot severity is associated with severe
eyespot disease.

Gray leaf spot (GLS) is now starting to show up on the lower leaves
of susceptible corn hybrids across the state of Iowa. Tamra Jackson,
Extension Plant Pathologist at University of Nebraska-Lincoln,
reported GLS is highly prevalent at this time in Nebraska, occurring
slightly earlier than normal in that state, and the severity is
increasing.

"Here in Iowa, the disease is perhaps a little ahead of schedule,"
says Robertson. "GLS infections in June and early July were
associated with the epidemics of GLS in Iowa in the mid 1990s." GLS
can result in considerable yield loss particularly when the disease
spreads to leaves above the ear soon after tasseling. High GLS
severity may also increase the risk of stalk rot.

[2] Crazy top - Iowa

The Plant Disease and Insect Diagnostic Clinic at Iowa State
University recently received some corn plant samples with symptoms
and signs of crazy top, a disease caused by [the fungus]
_Sclerophthora macrospora_. Symptoms of this disease vary greatly
with time of infection and degree of host colonization by the
pathogen. Generally, excessive tillering, rolling and twisting of the
upper leaves appear first. Later, infected plants produce a "leafy"
tassel. Flooding is how disease spores can infect corn. Diseased
grasses may also be a source of inoculum. Although seed transmission
of the pathogen has been demonstrated from freshly harvested seeds,
it is generally considered unimportant in the spread of the pathogen.

Crazy top is not a severe disease but it can cause significant losses
in low-lying areas of fields that are prone to flooding, since
infected plants are often barren. This disease is best managed by
improving field drainage or by avoiding low, wet areas in fields.
Rotation may be helpful if care is taken to keep rotational fields
free of grassy weeds. Pulling up and discarding infected plants can
reduce buildup of inoculum in the field, and thus reduce the risk of
disease in subsequent years.

[3] Grey leaf spot - Kansas

Some parts of Kansas have had recurring problems with gray leaf spot
in corn and this year [2009] is no exception, according to a Kansas
State University scientist.

"Recent surveying has indicated that it will be a very good year for
gray leaf spot in many of the areas where it has traditionally been a
problem," said K-State Research and Extension plant pathologist, Doug
Jardine. Scouting of fields should be done prior to any fungicide
applications. Many of the new hybrids have improved tolerance to gray
leaf spot and may not require a fungicide application.

"If you have lesions on the ear leaf at tasseling, you need to spray
regardless of the rated resistance," Jardine said. "Reduced rate
applications are strongly discouraged because of the possibility of
fungicide resistance development," he added.

[Eyespot of maize is caused by the fungus _Kabatiella zeae_, grey
leaf spot by _Cercospora zeae-maydis_, and crazy top by
_Sclerophthora macrospora_. An epidemic of grey leaf spot is feared
at this time to develop, especially in Nebraska (see links for
additional stories below). For more information on the fungal
pathogens and bacterial stalk rot see links below.
