Trichinosis outbreak alert in Cordoba
-------------------------------------
An outbreak of trichinosis cases was reported in the city of Cordoba.
This was confirmed by the Cordoba Ministry of Health, which reported
on the situation through its Epidemiology Unit and warned of the
dangers of consuming or buying pork of dubious origin or without the
corresponding health inspection.

So far, 7 cases of this disease have been reported in people from
Cordoba city, the Capital of the Department [State] who are being
treated in different hospitals of the city.

A report released by the Ministry of Health states that "according to
investigations, a common link between the cases was established in
that they all ate dry salami purchased in various commercial areas in
the Barrio Santa Isabela 1st Section, Pueyrredon, Zumaran, and the city center.

"The investigation and appropriate control measures are being
conducted jointly by professionals from the Epidemiology Unit of the
Ministry of Health, and the municipality of Cordoba through the
Directorate of Food Quality and reporting to Senasa [National Food
Safety and Quality Service] and the Ministry of Agriculture."

[Apparently the infection was transmitted by sausages and it is well
known that trichinella will survive in meat used in sausages whether
died, cured or smoked. Most probably, the meat was used for
consumption without the regulatory investigations for trichinella and
thus used illegally for human consumption. - Mod.EP]
