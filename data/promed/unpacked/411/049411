[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Zimbabwe can be accessed at http://healthmap.org/r/73a5. The location of the new outbreak in south east Zimbabwe can be seen on the map available at the source URL above.

According to the Zimbabwe page in the website of the World Reference Laboratory for FMD (WRLFMD), the FMDV serotypes SAT 1, SAT 2, and SAT 3 are endemic in the (wild) African buffalo (_Syncerus caffer_; picture at http://tinyurl.com/pddsdv5) population in Zimbabwe.

The serotype which was found as the causative agent in the most recent FMD outbreaks in domestic cattle in Zimbabwe was SAT 3; its genotyping results are available at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2011/WRLFMD-2011-00029%20SAT2%20Zimbabwe%202010.pdf.
