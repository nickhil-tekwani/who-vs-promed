Outbreak of trichinellosis in north-western Poland, June 2007
-----------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of trichinellosis is ongoing in Zachodniopomorskie
Voivodeship (West Pomerania), a province in northwestern Poland
bordering Germany, and has, to date [12 Jul 2007], affected 201 people.
The outbreak was 1st notified to the local public health department
in Kamien Pomorski on 9 Jun 2007. [At the time,] 4 patients were
hospitalised with clinical symptoms suggestive of infection with
_Trichinella_ larvae -- fever, joint pain, periorbital and facial
oedema, vomiting, stomachache, and headache. The 1st results of the
epidemiological investigation showed a link between illness and
consumption of raw pork meat and meat products that had been produced
in one meat processing plant and were sold in shops.
The highest number of suspected cases was reported during the 1st
week of the outbreak, between 11 and 17 Jun [2007] -- in total 122,
including 43 hospitalised patients. By 2 Jul [2007], the number had
increased to 201 people, 73 of whom were hospitalised.
The initial diagnoses were based on clinical symptoms. Serological
tests are now being conducted by the Department of Medical
Parasitology at the National Institute of Hygiene, Warsaw. To date,
[12 Jul 2007], 60 serum samples have been examined; of those, 28 were
IgG anti-_Trichinella_ positive and 5 had an equivocal (+/-) result.
Leftover pork is being examined for _Trichinella_ larvae by the
National Veterinary Research Institute, Pulawy.
A single producer who delivered meat products to shops in different
towns in [the province] could be identified as the source of the
outbreak. This meat processing plant was closed on 15 Jun [2007], and
all meat products produced there in May and June [2007] have been
recalled from shops and storehouses.
[West Pomerania's] Sanitary Inspection informed consumers from the
[provincial] territory about the necessity of returning or destroying
the suspect products. Announcements were posted in shops, in which
meat products from the implicated factory were sold. Moreover, the
information was announced in the local media.
A message was sent through the Early Warning and Response System
(EWRS) and the rapid alert system for food and feed (RASFF) in the
middle of June [2007], to inform other European Union countries about
the ongoing outbreak of trichinellosis in Poland. None of the meat
products from this plant have been exported to other countries.
During the investigation, local epidemiologists were informed of
linked cases in Ireland and Germany who had been visiting relatives in Poland.

[A single producer has been identified as the source of the outbreak,
but we do not know how the pigs became infected. It is still a puzzle
that the meat could pass the inspection and give rise to human
infections before the infected pigs were identified. - Mod.EP]
