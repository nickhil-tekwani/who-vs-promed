"We have seen 1050 cases of hepatitis E in the refugee camps. To date, 26 refugees have died in camps in Upper Nile. This is 10 more deaths since mid-September"

Stretched UNHCR faces difficulties containing hepatitis E outbreak
------------------------------------------------------------------
The UNHCR [United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees] on Friday [9 Nov 2012] warned that its capacity to contain an outbreak of hepatitis E among the refugee population in South Sudan was increasingly stretched at a time when funding for its emergency operation was depleted. "The risks will grow if, as currently anticipated, we see fresh inflows of refugees from South Kordofan and Blue Nile states in neighbouring Sudan," spokesman Adrian Edwards added. Due to insecurity and worsening humanitarian conditions in South Kordofan and Blue Nile states, UNHCR staff on the ground expect thousands of new refugees to cross in the next weeks as roads become passable after the rainy season. UNHCR and its partners, including South Sudan's national health authorities, are already fighting an outbreak of hepatitis E in Upper Nile and Unity states, 2 regions where the disease is endemic and where
175 000 Sudanese refugees have found shelter.

"We have seen 1050 cases of hepatitis E in the refugee camps," said Edwards. "To date, 26 refugees have died in camps in Upper Nile. This is 10 more deaths since mid-September," he added. Hepatitis E virus is contracted and spread through consuming contaminated food and water. It damages the liver. Potentially fatal, the risk of infection is high in densely populated settings such as refugee camps. This is further exacerbated in the rainy season due to flooding and poor sanitation. Women and small children are the most vulnerable. Early diagnosis is also crucial for the survival of patients. Edwards said UNHCR was working with the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, which has sent 6 staff to test water and blood samples and conduct house-to-house interviews on hygiene practices.

To counter the spread of the disease among the tens of thousands of Sudanese refugees in South Sudan, "We are promoting better hygiene practices through hundreds of trained community workers. In all camps this community outreach exercise includes active case finding," Edwards said. The refugee agency has also been working to improve the supply of clean water in the camps, as well as upgrade latrines and provide more washing stations and soap. These measures have helped to slow the spread of the disease. However, UNHCR is struggling to meet the minimum humanitarian standards such as the provision of 15 to 20 litres of safe drinking water per refugee per day or building enough latrines so that each unit is shared by no more than 20 refugees.

Edwards stressed that UNHCR's South Sudan operation is seriously underfunded. "UNHCR needs a minimum of USD 20 million until the end of the year to keep up basic life-saving activities. Of our revised appeal for USD 186 million, only 40 per cent has been received so far. International NGOs also need additional funding beyond that amount to ensure that all activities can be carried out as needed," he stressed.

[South Sudan, officially the Republic of South Sudan, previously known as Southern Sudan, is a landlocked state in east-central Africa. South Sudan is bordered by Ethiopia to the east, Kenya to the southeast, Uganda to the south, the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the southwest, the Central African Republic to the west, and Sudan to the north. South Sudan includes the vast swamp region known as the Sudd formed by the White Nile.

The modern states of South Sudan and Sudan were part of Egypt, later being governed as an Anglo-Egyptian protectorate until Sudanese independence was achieved in 1956. Following the First Sudanese Civil War, the Southern Sudan Autonomous Region was formed in 1972 and lasted until 1983. A 2nd Sudanese civil war soon developed and ended with the Comprehensive Peace Agreement of 2005. Later that year, southern autonomy was restored when an Autonomous Government of Southern Sudan was formed. South Sudan became an independent state on 9 July 2011, and it is now a United Nations member state and a member state of the African Union, A map of South Sudan can be accessed at: http://www.unhcr.org/pages/4e43cb466.html.

Hepatitis E is found worldwide and different genotypes of hepatitis E virus determine differences in epidemiology. Genotype 1 is usually seen in developing countries and causes community level outbreaks while genotype 3 is usually seen in developed countries and does not cause outbreaks. Globally, 70 000 deaths and 3.4 million cases of acute hepatitis E are attributable to infection with hepatitis E virus genotypes 1 and 2. The highest seroprevalence rates are observed in regions where low standards of sanitation increase the risk for transmission of the virus. In Egypt, half the population aged above 5 years is serologically positive for hepatitis E virus. [see: http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs280/en/index.html.]

Hepatitis E virus is transmitted mainly through the faecal-oral route due to faecal contamination of drinking water. Other transmission routes have been identified, which include foodborne transmission from ingestion of products derived from infected animals, and vertical transmission from a pregnant woman to her fetus. The risk factors for hepatitis E infection are related to poor sanitation in large areas of the world and shedding of hepatitis E virus in faeces. Currently there is no vaccine available for control of hepatitis E virus infection. Fortunately, hepatitis E virus infection is usually self-limiting. However, hospitalization is necessary for people with fulminant hepatitis, and desirable for infected pregnant women.

Lack of adequate sanitation for many of the inhabitants of South Sudan is responsible for the escalating outbreak. On 14 Sep 2012 ProMED-mail reported at least 400 cases and 16 deaths in 3 refugee camps in South Sudan. The death toll has now reached at least 26, and the case number at least 1050. - Mod.CP
