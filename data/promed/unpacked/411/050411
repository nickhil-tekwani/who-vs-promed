A total of 9 people were exposed to rabies by a cat and dog at the start of this week, reports South Carolina's Department of Health and Environmental Control [DHEC].

In Kershaw County, 3 separate people were exposed to rabies by a stray cat in Camden on [Mon 21 Jul 2014] and [Tue 22 Jul 2014]. The cat was captured and tested positive for rabies in lab tests Wednesday [23 Jul 2014].

In Greenwood County, one family dog exposed 6 different people to rabies on Monday [21 Jul 2014]. The dog had not been vaccinated against the disease, and likely was exposed to it through contact with a wild animal such as a fox, raccoon, bat, or skunk.

These cases bring the total number of 71 confirmed cases of rabies in animals so far this year [2014].

Pets that are exposed to the virus must be either euthanized, or quarantined for the fatal disease to run its course. Once rabies has infected the family pet, there is no cure. Above and beyond, the most important protection against this heartbreaking virus is through vaccination. DHEC sponsors rabies clinics across the state, in association with local veterinarians every spring, and low-cost vaccinations are available every day at local veterinary clinics.

In addition, Pawmetto Lifeline's "Care-A-Van" travels all over the Midlands every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, offering rabies vaccinations, along with other necessary vaccinations and services such as heart worm. For complete information on their services offered and schedule of locations, visit their website at http://careavansc.com.

If you are scratched or bitten by a potentially rabid animal, or get the animal's saliva in a pre-existing wound, immediately wash the area with plenty of soap and water, and then be sure to seek medical attention and report the incident to DHEC, at http://www.scdhec.gov/rabies.

[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=2640450,242. To find Kershaw and Greenwood counties, go to http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/south_carolina_90.jpg. Greenwood County is 3 counties west of Columbia and Kershaw is one county northeast of Columbia.

By definition strays are rarely vaccinated, and most domesticated dogs will have contact with wildlife, usually bats, raccoons, possums, and skunks coming into their backyards. A dog may survive contact with a rabid fox, but a coyote will kill it, rabid or not. If your cats and dogs are not up to date on their rabies shots, get them vaccinated ASAP. - Mod.MHJ]
