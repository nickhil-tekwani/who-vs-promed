A local news agency reported on Thu 22 Sep 2011 that 3 people
including 2 infants have died while 13 people have been hospitalized
in south Kashmir's Shopian district due to an outbreak of jaundice. It
said that 2 pregnant women hailing from Karwadah in the district were
suffering from jaundice and were shifted to the SMHS hospital [in
Srinagar] today [22 Sep 2011]. Both women delivered, but the infants
did not survive and passed away minutes after being born.

Doctors at the hospital told the news agency that the infants died due
to jaundice. The news agency said that [one of the women] also passed
away after delivering her baby.

The agency quoted its correspondent in Shopian saying that many
patients were shifted to local hospitals in the districts, while 13
people were shifted to SK Institute of Medical Sciences in Soura,
Srinagar. The condition of 2 of the patients, it said, was critical.
Meanwhile, the department of Health has established a camp in the
area, the agency said.

In total 22 patients have been identified in the area and [on the
basis of their] the condition some have been referred to Srinagar
hospital, chief medical officer Dr Nazir Ahmad said. He admitted that
the risk of pregnant woman catching the disease was higher. Regarding
the death of the mother, he said, "Even though we don't have exact
details about her, she was said to be suffering from hepatitis during
her pregnancy."

People in the area have expressed anger against the Public Health
Engineering Department [PHE] for failing to provide a clean water
supply. The water tank constructed by the PHE has not been cleaned
[for a long time] and is not well kept, they alleged. Experts say that
the outbreak is primarily due to [consumption of] contaminated water.

[Jaundice is caused by a build-up of bilirubin in the blood and
tissues of the body. Bilirubin is a waste product that is produced
when red blood cells break down. Jaundice can occur as a result of any
condition, problem, or underlying factor that disrupts the movement of
bilirubin from the blood to the liver and then out of the body.
Intra-hepatic jaundice occurs when damage to the liver disrupts the
liver's ability to process bilirubin. Causes of intra-hepatic jaundice
include: the viral hepatitis group of infections (hepatitis A,
hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and hepatitis E viruses), leptospirosis (a
bacterial infection that is spread by animals, particularly rodents
and is common in tropical areas), glandular fever (caused by the
Epstein-Barr virus), and over-exposure to substances such as alcohol,
paracetamol, phenolic compounds, etc, autoimmune disease, and certain
genetic conditions.

Perhaps hepatitis E virus infection is the most likely cause of the
outbreak in Shopian which is associated with an inadequately
maintained water supply. Such outbreaks have not been uncommon in
India in the past. Further information is awaited concerning the
investigation into the causation of this outbreak.

Shopian District is one of the districts of Jammu and Kashmir state,
India. Its headquarters are located at Shopian city. A map showing the
location of Shopian district can be accessed at
