Anthrax kills 1, downs 400 in Cagayan
-------------------------------------
One person died and at least 400 more were infected with anthrax
after eating double-dead [? MHJ] carabao meat in Cagayan province
last week, a provincial health officer said Tuesday [2 Mar 2010].

Dr. Danilo Alonzo, Cagayan provincial health chief, said the fatality
was the 1st case of anthrax they recorded in Lasam town. He said the
man died of a heart attack, which they suspect was aggravated by the
effects of the anthrax disease. "The 1st case was recorded in a
hospital in Lasam. He died [of a heart disease], but the doctor saw
blisters and the man had skin infections," Alonzo said, adding that
these are signs of an anthrax infection.

Earlier reports said more than 50 people were infected by the
bacteria, but Alonzo said there were actually 400 cases. He said the
50 patients were the ones who were able to seek medical help at the
Cagayan Valley Medical Center. He said majority of the cases were
treated in Lasam town, through the help of the provincial government.
Alonzo said majority of the 400 patients have already recovered, and
only 13 remain under observation at the Cagayan Valley Medical Center.

The provincial health officer said the provincial government is now
looking into the possible liability of the provincial office of the
Department of Agriculture (DA). He said that the man who sold the
double-dead carabao meat to the victims, is claiming that the local
DA in Lasam town gave him an approval to sell the infected meat.
Alonzo said that according to the man, he brought a sample of the
carabao meat to the local DA and was told that it was safe for human
consumption as long as it had been drained of blood.

"This is what we are confirming, the possible liability of the people
from the Department of Agriculture in Lasam. The man said he was
given a go signal that the meat can be eaten," the doctor said. He
said the carabao meat was sold to the victims on 19 Feb 2010. He
added that it took a week before the victims started feeling the
symptoms of the disease.

[In the previous report there were 150 people being treated and 2 had
died. This report appears to be a description of one of those deaths
and how anthrax was 1st diagnosed. In the context of this article I
suspect that"double-dead" is an animal that was found dead and in
this case butchered.

This dead man might have died of a heart attack but it should be
remembered that death from anthrax, whether of livestock or humans,
is extremely sudden. I well remember the director of the Sverdlovsk
hospital that was in the area of the town worst affected in the 1979
epidemic that she would be talking to walk-in patients, taking their
temperature and pulse, and they would die in mid sentence. It is acute shock.

The lethality in anthrax is a function of the exposure dose. As these
people took a "week" to develop symptoms it would seem that the doses
were on the low side.

The provincial Department of Agriculture clearly has a problem on its hands.
