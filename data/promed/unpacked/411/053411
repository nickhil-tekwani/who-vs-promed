Even as the carcass of a 20-year-old male elephant that died of anthrax at Neerodai near Hasanur in the Sathyamangalam forest has been safely disposed, the Animal Husbandry Department is vaccinating cattle in the 8-km radius as a precaution.

The elephant that had died 2 days ago [25 May 2015] was buried on Monday in a 15-foot-deep pit and the surface was burnt as a precaution to prevent spread of the disease to other animals. Alongside burning the surface of the spot of burial, a team also dug out the spot (a half-foot deep) where the elephant was found dead, and sprinkled a mixture of turmeric and calcium, Hasanur Range Officer S. Palanisamy said.

This is the 2nd incident of elephant death due to anthrax [recently]. Last December [2015], an adult elephant died due to anthrax in Bhavani Sagar range.

On Tue 26 May 2015, the Animal Husbandry Department started vaccinating cattle and livestock in villages within an 8km radius to prevent infection, as spores could spread through the air. [By biting flies. - Mod.MHJ] "We have advised cattle-rearers in villages in the surroundings through the Village Forest Committees not to graze their animals for at least a month in the surroundings of the sterilised area."

"Vaccinations will be conducted in the villages by joint teams of Forest and Animal Husbandry department employees over the next 3 days," District Forest Officer of Hasanur Division C.H. Padma said.

Tamil Nadu is in the far south of the country. Berhampur is in southern Odisha; see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmapur,_Odisha Odisha (once known as Orissa) is in the northeast and next to West Bengal.

Both states have severe anthrax problems. But it is a change to see the veterinary authorities in Tamil Nadu taking such a vigorous response to the threat from this dead elephant to protect the livestock in neighboring villages. - Mod MHJ]
