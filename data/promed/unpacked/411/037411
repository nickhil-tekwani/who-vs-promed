Irrigation water appears unlikely to have been the source of
infections in home-grown seed potatoes of the bacterial disease
caused by _Dickeya chrysanthemi_, tests suggest. But seed growers
should continue to take steps to avoid introducing the pathogen --
which can cause soft rots in progeny tubers -- into seed-growing
areas, John Elphinstone of the Central Science Laboratory told Farmers Weekly.

Research had revealed that the disease was caused by at least 6
different species of _Dickeya_ bacteria, but within Europe, only one
-- _D. dianthicola_ -- had been implicated in causing the disease in
potatoes, he said. 1st found in the UK on ware crops in 1990, _D.
chrysanthemi_ infections are mostly associated with crops that are
grown from seed brought in from outside the UK. But it had also been
found in 2 home-grown seed stocks, including one from Suffolk
identified in samples collected in 2007.

There had been some suggestions that the source of the infection
could have been irrigation water, because _Dickeya_ species have been
detected in watercourses. But the strains found in watercourses were
different, said Dr Elphinstone. "So it looks like it might not be
through water."

More research was being undertaken in a 3-year Scottish
government-funded project into the bacteria's biology to help
understand how the infection had moved into seed crops, with the aim
of designing a better control programme, he said. "At the moment, it
is difficult to recommend specific control measures for
_chrysanthemi_," he added.

Following guidelines for controlling soft rots and blackleg would be
a good starting point for seed growers to help prevent its
introduction, he suggested, particularly in Scotland, where the
disease had never been found. "Being a member of the Safe Haven
scheme would also provide a barrier to introducing the disease on
seed [tubers] from outside the UK," Dr Elphinstone added.

[Bacterial soft rot of potato can be caused by _Pectobacterium
carotovorum_ subsp. _carotovorum_ (previously _Erwinia c._ subsp.
_c._) or _Dickeya chrysanthemi_ (previously _Erwinia chrysanthemi_).
Soft rot is favoured by warm and humid conditions. Symptoms include
brown spots on the tuber surface which will turn into a cream
coloured rot that rapidly destroys the tuber. Soft rot may be
confined to lenticels (surface pores of tubers). Infected lenticels
appear slightly sunken, tan to brown and water-soaked. Under dry
conditions, lenticel infections may dry up leaving a small pit, but
harvesting potatoes under wet conditions will increase the risk of
soft rot expanding in storage.

The bacteria are spread with contaminated plant or other material, by
mechanical means and water. Fungal pathogens may increase the risk of
secondary soft rot, or additional pathogens may invade soft rot
affected tubers through skin lesions. Disease management includes
seed tuber handling and cultural techniques, use of clean planting
material, and phytosanitation to prevent introduction of the
pathogens from external sources.

_D. chrysanthemi_ can also affect other crops and causes, for
example, a foot rot disease in rice. The pathogen has been included
on the quarantine list of the European Plant Protection Organisation
(EPPO). Blackleg disease of potato is caused by the related
_Pectobacterium carotovorum_ subsp. _atrosepticum_ (previously
_Erwinia c._ subsp. _a._).
