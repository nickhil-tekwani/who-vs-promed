Bangladesh: Dengue Fever Continues to Spread
--------------------------------------------
A dwindling supply of blood is exacerbating the dengue outbreak in
Bangladesh. The total number of dengue-affected patients, according to
the official accounts, stood at 4763 as of 16 Sep 2002. Of these, 45
have died so far. The Dengue Control Room sources said 509 persons
affected with dengue virus were undergoing treatment at different
hospitals across the country.
Meanwhile, it was reported that one person died from dengue
hemorrhagic fever (DHF) in Magura district, while 4 others had been
hospitalised in Jessore General Hospital in the last 24 hours. The
Khulna City Corporation in the meantime has launched an anti-
mosquito drive in the city. At least one person died in Chapai-
Nawabganj district and 15 others have been hospitalised for DHF. All
of them were admitted to the Rajshahi Medical College Hospital
(RMCH) during the past 10 days. The RMCH authorities have
opened a 'dengue corner' to facilitate treatment of dengue patients. Of
the 15 affected, only 5 are now undergoing treatment at the 'dengue
corner' of the RMCH while the rest have been shifted to Dhaka. In
addition, 10 more persons were being treated at different clinics in
Rajshahi city.
The government has [been unable to contain] the dengue [fever
outbreak, which is] spreading fast day by day across the country.
Competent sources said Dhaka City Corporation (DCC), this year,
failed to [distribute] larvicide and adulticide to kill the _Aedes_
mosquito, the carrier of dengue virus. As a result, the unabated
breeding of _Aedes_ mosquitoes has [contributed to the spread of the
disease]. When asked why the Dhaka City Corporation (DCC)
had failed to [distribute larvicide and adulticide this year], the source
stated that it was because the DCC [had not paid] Rhone Poulenc India
for materials supplied previously. The DCC [has] asked all its 10 zones
to purchase Malathion, an effective mosquito killer that has also been
recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO). "This
insecticide is cheap. One liter costs about 35 Takas against 355 Takas a
litre [USD 0.62 vs 6.34] for quick-acting fogging fluid. [Furthermore,
malathion] is locally available. The latest DCC larval survey revealed
that the _Aedes_ egg concentration in Dhaka is highest in (1) roof-top
uncovered water tanks, followed by (2) open cemented water tanks in
under-construction buildings, and (3) tires found in open spaces.

Endemic%20in%20Hong%20Kong&catOID=45C9C78B-88AD-11D4-

Hong Kong health officials say Dengue Fever may become a permanent
threat to the population after they confirmed 17 cases of the mosquito-
borne disease were contracted in the territory. Government officials are
launching intensive measures to prevent a major outbreak of the virus.
The Hong Kong Department of Health says now that it has confirmed
that Dengue Fever cases have been contracted locally, they are
concerned that the virus will be endemic in the territory. 17 people
have fallen ill after being bitten by mosquitos here. The latest victim is
a 61-year-old man living the neighborhood of Sham Shui Po, a highly
urbanized section of Kowloon Peninsula [maimland China]. All local
cases have been diagnosed either in Kowloon or in some of the
territory's outlying islands.
The patients are apparently suffering from the milder strain of the
hemorrhagic fever. It is not fatal, but still characterized by body
temperatures as high as 40 degrees as well as headaches and severe
joint and muscle pain.
This is the first time that Dengue Fever has been contracted in Hong
Kong. Last year, the nearby Chinese territory of Macau saw its first
Dengue Fever outbreak. The Hong Kong government responded by
launching a major mosquito eradication campaign. The government is
now stepping up those efforts, intensifying fumigation to reduce the
mosquito population before next year's rainy season. They also hope
that the onset of cooler weather this month will help prevent a major
outbreak.
However, the Health Department warns there is every chance that
sporadic cases of Dengue will continue to occur in Hong Kong as the
virus is endemic in Southeast Asia. Fatalities occur in only a small
percentage of those who get infected. The most vulnerable are young
children.

[According to an AFP report in Portuguese, the dengue virus isolated
from the 61-year-old man was type 2, reportedly the first time this
strain has been isolated there, indicating that previous imported cases
had other types. - Mod.JW]
