South Asia: Earthquake Appeal No. 05EA022 Operations Update No. 5
--------------------------------------------------
Quake survivors continue to struggle with shortage of medical care,
shelter and safe water. Makeshift tent cities have reportedly sprung
up in Muzaffarabad. People burn whatever they can find to keep warm
and prepare food. Initial findings suggest that food aid appears to
be sufficient; however, the Red Cross and Red Crescent have been
alerted that food may become an issue in a few months. Limited access
and bad weather conditions are, however, limiting relief efforts to
concentrate in urban areas. Heavy rains have resulted in flooding of
tents and temporary shelters.
The UN and the Pakistani authorities estimate that only 2 percent of
the water and sanitation needs are met. There are already reporting
cases of bloody diarrhea and dysentery. Health needs are increasingly
becoming a main area of concern.

About 156 cases of cholera have so far been reported at the Komfo
Anokye Teaching Hospital in Kumasi. Officials have reported deaths in
as a result of delay in seeking medical attention.
Speaking on Kessben Fm's early morning show Maakye today, 17 Oct
2005, the Metro Director of Health Services, Dr. Joseph Oduro, blamed
the epidemic on food prepared and sold under unhygienic conditions
and the drinking of polluted water. Dr. Oduro cautioned the General
Public to be selective in patronizing food items and water.

The Greater Accra Regional Directorate of the Ghana Health Service on
Fri, 14 Oct 2005, warned the public about reported cases of cholera
in parts of the region and asked them to report cases of frequent
loose or watery stools and vomiting to the nearest clinic or hospital.
A statement signed by Dr Edward Antwi, Senior Medical Officer,
advised the public to maintain personal and environmental hygiene by
washing of hands with soap and water before eating and after visiting
the toilet.
It said vegetables and fruits should be washed properly and with
clean water and there should be proper disposal of liquid and solid waste.
The GHS advised the public to avoid buying or eating cold and
uncovered food, while food should be eaten warm.

40 cases of cholera had been reported at the Koforidua Regional
Hospital from Mon, 17 Oct 2005 to Thu, 20 Oct 2005. 36 of the sick
persons were students of the New Juaben College of Commerce
(NJUACOCO) from where the 1st case was reported, while the remaining
4 were from the adjoining communities.
Dr Kojo Tinkorang, the Deputy Eastern Regional Director of Health
Services, told the GNA in an interview on Fri, 21 Oct 2005 that as of
that morning, only 2 of the affected people were still on admission
while the rest had been treated and discharged.
Dr Tinkorang said the 1st case was reported by a new student of the
NJUACOCO who visited Accra on Mon afternoon, 17 Oct 2005, and by the
next morning, 32 cases were reported from the school.
On Wed, 19 Oct 2005, 4 cases were reported from the nearby
communities. Dr Tinkorang said the heath authorities moved into the
school, inspected food and sanitary facilities at the school,
organized health talks and gave the students and teachers prophylaxis
treatment as a preventive measure.
He said as at Fri morning, 21 Oct 2005, no new case had been reported
at the school and the [affected] communities, but the health
authorities have started using public address systems and the FM
radio stations to educate the public on personal hygiene and
environmental sanitation.
Dr Tinkorang said he led a team of health workers to inspect the
sanitary sites in the New Juaben Municipality to ensure that the
disease did not spill over to other parts of the municipality.
He described what he saw at all the sanitary sites as "very bad and a
danger to the community" and mentioned the communities the team
visited as Betom, Zongo, Asokore-Kuma, Srodae and Effiduase. Dr
Tinkorang called on the New Juaben Municipal Assembly to work hard to
help improve upon the conditions at the sanitary sites. He said
though no new cases had been reported, his outfit was maintaining a
surveillance system because the incubation period of the cholera
bacterium was 3 days.

[Koforidua, the capital of the Eastern Region, is only 59 km (37
miles) from Ghana, to the north and slightly east. The incubation
period of cholera is fairly short, usually 1-5 days (average
2-3). To have a student visit Accra on an afternoon with 32 cases
developing by the following morning, however, suggests that the
student is not likely to be the source. Additionally, the infection
does not generally spread from person to person, as the infectious
dose to infect 50 percent of people is high -- but rather through
contaminated water or food in which the organism can replicate. - Mod.LL]

3 persons have been confirmed dead and many others are presently
responding to treatment following an outbreak of cholera in Hawe
village of Billiri in Gombe State. Also in Katsina State, another 4
are reported dead also as a result of the same epidemic.
Confirming the outbreak of the disease, Billiri healthcare
co-ordinator Idris Maiyamba disclosed that over 30 people are
affected and are currently on admission at the Billiri general hospital.
Maiyamba said the council has procured enough drugs for the health
department to fight the outbreak and to bring the situation under control.
Saturday Sun also learnt that all the victims of the epidemic in
Katsina were residents of Urma village where about 8 other people had
been rushed to Kurfi general hospital. Investigations revealed that
the epidemic was also recorded at Koza, Saudawa, Madaka and Kadage

[6] Cholera - Belgium ex Turkey
Date: Wed, 13 Oct 2005
From: Per-Arne Parment <Per-Arne.Parment@sblvaccines.se>

2 confirmed and 4 probable cases of cholera have been reported in
Belgian tourists returning from travel to Turkey. On 22 Sep 2005, the
Gezondheidsinspectie (Health Inspectorate) in Antwerp was notified of
the isolation of _Vibrio cholerae_ in a stool sample from a
62-year-old woman. She was admitted to hospital in Antwerp on 17 Sep
2005 immediately after returning from a trip to Turkey, with watery
diarrhea, dehydration and renal failure. The clinical picture was
initially unclear because she had undergone stomach surgery to treat
cancer not long before the tour. The patient was admitted to hospital
for 4 days and was treated with quinolones. Further testing confirmed
infection with _V. cholerae__O1 biotype El Tor, serotype Inaba.
After notification of this case, an investigation was begun to
collect epidemiological information, ascertain any other potential
cases, identify the source and coordinate control measures. All tour
group members were interviewed about potential exposures during the trip.
A 2nd female patient had contracted severe gastrointestinal symptoms
on 18 Sep 2005. She was treated as an outpatient. A stool culture was
also positive for _V. cholerae_ O1. She was treated with quinolones
and recovered. 4 other patients contracted severe gastroenteritis
shortly after their return. They were seen by their general
practitioners and were treated with symptomatic therapy. Stool
cultures were performed after these patients had recovered and did
not grow _V. cholerae_. All patients recovered after 4 days. No
secondary cases were detected. The attack rate for the tour group was
6/8 (75 percent).
The tour group had traveled around west Turkey on a 14-day package
tour. Group members were aged between 58 and 68 years. They used a
private bus, and at the end of their trip, they took an internal
flight from Ankara to Istanbul.
During the journey they stayed at different hotels and visited
Istanbul, Bursa, Efeze, Affrodisias, Pamukkale, Kusadasi, Antalya,
Cappadocia, Ilhara and Ankara. They ate in several small restaurants
and also ate food bought at markets and shops. During the internal
flight, a salad was served.
Control measures
----------------
All tour group members were informed of the risks, and advised to
contact their general practitioner and provide a stool sample.
General practitioners were advised about treatment and follow-up.
Patients were advised to limit their contacts and to apply hygienic
measures to prevent further transmission. Patients were not
automatically admitted to hospital nor systematically treated with
antibiotics. The WHO, the Turkish health authorities and the European
Early Warning and Response System (EWRS) were informed immediately
after detection of the cases.
Discussion
----------
Cholera is an acute bacterial enteric disease caused by an infection
with _V. cholerae_, serogroup O1 or O139. _V. cholerae_ includes 2
biotypes -- the classical type and El Tor type. Each biotype has 3
serotypes (Inaba, Ogawa, and rarely Hikojima). Cholera may be present
in an asymptomatic state, as a mild disease or as the typical
syndrome characterized by a sudden onset and profuse, painless,
watery diarrhea. The incubation period varies from a few hours to 5
days and patients are infectious while they have diarrhea and up to 7
days after (1, 2).
Databases of cholera cases reported to the WHO last recorded cholera
cases in Turkey in 1977, and no data was supplied from 1978-1992. To
date, there have been no other recent cases of cholera reported from
Turkey (3).
Only the 2 patients confirmed to have cholera were treated with
antibiotics. The other patients received symptomatic treatment and
recovered quickly. The patients had only a few contacts, and were not
working on or participating in activities which could have
facilitated secondary transmission.
The attack rate was rather high (75 percent). A 7th patient developed
minimal diarrhea 5 days after return from Turkey but was not
considered as a probable case. The high attack rate probably
represents a high infective dose and there could potentially be other
cases in Turkish residents or in visiting tourists. There are
unofficial reports of cholera outbreaks in countries in the region
surrounding Turkey, such as Iran, Tajikistan and Afghanistan (4, 5, 6).

[7] Cholera, non-O1, non-O139 - Slovenia ex Tunisia
Date: Thu, 20 Oct 2005
From: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>
From: Eurosurveillance [edited]
<http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2005/051020.asp#6>

The 1st case of _Vibrio cholerae_ infection to be reported in
Slovenia since 1977 was detected in Jul 2005. We report an imported
case of _Vibrio cholerae_ non-O1, non-O139 infection from Tunisia to Slovenia.
A 20-year-old Slovene man worked in a hotel on Djerba Island,
Tunisia, from May to Jun 2005. He visited the Tunisian mainland, but
did not travel out of the country. In mid-June 2005 he presented with
vomiting, diarrhea and fever. The hotel physician prescribed a 5-day
course of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. At first, his symptoms
improved with treatment, but after a couple of days they worsened,
and he was advised to return to Slovenia.
On 1 Jul 2005, he was admitted to a regional hospital in Slovenia
with chills, a fever of 39 degrees C and mild diarrhea. Blood and
stool cultures were taken and he was given treatment for suspected
septicaemia. Multiple liver and spleen abscesses were found.
Oxidase-positive, slightly curved bacilli were isolated in blood
cultures at the regional public health institute. The strain was
further identified as non-O1, non-O139 _V. cholerae_ at both the
regional and national public health institutes in Slovenia.
Identification was confirmed at the Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens,
Health Protection Agency Centre for Infections, England. The strain
was susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin,
tetracycline and ciprofloxacin. The stool culture remained negative.
The patient was treated with ampicillin, doxycycline and
ciprofloxacin, and since recovery he has remained in good health.
The patient reported having completed a course of treatment with
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prescribed in Tunisia, and it is not
clear why he did not recover at that time. One hypothesis is that the
focus of infection was in the patient's liver, biliary tract or
spleen, the pathogen was not completely eliminated, and bacteria
multiplied after the end of therapy and caused his relapse.
Epidemiological investigation revealed no illness with diarrhea in
the patient's family or other close contacts. After confirmation of
the strain identification, the national public health institute
informed other European Union member states of the case via the Early
Warning and Response System.
This imported case of _V. cholerae_ non-O1, non-O139 infection is
unusual. _V. cholerae_ non-O1, non-O139 serotypes are rare, and do
not cause the disease known as cholera, but infections can be fatal
[2]. This case is very similar to a case imported from Tunisia to
Austria in 1997 [3], and is an important reminder to physicians and
microbiologists of the possibility of such events.

[Human infections with this organism generally present with
gastroenteritis. Indeed, bacteremic illnesses due to non-O1,
non-O139 _V. cholerae_ are unusual, and it is possible that some of
the earlier reports were due to non-cholera vibrios such _V.

77 schoolchildren in the Chuvashia village of Vurnary proved to have
intestinal infection, and 56 of them are now in a hospital, the
Chuvashia Health and Social Development Ministry said on Sun, 16 Oct 2005.
According to the preliminary information, 48 children aging from 7
through 17 [years of age] have dysentery. Doctors say that their
condition is not critical. The school is under sanitary treatment.
One of the theories is that the children were poisoned with
[contaminated] sausage, so the school canteen is temporary closed.
