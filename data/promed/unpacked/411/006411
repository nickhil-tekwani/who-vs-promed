At least 3 people, and a dog exposed to fox with rabies in Zebulon, Maryland
-----------------------------------------------------------
A fox carrying rabies was killed in Zebulon after acting strangely during a direct encounter with several people and a dog.

Animal Control responded at Wakelon Park on Pippin Road and the fox was taken to the state lab in Raleigh for testing.

Three people who were exposed have begun a series of treatments for rabies exposure. The process will require 4 treatments over the next 14 days. [This is post exposure prophylaxis. It is NOT given in the stomach but is an intramuscular injection. - Mod.TG]

The dog that encountered the fox was vaccinated for rabies and required a booster vaccine. State law requires potentially rabid pets to be destroyed unless owners agree to support a 6-month quarantine.

"We don't want to alarm residents in Zebulon, but they should be aware of these cases, and of the potential for exposure to themselves, family members and their pets," said Sue Lynn Ledford, community health director for Wake County. "Rabies vaccination is critical to help to prevent the spread of disease, and rabies vaccination is required by law. This is a great opportunity to remind everyone of the importance of rabies vaccinations for their pets."

The last reported case of rabies in Wake County was in November 2011 in Raleigh, according to Wake County Animal Control.

Rabid cat found in Cecil County; 5 scratched by animal in Port Deposit
----------------------------------
Cecil County [Maryland] health officials say rabies has been found in a sickly stray cat that scratched 5 people in downtown Port Deposit. The 5 people were scratched Friday. The cat was captured and euthanized at a veterinarian's office and tested.

The 5 people have been urged to seek treatment.

The cat is described as a small- to medium-sized yellow tabby. Anyone exposed to the animal in the past 10 days should go to an emergency room. Officials say this is the first domestic animal that has tested positive in Cecil County this year. The previous cases were in 4 raccoons and a skunk.

The Pennsylvania Department of Health says a rabid fox was found in Wayne (Delaware County), Pa. yesterday, and now they are looking for someone who may have had potentially dangerous contact with the animal.

Radnor Township police responded to the 400 block of East Lancaster Avenue on Monday afternoon, after a call came in about an injured fox.

When they arrived on the scene, an unidentified white man was holding the animal in a blanket, according to Christine Cronkright with the Pennsylvania health department.

"Unfortunately, the man left the scene without giving any identifying information to the police," she said today. "Now, since that time, the animal was acting a little bit strangely so the Pennsylvania Department of Health, Bureau of Laboratories actually tested the animal and we received results that the animal did in fact have rabies."

Cronkright says the man and anyone else who may have had any contact with the red fox should get checked out by a doctor and contact the department of health at 877-PA-HEALTH (8am-5pm) right away.

Indiana University student bitten by rabid bat in dorm room
---------------------------------------------
An Indiana University student bitten by a rabid bat while he slept in his Bloomington dorm room is receiving rabies shots.

The Herald-Times reports his roommate and a pest control worker who transported the bat also are receiving the 14-day regimen of shots.

IU spokesman Mark Land says the student was bitten on a hand and shook the bat off in a hallway. The bat was later found alive in the hallway by a residence hall employee who called the pest control worker, who collected the bat and sent it to the Indiana State Department of Health for testing.

Health department spokesman Ken Severson says 2 other bats also tested positive for rabies last week. They were in the Fort Wayne area. Rabies can be fatal if untreated.

[Each one of these snippets should serve as a reminder to us that this fatal disease is still very active and requires our vigilance. Protection of us and our pets is important and one of the best ways to build that protective barrier is to have your pets, large and small, vaccinated against rabies.

Dogs, cats, ferrets, horses, show animals such as calves, sheep, and goats should be vaccinated against rabies.
