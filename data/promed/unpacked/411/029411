Test results from fish sampling suggest the recent Spofford Lake fish
kill resulted from the presence of a common aquatic bacteria combined
with a time of year when fish in the lake were stressed from spawning
activity and warm water temperatures. Fish kills occur naturally in
New Hampshire water bodies from time to time, according to New
Hampshire Fish and Game Department biologists, although they typically
involve fewer fish.

The situation began on 16 Jun 2011, when lakeshore residents of
Spofford Lake in Chesterfield noticed unusually large numbers of dead
fish floating up on their properties and reported the occurrence to NH
Fish and Game's Region 4 Office in Keene. Residents mainly had
observed dead sunfish (bluegill and pumpkinseed), along with smaller
numbers of bullhead, northern pike and yellow perch. Fisheries staff
visited the lake on 20 Jun 2011 and made similar observations in terms
of the mix of species among the dead fish. One bullhead and 8 dead
sunfish were collected and sent to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
(USFWS) Fish Health Center in Lamar, PA for testing. During the
following 2 weeks, NH Fish and Game fisheries staff continued to visit
Spofford Lake every few days to make further observations on the
number and species of dead fish.

"The real peak of the fish kill appeared to be during the week of 20
Jun 2011," said Fisheries Biologist Gabe Gries. "From the end of that
week to the present, the numbers of dead fish showing up have steadily
declined. We visited the lake again on 6 Jul 2011 and only saw a
handful of dead sunfish."

Test results from the USFWS Fish Health Center were received on 7 Jul
2011 and showed that no virus was present in the fish tested and that
the most dominant bacteria found on the test cultures was _Aeromonas
hydrophila_, a common aquatic bacteria. According to Fish Health
Center staff, this bacteria only becomes lethal to fish when there is
another stressor to the fish. For example, fish that have just
finished spawning or that are subjected to rapid increases in water
temperature could become stressed to the point where _Aeromonas
hydrophila_ could become lethal to the fish. In some cases, the
bacteria can infect a single fish and then multiply rapidly, causing a
substantial fish kill.

"Given that the vast majority of dead fish were sunfish, it is likely
that sunfish, already stressed from spawning, experienced some warm
water conditions that led to the outbreak of the bacteria," said
Gries. "Given the low numbers of other fish species found dead, it is
difficult to determine if the other fish species died from the
bacteria or if they simply were fish that died from natural causes."

The test results did not raise concerns about eating fish from
Spofford Lake. "There is no indication that the bacteria is
communicable to humans, but it is, of course, always a good idea to
thoroughly cook any fish you wish to eat," said Dr. Richard French of
the NH Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory in Durham, NH

NH Fish and Game biologists will continue to monitor the situation at
Spofford Lake. They collected live sunfish and bullhead on 6 Jul 2011
for further testing by the NH Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory.

It seems that many of the dead fish must have been picked up, as
there has been no report of botulism outbreaks in birds. - Mod.TG]
