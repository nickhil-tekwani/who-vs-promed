[Mumbai] has reported 2 cases of [visceral leishmaniasis, kala azar]
in less than a month and the civic authorities are unprepared to deal
with its outbreak.
Sources in BMC [Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai, formerly
Bombay Municipal Corporation] indicated that the medicines for the
treatment of the patients had to be procured from outside. "There is
a limited stock of sodium stibogluconate in the civic hospitals that
is used to treat kala azar [visceral leishmaniasis], which has
worsened the situation. We have sought the help of medical experts in
this issue and soon we will find some solution to giving treatment to
everyone," sources said.
Both patients [were admitted in serious condition to] the J.J
Hospital in Nagpada and R.N Cooper hospital in Vile Parle.
When asked, deans of some civic hospitals in the city [appeared]
prepared for fighting the disease, in case of an outbreak. "It is
transmitted by the bite of a fly and enters into the body and then it
lodges in the liver, spleen, and skin. The skin becomes black in
colour, [hence the name] kala azar. The drugs that can be used for
this disease are amphotericin, which is available easily, and
liposomal-amphotericin, which is a little expensive but safe and it
is available in our hospital," said Dr. Neelima Kshrisagar, dean of
KEM Hospital in Parel.
According to Dr. M E Yealekar, dean of Sion Hospital, "Illness of
chronic nature, abdominal mass (swelling of stomach), slate colour of
one's hue, and the immunity becomes low: these are the symptoms of
kala azar. The insects that spread this disease are mainly found in
northern parts of India like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. So only people
who have been to that place or are residents can only this disease."
He also added that proper treatment must be given on time, otherwise
[the disease] might be fatal.
However, Dr. Neelima Kshrisagar of KEM Hospital said, "This disease
is not contagious. Moreover, I do not think it would affect Mumbai
anyways. There are only one or 2 cases in Mumbai every year. This
insect basically breeds in an area with high temperature and dry hot
atmosphere. But still to be on the safer side we should keep our
surroundings hygienic and ensure cleanliness to avoid any such thing
to happen in the near future."
This disease can be controlled by early detection, house-to-house
survey, to control sand fly by DDT or insecticide. When asked about
the further steps taken by the BMC for kala azar, Dr. Jayaraj
Thanekar, Executive Health Officer of BMC bluntly replied "Nothing,
people are just panicking. There is no need to worry. This is mainly
found in northern part of India and it won't affect Mumbai."
Kala azar is a chronic and potentially fatal parasitic disease of the
viscera (the internal organs, particularly the liver, spleen, bone
marrow and lymph nodes) due to infection by the parasite called
_Leishmania donovani_. _Leishmania donovani_ is transmitted by
sandfly bites in parts of Asia (primarily India), Africa (primarily
Sudan), and South America (primarily Brazil), where all together
there are an estimated half million cases per year. There are also
several hundred cases yearly in Europe (primarily in the
Mediterranean region) and a few in North America.
Sources in the BMC's health Department said that kala azar can cause
no or few symptoms "but typically it is associated with fever, loss
of appetite (anorexia nervosa), fatigue, bleeding tendency from nose,
enlargement of the liver, spleen and nodes, and suppression of the
bone marrow. The term 'kala azar' comes from our country, which means
black fever in Hindi. The disease is also known as Indian
leishmaniasis, visceral leishmaniasis, leishmania infection, dumdum
fever, black sickness, and black fever," sources said.
Dr. H.H Jadhav, Superintendent of G.T Hospital said, "Kala azar also
increases the risk of other secondary infections. The 1st oral drug
found to be effective for treating kala-azar is miltefosine. However,
when asked if there is any chance of the flies coming to the city, he
said, "No, the flies cannot come to city. However, such flies are
also found in lower-social economic strata like Colaba locality."
The name _Leishmania donovani_ honors 2 men: the British pathologist
William Boog Leishman who in 1903 wrote about the protozoa that
causes kala azar, and the researcher C. Donovan, who made the same
discovery independently the same year.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett
[Visceral leishmaniasis (kala azar), VL, is largely found in the
eastern part of India mainly in Bihar state and to some extent in its
bordering states like West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh. The main vector
in India is _Phlebotomus argentipes_. VL decreased in India during
the 1950's after extensive spraying with DDT as part of the malaria
control programme, but has been increasing again since the 1960's. A
large epidemic occurred in Bihar state in the 1990's. VL is typical
in rural areas and it is not known whether the 2 cases in this report
have been residents in endemic areas primarily Bihar state or have
been long-term residents in Mumbai. The prediction in this report,
that an epidemic is imminent in Mumbai therefore seems unfounded, and
more information on the 2 patients is needed. - Mod.EP
