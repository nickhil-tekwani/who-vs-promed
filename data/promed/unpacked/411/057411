The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced today [Fri 18 Aug 2017] 3 variant influenza cases among fairgoers in North Dakota, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. Information about the cases appears in this week's FluView report.

The cases bring the number of novel flu infections reported this year [2017] to 19, all but 1 reported in the last 30 days.

The CDC said all 3 patients had contact with swine at agricultural fairs. At this time, 2 of the viruses have been fully characterized and are influenza A H3N2 variant (H3N2v) viruses. The 3rd virus has been characterized as an influenza A (H3) variant, and tests are under way to further characterize it. A variant influenza strain occurs when an influenza A virus that normally circulates in swine is detected in humans.

A total of 4 states now report cases Texas, Ohio, North Dakota, and Pennsylvania are the only states to report variant strains this year [2017], with Ohio reporting 15 H3 variant viruses and one H1N2 variant virus (the other states have reported one H3N2v case each).

Of the 3 cases announced today[Fri 18 Aug 2017], 2 people attended the same fair. The Pennsylvania resident's exposure occurred out of state, according to FluView. The North Dakota Department of Health released a statement on [Tue 15 Aug 2017] that said 2 people, one an out-of-state visitor, contracted the variant virus at the North Dakota State Fair in Minot.

Two of the 3 patients were hospitalized, and all 3 have fully recovered from their infections. One patient was older than 64; the other 2 were children.

H3N2v was 1st detected in humans in 2011. In 2012, the CDC confirmed 309 United States cases, most linked to exposure at swine exhibits. Last year [2016], 18 cases were reported.

[The total number of Influenza A/H3N2v cases reported in 2017 reported during 2017 is 18 to date [Fri 18 Aug 2017] (according to the latest update on CDC webpage https://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/h3n2v-case-count.htm] with 2 hospitalizations.

Clinical characteristics of the A/H3N2v cases are generally consistent with those of seasonal influenza including fever, cough, pharyngitis, myalgia, and headache.

Rapid detection and characterization of novel influenza viruses are important components of national efforts in the United States to prevent further cases and evaluate clinical illness associated with these viruses. As a result, clinicians are reminded to consider influenza as a possible diagnosis when evaluating patients with acute respiratory illnesses, and clinicians should consider the possibility of H3N2v in persons presenting with respiratory illness and recent swine contact or attendance at an agricultural fair (https://emergency.cdc.gov/HAN/han00351.asp). - Mod.UBA
