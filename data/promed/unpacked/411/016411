Death Due to Hantavirus Infection Confirmed in Region X
-------------------------------------------------------
The Llanquihue-Chiloe-Palena Health Service confirmed that a 4
year-old girl from Llico Bajo, a rural town near the community of
Fresia, in the Tenth Region, died of hantavirus infection.
According to the patientÂ’s history, provided by the Health Service,
the girl was admitted to the local hospital on 18 Sep 2001 with a
severe fever that eventually resulted in her death.
Radio Chile reported that on Thursday a team from the Department of
Environmental Programs would travel to the area where the patient
lived, in order to collect diagnostic samples and determine the
possible zone where the infection occurred.
