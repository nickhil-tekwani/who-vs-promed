An unknown disease has killed several fighting cocks in Barangay Rosary Heights 1 [Cotabato City] in the past few days.

Among those killed by the disease were 5 cocks at Mangga Boys game farm. The animals all died inside their cages and showed symptoms like swollen head, blindness and severe flu.

[RC], one of the gamefowl owners, said the chickens had colds and fever, and became weak.

"We noticed that the unknown disease has led to death of fighting cocks starting last week. We attempted to treat with antibiotics and other medicines, but it didn't work," a caretaker in one game farm said.

Owners burned the dead chickens before burying them, a measure which they hoped would stop the unknown disease from spreading. But city veterinarian Dr. Robert Malcontento said cases of avian diseases should be reported to his office. He said laboratory tests are needed to know the diseases that killed the animals.

[As indicated by the city veterinarian, for the diagnosis of the disease, laboratory investigations are required. In view of the described swelled heads, one of the diseases to be addressed is infectious coryza (IC), an acute respiratory disease of chickens characterized by nasal discharge, sneezing, and swelling of the face under the eyes. The disease, caused by the bacterium _Avibacterium paragallinarum_, is found worldwide. In the Philippines, IC has been considered as one of the top 5 to 10 diseases among chickens, particularly layers, breeders and fighting cocks (http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=PH2003001051).

According to the Merck Veterinary Manual, because early treatment of IC is important, water medication is recommended immediately until medicated feed is available. Erythromycin and oxytetracycline are usually beneficial. Several new-generation antibiotics (e.g., fluoroquinolones, macrolides) are active against IC. Various sulfonamides, sulfonamide-trimethoprim, and other combinations have been successful. Prevention is the only sound method of control. Bacterins are available to help prevent and control the disease. Because serovars A, B, and C are not cross-protective, it is essential that bacterins contain the serovars present in the target population. For the Merck article addressing all aspects of IC, please refer to https://www.msdvetmanual.com/poultry/infectious-coryza/overview-of-infectious-coryza-in-chickens.

IC is generally not regarded as highly fatal; other disease agents, including viral, should be excluded. - Mod.AS
