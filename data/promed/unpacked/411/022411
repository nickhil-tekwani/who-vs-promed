Chikungunya Epidemic Situation as of 7 Sep 2005
---------------------------------------------------
International Situation
An epidemic (of Chikungunya) has been reported on the Comoros islands since
January 2005. At this time, more than 5000 cases have been noted. More than
3600 cases were also reported on Mauritius between the end of April until
the end of June.
Reunion Island
-----
Because of geographic proximity, and more importantly because of the
movement of people between the Republic of Comoros, Mayotte island and
Reunion island, it was foreseen by the end of March 2005 that the
importation of cases would occur and there would be extension of the
epidemic to French territories in the Indian Ocean. A specific surveillance
system, distribution of professional health information, and an increased
anti-vector campaign were put into effect by the beginning of April.
Between 28 Mar and 22 Aug 2005, 3181 cases of Chikungunya had been
identified on Reunion, of which 883 were serologically confirmed. The
number of new cases reported had increased regularly by mid-April, notably
through the screening work performed by the local health team. This
affected the locally infected persons in aggregate, but not those that were
imported cases. Since the middle of May, the epidemic appears under control
with the number of daily new cases decreasing and leveling off to a few
cases since the month of August.
The majority of cases were found in the towns of Port (24 percent),
Saint-Denis (16 percent), Sainte-Clotilde (13 percent) and Saint-Pierre
(10 percent). Since the discovery of the 1st case, the surveillance and
prevention measures were reinforced. These consisted principally of active
screening of suspected cases around a reported index case and the
identification and treatment of areas of transmission (anti-mosquito
measures) by the anti-vector campaign. Community-level countermeasures were
equally encouraged, including individual anti-mosquito protection measures
and the destruction of potential habitat. The incidence of new cases
appeared to stabilize during August. Some isolated cases or those in
smaller micro environments continue to be found, principally in the western
communities, where the temperatures remain favorable for mosquito survival.
Consequently, one cannot entirely dismiss the possibility of resurgent
activity with the return of more favorable conditions for mosquito
breeding, if the epidemic is not totally finished by the end of the
southern winter season.
Mayotte
-----
Since the end of April 2005, many cases have been identified in Mayotte,
where anti-mosquito measures have been intensified.
Metropolitan France
-----
Many cases have been confirmed in metropolitan France among those patients
who have returned from the Comoros or Mauritius. There is currently no risk
of secondary transmission in metropolitan France.

[The number of Chikungunya outbreaks since the beginning of 2005 has been
quite high compared with previous years. Additionally, there are many more
Chikungunya outbreaks in the west rim of the Indian Ocean Basin (the
offshore islands of East Africa) than in the east rim. This shift appears
rather peculiar indeed. This moderator requests further
information/explanation from experts in the field. - Mod.RY]
