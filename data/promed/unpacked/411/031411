On Wednesday, the Ecuadorian Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock informed
the Andean Community of its decision to close its border with Peru to
prevent the spread of the livestock-affecting foot-and-mouth disease (FMD).
The ministry will temporarily ban the entrance of products and by-products
of beef, mutton, goat and pork from Peru.
The Ecuadorian Service of Agricultural Sanitation (SESA) urged the
country's ranchers to be on the alert to prevent Ecuadorian livestock from
being infected by the C-virus of the disease. [previous post have mentioned
type A
Meanwhile, the SESA doubled its vigilance on its border with Peru to
prevent the entry of livestock, especially pigs, which are the most likely
carriers of the virus.

[FMD is caused by an aphthovirus of the family Picornaviridae. There are
seven immunologically distinct serotypes: A, O, C, Asia 1, and SAT
(Southern African Territories) 1, 2, and 3. Within each serotype, there is
a large number of strains that exhibit a spectrum of antigenic
characteristics; therefore a number of vaccine strains for each serotype,
particularly O and A, are required to cover the antigenic diversity.
Strains are characterized by their genomic relationships and their
antigenic similarities with established vaccine strains.
FMD is a highly infectious viral infection of cattle, pigs, sheep, goats
and buffalo, and the artiodactyl wildlife specie. It is characterized by
fever; vesicles in the mouth and on the muzzle, teats, and feet; and death
in young animals. - Mod.TG
