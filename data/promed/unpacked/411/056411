A Chinese factory that has not been inspected by the FDA is the
source for the active ingredient of a critical blood-thinning drug
whose production was suspended this week after 350 patients reported
ill effects from it. At least 4 people died after being given the
drug, heparin.

An FDA spokeswoman, Heidi Robello, said Wednesday [13 Feb 2008] that
the agency was making plans to inspect the Chinese factory as well as
a finishing plant in New Jersey "as soon as possible." She said that
"it was yet to be determined" whether the Chinese plant was the source
that led to the spike in reports of problems with the drug's use.

Heparin is made from pig intestines. Ms. Robello said that she did
not know whether the pigs used to produce the suspended product, made
by Baxter International, came from China. Heparin is used widely in
dialysis, heart surgery and chronic care hospitals. Baxter
manufactures half of the nation's supply of the drug, and the
company's suspension of its production of multiuse heparin vials is
expected to lead to shortages.

A Baxter spokeswoman, Erin Gardiner, said her company bought the
active ingredient for the drug from another concern, which she would
not identify. She said that company had plants in the USA and China.

The Government Accountability Office recently reported that at its
current inspection pace, the FDA would need at least 13 years to
inspect every foreign drug plant that exports products to the USA.
The office, an independent arm of Congress, also found that the FDA's
computer systems were deficient and it had little idea how many
plants had been approved for exports to the USA. The quality of
Chinese products became a source of concern last year [2007] after
federal officials discovered that a pet food ingredient shipped from
China contained toxic levels of melamine, which was added to make it
appear higher in protein. Many pets became ill, and some died.
Officials also issued alerts about Chinese seafood, some of it found
to be contaminated. A scandal involving Chinese-made toothpaste that
proved poisonous in Panama led to another alert.

Public health officials noticed a problem with heparin supplies late
in 2007, when children undergoing dialysis at a Missouri hospital had
severe allergic reactions. As officials investigated, they discovered
hundreds of similar cases. Baxter initially recalled some of the
product, but the problems persisted.

The FDA decided to allow Baxter to deliver heparin that it was in the
midst of shipping for fear that a total recall would lead to an
immediate and severe shortage of the drug. The FDA cautioned doctors
to use as little of the Baxter drug as possible and to infuse it into
patients very slowly. The agency also suggested that doctors consider
giving steroids or antihistamines along with the Baxter heparin to
help prevent possible severe allergic reactions.

[The recommendation to use less of the heparin and to infuse to
slowly would not really have an effect in severe allergic reactions
but might in so-called anaphylactoid reactions, which, like the "red
person" syndrome (1) linked to intravenous infusions of the
antimicrobial agent vancomycin, can be minimized by slower infusions.

The FDA announced today [11 Feb 2008] that Baxter Healthcare
Corporation has temporarily stopped manufacturing multiple-dose vials
of the injectable blood-thinning drug heparin due to reports of
serious allergic reactions and hypotension (low blood pressure) in
patients who receive high "bolus" doses of the drug.

Serious reactions to the drug have included difficulty breathing,
nausea, vomiting, excessive sweating, and rapidly falling blood
pressure that can lead to life-threatening shock. Four people have
died after receiving heparin, although the relationship to the drug
is unclear.

Heparin sodium, derived from pig intestines, has been marketed in the
USA since the 1930s. Millions of patients benefit from the
intravenous administration of this drug every year to avoid
potentially life-threatening blood clots in the veins, arteries, and
lungs.

"FDA concurs with Baxter's decision to halt manufacture of heparin
sodium in multiple-dose vials," said Janet Woodcock, MD, FDA's deputy
commissioner for scientific and medical programs, chief medical
officer, and acting director of its Center for Drug Evaluation and
Research. "FDA is vigorously investigating to determine the root
cause of these serious reactions associated with the use of heparin
made by Baxter. In the meantime, patients and health care
professionals who cannot obtain alternative sources of heparin should
use caution in administering any Baxter multiple-dose vials that
remain."

Heparin is commonly used before certain types of surgery, including
coronary artery bypass graft surgery, and in kidney patients before
they undergo dialysis. In some situations, heparin treatment is
initiated using a high bolus dose given directly into the bloodstream
(intravenously) over a short period of time, usually less than one
hour. The reported adverse events occurred in patients who were given
heparin in this form of administration. There are many other uses of
heparin involving lower doses or administration over a longer period
of time; adverse events have not been seen with those uses.

About 350 adverse events associated with the Baxter product have been
reported since the end of 2007 compared to less than 100 reports in
2007. Most of the events have taken place at hemodialysis centers,
almost exclusively involving patients receiving a bolus dose, which
is a high dose administered over a short time. While most of the
reports involve multiple-dose vials, several cases include patients
who received a bolus dose after their health care professional
combined heparin from single-dose vials.

The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services 1st notified
the CDC in January 2008 of several severe allergic-type reactions to
heparin that occurred at a single pediatric hospital beginning in
November 2007. The CDC in turn alerted FDA and Baxter, prompting the
company's voluntary recall of 9 lots of heparin on 17 Jan 2008.

Since then, FDA has learned of adverse events that extend beyond the
recalled lots and involve patients receiving heparin for other
purposes besides hemodialysis. Recent cases have included patients
undergoing cardiac surgery and a specialized blood cell treatment
known as photopheresis.

Over a million multiple-dose vials of heparin are sold per month in
the United States; half of the vials are manufactured by Baxter of
Deerfield, Illinois. FDA is currently investigating whether similar
events have been seen with other heparin manufacturers.

Physicians, dialysis center staff and health care providers are
advised to use an alternate source of heparin or another
blood-thinning drug when possible. When only the Baxter product is
available:

1 - Administer the heparin as an infusion (not a bolus) whenever
possible. Use the lowest dose necessary at the slowest infusion rate
acceptable to obtain the desired clinical effect.

2 - Closely monitor the patient for adverse events, particularly
hypotension and signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity, and ensure
that resuscitation equipment is available.

3 - Consider pre-treatment with corticosteroids (cortisone type
medicines) or antihistamines (drugs that relieve the symptoms of
allergic reactions) although it is not known whether such
pre-treatment is effective.
