Since Nov 2005, officials at the Georgetown Public Hospital
Corporation (GPHC) have been recording a number of persons admitted
with signs and symptoms of the bacterial infection leptospirosis and
7 persons have since died. There has however been no clear pattern in
the cases recorded and 1 death has seen been ruled out as being
caused by the bacteria.
The bacterium can be picked up by humans from water infected by
rodents and other animals. It can happen year-round particularly in
agricultural districts, and it created a scare in 2004 when a large
number of persons in flooded areas fell ill and around 20 persons
died from the disease.
The first of the most recent deaths was recorded in the latter part
of Nov 2005, before the country started to experience heavy rainfall
and a number of areas became flooded. According to Director of
Medical & Professional Services at the hospital, Dr Madan Rambarran,
one of the deaths has since been ruled out as being related to leptospirosis.
Dr Rambarran told Stabroek News that up to Fri, 27 Jan 2006, there
had been 42 admissions to the institution of persons who were showing
signs and symptoms of the disease. He said that in collaboration
with the Pan American Health Organization, authorities have been
tracking down the families of those admitted and those who died in an
effort to determine whether there was a pattern. He noted that the
cases were not from flood-affected areas such as Mahaica, Mahaicony
and Canal Numbers 1 and 2 but were from areas in Georgetown, the East
Bank and even Parika.
"I am not saying that there has been no reported case in
flood-affected areas but what I am saying is there has been no real
pattern to suggest that one flood-affected area may have the
bacterium," he said.
Stabroek News has been informed that on Sat night, 28 Jan 2006, 2
suspected cases were seen but not from flooded areas.
A 34-year-old woman from East La Penitence and a 27-year-old man from
Agricola, East Bank Demerara were the persons admitted. Last week
there was another suspected case from Beterverwagting, East Coast
Demerara, but that turned out not to be so, and the teenager has
since been discharged.
Dr Rambarran said that specimens are being sent to the USA CDC,
adding that he is not clear when they would receive the results for
the other persons who died.
The last death of a person showing signs and symptoms of
leptospirosis occurred on 18 Jan 2006, according to Dr Rambarran.

[As noted in the posting, the lack of a clear association with the
flooded areas speaks against leptospirosis as the cause of these
cases. More diagnostic information is still pending. - Mod.LL]
