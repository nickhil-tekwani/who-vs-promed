A rare disease is affecting dogs in Arrecifes. 50 animals have died for still unknown reasons. They became immobilized and died without vomiting and/or seizures.

"Food poisoning was ruled out on the basis that all animals had eaten food, but not all the animals were affected. This condition may be botulism, considering that the animals just lay on the floor; they are not able to move, and they become rigid. In 30 years working, I have never seen such a thing," Dr. Poggio declared to Cronica.

Meanwhile, the Bromatology office had already started studies in order to determine the cause of this strange illness. There is a possible solution which generated some hope amongst specialists, since there may be some antibiotics available for use, and it is expected that by using these drugs, the condition of the affected animals might improve in one week or 10 days.

[If this were related to the food, then all 30 or more animals would have to be eating the same type of food. This is not alluded to as being the case. However, the epidemiology of this outbreak is not clear.

More information needs to be provided about the type of food (canned, dry, food scraps, etc), the manufacturer of the foods, and most especially the food being consumed by the affected dogs needs to be tested for botulism. However, botulism is a flaccid paralysis not a rigid paralysis. Most dogs ingesting strychnine do have seizures but do not vomit. Some diagnostic work on the animals needs to be conducted. We would appreciate more information these cases. - Mod.TG
