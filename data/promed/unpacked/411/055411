Some 88 people infected with anthrax in northwestern Bangladesh
---------------------------------------------------------------
Some 88 people have been detected with anthrax in 3 villages in
Bangladesh's Sirajganj district, 134 km [83.2 miles] northwest of the
capital Dhaka, 3 weeks after they consumed beef from sick cows.

Civil surgeon of the district Nurul Islam was quoted by the official
news agency BSS on Sunday [22 Aug 2010] that 32 people were found in
Dhopakandi village of Kamarkhand sub-district and 15 persons at
Adachaki village of Belkuchi sub-district of the district. The
disease was 1st found at Chithulia of Shahjadpur sub-district and
later broke out at Kamarkhand and Belkuchi.

The Civil Surgeon said medicines are being distributed free of cost
among the infected people since Thursday [19 Aug 2010] and the
conditions of 41 persons at Chithulia are improving. Medical teams
will be sent to Belkuchi sub-district Monday [23 Aug 2010], he said
with apprehension that the number of affected person might rise.

Deputy Commissioner of the district Aminul Islam said the infected
cattle should be sent to quarantine and given vaccine. He said all
cattle in those farms and domestic animals also should be examined
and start vaccination without further delay.

Shahjadpur, which is known as cattle market, might face huge
financial loss due to the spread of the disease. The country's
largest milk producing company Milkvita is fully dependent on the
milk of the cows of Shahjadpur and other adjoining sub-districts, he said.

Suspected anthrax outbreak in Bangladesh, 112 affected
------------------------------------------------------
At least 112 people have so far fallen ill with suspected anthrax
contracted from consuming meat of ill domestic animals recently in
northwestern Bangladesh, health officials said Monday [23 Aug 2010].

"Some 89 residents in Sirajganj district, some 134 km [83.2 miles]
northwest of capital Dhaka, are suspected to be affected with anthrax
after they consumed beef from sick cows recently," Ramiz Uddin Ahmed,
program officer of the district's civil surgeon office, told Xinhua
Monday. Some 23 additional people in the neighboring Pabna district,
some 216 km [134.2 miles] west of capital Dhaka, are also undergoing
treatment. KM Ashrafuzzaman, civil surgeon of Pabna, told Xinhua
Monday that preliminary tests showed that these people may also have
been infected with anthrax.

Ahmed said about 4 days ago some residents of a village in Sirajganj
came 1st to the hospital with anthrax symptoms. "We sent health
officials to the village and found more people having the similar
symptoms," he said. All of them are responding to treatments and now
recovering, he added.

Infected people informed the health officials that they have consumed
meat of domestic animals which were slaughtered after they had fallen
ill on different occasions in different villages of the districts
since the end of the last month, both the officials said. They said
health officials including doctors are camping in those villages and
treating the patients at their homes. Medicines are being distributed
free of cost among the infected people, they added.

The officials said blood samples of the patients were sent Sunday [22
Aug 2010] to the country's Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control
and Research (IEDCR) in capital Dhaka for testing. A senior IEDCR
official said, "We've to wait another few days to get result of blood
samples testing to confirm whether those people are really infected
with anthrax or not."

Anthrax is an infectious disease caused by _Bacillus anthracis_.
Infection in humans most often involves the skin, the
gastrointestinal tract or the lungs. Anthrax commonly affects hoofed
animals such as sheep and goats, but humans who come into contact
with the infected animals can get sick from anthrax, too.

However, Bangladesh's Directorate of Livestock Services said the
containment measures are already under way. "Hundreds of livestock in
the districts have already been vaccinated," Abdul Bakir, a director
of the Livestock Services, said.

[Obviously the Bangladesh officials are discovering that the more you
look the more you find. With their team in the field they are meeting
a big stream of worried people. What percentage are truly infected is
unclear and may never be known. A 3rd report has some 162 people
infected in 9 separate outbreaks in less than a year
<http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ha6KEMjFjmTRHlEUKtb84XYCoVAA>.

What is clear that there were probably more than 2 infected cattle
slaughtered and butchered, and not just when we include Pabna. Let us
hope that this results in a proper proactive anthrax control and
surveillance programme for Bangladeshi livestock. - Mod.MHJ]
