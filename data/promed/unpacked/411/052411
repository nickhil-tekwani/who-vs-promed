E Goldstein, M Lipsitch, M Cevik. On the effect of age on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in households, schools and the community. The Journal of Infectious Diseases, jiaa691, https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiaa691

Abstract
Background
There is limited information on the effect of age on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection in different settings.

Methods
We reviewed published studies/data on detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection in contacts of COVID-19 cases, serological studies, and studies of infections in schools.

Results
Compared to younger/middle aged adults, susceptibility to infection for children aged under 10 years is estimated to be significantly lower, while estimated susceptibility to infection in adults aged over 60 years is higher. Serological studies suggest that younger adults (particularly those aged under 35 years) often have high cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the community. There is some evidence that given limited control measures, SARS-CoV-2 may spread robustly in secondary/high schools, and to a lesser degree in primary schools, with class size possibly affecting that spread. There is also evidence of more limited spread in schools when some mitigation measures are implemented. Several potential biases that may affect these studies are discussed.

Conclusions
Mitigation measures should be implemented when opening schools, particularly secondary/high schools. Efforts should be undertaken to diminish mixing in younger adults, particularly individuals aged 18-35 years to mitigate the spread of the epidemic in the community.

[Youths aged 18-35 years have largely been ignored in the pandemic, as early in the pandemic, older individuals over 60 years had the highest incidence of severe disease. But recent studies indicate their involvement in virus spread.

MMWR (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6939e1.htm) reported on 2 Oct 2020:
During June-August 2020, COVID-19 incidence was highest in persons aged 20-29 years, who accounted for over 20% of all confirmed cases. Younger adults likely contribute to community transmission of COVID-19. Across the southern United States in June 2020, increases in percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 test results among adults aged 20-39 years preceded increases among those aged greater than or equal to 60 years by 4-15 days.

And the AMA reported on 6 Oct 2020 (https://tinyurl.com/y6do6trv)
Morbidity substantial for young adults
"COVID-19 does not spare young people," wrote Mitchell H. Katz, MD, president and CEO of the NYC Health + Hospitals, the largest municipal health system in the U.S.

In fact, a new study [Cunningham JW, Vaduganathan M, Claggett BL, et al. Clinical Outcomes in Young US Adults Hospitalized With COVID-19. JAMA Intern Med. Published online 9 Sep 2020. doi:10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.5313] says that the disease is spreading rapidly among adults between 18 and 34 years old. Similarly, another study suggests that adults between 20 and 39 years old likely contributed to community spread of COVID-19 in Southern states where a rise in the percentage of positive tests in that age group was followed by a rise in positive test results in adults 60 years and older in the ensuing days and weeks.

"While young adults are much less likely than older persons to become seriously ill, if they reach the point of hospitalization, their risks are substantial," Dr. Katz wrote in a JAMA Internal Medicine Editor's Note [JAMA Intern Med. Published online 9 Sep 2020. doi:10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.5415] commenting on a study by researchers at Brigham and Women's Hospital. The researchers used a national all-payer hospital database to identify 3222 nonpregnant adults aged 18-34 who were admitted to U.S. hospitals for COVID-19 between 1 Apr and 30 Jun 2020. Of those, 21% required intensive care, 10% required mechanical ventilation, and 2.7% died.

"Young adults with [hypertension and obesity] faced risks comparable with those observed in middle-aged adults without them," the study says. "More than half of these patients requiring hospitalization were Black or Hispanic, consistent with prior findings of disproportionate illness severity in these demographic groups."

As MH Katz says in his editorial: "Regardless of age, obesity and hypertension increase risks with COVID-19."

"Given the sharply rising rates of COVID-19 infection in young adults, these findings underscore the importance of infection-prevention measures in this age group," the researchers wrote.

Noting that obesity and hypertension are preventable and treatable conditions, Dr. Katz wrote that "reducing the risk of serious COVID-19 illness should be added to the already long list of reasons to increase medical and public health efforts in young adults to promote healthful diets and increased exercise."

Of course, this is also true for older individuals. - Mod.LK]

[In the 24 hours until 8:00 am yesterday, 29 Oct 2020], 25 people infected with COVID-19 died in the country.

The death toll from the virus now stands at 5886, according to a press release from the Directorate General of Health Services.

Since the 1st 3 coronavirus cases were reported on [8 Mar 2020], 1.45 percent of all confirmed cases have resulted in deaths.

Over the same 24-hour period, 1681 people tested positive for the virus, taking the total number of confirmed cases in the country to 404 760.

Bangladesh is currently 18th in the list of worst affected countries in the world in terms of the number of cases. The country is one place below Iraq and one ahead of Indonesia, according to [https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries].

A total of 14 268 tests were conducted in 111 labs across the country over the 24 hours, and the positivity rate was 11.78 percent. The overall positivity rate stands at 17.52 percent.

Meanwhile, 1548 COVID-19 patients have recovered over the 24 hours, raising the total number of recoveries to 321 281, more than 79 percent of all confirmed cases.

Among the 25 deceased, 16 were male, and 9 were females. One died at home, and the other 24 passed away in hospitals, said the press release. Two were aged between 21 and 30, 3 between 41 and 50, 9 between 51 and 60, and the other 11 were above 60 years old. Of the deceased, one each was from Mymensingh and Barishal divisions; 3 were from Sylhet, 5 from Chattogram, and 15 were from Dhaka division.

https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/active-covid-19-cases-in-india-fall-below-6-lakh/articleshow/78942526.cms


Active COVID-19 cases in the country fell below the 6 lakh [600 000] mark on Thursday [29 Aug 2020], with the number dropping by more than a lakh [100 000] in just 8 days as the slowdown in the pandemic continued. Meanwhile, for the 1st time since the pandemic spread across the country in April [2020], Maharashtra has been displaced as the state recording the highest number of daily cases over any 7-day period. Kerala has emerged as the state posting the highest number of fresh cases over the past 10 days, with the 7-day rolling average of the state overtaking Maharashtra's this Sunday [25 Oct 2020].

No state had crossed Maharashtra's 7-day count of fresh cases until now. Andhra Pradesh came close in the 1st week of August [2020] but did not overtake Maharashtra. That Kerala has taken over the dubious mantle of the number one state in new COVID-19 cases is as much due to the consistent fall in infections in Maharashtra as the rise in numbers in the southern state. In Maharashtra, the 7-day average has fallen by more than 2/3rds from a peak of 22 149 on [15 Sep 2020] to 6158 on [26 Oct 2020].

Kerala's graph peaked at [8728 on 11 Oct 2020] and has shown a marginal decline since then to 7089 on [28 Oct 2020]. Meanwhile, active cases in the country stood at 598 946 on [Thu 29 Oct 2020], as per TOI's database collated from state government figures. Active cases had peaked at 1 026 945 on [17 Sep 2020] and have been falling since then in sync with the slowdown in the pandemic. This is now the lowest count of active cases since [5 Aug 2020].

India reported 49 070 new cases on [Thu 29 Oct 2020], taking the total caseload to 8 088 182. This was a slight drop from Wednesday's [28 Oct 2020] tally of 50 224 new cases. The day's death toll was 554, the highest in the past 5 days. The slight spike in fatalities, which had touched a low of 489 on Sunday [25 Oct 2020], was due to higher numbers reported from Maharashtra (156) and Chhattisgarh.

Delhi registered 5739 new cases on Thursday [29 Oct 2020], its highest single-day tally so far, amid a 3rd surge in the pandemic in the capital. Maharashtra's coronavirus tally on [Thu 29 Oct 2020] increased to 1 666 668 with 5902 new cases, a health official said.

Nepal on [Thu 29 Oct 2020] reported 2364 new cases of coronavirus infection from across the country. With this, the nationwide infection count has advanced to 164 718.

Of the total infections, 984 are females and 1380 are males.

In the last 24 hours, 1338 cases surfaced in Kathmandu district while Lalitpur and Bhaktapur reported 180 and 97 cases respectively. Of the total infections in the valley, 704 are females and 911 are males. Kathmandu's active infection count is 16 521 while those of Lalitpur and Bhaktapur are 2470 and 1075 respectively.

Likewise, 3038 people who were earlier infected with the virus were reported to have recovered in the past 24 hours as per the latest data provided by the health ministry. As of today [29 Oct 2020], 124 862 individuals have recovered from the novel coronavirus infection. The recovery rate, as such, is 75.8 per cent.

Nepal's active COVID-19 case count currently stands at 38 952.

Meanwhile, 17 more fatalities from the disease have taken the total death toll to 904.

According to the health ministry, 9769 PCR tests were conducted in the last 24 hours. With this, 1 419 064 tests have been carried out to date [29 Oct 2020]. It is to be noted that minimal PCR tests are being conducted in the last few days as testing has stopped at most of the labs due to the ongoing Dashain festival [Dashain, also Bijaya Dasami, is a festival originating from Nepal that celebrates the victory of good over evil. In other parts of South Asia, it is called Dashera https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashain]

Currently, there are 2689 individuals in various quarantine facilities across Nepal.

On Wednesday [28 Oct 2020], 1954 new cases of coronavirus infection were recorded from across the country which had taken the nationwide infection count to 162 354.

- The Americas region reported 29.9% of daily case numbers and 39.0% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, maintaining its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 20.3 million cases. The USA maintains its dominance, followed by Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, Canada, and Peru. Chile and Costa Rica also reported more than 1000 new cases in the past 24 hours.

- The European region reported 52.1% of daily case numbers and 39.5% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 10.8 million. Countries not reporting cases today (31 Oct 2020) include Belgium, Kazakhstan, Sweden, Hungary, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. France is dominant, followed by Italy, Spain, UK, Poland, Germany, Russia, Czech Republic, Netherlands, Switzerland, Ukraine, Romania, Austria, Portugal, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Armenia, and Turkey.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 5.4% of daily case numbers and 9.7% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of greater than 3.0 million cases. Iran is dominant with (record-breaking highs), followed by Jordan, Tunisia, Morocco, Iraq, Lebanon, UAE and Pakistan. Libya, Kuwait, and the Palestinian Authority each reported more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000, while Oman, Sudan, Somalia and Yemen did not report any cases in the past 24 hours.

- The African region reported 1.0% of daily case numbers and 1.5% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.3 million cases. South Africa is dominant, followed by Kenya, Ethiopia, Algeria, Angola, Mozambique, Uganda, Reunion and Nigeria.

- The Western Pacific region reported 0.72% of daily case numbers and 0.75% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.73 million cases. As previously, the Philippines maintains its dominance, followed by Malaysia, Japan, South Korea, Guam, and China.

- The South East Asia region reported 10.8% of the daily newly reported cases and 9.5% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 9.1 million cases.

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (86 293), India (46 715), France (35 641), and Italy (31 756) have been dominant. A global total of 6449 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (30-31 Oct 2020). Countries not reporting any new cases include Spain, Switzerland, Bolivia, Sweden, and Oman. It is now taking 2 days to add 1 million new cases... there are now more than 46 million cases. If transmission continues at the same level the world will cross the 50 million cumulative cases in a bit more than a week.

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (12 countries) include the USA, India, France, Italy, UK (21 915), Poland (21 897), Belgium (20 056), Russia (18 140), Brazil (16 077), Germany (14 070), Czech Republic (11 429), and Colombia (11 033). A total of 53 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 28 of the 53 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 10 are from the Americas region, 7 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, and 5 are from the South East Asia region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 15.7%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 12.9%. The USA (dominant in the Americas region) has increased daily reported cases by 18.4% and deaths by 3.8%. Iran (dominant in the Eastern Mediterranean region) has increased daily case reports by 38.2% and deaths by 15.8%.

Impression: Global daily reported cases continue to increase with countries in the European region and the Americas region showing the largest increases in daily new cases counts, followed by the Eastern Mediterranean and the South East Asia regions. That being said, the total counts are somewhat lower today (31 Oct 2020) with the beginning of the weekend-reporting artifact. - Mod.MPP]
