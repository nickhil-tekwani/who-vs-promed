For the 1st time in nearly a decade, bubonic plague has been confirmed in Riverside County. State health officials said Thursday [4 Oct 2012] that a ground squirrel tested positive.

It was found during routine testing at the Fern Basin campground in the San Jacinto Mountains north of Idyllwild. It's an area where similar findings were an annual occurrence in the 1990's.

Bubonic plague is a bacterial disease that can be transmitted from wild rodents to humans through bites from infected fleas.

Campers are being warned to stay away from squirrels and other wild animals. Further testing of animals is planned to determine if dusting is warranted.

[The causative bacterium, _Yersinia pestis_, is transmitted to people through fleabites and direct contact with infected animals. Each rodent species is host to one or more species of fleas which, when infected, are carriers. These fleas generally do not infest other animals unless their natural hosts are unavailable.

Domestic cats and dogs can also contract plague from infective fleas. They may carry infected fleas home to their owners or, especially cats, serve as a direct source of infection. There are many flea treatments and repellents appropriate for pets available. Some products may be suitable for dogs but not cats or may be suitable for an adult but not a younger animal. Be sure to consult your veterinarian, as some products may be toxic to cats, kittens, and puppies, even resulting in fatalities.

Clinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front leg (the armpit if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever. Please take your pet to a veterinarian if you notice any abnormalities. Veterinarians should protect themselves by wearing gloves when examining these swellings. A bubo that ruptures may infect the veterinarian or even the pet owner if the pet owner is the one palpating the swelling.

Another form of the disease is the respiratory form. Cats may acquire this form and can spread it to their owners or the veterinarians through infected expiratory droplets. People are also prone to the respiratory infection as well.

You should also be aware that fleas that hitchhike into your home via a pet vehicle and can also transmit disease to you, the owner, or caretaker of the pet.
