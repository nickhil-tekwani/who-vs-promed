Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus Kills 3 Transplant Patients
--------------------------------------------------------------
One transplant patient needed 2 lungs. Another needed a liver. 2 more
needed kidneys. Hope for all 4 came in the form of a Rhode Island
organ donor. But those hopes were shattered when it emerged the donor
had an extremely rare rodent-borne infection -- possibly from her pet
hamster -- when she died of unrelated causes.
A few weeks after the transplants in mid-April 2005, 3 patients died:
a liver recipient and a double-lung recipient, both from
Massachusetts, and a kidney transplant recipient from Rhode Island.
Another Rhode Island patient who received a kidney became ill, but is
recovering. Public health officials who announced the deaths on Mon
23 May 2005 said it was only the second documented case of
lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), which is associated with
exposure to rodent waste, being spread through an organ transplant.
They stressed that LCMV is rare in humans. "We would encourage
people who are on the (transplant) waiting list not to be concerned
with this," state health director David Gifford said. "This is an
extremely rare and unusual event."
Health officials discovered the connection between the donor and the
patients after a doctor at the Rhode Island hospital, where one of
the transplantations was performed, reported an unusual viral death.
Investigators traced the death to the organ donor. The double lung
transplant was performed at Brigham & Women's Hospital in Boston, the
liver transplant at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, and
both kidney transplants at Rhode Island Hospital in Providence,
officials said.
Gifford said there are no plans to begin testing other donor organs
for the virus since it is so rare and testing could take several
days, potentially making the organs unusable. He said he believed
there was no commercially available test for the virus.
2 other people received corneas from the Rhode Island donor in
operations outside the United States. Officials from the federal
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said they are
investigating where those corneas went.
LCMV is commonly found in house mice but usually produces only
flu-like [febrile] symptoms in humans. It has also been associated
with neurological illness and miscarriage in pregnant women. In this
case, however, the victims were transplant recipients, who were
taking very large doses of immunosuppressant medication as part of
their treatment, which can allow viruses to multiply and cause an
"overwhelming infection," Gifford said.
Only one previous instance of LCMV causing a transplant-related death
has been reported -- in Wisconsin in December 2003 -- but it wasn't
definitively linked to rodent exposure, said Dr. Matthew Kuehnert of
the CDC. CDC investigators were testing the dead hamster, purchased
at a Warwick pet shop, to confirm the virus as the cause of the
recent deaths. "We believe the hamster was the source, but we can't
rule out a common house mouse," said CDC spokesman Dave Daigle.
[Addendum: The Petsmart pet shop where the donor bought the hamster
has stopped selling mice and hamsters and has given its import and
sales records to the state Department of Environmental Management,
Gifford said. Jennifer Pflugfelder, spokeswoman for Phoenix-based
Petsmart, said the CDC took away about 60 hamsters, mice, and rats
last week, and the remaining animals were taken from the shop Monday
morning, she said. She didn't know how many were removed altogether.]

[Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) is the type species of the
family _Arenaviridae_. Other arenaviruses are either not associated
with human disease or are responsible for severe hemorrhagic fevers.
Arenaviruses are enveloped negative-stranded RNA viruses with
bi-partite genomes and are rodent-borne. LCMV was isolated in 1933
and subsequently shown to be a cause of aseptic meningitis in humans,
as well as frequent, asymptomatic infections in laboratory mice (_Mus
musculus_). In mice the virus is maintained both by vertical
transmission in utero and via the gastrointestinal tract.
Rodent-to-human transmission probably occurs via aerosols and
fomites. It has been estimated that about 8 percent of viral
meningitis cases in the United States can be attributed to LCMV
infection, but most LCMV infections are mild or subclinical and their
incidence in the general population of the USA may be as high as
10-15 percent.
Therefore there is an appreciable risk of transmission of LCMV by
organ donation, particularly as the incident recorded above is the
2nd such event. Recent instances of transmission of pathogenic
viruses by organ donation have included transmission of virulent
viruses such as dengue, rabies, and West Nile.
There has been much discussion of the need to screen donors and
donated organs for presence of overtly pathogenic viruses [see
ProMED-mail posts listed below]. However, the feasibility of
pre-screening for presence of agents such as LCMV, which are
associated predominantly with asymptomatic infections, is
problematic. Nonetheless, in view of the unpredicted lethality of
LCMV transmitted by organ donation, this question should be addressed
again.
Further information on the consequences of the corneal transplants would be
appreciated. - Mod.CP]
