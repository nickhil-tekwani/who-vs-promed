A total of 20 persons were sent to hospital for treatment in the
eastern resort of Rayong Sunday afternoon [6 Dec 2009] for treatment
after inhaling a butane chemical substance accidentally leaked near
the sprawling Map Ta Phut Industrial Estate.

Sunday's incident marked the 2nd recent accident after 18 workers
were sent to the same hospital Saturday [5 Dec 2009] for inhaled gas
during a leakage incident with 5 of them still in critical condition.

The 20 workers were hospitalised after butane leaked while being
transported from a factory to the Map Ta Phut port. No one has
[claimed] responsibility for either accident so far.

The incidents took place while members of a 4-party panel chaired by
former prime minister Anand Panyarachun visited residents in Map Ta
Phut municipality for the 1st time on Saturday [5 Dec 2009] to gain
first-hand information on industrial pollution in the area.

In November [2009], the government appointed a panel to resolve
problems prevailing in the area after the Administrative Court
temporarily suspended 76 industrial projects in September.

To date, the court has allowed only 11 of a total 76 projects to
continue their operations while 65 will remain shuttered until a full
court hearing takes place and resolves the matter.

Tasked with accelerating the government's overall response and
balanced assessment as an independent body under Article 67 of the
Constitution, the committee will be established to ensure that each
project conducts an environmental impact assessment (EIA) and a
health impact assessment (HIA), the panel members will stay in the
province until Monday [7 Dec 2009]. The independent body will be set up later.

[Butane is an aliphatic hydrocarbon and is most often a gas, and can
be inhaled. Butane is explosive and flammable and frequently misused
as an inhalant. Those inhalants enter the body through the pulmonary
system where they are free to enter the circulation to produce
toxicity very rapidly. Acute effects may include dizziness,
tachycardia, hypertension, disorientation, lack of coordination,
confusion, slurred speech, hallucinations, delirium, and even
suicidal attempts.

Depending on the dose recovery may take from minutes to hours, or may
not happen at all. The butane may displace oxygen from the red blood
cells and result in tissue hypoxia and ultimately asphyxiation.

Generally removing the patient from the area will often result in
recovery but respiratory and cardiovascular support should be given
and these systems monitored for a few hours. Stimulants are contraindicated.

Butane is a fuel and may be found in aerosols, camping stoves,
lighter fluid, and refills for lighters and blow torches. Pure grades
can be used in calibrating instruments and even as a food additive. - Mod.TG]
