Statement on the Schmallenberg Virus Situation Issued by the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health (SCoFCAH) - 11 Jan 2012:

The information presented by Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium at the meeting of 11 Jan 2012 shows that a newly detected virus has circulated in the 2nd semester of 2011 amongst livestock ruminants, causing non-specific clinical signs in cattle and congenital malformations, mainly in sheep and more seldom in cattle and goats.

The Member States and the Commission acknowledge the efforts made by these 3 Member States to provide the best possible scientific information on the risks posed by this virus, in full transparency.

The virus in question belongs to the Bunyaviridae family, genus _Orthobunyavirus_ and has been tentatively named "Schmallenberg virus." This virus belongs to a vector-transmitted group of viruses making direct transmission from animal to animal unlikely. However, vertical transmission from dam to newborn via the intrauterine route does occur as with other similar viruses. This group of viruses very often are associated with mild clinical signs of disease or with subclinical infection in ruminants.

So far, cases of disease have been detected in 20 farms in Germany (in cattle and sheep) [see comment], in 52 farms in the Netherlands (in sheep, and one case in a goat) [as of 11 Jan 2012, the number of confirmed sheep farms is 55], and in 14 farms in Belgium (in sheep, only) [as of 11 Jan 2012, the number of confirmed sheep farms is 17]. No clear geographical clusters of these cases has been shown so far. This may suggest that the undetected subclinical cases of infection in ruminants may be many more, but the current lack of serological tests renders epidemiological investigations difficult.

Although the congenital malformation in newborn animals have been detected recently and are still being detected in these days, they are most likely caused by transmission of virus by insect vectors that occurred in summer and early autumn during pregnancy.

There is no evidence that the Schmallenberg virus could cause illness in humans. The Member States and the Commission took note of the preliminary assessment carried out by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) on the zoonotic risks of the Schmallenberg virus, which indicates that "it is unlikely that this virus can cause disease in humans, but it cannot be completely excluded at this stage."

The Member States and the Commission recognise that the information on the Schmallenberg virus is still fragmented and mostly extrapolated from data available on genetically similar viruses in the _orthobunyaviridae_ genus (Simbu serogroup, like the Akabane virus). The situation needs to be reassessed once new data is available. Awareness should be improved amongst veterinary services and stakeholders in order to better understand and address the possible risks associated with this virus.

Given that this virus is likely transmitted by means of insect vectors, further virus circulation in the current winter is unlikely to occur. This will allow Member States time to gather further data and to plan further actions in view of a possible reoccurrence of disease in spring and summer [2012].

The Member States and the Commission consider that it is, therefore, necessary to continue field investigations and surveys on this virus that would generate data on which the possible disease control measures should be based. They, therefore, agree to develop a guidance document on surveillance as a matter of urgency. The Member States also invited the Commission to identify possible ways to provide financial support to the above investigations.

[Case definition for SBV will help to accurately assess the situation. While "cases of disease," for the Netherlands and Belgium, mean holdings where congenital malformations have been recorded and the fingerprints of SBV lab confirmed, the "cases of disease ... detected in 20 farms in Germany (in cattle and sheep)" may include also the clinical cases, particularly in cattle, seen earlier (August-September 2011), which included also virus isolations. Hopefully, detailed information will be included in the presentations discussed during the meeting, which are expected to become publicly available soon.

An updated (11 Jan 2012) map of SBV in the Netherlands is available at http://www.vwa.nl/txmpub/files/?p_file_id=2201854, and of Belgium at http://www.afsca.be/_pictures/users/Schmallenberg_20120111_000.jpg.

According to DEFRA's information: "France is now also officially requiring notification" (see 20120107.0049). Available information from France, if reports have already been received, will be helpful. Sporadic congenital malformations in ruminants may be seen anywhere, any year; they may be caused by several pathogens and also by non-infectious agents. - Mod.AS
