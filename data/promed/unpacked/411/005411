KABUL: Monday, Afghan officials and residents expressed concern over a
sudden increase in number of dog bite cases and an acute shortage of
anti-rabies vaccines, causing fatalities in the capital city. Residents
said rabid dogs in different parts of Kabul attacked at least 80 people
last month [March], with most of the victims dying for lack of vaccines.
"Rabies cases are rising every day because the environment is infected,"
senior health ministry official Sarwar Abbasi said. He admitted the Taliban
regime was facing a shortage of vaccine and the municipal administration
had not launched a campaign to vaccinate or kill stray dogs. "We do not
have control programs, sufficient vaccines and regular schemes to vaccinate
or exterminate stray dogs," Abbasi said.
The number of cases of rabies in March rose by 50 percent over February,
health officials said. Residents said 35 people, mostly children, were
attacked by rabid dogs in the city's Microrayan and Qalai Zaman Khan areas.
Zar Alam, whose only daughter was bitten by a rabid dog in Microrayan, said
for the past 10 days he had been seeking treatment for her in vain. "There
is no vaccine. We are wandering from the health ministry to the aid
agencies, but there is no help," he said. "There are more parents like me."
He called on the international health agencies to rush the badly needed
vaccines to Afghanistan. Health officials said the victims who could afford
to, have to travel to Pakistan to receive the complete course of 5
anti-rabies doses.
The World Health Organization (WHO) supplied 300 ampules to the public
health ministry 4 months ago, enough for only 60 people, they said. An aid
group supported by Afghans living in Germany used to vaccinate the rabies
victims in Kabul, but it has also run out of the stocks, they added.
Senior WHO official Attaullah Zarabi confirmed the increase in rabies
cases. "It is on the rise. Even our own staff have seen people being
attacked by rabid dogs," he said. There would have been no shortage of the
vaccines had the local authorities informed the WHO in advance, Zarabi
said, adding it would have taken only 2 weeks to get vaccines into the
country. "This is their responsibility to write a proposal to us," the WHO
official said.

[The senior WHO official makes an interesting statement that Afghanistan
should have informed WHO in advance. Rarely are we able to predict
outbreaks in advance. However, lack of programs to vaccinate dogs is
serious, as this article points out. There may be a lack of canine vaccine
as well as a lack of post-exposure prophylaxis. The local practice of
allowing dogs to roam may also affect the situation. Although it may not be
possible for cultural or manpower reasons, institution of leash laws would
greatly benefit the city, most probably in decreasing the number of human
rabies cases. ­ Mod.TG]
