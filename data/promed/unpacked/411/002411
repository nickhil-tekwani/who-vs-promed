I would like the opportunity to clarify some matters regarding this case.
The 76 year old woman who died had acute Q fever. She had underlying
medical conditions which resulted in a poor prognosis.
I would also like to point out that I did not say that the risk of
any further cases has passed. I said that it was unlikely but not
impossible that there would be more cases related to this outbreak,
because the incubation period has passed and there have not been
animals at the abattoir since the middle of April [2007]. However, as
long as there are people living in close proximity to abattoirs there
will be a risk of transmission of Q fever as has happened in this situation.
