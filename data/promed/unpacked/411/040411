The acute renal insufficiency syndrome (SIRA in its Spanish initials)
took 2 more lives Thursday night [26 Oct 2006], increasing the number
of deaths to 36 in the 26 days since the crisis became public.
However, yesterday's statement [27 Oct 2006] from the Ministry of
Health only reported 34 deaths. [21 more deaths in the 2 weeks since
the last ProMED report -- see ref. below. - Mod JW]
Nestor Sossa, member of the Ministry of Health's Institutional
Technical Committee, confirmed the new deaths last night. The tragedy
quietly grows, and it could get worse. Of the 44 hospitalized,
according to the official count, 7 are in critical condition. In the
opinion of the director general of Health, Cirilio Lawson, the
hospitalized patients' the prognosis is "tentative."
In the meantime, the Social Security director, Rene Luciani, answered
the 25 questions from the Attorney General's Office regarding
medicine production procedures in the laboratory of that institution,
from which the 4 contaminated pharmaceutical products came [7 have
been withdrawn -- see comment below. - Mod.JW]

[There is evidence from other sources that the contaminant is
diethylene glycol -- see ref. below, which includes the information
that "(...the MOH has withdrawn 7 products from the market), but it
does appear as though expectorant syrup without sugar is
epidemiologically linked to the cases." - Mod.TG/JW]
