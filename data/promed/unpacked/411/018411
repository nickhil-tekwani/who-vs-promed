The NPPO of Israel recently informed EPPO of the 1st report of '_Candidatus_ Phytoplasma pyri' (EPPO A2 List) on its territory. During 2020-2021, symptomatic trees of almond (_Prunus dulcis_), peach and nectarine (_Prunus persica_), and pear (_Pyrus communis_) were observed in the north of the country. Symptomatic leaf samples were tested (PCR, sequencing). Results confirmed '_Ca._ Phytoplasma pyri', subgroup 16SrX-C, in commercial orchards of nectarine and pear in some areas. The origin of the disease in Israel is unknown.

Surveys are ongoing in nurseries cultivating potential host plants of '_Ca._ P. pyri' within the infected areas. Potential _Cacopsylla_ vector species are being tested for acquisition and transmission of the phytoplasma. Initial results have shown that _C. bidens_, which is present in Israel, can acquire the phytoplasma, however transmission by this species in Israel has not been proven yet. Growers and nurseries have been instructed to report any symptoms and to avoid any movement of propagation material from the infested area to prevent spread of the disease.

[The causal agents of pear decline (PD; _Candidatus_ Phytoplasma pyri) and the related apple proliferation (_Ca._ P. mali) are members of the 16SrX apple proliferation taxonomic group. They cause serious diseases in the respective crops with quantitative as well as qualitative losses in fruit production. _Cacopsylla_ psyllid species, for PD in particular _C. pyricola_ (pear psyllid), have been implicated as vectors. Another member of the group (_Ca._ P. prunorum) causes European stone fruit yellows.

PD can occur as quick or slow decline, depending on environmental conditions, root stocks, and cumulative effects of other root pathogens (such as _Phytophthora_). Trees may wilt, scorch, and die within a few weeks or lose vigour slowly over several seasons. Abnormal early red leaf colouration occurs frequently on affected trees due to root damage. Quick decline may be preceded by the slow form.

Phytoplasmas can be spread with infected plant material (tissue cultures, grafting) and by sap-sucking planthopper vectors. Disease outbreaks tend to occur in cycles, being favoured by hot, dry conditions which stimulate vector migration into crops. Disease management for phytoplasmas may include phytosanitation, vector control, removal of pathogen and/or vector reservoirs (volunteer crop plants, weeds), use of certified clean planting/propagation material, as well as resistant crop varieties.
