The individual will join an international team of over 45 global health specialists located in 32 countries. Coverage of events outside the region but with potential importance to the region is also expected.

Actively and regularly search the internet -- including the world-wide web, local media, disease outbreak sources of information (such as HealthMap), social media platforms, and relevant blogs -- for reports of outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases in the region and particularly focusing on North Africa and neighboring Sub-Saharan countries.
3. Using an online dashboard tool, post relevant reports of events of interest in human/animal health to the MENA region with appropriate commentary, in a timely manner (less than 24 hours).

Inter - and intra - staff:
7. Assist in training of new staff.

10. Set a regular schedule with the regional moderator and ProMED Deputy Editor and notify him/her in advance of any expected absence from moderation duties.
11. Contact the regional moderator with any questions or suggestions for improving ProMED-MENA.

Qualifications
--------------
1. An advanced degree in the animal health field required (DVM, PhD in microbiology or similar field). Additional advanced degree in a related field preferred (MPH or participation in an international Field Epidemiology Training Program).
