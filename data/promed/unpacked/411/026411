First Report of Soybean Rust in South Africa
------------------
Z. A. Pretorius, Department of Plant Pathology, University of the Free
State, Bloemfontein 9300, South Africa; F. J. Kloppers, PANNAR (Pty)
Ltd., P.O. Box 19, Greytown 3250, South Africa; and R. D. Frederick,
USDA ARS Foreign Disease-Weed Science Research Unit, 1301 Ditto
Ave., Fort Detrick, MD 21702. Plant Dis. 85:1288, 2001; published on-
line as D-2001-1015-01N, 2001. Accepted for publication 21 Sep 2001.
In February 2001, rust caused by _Phakopsora pachyrhizi_ Syd. [Pr
was detected for the first time on soybean (_Glycine max_ (L.) Merr.)
near Vryheid in northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. As the season
progressed, the disease was also observed in other parts of the
province, and epidemic levels were reached in the Karkloof, Cedara,
Howick, and Greytown production regions.
In affected areas, infection foci gradually increased in size and caused
premature yellowing and defoliation of soybean crops, usually after the
flowering stage. Typical rust symptoms (3) were produced
predominantly on the lower surface of soybean leaves. [The disease ...
subsequently spread to Amsterdam and Ermelo in the Highveld region
of South Africa.
Following emergency registration of triazole compounds, fungicides
were ... used to control soybean rust, especially in the more humid
eastern production areas. Available yield data suggested a reduction in
kernel mass between 4 and 23%, depending on the cultivar and host
growth stage at the time of infection.
Urediniospores from the original collection (isolate PREM 57280, Plant
Protection Research Institute, Pretoria, South Africa) were 23 to 33 x
15 to 22 micrometers, ... within the known range for Pr ... (3). To
confirm pathogenicity, 10 to 15 plants of each of the South African
soybean cvs. Pan 589, Pan 780, Pan 854, Octa, and Prima were
inoculated with isolate PREM 57280. Primary leaves were sprayed with
a suspension of spores in light mineral oil ([ca ... 1 mg of spores per
ml) before incubating plants in the dark in a dew chamber for 16 h.
Large, sporulating uredinia, producing typical soybean rust
urediniospores, developed on all inoculated plants.
Classical and real-time fluorescent [PCR ... assays as well as sequence
analysis of the internal transcribed spacer regions verified [that ...
isolate PREM 57280 [was Pr... (2).
Since the disease is known to occur in Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and
several other African countries (1,3,4), inoculum was most likely
introduced by air currents from countries to the north of South Africa.
It is highly probable that soybean rust will successfully overwinter in
South Africa based on experience in other southern African countries.
