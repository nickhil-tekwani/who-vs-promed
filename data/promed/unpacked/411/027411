Indonesian child dies from H5N1 infection
-----------------------------------------
Indonesia's health ministry today announced that a 2-year-old boy [from Bekasi, Jawa Barat province] died from an H5N1 avian influenza infection, according to a translated statement posted on FluTrackers [see Flutrackers.com, http://www.flutrackers.com/forum/showthread.php?t=207753]. The boy got sick on 10 Jun 2013 and was treated by a pediatrician for a fever. His condition worsened, and he was hospitalized on 18 Jun 2013 and placed on a ventilator in an intensive care unit. He tested positive for H5N1 and died the following day.

An investigation into the source of his infection revealed that his mother had bought chicken pieces from a possibly contaminated market 2 days before he got sick. The new case raises Indonesia's tally of H5N1 infections to 193 and its death toll to 161.
