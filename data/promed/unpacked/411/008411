Public Health Dispatch: Pertussis in an Infant Adopted from Russia -- May
2002
------------------------------------------------------
On 2 May 2002, the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services
notified CDC about an infant aged 10 months adopted from Russia who had
culture-confirmed pertussis diagnosed. On 8 Apr 2002, the adoptive parents
picked him up in the orphan ward at hospital A in Bryansk and noticed that
the child had upper respiratory congestion and cough. The adoptive parents
reported that the infant had not received any vaccinations and that another
infant living in the same room in hospital A had a severe cough. The
adopted infant subsequently was examined by a local physician, who
diagnosed his condition as a "cold," and the infant was taken to the U.S.
Embassy in Moscow, where the parents were interviewed for an immigrant visa
for the child.
On 24 Apr 2002, the infant and his parents traveled from Moscow to Raleigh,
North Carolina, through New York on commercial airline flights. On 26 Apr
2002, the infant was seen as an outpatient at a local clinic; a culture of
a nasopharyngeal swab confirmed infection with _Bordetella pertussis_. The
infant improved after treatment with clarithromycin and was administered
the first dose of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis
vaccine (DTaP). The parents were placed on azithromycin for prophylaxis.
CDC is collaborating with the U.S. Embassy, adoption agencies, visa
applicant medical clinics in Moscow, and the airline to identify and notify
persons who might have been exposed to the infant during his communicable
period. The airline is working to identify those passengers who might have
been exposed to the infant during his flights to North Carolina. CDC is
collaborating with state health departments, who are notifying and ensuring
appropriate chemoprophylaxis and vaccination for exposed passengers in
their jurisdiction.
Health-care providers and public health officials are advised to consider
pertussis when evaluating or notified of a person with an acute illness
characterized by cough with paroxysms, whoop, or post-tussive gagging or
vomiting. Following are CDC guidelines on the management of patients with
pertussis and their contacts:
For symptomatic patients, test by culture of nasopharyngeal aspirate or
swab; a nasopharyngeal Dacron swab should be used. Swabs or aspirate should
be placed in Regan Lowe transport media if direct inoculation of selective
media is not possible.
For hospitalized patients, respiratory isolation (droplet precautions) is
recommended for at least the first 5 days of antimicrobial treatment.
For symptomatic patients, the treatment of choice for pertussis is
erythromycin for 14 days. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxozole is an alternative
antibiotic. Limited clinical data suggest that newer macrolides, such as
azithromycin for 5-7 days or clarithromycin for 14 days, might be as
effective as erythromycin in the treatment of pertussis and are
alternatives for patients who cannot tolerate erythromycin.
For exposed persons, chemoprophylaxis is recommended to limit secondary
transmission. Exposure is defined as having face-to-face contact, having
direct contact with respiratory, oral, or nasal secretions, or being in the
same room with a coughing pertussis case-patient. The recommended
chemoprophylaxis regimen is erythromycin for 14 days. Alternative therapies
are the same as for symptomatic patients.
Pertussis vaccination should be initiated or continued according to the
recommended schedule for exposed children aged under 7 years who are
undervaccinated or who have received fewer than 4 DTaP doses. Exposed
children may receive DTaP dose 2 or 3 if 4 weeks have elapsed after dose 1
or 2, respectively. Children may receive DTaP dose 4 as early as age 12
months, and preferably 6 months after dose 3. Children should be
administered DTaP dose 5 unless a dose was given within the last 3 years or
they are aged over 7 years.

[The occurrence of pertussis in an unvaccinated child is not unusual in
many parts of the world. This event serves as a reminder to all of us of
the continued importance of pertussis as a childhood disease in areas of
the world where childhood immunization coverages are not at adequate levels
to affect transmission. This case also begs the question of whether
childhood vaccinations should be part of pre-adoptive recommendations,
especially for children coming from countries where childhood vaccination
levels are lower. Given the huge effort involved in tracing this child's
contacts en route from Russia to the USA/NC, one wonders if this might have
been somewhat prevented by a vaccination requirement similar to the school
entry requirements all states currently have. Granted the vaccine does not
have 100 percent efficacy and therefore there is no guarantee that
pertussis in this child specifically could have been prevented (just trying
to preempt some reader comments here), but it still seems like a reasonable
topic of discussion. (Why do I think I'm now opening myself up to a
barrage of emails in response to this?) - Mod.MPP]
