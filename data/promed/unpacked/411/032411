The comment in the post states:
"CAE virus infection is widespread among dairy goats in most industrialized countries but rare among indigenous goat breeds of developing countries unless they have been in contact with imported goats. In countries such as Canada, Norway, Switzerland, France, and the USA, seroprevalence of CAE virus is over 65 percent." Source: https://www.merckvetmanual.com/generalized-conditions/caprine-arthritis-and-encephalitis/overview-of-caprine-arthritis-and-encephalitis.

However, the information about the CAE-situation in Switzerland is incorrect.

In Switzerland, the CAE virus was successfully eradicated from goats. Since the end of 2018, the Swiss goat population has been considered free of CAE.

For more information please consult the homepage of the Swiss Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office at https://www.blv.admin.ch/blv/fr/home/tiere/tierseuchen/uebersicht-seuchen/alle-tierseuchen/cae.html and in particular the report "L'eradication de l'arthrite encephalite caprine en Suisse" at https://www.blv.admin.ch/dam/blv/fr/dokumente/tiere/tierkrankheiten-und-arzneimittel/praevention/bericht-ausrottung-cae.pdf.download.pdf/CAE_Bericht_FR.pdf. (in French)".
