I have been practicing in Palmdale, California, for many years. The number of cases are probably not a major outbreak, as we see parvo cases all year long. (I was practicing in Los Angeles when parvovirus 1st appeared in 1978.) The county has required reporting of parvo cases for several years, but most practices may have not been submitting the case reports to the County Veterinarian. I am now in a new practice and we are submitting cases that we see. We're seeing a few more cases because it is spring, like has happened in the past.

Other veterinarians may also be submitting cases that have not done so in the past. (The 1st TV report I heard said there was an outbreak with 7 cases in Palmdale/Lancaster before we sent our report.) We just submitted a report with 8 or so cases. One was a female and her 3 puppies. So the increased numbers could be a statistical phenomenon.

Most of the cases are in puppies or dogs under a year of age. These pets are usually under vaccinated. Often people adopt puppies from Animal Control, where they have received only one vaccination for parvo. The owners think their pets are protected and don't go to see a veterinarian to have their puppy examined, which most veterinarians do for free for Animal Control adoptees. Then the 1st time we see them they are sick. They don't know that puppies need a series of vaccines to try to protect the puppy when the maternal antibodies decline, the age at which varies from pet to pet. The other group we see is people getting puppies from friends and neighbors and never starting them on their vaccination series. Fortunately, most people do take their puppies in for exams and vaccines. These people don't usually have a problem.

[Peter Cyrog's communication is greatly appreciated, not just for the content but because in ProMED we depend on members' observations from the trenches, both as a "heads up" for new events, but also, as in this instance, for adding depth. It would be appreciated if the Los Angeles County Veterinarian would share with us what he is seeing from the bridge, the nature of this "epidemic" (if it is), and how it compares with previous years. I would not be surprised if the previous report by DogChannel.com was taken from a news release -- journalists are by nature professional plagiarists. And Peter's advice on getting your dog vaccinated is very sound. Do it! - Mod.MHJ
