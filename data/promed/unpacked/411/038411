Disease plagues pepper plantations in state
--------------------------------------------

Pepper plantations all over the state are plagued by a disease causing
the entire creeper to die. It is owing to this disease that pepper
plantations are wearing a pathetic look. The green leaves of the
pepper plant turn yellow in the first stage and the leaves fall
gradually along with the green pepper [corns].

The disease that starts in one creeper, spreads and destroys the
entire plantation. The dying of creepers can progress speedily or
gradually. In the first case, the creepers die within 15-20 days, in
the latter in one or two years.

The farmers need to chop off the creepers that spread on the ground,
and tweeze the leaves from two feet above ground. Also bordeaux
mixture [copper fungicide] should be sprayed. The disease can be
prevented from spreading by uprooting the creeper as soon as it gets
affected and burning it. Stagnant water can accelerate the disease.
The plantation has to be cared for as the disease could wipe out the
entire lot.

If the disease prevails, the future of "black gold" is in jeopardy.
Pepper is a supplementary crop that can be grown in palm plantations
with minimum expenditure and the potential to earn a higher income.

[The item above apparently reports on two or more different diseases
of the crop, with slow and fast symptom development, respectively:

Quick wilt (also called foot rot) of black pepper (_Piper nigrum_)
caused by the fungus _Phytophthora capsici_ is considered the most
serious threat to this crop in India and a yield decline of 75 percent
has been reported in some instances. It affects leaves and vines, but
once roots are affected the plant wilts and dies within a month. The
fungus is spread by splashing rain and mechanical means. It has a very
wide host range and therefore a large pathogen reservoir making it
difficult to control. Disease management includes fungicides,
biocontrol, use of disease free and resistant cultivars and cultural
practices.

Slow wilt (also called slow decline, yellows) caused by nematodes is
also present in India. Symptoms include leaf yellowing and shedding,
root degeneration, blackening of branches and eventual death of the
vine. Disease management of nematodes is difficult and includes
nematicides, use of resistant host varieties, and crop rotation with
non-host species.

In addition, two phytoplasmas have also been reported to cause
yellowing diseases on black pepper in India (see ProMED-mail post 20090112.0120). Management of phytoplasma diseases is difficult and
may include phytosanitation to reduce inoculum and insecticides to
decrease vector numbers, but use of certified clean planting material
is essential.
