104 tons of ware potatoes that arrived in the seaport of Vladivostok [Primorsky Krai] from the People's Republic of Bangladesh in May 2014 appeared to be infected with a dangerous quarantine disease -- potato brown rot (_Ralstonia solanacearum_).

The import of unsafe agricultural products has been banned: Rosselkhoznadzor (Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance) in Primorsky Krai [Primorye] and Sakhalin Region prescribed to return the infected consignment of potatoes back to the country-exporter.

The serious bacterial disease of ware potato imported into Primorsky Krai has been detected for the 4th time. The 1st 2 cases were detected in April this year [2014], when 203 tons of infected potatoes arrived in Vladivostok from India. The 3rd case was registered at the beginning of May 2014: 57 tons of potatoes arrived from Korea were infected with brown rot.

[Brown rot (also called bacterial wilt) of potato is caused by _Ralstonia solanacearum_ race 3 (biovar 2, adapted to cooler temperatures) or race 1 (prevalent in warmer areas). These pathogens can also affect tomato and other solanaceous plants. Different races and biovars cause lethal wilting diseases on more than 200 known hosts including many important crops.

Brown rot symptoms include internal staining and rotting of tubers, wilting, and death of plants, and may result in substantial yield losses. However, there may also be latent infections. The pathogens can survive in potato tubers during storage posing a high risk for introduction of the pathogen to new areas.

The bacteria are spread by mechanical means (including insects), contaminated equipment, infected plant material (including seed potatoes), soil, and water. They can survive in soil on plant debris or roots of hosts. Some weeds and unharvested potato plants may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Disease management is difficult, relying mostly on exclusion from new areas. Some cultural methods (such as crop rotation) and limited genetic resistance may be used.
