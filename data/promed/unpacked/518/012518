[In Israel, the previous HPAI H5N8 event was reported in November 2016. Since that time to Feb 2017, 33 outbreaks were reported. The event was resolved on 14 Feb 2017. See event summary and map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=21531

[In the meantime, Israel's Chief Veterinary Officer has distributed the information to stakeholders and to the poultry veterinary practitioners, calling for alertness and precautionary measures on poultry farms, since the detected case is indicative of the HPAI H5N8 presence/circulation. It was informed that the sick owl was found in Jerusalem's cemetery, brought by the finders for treatment to the Biblical Zoo's clinic where it died after being kept for several hours under isolation. - Mod.AS]

[HPAI continues to spread in Afghanistan. Since January 2108, HPAI H5 has been reported in Khost (1 case in a wild bird) and in Kabul (2 outbreaks in poultry). See posts 20180108.5545413 and 20180123.5578876, respectively. These events are still continuing. See event summaries and maps at:
Khost event: http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=25600
Kabul event:
http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=25772

For this as well as the Kabul and Khost's events, the neuraminidase has not yet been determined. There is a high likelihood that these cases are caused by HPAI H5N8 subtype. However, given that HPAI H5N6 subtypes have recently been detected in Iran (post 20180205.5608154), determining the subtype and strain of this virus is important and any information kindly requested. - Mod.CRD]
