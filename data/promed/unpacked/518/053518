Anthrax has killed hundreds of animals, mostly in the communal parts of Manicaland, within the past 2 months, and veterinary experts say the risk of the hemorrhagic infection may be greater with drought covering much of the province.

Though there were no immediate reports of human deaths in the outbreak, health authorities in Manicaland have recorded several hospitalised cases following the consumption of infected carcasses.

Dr Kurai Pride Kapondo, the acting provincial veterinary officer for Manicaland, confirmed the developments, adding that anthrax cases have frequently been documented in Buhera, Mutare, Mutasa, and Chipinge districts. The movement of cattle from these affected districts has been suspended with immediate effect, and those caught moving animals from these affected areas will be penalised because the spread of the disease is partially blamed on illegal animal movements.

Natural anthrax is endemic in Zimbabwe, where its bacillus spores can live for decades in dry soil and are ingested by animals ruminating remnants of vegetation in the driest months of September and October. Anthrax outbreaks happen occasionally in livestock herds and wild animals in Zimbabwe, usually in the Gonarezhou area. Animals typically contract the disease by ingesting or inhaling spores that can survive in soil for decades. Once infected, livestock can die within hours.

Anthrax bacteria react to drought and other harsh conditions by producing more spores, and experts said conditions are ripe for disease this year [2012]. [Drought does not encourage spore production, but it can result in more soil consumption through close grazing in risky, contaminated sites. - Mod.MHJ] A drought stretches throughout the entirety of Manicaland.

"The division of veterinary field services would like to inform the general public that there have been cases of anthrax in Manicaland province. Anthrax is a notifiable disease, and the division of veterinary services must be notified of suspected cases," said Dr Kapondo, adding that the disease presents itself as sudden death, and animals are found with tarry blood oozing from the nose, mouth and anus. "Carcasses bloat and decompose very rapidly. The carcasses of suspected anthrax cases should never be opened, and the meat should never be consumed. Should a case of anthrax occur on your farm, you may help to stop the spread of infection by burning or burying dead animals and disinfecting the place using the most effective disinfectants like quicklime, formalin or caustic soda," said Dr Kapondo.

The veterinary department is suffering from a perennial shortage of vaccines, and farmers are being encouraged to purchase their own.

[You can preach until you are blue in the face about the dangers of butchering suspect carcasses, but in rural Africa, where malnutrition can be common, the temptation is too great. Where there is extensive rural poverty, the chances of finding quick lime, formalin, or caustic soda are slim. Once, Zimbabwe/Southern Rhodesia had one of the best veterinary services in Africa. Like Kenya, they are going to need external financial aid to tackle this problem adequately.

OIE reported outbreaks in Manicaland in 1997, 2000 to 2010, and mainly in cattle; no details were available for 2011. These events, for some reason, appear to have been missed by ProMED-mail. - Mod.MHJ
