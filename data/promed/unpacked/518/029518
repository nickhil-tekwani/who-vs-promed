A mutant form of coronavirus found in Denmark has arisen previously in mink, scientists have revealed.

The mutated virus, which appears to have spread from animals to humans in Denmark, has been detected retrospectively at a mink farm in the Netherlands, according to a leading Dutch expert. The mink were culled, and the mutation did not infect humans there, he said.

A total of 6 countries have reported coronavirus outbreaks at mink farms. They include the Netherlands, Denmark, Spain, Sweden, Italy and the US.

Mink are known to be susceptible to Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, which can spread rapidly from animal to animal in mink farms.

Danish scientists believe the mutations are concerning because of their potential to make vaccines less effective. The government has ordered all farmed mink to be killed due to concerns a dozen people have been infected.

The genetic change is in a part of the Sars-CoV-2 virus known as the spike protein, which is important in immunity, and a target for some future vaccines and treatments. The Danish genome sequences were recently released on a public database, allowing scientists in other countries to look for evidence of the mutation.

Prof. Wim van der Poel, a veterinary expert at Wageningen University, said analysis of genetic data from the Netherlands revealed one previous case of the mutation at a mink farm there. He told BBC News: "We have once seen a mutant virus with a comparable mutation in the spike protein encoding region, in mink in the Netherlands, but this mutant did not spread to humans and the mink of the involved farm were culled."

The Netherlands launched a widespread cull of mink after signs, in a small number of cases, that humans had picked up coronavirus from mink.

The genetic data from Denmark was released on an international database a few days ago, with some scientists questioning why it had not been released sooner. "I think that it is most disappointing that the data have only just reached the light of day," said Prof. James Wood, head of the department of veterinary medicine at the University of Cambridge, UK. He said the genetic changes needed careful evaluation, as reports from Denmark suggested an effect on immunity. "This may be what triggered the enhanced quarantine measures for travelers from Denmark. But far more careful evaluation is urgently needed."

Mink farming required "enhanced biosecurity (or suspension) at this time", he added.

It is normal for viruses to change over time and accumulate mutations, but experts are particularly concerned when viruses pass between humans and animals. Prof. Dirk Pfeiffer, of the Royal Veterinary College in London, said while mutations in viruses happen all the time as they spread, the question is whether these change the characteristics of the virus. "At this stage, it seems to be that there may be issues with vaccine effectiveness, but this is still unclear," he said.

Effective surveillance is needed to detect emergence of new pathogens early, and then have an effective way of responding, he added.

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, an agency of the European Union, has said it will publish risk assessments on the spread of Sars-CoV-2 in mink farms this week.

It remains to be seen if the Danish mutation in the Sars-CoV-2 virus (which causes Covid-19) will be detected in other countries with mink farms. The outbreak of this mutated variant has become known as "cluster 5".

In Sweden, there have been outbreaks at mink farms in the southeast part of the country. Scientists reported that the genetic mutation found in Danish mink had not been detected so far.

[Denmark's CVO, Dr. Hanne Larsen (Danish Veterinary and Food Administration), submitted on Thu 5 Nov 2020, a (PDF, non-copyable) document titled "Update 6 on the COVID-19 situation in mink in Denmark". The update included, inter alia, the following statement: "The Danish Health Authorities have informed the ECDC, the WHO and the European Commission of the findings. The Danish authorities will provide full transparency and ensure that relevant international partners are kept updated in accordance with relevant, international health protocols.

"A general ban will not be imposed on future mink farming in Denmark, but no minks will be allowed in the cages in 2021. The government is aware that the actions now taken will entail a de facto shutdown of the Danish mink industry - at least for a number of years - but, according to the Danish health authorities, even a small number of breeding animals will pose a risk to public health". Subscribers are encouraged to visit the full text at https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/MM/Update_6_Letter_to_the_OIE_on_Sars-CoV-2_in_Denmark_5_november2020.pdf.

Notably, the most recent situation report of CVO Netherlands to OIE, submitted 6 Oct 2020 (item 1 in 20201013.7858915) included the following information: "I am in close contact with my colleague from Denmark about the situations in our respective countries and we share all the knowledge and information that is available. We organized a meeting with scientists and policy makers of both countries about the situation, and the various control measures both countries have taken".

The zoonotic aspects of the Dutch event, which had started nearly 2 months before the Danish one, were presented and discussed in a (pre-print) paper, published 1 Sep 2020 (covered in 20200902.7740793). The paper included also the following information: "Recently, a specific mutation in the spike protein (D614G) was shown to result in an increased virulence in vitro, while not associated with increased growth rate for cluster nor increased mortality. This mutation was present in farm clusters A, C, and E, but no obvious differences in clinical presentation, disease severity, or rate of transmission to humans were observed".

ECDC assessment of the Danish event, in particular its zoonotic aspects, is said to be published by 12 Nov 2020; this assessment is anticipated with great interest. - Mod.AS
