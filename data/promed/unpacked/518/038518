Jackals infected with rabies were found today [Mon 4 Dec 2017] in the Megiddo region town of Yokne'am and the Hof Carmel (Carmel Beach) region moshav of Bat Shlomo.

The Ministry of Health requests that anyone who may have been in contact with the jackals or whose animals may have come into contact should urgently contact the nearest health office or hospital emergency room to consider preventive treatment.

[This further spread of rabies westwards, crossing the entire width of the country from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean densely populated coastal area within 10 months since the start of this stormy epizootic, is a dramatic development. It may herald the virus' entrance into the Mount Carmel nature reserve and the boundaries of Haifa, Israel's third-largest city; both include rife jackal populations. Each of the recent 2 cases, in Yokne'am and Bat Shlomo, is situated less than 10 km [approx. 6 mi] from the city of Haifa, which forms part of the Haifa metropolitan area, the 2nd- or 3rd-most populous metropolitan area in Israel.

Fortunately, a high public awareness has been established and, so far, all bitten people have applied for and undergone timely post-exposure treatment by the health authorities, while many pet (dogs and cats) owners have let their animals be vaccinated or revaccinated. For an updated (4 Dec) rabies map, see http://www.moag.gov.il/vet/Yechidot/Machon/maabada_kalevet/airueim%20kalevet/Documents/mapa_kalevet_4.12.17.jpg.

Jackals and stray dogs were the predominant vectors of rabies in Israel until 1957, when their mass destruction (later criticized...) was applied and vaccination of dogs became legally compulsory. The jackals were, reportedly, replaced by foxes which became the main rabies vectors during several decades. The jackal population started recovering in the late 70's; this recovery, accompanied by their status (similar to foxes) upgraded to protected species, eventually led to a steep population growth. Oral vaccination of wild carnivores has been applied in Israel since the end of the 20's C, (see references further) but, probably, eventually falling short of effective, full coverage of the growing jackal population. Anecdotally, most of the infected jackals during 2017 have been of young age.

The following 4 references may shed some additional light on the background and recent history of rabies in Israel.

1. Anon. Rabies in jackals. Israel's Veterinary Services & Animal Health Monthly report "Yarhon", Dec 1987. p 6. [in Hebrew]

The jackal population has increased during recent years, but rabies cases among them have, so far, remained rare. No more: compared to a total of 3 lab-confirmed rabid jackals recorded during the 5 years 1982-1986, the Kimron Veterinary Institute has diagnosed 3 cases in jackals during the current year, all in the Golan (Snir, Katzrin) and Upper Galilee (Amir) regions [North-east Israel]: in February, September and October 1987.

Summary
Field trials were conducted in late April to early May of 1995 and 1996 in central Israel to assess the potential for controlling rabies in red foxes (_Vulpes vulpes_) and golden jackals (_Canis aureus_) by using vaccine-laden baits. Of the bait types which were field tested, polymer fish meal baits were selected as the most suitable for both species. Fish meal baits containing tetracycline hydrochloride, an oral biomarker, were distributed by 4-wheel-drive vehicle at a density of approx. 30 baits/km2 in 2 test areas of 35 km2. Of the animals which were trapped and euthanised 7 to 10 days after treatment, 65 percent of foxes and 56 percent of jackals gave positive results when tested for the biomarker. These results indicate the potential effectiveness of oral rabies vaccination of these species in Israel and possibly elsewhere in the Middle East, where rabies is a problem in wild canids.

Abstract
Since 1956, red foxes (_Vulpes vulpes_) and, to a lesser extent, golden jackals (_Canis aureus_), have been the primary vectors maintaining endemic wildlife rabies in Israel. Starting in the autumn of 1998, oral rabies vaccination campaigns have been conducted in Israel targeting these 2 wildlife species, with increasing yearly geographical extension. Significant data have been accumulated from an area of approximately 5200 km2 [approx. 2008 mi2] in Northern Israel. In the spring of 2003 the project was extended to 14 000 km2 [approx. 5405 mi2] and in the autumn to 21 000 km2 [approx. 8108 mi2], covering almost all inhabited areas in Israel and the West Bank. A total of 2 million RABORAL V-RG (Merial) vaccine-filled baits were distributed bi-annually by plane or helicopter at 14-19 baits per km2. Since the onset of oral vaccination activities in 1998, annual bait acceptance in the vaccination zones has been demonstrated by biomarker detection (with tetracycline) in 55 percent (429/783) of bone samples of target animals submitted for diagnosis. In 1999 to 2004, vaccine contact and induction of immunity in animals collected from the vaccination zones were reflected by seroconversion in 66 of 284 animals (23 percent). By the year 2004, rabies cases declined sharply in all progressively vaccinated areas.

The golden jackal, _Canis aureus_, and the red fox, _Vulpes vulpes_, are 2 common canids in Israel. Although the 2 species have similar diets, the jackal is about 3 times larger than the red fox. The current evidence for interspeciﬁc competition between these 2 canids is circumstantial and indirect. In this study we aimed to measure experimentally the response of red foxes to increasing exposure to the presence of the golden jackal. Our ﬁeld experiments comprised 3 stimuli: urine as a scent stimulus, a mounted specimen and urine as a static animal-image stimulus, and a caged pet animal as a live animal stimulus. The treatment and control were placed near food trays, and the behaviour of foxes around these trays was documented by video recorders. In most cases, the presence of scent or cast of a golden jackal did not alter the behaviour of the foxes. However, foxes avoided the test arena when a live jackal was present. This ﬁnding provides strong evidence that red foxes fear jackals, and shows that foxes are more concerned when a live jackal is present. The possible implications of the observed fox behaviour for the understanding of large-scale competitive exclusion among canid species are discussed.

The authors of the above (4th reference) paper were aware that their proposed hypothesis was speculative, but, being based on behavioural interactions observed between competitive canids, their conclusions on competitive exclusion of the foxes by jackals are sensible. Probably, the absence of fox rabies since 2016 (see the maps) reflects the decrease in their population.

In the previous posting on the rabies event, the (Israeli) media report was cited saying that "it has become known that the dispersion of oral vaccine baits, an activity applied annually on both sides of the Jordan River for the immunization of wild animals, has not started yet within the territory of the Kingdom of Jordan, on the eastern side of the Jordan River. The reasons for this are unclear, but Walla! News has noted that this may be due to the crisis in relations between the 2 countries following the incident at the Amman embassy last July [2017]". In response, Mod. SMA, who is well-acquainted with Jordan's actual situation, kindly noted that "oral vaccine baits have not been used for a while to prevent rabies in Jordan, and this has nothing to do with the incident at the Amman embassy last July 2017". He added that "Animal Birth Control (ABC) programs are done sporadically and led by Amman municipality to reduce the numbers of stray dogs. Some Governorates still kill stray dogs by shooting to reduce their numbers, because of incidences of stray dogs attack on humans".

Israel's media has been following the evolving local rabies event intensively; have parallel echoes been published in the Jordanian press? Jordan reported a single human rabies case in each of the years 2012, 2014 and 2016. Information on the current rabies situation there, particularly in wildlife, will be useful. - Mod.AS]
