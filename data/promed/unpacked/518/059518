I'm going to "diagnose" this as "poacher-itis": a zoonotic condition, whose
etiology goes something like this. Poacher and assistant enter the waters
at night in a sturdy boat. Assistant uses a high-intensity light to locate
the reflective eyes of alligators, swimming near surface. When eyes are
located, poacher fires a small caliber rifle, aiming for the space between
the eyes. The ailment is often fatal, but under some circumstances the
bullet disintegrates before reaching the brain, but damages the optic nerve
bundles somewhat. Secondary infection and parasitic intrusion do the rest.
