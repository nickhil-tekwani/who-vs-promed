Follow-up report No. 1 at <http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/aIS_56.htm#Sec5>
Follow-up report No. 2 at <http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_55.HTM#Sec8>
Information received on 10 March 2004 from Dr Brian Evans, Executive
Director, Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), Ottawa:
On-going tests performed by the CFIA indicate a differentiation in the
pathogencity of the virus recovered from the 2 units on the premises:
- The virus recovered from the flock of 52-week-old birds was confirmed as
low pathogenicity (intravenous pathogenicity index = 0.0).
- Additional work on samples derived from the flock of 24-week-old birds
also returned an H7N3 subtype with a similar nucleotide sequence at the
cleavage site. However, pathogenicity determinations now completed have
revealed both low pathogenic and high pathogenic strains (intravenous
pathogenicity index = 3.0) to be present within this group of birds.
Control measures during reporting period: depopulation and disposal of the
flock has been completed and ring surveillance continues.
