3rd county ranch has deadly poultry virus; 69 000 birds must be destroyed
at new site
------------------------
The county's poultry ranchers have been fiercely guarding their birds
against a fatal avian virus for months, but officials announced yesterday a
third commercial ranch had been infected with exotic Newcastle disease.

About 69 000 birds will be destroyed at the site of the newest outbreak.
The ranch is close to a Valley Center ranch owned by Armstrong Farms that
tested positive for the virus last week, sources said. But officials with
the state and federal Exotic Newcastle Disease Task Force, following a
long-standing policy, would not disclose its name or location.

At the Armstrong ranch, on Cole Grade Road, state and federal workers
wearing white disposable suits went about the process of euthanizing its
150 000 birds yesterday.

Ranch owner Alan Armstrong, like other ranchers in the county and
elsewhere, had been following strict bio-security measures since the
outbreak of exotic Newcastle was confirmed in a backyard flock of chickens
in Los Angeles County in October 2002. But it seems that even the most
careful security is no guarantee the virus won't somehow creep onto a ranch.

"It's just that constant threat. It's so nerve-wracking," said Frank
Hilliker of Hilliker Egg Ranch, which has about 30 000 birds in
Lakeside. "Every time the federal people come and the state people come to
take some birds to the lab, the anxiety goes up," Hilliker said of the
weekly testing by the task force. It is done at each commercial ranch in a
quarantine zone covering 8 Southern California counties and 2 counties in
Arizona and Nevada.

Commercial ranches have reduced the traffic onto their ranches, allowing
access only to those people who must be there, such as task force members
and ranch workers. Every truck is disinfected, as are visitors' shoes.

The Fluegge Egg Ranches maintain about 60 000 chickens at a ranch in Valley
Center and about 95 000 at an Escondido facility. August Fluegge Jr., who
owns the ranch with his father, August Sr., said he spends about $50 a week
on disinfectant. But the bigger burden is the extra labor, Fluegge said.
"Every time a truck comes in, we spray it, and we spray all our racks," he
said. "What really costs is all the time to do everything."

The disease, which is harmless to humans, appeared in San Diego County late
in December 2002, when it was detected in a flock of 73 000 chickens at
Ramona Egg Enterprises in Ramona.

There have also been 3 cases of exotic Newcastle in backyard flocks of
birds in the county.

The outbreak is the worst since exotic Newcastle last spread through
commercial chicken ranches in the 1970s, when it took officials 3 years to
eradicate the disease. About 12 million birds were destroyed and $56
million spent on the effort before the outbreak was contained.

The current outbreak has already cost the state and federal governments
about $35 million. The disease's spread has prompted authorities to order
the destruction of 2.6 million birds, and the task force has pleaded with
bird owners to follow safety precautions such as keeping pet birds isolated
from other birds.

Information on safety precautions can be found on the California Department
of Food and Agriculture's Web site:

A fourth round in a series of aerial treatments of pesticide in a
28-square-mile core area of the quarantine zone was scheduled for last night.

The quarantine requires growers to repeatedly treat their crops with a
pesticide-laced bait before they can pick and ship any fruit.
