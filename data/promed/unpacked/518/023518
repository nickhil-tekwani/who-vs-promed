Southern and central Italian livestock farms have been hit hard by a wave of over 1300 bluetongue cases this month [October 2014], resulting in 459 sheep deaths. Italy's national laboratory has been inundated with reports from across Italy's southern half, particularly in Tuscany, Umbria, Abruzzo, Campania and Calabria.

Cases have been confirmed in sheep, cattle, goats, and 5 buffaloes by the Experimental Zooprophylactic Institute. It is now over a year since the virus ­- serotype 1 -­ was confirmed in a holding on the west coast of Lazio, according to World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) records. Vaccinations, screening, zoning, and movement controls are in force.

[Italy has been experiencing a major BTV-1 epizootic since late September 2013. This event is unrelated to the BTV-4 epizootic which has been spreading in the Balkans and other adjacent countries since April 2014.

So far, 181 outbreaks have been reported, covering central and southern Italy. For an interactive map showing all outbreaks and links to the 24 reports submitted so far to the OIE, please go to

According to Italy's information as submitted to the OIE, vaccination had not been practiced prior to the outbreak but is being applied "in response to the outbreak." Details of this vaccination, including number of vaccinated animals and their locations/species, will be appreciated.

Remarkably, this epizootic is restricted to the continental parts of Italy and has not been recorded in Sicily and Sardinia. According to Italy's last presentation to EU's SCFCAH on its bluetongue situation, submitted in January 2014, Sardinia's cattle (26 543 head) sheep (819 489) and goats (7727) have been vaccinated during 2013 against BTV serotypes 1 and 8; the presentation is available at
