A 4-year-old New Haven girl who contracted [an] eastern equine
encephalitis [EEE] [virus infection] died Sunday morning [14 Aug 2011]
at Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital in Syracuse. She is the 5th
person in 40 years to die from the EEE virus in New York state. All 5
deaths were in Central New York. The girl's symptoms began earlier
this month [August 2011] and she was admitted to the hospital, a
family friend said. Doctors last week determined the girl had been
infected by the EEE virus.

Oswego County Health Department officials Sunday [14 Aug 2011]
declined to identify the child infected by the EEE virus or confirm
that she had died.

There is no specific treatment for EEE, nor is there a human vaccine.
