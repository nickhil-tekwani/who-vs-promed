A West Nile virus (WNV) case has been confirmed in a horse in Clarke County. The affected horse--a vaccinated 8-year-old Holsteiner stallion--developed mild ataxia, prominent skin twitching, and moderate behavioral anxiety. He has since fully recovered.

The Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported on [1 Nov 2018] that the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS) confirmed another case of equine WNV. This is the 7th case of WNV in Virginia horses confirmed so far this year [2018], according to USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) data.

The affected horse--a vaccinated 8-year-old Holsteiner stallion from Clarke County--, developed mild ataxia (incoordination), prominent skin twitching, and moderate behavioral anxiety on [13 Oct 2018], the EDCC said. A serum sample was positive on the IgM Capture ELISA performed at the Cornell University Animal Health Diagnostic Center, in Ithaca, New York. The affected horse has fully recovered, the EDCC said.

In 2017 there was just one confirmed case of WNV in Virginia horses, according to APHIS data.

The Georgia Department of Agriculture has reported the state's first West Nile virus (WNV) cases of the year [2018], the Equine Disease Communication Center said on [2 Nov 2018]. They've confirmed 3 cases of WNV in Georgia horses.

The WNV-positive horses were located in Brooks, Franklin, and Hart counties.

In 2017, officials confirmed 11 cases of WNV in Georgia horses, according to USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service data.

The Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) announced on [31 Oct 2018] that the Oklahoma Department of Agriculture, Food, and Forestry (ODAFF) has reported 6 confirmed cases of equine West Nile virus (WNV). This brings the total to 11 confirmed cases of WNV in Oklahoma horses so far this year [2018]

The EDCC and ODAFF said:

- "A 3-year-old Quarter Horse filly from in Bryan County was showing severe neurologic signs and was euthanized. Her vaccination history is unknown;

- An unvaccinated yearling Quarter Horse colt located in Garvin County was showing moderate neurologic signs;

- "A 12-year-old Warmblood gelding in Payne County was showing severe neurologic signs and was euthanized. The horse was current on vaccinations;

- "A 2-year-old Quarter Horse gelding from in Osage County was showing severe neurologic signs and died within 24 hours. The vaccination history is unknown;

- "A 3-year-old Clydesdale/Hackney located in Grady County was showing mild neurologic signs. The horse was currently vaccinated against WNV, and;

- "An unvaccinated 2-year-old Quarter horse filly from Logan County was showing severe neurologic signs but is improving with treatment."

In 2017 there were 7 confirmed cases of WNV in Oklahoma horses, according to USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service data.

WNV is transmitted to horses via bites from infected mosquitoes. Not all infected horses show clinical signs, but those that do can exhibit:

- Flulike signs, where the horse seems mildly anorexic and depressed;
- Fine and coarse muscle and skin fasciculation (involuntary twitching);
- Hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound);
- Changes in mentation (mentality), when horses look like they're daydreaming or "just not with it";
- Occasional drowsiness;
- Propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control); and
- Spinal signs, including asymmetrical weakness; and
- Asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia (incoordination).

WNV has no cure; however, some horses can recover with supportive care. Equine mortality rates can reach 30-40%. Studies have shown that vaccines can be effective WNV prevention tools. Horses vaccinated in past years need an annual booster shot, but veterinarians might recommend 2 boosters annually--one in the spring and another in the fall--in areas with prolonged mosquito seasons. In contrast, previously unvaccinated horses require a 2-shot vaccination series in a 3- to 6-week period. It takes several weeks for horses to develop protection against the disease following complete vaccination or booster administration. In addition to vaccinations, owners should work to reduce mosquito population and breeding areas and limit horses' mosquito exposure by:

- Removing stagnant water sources;
- Dumping, cleaning, and refilling water buckets and troughs regularly;
- Keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times (typically early in the morning and evening); and
- Applying mosquito repellents approved for equine use.

[There are so many areas with horses suffering from a preventable disease. If people won't, cannot or don't choose to vaccinate, then I hope winter weather will come quickly and kill the mosquitoes capable of transmitting this virus.

Vaccination is the best prevention of West Nile virus and coincidentally of the expense of treating your animal and/or the heartbreak of losing your animal. - Mod.TG
