[Losing 9 animals to acute anthrax suggests that the owner was unaware of what was happening as normally dead cows are reported as soon as the first case occurs. And with 9 sick and dead animals there would have been plenty of blood sources for female haemorrphagic flies. An investigation of this event will probably reveal subsequent cases in neighbouring herds, and maybe a previous case in the area.

Past outbreaks were reported in Lazio in cattle in 1997 and 2000, and in sheep in 2016 and 2005. - Mod.MHJ
