Re: the report on EEE in horses and emus in Alabama and Florida and the
moderator's (CHC) accompanying remarks:
(1) The discourteous and disparaging remarks on the part of the moderator
with reference to this wire story are inappropriate and add nothing to the
informational content of the posted message. In fact it is remarks like
these -- including ones that are presumably intended to be "cute" -- that
the moderator, of all people, should be discouraging. If the moderator
wanted to know what mosquito surveillance activities are being conducted in
Alabama relative to mosquito-borne viruses, he should have contacted the
Alabama Department of Public Health. Had he done so, he would have learned
that the Mobile County Health Department has been monitoring sentinel
chickens all spring and summer for EEE activity, as they have done in south
Alabama on an annual basis for many years.
(2) Regarding the breeding sites of vectors of EEE virus, the moderator
should have clarified what the breeding sites of the vectors are, rather
than making a snide remark that added no information for the interested
reader.
(3) Although the closing "Question" was no doubt intended to be humorous, it
is
inappropriate for ProMED, or any other such service that is supposed to be
moderated to maintain professional credibility and decorum.

[There is a Chinese proverb which says, "In multitudes of words, surely some
mistakes." Not only were Mobile County Health Department personnel trained
in my laboratory when I was at CDC, but my grandmother and mother were born
in Mobile and Hank Aaaron played there at one time, so I am familiar with
what's what in that port city. What I was trying to say, poorly as it
turned out, was that it would have been better to have information directly
from the source. That is always the case. For the most part, ProMED-mail
is at the mercy of our subscribers to provide information. Unless we have
data we cannot post data, so we rely on media reports to get the pot
stirred.
The natural cycle of EEE virus in North America includes _Culiseta melanura_
mosquitoes, which feed almost exclusively on birds. These mosquitoes are,
therefore, not the likely transmitters of EEEV to horses and humans. It is
_Aedes_ sp. and _Coquilletidia_ sp. mosquitoes that pick up the virus from
birds and transmit it to horses and humans. Thus control of EEEV must
include source reduction, larviciding and adulticiding of _Cs. melanura_,
[and might better place the onus of responsibility on prevention rather
than on the victims.
Rather than tell us we are disparaging, how about sending us information?
Seems like a better solution to me. It might also be better if someone more
knowledgeable than I would [e-mail us to clarify the breeding sites and
proclivities of EEEV vectors?
As for my poor attempt at humor, let me just say that (a) a joke is not a
joke unless it is funny, and (b) I try to not take too much seriously,
certainly not myself. If you didn't like that one, how about: (Woody
Allen): "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work, I want to
achieve it by not dying." - Mod CHC
[We are still in the dark as to what the sentinel chicken surveillance
showed, and whether it gave any advance warning before the horse & emu cases
appeared - Mod.JW
