Exotic Newcastle Disease detected in another San Diego County flock
----------------------
Exotic Newcastle disease has been found in another commercial chicken flock
in San Diego County, bringing the total of contaminated operations in
Southern California to 17.

More than 2.1 million birds have destroyed since the disease was first
detected in the fall of 2002 in backyard poultry and pet birds in Los
Angeles County. The disease has spread to Orange, Riverside, San
Bernardino, and San Diego counties, prompting a broad quarantine.

Gov. Gray Davis declared a state of emergency last month, releasing money
and manpower to combat the disease. Humans are not affected by the disease.

California is the nation's fifth-largest egg producer. About half of the 6
billion eggs produced each year in California come from San Diego and
Riverside counties.

The disease so far has been detected in 5 San Diego County flocks.

The last time Exotic Newscastle disease broke out in California was in the
1970s, when 12 million birds had to be destroyed at a cost of $56 million.

The disease spreads quickly among birds. Signs of the disease in birds
include sneezing, coughing, gasping for air, drooping wings, muscular
tremors, and paralysis.

The death tally reached 3 million Tuesday in Southern California, where the
poultry industry continues to be ravaged by exotic Newcastle disease.

The Exotic Newcastle Disease Task Force said Tuesday that the virus has
infected a flock of 55 000 chickens in San Diego County. It's the fifth
commercial flock in the county and the 17th in Southern California to be
infected.

Like the others before them, the infected birds will be destroyed, their
bodies double-bagged and the remains buried.

All 8 Southern California counties are under quarantine, forbidding the
movement of live birds or poultry products out of the zone without a permit
certifying they are free of the disease.

Regions of Nevada and Arizona, where the disease has been discovered in
backyard flocks, are under a similar quarantine.

Newcastle does not affect humans, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said,
nor does it damage meat or eggs. The exotic strain, however, is fatal to birds.

The disease has not been found in the Central Valley, where
Livingston-based Foster Poultry Farms raises many of its birds. Foster
Poultry Farms accounts for more than 90 percent of the state's chicken
production and is the No. 7 processor in the country, according to industry
production figures.

California's poultry industry is worth $3.2 billion annually, according to
the Modesto-based California Poultry Federation.

The task force last week announced a program to monitor the valley, Sierra
foothills and North Coast for the disease. The program will be based in
Modesto and will go door to door, with teams asking about birds and
providing information about the disease. The surveys will start in March
[2003].

On a related note, Napa County sheriff's deputies raided an alleged
cockfighting operation, according to the California Farm Bureau Federation.
They confiscated more than 1000 roosters, as well as fighting equipment.

Government and industry officials are worried that cockfighting -- illegal
in California and 47 other states -- could be spreading Newcastle in
Southern California and could eventually bring it to the Central Valley.

A statewide outbreak of the disease in the 1970s led officials to destroy
nearly 12 million chickens. That outbreak cost $56 million to stop and it
was found that illegal cockfighting played a role in the spread of the disease.

The federal government has spent $22 million and the state $13 million
battling the latest outbreak, according to the state.
