Haywood County health director Patrick Johnson recently confirmed that 2 residents of Haywood County have been diagnosed with La Crosse encephalitis virus (LACV). The patients, one of whom required a hospital stay, are recovering well at home. "This is an unfortunate reminder that all residents in our community need to take precautions to reduce exposure to mosquitos and prevent mosquito bites," said Johnson.

The mosquitoes that spread LACV are most active during the daytime. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), "the best way to reduce your risk of infection with LACV or other mosquitoborne viruses is to use insect repellent (containing DEET, picaridin, IR3535); wear long sleeves, long pants, and socks; or stay indoors while mosquitoes are most active."

Mosquitoes can lay eggs even in small amounts of standing water. "It is critical to get rid of mosquito breeding sites," says Johnson. Some suggestions include emptying standing water from flowerpots, buckets, barrels, and tires. Change the water in pet dishes and replace the water in bird baths often.

LACV is maintained in a cycle between _Aedes triseriatus_ (the eastern treehole mosquito) and vertebrate hosts in deciduous forest habitats (i.e., forests with trees that lose their leaves each year). [The virus is maintained in populations of these mosquitoes through transovarial transmission that passes the virus from one generation of mosquitoes to the next. Vertebrate hosts can serve as amplifiers of the virus and move the virus from one nearby locality to the next. - Mod.TY] Humans can become infected with LACV from the bite of an infected mosquito. However, humans rarely, if ever, develop high enough concentrations of LACV in their bloodstreams to infect feeding mosquitoes. Humans are therefore considered incidental hosts for LACV.

According to CDC, "approximately 80-100 cases of LACV are reported each year in the United States, and most occur in children under 16 years of age." Many people infected with LACV have no apparent symptoms. Those who become ill, usually within 5-15 days of exposure, may experience fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. Some of those who become ill will develop severe neuroinvasive disease (disease that affects the nervous system), which often involves encephalitis (an inflammation of the brain) and can include seizures, coma, paralysis, and, in rare cases, long-term disability or death. There is no specific antiviral treatment for LACV infection. Most often, people are hospitalized, and care is based on symptom management. "Awareness, education, and prevention are key," says Johnson.

If you or a family member has symptoms of LACV disease or any symptoms causing you concern, promptly consult a healthcare provider for proper diagnosis.

[This report does not indicate the age of the 2 infected individuals. Serious cases with encephalitis occur mainly in young children. Although the case fatality rate is low, there can be neurological sequelae in survivors.

Haywood County is within the endemic La Crosse virus area, and cases occur there sporadically (see La Crosse encephalitis - USA (03): (NC) 20181019.6101400). The elimination of potential _Ochlerotatus (Aedes) triseriatus_ breeding sites is well advised, especially elimination of used-tire dumps. However, these mosquitoes also breed in the water that accumulates in basal tree holes. These sites are often difficult to detect and then eliminate. These mosquitoes bite during daylight hours. Avoidance of mosquito bites is the best preventive measure.

As noted earlier, La Crosse encephalitis virus (LACV) is a member of the California serogroup of arboviruses. A map of the distribution of California virus serogroup neuroinvasive disease cases (mainly LACV cases) shows 3 major focal geographic areas: (1) in the unglaciated areas of southeastern Minnesota/southwestern Wisconsin/northwestern Illinois, (2) Ohio, where a previous case occurred this year (2018), and (3) the central Appalachian Mountain areas of Virginia/West Virginia and North Carolina/Tennessee (see the CDC map at http://www.cdc.gov/lac/tech/epi.html). Severe neurological cases occur mainly in preschool-age children, although adults may also develop encephalitis, as in this case. Encephalitis is seldom fatal, but prolonged hospitalization and sequelae, including personality changes, may occur.

Cases may occur earlier in the summer season than other arthropod-borne viruses, because the virus can be transovarially transmitted by the infected female to her eggs, so emerging adults may already be infected and ready to transmit the virus without the need to take an infectious blood meal from an infected forest mammal. The Asian tiger mosquito, _Ae. albopictus_, can also transmit the virus.

The CDC has a good summary of LACV and its epidemiology, geographic distribution, and clinical characteristics at https://www.cdc.gov/lac/tech/epi.html.
