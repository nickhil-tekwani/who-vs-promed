Re: West Nile virus: some horses need booster: CORRECTION
---------------------------------------------------------
In a recent ProMED-mail posting of a media release from the Texas Animal
Health Commission, it was stated that "WNV vaccine is produced by Fort
Dodge Animal Health and is conditionally licensed by the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA), explained veterinarian Terry Conger, TAHC's state
epidemiologist."
In fact, veterinary vaccines, diagnostic kits, and other veterinary
biologics are regulated by the USDA's Center for Veterinary Biologics,
Ames, Iowa. These products are regulated by the United States Department of
Agriculture (USDA) under the regulations developed to support the
Virus-Serum-Toxin Act of 1913,as amended in 1985."

West Nile virus latest news - as of Wed 13 Nov 2002
---------------------------------------------------
In 2002 West Nile virus (WNV) has been detected in 43 states across the US
and 5 provinces in Canada, from Saskatchewan to Nova Scotia. In the US the
only states where it has not been detected are Alaska, Arizona (several
cases imported from elsewhere), Hawaii, Idaho (though detected in a raven
in a bordering county in Washington), Nevada, Oregon (human case contracted
elsewhere), and Utah. In many states WNV has been detected in all, or
nearly all, counties, including several on the Mexican border.
As of Wed 13 Nov 2002, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
reports 3587 human cases (211 fatalities) in 39 states and Washington DC.
During the week 24 to 30 Oct 2002, 123 new lab-positive human cases were
reported (less than half the number reported the previous week, 10 to 16
Oct 2002. The number of human cases and fatalities continues to increase,
while the rate of increase has slowed considerably. Largest numbers of new
cases are in Indiana (43), while the largest number of cases in 2002 are in
Illinois (719), Michigan (472), Ohio (385), Louisiana (317), Indiana (247),
Mississippi (182), Missouri (162), Texas (140), and Nebraska (115).
Sirrus, a 12 year old harbor seal at the New Jersey State Aquarium, is
recently confirmed to have died on 22 Sep 2002 from WNV infection (disease
onset 12 Sep 2002), the first confirmation of a marine mammal dying from
WNV in the US. The seal had no health problems after living in the
saltwater exhibit for 10 years and how he became infected is unclear. Test
results are also pending on the cause of the 2 Sep 2002 death of a 23 year
old gray seal at the National Zoo in Washington DC.
Equine cases are up to 11 957 in 38 states, as reported to USDA APHIS by
state health officials as of 27 Oct 2002. This is an increase of 431 cases
from one week ago. Nebraska and Iowa each have more than 1000 cases, and
Illinois and Texas have nearly as many. In Texas the 817 cases represent
about 0.1 per cent of the million horses in the state. WNV has now been
associated with illness and death in several other mammal species including
reindeer, mountain goats, and squirrels.
