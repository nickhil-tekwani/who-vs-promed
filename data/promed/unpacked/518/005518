[The outbreaks in Tunisia are caused by the serotype BTV-1, which
caused the outbreaks earlier in the year in Algeria and also earlier
this month in Morocco. Vaccination of highly valued stock should be
considered. BTV-1 has also recently been seen in the Eastern
Mediterranean in Lesbos, Greece and in Oman. See comments of Mod.AS
in ProMED-mail posting No. 20090916.3249. - Mods.FE/PC]
