[African Horse Sickness is a devastating disease of horses
characterized by different syndromes. For a brief overview see
United States Animal Health Association description in the "Gray
Book" - see <http://www.vet.uga.edu/VPP/gray_book/FAD/AHS.htm> or
Mod. TG's excellent commentary in the Mpumalanga outbreak posting
referenced below.
In my few encounters with the disease, I was struck by the extreme
respiratory distress including froth pouring from the nostrils,
extensive hydrothorax and hydropericaridium, supraorbital edema and a
gelatinous infiltration of subcutaneous tissue and intermuscular
fascial planes along the ligamentum nuchae and muscles of the
shoulder.
In 2004, South Africa reported 196 outbreaks resulting in 335 cases
and 166 deaths. The case fatality rate was even higher in 2003, with
89 outbreaks resulting in 510 cases and 441 deaths. Prior to this
outbreak, the Western Cape province had been declared an AHS-free
zone from which horses could be exported. - Mod.PC]
