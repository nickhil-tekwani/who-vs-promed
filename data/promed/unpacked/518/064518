[The OIE diagnostic manual at
<http://www.oie.int/eng/normes/fmanual/A_00048.htm>
gives the following summary, which I have edited for the sake of brevity:
White spot disease (WSD) of _penaeid_ shrimp is characterized by high
and rapid mortality accompanied by gross signs in moribund shrimp of
white, initially circular, inclusions or spots in the cuticle,
sometimes accompanied by overall red body coloration. Rapid and
severe pond mortality follows shortly after the 1st appearance of
gross signs.
The causative agent of WSD is white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) or
white spot virus (WSV), a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) virus of the
genus _Whispovirus_ within the family _Nimaviridea_. WSSV has a wide
host range among crustaceans and is potentially lethal to most of the
commercially cultivated _penaeid_ shrimp species.
Although this report contains much information for a preliminary
report, further details will be interesting. - Mod.PC]
