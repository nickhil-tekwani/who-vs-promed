MENINGOCOCCUS GROUP C VACCINE - UK: CORRECTION

In [an earlier ProMED-mail posting cited above it was erroneously reported
that the meningococcal conjugate manufactured by Wyeth-Lederle has been
licensed in the U.S. Please note that the meningococcal type C conjugate
vaccine manufactured by Wyeth-Lederle, currently being used in the U.K., is
NOT licensed in the U.S. The correspondent apparently has confused the
meningococcal C conjugate vaccine with a 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate
vaccine, Prevnar, also manufactured by Wyeth-Lederle. The meningococcal C
conjugate vaccine served as a control for Prevnar in the definitive
efficacy trial, however, the preventive efficacy of the meningococcal C
vaccine was not evaluated. Prevnar was shown to be highly efficacious in
preventing invasive pneumococcal disease, and was licensed 17 Feb 2000 in
the US for use in infants and toddlers.

[Thanks to Dr. Pratt for setting the record straight concerning
meningococcal type C conjugate vaccines in the US. It is noteworthy that
there is a licensed quadrivalent capsular polysaccharide vaccine available
in the US that provided coverage for type C disease. Dr. Pratt was also
kind enough to provide a URL for a transcript of a public meeting conducted
during September of 1999 at which the epidemiology of meningococcal disease
for the US vs. Europe and technical issues related to evaluation of
conjugate meningococcal vaccines were discussed at length. This is a very
long document, but those with a special interest may find it at:
