One anthrax case in Tavush region
---------------------------------
In Ijevan, Tavush region, an animal infected with anthrax was detected, the chief veterinarian of Tavush region told Aysor.am today.

He informed that they have been forced to slaughter the animal and to bury it after which they have disinfected the [soil]. The [clinical] signs and temperature [were the reasons for than animal's forced slaughter].

At present, as the chief veterinarian of Tavush region informs, they are examining the region, though there are no new suspicious cases.

[There is no mention of any laboratory confirmation, nor of checking stained blood smears for capsulated organisms. So this can only be "suspect" until there is some hard information. Quite possibly there is some unstated information of other cases in the village which has swayed the Chief Veterinarian's convictions. We look forward to any information concerning confirmation.

It always puzzles me why some countries insist on slaughtering clinical bovine cases of anthrax. Actually they respond well to last minute antibiotic treatment. Even if they die, it is worth it as the antibiotic will have killed the organism which will stop subsequent contamination with spores. The only reason I can see for killing clinical cases is to prevent the owner butchering the moribund animals after the veterinarian has left the farm. In many eastern countries it is forbidden to butcher and eat animals which had died. - Mod.MHJ]
