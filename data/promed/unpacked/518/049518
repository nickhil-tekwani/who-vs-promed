5th Marion County horse dies of EEE
-----------------------------------
A Dunnellon area horse has died of eastern equine encephalitis, according
to the Marion County Health Department. It was the 5th horse in the area to
die of the mosquitoborne illness, which is usually fatal to horses and can
be fatal to humans.

In horses, the disease presents itself as a general lethargy and
depression-like signs. Occasionally vaccinated horses die of the disease.
[This is because the protective titer against this disease is very short
lived and requires frequent re-vaccination. - Mod.TG]

[Mosquitoes can transmit this disease to horses and to humans. While humans
can take protective measures, such as avoiding the most likely mosquito
times, such as dusk and dawn, wearing long sleeves, wearing mosquito
repellant, and preventing standing water which is a breeding site for
mosquitoes.

We continually hold out hope that people will vaccinate their horses at
least every 4-6 months to protect them from this disease. - Mod.TG
