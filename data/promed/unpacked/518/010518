[Usually, unless serious efforts in the direction of local and region
eradication are made, countries that have FMD will have outbreaks on
a regular basis. But this does not seem to be the case for the FMD
reported here. Namibia, Zambia, Botswana and Zimbabwe have all
reported the disease on a regular basis during this time frame.

The outbreak location is in the southeast corner of the country near
the sliver of land [Caprivi Strip] protruding east from Namibia's
northeast corner. It is also very close to the Zambian border and just
across the Strip from Botswana. The location can be seen on the map
included in the OIE/WAHID report at the source URL above - Mod.PC

Note that Angola delayed for 3 months before submitting this report to
OIE. Given the proximity to those 3 infected countries, it is
remarkable that Angola has not reported a single FMD outbreak to OIE
since 1974. - Mod.JW/Copy-ed.MJ]
