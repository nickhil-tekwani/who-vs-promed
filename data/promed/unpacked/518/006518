Sweden's first death caused by EHEC has now been reported. An 18 month old
boy died on July 12 in hospital. A post mortem revealed the presence of
Shigatoxin in his faeces. The source of infection is not yet established
and no associated cases have been reported.
The first real outbreak of EHEC in Sweden occurred in 1995 with a total of
114 cases. This increased to 118 cases in 1996 and 150 reported cases in
1997. Sources identified have been contact with animals and swimming and
outbreaks have been fairly localised to a few specific areas. The Swedish
Board of Agriculture for this summer recommended specific precautions to be
undertaken when children are visiting farm animals. The National Food
Administration last year introduced a penalty system for delivery of dirty
livestock to abattoirs. The two newspapers Expressen and Aftonbladet today
released everyday hygienic measures for the kitchen to prevent further
outbreaks covering hand washing, cooking and the separation of raw and
cooked product.
