[It is unusual to see outbreaks in this northern region of Kazakhstan on the border with Russia. Guessing, I would speculate that the recent eccentric outbreaks outside the normally affected oblasts has stimulated an increased awareness resulting in this case being observed and reported. They do state that there was an outbreak thereabouts in 2010. Hopefully the vaccination response will discourage further outbreaks. - Mod.MHJ
