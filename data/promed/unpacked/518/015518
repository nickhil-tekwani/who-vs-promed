EU Animal disease notification system (ADNS)
-----------------------------------------------
According to the most current weekly update of table 11 (animal
disease situation per country and per disease; distributed 6 Nov
2006), the total number of confirmed bluetongue outbreaks reported by
European Union member states during the period 1 Jan 2006 to 3 Nov
2006 was 1475.
The following number of summarized confirmed 2006 outbreaks are
retrieved from last week's and the 3 previous weekly ADNS reports:
Country / 3 Nov / 27 Oct / 20 Oct / 13 Oct / last date of confirmation
1. Belgium / 490 / 460 / 403 / 297 / 30 Oct 2006
2. Germany / 592 / 472 / 365 / 208 / 2 Nov 2006
3. France / 5 / 5 / 5 / 4 / 13 Oct 2006
4. Netherlands / 359 / 317 / 263 / 206 / 2 Nov 2006
5. Bulgaria / 8 / 8 / 8 / 0 / 11 Oct 2006
6. Italy / 21 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 1 Nov 2006

[Regarding the northwestern European countries reportedly infected by
BTV-8, it seems that, in spite of the declining temperatures, the
disease has not phased-out yet in Belgium, Germany or the
Netherlands. Taking into consideration the BT disease incubation time
in livestock (usually 5 - 10 days), the climatic conditions which
prevailed approx 2 weeks earlier, which affected the vector, are
those relevant to the disease statistics, and not the climatic
conditions at the time of diagnosis or reporting.
Have climatic conditions been the only factor in the extension of
this epizootic into the late north-European October, or is it also
related to the disposition of the recently identified vector,
_Culicoides dewulfi_? (see 20061024.3042). Research into the matter
is needed to assess disease evolution in future years.
As is apparent from the following data, the disease, though still
active, seems to have peaked in Belgium and the Netherlands. In
Germany, the picture is morevequivocal.
Country: new outbreaks in week ending 13 Oct / 20 Oct / 27 Oct / 3 Nov 2006
Belgium: 96 / 106 / 57 / 30
Netherlands: 60 / 57 / 54 / 42
Germany: 58 / 157 / 107 / 120
A bluetongue distribution map, updated 3 Nov 2006, is available at
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/notifiable/pdf/bt-europemap.pdf>.
The map also shows the "outbreak" in Poland, reflecting last week's
serologically-detected cases in imported cows; this event is not yet
presented in the ADNS update.
The new outbreaks in southern Europe -- Bulgaria and Italy (Sardinia)
-- seem unrelated to the north-European event. The new, serious
outbreak in Sardinia has, reportedly, been caused by BTV-1, most
probably arriving with infected culicoides from North Africa. The
typing is pending of the BTV that has given rise to the
serologically-positive reactions, on 10 Oct 2006, in Bulgarian
sentinel goats adjacent to the Turkish border (see 20061026.3060). - Mod.AS]
