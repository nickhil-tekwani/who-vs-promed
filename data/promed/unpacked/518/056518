Today [21 Sep 2021] the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) released its latest numbers on how many American children are being infected with COVID-19 and said nearly 226 000 child COVID-19 cases were reported from 9 to 16 Sep 2021, the 3rd highest number of child cases in a week since the pandemic began. Children represented 25.7% of the weekly reported cases.

"After declining in early summer, child cases have increased exponentially, with over 925 000 cases in the past 4 weeks," the AAP said. In total, roughly 5.5 million US children have been infected with COVID-19 since the pandemic began.

Though severe illness is very rare, the AAP warned, "There is an urgent need to collect more data on longer-term impacts of the pandemic on children, including ways the virus may harm the long-term physical health of infected children, as well as its emotional and mental health effects."

Yesterday [20 Sep 2021], the United States reported 201 648 new COVID-19 cases and 2302 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker. In total, the United States has confirmed 42 341 134 COVID-19 cases, including 677 261 deaths (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/cumulative-cases).

As of Monday [20 Sep 2021], roughly the same number of Americans have now died from COVID-19 as the number who died during the 1918-1919 flu pandemic, the Washington Post reports. But the population was one-third of the current population in 1918, which means the flu was felt more acutely (https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/09/21/covid-delta-variant-live-updates/).

Despite the wide availability of vaccines that cut the risk of death from COVID-19 significantly, September may be the deadliest month in the pandemic since February [2021], according to a USA Today analysis of Johns Hopkins data (https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/09/20/covid-vaccine-mandate-mask-deaths-cases-biden/8413057002/).

As of this weekend, the United States reported 32 666 deaths in September [2021] compared with 27 755 in all of August, with many states reporting double the number of deaths compared to August. In Minnesota, 757 patients are now hospitalized due to COVID-19, the highest figure for 2021, according to the StarTribune (https://www.startribune.com/covid-19-hospitalizations-reach-757-in-minnesota-highest-in-2021/600099069/).

Travel restrictions include proof of vaccination
------------------------------------------------
The Biden administration will require foreign nationals seeking to fly to the United States to show proof of vaccination, the Wall Street Journal reports. The new policy, which will take effect in November [2021], replaces the travel ban originally put in place under the Trump administration (https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-to-require-foreign-nationals-seeking-entry-to-show-proof-of-covid-19-vaccination-11632147264).

In related news, the United States has extended Canada and Mexico border restrictions for nonessential travel, including tourism, until 21 Oct 2021.

Finally, today 2 major American public school districts have announced new policies aimed at keeping kids in in-person learning. Washington, DC Mayor Muriel Bowser announced that all adults in public and private schools, as well as daycare centers, must be fully vaccinated by 1 Nov 2021. "We know that vaccinations are the most effective tool to slow the spread of COVID-19 and protect children who are not yet eligible to receive the vaccine," said Bowser in a press release. "This new mandate requirement, without a test-out option, will add another critical layer to the robust measures we have implemented to reopen our schools and keep our childcare centers safe" (https://mayor.dc.gov/release/mayor-bowser-announces-covid-19-vaccination-requirements-all-adults-regularly-schools-and).

And in New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio said officials will begin conducting weekly, random COVID-19 tests of unvaccinated students. The teachers' union had requested weekly testing instead of biweekly testing in the district, which has about one million students (https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/20/nyregion/covid-vaccine-schools-nyc.html).

[2] Johnson & Johnson booster
Date: Tue 21 Sep 2021
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/09/jj-booster-94-effective-against-severe-covid-company-says


Today [21 Sep 2021] Johnson & Johnson (J&J) announced that a 2nd dose of its COVID-19 vaccine given 2 months after the 1st raises its effectiveness against moderate to severe disease to 94% in the United States. The booster was also well tolerated, generating side effects similar to those observed after the 1st dose.

In a press release, the company said that its phase 3 US clinical trial data showed that a booster dose given at 56 days conferred 94% protection against moderate to severe disease in nearly 30 000 adult participants. The confidence interval (CI), however, was wide, at 58% to 100%, leaving doubt as to the precision of the finding (https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-real-world-evidence-and-phase-3-data-confirming-strong-and-long-lasting-protection-of-single-shot-covid-19-vaccine-in-the-u-s).

J&J also said that antibody levels quadrupled when a booster dose was administered at 56 days, while they jumped 12-fold when the booster was given at 6 months. Median follow-up was 36 days. The data have not been peer-reviewed, but the company said it would submit them for publication soon. "We now have generated evidence that a booster shot further increases protection against COVID-19 and is expected to extend the duration of protection significantly," Paul Stoffels, MD, J&J chief scientific officer, said in the release.

Some experts, such as Florian Krammer, PhD, of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, have commented that the press release was low on data. "What I'd like to see from J&J is data on efficacy over time, delta-specific data and data on efficacy/effectiveness against infection and mild disease," he said today [21 Sep 2021] on Twitter (https://bit.ly/3AxZ9g0).

US booster shot disposition up in the air
-----------------------------------------
The announcement comes as J&J approaches the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for emergency-use authorization for a booster dose. The company said it has submitted data to the FDA and will share it with other regulators, the World Health Organization (WHO), and National Immunization Technical Advisory Groups to inform local vaccination strategies.

Last month [August 2021], the Biden administration said it intended to offer booster doses to Americans who received the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. But while FDA advisors on Friday [17 Sep 2021] voted to recommend authorization of booster doses for high-risk and older (65 years and up) Americans, they said they needed to see more data before endorsing broader approval. The FDA is expected to vote on that vaccine this week.

The WHO has urged rich countries to withhold offering booster shots to their residents until at least the end of December [2021] in order to share doses with Africa, where they are in very short supply. Experts from WHO and the FDA also said in a 13 Sep 2021 commentary in The Lancet that extra doses should be diverted where they are sorely needed rather than to those who are already well protected (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)02046-8/fulltext).

Even without a J&J booster, though, the company points to a separate real-world study of 390 000 Americans that shows its vaccine's effectiveness after one dose. The non-peer-reviewed study indicated that the single dose had 79% (95% CI, 77% to 80%) effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection and 81% (95% CI, 79% to 84%) effectiveness against hospitalization at least 28 days later, relative to an unvaccinated control group of 1.52 million similar Americans (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.10.21263385v2).

Effectiveness against hospitalization varied according to age, at 86% in vaccinees younger than 60 years and 78% in those 60 and older. Vaccine effectiveness didn't wane over the March to July study period, even in response to the more transmissible delta (B1617.2) variant, according to the release.

[3] United Nations General Assembly
Date: Tue 21 Sep 2021
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/09/un-general-assembly-opener-highlights-pandemic-covid-19-vaccine-gaps


On the 1st day of high-level discussion at the United Nations General Assembly, leaders of Brazil and the United States were among the first to address the gathering, underscoring underlying tensions about COVID-19 measures but also drawing needed attention to vaccine gaps.

Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro, the 1st leader to speak, touched on the pandemic in his speech, but other elements of his presence drew attention to his defiance over tough COVID-19 measures, according to the Washington Post (https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/09/21/brazil-bolsonaro-vaccine-un-general-assembly/).

Bolsonaro reportedly isn't fully vaccinated, and United Nations rules specify that those in the General Assembly hall must be vaccinated under an "honor system." Brazil's leader has said he doesn't need to be vaccinated because he has immunity following a previous infection.

During his speech, he said his administration supports vaccination efforts, but not vaccine passports or mandates. He also said COVID-19 restrictions have hurt country economies, according to Al Jazeera (https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/9/21/world-leaders-united-nations-general-assembly).

Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden in his address to leaders said collective action and political will is needed to bring the pandemic to an end. He said a new mechanism is needed to fund global health security against future threats (https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/09/21/remarks-by-president-biden-before-the-76th-session-of-the-united-nations-general-assembly/). He also alluded to a global COVID-19 virtual summit he is hosting tomorrow [22 Sep 2021], and he hinted that the United States will make additional commitments.

More global headlines
---------------------
- In Australia, violent protests flared in Melbourne for the 2nd day in a row, with protesters airing frustrations about lockdowns and pushing back against a plan to require construction workers to be vaccinated, according to the Washington Post (https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/09/21/australia-melbourne-vaccine-protests-construction-lockdown/).
- China reported 42 more cases today [21 Sep 2021] in Fujian province outbreaks, including 36 from Xiamen, according to the country's National Health Commission (http://en.nhc.gov.cn/2021-09/21/c_84642.htm).
- The global total today [21 Sep 2021] topped 229 million and is at 229 400 528 cases, along with 4 705 370 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins online dashboard (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/).
