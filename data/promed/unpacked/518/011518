Newcastle disease, suspected - Malaysia: RFI 20010626.1212

Regarding the avian disease in Malaysia, it is important to realize that,
without some diagnostics and a sharp pathologist with skilled eyes and
hands, it is nearly impossible to distinguish between Velogenic
Viscerotropic Newcastle's Disease (VND) from Highly Pathogenic Avian
Influenza (HPAI). When the clinical signs are presented, one needs to be
concerned about both of these diseases, especially if wild birds are
involved. However, if VND is suspected, it is usually because there are
neurological signs and lesions.
Malaysia isn't far from Hong Kong where Avian Influenza H5N1 has been
found, or other HPAI that may be lurking in SAR and China.
