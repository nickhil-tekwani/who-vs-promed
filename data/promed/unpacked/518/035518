Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Singapore Zoo, Singapore
Date of start of the outbreak: 14 Aug 2018
Outbreak status: resolved 17 Jan 2018
Epidemiological unit: zoo
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Sambar: _Cervus unicolor_ (Cervidae) / 16 000 / 8 / 0 / 2 / 0
Affected population: maggot larvae had been observed to be infesting the wounds of a variety of species. Samples of maggot larvae were obtained from live sambar (_Rusa unicolor_ or _Cervus unicolor_) exhibiting signs of infestation. There are 16 000 susceptible animals at the Singapore zoo.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Sambar: _Cervus unicolor_ (Cervidae)/ 0.05 / 0 / 0 / 0.01
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: vectors
Epidemiological comments: no cases have been detected in livestock farms. The detection of Old World screwworm based on morphological examination has also been supported by 3rd party laboratory examination on [20 Dec 2017].

Control measures
Measures applied: quarantine, official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste, disinfection, ante and post-mortem inspections, vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists), treatment of affected animals (wound is cleaned and larvicide applied. Wounds are monitored.)
Measures to be applied: surveillance within containment and/or protection zone, disinfestation, control of vectors

[Screwworms (Diptera: Calliphoridae) are fly larvae of flies that feed on living flesh. These parasites infest all mammals and, rarely, birds. _Chrysomya bezziana_ is the major cause of traumatic myiasis in the tropical regions of the Old World. The lesions caused by its larval infestations on livestock cause great pain and suffering and result in considerable economic losses to farmers. The biology of _C. bezziana_ is remarkably similar to that of the New World screwworm fly, _Cochliomyia hominivorax_. This finding in Singapore is really bad news and an immediate response is required. - Mod.PMB
