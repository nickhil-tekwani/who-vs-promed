In Sirajganj [district, Rajshahi division], at least 4 people were found to be infected with anthrax, a bacterial disease that spreads from cattle, in Baghabari Paschimpar village in Shahjadpur upazila [sub district] on Sunday [10 Mar 2013], reports our Pabna correspondent. Upazila health officials primarily identified the symptoms and said that the patients were being treated at the health complex. The infected patients are aged between 19 and 25 years.

Residential medical officer at Shahjadpur upazila health complex Dr Abdur Rahman said (that) 2 of those with anthrax came to the upazila health complex on Sunday [10 Mar 2013]. After confirming their infection, a medical team visited the village on the same day and found 2 more infected with the [bacterium]. They are now undergoing treatment, he said.

Dr Rahman said that the patients contacted the disease while handling the meat of an infected cow at the village on 27 Feb 2013. The sores on the infected people show the symptoms of anthrax, he added. A sample of the cow meat has been sent to Dhaka for diagnosing, he said.

[The nationwide epidemic in 2011 was a result of feeding contaminated feed to the dairy cows during the monsoon; see: A Fasanella, G Garofolo, MJ Hossain, M Shamsuddin, JK Blackburn, M Hugh-Jones. Bangladesh anthrax outbreaks are probably caused by contaminated livestock feed http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=8644675.

This recent outbreak in Sirajganj is before the monsoon season and therefore livestock would have been grazing. But Sirajganj has a clay soil and enzootic anthrax is not reported for such areas. So it will be interesting to see what the veterinary services find as to the cause of this outbreak. So far only the public health response has been reported. - Mod.MHJ
