Swedish tourists acquired _Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria in Khao Sok National
Park, southern Thailand
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Two Swedish male tourists, 27 and 67 years old respectively, have
been admitted to our hospital in Stockholm with _P. falciparum_
malaria within one week.

The younger man spent 2 weeks in Thailand (26 Jan-9 Feb 2009). He
visited Au Nang, Koh Klang, and stayed overnight in Khao Sok National
Park, from 6-7 Feb [2009] in budget accommodation. The park is a
popular tourist attraction in the Surat Thani Province, in the
southern part of the country. The older man also travelled in
southern Thailand (27 Jan-20 Feb 2009) independent of the other man.
He spent most of the time on Koh Jan, south of Krabi, but also 3 days
in Khao Sok National Park at Green Valley Resort, from 3-6 Feb
[2009]. The men did not take chemoprophylaxis for malaria, according
to the Swedish guidelines.

The men fell ill on 18 Feb and 19 Feb [2009] respectively. Upon
admission to the hospital, the young man was icteric but he had no
other signs of severe malaria. Analysis of the blood film showed _P.
falciparum_, 0.1 percent parasitaemia. The 2nd case was in good
general condition but had a parasitaemia of 2.5 percent. Both
responded well to treatment with artemisinin derivatives.

We believe the 2 travellers acquired their malaria infections in Khao
Sok National Park, despite the statement on the website of the park
that it is free of malaria. In 2002, a Swede contracted _P.
falciparum_ malaria in the same park.

An increased awareness of the risk to acquire _P. falciparum_ malaria
while visiting Khao Sok National Park in southern Thailand is
warranted.

[Thailand reported 33 019 malaria cases in 2006 with 113 deaths (World
Malaria Report, WHO 2008). ProMED-mail would be interested to receive
further information and reports of other cases imported from Thailand.
