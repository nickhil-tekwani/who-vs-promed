The state ordered the vaccination of millions of hens at Connecticut's
largest egg farm in response to an outbreak of avian flu that led to a
temporary Japanese ban on U.S. poultry imports.
State officials will supervise the vaccination at the egg farm and the farm
will foot the bill, acting Agriculture Commissioner Bruce Gresczyk said
Friday. He didn't know how much the operation would cost.
The alternative was killing all 3 million infected birds, he said.
All hens entering the egg production line will be vaccinated, Gresczyk
said, adding: "It's never been done on such a large scale before."
The vaccinations require federal approval because the serum is at a state
laboratory in Maine and must be transported across state lines. U.S.
Department of Agriculture approval is expected within the next 2 weeks.
Avian flu was confirmed this week in chickens at the egg farm. It resulted
in just a few bird deaths, and the birds that recovered now have a
lifetime immunity, Gresczyk said.
The outbreak prompted Japan to temporarily ban all U.S. poultry imports;
that ban has yet to be lifted for Connecticut poultry.
The low-pathogen form of the disease does not affect humans or other
mammals. It also does not affect eggs, and normal egg production has
resumed, Gresczyk said. The egg farm supplies nearly 90 percent of the
eggs in the state and much of the New England market, producing nearly 24
million eggs a week. It employs 290 people.
State officials are checking whether avian flu has occurred at other farms.
