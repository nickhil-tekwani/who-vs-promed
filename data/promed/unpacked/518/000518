Foot and mouth disease in Zimbabwe
--------------------------------
An outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Matabeleland reported on 16 Aug
2001 was received [by the Office International des Epizooties on 21 Aug
2001 from Dr Stuart K Hargreaves, director of veterinary services, Ministry
of Agriculture, Harare.
The affected population were cattle in a feedlot consisting mainly of a
mixture of Brahman x indigenous beef breeds of slaughter age. One dead calf
was also discovered at inspection. Although the cattle were in several
pens, they had previously been mixed during selection of those ready for
slaughter. There was also a resident flock of only 9 Blackhead Persian
sheep in one pen.
Total number of animals in the new outbreak:
species / susceptible / cases / deaths / destroyed / slaughtered
bov / 7680 / 400 / 1 / 0 / 0
ovi / 9 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0
Diagnosis: infection was first suspected in 4 animals slaughtered at the
Bulawayo abattoir and traced back to the Willsgrove Feedlot. Fresh ruptured
mouth lesions [2-3 days old were seen in most of the affected animals, but
a few cattle had healing mouth and feet lesions. No infection was detected
in the sheep.
Epidemiology: it is suspected that the feedlot may have received illegal
cattle originating from the control zones for foot and mouth disease. Trace
back investigations are in process. Inspection of neighbouring farms
suggests that there has been no spread of infection from the feedlot.
Control measures: all animal movements throughout the country have been
suspended except from low risk areas for immediate slaughter.
The last outbreak reported was in July 1999.

Foot and mouth disease spreads in Zimbabwe
------------------------------
The outbreak of foot and mouth disease (FMD) has spread to 5 properties in
Masvingo, Matabeleland North and South provinces of Zimbabwe, bringing to 6
the number of feedlots infected by the disease over the past 5 days. A task
force, including director of veterinary services Stuart Hargreaves and a
senior official from the Veterinary Services Council, has been set up to
monitor the situation and control the spread of the disease.
The outbreak has been described as a national crisis requiring concerted
efforts to control it. The veterinary officials have so far inspected 100
properties involving 100 000 cattle in the 3 provinces and are optimistic
about containing the disease.
To date, 5 further properties have been positively identified on clinical
signs and quarantined. All cattle movements have been suspended until
further notice except for those going directly to slaughter at registered
abattoirs for local consumption. Dairy products have also been suspended
until further notice, Hargreaves said.
