1st report of perithecia of_ Phaeoacremonium viticola_ on grapevine (_Vitis
vinifera_) and ash tree (_Fraxinus latifolia_) in California. A Eskalen, S
Rooney-Latham, WD Gubler, Department of Plant Pathology, University of
California, Davis 95616. Plant Dis 2005; 89:686, published online as DOI:
10.1094/PD-89-0686B. Accepted for publication 15 Mar 2005.
Esca and Petri diseases on grapevine are caused by _Phaeomoniella
chlamydospora_ and species of _Phaeoacremonium_ including _P. aleophilum_,
_P. viticola_, _P. angustius_, _P. parasiticum_, _P. inflatipes_, _P.
rubrigenum_, and _P. mortoniae_. The teleomorphs of _P. aleophilum_ and _P.
mortoniae_ have been recently confirmed as _Togninia minima_ (Tul. & C.
Tul.) Berl. (2,3), and _T. fraxinopennsylvanica_ (Hinds) Hausner,
Eyjolfsdottir & J. Reid, respectively (1,2,3). Teleomorphs of other
_Phaeoacremonium_ spp. have not been identified, although molecular data
suggests that _Phaeaoacremonium_ spp. are linked to the genus _Togninia_.
Naturally infected vineyards with symptoms of esca disease were surveyed
during the summer and fall of 2004. Samples were collected from declining
ash trees surrounding the vineyards, as well as from symptomatic grapevine
trunks, cordons, and spurs. Samples were processed as previously described
(1). Sterile isolations were also made from symptomatic vascular tissue of
the samples and cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA)-tet medium.
Perithecia were found on the surfaces of old pruning wounds and in the
cracks of cordons and trunks on _Vitis vinifera_ cvs. Thompson Seedless,
Riesling, and Cabernet Sauvignon. Perithecia were observed on grapevines in
vineyards in 6 of 9 counties, viz. Yolo, Mendocino, El Dorado, Tulare,
Madera, and Sonoma. Perithecia were also observed in dead vascular tissue
of declining ash tree branches (_Fraxinus latifolia_) located in the
vicinity of vineyards in Sonoma and Yolo counties. Perithecia were black,
globose to subglobose, ranging from 160 to 215 micrometers in diameter, and
were both embedded in and superficial on the wood tissue. Neck lengths
ranged from 55 to 340 micrometers.
The asci were hyaline, clavate, and ranged in size from 12.5 to 19.5 x 3.2
to 4.5 micrometers. Ascospores were hyaline, ellipsoid to allantoid, and
ranged in size from 3.1 to 4.1 x 1.8 to 2.1 micrometers. Morphologically
these perithecia resemble those of _Togninia_ spp. When plated onto PDA-tet
medium, ascospores formed colonies of _P. viticola_ after 10 days of
incubation at room temperature. Additionally, _P. viticola_ was isolated
from vascular tissue of the collected plant specimens.
To our knowledge, this is the 1st time that _P. viticola_ has been linked
to a sexual state.

[A group of _Phaeoacremonium_ isolates, first distinguished by red
pigmentation on the reverse of their colonies, is described as a new
species, _P. viticola_, on the basis of molecular data. An intensive
sampling in French vineyards affected by the Esca disease has shown that
this species is rare compared to _P. aleophilum_ and _P. chlamydosporum_
and is often associated with symptoms on the fruits. Esca is a complex of
diseases rather than a single pathogen causing symptoms associated with the
disease. It is likely that different organisms cause specific but similar
symptoms. Esca is primarily a disease of mature vines (10 years +). The
definition of esca has been recently revised. The proposed definition reads
as follows: Esca is the series of pathological events, the series start in
the nursery, continues in the young vineyard and completes its development
when the plant is mature. Similarly, young decline (commonly known as Black
goo) is caused by _Phaeomoniella chlamydospora_ and other _Phaeoacremonium_
spp. In Australia, the disease affects young and mature vines. Following
discussions, it was decided that "Petri Disease" will precede the names
"black goo", phaeocremonium grapevine decline, and young decline.
That _Phaeoacremonium viticola_ [Pv] can infect ash (_Fraxinus latifolia_)
represents an alternative source of inoculum that may be of some
significance in the epidemiology of esca.
