[Ref: A Takele et al (2015): Status of Wheat Septoria Leaf Blotch (_Septoria tritici_ Roberge in Desmaz) in South West and Western Shewa Zones of Oromiya Regional State, Ethiopia. Research in Plant Sciences 3, 43-48; DOI: 10.12691/plant-3-3-1]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Septoria leaf blotch is one of the most yield limiting diseases of wheat production in Ethiopian highlands. [A] survey was conducted during October to November 2014, so as to assess the incidence and severity of the disease in 14 districts of South-west and West Shewa zones. A total of 97 farms within 64 farmer's associations were observed.

The incidence of septoria leaf blotch varied from 75-100 per cent, and severity index ranged from 4 to 89 per cent. [A] mean incidence of 100 per cent and mean severity index of 61 per cent were recorded on bread wheat variety Danda'a, and on [the] local variety the incidence was 100 per cent and severity index was 67 per cent.

When wheat was preceded by cereals, the mean incidence of septoria leaf blotch was 100 per cent, and severity index was 70 per cent. Whereas when wheat was [preceded] by pulse crops, the incidence declined to 96 per cent and severity index to 45 per cent.

In the highlands of 2500-3500 meters, incidence and severity substantially increased up to 100 per cent and 62 per cent, respectively. Septoria leaf blotch incidence and severity were much more pronounced in varieties sown during July than August and September.

All released commercial varieties were found to be susceptible to the pathogen, and the disease remained to be a threat to the production of wheat in all surveyed areas. Control strategies urgently need to be devised.

[Septoria leaf blotch of cereals is caused by fungi in the septoria species complex which includes _Zymoseptoria tritici_ (previously _Septoria tritici_) , _Mycosphaerella graminicola_ and _Phaeosphaeria nodorum_ (previously _Stagonospora nodorum_). The disease affects mainly wheat, but also barley, oats and occasionally rye and some grass species. Symptoms on wheat and barley are very similar and may occur at any time during the growth of the plant and on any portion of the plant. They include blotches on both leaves and glumes, which reduce the photosynthetic ability of the host. Up to 50 per cent yield losses have been reported on susceptible varieties.

Spores can be spread by infected plant material, wind, water (rain splash) and mechanical means. The pathogens can overwinter on crop debris and on autumn-sown crops or volunteers. Disease management includes fungicide treatments aimed at preventing the disease becoming established on the upper 3 leaves of the crop canopy, removal of inoculum sources (above achieved by crop rotation with pulses) and use of resistant varieties. Emerging fungicide resistance of septoria blotch has been reported in recent years from Europe, Australasia and North America (see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives).

Septoria is considered the most important foliar disease of winter wheat in parts of the northern hemisphere, but the information above now provides data on its impact in Africa. After the cereal rusts, the disease is the most important challenge to plant breeders (see ProMED-mail post 20120831.1274190) and a threat to food security worldwide.
