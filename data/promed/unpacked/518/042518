100 Die Of Mystery Disease In 30 Days
-----------------------------------------------
A mysterious disease killed at least 100 people since early Sep 1999 in the
commune of Yambala, in Angola's Benguela province, traditional leaders said.
According to Francisco Cavalo, a traditional leader who trekked to the
municipality of Cubal to alert the leaders, 30 people between 18 and 24
years old died in just last week.
The disease, which claims the life of its victim within 5 hours, has the
symptoms of headache and fever.
Cavalo said at least 10 people die daily in the localities of Kakalanda,
Songue, Sonde and Kandonga, all situated in the commune of Yambala, some 64
km from Cubal.
Without health facilities and personnel, residents have begun to flee
Yambala with an estimated population of 70 000.
