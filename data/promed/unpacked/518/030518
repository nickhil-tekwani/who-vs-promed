2 elk killed in the southern Sacramento Mountains of south east New Mexico
have tested positive for chronic wasting disease (CWD), the Department of
Game and Fish announced. The animals were the first elk in New Mexico to
test positive for CWD since the disease was first discovered in mule deer
in 2002.
Both CWD-afflicted elk were killed in an area 10 to 15 miles southeast of
Cloudcroft in Game Management Unit 34, the same general area where the
state's most recent case of CWD was detected in a mule deer. One of the elk
-- a mature male -- was taken on 3 Oct 2005 by a hunter and showed no
symptoms of the disease. The other elk -- a yearling female -- was in very
poor condition and unable to stand when a Department of Game and Fish
conservation officer found it 1 Oct 2005. Testing and verification of the
samples required about 2 months. Future testing is expected to occur more
quickly as the Department of Game and Fish and the Veterinary Diagnostic
Services in the New Mexico Department of Agriculture further implement
recently achieved in-state CWD testing capabilities.
"The range in which the disease is found appears to be expanding, so
finding it in more animals in that area is not surprising," said Kerry
Mower, the department's lead wildlife disease biologist. "But it is
disappointing to find our first cases of CWD in free-ranging elk."
Brain stem samples from the 2 elk were among more than 100 taken from deer
and elk in Unit 34 this year and sent to the Veterinary Diagnostic Services
Laboratory in Albuquerque. The Albuquerque laboratory's "presumptive
positive" samples from the 2 elk were confirmed as CWD-positive by the
National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa.
"We will continue our efforts to monitor the disease by actively testing
animals in Units 34 and 19," Mower said. "We also encourage all hunters
statewide to submit their animals for testing." The department personally
informs hunters if the tests are positive. Hunters will be able to see the
complete list of test results as they become available on the department
website: <http://www.wildlife.state.nm.us>.
This season, hunters who kill animals in a "control area" of Unit 34 are
required to submit their animals for testing and observe special
regulations affecting which body parts of a deer or elk can be removed from
the unit. Hunting seasons continue in that area into January. Chronic
wasting disease is a fatal neurological illness that afflicts deer, elk and
moose. There is no evidence of CWD being transmitted to humans or
livestock. The disease causes animals to become emaciated, display abnormal
behavior, and lose control of bodily functions. To date, it has been found
in captive and wild deer, elk, and moose in 8 states and 2 Canadian provinces.
The origin of CWD in New Mexico is unknown. It has been found in 12 wild
deer and 2 wild elk since 2002, when the disease was first discovered east
of Las Cruces. All of the CWD-positive deer and elk in New Mexico were from
the southern Sacramento Mountains southeast of Cloudcroft and areas
surrounding the Organ Mountains near Las Cruces.
