[The affected Eurasian Sparrowhawk presented neurological signs, was collected, and tested positive for HPAI H5N8 (thanks to Nati Elkin).

According to BirdLife Israel, this species has become an abundant breeder in northern and central Israel, as far south as Beer-Sheva. The national population must hold a few thousands of pairs. https://www.birds.org.il/en/species-page/136/species-description.

Israel suffered a wide-scale HPAI H5N1 outbreak between Oct 2021 - Jan 2022, including mass mortality of migrating cranes in a nature reserve in the north. The disease spread to poultry farms, leading to the culling of about a million birds. This event was attributed mainly to a wild-bird-feeding policy which led to their exceeded population density. Publication of a final report of the event, conclusions, and science-based decisions on future wildlife protection and maintenance policy and relevant biosecurity measures, are anticipated. - Mod.AS
