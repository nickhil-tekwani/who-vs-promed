Iran halts beef imports from the Netherlands
--------------------------------------------
Text of report by the Iranian news agency IRNA Tehran, 5 Sep 1998:
Iran's ambassador to Amsterdam, Shamseddin Khareqani, said on Friday (4th
September) that Iran has stopped slaughtering cattle and packaging of the
Netherlands beef to be exported to Iran.
He said that the decision was adopted following reports of fresh outbreak
of the mad cow disease in the Netherlands. The Dutch newspaper 'Telegraaf'
in a recent issue said that discovery of a new case of the mad cow disease
in northern parts of the Netherlands will have severe impact on country's
beef industry.
