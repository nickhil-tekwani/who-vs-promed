Just over 7 years ago (May 2014) we saw a report from Sichuan, China of the first known infection by HPAI [highly pathogenic avian influenza] H5N6 avian influenza in humans. At the time, H5N1 and (LPAI) [low pathogenic avian influenza] H7N9 were the biggest avian flu threats, with H10N8 and H9N2 (which is still very much with us) pulling up the rear.

While H5N1 has declined markedly since 2015, and China's massive poultry vaccination program, which began in 2017 has -- at least temporarily -- subdued H7N9, we continue to see sporadic human infections with H5N6.

Unlike the novel swine variants, and recent H10N3 and H5N8 human infections -- which have been mostly mild -- avian H5N6 tends to make humans severely ill, and death has been reported in nearly half of the 32 cases to date.

Last month, Sichuan Province reported their 2nd human case -- and the 3rd reported by China since the first of the year [2021] -- which followed 4 cases reported in late 2020. Today's case (#33), announced today [14 Jul 2021] by Hong Kong's CHP, makes the 8th case reported in as many months.

First the CHP's statement, then I'll return with a brief postscript.

CHP closely monitors human case of avian influenza A(H5N6) in Sichuan

The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) is today (14 July) closely monitoring a human case of avian influenza A(H5N6) in Sichuan Province, and again urges the public to maintain strict personal, food, and environmental hygiene both locally and during travel.

The case involves a 55-year-old man living in Bazhong City in Sichuan Province. He developed symptoms on [Wed 30 Jun 2021] and was admitted to hospital for treatment on [Sun 4 Jul 2021]. The patient is in critical condition. The patient had contact with live domestic poultry before the onset of symptoms.

From 2014 to date, 32 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported by the Mainland [China] health authorities. "All novel influenza A infections, including H5N6, are notifiable infectious diseases in Hong Kong," a spokesman for the CHP said.

Travellers to the Mainland or other affected areas must avoid visiting wet markets, live poultry markets or farms. They should be alert to the presence of backyard poultry when visiting relatives and friends. They should also avoid purchasing live or freshly slaughtered poultry, and avoid touching poultry/birds or their droppings. They should strictly observe personal and hand hygiene when visiting any places with live poultry.

Travellers returning from affected areas should consult a doctor promptly if symptoms develop, and inform the doctor of their travel history for prompt diagnosis and treatment of potential diseases. It is essential to tell the doctor if they have seen any live poultry during travel, which may imply possible exposure to contaminated environments. This will enable the doctor to assess the possibility of avian influenza and arrange necessary investigations and appropriate treatment in a timely manner.

While local surveillance, prevention and control measures are in place, the CHP will remain vigilant and work closely with the WHO and relevant health authorities to monitor the latest developments.

The public should maintain strict personal, hand, food and environmental hygiene and take heed of the advice below when handling poultry:
- Avoid touching poultry, birds, animals or their droppings;
- When buying live chickens, do not touch them and their droppings. Do not blow at their bottoms. Wash eggs with detergent if soiled with faecal matter and cook and consume the eggs immediately. Always wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling chickens and eggs;
- Eggs should be cooked well until the white and yolk become firm. Do not eat raw eggs or dip cooked food into any sauce with raw eggs. Poultry should be cooked thoroughly. If there is pinkish juice running from the cooked poultry or the middle part of its bone is still red, the poultry should be cooked again until fully done;
- Wash hands frequently, especially before touching the mouth, nose or eyes, before handling food or eating, and after going to the toilet, touching public installations or equipment such as escalator handrails, elevator control panels or door knobs, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing; and
- Wear a mask if fever or respiratory symptoms develop, when going to a hospital or clinic, or while taking care of patients with fever or respiratory symptoms.

The public may visit the CHP's pages for more information: the avian influenza page, the weekly Avian Influenza Report, global statistics and affected areas of avian influenza, the Facebook Page and the YouTube Channel.

It is worth noting that following nearly 3 relatively quiet years from mid-2017 to early 2020, avian influenza activity in China -- and around the globe -- has been rising, with HPAI H5 viruses and LPAI H9N2 leading the way.

China has reported 8 H5N6 human infections since November 2020, more than a dozen mild H9N2 infections, and at least 1 H10N3 infection. In addition, Laos has reported both a human H5N1 and a human H5N6 infection since last fall.

In February of 2021, Russia reported the first confirmed human infections with avian H5N8 (see https://afludiary.blogspot.com/2021/02/russian-media-reports-7-human.html), and in May [2021] the CDC Added Zoonotic Avian A/H5N8 To Their IRAT List.

Given the lack of influenza surveillance and reporting from many parts of the world, it is likely that additional cases go unreported. While we aren't anywhere near the levels of avian flu human infections we were seeing between 2003 and 2016, this recent uptick is worth our attention.

Hong Kong health officials report monitoring a human case of avian influenza A(H5N6) in Sichuan Province on the Mainland. The case involves a 55-year-old man living in Bazhong City in Sichuan Province. He developed symptoms on [Wed 30 Jun 2021] and was admitted to hospital for treatment on [Sun 4 Jul 2021]. The patient is in critical condition. The patient had contact with live domestic poultry before the onset of symptoms.

This is the 32nd human case of avian influenza A(H5N6) reported by the Mainland health authorities since 2014.

Avian influenza is caused by those influenza viruses that mainly affect birds and poultry, such as chickens or ducks. Clinical presentations of avian influenza in humans include eye infection (conjunctivitis), flu-like symptoms (e.g. fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches) or severe respiratory illness (e.g. chest infection). The incubation period ranges from 7 to 10 days.

The more virulent forms can result in respiratory failure, multi-organ failure, and even death. People mainly become infected with avian influenza virus through contact with infected birds and poultry (live or dead) or their droppings, or contact with contaminated environments (such as wet markets and live poultry markets). Human-to-human transmission is inefficient.

People in close contact with poultry are more susceptible to contracting avian influenza. The elderly, children, and people with chronic illness have a higher risk of developing complications such as bronchitis and chest infection.

[To date, a total of 32 laboratory-confirmed cases (excluding the case above) of human infection with influenza A(H5N6) virus, including 19 deaths at the time of the IHR (International Health Regulations) report, have been reported to WHO from China since 2014 [https://bit.ly/3wMoHTO]

According to reports received by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), various influenza A(H5) subtypes continue to be detected in birds in Africa, Europe, and Asia. With the continued incidence of avian influenza due to existing and new influenza A(H5) viruses in poultry, there is a need to remain vigilant in the animal and public health sectors. Community awareness of the potential dangers for human health is essential to prevent infection in humans.

Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk for sporadic infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Therefore, sporadic human cases are not unexpected. Surveillance should be continued to detect human cases and early changes in transmissibility and infectivity of the viruses. - Mod.UBA
