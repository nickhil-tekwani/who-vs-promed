Tuberculosis, bovine (Alcona County, Michigan, USA)
---------------------------------------------------
State officials quarantined an Alcona County dairy herd after tests
indicated the possible presence of bovine tuberculosis (TB) in one of the cows.
Dr Joan Arnoldi, veterinarian with the Michigan Department of Agriculture,
declined to name the herd owner, but said tests likely indicate bovine TB
in a 5 year old cow in the 200-plus animal herd. The herd was quarantined
on 27 Nov. "(Researchers) isolated an organism from a cow that was a
suspect," Arnoldi said. "The cow didn't show lesions, but they could have
been microscopic lesions that we couldn't see."
"We have a good idea it's positive, but we're not willing to call it
positive yet," she said. Arnoldi said the herd tested negative for the
infectious disease in 1998, 2000, and 2001, but the TB suspect was
discovered during a test last August. Final tests results should be
available by mid-January, she said.
Officials say there is additional concern because of considerable movement
between the quarantined herd and 3 other cattle herds in the area. The
state is attempting to trace the various sales and herd movement. "People
who purchased or sold animals with this farmer will be contacted," said
Bridget Patrick, spokeswoman for the state's bovine TB program.
Bovine TB was discovered in the mid-1990s in Michigan and has devastated
Michigan's interstate cattle trade. Officials believe they've confined TB
to 4 north eastern counties and have destroyed numerous herds and
constantly monitor others. White-tailed deer also are susceptible to bovine
TB and are blamed for passing on the disease to cattle. The state has
aggressively reduced deer numbers in Montmorency, Alpena, Oscoda, and
Alcona counties and continues to test deer for the disease.
Before this year, the state had tested 103 405 deer for bovine TB. Of
those, 398 tested positive, Patrick said. This year, officials say between
23 and 29 tested deer show signs of TB infection, she said.
Facts about bovine TB and the outbreak in Michigan:
- bovine TB is a contagious lung disease that can weaken and kill animals.
There's little chance of passing it to humans.
- bovine TB mostly has been found in whitetail deer and cattle. Cases also
have been found in coyotes, bears, bobcats, raccoons, fox, and opossum.
- in June 1998, bovine TB was confirmed in a beef cow in Alpena County.
Since that time the disease has been confirmed in multiple cattle herds in
Michigan.
- bovine TB may be spread among livestock through the air [generally close
contact or in confined areas - Mod.TG] or by consumption of contaminated
water, feed, or milk. The most effective means of controlling the disease
among livestock is by destroying infected and exposed animals.
- dogs, cats, and horses can be infected with bovine TB, but the risk is
very low. Dogs and cats actually are more likely to be infected by the
human form of TB, through exposure to human family members who have the
disease; or by bird TB, from eating infected birds.
