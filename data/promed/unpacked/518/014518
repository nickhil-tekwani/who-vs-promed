First Vaccine for Cat AIDS Approved for Veterinary Use
---------------
The first vaccine for feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) was approved
for commercial production and veterinary use today by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA).
The patented vaccine for this disease, which is a cat form of AIDS,
has been licensed for manufacture to Fort Dodge Animal Health, a
division of Wyeth. Patents for the vaccine are held by the University
of California and the University of Florida.
The vaccine should be available to veterinarians by this summer. "This
vaccine offers the first effective protection for cats against this
often fatal disease," said Niels Pedersen, director of the Center for
Companion Animal Health and an international authority on retroviruses
and immunologic disorders of small animals. "The success of the FIV
vaccine also offers hope that eventually a vaccine will be developed
that will effectively protect against AIDS in humans."
Pedersen and immunologist Janet Yamamoto, now a professor in the
University of Florida's College of Veterinary Medicine, first isolated
the FIV in cats at UC Davis in 1986. Yamamoto began work on a vaccine
for the virus at UC Davis and continued her research at the University
of Florida, Gainesville. She has worked with researchers at Fort Dodge
Animal Health for more than a decade to develop the vaccine.
"We are delighted that many years of research are now coming to
fruition and providing cat owners and veterinarians with a protective
vaccine for FIV," added Larry Fox, director of technology transfer for
UC Davis. Fox formerly was director of Corporate Molecular Biology at
Abbott Laboratories, where he was involved in development of the first
HIV assay and a subsequent recombinant DNA assay for HIV.
Research on vaccines for the different viruses that cause AIDS in
cats, monkeys, and humans continues at UC Davis, which has the
distinction of being home to a veterinary school, medical school, and
a regional primate research center.
Feline immunodeficiency virus is transmitted from cat to cat mainly
through bite wounds, because the virus is present at high levels in
the saliva. Like human AIDS, the virus attacks the body's immune
system, making the animal susceptible to diseases and infections that
usually would have little effect on an FIV-free animal.
Cats infected with FIV may remain healthy for 5 to 10 years before
symptoms such as diarrhea, weight loss, fever, swollen lymph nodes,
and chronic infections appear. Although infected cats may recover from
their initial illness, they become lifelong carriers of the virus.
It is estimated that between 2 percent and 25 percent of the global
domestic cat population is infected with the virus, according to the
USDA. Infection rates are highest in Japan and Australia and lowest in
the United States and Europe. Outdoor roaming cats, older cats, and
cats with chronic ill-health are more likely to be infected.
Aggressive free-roaming males, which are most likely to get into
fights with other cats, are at greatest risk for contracting FIV.
FIV does not infect or cause disease in humans.
The newly approved vaccine is known as a "killed vaccine," made from
an inactivated form of the FIV virus itself. The vaccine stimulates
the protective immune response in the animal's body without the danger
of inadvertently causing the viral disease. The new vaccine is
composed of virus strains from 2 different types of FIV, 1 from North
America and 1 from Asia.
In a study demonstrating the efficacy of the vaccine, cats received 3
doses of the FIV vaccine and a year later were exposed to a different
strain of the virus. It was found that 67 percent of the vaccinated
cats were protected against the virus, while 74 percent of the
non-vaccinated cats became infected with FIV. Studies indicate that
the vaccine provides protection against FIV for at least 12
months.

[This is major news as it will have direct impact on the human side of
this vaccine development. I am getting e-mails already from a number
of sources regarding the excitement of this. It is an emerging
disease -- albeit in low numbers -- but it has been known to sweep
through humane society shelters & catteries and emerges as a major
problem in housing of cats. It has also caused problems for people
with HIV having an FIV positive cat, because of the susceptibility of
transmission to the person.
ProMED-mail does not endorse the vaccine, but rather offers this as
news of a scientific breakthrough regarding serious illness in cats,
and in the hope that technology of this sort may soon be applied to
HIV. - Mod.TG]
