A major Ovine Johnes Disease (OJD) eradication trial has commenced, with
more than 40 properties destocked in New South Wales, Victoria and South
Australia.
The trial, conducted under the National OJD Program, will determine whether
eradication of the disease from infected properties is a viable option. The
OJD Research Co-ordinator with New South Wales Agriculture, Dr David Hall,
says they're already receiving positive results from properties, where the
disease was eradicated 3 seasons ago. Dr David Hall said, "Essentially
we've got about 45 producers nationally in the project, they've actually
started over a 3 year period. Some of them restocked in 1997 and have
already re-stocked with clean sheep, to this point there's been no
indication that the disease has re-emerged."
