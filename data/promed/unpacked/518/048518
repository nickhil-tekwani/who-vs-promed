[1] China to build 100-bed treatment centre in Liberia

China will dispatch an elite unit from the People's Liberation Army to help Ebola-hit Liberia, the Foreign Ministry said on Fri [7 Oct 2014], responding to U.N. calls for a greater global effort to fight the deadly virus in West Africa... Beijing has faced criticism for not doing enough.

The PLA squad, which has experience from a 2002 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), will build a 100-bed treatment centre in Liberia, the 1st such facility in the 3 countries most impacted by Ebola to be constructed and run by a foreign country, said Lin Songtian, director general of the ministry's Department of African Affairs. The centre will be open for operation in a month's time [December 2014], he told a briefing in Beijing. China will also dispatch 480 PLA medical staff to treat Ebola patients, he said. It's the 1st time China [will have] deployed a whole unit of epidemic prevention forces and military medical staff abroad, Lin said.

China is Africa's biggest trade partner, tapping the continent's rich vein of resources to fuel its own economic growth over the past couple of decades. Some critics have rounded on Beijing for not helping more in Africa's hour of need. China has so far donated 750 million yuan (USD 123 million) to 13 African countries and international organisations to combat Ebola, according to the government. "China's assistance will not stop until the Ebola epidemic is eradicated in West Africa," Lin said...

China said in July [2014] that more than half its foreign aid of over USD 14 billion went to Africa. In comparison, the United States spent about USD 46 billion in fiscal year 2015 on foreign aid programmes. China has also dispatched hundreds of aid workers to Africa to combat Ebola, including health experts and medical staff. Sihuan Pharmaceutical Holdings Group Ltd., a Chinese drug maker with military ties, has sent several thousand doses of an experimental Ebola drug to Africa and is planning clinical trials there [See Ebola virus disease - ex Africa (22): Canada, China, France, UK, USA, guidelines 20141022.2891397, item [2]].

Lin said several thousand Chinese nationals live in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, and about a million Chinese nationals live on the African continent... - more

[2] Philippines: donating USD 1 million to UN Ebola fund
Date: Fri 7 Nov 2014

http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/foreign/07-Nov-2014/philippines-to-donate-1m-to-un-s-ebola-fund


The Philippine government said on Fri [7 Nov 2014] that it will donate at least USD 1 million to the United Nations' trust fund to help fight the deadly Ebola virus disease. Philippine President Benigno Aquino III said that the presence of Filipinos abroad, estimated at 10 million, has made it imperative for the country to contribute to the UN's Ebola Response Multi-Partner Trust Fund. Aquino said that the Philippine government will exert all efforts to ensure that the country will remain Ebola-free. The Philippine government has allotted some 26 million pesos [USD 577 000] for the implementation of measures to prevent the entry and spread of Ebola in the country.

Measures put in place by the Philippine government to prevent the spread of the deadly disease include a 21-day quarantine for Filipinos coming from Ebola-stricken countries. Earlier, the Philippine government said that the 142 Filipino peacekeepers who will arrive on 11 Nov [2014] from Liberia will be brought to an island in the northern part of the country where they will be quarantined for 21 days.

[3] Worldwide: social media
Date: Sat 8 Nov 2014

http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(14)62016-X/fulltext


Analysis of social media traffic tells a story of unbalance. During October [2014], there were 21 [million] tweets about Ebola in the USA, compared with 13 480 about Ebola in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone combined. Yet around 5000 deaths and 14 000 cases in West Africa show that the epidemic continues to dominate at the source in these countries, contrary to the media footprint of Ebola...

We opened the [Lancet tweet] discussion by asking both Professors Heymann and Mabey to comment on the situation in West Africa right now, and subsequent questions focused on Africa's current needs, local challenges, cultural issues, and opportunities for treatment and prevention. Within the limit of 140 characters, we paraphrased our experts, who said that:

- "The absolute key is getting the community on board: there are dangers in parachuting western health workers into countries." And,
- "Local solutions to local problems need Africans training Africans, [for example] DRC supporting Guinea, good regional solidarity, a wealth of experience within Africa."

Twitter users echoed this sentiment: "co-operation and partnership between Africans," and "we need to help Africans strengthen their own capacity."
A call for anthropological empathy towards differences between cultures was voiced, triggered by David Heymann's observation that some

- "people in West Africa believe that bodies are full of evil spirits," a valuable and helpful belief if it leads to safer infection control and burial practices.

Our experts agreed that

- "it doesn't help to estimate trajectories. Watch what's happening now; deal with it now. Focus on present, not future."

Moving onto vaccines, David Mabey said,

- "On GSK vaccine: getting funding for Ebola research has been very difficult in the past. Traditionally, biodefense money used [sic] to fund [it]," which led Twitter to discuss the use of vaccines outside the framework of randomised trials.

Regarding the state of global health, and the robustness of country governance, we discussed and tweeted the need for stronger country governance, not only stronger global governance. The final question posed to our guests was

"Priorities for the next 60 days?"

- David Mabey said: "More beds in Freetown, train doctors, nurses, higher standard of supportive care. Promote positive African activities," and
- David Heymann added "and concentrate on community...while learning from local successes."

Social media during a health crisis has the potential to bring experts together in a transparent and democratic forum with global participation to generate a mass of new and potentially helpful ideas. Scaling up the positive and constructive discussion of an informed Twitter discussion could remove boundaries between scientists, health professionals, and policy makers, creating a new diverse community that gives everyone a voice and an opportunity to contribute. To create the conditions to defeat Ebola, we need more of that kind of global engagement, knowledge, and commitment.

[4] West Africa: shipping problems, stowaways
Date: Fri 17 Oct 2014 [this only reached ProMED on 8 Nov 2014]

Port closures and risks to crew safety: These are some of the consequences of the current Ebola outbreak for which the shipping industry is bracing itself... Several Danish ship owners have considered refusing to call at West African ports. While maintaining service, all Danish ship owners exercise great caution as regards the risk of infection. Together with a number of ship owners, the Danish Ship Owners' Association has set up a working group to provide advice and information to ship owners on how to avoid infection and how the disease develops.

Traditionally, case law has shown a tendency to focus on the safety of the vessel and not the safety of the crew. However, it cannot be excluded that the Ebola threat to the crew would in itself be sufficient to deem the port unsafe in legal terms. And in all circumstances, the shipowner is responsible for the safety of the crew.

So far, all ports in West Africa are still open. However, since most cargo from West Africa consists of general cargo, ship owners face the additional challenge that local stevedores are being used to a great extent, boarding the vessel in connection with loading and unloading. If a stevedore is a disease carrier, infection may at worst be transmitted to the crew. Consequently, there is a risk of the vessel being placed in quarantine, resulting in delays and off-hire. Unless it is possible under the charter party to refuse to call at the affected ports, it is, therefore, of paramount importance that the crew rigorously comply with the ISPS Code and generally do everything possible to avoid stowaways.

Reports of stowaways from West Africa during the current Ebola outbreak have already resulted in quarantine for several vessels, and a few countries have started to turn away vessels that have recently called at ports in the affected areas.

Consequently, ship owners are increasingly considering whether -- in future charter parties and fixtures -- they should insist on a trading limit (the right to refuse to call at specific harbours) for the countries affected, and whether it is possible to negotiate for the inclusion of such a trading limit in existing charter parties and fixtures.

[5] Morocco: refuses to host Africa football cup
Date: Sat 8 Nov 2014

http://rt.com/news/203595-african-cup-ebola-morocco


Morocco has rejected an ultimatum and refused to host the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations in January [2015] over the fear that Ebola virus may find its way into the country with the crowds of football fans and easily spread among them during the mass sporting event. "The decision is dictated by health reasons because of the serious threat of Ebola and the risk of its spreading," said a statement from Morocco's sports ministry on Sat [8 Nov 2014], the last day when the country was supposed to confirm the hosting of the championship.

The Moroccan government is concerned that a flow of football fans from West Africa could bring the disease to the Ebola-free country and has been asking the confederation to postpone the event until June [2015], and if the virus continues to spread, to January 2016. The fate of the 16-team tournament, scheduled on 17 Jan-8 Feb 2015, will be decided next week when Confederation of African Football (CAF) executives meet in Cairo on Tue [11 Nov 2014]. CAF could either move the event to another country or cancel it, as, so far, no country has volunteered as an emergency host. The Confederation accused Morocco of alarmism and exaggerating the Ebola threat, among other arguments, claiming that "there is unlikely to be a team from the worst affected area in the finals," according to Reuters.
