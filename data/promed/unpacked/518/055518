Although the number of suspected hepatitis E cases has escalated to 54 from 47 since the last update at the end of May 2018, the region has not recorded any new deaths. The Director of Health Information and Research, Puumue Katjiuanjo, said only 13 of the 55 suspected cases have tested positive.

Laboratory results of the other suspected cases were, as of Fri 8 Jun 2018, still pending. Katjiuanjo said the Tsandi District Hospital has recorded 5 positively confirmed cases, which is the highest in the region. Tsandi is followed by Okahao and Outapi district hospitals, which both recorded 2 cases, while Oshikuku registered 2 cases.

Katjiuanjo said 9 people of the confirmed cases have either lived in Havana or Goreangab before travelling to Omusati, while 2 of the cases have a link with the 9 cases. He said the Ministry of Health and Social Services is doing its level best to contain the disease. Katjiuanjo, who is based at the ministry's headquarters in Windhoek, said the officials on the ground are joined by the City of Windhoek to assist the ministry to test water for contamination in the areas where there are suspected cases.

Although the virus has claimed 14 lives in Windhoek in 2018, it has reportedly only claimed one life in Omusati.

[Hepatitis E is found worldwide, and different genotypes of the hepatitis E virus determine differences in epidemiology. For example, genotype 1 is usually seen in developing countries and causes community-level outbreaks, while genotype 3 is usually seen in the developed countries and does not cause outbreaks. Globally, 57 000 deaths and 3.4 million cases of acute hepatitis E are attributable to infection with hepatitis E virus genotypes 1 and 2. Many of the deaths are in pregnant women, characteristic of genotype 1.

The highest seroprevalence rates (number of persons in a population who test positive for the disease) are observed in regions where low standards of sanitation increase the risk for transmission of the virus. Over 60 per cent of all hepatitis E infections and 65 per cent of all hepatitis E deaths occur in east and south Asia, where seroprevalence rates of 25 per cent are common in some age groups. In Egypt, half the population aged above 5 years is serologically positive for the hepatitis E virus (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs280/en/index.html).

Omusati region is one of the 14 regions of Namibia; its capital is Outapi. The region's name, Omusati, comes from the oshiwamo word "omusati" which means "Mopane." The Mopani tree is the dominant species in the region. Omosati is in northwest Namibia; see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omusati_Region. - Mod.LL
