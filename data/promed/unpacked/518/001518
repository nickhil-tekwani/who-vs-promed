Flight spreads measles from San Diego to Hawaii
-----------------------------------------------
San Diego's measles outbreak has spread aboard a planeload of
passengers to Hawaii, where an 11-month-old baby infected in a Bird
Rock medical clinic last month [January 2008] is recovering in
isolation at an island military base. Hawaiian health officials are
trying to find about 250 passengers on the Hawaiian Airlines flight,
especially children, who may have come in contact with the sick
infant, said Dr. Wilma Wooten, San Diego County's public health
officer. "Children who have not been immunized are the ones we're
most concerned about," Wooten said. Health officials also are trying
to find people who were at Lindbergh Field's Terminal 2, Gate 41,
between 8:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. Saturday [9 Feb 2008]. That time
period covers 2 hours before and after the 10:30 a.m. departure of Flight 15.

County health officials on Wednesday [13 Feb 2008] confirmed a 6th
case of measles. A 10-month-old who was hospitalized last week has
testified positive for the viral disease. The infant is believed to
have contracted measles at a medical clinic in Bird Rock where the
1st measles patient was treated. The infant also attended a day care
center and swim school in Pacific Beach.

In less than a month, the outbreak -- San Diego County's 1st since
1991 -- began in Switzerland and has spanned about half the globe. The
case demonstrates how quickly, extensively and silently the
potentially lethal virus can spread. "(It) speaks to the highly
infectious nature of measles," Wooten said. San Diego County health
officials have confirmed measles in 5 patients, and they are
investigating 5 suspected cases. All these children, from infants to a
9-year-old, were not vaccinated because they were younger than 1 --
the minimum age for measles inoculation -- or because their parents
objected to having them vaccinated. The health experts worry that
hundreds of other individuals who may have contracted the virus will
start to exhibit symptoms for weeks to come. More than 30 officials in
San Diego County are working into the night trying to notify parents
of hundreds of potentially exposed children from at least 5 schools,
programs and a clinic, Wooten said. The affected sites include a day
care center and swim school in Pacific Beach; a toddler program and a
school in Clairemont; and a public charter school in Linda Vista.

Measles causes a high fever, cough, runny nose and watery eyes. A
rash usually follows. Symptoms last for one to 2 weeks. In the United
States, measles can be fatal in up to 3 per 1000 children who
contract it. The death rates are higher in developing countries.
Children are more at risk of suffering complications, including
pneumonia and swelling of the brain, than senior citizens. Most
adults have been immunized by the measles vaccine or by getting
measles when they were young.

The outbreak began when a 7-year-old, infected with measles, returned
from a family vacation in Switzerland on 15 Jan 2008. More than 400
cases of measles occur in Switzerland each year, about triple the
total in the United States. The 7-year-old goes to the San Diego
Cooperative Charter School in Linda Vista. The child set off a chain
reaction that has infected 2 siblings, one of whom was a fellow
charter student, and at least one classmate. The 7-year-old's parents
took the youngster to the Children's Clinic of La Jolla, on La Jolla
Boulevard in Bird Rock, CA, on 25 Jan 2008. The child may have
coughed and sneezed in the office, potentially infecting 4 other
patients. Those 4 patients returned to the clinic between 5 and 8 Feb
2008, possibly spreading the virus to 60 other children. One of the
infants who became infected on 25 Jan 2008 at the clinic is the
11-month old whose family flew to Hawaii. Another is a 10-month-old
child who was hospitalized Friday [8 Feb 2008] with measles symptoms,
but whose test results have not been confirmed. This baby went to the
Baldwin Academy day care center and the Murray Callan Swim School,
both in Pacific Beach. A 3rd child suspected of contracting measles
25 Jan 2008 at the clinic is a 2-year-old who attended Alcott
Elementary School's Infant & Toddler Development Program in
Clairemont, CA. On 6 Feb 2008, the youngster also briefly visited the
School of the Madeleine, also in Clairemont.

Dr. Alisa Lawrie, a pediatrician at the clinic, said one child now
known to have measles came in with only a fever and had not developed
the characteristic rash. Because measles is so rare now, she said,
"there was nothing to indicate it was more serious. We thought he
just had a viral illness and sent him home." Lawrie said the outbreak
should send a clear message to parents about the danger of not
vaccinating their children. "This could have been prevented if we had
a fully vaccinated public," she said. "But there's a lot of
misinformation about vaccines, and more and more parents are choosing
not to vaccinate their children."

"Measles is very very contagious," said Dr. Stuart Cohen, a
pediatrician and president-elect of the San Diego County Medical
Society. "Kids under a year who haven't received the routine
vaccination are at risk of getting sick, and that's what will happen
if we start getting higher percentages of parents not vaccinating and
decline to have their children vaccinated based on medical, religious
or personal reasons. Many have done so out of fear -- which doctors
say is unfounded -- that the vaccine may cause autism. The vaccine
does not contain thimerosal, a compound that some people link to
autism. [See link to CDC information at end. - Mod.JW]

Officials for the Baldwin Academy and the Callan swim school said
they have been besieged with phone calls from the public. They are
upset that health officials released the names of their businesses
when they did nothing wrong. Wooten emphasized that the schools and
programs were not to blame. "It is not a reflection of the care or
level of service provided at these facilities," she said.

Measles was widespread in the United States before a vaccine was
developed in the early 1960s. At that time, many parents would be
grateful when their children got measles. The infection meant their
children would be immunized for the rest of their lives. Today,
non-immunization rates throughout San Diego County average 1.6
percent in preschool students and 2.5 percent in kindergarteners,
Wooten said. A total of 10 percent of the children at the San Diego
Cooperative Charter School, where the 7-year-old who started the
outbreak is a student, were not vaccinated. That's the highest
percentage rate of unvaccinated students in the San Diego Unified
School District, said district nurse Eileen Griffiths. Students whose
parents decline vaccination have been barred from returning to their
schools or programs until 26 Feb 2008, when health officials believe
their risk of becoming infected or infecting others would have passed.

[This is an intriguing account of transmission of measles virus from
Switzerland through California to Hawaii via a chain of susceptible
children, unvaccinated as a consequence of young age (less than 12
months) or presence in a community with relatively low vaccine uptake
for fear of autism. The outbreak was amplified by the exposure of
several infants to infection through attendance at a the same doctor's
office.

Dr. Harry F. Hull (<hullhf@msn.com>) has drawn attention to an MMWR
article describing a measles outbreak in New Mexico which also
originated in a doctor's office: see
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00000856.htm>.

Dr. Hull comments that this outbreak is particularly interesting
because the office had passive solar heating, restricting the amount
of fresh air flowing through the room. As a result children were
infected with measles long after the index child left the office,
documenting airborne transmission of measles virus. The article
provides references for 2 additional articles on airborne
transmission of measles virus in medical offices.

It will be interesting to observe whether any of the passengers on the
flight from San Diego to Hawaii succumb to measles. This seems
unlikely since only unvaccinated individuals will have been at risk. -
