Fire blight has hit Quebec apple growers especially hard this year [2016], affecting between 80 and 100 orchards out of 130 in the Laurentians region. Eric Rochon, representing the apple industry, said "Currently, we're in a state of emergency."

The quality of the apples has not been affected, but the immediate future is going to be a lot of hard work for growers. Rochon says the only way to stop the disease from spreading is to rip out the infected branches. Several orchards have already sustained considerable damage fighting the disease.

[A grower] says he believes climate change is responsible for the disease becoming more prevalent. He points out the hot, humid weather we have been experiencing.

In 2014, fire blight hit Nova Scotia [ProMED-mail post 20140908.2756240] affecting nearly every orchard in the province and wiping out 90 per cent of trees. It was believed the bacterium arrived with Tropical Storm Arthur.

[Fireblight is caused by the bacterium _Erwinia amylovora_ and is considered the most destructive disease of pome fruit trees worldwide. Many varieties of pear, quince and apple are susceptible, although the level of susceptibility may vary with cultivars. Only members of the _Rosaceae_ are affected, mainly the sub-family _Maloideae_ (synonym _Pomoideae_), but also many cultivated rose and bramble varieties. The known host range covers more than 140 species from 40 genera. Many ornamental and weed species serve as pathogen reservoirs for crop infections.

The name of the disease is derived from the symptoms of blackening of the leaves as if they were scorched by fire. Affected shoots bend forming black hooks; some fruits may show lesions; cankers appear on branches and trunks, and trees invariably die. The bacteria enter the host plant through wounds and are highly infectious. They are spread by insect activity (including pollinators), wind, water (rain, irrigation), mechanical means (tools, orchard workers) and with plant material (including budwood). Importation of plant material including fruit (shipments may also contain contaminated leaf or twig fragments) from areas with endemic fireblight poses a considerable quarantine risk.

The bacteria overwinter almost exclusively in cankers on limbs infected during the previous season and, consequently, the amount of inoculum and thus the risk of outbreaks are increased following years with high fireblight levels. Phytosanitation and monitoring are used to attempt exclusion of fireblight from individual orchards. Disease management may include cultural measures (such as removal of pathogen reservoirs) and bactericidal sprays. Certain cultivar/rootstock combinations may provide some protection. Currently, the most effective control is application of streptomycin during flowering, but the use of antibiotics in agriculture is mostly subject to strict regulations.

The pathogen is considered a major biosecurity risk in areas where it does not yet occur. A continued spread of _E. amylovora_ to new areas and the emergence of new streptomycin resistant strains are a major concern to pome fruit industries worldwide.
