Bluetongue in France (in the island of Corsica)
-----------------------------------------------
Translation of information received on 16 Jul 2001 from Dr Isabelle
Chmitelin, Deputy Director General, General Directorate for Food, Ministry
of Agriculture and Fisheries, Paris:
Further to a suspicion notified on 9 Jul 2001, the French Agency for Food
Safety (AFSSA) confirmed the presence of bluetongue virus in Propriano
district, Corse-du-Sud department - 4 sick animals gave positive results.
The restriction measures in force since 20 Oct 2000 for susceptible animals
are being maintained, and sanitary police measures are being taken in the
affected farm in accordance with the order dated 31 Oct 2000.

[This report did not give the affected species, though it might be presumed
to be sheep as before; it can affect cattle. This is the first OIE report
on bluetongue for 2001. For those unaccustomed to this orbivirus disease,
it is spread by midges. A closely related virus -- they produce
cross-reacting antibodies to each other -- causes epizootic haemorrhagic
disease of deer. - Mod.MHJ
