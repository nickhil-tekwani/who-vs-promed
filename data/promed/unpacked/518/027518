1st report of _Monilinia fructicola_ on peach and nectarine in China
----------------------------------------------
X.Q. Zhu, Department of Plant Pathology, China Agricultural University,
Beijing 100094, China; X.Y. Chen, Beijing Plant Protection Station, Beijing
100029, China; Y. Luo, Department of Plant Pathology, University of
California, Kearney Agricultural Center, Parlier, CA 93648, USA; and L.Y.
Guo (<ppguo@cau.edu.cn>; as for Zhu). Accepted for publication 5 Jan 2005.
In 2003 and 2004, peach and nectarine fruit showing typical brown rot
symptoms were found in an orchard in a suburb of Beijing, China. The
pathogen was identified as _Monilinia fructicola_ [Mf] based on
morphological and molecular approaches. Mycelia grew at a linear rate of
7.8 mm per day on potato dextrose agar (PDA) at 25 deg C, forming a greyish
colony with heavy sporulation showing concentric rings. The conidia were
1-celled, hyaline, lemon-shaped, 15.0 (17.5-11.3) x 10.4 (12.5-9.8)
micrometers on PDA, produced in branched, monilioid chains.
Species-specific ITS primers for Mf, _M. laxa_ and _M. fructigena_ and a
Mf-specific microsatellite primer were used to amplify the genomic DNA of
these isolates. Sub-clones of the respective ITS regions from each of 3
standard cultures were used as the positive control. A DNA fragment of
approximately 350 bp was amplified by the ITS-specific primer for Mf, but
no products were obtained using the primers for the other 2 species; a
468-bp DNA fragment was amplified using Ma's Mf-specific primer.
Pathogenicity was tested by inoculating surface-sterilised, mature
nectarine fruit with a droplet of spore suspension (5000 spores/ ml) from
an isolate. Fruit inoculated with 5 ml of sterile water were used as
controls. Inoculated fruit were placed in a sterilised plastic container at
room temperature (21-26 deg C). 6 fruit were used in each of 2 replicated
tests. About 50 percent inoculated fruit developed typical brown rot
symptom after 4 days of incubation, while all the control fruit remained
healthy. Mf was re-isolated from these inoculated fruit.
Brown rot of stone fruit is commonly caused by one of the 3 _Monilinia_
species. It was still not clear which is the major causal pathogen of stone
fruit in China. Although occurrence of _Monilinia laxa_ on peach in China
had been documented, this is the 1st report about the occurrence of Mf on
stone fruit in China.

[Brown rot [BR] caused by Mf is a destructive disease of peach and other
stone fruits (plum, nectarine, apricot, and cherry), affecting blossoms,
fruit, spurs, and small branches. BR is most important on fruits just
before ripening and during and after harvest. Under favorable conditions
for disease development, the entire crop can be completely rotted. Peaches
not kept in cool storage may rot in 2 to 3 days. Disease management
involves use of phytosanitary measures (removal and destruction of rotted
fruit, mummies, and neglected trees as possible inoculum sources); pruning
of cankers during the dormant season; and insect control to avoid insects
that feed on punctured or bruised fruit in the orchard or during harvesting
and packing. Fruit should be cooled and refrigerated (as close to 0 C as
possible) immediately after harvest.
