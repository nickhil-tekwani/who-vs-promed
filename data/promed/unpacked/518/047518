[1] Cholera - Nepal (Mid Western Region)

The causative agent of cholera, _Vibrio cholerae_, has been detected
in stool samples collected from Jajarkot district where more than 150
persons died of diarrhea in recent weeks.

When 5 suspected samples were subjected to laboratory test in
Kathmandu following the Ministry of Health and Population directives,
the cholera causing bacterium was detected in 3.

Though it was believed that cholera was eradicated from Nepal, the
disease broke out in Saptari in 2007. Since then it has been endemic
in the country.

For confirmation, the stool samples are collected and sent to the
National Public Health Laboratory (NPHL) in Teku for laboratory
confirmation.

[2] Diarrhea, fatal - Nepal (Mid Western Region)

More than 200 people have died in a diarrhea epidemic in Western
Nepal, the most remote and poorest region of the country, which has
spread unchecked for over 2 months. Rukum, Rolpa, Surkhet, Jajarkot
districts are most affected by the epidemic. In these areas the lack
of adequate roads and hospitals are adding to a rapid spread of the
disease. Dozens of people are infected every day in the villages. In
many cases the bodies of dead lie in the fields contaminating the
waterways. A considerable increase [in the number] of the victims is
expected in the coming months.

Despite the fact that the 1st deaths occurred about 3 months ago, the
government is only now intervening to stop the spread of the epidemic
to the rest of the country. After an initial visit, Mon 20 Jul 2009,
the Prime Minister Madhav Kumar assured the people declaring to have
taken special measures to tackle the epidemic quickly. He
acknowledged the responsibilities of institutions stating that "this
situation is due to a lack of coordination of the competent
authorities."

Meanwhile, the younger population is fleeing from the affected
districts for fear of contagion, leaving the elderly alone in the
villages.

[3] Cholera - India (Mumbai)

A day after a cholera case was confirmed in the city [Mumbai], 3 more
patients from GT Hospital, CST, were reportedly transferred to
Kasturba Hospital for Infectious Diseases on Tuesday [21 Jul 2009] on
suspicion of the water-borne ailment.

BMC [Mumbai Municipal Corporation] executive health officer Jairaj
Thanekar, however, said, "There are no more positive cases and no
more patients have been transferred."

Meanwhile, civic health officials who had been sticking to their "no
more cholera patients" line admitted that some of the water samples
collected from the Ambedkar. Nagar slum in Colaba were "unfit for
drinking. 3 of the 10 water samples drawn from the area were unfit
for consumption and showed the presence of the _E. coli_ bacteria. 2
of the "unfit" samples were from Shaparji while one was from Dhobi
Ghat [a broad flight of steps leading down to the bank of a river],"
said Thanekar.

The slum had drawn attention after patients landed up in hospitals
with diarrhea and vomiting. One of them, a 35-year-old woman, was
confirmed to be suffering from cholera. Civic officials from the
water department blamed the contamination on the tanker water supply.
On Tuesday [21 Jul 2009], health workers fanned out across the slum
and screened 4000 people in Shaparji and another 1152 in Dhobi ghat,
besides stepping up chlorination in the area.

Some 27 residents of the Burundian capital, Bujumbura, have been
hospitalized for cholera, medical sources told PANA here Mon 20 Jul
2009. According to the doctor of the municipal health centre in
Bujumbura, Pascal Nday ongeje, a new case from Buyenzi, a popular
neighborhood in the city centre, was detected Mon 20 Jul 2009.

Cholera broke out 11 Jul 2009 in 3 neighborhoods in the northern part
of Bujumbura, and has since spread to other areas. No deaths have so
far been recorded. The high prevalence of diarrheal diseases in the
popular neighborhoods in Bujumbura has been blamed on poor sanitation
and lack of potable water, among others.

[6] Diarrhea, fatal - Uganda (Busia)

Strange disease hits Busia, Uganda
----------------------------------
Experts from the health ministry are in Busia town to investigate a
strange disease that has hit the area. The disease, which has
symptoms similar to those of cholera, broke out in Soloa, Arubaine,
Marachi A and B, and Mugungu villages. 7 people, including 2
children, died after suffering from severe diarrhoea and vomiting.
Over 20 others were admitted at Samia-Bugwe North Health Centre IV.

Dr George Oundo Bwire, the district health officer, said some of the
patients had been discharged. "I cannot, therefore, say there is a
cholera outbreak," Oundo said.

The Arubaine and Marachi leaders blamed the disease on the
Busia-Kenya sewage system, which they said had overflowed into the
village wells. They said residents started falling sick when the
sewage started flooding. Oundo said an isolation centre had been
created at the health centre, adding that some patients who were at
the health centre before the outbreak, discharged themselves fearing
that they would contract the disease.

He appealed to residents to report any suspected cases. However, some
of the patients said they had eaten cassava and chapattis from
Arubaine market.

One of the patients, a Marachi B resident, said he developed the
symptoms 8 hours after he drunk water packed in kaveera (polyethylene
bag).
