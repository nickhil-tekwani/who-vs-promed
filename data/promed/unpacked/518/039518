Heavy rain threatens Ivorian cocoa mid crop
-------------------------------------------
Persistent heavy rainfall in some Ivorian cocoa growing regions last
week [week of 4 May 2009], after several weeks of humid conditions,
increased the risk of black pod disease outbreaks in cocoa
plantations, farmers and analysts said. Black pod disease, which
thrives in the wet, blighted the October-March [2008-2009] main crop
in the world's biggest grower.

In the western region of Soubre, at the heart of the cocoa belt,
100.5 mm [4 in] of rain fell last week, analysts said, compared with
14 mm [0.5 in] in the same period last year [2008]. "It rained
heavily all week and that's too much," said Desire Gnali, who farms
near Soubre. "If it continues diseases will come back, and we'll have
less cocoa to harvest just like in the main crop," he said. In the
western region of Gagnoa farmers reported similar weather, adding
that heavy rains could knock off cocoa pods and flowers from the
trees, reducing the size of the crop.

In the centre-western region of Daloa, farmers said abundant rains
were mixed with spells of sunshine, a much healthier mix for the
development of the April-September [2009] mid-crop. Good growing
conditions were also reported in the southern regions of Divo,
Aboisso, and Agboville, in the coastal regions of Sassandra and San
Pedro, in the central region of Yamoussoukro and in the eastern
region of Abengourou.

[Black pod (also called _Phytophthora_ pod rot) is the primary fungal
disease affecting cocoa worldwide since the 1920s. Pathogens
associated with this disease are: _Phytophthora palmivora_ found
worldwide; _P. megakarya_ found in several West African countries; a
species closely resembling, but possibly different from, _P. capsici_
found in parts of the Americas; and _P. citrophthora_, a more
virulent, but relatively rare species identified in Brazil.

_P. palmivora_ is the most common pathogen and can cause yield losses
as high as 95 percent in very humid climates, with every pod
affected. It attacks all parts of the plant at all stages of the
growing cycle and is estimated to kill up to 10 percent of trees
annually through stem cankers. Pod symptoms start with a small spot,
which progressively turns darker brown and expands rapidly over the
whole pod. Losses are most severe when pods are infected during the 2
months prior to ripening.

Black pod is spread by insects, mechanical means, plant debris,
water, and wind. Multiple infections from several sources may occur
in plantations with epiphytotics developing from a series of foci.
Furthermore, genetic resistance is generally low in commercial cocoa
cultivars. Consequently, disease management is difficult and needs an
integrated approach, including cultural techniques, phytosanitary
measures, and targeted fungicide use.

Cocoa trees produce 2 harvests per year, the main crop in
October-March and the (usually smaller) midcrop in April-September.
Concerns over the spread of black pod were raised in Ivory Coast
before the 2008-2009 main crop (ProMED-mail post 20080828.2699).
