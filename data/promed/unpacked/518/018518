Multiple inmates have tested positive for hepatitis A at the Madison County Jail. The Madison County Sheriff's Office confirmed that 5 inmates were placed in quarantine. The Alabama Department of Public Health will go to the jail Wednesday [17 Nov 2021] to offer hepatitis [A] vaccines to inmates.

According to the CDC, hepatitis A is very contagious. It is spread through close personal contact with an infected person or through eating contaminated food or drink. Symptoms of hepatitis A include fatigue, nausea, stomach pain, and jaundice. Hepatitis A can be prevented with a vaccine.

[The timeline of the outbreak is not stated but if all 5 cases were diagnosed over a week or so, then there is a single, presumably food, source of these cases. During the incubation period of hepatitis A, there is a short viremic phase so it is possible that shared illicit drug use could be responsible. With an incubation period for 15-45 days or so, averaging about 28 days, secondary cases can occur in close contacts. Postexposure use of the hepatitis A virus (HAV) vaccine can prevent cases.

Alabama is one of the states reporting in the multistate outbreak of HAV in a cohort primarily homeless and substance abusing related. In the last CDC update (https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/outbreaks/2017March-HepatitisA.htm), Alabama through 21 Oct 2021 reported 1607 cases with 69% being hospitalized and no deaths.

"Madison County is located in the north-central portion of the state of Alabama. As of the 2020 Census, the population was 388 153, making it the 3rd-most populous county in Alabama. Its county seat is Huntsville" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_County,_Alabama). - Mod.LL
