WHO Influenza update 158
------------------------
Influenza virus activity in the world
-------------------------------------
Based on FluNet reporting (as of 24 Apr 2012), during weeks 14 to 15 (01 Apr 2012 to 14 Apr 2012), National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 78 countries, areas or territories reported data. The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 28 664 specimens. 6096 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 4477 (73.4 per cent) were typed as influenza A and 1619 (26.6 per cent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 569 (18.6 per cent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 2481 (81.3 per cent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 197 (69.4 per cent) belong to the B-Yamagata lineage and 87 (30.6 per cent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

Summary
-------
During weeks 14 and 15 in 2012, laboratory confirmed influenza activity continued to decrease in the northern hemisphere. Influenza A(H3N2) remained the predominant virus subtype detected globally. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus activity was low in general with the exception of India where regional outbreaks of this virus subtype were reported. Influenza B virus continued to be the main virus detected in Canada and the Republic of Korea. Globally the proportion of influenza B viruses belonging to the B-Yamagata lineage compared to the B-Victoria lineage viruses have steadily increased over the past few weeks.

In Europe, the number of virus detections declined. Influenza A(H3N2) continued to predominate with co-circulation of influenza B virus in some countries and sporadic detections of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses.

In North America, influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B remained the predominant virus subtype in the United States of America and Canada respectively. In Central America, A(H1N1)pdm09 was the main circulating virus subtype in several countries while influenza A(H3N2) virus detections increased in the Dominican Republic.

In Asia, influenza A(H3N2) and B viruses co-circulated in China, Japan, and a number of other countries.

In the Middle East, Qatar continued to report A(H1N1)pdm09 as the predominant virus subtype but at low levels.

In the southern hemisphere, influenza activity continued to be low with the majority of the sporadic virus detections identified as influenza A(H3N2).

[The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has summarised the main surveillance developments in week 16/2012 (16-22 Apr 2012) from a European perspective as follows.

"The 2011-2012 season influenza season started late and has been without any clear geographic progression across Europe. There are indications that transmission has been declining since around week 9/2012. The following points are noteworthy in week 16/2012:
-- Almost all reporting countries experienced low-intensity influenza activity and reported decreasing or stable trends.
-- During week 16/2012, 24.1 percent of 315 sentinel specimens tested were positive for influenza virus, thus continuing the downward trend observed since week 8/2012.
-- The absolute number of detected influenza viruses is decreasing, but the proportion of B viruses has increased substantially since earlier in the season.
-- Of the SARI [severe acute respiratory infection] cases reported during week 16/2012, 2 were confirmed to be related to type A influenza virus infection, and one was sub-typed as A(H3).

"The 2011-2012 season is now drawing to a close. However, although decreasing, the percentage of influenza-positive specimens and the epidemiological trends show that influenza viruses are still circulating in a number of EU countries."
