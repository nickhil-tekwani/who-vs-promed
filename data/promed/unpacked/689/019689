A rare form of [human] tuberculosis [TB] due to _Mycobacterium bovis_
has emerged and has been traced to illegal, unpasteurized dairy
products, including tainted 'queso fresco' cheese. The outbreak is
rising among Hispanic immigrants in Southern California and is also
raising fears about a revival of this strain that was nearly
completely destroyed in the USA in the 1900s.

The increase in this TB is being seen chiefly in San Diego,
particularly among children who drink or eat dairy foods made from
the milk of infected cattle, but _Mycobacterium bovis_ TB can infect
anyone who eats contaminated fresh cheeses sold by street vendors,
smuggled across the Mexican border, or produced as so-called "bathtub
cheese" made in home tubs and backyard troughs. The problem
originates from cattle in Mexico, where _M. bovis_ infects about 17
percent of herds; occasional outbreaks among isolated herds affect
the USA.

This rare TB accounts for about 10 percent of all new TB cases in the
California border region. "_M. bovis_ TB is a disease of antiquity,"
said Timothy Rodwell, a researcher who led a study published by the
federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). "It is
important that it not be allowed to re-emerge as a cause of TB in
this country."

Unfortunately, this species is uniformly resistant to one of the
front line anti-TB drugs [pyrazinamide]. Adults who contract _M.
bovis_ TB are more than twice as likely as those with traditional TB
to die before completing treatment.

Researchers analyzed nearly 3300 culture-confirmed cases of TB in San
Diego between 1994-2005. Approximately 265 were identified as due to
_M. bovis_; this increased by nearly 65 percent, rising from 17 to 28
cases annually. By 2005, over half the _M. bovis_ cases were diagnosed
in children under 15. The majority were in Hispanics, 60 percent from
Mexico. Between 2001-2005, 19 adults with _M. bovis_ died before or
during treatment. Dr. Kathleen Moser, director of TB control programs
for San Diego County, said: "It's clearly being seen in places where
people drink unpasteurized milk and eat unpasteurized dairy products."

In California, 108 million pounds of legal, properly pasteurized
'queso fresco' and other cheeses were produced last year [2007],
according to the California Department of Food and Agriculture. Last
year, Moser launched a public health campaign, and agricultural
officials seized over 375 pounds of "bathtub cheese" from an open-air
market in San Bernardino, according to Steve Lyle, the agency's
director of public affairs. Such illegal cheeses have been infected
with _Salmonella_, _Listeria_, _Escherichia coli_, and _M. bovis_.

Rodwell cautioned that people worried about _M. bovis_ TB should pay
close attention to dairy products, not people. "It is not a disease
you are very likely to get from a foreign-born person," he said. "The
increase in _M. bovis_ cases is more about what you eat, not where
you were born."

[_Mycobacterium bovis_ is a member of the "_Mycobacterium
tuberculosis_ complex," which is composed of the closely related
species _M. tuberculosis_ (the usual cause of tuberculosis in
humans), _M. bovis_ (the usual cause of bovine tuberculosis), _M.
bovis-BCG, _M. microti_ (a pathogen in rodents), and _M. canetti_ and
_M. africanum_ (both rare causes of tuberculosis in Africa). _M.
bovis_ can be distinguished from _M. tuberculosis_ by specific gene
probes (the standard nucleic acid amplification assay only identifies
the organism as a member of the "_M. tuberculosis_ complex"), colony
morphology and specific biochemical assays (_M. bovis_ does not
produce niacin or reduce nitrate), and intrinsic monodrug resistance
to pyrazinamide among _M. bovis_.

_M. bovis_ can cause disease in a wide variety of domestic and wild
animals, including cattle, goats, sheep, deer, badgers, as well as
humans. In humans, consumption of unpasteurized milk products from
infected animals is thought to be a common source of infection;
however, human-to-human, airborne transmission from patients with _M.
bovis_ pulmonary tuberculosis is also thought to be possible (Lobue
PA, et al. Int J Tuberc Lung Dis 2004; 8: 868-72).

Accurate speciation of isolates from clinical specimens is important
for epidemiologic and clinical reasons. However, very frequently, a
clinical isolate is only identified as "_M. tuberculosis_ complex,"
and pyrazinamide resistance is not routinely performed. In such
circumstances, the standard 6-month, short-course combination drug
therapy for TB, which includes pyrazinamide, is likely to fail, as
the 6-month, short-course regimen depends on the rapid bactericidal
action of pyrazinamide; without this drug as part of the initial
regimen, therapy must be prolonged beyond 6 months.

Human infection caused by _M. bovis_ has been mostly, but not
completely, eradicated in the USA by the use of pasteurization of milk
and culling of herds shown positive on tuberculin skin testing,
starting in about 1917. _M. bovis_ human infection continues to be
reported in the USA, primarily in immigrants from countries where
bovine tuberculosis remains endemic and where many presumably acquired
their infection. Bovine tuberculosis is endemic in Latin America as
well as Mexico (Milian F, et al. Rev Latinoam Microbiol. 2000;
42:13-9), and _M. bovis_ is a well-recognized cause of tuberculosis in
Southern California in the Hispanic community. For example, in San
Diego, California during 1980-97, 34 percent of culture-confirmed TB
cases in children aged less than 15 years were caused by _M. bovis_;
about 90 percent of these children were USA-born and of Hispanic
ethnicity; fresh cheese brought in from Mexico was suspected to be one
source of infection in these children (Dankner WM, et al. Medicine
1993; 72: 11-37)[see ProMED references below. - Mod.JW].

People of Hispanic ethnicity and consumption of unpasteurized milk
products produced in Latin America are not restricted to states of
the USA bordering Mexico. A recent investigation in New York City
identified 35 cases of tuberculosis due to _M. bovis_ during 2001-4;
19 of the 23 interviewed patients reported eating cheese produced in
Mexico while they were living in the USA:
<http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/507311_print>.
In this investigation, of the 35 isolates, 14 were resistant to
streptomycin, one was resistant to INH, and 2 were resistant to INH
and streptomycin, in addition to being resistant to pyrazinamide.
Thus, accurate speciation of clinical isolates identified as "_M.
tuberculosis_ complex" and drug susceptibility testing are important
throughout the country. - Mod.ML
