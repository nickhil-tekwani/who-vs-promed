It perhaps useful to remember that the great imitator of leptospirosis in all aspects, clinical and epidemiological, is hantavirus infection, particularly if induced by Seoul virus (SEOV), which happens to be spread also by the wild rat, the main reservoir for both pathogens (1), even in urban areas (2). If in India leptospirosis appears "grossly under-reported, because of lack of awareness about it among medical professionals, and difficulties in diagnosis," this is probably even more the case for hantavirus infections, heavily underreported so far in India.

Both zoonoses present, often in outbreaks after floods, with flu-like fever, acute kidney injury (AKI), liver involvement ("transaminitis"), proteinuria together with microscopic haematuria, and, most importantly, varying degrees of thrombocytopenia, which can serve as a severity indicator (3, 4). Thus, infection with SEOV commonly leads to AKI combined with transaminitis, including jaundice in severe cases, making the diagnosis on clinical grounds alone virtually impossible, particularly since both illnesses show self-remittance within 2 to 3 weeks, without sequelae (5).

In 2006, we found, in line immuno assay and ELISA, evidence for acute murine SEOV-like infection in 12 percent of patients from the Cochin and Chennai area of India, considered as presenting with leptospirosis with typical symptoms. However, this common zoonosis was serologically excluded in our hands. Moreover, in 5 percent of these Indian cases, serologic evidence of an acute arvicoline PUUV-like infection was found, leading to 2 fatalities with severe AKI and ARDS, needing both emergency dialysis and mechanical ventilation (6).

Arvicoline hantaviral pathogens are absent in India, so the serological results in these 1st hantavirus-induced fatalities of the Indian subcontinent have to be interpreted as cross-reactions. Repeated invitations since 2006 to Indian dialysis centra and virological laboratories to send fresh serum samples for hantavirus (and leptospirosis) confirmation of similar clinical cases remained unanswered so far.

In 1999, A. Ko et al. reported an urban epidemic of severe leptospirosis after flooding in Salvador, Brazil (7). Serological confirmation of a leptospira infection was found, however, in only about a maximum of 50 percent of the involved cases, as so often in most leptospirosis outbreaks worldwide after floods, even with gold standard techniques, and even in the best hands (8). Consequently, one can wonder which other pathogen might occur worldwide, appearing frequently after inundations, and is able to mimic leptospirosis almost to perfection. Amongst the 1999 Salvador cases, not confirmed for being a leptospira infection, at least a few were shown later to be in fact SEOV-induced (non-published observations).

The 1st (1993) report of clinically documented human hantavirus infection in the New World was in a patient series, presenting with the same symptoms, once again reported after heavy rainfall with flooding in 1990 and in Recife, also an urban centre in Brazil, north of Salvador. There, 8 patients with a SEOV-like reaction pattern, but negative for leptospirosis, were found in serological testing of 144 patients (156 samples) with suspected leptospirosis (9).

Finally, even a seroconfirmed case of leptospirosis does not automatically exclude a concomitant hantavirus infection, SEOV-induced or not. In 201 sera from Belem, Brazil, considered as having leptospirosis, 99/201 (49 percent) were indeed seroconfirmed in a Patoc IgM ELISA test. Of these, 4/99 (4 percent) were also IgM positive for hantavirus, suggesting a recent dual infection. Of the latter, in at least one patient, definite SEOV hantavirus infection was confirmed by a high titer (1/320) in ultra-specific focus reduction neutralisation testing (10). Dual concomitant acute infections with both leptospira and hantavirus IgM seropositivity have recently been demonstrated in Sri Lanka, a tropical country highly endemic for leptospirosis (11), and even in Belgium, a temperate climate country with low endemicity for autochthonous leptospirosis (12).

In conclusion, in India and elsewhere, it would be a prudent policy to screen from now on leptospirosis-suspected cases for concomitant or isolated hantavirus infection also, since antibiotics are not warranted in treatment of the latter, and can cause in turn transaminitis, thus further complicating the clinical picture.

[Dr. Clement and colleagues are thanked for sending in these comments.

Dr. Clement and colleagues raise an important point about the clinical similarity (indistinguishability) of leptospirosis and Seoul hantavirus infections. Their emphasis on the need to include tests for SEOV infection in cases clinically or even laboratory diagnosed as leptospirosis is compelling. Dr. Clement has pointed out in previous comments that hantavirus infections do occur in India. He pointed out that at least 10 serologically confirmed prior cases occurred in the Mumbai region in 2016. For all these prior cases, however, including the current 11th pediatric and fatal case in Mumbai, the exact infecting hantaviral pathogen was hitherto never specified. Hantavirus infections have been reported sporadically in several states in India, including Maharashtra (see archived posts below).

Indian health authorities may wish to take advantage of Dr. Clement's offer to test samples from cases diagnosed as leptospirosis. - Mod.TY]
