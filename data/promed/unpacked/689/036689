Via: APHIS Press Release: USDA Proposes to Allow Importation of Citrus from
Argentine Areas <http://www.press_releases@info.aphis.usda.gov>

WASHINGTON, Aug. 11, 1998--The U.S. Department of Agriculture is proposing
to amend the citrus fruit regulations by recognizing a citrus-growing area
in Argentina as free from citrus canker.
"This proposed rule would allow the importation of fresh citrus from
Argentina under certain conditions," said Alfred S. Elder, deputy
administrator of plant protection and quarantine with the Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service, a part of USDA's marketing and regulatory
programs area.
APHIS has reviewed surveys conducted by the Servicio Nacional de Sanidad y
Calidad Agroalimentaria (SENASA), Argentina's plant protection
organization, and concluded that the northwestern Argentine states of
Catamarca, Jujuy, Salta, and Tucuman are free of citrus canker.
Under this proposed rule, grapefruit, lemons, and oranges from these states
could be imported into the United States under certain conditions. The
citrus diseases, sweet orange scab and citrus black spot are present in
Argentina, as well as Mediterranean and _Anastrepha_ species of fruit
flies. To prevent these pests from entering the United States, APHIS would
require that all export groves be:
--Registered with SENASA's citrus fruit export program;
--Enclosed by a 150-meter buffer area that separates export fruit from
neighboring agricultural and nonagricultural areas;
--Treated and sanitized to protect against citrus black spot and sweet
orange scab;
--Inspected by SENASA at specified times for signs of infected or infested
fruit; and
--Cold treated for fruit flies as a condition of entry.
APHIS would require citrus from these four canker-free states to be
accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate issued by SENASA to verify
compliance with the program.
"These importation conditions are designed to prevent plant pests and
diseases from being introduced into the United States," said Elder.
For more information, contact Ronald Campbell, import specialist,
phytosanitary issues management team, PPQ, APHIS, USDA 4700 River Road
Unit 140, Riverdale, Md. 20737-1236, (301) 734-6799; or e-mail him at
