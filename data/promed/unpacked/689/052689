At least 8 people died, and scores of others have been admitted in
hospitals following a cholera outbreak in a district of northwestern
Pakistan, health authorities said Sunday [5 Jul 2009]. The private
NNI news agency quoted Dr. Muhammad Aslam, executive health officer
of the Dera Ismail Khan district, as saying that a team of doctors
had been sent to the area with vaccines, and the health department
was ready to face the challenge, adding that more vaccination would
be sent to the area if needed.

Aslam said that about 800 locals of the Naivela Union Council of the
Dera Ismail Khan district had not received vaccination due to
shortage of vaccine. He added that the reason behind the outbreak was
unhygienic water and scorching heat.

In most parts of the Dera Ismail Khan district, power remains
suspended for nearly 14 to 16 hours, and tube wells in the area are
also closed, locals residents were quoted as saying. The NNI said
that the residents complained that they were compelled to drink
polluted water and feared that cholera could break out in other parts
of the district.

light over the past few days. Though local authorities said medical
teams have been dispatched to the affected areas, the diarrhea
epidemic has worsened.

[5] Diarrhea, fatal - Indonesia (West Sulawesi)

Diarrhea has spread rapidly in Polewali Mandar (Polman) regency,
killing at least 9 people in the past 2 weeks. The Polman Health
Agency recorded 1200 cases of diarrhea in the regency, forcing it to
declare an emergency situation in Luyo district, which had 396 cases
with 5 fatalities.

"Most victims were sent too late to the hospital for medical
treatment," agency head Ayub Ali said Friday [12 Jun 2009]. He said
besides Luyo, diarrhea was also prevalent in other districts,
including Mapilli, Campalagian and Wonomulyo.

From October to December 2008, the agency recorded 2800 cases of
diarrhea in the districts, with 28 people succumbing to the disease.

Ayub said his agency had conducted several activities to prevent the
disease from spreading, such as opening medical posts, providing
medical treatment, chlorinating residents' wells and advising people
on healthy living. "The problem is residents are still consuming
contaminated river water. It's difficult to chlorinate the river."

Meanwhile, head of disease control at the Polman Health Agency
Hartini said diarrhea was on the rise due to the unhealthy habits of
the residents, such as drinking water that had been taken from river
or wells without boiling it first.

[7] Cholera, prison - Swaziland (Lubombo)

Following reports of a cholera outbreak in Big Bend prison, acting
commissioner of correctional services Isaiah Ntshangase has visited
the centre on a health assessment mission. In a brief interview
yesterday [6 Jul 2009], Ntshangase said 10 people at Big Bend prison
have been diagnosed with cholera. Six of these are prison officers,
while the remaining are inmates. The number of people to have
contracted cholera at the prison has just recently shot up. Just
recently, only 4 correctional staffers had been positively identified
as having the disease, while 2 inmates had been diagnosed.

Currently, a tanker is used for water supply at the prison instead of
running water, and this has raised concern that the use of portable
instead of running water may further exacerbate the situation.

A 5-year-old child has died of cholera in an outbreak in Mndobandoba
and Mahlabaneni areas, Minister of Health Bennedict Xaba revealed.
Eight new cases have been reported in the area, bringing to 16 the
number of reported cases.

Addressing Members of Parliament in the House of Assembly, the
Minister said although they were yet to undertake further tests at
Mbabane Government Hospital on the child's issue, preliminary results
from Good Shepherd Hospital were that cholera was the cause of death.

"It was found that residents source their water from the nearby Great
Usuthu River, which is contaminated. We're presently working hard to
provide a clean water supply to Bholi Clinic, being used by the
community and generally the whole of Nkilongo constituency," he said.

The number of Kenyans who have died since the start of 2009 in a
cholera outbreak has risen to 89, the Red Cross Society said on
Wednesday [8 Jul 2009], warning water shortages could spread the
disease to Nairobi.

Kenya Red Cross Society spokesperson Titus Mungou said that since the
1st case was reported in the western Nyanza province in late December
2008, a total of 4000 cases and 89 deaths were confirmed. He added
that water shortages across the country had led many people,
including in the capital, to buy water, often from unreliable sources.
