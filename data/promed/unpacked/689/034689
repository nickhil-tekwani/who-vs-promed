While I find plenty of interesting stuff to read on ProMED-mail (Yes, this
is a testimonial), I was peaked by this posting as I took my veterinary
pathology Masters of Science thesis in spontaneous and experimental canine
distemper (CD) virus in raccoons and have continued to study this disease
in raccoons all over the US for the past 15 years.
What is described in this press report is not at all unusual, especially in
the Midwest and Northeast. It can be said without exaggeration that east of
the Mississippi CD is endemic in raccoon populations, especially those in
urban areas. Endemic raccoon CD has been demonstrated in Northern
California in the past 5 years. I should not leave out our Canadian
brothers (Ontario) who have had significant problems with CD in raccoons
for many years now. I have corresponded with German veterinarians in the
Black Forest Region of Germany where local sporadic outbreaks have been
noted in their transplanted raccoons. Remember, we traded some of our
masked devils to Germany prior to W.W.II and they have escaped and
established themselves in the wild.
If one investigates closely, each year, small to moderate sized, local to
wide spread sporadic outbreaks are noted. As an example, over the last 15
years I have recorded over 600 of these in 17 states in the Midwest,
Northeast, Southeast and Northern California. Epidemics involving hundreds
of raccoons have also been recorded on 5-8 year cycles. My thesis work in
the late '70s and early '80 serves as an example in which I confirmed CDV
infection in over 800 raccoons in a 7 month long outbreak in the St. Louis,
Missouri area. It should be stressed that despite press statements that
raccoon populations are destroyed permanently, they do recover quite well,
frequently as soon as the following year.
Epidemiological studies relate sporadic and epidemic outbreaks to raccoon
population densities ("when they peak, they die") and age distributions as
well as proximity to urban areas (source of virus = domestic dogs) among
other factors . Outbreaks have been documented from late spring through
early winter, when the greatest proportion of susceptible individuals
occurs (juveniles), but are most notable from late summer through the fall
when juveniles are dispersing and spreading the disease. There is an
association with late winter when males are out carousing for partners to
mate. I have noted in urban areas that during this period males frequently
make contact with domestic dogs, probably the source of the virus and may
go tromping along as a "Typhoid Martins". Over the past few years in our
county (highly urbanized with large populations of raccoons, opossums,
coyotes and skunks) we have established a good solid link between urban
areas with significant backyard wildlife feeding by residents and small
local outbreaks of CD. Not very surprising or difficult to reason why I am
afraid.
Juvenile raccoons are highly susceptible to CDV infection. In my
experimental studies placing a clinical raccoon kit between 10-14 weeks in
with a litter of healthy age matched raccoons resulted in a 98-100 percent
infection and clinical disease rate. The outcome was invariably fatal.
However, recoveries were noted with upwards of 80percent of these
developing "Old Dog Encephalitis"-like neurological disease weeks to months
following initial recovery.
I found it very difficult to produce disease in susceptible raccoons
without fairly close, often intimate contact. I tried smearing the facial
fur of several individuals with infectious nasal secretions but got an
asymptomatic infection in less then 10 percent of cases (as judged by lack
of disease and antibody response). I did note that it could be transmitted
when one juvenile (especially males) meets another and they start
"displaying" and snorting. I even tracked the snorted nasal secretions over
4-6 feet after getting juveniles to "display" against a movie screen
showing another "displaying" raccoon. Inanimate objects (empty feed or
water bowls, cage furniture), if anointed with a good slug of nasal
secretion did result in infection and disease in about 50 percent of cases,
but contact had to be made with the secretions within 1 hour. Inoculating
food (dried dog kibble) or water with secretions, elicited an antibody
response without disease in only 1 of 15 cases.
I have found significant amounts of virus in nasal, oropharyngeal fluids.
Despite seeing inclusion bodies in the Gastrointestinal tract I have been
unable to detect virus in feces, contrary to this report that raccoon
droppings carry the virus. It has been found in the urine, but I doubt
seriously whether in amounts sufficient to result in infection.
The clinical picture of CD in raccoons is very similar to that of dogs, but
usually with quite bizarre neurological disease being much more common. In
fact, in my table of the most commonly observed clinical signs,
neurological disease rates an 85 percent. Lack of fear of humans, stumbling
drunken like wandering gait, the thousand yard stare, facial spasms and
convulsions top the list. For this reason it is very difficult to
distinguish this disease from rabies as noted by our moderator. I have even
been fooled on several instances on the eastern seaboard where rabies is
endemic in raccoons. Dual infections with CD and rabies have also been
recorded in these areas.In the zoonotic arena, I have recorded a
significant number of CD infected raccoons with cryptospoidiosis, probably
the result of the immunosuppressive activity of CDV infection.
