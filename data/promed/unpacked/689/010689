Larimer County [Colorado] is warning about an outbreak of tularemia among wild rabbits.

Health officials said tularemia is a bacterial infection most commonly transmitted to humans by the handling of sick or dead animals infected with tularemia. Humans can also get infected if they are bit by an infected tick or deer fly, by eating or drinking contaminated food or water, and by inhaling airborne bacteria.

The Larimer County Department of Health and Environment issued an alert to residents of Hahn Acres, Linden Park, Paragon Estates, and homes in the Paragon Point subdivision along Southridge Greens Blvd. after a wild rabbit was found with tularemia.

"There has been a die-off of rabbits in the area over the past few weeks, but until an animal was tested today, the cause of the die-off was unknown," officials said.

Typical signs of infection in humans are fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, chest pain, and coughing. Eating or drinking food or water containing the bacteria may produce a throat infection, stomach pain, diarrhea and vomiting. Officials said tularemia can be effectively treated with antibiotics.

Dogs and cats also get tularemia by eating infected rabbits or other rodents and through tick and deer fly bites. If your pet shows symptoms of illness including fever, nasal and eye discharge, and skin sores, take it to the veterinarian promptly.

[The causative bacterium, _Francisella tularensis_, is a non sporulating, Gram negative coccobacillus that is antigenically related to _Brucella_ spp. It is a facultative intracellular parasite that is killed rapidly by heat and proper disinfection but survives for weeks or months in a moist environment. It is fastidious in growth but can be cultured readily. There are 2 types of organisms based on their biochemistry and virulence. Type A has been found predominantly in North America and is more virulent; in people, the mortality rate may be 5-7 per cent if untreated. Type B is less virulent and is most commonly isolated from aquatic animals and water-associated infections in North America and Eurasia. Both types have been isolated from arthropod vectors.

In domestic animals, sheep are the primary hosts, but clinical infection has been reported in dogs, pigs, and horses. Cats are at increased risk due to predatory behavior and appear to have an increased susceptibility, while cattle appear to be resistant. Little is known of the true incidence and spectrum of clinical disease in domestic animals. Important wild animal hosts include cottontail and jackrabbits, beavers, muskrats, meadow voles, and sheep in North America, and other voles, field mice, and lemmings in Europe and Asia.

Tularemia is a classic zoonosis, capable of being transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (as in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with or ingestion of infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbits) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional inflammation of a lymph node), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially and transovarially [Transstadial transmission occurs when a pathogen remains with the vector from one life stage ("stadium") to the next. Transovarial or transovarian transmission occurs in certain arthropod vectors as they transmit disease-causing bacteria from parent arthropod to offspring arthropod. - CopyEd.MSP], which makes them an efficient reservoir as well as a vector. Recognized vectors in the USA include _Dermacentor andersoni_ (wood tick), _Amblyomma americanum_ (lone star tick), _Dermacentor variabilis_ (dog tick), and _Chrysops discalis_ (deer fly).

The commonest source of infection for people and herbivores is the bite of an infected tick, but persons who dress, prepare, or eat improperly cooked wild game are also at increased risk. Dogs, cats, and other carnivores may acquire infection from ingestion of an infected carcass. A few case reports have implicated cats as a source of infection in people. Bites from cats may transmit the disease to people.

The incubation period is 1-10 days. In sheep and most mammals including hares and rabbits, the disease is characterized by sudden onset of high fever, lethargy, anorexia, stiffness, reduced mobility, or other signs associated with septicemic disease. Pulse and respiratory rates are increased. Coughing, diarrhea, and pollakiuria [abnormally frequent urination] may develop. Prostration and death may occur in a few hours or days. Sporadic cases are best recognized by signs of septicemia. Outbreaks in untreated lambs may have up to 15 percent mortality. Subclinical cases may be common.

People may develop different clinical signs of the disease depending on how they are exposed to tularemia. Possible symptoms include skin ulcers, red and inflamed eyes, a sore throat, mouth sores, and swollen and painful lymph glands, diarrhea, and/or pneumonia. If the bacteria are inhaled, signs can include abrupt onset of headache, fever, chills, a dry cough, muscle aches, joint pain, and progressive weakness. People with pneumonia may already have difficulty breathing, which may be made worse, and can develop chest pain, bloody sputum, and respiratory failure. Tularemia can be fatal if the person is not treated with appropriate antibiotics.

Tularemia must be differentiated from other septicemic diseases (especially plague) or acute pneumonia.

Streptomycin, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, and tetracyclines are effective at recommended dose levels; however, tetracycline and chloramphenicol have been associated with relapses in people. Early treatment should prevent death. Control is difficult and is limited to reducing tick infestation and to rapid diagnosis and treatment. Prolonged treatment may be necessary because many organisms are intracellular. Use of a vaccine previously available for people at high risk of infection (such as, laboratory personnel) is currently under review. Recovery confers long-lasting immunity.
