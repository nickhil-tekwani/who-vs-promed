The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and manufacturers are "developing a candidate virus that could be used to produce a vaccine if one is needed. This will be done only if there is widespread transmission," CDC Director Tom Frieden, MD, MPH, said. The Chinese government has deposited the full genetic sequence for samples of the H7N9 virus in an open database. Since they don't have an isolate of the virus yet, the CDC and manufacturers are using the genetic data to make a vaccine seed strain through reverse genetics, Frieden said. At the briefing, Michael Shaw, PhD, associate laboratory director in the CDC's Influenza Division, said the agency is making the seed strain with synthetic genes that were created under a contract with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) of the US Department of Health and Human Services. "Many different companies and organizations are working on this, to make a strain that would be shared as widely as possible," he said.

The H7 viruses have been known to infect humans before, typically causing only mild illness, and CDC officials said the agency already has candidate vaccines for several of those. But because this novel H7N9 is very different from those strains, the vaccines are not likely to be protective, Frieden said today [5 Apr 2013]. Shaw told CIDRAP News that the CDC has candidate vaccines for H7N1, H7N2, H7N3, and H7N7 viruses, some of which the agency made and some of which were produced by other labs in the World Health Organization's network. Making flu vaccine seed strains using reverse genetics is nothing new, as 29 approved vaccine candidates have been made in this way, Shaw said. Those include 22 H5 vaccines, 3 H9, and 4 H7. When H7N9 isolates become available, the CDC will also try using them to make a candidate vaccine, Shaw said. "Nothing will be left to chance, so conventional reassortment will be attempted," he commented. He referred to the fact that making a flu vaccine involves combining surface proteins from the target virus with a backbone of internal proteins from another flu virus that is known to grow well in eggs.

In response to questions at the briefing, Frieden said, "There is no population immunity to this strain. And there is no specific way to say exactly what it would take to become better adapted" so that it would spread from person to person. The CDC is not issuing any travel advisories, but Frieden repeated the agency's long-standing advice that tourists should avoid birds in live markets.

In its e-mailed health advisory to clinicians today [5 Apr 2013], the CDC said they should consider the possibility of a novel H7N9 infection in persons with an appropriate travel or exposure history. Although most of the cases have been severe and involved adults, the virus may cause mild illness and can infect children, the agency said [China reported a case in a 4-year-old -- see ProMED post Avian influenza, human (26): China H7N9 case list & map, Archive Number: 20130404.1623110, near the end of the list].

Suspected infections in the USA should be reported to the CDC within 24 hours of 1st detection, and state health departments should notify the CDC promptly of all patients under investigation for possible infection, the advisory said. It also advised that all unsubtypeable influenza A virus specimens should be turned over to the CDC for further testing, since the agency is doing all confirmatory testing at this point.

[2] Neuraminidase sensitivity

A new type of flu drug to treat the deadly H7N9 bird flu virus was approved by the Chinese authorities on Saturday [6 Apr 2013]. According to the China Food and Drug Administration, preliminary tests have proved that injections of peramivir diluted in sodium chloride injection may be effective in treating H7N9 bird flu virus. Peramivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor.

As of Saturday [6 Apr 2013], China has confirmed 18 H7N9 cases -- 8 in Shanghai, 6 in Jiangsu, 3 in Zhejiang, and one in Anhui, in the 1st known human infections of the lesser-known strain. Out of all of these, 4 in Shanghai and 2 in Zhejiang have died.

[Subsequently 2 additional cases of elderly patients have been reported in Shanghai and Anhui, bringing the overall total to 20.

Previously it has been reported that the H7N9 avian influenza virus is likewise sensitive to the other neuraminidase inhibitors zanamivir (Relenza; Glaxo Wellcome) and oseltamivir (Tamiflu; Gilead Sciences and F Hoffmann-La Roche) currently used to treat epidemic influenza in the human population. - Mod.CP]
