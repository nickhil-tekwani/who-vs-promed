4 deaths after drinking fermented milk- Gucha District, Nyanza Province, Kenya
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4 children died and 39 were admitted to hospital in Gucha District in
Nyanza Province in Kenya on Sat 16 Jul 2005. All patients fell sick after
drinking colostrum which was fermented. Traditional culture in the area
dictates that after a cow gives birth, the colostrum is fermented and then
served to friends.
In this case, the colostrum was fermented for over 5 days. People who
consumed the fermented colostrum started developing symptoms of diarrhea
and vomiting within 6 hours. 4 children died within 6-10 hours of
consumption of the fermented colostrum. Others were admitted to the
district hospital. Most of the others are in a stable condition. A sample
of the milk has been sent to Nairobi and Kisumu since there are no
facilities to culture at the district hospital.

Children die at Kenyan milk party
---------------------------------
4 children from a Kenyan family have died after drinking contaminated milk
during a traditional celebration. 39 other relatives went to hospital with
vomiting and diarrhea but are now said to be stable.
When a cow gives birth for the first time, the Abagusii community holds a
special party, Chiribiriria, in which the whole family drinks the cow's
milk. The milk is fermented over a week and it is thought it became
contaminated over this time.
The 8 year old daughter of the cow's owner was one of those who died, along
with 3 of her cousins, aged between 4 and 7. They all came from Bohtibigi
village in the western Gucha district.
Medical Officer of Health James Gisami warned that good hygiene must be
observed when preparing milk. "Milk is very delicate and can be a good
culture media for bacteria. It must be boiled and not warmed," he said.

4 children die after drinking milk at fete
------------------------------------------
4 children aged between 4 and 8 have died, while 39 other family members
are admitted to the Gucha District Hospital after they took contaminated
milk at a traditional ceremony. The incident that has shocked residents of
South Mugirango's Itago division, happened last Fri, 15 Jul 2005.
The 4 died after taking fermented milk at a party to celebrate the calving
of a cow. The owner of the cow lost her oldest daughter. She said she went
to Molo to get school fees from her husband who is a watchman, leaving a
neighbor to milk the ill-fated cow, which had calved a week before. Family
members and other relatives then fermented milk from the cow and took it in
the celebration that turned tragic.
Gucha District Public Health officer James Ombaye said the milk was
prepared by the children, all aged under 10 years, adding something could
have gone wrong in the process.
This is a common ritual among the Abagusii. When a cow calves for the first
time, the owner's relatives, neighbors and friends are invited for a party
to celebrate and share the milk for the owner to get the community's
blessings. The milk is kept in gourds to ferment for a week before the
celebrations.
Gucha District Hospital's medical superintendent, Dr Dickson Onchana, told
The Standard the patients were admitted on Sat, 16 Jul 2005, at 5am with
complaints of abdominal pain, diarrhea, dizziness and severe dehydration
after taking milk at the feast that started at 2 am. They were diagnosed
with food poisoning as a result of contamination of the milk from the
bacterium Clostridium potulinum [botulinum? - Mod. LL].
The patients had to be isolated in their own ward because the illness is
contagious. He said clinical officers had been mobilized from Kisii
District Hospital to help contain the situation.

[ProMED-mail would appreciate more information about this cluster of cases.
The last of the 3 reports implies that the illness in this cluster was
botulism. This, however, is not likely to be the case as the incubation
period of foodborne botulism is usually 12-36 hours, substantially longer
than the 3 hours or less noted in this cluster. Furthermore, the cause of
death in botulism is respiratory failure related to neuromuscular
transmission block. Indeed, botulism, although sometimes beginning with
nausea and diarrhea, is basically a descending paralysis beginning with the
cranial nerves. No neurological symptoms appear to be described. Finally,
the fermenting of milk produces acid and _C. botulinum_ does not grow well
in a highly acid medium. One study, however, reported that milk, inoculated
with _C. botulinum_ spores, was found to contain botulinum toxin after
spoilage at 21 degrees C for 6 days (1). Fermentation of some foods,
however, can be associated with botulism. Examples include a variety of
fermented marine products including beaver tail (2), salmon roe (3), walrus
flipper (4), and fish (5). A concise review of dairy product post-harvest
protection is given by Stabel (6).
It may well be the case that the etiology of the cluster is an exogenous
toxin or poison that contaminated the fermented milk before, during or
after fermentation. The need for isolation for these cases is unclear.
