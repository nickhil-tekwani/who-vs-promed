Letter to Rio NY Times Tests Negative for Anthrax
-------------------------------------------------
A Brazilian laboratory said on Saturday that material contained in a letter
sent to the Rio de Janeiro bureau of The New York Times had tested negative
for anthrax. The Times had said on Friday that the suspect letter, handed
over unopened to Brazilian authorities last week, had tested positive for
"bacteria or spores consistent with anthrax."
"The culture carried out on the material that arrived at the New York Times
office tested negative for the anthrax germ," said Paulo Buss, president of
Rio's laboratory Fiocruz, responsible for testing the substance.

Argentina Tests Confirm Letter Laced with Anthrax
-------------------------------------------------
Argentine health authorities confirmed on Friday that a letter sent from
Miami to a woman in Buenos Aires was laced with anthrax spores but they
believed she was not at risk of becoming infected. After initial tests on
Thursday showed it was "highly probable" there were anthrax spores in the
envelope, further DNA tests conducted on
Friday confirmed earlier suspicions. "We are announcing that the test
results were positive," Health Minister Hector Lombardo told a news
conference, adding that a special fund was created on Friday to help pay
for laboratory tests of suspicious letters.
Argentine authorities said they were studying tighter screening measures for
incoming mail. "We are working with the post office to create a
sterilization process
with ozone for all letters that arrive."
Andres Ruiz, head of the state-run Malbran Institute, said that of more than
580 suspicious letters tested to date, only one had tested positive.
