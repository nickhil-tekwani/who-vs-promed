Officials at the New York Racing Association, Inc. (NYRA) and New York State Gaming Commission (NYSGC) have placed Barn 37 at Belmont Park under a precautionary quarantine after a suspected case of Equine Herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) developed in the barn.

Freudnme, a 4-year-old colt trained by Chris Englehart, exhibited fever and neurological signs on Saturday [27 Jun 2020] morning and has started treatment under the care of a private veterinarian.

Freudnme last raced at Finger Lakes Racetrack in the Ontario County Stakes on 24 Jun 2019, where he finished 2nd.

Overseen by Dr. Anthony Verderosa, Director of NYRA's Veterinary Department, and in consultation with the NYSGC, the quarantine of Barn 37 is effective immediately with standard precautions and biosecurity measures now implemented throughout the barn. The length of the quarantine will be determined following the return of test results.

All 37 horses stabled in Barn 37 will be monitored daily for fever and other signs of illness. During the initial quarantine period, these horses will not be permitted to enter races or train among the general horse population.

Afebrile/asymptomatic horses stabled in Barn 37 will have isolated training hours following the closure of the training track.

At this time, no other horses in the quarantined barn have developed fever or exhibited signs.

NYRA will provide additional updates as necessary.

[Certainly, the track is on a high biosecurity alert. It may be that racetracks and commercial barns have their own biosecurity manager. If not, perhaps they should consider it. The previous ProMED-mail posting on equine herpesvirus (20200528.7391992) is a story of very strict biosecurity, and they still suffered outbreaks.

Hopefully, this horse is isolated. Individuals checking on this horse or any horse suspected of EHV should do a complete change of clothes, boots, etc. before moving to another barn or even off the track facilities. You do not want to track this disease back to your own stable. Wash buckets and brushes used on this horse, and do not use them on other horses. Wash your hands and arms and boots, especially. If you have the ability to shower before coming in contact with other animals or people, this would be best. This ugly disease tends to spread easily.

This is an historic year with the Belmont Stakes -- typically the 3rd leg of the Thoroughbred Triple Crown of horse racing -- the 1st race this year [2020]. As officials are hoping to hold the other 2 races, the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness, everyone should be on extra high alert for biosecurity. It is not a time for daydreaming or distractions when dealing with this disease.

We wish all horses and owners the best. - Mod.TG
