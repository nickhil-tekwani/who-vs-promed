[byline: Lisa Schnirring]

A 4th patient has been sickened in cluster of Ebola cases in South Kivu province in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) outbreak, as overall activity in the affected area remained high owing to movements in and out of hot spot areas, the World Health Organization (WHO) said today [22 Aug 2019]. Meanwhile, health officials reported 7 new cases, raising the overall outbreak total to 2934.

In its latest weekly snapshot of the outbreak today [22 Aug 2019], WHO said the 4th South Kivu case involves the father of a child who was one of the first 2 cases identified recently in South Kivu province's Mwenga health zone. The first 2 patients were the child and mother who were exposed to the virus in Beni before they traveled about 435 miles south the South Kivu province. The 3rd was a patient in a health facility where the 1st patient had initially sought care.

In Pinga, a remote area where Ebola was recently detected, officials so far haven't found any epidemiologic links to other cases or recent travel or visitors from other affected areas of the DRC. WHO said the illness there poses a challenge not only because of its remoteness but also because of security and resistance among the patient's family.

WHO said that, over the past week, the intensity of transmission hadn't changed much, but it continues to see high numbers, sustained local activity, and movement of infected people in and out of 3 hot spots: Beni, Mandima, and Butembo. It also added that an emerging cluster in Mambasa, which has piled up 14 cases in the past 21 days, poses a high risk of transmission.

Eleven probable cases have been added, raising that number to 105, WHO said. The illnesses involve people who died in the community in 4 different health zones from March through June [2019] and who couldn't be sampled for lab testing.

WHO said it is bracing for more cases and spread to new areas, based on another temporary suspension of Ebola activities on 19 Aug 2019 over a community protest in Beni, Butembo, and Oicha in response to the latest round of attacks on civilians by armed groups. Response operations resumed the next day [20 Aug 2019], but WHO said it anticipated more demonstrations and added that past interruptions have been followed by increases in cases and spread of the disease to new areas.

According to WHO's online Ebola dashboard today [22 Aug 2019], the DRC reported 7 new cases, based on numbers through yesterday [21 Aug 2019], raising the overall total to 2934 cases. Health officials are still investigating 382 suspected infections. A total of 8 more people died from their infections, pushing the outbreak's fatality count to 1961.

In outbreak response developments, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced yesterday [21 Aug 2019] that its Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) will provide USD 23 million to Merck to produce the VSV-EBOV vaccine over the next year. Rick Bright, BARDA director, said in an HHS press release that the best way to protect people at home from Ebola is to stop the virus from spreading abroad, and that an effective vaccine is an essential tool for that. "By ensuring that investigational vaccines continue to be available, we aid the global response and, simultaneously, help improve domestic preparedness," he said.

HHS said BARDA will also continue to work with Merck on obtaining Food and Drug Administration approval for VSV-EBOV. Also, under an interagency agreement between BARDA and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, BARDA has provided funding for the Department of Defense to transport bulk vaccine materials from Merck's Germany facility to its plant in Pennsylvania that will make the additional vaccine doses.

The new BARDA funding brings its support for VSV-EBOB to about USD 176 million. As of 16 Aug 2019, more than 192 000 people in the outbreak area have been vaccinated based on a compassionate use protocol.

Meanwhile, Japan today [22 Aug 2019] announced USD 5 million in support to assist the DRC with its Ebola response, according to a statement from the country's foreign affairs ministry. In response to the DRC's request, Japan in July [2019] provided emergency relief goods and said it will dispatch an infectious disease response team to help strengthen quarantine and other activities.

[WHO: Disease Outbreak News, abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/csr/don/22-august-2019-ebola-drc/en/

The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo continued this week with similar transmission intensity [see Figure 1 at the source URL]. While the past few weeks of the outbreak have been characterized by the geographic expansion of cases to new health zones, we continue to see high case numbers, sustained local transmission, and inter-health zone movement of cases both into and out of the hotspot areas of Beni, Mandima, and Butembo. In the past 21 days from 31 Jul through 20 Aug 2019, 69 health areas within 19 health zones reported new cases [see Table 1 and Figure 2 at the source URL]. During this period, a total of 216 confirmed cases were reported, with the majority coming from the health zones of Beni (31%, n = 66), Mandima (18%, n = 38), and Butembo (8%, n = 18). High risks of transmission are also associated with an emerging cluster in the city of Mambasa, which has reported 14 cases in the past 21 days. The response continues to address these hotspots through early case detection and thorough investigation, strong contact identification and follow up, and engagement with the local communities.

Two new health zones reported cases in the past week: Mwenga Health Zone in South Kivu and Pinga Health Zone in North Kivu. In Mwenga, 4 confirmed cases were reported after 2 individuals (mother and child) had contact with a confirmed case in Beni before travelling south. The father of the child was subsequently confirmed positive, as was a co-patient in a community health facility where the 1st case initially sought care.

In Pinga, one confirmed case has been reported with no apparent epidemiological links to other cases and no recent travel or visitors from outbreak-affected areas. Pinga presents an added challenge to response teams in terms of remoteness, limited telecommunications, security risks, and resistance within the affected family and community.

As of 20 Aug 2019, a total of 2927 EVD cases were reported, including 2822 confirmed and 105 probable cases, of which 1961 cases died (overall case fatality ratio, 67%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 58% (1697) were female, and 28% (830) were children aged less than 18 years. To date, 154 health workers have been infected.

An additional 11 probable cases were validated last week; among these were cases who died in the community in Katwa, Kyondo, Vuhovi, and Mabalako health zones during March through June 2019 with epidemiological links to the outbreak; these cases could not be sampled for laboratory testing to confirm/exclude EVD.

On 19 Aug 2019, a "ville morte" protest took place in Beni, Butembo, and Oicha in response to recent attacks by armed groups on civilians. This resulted in a temporary suspension of Ebola response activities. Operations resumed on 20 Aug 2019 with increased caution, and further demonstrations are anticipated. The suspension of Ebola response activities often results in an increase of case numbers and spread of cases to new areas in the subsequent weeks.

[byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

WHO said today [21 Aug 2019] the 3rd case of Ebola identified in South Kivu province was in a patient who contracted the virus at a health center where other Ebola patients had been treated. Details of the nosocomial transmission emerged in WHO's latest situation report on the ongoing Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). In the past week, 2 more DRC regions far from outbreak hot spots have reported cases: South Kivu province and Pinga health zone, which is in North Kivu province.

WHO is still investigating how the case-patient in Pinga contracted the virus, but investigations have shown a mother and child in Mwenga, South Kivu, became infected after contact with a patient from Beni, the city most hard hit by the outbreak this summer. The 2 towns are about 473 miles apart, and South Kivu province shares a border with Rwanda and Burundi.

"The 3rd confirmed case was a co-patient in a community health facility where the 1st cases initially sought care," WHO said. WHO said 11% of all cases in this outbreak have come from nosocomial transmission, and 5% have involved healthcare workers.

In the past 3 weeks, officials confirmed 215 cases in North Kivu, Ituri, and South Kivu provinces, with most coming from Beni (33%) and Mandima (20%). A total of 57 Ebola cases were confirmed in the past week, down slightly from the summer's average of around 80 cases per week.

Today [21 Aug 2019], however, WHO's Ebola dashboard shows 18 newly confirmed cases, which raises the outbreak total to 2927, including 1953 deaths. Officials are still investigating 347 suspected cases. Women represent 58% of the cases, the WHO said, with children representing 28%.

The Rwandan newspaper The New Times reported that the country is in talks to acquire 100 000 doses of Merck's rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine in an effort to vaccinate traders who work along the Rwandan-DRC border as a preventive step. The health ministry offered no further details on when authorities would start the vaccination campaign, but officials did tell the BBC that they would first focus on the 60 000 traders who cross in and out of the DRC most frequently, the story said.

In other news, the European Union (EU) announced it would help Burundi secure funding for [Ebola] preparedness measures, including surveillance efforts. The EU will give the country EUR 465 000 (USD 515 430), allocated through WHO. Finally, the Norwegian Refugee Council yesterday [20 Aug 2019] published a new report on the outbreak, and it said convincing local communities within the DRC of the severity of the outbreak is the most important step needed to end the crisis. "There is resistance from the communities to work with the Ebola response teams," said Nema Dounamou, WHO team leader in Beni. "The more time that passes, the more used to the threat people become. We are already struggling with people not realising the severity of the epidemic."

Ebola Virus disease Democratic Republic of Congo: external situation report 55 / 2019
Data as reported by 18 Aug 2019
-------------------------------

In the past week, 57 new confirmed Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases with an additional 46 deaths have been reported from 18 health zones in 3 affected provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). In the 21 days from 29 Jul through 18 Aug 2019, 65 health areas in 18 health zones reported new cases, representing 10% of the 665 health areas in North Kivu, South Kivu and Ituri provinces [see Table 1 and Figure 2 at the source URL]. During this period, a total of 215 confirmed cases were reported, with the majority coming from the health zones of Beni (33%, n = 70) and Mandima (20%, n = 44).

Cases were detected in 2 new health zones this past week: Mwenga Health Zone in South Kivu and Pinga Health Zone in North Kivu. In Mwenga, 3 confirmed cases have been reported thus far after 2 individuals (mother and child) had contact with a confirmed case in Beni before travelling south. The 3rd confirmed case was a co-patient in a community health facility where the 1st cases initially sought care. In Pinga, one confirmed case has been reported, and investigations are ongoing to identify epidemiological links between this individual and outbreak-affected areas. Rapid response teams were quickly deployed to scale up surveillance and response operations in both areas.

As of 18 Aug 2019, a total of 2888 EVD cases were reported, including 2794 confirmed and 94 probable cases, of which 1938 cases died (overall case fatality ratio, 67%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases with reported sex and age, 58% (1672) were female and 28% (810) were children aged less than 18 years. Cases continue to be reported among health workers, with the cumulative number infected rising to 153 (5% of all confirmed and probable cases).

- Tue 20 Aug 2019. Rwanda: vaccine purchase
[The New Times, abridged, edited]
https://www.newtimes.co.rw/news/rwanda-fast-tracking-purchase-ebola-vaccine
[Byline: James Karuhanga]

Rwanda is in talks to acquire at least 100 000 doses of an Ebola vaccine for a mass vaccination campaign that targets traders around the country's border with DR Congo, according to reports. The Ministry of Health confirmed to The New Times that the government is currently fast tracking negotiations to buy doses of an Ebola vaccine.

Without divulging details, Malick Kayumba, spokesperson of the Ministry of Health, said Tuesday [20 Aug 2019] that negotiations are still ongoing. "This is still under negotiations but Rwanda is doing everything possible so that the process moves fast because this is one way of preventing Ebola," he said. "And Rwanda is ready to do whatever is possible to protect its citizens. We will give more information soon," he said when pressed for further comments.

The BBC reported on Tuesday [20 Aug 2019] that more than 60 000 traders in eastern DR Congo who cross the border regularly into Rwanda and Uganda are to be vaccinated. It is not clear when the mass vaccination campaign will start and the cost associated, as well as the type of vaccine to be used.

However, media reports suggest that the experimental vaccine to be used is backed by international health experts, including WHO. The vaccine in question, the BBC reported, is produced by Johnson & Johnson, an American multinational [medical devices and pharmaceutical company] and is different from the single-dose Merck vaccine that has been used over the past year in DR Congo.

WHO's director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Monday [19 Aug 2019] announced that they now have an Ebola vaccine that is more than 97% effective, and treatments that are more than 90% effective if used early enough. Dr Tedros said in tweet that "Ebola is preventable and treatable. We need to make sure everyone in the affected area knows that." The latest development comes after the UN health agency last week announced that the co-sponsors of the Ebola therapeutics trial in the DR Congo had announced advances that will bring patients a better chance of survival. Two of the 4 drugs being tested were found to be effective in treating Ebola.

No case of Ebola has been reported in Rwanda where the government has intensified preventive measures.

Armed men, Mai-Mai militants, this Tuesday [20 Aug 2019] attacked the Kambuli Health Center, a health facility located in the Ngingi District, in Mususa commune in the town of Butembo (North Kivu). The information delivered to 7SUR7.CD by Mbaytoya Bovick, bourgmestre [mayor] of the said commune, indicates that the enemy, during his visit, vandalized all material goods of the Kambuli Health Center. "Several material assets have been vandalized, including the malicious destruction of the Ebola Prevention Kits," he said.

The municipal authority of Mususa calls, moreover, the inhabitants of Ngingi for calm while reassuring them of importance of the security forces and defense deployed in the region.

https://www.radiookapi.net/2019/08/21/actualite/sante/sud-kivu-les-mesures-de-lutte-contre-ebola-renforcees-la-frontiere-de

The number of people leaving the DRC to Burundi by the Kavimvira post has increased from 800 to 1300 per day since last weekend, said the head of the Directorate General of Migration (DGM) in Kavimvira on Tuesday [20 Aug 2019]. Ebola virus disease control systems have been strengthened in this role.

Travelers from the Congolese territory of Mwenga, who had recently encountered difficulties on their way to Rwandan territory, headed for the Congolese-Burundian border from Kavimvira to Gatumba. The migratory flow has increased, confirms the head of the DGM in Kavimvira, evoking long queues observed these days at the exit counters in the morning.

To prevent the occurrence of Ebola, a new handwashing device was installed for vehicle drivers, in addition to the old one that was made available to passengers and other travelers. However, the border health postmaster, Jonas Mafresi Mwanawabene, says control is fraught with difficulties. "We need a thermal camera, devices that are well suited. We have a hand washing water problem from REGIDESO to be able to conduct this activity well. And the vaccine is not yet available in Kavimvira for the personnel of the border health post, the DGM, the police and the army."

[European Commission press release, edited]
https://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-19-5390_en.htm

The Ebola virus disease outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo continues to spread in the east of the country with a high risk of a spill-over into the neighbouring countries. The European Union (EU) is stepping up its assistance to Burundi with EUR 465 000 [USD 515 550] to further strengthen Ebola preparedness measures by authorities and aid organisations in the country.

Christos Stylianides, commissioner for humanitarian aid and crisis management, who is also the EU's Ebola coordinator, said: "To effectively fight the Ebola virus we do not only have to address the affected cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo but also increase our efforts to prevent the disease from spreading to neighbouring countries like Burundi. The European Union is therefore supporting ongoing Ebola preparedness measures in the country, including infection prevention and control. Everything possible must be done to avoid a further spread of the deadly virus."

The new EU funding will be allocated through WHO. It will strengthen the coordination, surveillance and response capacities to Ebola in high-risk districts in Burundi, close to the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo. This new funding complements the existing financial support to the ongoing EU efforts in Ebola surveillance and awareness-raising via NGOs and UN.

Background
----------
Since 2018, the EU has provided EUR 47 million [USD 52.1 million] to humanitarian partners in the Democratic Republic of Congo involved in the Ebola response in the affected areas as well as in high-risk areas. In parallel, the EU has also been supporting Ebola prevention and preparedness measures in the neighbouring countries most at risk -- Uganda, South Sudan, Rwanda and Burundi -- with over EUR 4 million [USD 4.43 million] in humanitarian aid to ensure rapid detection and treatment in case of spill-over.

- Tue 20 Aug 2019. Data collection gaps are damning the Ebola outbreak
[Contagionlive, abridged, edited]
https://www.contagionlive.com/contributor/saskia-v-popescu/2019/08/data-collection-gaps-are-damning-the-ebola-outbreak
[byline: Saskia V Popescu]

In the face of this expanding outbreak that has surpassed 2700 confirmed cases, there has been much attention on the drug and vaccine trials that are ongoing. Unfortunately, in the fervor of excitement surrounding the promise of treatment, few have paid attention to the quality of data that [are] made available. Pierre Rollin, MD, a veteran Ebola fighter, recently drew attention to some deeply concerning issues in the outbreak response in an article in The Lancet Infectious Diseases.

Rollin underscored that although there was initial confidence in the response to the outbreak, mostly due to therapeutics and experienced personnel, leadership and coordination failures amid a conflict zone and community mistrust all helped the outbreak spiral. One component of Rollin's review is deeply concerning -- the "ineffectiveness of the collection, analysis, and diffusion of epidemiological data, the centerpiece of any response, is predictive of the situation worsening." Similar to what was felt by many on the ground during the 2014-2016 West African Ebola outbreak, the various databases between agencies, groups, etc., all made situational awareness and response that much more challenging.

What is so worrisome about these database variances and gaps is that case counts are off and, therefore, monitoring is impacted. Perhaps one of the most startling findings was that most of the probable cases are not being recorded. A lack of data on probable cases means that not only do we not have an accurate understanding of the outbreak, but that intervention for those cases is likely not happening. Moreover, Rollin notes that the research efforts (vaccine, treatment, etc.) have their own data collection practices that are focused on the scientific outcome and research publications agenda, rather than public health. In addition to these critical data variances, "Laboratory diagnosis is done at multiple sites by the Institut National de Recherches Biologiques [National Institute of Biological Research]. This achievement is tempered by overconfidence in the capabilities of the laboratories, incomplete sharing of results with patient providers, low quality-control procedures, and unjustified fear of losing control."

Now, consider that the data collected and generated by the vaccination and contact tracing teams isn't being shared. The findings within Rollin's research are still deeply worrisome and shed light on the broken response efforts that are only fueling the outbreak. How can we effectively perform contact tracing without the relevant vaccination data? Or vice versa? How can we possibly understand the magnitude of the cases if most of the probable cases aren't being reported? Although this problem isn't entirely novel in outbreaks involving multiple agencies, organizations, and even companies, Rollin's point should not be ignored in the face of perceived therapeutic breakthroughs. Response efforts must include not only resolving these data and collection issues, but also working with local providers to ensure community trust is re-established, reducing healthcare worker transmission, and ensuring efforts are cohesive and collaborative.

- Wed 21 Aug 2019. Regional Strategy for Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response 2020-2030
[World Health Organization Regional Office for Africa, abridged, edited]
https://www.afro.who.int/news/risks-outbreaks-grow-african-health-ministers-agree-new-response-strategy

With an acute public health event reported every 4 days on the continent, it is more important than ever before for African countries to be able to respond to health emergencies. African health ministers today [21 Aug 2019] adopted a 10-year regional strategy that aims to strengthen integrated disease surveillance and response and mitigate the devastating impact of outbreaks, such as Ebola.

Africa has more outbreaks and other health emergencies than any other region of the world, and many of them could be prevented or controlled through proven public health interventions.

Worryingly, recent analysis by WHO indicates that emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases and other public health emergencies are on the rise, predictably in certain areas and unpredictably in other places. This increase is largely attributed to the growth of cross-border movements and international travel, increasing human population density and informal settlements, along with climate change impacts and changes in the way humans and wild animals interact. More than 80% of the public health emergencies in the WHO African Region between 2016 and 2018 were due to infectious diseases.

The new strategy aims to ensure that countries can cope with major outbreaks and other health emergencies. It is crucial for all countries to have an effective surveillance system, which can track common diseases and set off alarms for the timely containment of disease epidemics or for early detection and investigation of any abnormal clustering of cases or deaths of a new event.

The Regional Strategy for Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response 2020-2030 was adopted by health ministers during the 69th session of the WHO Regional Committee for Africa, which is taking place in Brazzaville, the Republic of Congo. The Regional Committee is the governing mechanism involving health ministers from all 47 member states of the WHO African Region. The new strategy builds on more than 20 years of working with a comprehensive, evidence-based integrated surveillance system that ensures countries stay a step ahead of many dangerous pathogens.

"The current Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is a poignant reminder of the importance of a strong surveillance system," said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa. "Only when every case is promptly detected, quickly hospitalized and offered timely medical care -- and all close contacts vaccinated and properly monitored -- will the Ebola outbreak end. Equally important, devastating outbreaks can be 'nipped in the bud' if cases are quickly detected before they widely spread in communities."

The regional strategy urges the 47 WHO member states to establish and sustain robust public health surveillance and resilient health systems and to commit the necessary financial resources (domestic and external) for priority interventions, including ensuring good leadership and vigorous accountability frameworks, promoting the availability of skilled health workers at all levels, providing feedback to communities and sharing information among member states, strengthening high-quality community-based surveillance for the early detection and reporting of priority diseases and improving national laboratory systems.
