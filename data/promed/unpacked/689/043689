[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 230 555 cases, including 32 955 deaths, up by 397 cases and 79 deaths in the past 24 hours. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are also in decline.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in the northern part of the country, in Lombardy, the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Piedmont. These 4 provinces combined account for 69.8% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Lombardy is the only province reporting more than 100 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. 13 provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (4 provinces reported no new cases), another 5 provinces reported fewer than 50 newly confirmed cases, and 2 provinces reported more than 50 but less than 100 cases, all signs of decreasing local transmission. Increases in cases may reflect the post weekend catchup in reporting.

Italy is now 23 days post phase 2 initial opening up, and 7 days post 2nd stage of phase 2 opening up. All eyes are now on Italy as lockdown restrictions are phased out.

[Given the recent changes in disease reporting by Spain, it is difficult to draw trend comparisons at this time. Only to rehash, according to today's (26 May 2020) report, there were 859 newly confirmed cases (presumably by PCR) in the past 24 hours, bringing the confirmed cumulative total to 236 259, a 24-hour increase greater than the 194 reported in the table above due to changes in reporting criteria. A total of 27 117 deaths are reported as of today (25 May 2020).

The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population is now 14.86 (a slight increase from 25 May 2020 when it was 14.56), a continual slow decrease over the past 28 days.

Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease, and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times. According to Table 2, of the 236 259 cases, an additional 256 cases have been hospitalized, and an additional 12 cases were admitted to ICU. Overall, 9.3% of hospitalized patients have been admitted to ICU.
