Brussels [meaning the European Commission - Mod.JW
may block vital safeguards against rabies contained in Britain's
"passports for pets" proposals to replace quarantine. Compulsory blood tests
on animals at British ports [to check vaccinal status and mandatory
treatments to kill any dangerous parasites unknown in the UK clash with the
European Commission's vision of open-frontier travel and trade.
Instead the Commission has drawn up its own plans for pets travelling
between Britain and the rest of the EU, it emerged at the British Veterinary
Association Congress in Nottingham yesterday. And they contain none of the
planned safeguards. In addition, senior EU officials have told the
Government that elaborate frontier checks between member states were
unacceptable.
The EU wants immediate access to the UK for dogs and cats provided they have
been vaccinated against rabies. Under the British plans - endorsed by the
Government, vets, animal welfare organisations and pet pressure groups - it
could be four years before the law allows people to take their pets to and
from EU and other selected countries without having to subject them to six
months in quarantine.
Leading vets warned yesterday that the EU Commission might seize the
initiative from the Government and press ahead with its looser scheme before
British measures were ready. One said: "The danger is that the Commission
will step in and hijack this issue and press for a simpler scheme more
acceptable to other member states. We must resist this at all costs."
Nick Brown, the Minister of Agriculture, and the advisory committee argue
that a period of up to three years to introduce the passport scheme is
essential to allow Britain to implement effective controls. They want to
avoid teething troubles which afflicted Sweden when it abandoned quarantine
in 1994. While the Government was hoping the scheme might become a blueprint
for the rest of the EU, the plans now threaten to provoke a new row over
sovereignty and interference from Brussels
Vets did admit at the conference that the Government would be unlikely to
win any legal challenge against Brussels on the grounds of protecting human
health. Vaccination against rabies is widely accepted in Europe as
protection enough. But they warned that they would resist any EU moves to
weaken the safeguards set out in the Kennedy report.
Ted Chandler, the president of the British Veterinary Association, said: "We
must not have pets entering the country simply on the basis that they have
been vaccinated. The fact is the easier you make it the quicker you would
have rabies in this country."
[When I was in the UK last week a classmate in clinical practice indicated
to me that there was a serious concern about the animal health porosity
along the eastern border of the EU, quite apart from the common experience
that valid veterinary documents issued in various European countries
sometimes lacked veracity. mod MHJ
