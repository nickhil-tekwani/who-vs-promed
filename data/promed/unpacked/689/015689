Heavy rains triggered the development of "white spot" disease in
onion, according to the National Forest, Agriculture and Livestock
Research Institute, INIFAP.

Researchers projected a fall in agricultural production of 50
percent. They toured the growing areas to quantify the damage and
devise a support strategy for affected farmers. The south and east of
the state reported the most damage.

Some fruit trees were damaged by the rainfall, but the most serious
casualties were the onion crops affected by "white spot" disease.

[A number of pathogens can cause lesions or mottling on onion leaves
leading to an appearance of affected plants which may be described as
'white spot disease.' We would be grateful for further information.
