In 2018, as of 30 Aug 2018, 975 confirmed and probable autochthonous human West Nile virus [WNV] infections were reported by European countries: 710 in EU/EEA Member States and 265 in EU neighbouring countries. Italy reported 327 cases, Serbia 213, Greece 147, Romania 117, Hungary 96, Israel 49, France 11, Austria 8, Croatia 3, Kosovo 3 and Slovenia 1.

So far, this year [2018], we observed a 3.4-fold increase in the number of WNV infections in humans compared to the entire season last year [2017]. In comparison, the last major WNV season was in 2010, which resulted in 393 human WNV infections in the EU/EEA and EU neighbouring countries.

To date, a total of 64 deaths due to West Nile virus infection have been reported by Serbia (21), Greece (16), Italy (13), Romania (12), France (1) and Kosovo* (1). In comparison to the previous 6 years, the proportion of fatal cases has not increased.

The high number of cases observed this year [2018] compared with previous years suggests a high level of virus circulation in affected countries, which could potentially result in an even higher number of cases during the coming months.

The assessment of the transmission risk in the EU/EEA, as stated in ECDC's Rapid Risk Assessment published on 13 Aug 2018, remains valid. Personal protection from mosquito bites is advisable for any person residing in or visiting affected areas, especially the elderly and immunocompromised who are at higher risk of developing severe symptoms.

Health officials in Serbia have reported new deaths from West Nile virus, where over 200 people are confirmed to be infected. The disease has also claimed lives in several EU countries.

Serbian authorities announced on Wednesday [29 Aug 2018] that 6 people have died after being infected by the West Nile virus last week, bringing the current death toll to 21. Serbia, with 213 infected cases, is the European country worst-hit by the disease.

At the same time, Greece reported 5 deaths due to the West Nile virus during the past week. The overall toll now stands at 16, with 130 registered cases of infection.

At least 9 people have died from the disease in Italy and another 6 people in Romania. Two fatalities have also been reported in Kosovo.

The exact number of cases is likely much larger, as humans infected with the mosquito-borne virus typically show no signs of disease and require no treatment. Only about 20 percent of those infected exhibit symptoms similar to influenza, such as fever, headaches, fatigue and swelling of the lymph nodes. Less than one percent of patients develop encephalitis or meningitis, which could potentially lead to death.

The virus has been present in Serbia since 2012, according to infectious disease specialist Dragan Delic, as cited by the Serbian daily Blic. He warned that global warming is likely to boost the spread of other tropical diseases into new areas, including "malaria and dengue fever."

Health experts believe the West Nile virus expanded its foothold in Europe through migratory birds. While there is no vaccine for it, doctors say the risk of infection can be managed by using protection from mosquito bites.

[WNV activity has been higher than in previous years, with cases reported from many countries, and Serbia has reported 213 cases to date according to the ECDC update in section [1] above.

Vector control and community mobilization, awareness, and support are the key steps to controlling disease transmission for WNV, as with other vector borne diseases such as dengue and chikungunya - Mod.UBA
