Vet claims goat was a health risk at Fair
-----------------------------------------
The Tehama District Fair Board heard 20 Oct 2009 from Sandy Flournoy,
a veterinarian at Antelope Veterinary Hospital, about an issue
regarding a possible exposure at the fair to an animal with caseous
lymphadenitis (CL).

"If an animal has scars and is a carrier it is a risk," Flournoy
said. "If the abscess broke and drained the animal should have been
excused. It is a human pathogen and is transmittable to all species."

Although Flournoy did not see the animal herself, she said the
disease is contagious enough that even the slight chance of it being
present should be dealt with seriously.

The animal in question was a market goat, which several parents,
including one 4-H mother present Tuesday [20 Oct 2009], said they saw
had an abscess that had broken and drained.

Flournoy said regardless of whether or not it was CL, the animal
should have been excused.

"All the animals were looked at by a licensed practicing veterinarian
and he made a judgment call," said Fair CEO Mark Eidman. "I have to
back his decision. He inspected the animal prior to the fair opening
[24 Sep 2009] and he did not note any health risk to the animal or
the public."

Fair Livestock manager Nancy May told the board in a letter that all
animals were checked by a licensed veterinarian on Wednesday [23 Sep
2009] before the fair and again before the animals went on the scales.

After being approached by parents of exhibitors regarding an animal
with an oozing abscess, May said she looked at the animal and did not
see anything, but also asked a licensed veterinarian to inspect.

"I felt at no time that I dropped the ball putting any livestock,
exhibitor or fairgoer at risk," May said. "I do not feel that the
Tehama District Fairground is unsafe for livestock or that any person
connected with the fair is uncaring of the welfare of its livestock
patrons. How much further do you go past a licensed veterinarian?"

A few members of the Manton 4-H came to the meeting including one
girl who addressed the board. The girl said she could not believe
more of an effort wasn't taken to protect the animals, public, and
especially the children who were exposed to the goat.

Fair Board director Farrell Shatswell assured the audience that the
fair board would do all that it could to keep the fair safe. "I
personally Cloroxed [cleaned with bleach] the metal pens and
everywhere the alleged animal was," Eidman said.

The fair board meets at 1 p.m. on the 3rd Tuesday of the month at the
fairground.

[Caseous abscessation of lymph nodes and internal organs caused by
_Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis_ occurs worldwide and is widely
distributed throughout North America. While this disease carries a
name similar to tuberculosis, it is not tuberculosis. It is an
important endemic infection in regions with large sheep and goat
populations, especially market or meat goats. Economic losses result
mostly from condemnation and trim of infected carcasses and
devaluation of hides. Caseous lymphadenitis is also a cause of
ill-thrift and sudden death in animals with internal abscesses.
Although principally an infection of sheep and goats, sporadic
disease also occurs in horses and cattle, camelids, water buffalo,
wild ruminants, primates, pigs, and fowl. It rarely causes regional
lymphadenitis in humans.

Caseous lymphadenitis is a chronic, recurring disease. A slowly
enlarging, localized, and non painful abscess may develop either at
the point of entry into the skin or in the regional lymph node
(superficial or external form), from which it may spread via the
blood or lymphatic system and cause abscessation of internal lymph
nodes or organs (visceral or internal form). Initial infection may
cause no clinical signs or may be accompanied by high fever,
anorexia, anemia, and cellulitis at the infection site. Superficial
abscesses enlarge and may rupture and discharge infectious pus.

Other less common manifestations include caseous bronchopneumonia,
arthritis, abortion, CNS abscessation often occurring in the
pituitary gland, abscessation of a vertebral body causing paresis or
paralysis, scrotal abscessation, and rarely, mastitis. Scrotal
(inguinal) abscesses can cause temporary infertility in rams. The
incidence of abscesses steadily increases with age; clinical disease
is more prevalent in adults, and up to 40 percent of animals in a
flock can have superficial abscesses.

The diagnosis can usually be based on clinical signs and flock
history. For definitive diagnosis, an aspirate of an intact abscess
should be submitted for bacteriologic examination; _C
pseudotuberculosis_ can easily be isolated, although it may be
recovered in mixed culture with other pyogenic organisms. Suppurative
lymphadenitis and abscesses can also be caused by various other
pyogenic organisms, such as _Arcanobacterium (Actinomyces) pyogenes_,
_Staphylococcus aureus_, _Pasteurella multocida_, and occasionally
anaerobes such as _Fusobacterium necrophorum_.

Although the organism is susceptible to penicillin, treatment with
antibiotics is usually not attempted because the formation of
abscesses limits their penetration and effectiveness.

Commercial vaccines, currently only licensed for use in sheep, reduce
the incidence and prevalence of caseous lymphadenitis within a flock,
but they neither prevent all new infections nor cure animals already
infected. Currently, all contain phospholipase D toxoid, and some
also contain killed whole bacterial cells. Usually, _Clostridium
tetani_ and _C. perfringens_ type D, along with other clostridial
antigens, are included in the vaccine.

Although rare, caseous lymphadenitis in man can be a serious disease
requiring hospitalization, prolonged antibiotic therapy, and even
surgery. Clients should be made aware of this and advised to take
appropriate precautions when handling infected sheep. The organism
generally enters the body through a scrape or a cut.

While the disease in man is rare, it can occur. The risk to most
humans at the fair is likely low. The attending veterinarian may not
have noticed the abscess if it was small when the animal arrived at
the facilities. Nevertheless a ruptured abscess can put other animals
at risk of the disease.

Many fairs give the appearance of checking the animals for disease
and zoonotics, but sometimes the veterinarians working the fairs are
under strict orders to keep the most participants and overlook
anything except the most serious of diseases.

The fairs should showcase the best of the best, not the best that
have learned to get around the rules. Often time ringworm and warts
are covered over with iodine and shoe polish to get past the cursory
veterinary inspection and be accepted into the show.

The question should be asked, why not teach the participants,
regardless of age, to be upright and truthful and showcase the best
instead of finding ways to get around the rules and cheating to win?
