Unique Parasite Strain Causes Atypical Leishmaniasis Cases in Brazil
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Background
Atypical cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) has become progressively more frequent in Corte de Pedra, Northeast Brazil. Herein we characterize clinical presentation, antimony response, cytokine production and parasite strains prevailing in ACL.

Methodology/Principal Findings
Between 2005 and 2012, 51 ACL (cases) and 51 temporally matched cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) subjects (controls) were enrolled and followed over time in Corte de Pedra. Clinical and therapeutic data were recorded for all subjects. Cytokine secretion by patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) stimulated with soluble parasite antigen in vitro, and genotypes in a 600 base-pair locus in chromosome 28 (CHR28/425451) of the infecting _L. (V.) braziliensis_ were compared between the 2 groups. ACL presented significantly more lesions in head and neck, and higher rate of antimony failure than CL. Cytosine-Adenine substitutions at CHR28/425451 positions 254 and 321 were highly associated with ACL (p less than 0.0001). In vitro stimulated ACL PBMCs produced lower levels of IFN-gamma (p = 0.0002) and TNF (p less than 0.0001), and higher levels of IL-10 (p = 0.0006) and IL-17 (p = 0.0008) than CL PBMCs.

Conclusions/Significance
ACL found in Northeast Brazil is caused by distinct genotypes of _L. (V.) braziliensis_ and presents a cytokine profile that departs from that in classical CL patients. We think that differences in antigenic contents among parasites may be in part responsible for the variation in cytokine responses and possibly immunopathology between CL and ACL.

[The study published in PLoSNegl Trop Dis (doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0005100) does not claim to have identified a new subspecies of _Leishmania_ parasites. The genetic analysis is quite limited to a few snips on only 2 loci.

A European ESCMID (European Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases) Study Group has just published a multicenter study of methods used to type _Leishmania_ parasites (Eurosurveillance, Volume 21, Issue 49, 8 Dec 2016 http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=22662) setting a reference standard for such work. Thus the _Leishmania_ parasites described by Guimarães et al. should be analyzed further to fully understand whether this is indeed a new _Leishmania_ subspecies or if there are other explanations for the atypical presentations of the infection. - Mod.EP
