New Hepatitis E Cases in Kitgum
-------------------------------
Authorities in Kitgum District, Uganda, have expressed fears that the
fight against the deadly hepatitis E virus is stagnating and the
disease is showing signs of resurgence. Kitgum chairman John Bosco
Ogwok raised the concern on Monday [21 Sep 2009] after reports that 8
new cases had been reported in the district over the weekend.
Speaking to The Daily Monitor, Mr Ogwok said the 8 new cases were
found by Kitgum Town Council on Saturday. He blamed the outbreak on
residents whom he accused of failing to observe proper hygiene.
Hepatitis E spreads though eating food or drinking fluids that are
contaminated with human [and/or animal] waste.

[At the end of May 2009 it was reported that in the previous 2 weeks
hepatitis E virus infection had killed 2 people and left 60 others
infected in the Kitgum District. That brought the total number of
infections in the district to 1010, and the death toll to 160 since
the disease broke out in the previous year [2008]. The above current
report indicates that hepatitis E virus infection is still prevalent
in the District and improvements in sanitation and provision of clean
water still remain a priority in the district.
