When it comes to COVID-19, anyone, even without symptoms, can be a "superspreader" capable of unknowingly infecting a large number of people and causing a community outbreak. That's why it is so important right now to wear masks when out in public and avoid large gatherings, especially those held indoors, where a superspreader can readily infect others with SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19.

Driving home this point is a new NIH-funded study on the effects of just one superspreader event in the Boston area: an international biotech conference held in February [2020], before the public health risks of COVID-19 had been fully realized [see B below]. Almost 100 people were infected. But it didn't end there.

In the study, the researchers sequenced close to 800 viral genomes, including cases from across the 1st wave of the epidemic in the Boston area. Using the fact that the viral genome changes in very subtle ways over time, they found that SARS-CoV-2 was actually introduced independently to the region more than 80 times, primarily from Europe and other parts of the United States. But the data also suggest that a single superspreading event at the biotech conference led to the infection of almost 20 000 people in the area, not to mention additional COVID-19 cases in other states and around the world.

The researchers' team set out to help Boston's public health officials understand just how the epidemic escalated so quickly in the Boston area, and just how much the February conference had contributed to community transmission of the virus. They also investigated other case clusters in the area, including within a skilled nursing facility, homeless shelters, and at Massachusetts General Hospital itself, to understand the spread of COVID-19 in these settings.

Based on contact tracing, officials had already connected approximately 90 cases of COVID-19 to the biotech conference, 28 of which were included in the original 772 viral genomes in this dataset. Based on the distinct genomic fingerprint carried by the 28 genomes, the researchers went on to discover that more than one-third of Boston area cases without any known link to the conference could indeed be traced back to the event.

When the researchers considered this proportion to the number of cases recorded in the region during the study, they extrapolated that the superspreader event led to nearly 20 000 cases in the Boston area. In contrast, the genome data show cases linked to another superspreader event that took place within a skilled nursing facility, while devastating to the residents, had much less of an impact on the surrounding community.

The analysis also uncovered some unexpected connections. The dataset showed that SARS-CoV-2 was brought to clients and staff at the Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program at least 7 times. Remarkably, 2 of those introductions also traced back to the biotech conference. Researchers also found infections in Chelsea, Revere, and Everett, which were some of the hardest hit communities in the Boston area, that were connected to the original superspreading event.

ref: Lemieux J, Siddle KJ, Shaw BM, et al. Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in the Boston area highlights the role of recurrent importation and superspreading events. Preprint. medRxiv. 2020; 2020.08.23.20178236. Published 2020 Aug 25. doi:10.1101/2020.08.23.20178236

Abstract
--------
SARS-CoV-2 has caused a severe, ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 in Massachusetts with 111 070 confirmed cases and 8 433 deaths as of [1 Aug 2020]. To investigate the introduction, spread, and epidemiology of COVID-19 in the Boston area, we sequenced and analyzed 772 complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the region, including nearly all confirmed cases within the 1st week of the epidemic and hundreds of cases from major outbreaks at a conference, a nursing facility, and among homeless shelter guests and staff. The data reveal over 80 introductions into the Boston area, predominantly from elsewhere in the United States and Europe. We studied 2 superspreading events covered by the data, events that led to very different outcomes because of the timing and populations involved. One produced rapid spread in a vulnerable population but little onward transmission, while the other was a major contributor to sustained community transmission, including outbreaks in homeless populations, and was exported to several other domestic and international sites. The same 2 events differed significantly in the number of new mutations seen, raising the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 superspreading might encompass disparate transmission dynamics. Our results highlight the failure of measures to prevent importation into Massachusetts early in the outbreak, underscore the role of superspreading in amplifying an outbreak in a major urban area, and lay a foundation for contact tracing informed by genetic data.

[Models of the COVID pandemic indicate that between 10 and 20 percent of infected people are responsible for 80 percent of the coronavirus's spread.

"Preventing superspreader events could go a long way toward stopping COVID-19, says Samuel Scarpino, a network scientist who studies infectious disease at Northeastern University. Scientists have identified factors that catalyze such events, including large crowd sizes, close contact between people, and confined spaces with poor ventilation. Current evidence suggests that it is mostly circumstances such as these, rather than the biology of specific individuals, that sets the stage for extreme spreading of the novel coronavirus.

"When describing how the SARS-CoV-2 virus spreads, epidemiologists not only use the average number of other people that one individual infects but also employ another key value called the dispersion factor, or "k." This number describes how much a disease clusters. A small k generally means that a relatively small number of cases are responsible for transmissions, while a larger k indicates that transmissions are more evenly spread. In Hong Kong, researchers calculated that in more than 1000 COVID-19 cases they examined, the value for k was 0.45. That value was higher than that of SARS or MERS--two previous viral outbreaks that featured superspreading -- but much lower than that of the 1918 flu pandemic. In other words, SARS-CoV-2's transmission is not as reliant on superspreading as SARS and MERS were but is far more dependent on it than influenza, Scarpino says.

"If people got sick right away after they were infected, they might stay at home in bed, giving them few opportunities to transmit the virus. Instead, individuals with COVID-19 are contagious before they have symptoms, says Lauren Ancel Meyers, executive director of the University of Texas at Austin COVID-19 Modeling Consortium. The CDC estimates that about 40 percent of transmissions occur before the infected person has any symptoms and that symptoms take an average of 6 days to begin. That time gives an infected individual a long window to come into contact with other people -- and to perhaps get into a situation ripe for superspreading.

"Researchers have identified several factors that make it easier for superspreading to happen. Some of them are environmental. For instance, poorly ventilated indoor areas seem especially conducive to the virus's spread.

"Another thing these superspreader venues have in common is that they are places where large numbers of people congregate.

"Time matters too. The longer a group stays in contact, the greater the likelihood that the virus will spread among them. Exactly how much time someone needs to pick it up remains an unanswered question, says Syra Madad, a special pathogens expert at NYC Health + Hospitals. She adds that the benchmark used for risk assessment in her contact-tracing work is 10 minutes of contact with an infectious person, though the CDC uses 15 minutes as a guideline.

"What people are doing matters, too, because some activities seem to make it easier to spread respiratory gunk." (from https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-superspreading-events-drive-most-covid-19-spread1/ 23 Jun 2020). - Mod.LK]

[2] Europe: 2nd wave?

Europe's fears of a coronavirus resurgence are becoming reality with France hitting a new peak and infections rising in Germany and the UK after a summer of lax containment.

Earlier lockdowns decimated European economies and authorities are resisting renewed nationwide restrictions on movement. Despite thousands of more cases, the situation is very different than in March and April [2020]. Death rates are rising more slowly, and hospitals are still able to treat the sick, easing pressure on European leaders to take drastic action.

The UK reported almost 3000 cases on Monday [7 Sep 2020] and case numbers in recent days rose to the highest since May. The increase has largely been attributed to younger people being infected, leading Health Secretary Matt Hancock to warn of the dangers of ignoring social-distancing rules, which could widen the spread. "People have relaxed too much, now is the time for us to re-engage, and to realize that this a continuing threat to us," Jonathan Van Tam, England's deputy chief medical officer, told the BBC on Monday evening. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been urging workers to return to offices and reopened schools in an attempt to kick-start the economy after the worst recession in at least a century. The government has already moved to introduce local lockdowns in areas where the virus is spreading. On Monday, the UK announced 14 days of self-isolation for travelers arriving from islands including Crete and Santorini.

Confirmed cases in France rose by 4203 on Monday [7 Sep 2020]. The 7-day rolling average has been rising steadily in recent weeks and surpassed 6000 on Friday [4 Sep 2020], above previous peaks in March and April. The number of COVID-19 deaths in France stayed well below the levels seen at the height of the pandemic 5 months ago. The French Health Ministry says the coronavirus is again spreading exponentially, and increased testing doesn't explain the jump in cases. Authorities say prevention measures have been applied less strictly, particularly by young adults, and possibly linked to a resumption of social interaction during the summer. The bulk of recent French infections are people between 15 and 44 years old. Among the elderly, who are more vulnerable but more disciplined at sticking to measures such as social distancing and mask wearing, cases have been rising more slowly, according to the Health Ministry. French Prime Minister Jean Castex has said the country can't afford another nationwide lockdown, favoring instead more targeted restrictions. France this month [September 2020] made masks mandatory for companies with groups of employees working in enclosed spaces, while cities from Paris to Marseille are enforcing face masks in outside spaces.

Germany registered 1898 new infections in the 24 hours through Tuesday morning [8 Sep 2020], the most since April, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. While that's a far cry from the almost 7000 daily cases recorded at the height of the pandemic, the country's public health authority warned that the situation continued to be "dynamic and serious." Fatalities remained below 10 on most days in the past few weeks, which compares to several hundred daily fatalities in April. There was one fatality in the 24 hours through Tuesday [8 Sep 2020]. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has warned that the coronavirus crisis will get worse before it gets better as she ruled out further easing steps. Instead, the country has recently stepped up enforcement of hygiene and distancing rules. Germany's national health authority said outbreaks continued to occur throughout the country, particularly in connection with celebrations with family and friends and at group events. Despite the recent uptick in infections, the public health service has ensured that Germany has kept the pandemic "largely under control," and hopefully can continue to do so, Merkel said Tuesday [8 Sep 2020] during a conference with regional and municipal health officials.

Spain reported 2440 new cases on Monday [7 Sep 2020], down from 4503 recorded Friday [4 Sep 2020]. While still below levels from the height of the crisis, when 8000 people a day caught the disease, children are returning to schools across Spain, fueling concern that numbers could again approach peak levels. In an attempt to contain the outbreak, the government of Madrid on Monday imposed an order to limit social gathering in public and private spaces to no more than 10 people. The region has for days recorded Spain's highest infection rates.

Italy, the original epicenter of the pandemic in Europe, is a bright spot, reporting 1108 infections on Monday [7 Sep 2020], compared with peak levels of over 6000.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

Data by country, area, or territory for 8 Sep 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesSept9_1599744260.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 29.6% of daily case numbers and 40.1% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, maintaining its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 14.2 million cases. The USA and Brazil remain dominant, followed by Argentina, Peru, Colombia, and Mexico.

- The European region reported 14.7% of daily case numbers and 12.2% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 4.6 million. Countries not reporting to WHO today [8 Sep 2020] include Kazakhstan, Israel, and Belgium. The dominant country is Spain, followed by France, Russia, the UK, Ukraine, Turkey, Germany, and Italy.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 7.7% of daily case numbers and 9.7% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of greater than 2 million cases. Iraq remains the dominant country, followed by Iran, Morocco, Libya, Kuwait, the Palestinian Authority, and Saudi Arabia.

- The African region reported 2.1% of daily case numbers and 3.7% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than one million cases. Ethiopia is now the dominant country, followed by South Africa, Algeria, Nigeria, Ghana, and Kenya.

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.9% of daily case numbers and 1.4% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.52 million cases. The Philippines continues to dominate, followed by Japan and South Korea.

- The South East Asia region reported 43.9% of the daily newly reported cases and 32.9% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 4.9 million cases. India continues to dominate followed by Indonesia, Bangladesh, and Nepal.

Europe, while experiencing resurgences in many countries related to loosening restrictions and the summer vacation period, is overshadowed by the major transmission ongoing in South East Asia, specifically India.

[The USA, India, and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations, with India now in the 2nd position followed by Brazil. In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (95 529), followed by the USA (35 244) and Brazil (34 208) -- account for over half of all confirmed cases globally (54.3%) and 57.5% of all newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. A global total of 6227 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (8-9 Sep 2020).

Countries reporting more than 5000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours include India, USA, Brazil, Argentina (12 259), Spain (8866), France (8577), Colombia (7343), Peru(6586), Mexico (5351) and Russia (5218), and 31 countries have reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours. 5 of the top 10 countries reporting the highest daily newly confirmed cases are from the Americas region and 7 of the top 20 countries reporting the highest daily newly confirmed cases are from the European region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is virtually no change (a decrease of 0.85%), while daily reported deaths have increased by 7.0%.

Impression: The European region is seeing increasing cases in western European countries that had markedly reduced transmission in late spring. The most severely affected region remains the Americas, even with the weekend reporting artifacts. - Mod.UBA]
