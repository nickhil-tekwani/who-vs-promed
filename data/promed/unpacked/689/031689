A human infection of the H7N9 strain of avian flu has been reported in central China's Hubei Province.

With severe pneumonia and sepsis, the patient has suffered multiple organ failure and is being treated in isolation, said the provincial health and family planning commission on Mon 14 Mar 2016.

The patient is a trader of live poultry and was formally diagnosed on Sun 13 Mar 2016, the commission said.

H7N9 was 1st reported to have infected humans in China in March 2013. It is most likely to strike in winter and spring.

From September 2015 to 1 Feb 2016, 44 H7N9 human cases, including 10 deaths, have been reported in China, 70 fewer cases than the same period a year ago, according to the National Health and Family Planning Commission.

The decrease of reported cases has been attributed to tougher control of live poultry markets.

[FluTracker's H7N9 line listing (http:flutrackers.com/forum/forum/china-h7n9-outbreak-tracking/143874-flutrackers-2013-16-human) currently shows 78 cases of H7N9 for the winter of 2015-16. This is the 2nd human case reported in Hubei since H7N9 emerged in China in 2013. Most of these infections have been associated with contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments (such as poultry markets) in China.

Hubei is a province of China located in the easternmost part of central China. It is located north of Dongting Lake. The provincial capital is Wuhan, a major transportation thoroughfare and the political, cultural, and economic hub of Central China. - Mod.LK]

Abstract
------
Background:
Three epidemic waves of influenza A(H7N9) (hereafter H7N9) human cases have occurred between March 2013 and July 2015 in China. However, the underlying transmission mechanism remains unclear. Our main objective is to use mathematical models to study how seasonality, secular changes and environmental transmission play a role in the spread of H7N9 in China.

Methods:
Data on human cases and chicken cases of H7N9 infection were downloaded from the EMPRES-i Global Animal Disease Information System. We modelled on chicken-to-chicken transmission, assuming a constant ratio of 10-6 human cases per chicken cases, and compared whether the model fit with the observed human cases. We developed 3 different modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-Susceptible models: (i) a non-periodic transmission rate model with an environmental class, (ii) a non-periodic transmission rate model without an environmental class, and (iii) a periodic transmission rate model with an environmental class. We then estimated the key epidemiological parameters and compared whether the model fit using Akaike Information Criterion and Bayesian Information Criterion.

Results:
Our results showed that a non-periodic transmission rate model with an environmental class provided the best model fit to the observed human cases in China during the study period. The estimated parameter values were within biologically plausible ranges.

Conclusions:
This study highlighted the importance of considering secular changes and environmental transmission in the modelling of human H7N9 cases. Secular changes were most likely due to control measures such as Live Poultry Markets closures that were implemented during the initial phase of the outbreaks in China. Our results suggested that environmental transmission via viral shedding of infected chickens had contributed to the spread of H7N9 human cases in China.

[This study extends the models built on the 1st 2 waves of H7N9 transmission in China to include the 3rd wave. Note that secular variation of a time series is its long-term non-periodic variation. Gaps identified in the model indicate that more research is needed to determine environmental transmission routes of H7N9 in China.
