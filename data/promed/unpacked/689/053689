Tick-borne illness continues to spread across NC
---------------------------------------------
The CDC released numbers for diseases and deaths in the past year ending in
Aug 2004. One number that stands out is for Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, a
tick-borne illness. Officials said cases have more than doubled.
Many people have kept their guard up against mosquitoes and the possibility
of getting West Nile virus, but health experts are stressing not to forget
about ticks. Ticks from dogs are the most common in the state and the main
carrier of Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Dr. Nolan Newton, chief of pest
management in the state, said the disease is spreading beyond central North
Carolina, further eastward into the coastal plain.
"We went from about 97 cases this time in 2003 to over 200 cases so far
this year," he said.
Ticks are most common in medium to tall grass and shrubs. They usually
hitch a ride on clothing and look for skin, where they can find blood.
To avoid ticks, experts suggest wearing long sleeves and long pants and
using repellents. They also say to check your body frequently, especially
your scalp and behind the neck and ears. It is also important not to panic
if you find one.

[In the USA, the middle Atlantic states remain the major area for human
cases of RMSF. The vector in this area is usually the dog tick,
_Dermacentor variabilis_. Prompt recognition and removal of feeding female
ticks will generally prevent infection and prompt treatment will prevent
mortality. It should be recalled that inadvertent treatment with
sulfonamide antimicrobials exacerbates rickettsial infections. - Mod.LL]
