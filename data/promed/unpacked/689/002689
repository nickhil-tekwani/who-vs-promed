Acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) has started taking its toll on children in Bihar following the rise in temperature, which is considered conducive for the spread of the viral disease. In the last 3 days, 2 children with symptoms of AES have been admitted to Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) in Muzaffarpur.

"The reports of the fresh cases of suspected AES are awaited. They have been admitted to the preventive intensive care unit ward and are under close observation of a senior doctor of the hospital," said Dr Gopal Shanker Sahani, head of paediatrics department of SKMCH.

The SKMCH has already earmarked 100 beds for AES patients. On Monday [14 Mar 2022], the hospital released a roster of 30 doctors to deal with the AES cases, which have started being reported with the rise in summer temperature.

Also, special training has been imparted to 2 doctors each for the AES-affected districts. Muzaffarpur, Vaishali, Sitamarhi, East Champaran, and Samastipur in north Bihar have been identified as worst affected by the AES. Five blocks -- Minapur, Kanti, Musahari, Kudhani, and Bochaha -- in Muzaffarpur had earlier recorded maximum AES cases.

Nodal officer Satish Kumar said preparations were made in advance to deal with the AES, which severely affects children in the age group of 6 months to 15 years during summer. "All the health facilities in the AES-hit areas have been put on alert," he added.

In 2021, 11 out of 51 AES-affected children admitted to the SKMCH had died. In 2019, altogether 164 children had died due to AES in Muzaffarpur and its surrounding districts. Blistering heat and humidity are considered favourable for the virus. The authorities have already started awareness campaign in the worst-hit areas asking people to take precautionary measures.

[The measures taken in advance of the Japanese encephalitis and AES season are prudent since cases occur there every year in Bihar state. The 2 cases mentioned above are likely to be a warning for tens of cases yet to come over the next 6 months. The above report mentions AES as a viral disease. However, as mentioned in many previous ProMED posts, the issue of the etiology of AES has been under discussion for a long time. AES has continued to be attributed to various etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible JE, enterovirus infection from polluted water, heatstroke, scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_), and intoxication from lychee fruit consumption. Dr T Jacob John noted that hypoglycemic encephalopathy is triggered by litchi consumption. A recent publication states that dengue virus is one of the 3 commonest agents identified in AES, but existing surveillance for AES does not include routine testing for dengue. - Mod.TY
