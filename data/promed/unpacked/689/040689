Viet Nam reports H5N1 fatality
---------------------------------------
Health officials in Viet Nam said today [Wed 23 Jan 2008] that a
32-year-old man has died of H5N1 avian influenza, signaling the
country's 1st reported case and death of the new year [2008]. The man
was from northern Viet Nam's Tuyen Quang province, about 50 miles
northwest of Hanoi, the Associated Press (AP) reported today. If his
case is confirmed by the World Health Organization (WHO), he will be
listed as Viet Nam's 102nd case-patient and its 48th fatality from the disease.
To Doan Hong, of the provincial Preventive Medicine Center, told the
AP that the man died last week [14-18 Jan 2008], 2 days after he was
admitted to the nation's tropical disease hospital in Hanoi. Hong
said the man got sick after slaughtering and cooking geese and
chickens that had died in his backyard farm on 9 Jan 2008, according
to the AP report. Samples from poultry were also positive for the
virus, he said. Samples from the man's family and neighbors have
tested negative for the H5N1 virus, and officials have disinfected
the man's house, along with areas in his neighborhood, Hong told the AP.
Tuyen Quang is one of 4 provinces that are currently on the
Vietnamese government's avian flu watch list, the AP report said.
Viet Nam's last human H5N1 case was confirmed by the WHO on 28 Dec
2007. The patient was a 4-year-old boy from Son La province who died
on 16 Dec 2007 after 5 days in the hospital. The WHO had said the
source of the boy's infection was still under investigation. The
country has the 2nd-highest avian flu case count, after Indonesia.
In other developments, the WHO today confirmed Indonesia's latest
H5N1 case, that of a 32-year-old man from Tangerang, a suburb of
Jakarta, who is being treated in a Jakarta hospital. His case raises
the WHO's H5N1 count for Indonesia to 120 cases with 97 deaths; the
global count is 352 cases with 219 deaths. The man got sick on 13 Jan
2008 and was hospitalized 6 days later, according to a statement from
the WHO. Investigators are trying to determine the source of his
infection. According to a report yesterday [22 Jan 2008] from
Indonesia's National Committee for Avian Influenza Control and
Pandemic Influenza Preparedness, the man is a sales executive at an
automobile company.

(3) Indonesia - swallows as vectors
Date: Thu 24 Jan 2008

Re: Swallows as vectors
-------------------------------
I was interested to read that the history of the recent patient in
Tangerang was being investigated with testing for swallow and chicken
vectors [see Avian influenza, human (14): Indonesia 20080123.027].
I am a physician working in Indonesia, site of [one of the human
cases] of avian influenza. [Identification of the source of this
case's infection was ongoing and included investigation into a large
swallow farm in close proximity to the case's house. - Mods.CP/MPP].
There was a lot of press speculation regarding swallows as vectors at
the time and the testing was centered around testing live swallows
only. These came out negative.
The investigation fell short and initially did not include testing of
the geese in the area. The community was in a panic and began burning
tires to scare away the swallows being raised in a village building
for their nests. Large crowds gathered around the area for days in
protest. Later testing of the geese (burung angsa) showed that all 8
of them tested positive for the virus and they were then removed and
killed, without any manifestation of disease. It is a shame that
further follow up on this data was not sent to ProMED-mail, but
seemed to follow the momentum of the community. There is a quickness
to reach a cause or diagnosis, then stick to that despite data to the contrary.

A correspondent in Indonesia (name withheld)
[Mod.TY commented previously that the swallows concerned are
undoubtedly the bird nest soup swiftlets (_Collocalia fuciphaga_,
although its specific and subspecific taxonomic status is debated),
raised for their very expensive nests. Indonesia exports 27 tonnes of
nests annually, which indicates the magnitude of this industry. The
status of the swiftlets as H5N1 virus hosts is unknown and the
results of the investigation will be of interest. Images of these
birds and their nests can be seen at
<http://10000birds.com/edible-nest-swiftlets.htm>.
The comment of our correspondent in Indonesia indicates that H5N1
virus has not so far been recovered from live swallows. - Mod.CP]
