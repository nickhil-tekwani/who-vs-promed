Re the association of yersiniosis, infants and chitlins: New York State
Agriculture and Markets food inspectors and Department of Health officials
often notice an increase in the numbers of outbreaks in African-American
children traced to chitlins and caused by Yersenia enterocolitica and other
harmful bacteria in November and December-the traditional holiday times
when chitlins are prepared in homes. [How many cases is the holiday peak?
Is the increased incidence actually due to outbreaks or a general rise in
occurence with increased purchase of chitlins? - Mod. pc]
Chitlins are the small intestine of pigs from which the inner lining has
been stripped; this leaves the muscle and the "crown," (the ileal-cecal
valve area). They are purchased raw in grocery stores or at meat
processing plants. The USDA requires that chitlins be washed out, but this
is not well enforced so the intestines can contain traces of digesta and
fecal matter and can be the source of harmful bacteria.
When the consumer prepares them at home, they are washed and dried, often
by stretching them around something like the legs of a table. Later they
are cooked according to traditional recipes. Children can touch them where
they are stretched to dry or come in contact with fecal matter on the hands
of adults who have handled the intestines and have not adequately washed
their hands afterwards. It is not clear why the outbreaks are most often
seen in children and not so much in adults.
NYS Agriculture and Markets officials have met to help plan food safety
publicity about this health issue and their Department of Food Safety and
Inspection has prepared educational leaflets for grocers to drop into the
shopping bags of patrons who purchase chitlins. Agriculture and Markets
officials would prefer that people buy chitlins precooked, but so far
consumers have resisted this proposed change in the traditional preparation
of the product.
Ann Peterson of the Georgia Department of Health recently reported a study
in which they assessed the effect of preboiling chitlins before cleaning
and preparing them on texture and flavor (No adverse effect). They also
studied effective, appropriate ways to get out this educational message to
their test groups; the messages were liked by the target audience, were
simple and low cost, and addressed the barriers to behavior change and the
audience concerns. The targets were the chitlin preparers, community
leaders and gatekeepers, and health care providers.
