A life-threatening, flesh-eating bacteria is spreading in northern Stockholm, where hospital staff have recorded an immense spike in the number of cases in recent years. "The disease is one of the most dramatic conditions that we see in orthopedic surgery. It has an extremely quick onset which can make it seem truly dramatic," Olof Sklodenberg, orthopedist at the hospital, told the Dagens Medicin newspaper.

Necrotizing fasciitis, more commonly known as flesh-eating disease, is an extremely aggressive bacteria that can kill a human in less than a day. The disease attacks the tissue and the deeper layers of skin, and can have a sudden onset. All infected tissue must be removed immediately for an infected person to survive.

In northern Stockholm's Danderyd Hospital, 23 cases of the disease have been recorded between 2010 and 2012. During the previous 2-year period, only one case had been reported by the hospital. "This is a huge increase. It could be because it has become easier to identify the condition, but we think it's rather due to a genuine increase," Skoldenberg added. A nationwide investigation has been launched to determine whether the disease is spreading further than just in Stockholm.

As to why the disease is now showing increased signs of infection, the paper noted that it may be due to the bacteria becoming stronger, or people's immune system not reacting as strongly to it.

The disease, in which sufferers can lose limbs or be opened from the waist to the foot, affects 0.4 people per 100 000 in the western world. It can be caught through eating undercooked meat, proximity to human sewage when used as fertilizer, or sharing used needles.

[Necrotizing fasciitis, also called "flesh-eating disease" is a rapidly progressive infection that destroys the soft tissues covering muscle (fascia). Most commonly the pathogen enters the body through a break in the skin, like a cut, scrape, burn, insect bite, or puncture wound. Most people who get necrotizing fasciitis have other health problems that include diabetes, kidney disease, cancer, or other chronic health conditions that weaken the body's immune system.

Patients usually complain of intense pain in the involved region that initially may seem out of proportion to the external appearance of the overlying skin. Aggressive surgical debridement of all necrotic tissue and administration of antibiotics are necessary. However, surgical intervention is often delayed after hospital admission, because these infections can be difficult to recognize in their early stages, and deep muscle necrosis may not be appreciated early on. The commonest type of bacteria causing necrotizing fasciitis is _Streptococcus pyogenes_ (group A streptococcus or GAS), but fungi (such as mucor) and other bacteria, such as _Aeromonas hydrophila_ (http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/562854), _Vibrio vulnificus_, _Staphylococcus aureus_, and mixtures of multiple aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species, can cause necrotizing fasciitis.

Although the specific microbial etiology of the Stockholm outbreak is not specified in the news release above, GAS are the most common causes of necrotizing fasciitis. Each year in the U.S., GAS cause about 650-800 cases of necrotizing fasciitis (an incidence rate of about 0.2 per 100 000) and the CDC says that the incidence is not rising (http://www.cdc.gov/features/necrotizingfasciitis/).

Most cases of necrotizing fasciitis likely occur randomly and are not linked to similar infections in others. However, GAS infections can be highly contagious: skin lesions, poor personal hygiene, and crowded conditions, e.g., in shelters for the homeless, would be expected to facilitate GAS spread from person to person. Some strains of GAS are more virulent than others. Streptococcal M protein is the major virulence factor of GAS, which has been divided into serotypes based on the antigenic differences in the M protein molecule. GAS are now typed on the basis of sequence analysis of the portion of the emm gene that encodes M serospecificity
(http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/biotech/strep/M-ProteinGene_typing.htm). Genotyping identified GAS genotype emm-59 in half of the cases in an outbreak of invasive GAS disease among the homeless and intravenous drug users in Thunder Bay, Ontario (ProMED-mail post Streptococcus, group A, emm-59, fatal - Canada: (ON) Archive Number: 20081011.3219).

A description of the microbial etiology of the cases involved, patient characteristics, and any epidemiologic linkages among the patients would be appreciated. - Mod.ML
