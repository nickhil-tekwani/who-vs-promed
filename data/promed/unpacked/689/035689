[1] HPA press release
Date: 13 Feb 2013

The Health Protection Agency (HPA) can confirm a further case of novel coronavirus infection in a family member of the case announced on Monday [11 Feb 2013]. The patient, who is a UK resident, does not have any recent travel history and is currently receiving intensive care treatment at The Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham. It is understood that this patient has an existing medical condition that may make them more susceptible to respiratory infections. This latest case brings the total number of confirmed cases globally to 11, of which 3 have been diagnosed in the UK.

Professor John Watson, head of the respiratory diseases department at the HPA, said: "Confirmed novel coronavirus infection in a person without travel history to the Middle East suggests that person-to-person transmission has occurred and that it occurred in the UK. This case is a family member who was in close personal contact with the earlier case and who may have been at greater risk of acquiring an infection because of their underlying health condition. To date, evidence of person-to-person transmission has been limited. Although this case provides strong evidence for person to person transmission, the risk of infection in most circumstances is still considered to be very low. If novel coronavirus were more infectious, we would have expected to have seen a larger number of cases than we have seen since the 1st case was reported 3 months ago. However, this new development does justify the measures that were immediately put into place to prevent any further spread of infection and to identify and follow up contacts of known cases. We will continue to provide advice and support to healthcare workers looking after the patients and to contacts of both cases. In light of this latest case, we would like to emphasise that the risk associated with novel coronavirus to the general UK population remains very low. The HPA will continue to work closely with national and international health authorities and will share any further advice with health professionals and the public if and when more information becomes available."

Notes to editors:

Laboratory confirmed cases to date: 11
Saudi Arabia: 5 (3 deaths)
Jordan: 2 (2 deaths)
UK: 3 (1 patient from Qatar - receiving treatment, 2 patients from UK, 1 with recent travel to Pakistan and Saudi Arabia - both receiving treatment)
Germany: 1 (patient from Qatar - discharged)

Coronaviruses are causes of the common cold but can also include more severe illness, such as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). This new coronavirus was 1st identified in September 2012 in a patient who died from a severe respiratory infection in June 2012. The virus has so far only been identified in a small number of cases of acute, serious respiratory illness who presented with fever, cough, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties.

For further information, see the HPA's coronavirus web pages, which include a Q&A page on this topic [see http://www.hpa.org.uk/webw/HPAweb&Page&HPAwebAutoListName/Page/1317136202637].

[2] ECDC Update
Date: 13 Feb 2013

http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/press/news/Lists/News/ECDC_DispForm.aspx?List=32e43ee8-e230-4424-a783-85742124029a&ID=844&RootFolder=%2Fen%2Fpress%2Fnews%2FLists%2FNews


Epidemiological update: Case of severe lower respiratory tract disease associated with a novel coronavirus:

On [13 Feb 2013], the HPA announced that one family contact of the previously-confirmed case reported on [11 Feb 2013] was laboratory-confirmed to be infected with the novel coronavirus (NCoV). This 2nd case from the same family was hospitalised on [9 Feb 2013] with a short history of respiratory symptoms. The patient has an existing medical condition that may make him more susceptible to respiratory infections. He does not have a recent travel history and is currently receiving intensive care treatment.

The cases have been notified through the EU alerting system for communicable diseases.

This brings the total of laboratory-confirmed cases of severe pneumonia caused by the NCoV to 11 globally (see table below).

The information available suggests human-to-human transmission of the NCoV in this family cluster.

The HPA reports that surveillance of family, close contacts of the 2 patients, and healthcare workers treating the 2 patients is ongoing, as per the UK National Guidelines. None are currently presenting with symptoms consistent with NCoV.

The HPA is also following-up regarding passengers who may have been exposed while flying with the case announced on [11 Feb 2013] and are in contact with the airline concerned.

In light of this human-to-human transmission of the NCoV within the family cluster, ECDC is now updating its risk assessment, previously published on [7 Dec 2012].

[3] WHO GAR update

Novel coronavirus infection - update [13 Feb 2013]:

The United Kingdom (UK) has informed WHO of another confirmed case of infection with the novel coronavirus (NCoV). The patient is a UK resident and a relative of the case announced on [11 Feb 2013].

The latest confirmed case does not have any recent travel history outside the UK and is currently hospitalized in an intensive care unit. It is understood that this patient has pre-existing medical conditions that may have increased susceptibility to respiratory infections.

Confirmed NCoV in a person without recent travel history indicates that infection was acquired in the UK. To date, evidence of person-to-person transmission has been limited. Although this case is suggestive of person-to-person transmission, on the basis of current evidence, the risk of sustained person-to-person transmission appears to be very low.

The Health Protection Agency (HPA) is following up on all close contacts (family and healthcare workers) who may have been exposed to either of these 2 new confirmed cases.

As of [13 Feb 2013], a total of 11 confirmed cases of human infection with NCoV have been notified to WHO, with no change in the number of fatalities i.e., 5 deaths since April 2012.

Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns. Testing for the new coronavirus should be considered in patients with unexplained pneumonias, or in patients with unexplained severe, progressive, or complicated respiratory illness not responding to treatment.

Any clusters of SARI or SARI in healthcare workers should be thoroughly investigated, regardless of where in the world they occur.

New cases and clusters of the NCoV should be reported promptly both to national health authorities and to WHO.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied.

WHO continues to monitor the situation closely.

Communicated by:
ProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp

[The above mentioned case of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) is currently the 11th confirmed case of severe respiratory disease attributable to infection with the novel CoV 1st identified in a fatal case in Saudi Arabia (see prior ProMED-mail posts listed below). It is also the 3rd incident of infection with this novel CoV that occurred in a close contact of an earlier confirmed case, suggesting possible person to person transmission of the virus. There was a cluster of 3 confirmed cases in a family in Saudi Arabia in November 2012 and a cluster of 2 confirmed cases among ICU staff in a hospital in Jordan in May 2012. As stated clearly in the 3 reports of this update, evidence thus far does not seem to suggest an ease and facility of person-to-person contact of this organism as yet.

The table of cases presented in the ECDC report above is a very useful presentation and summary of the current publicly available information on the descriptive epidemiology of known confirmed cases of severe acute respiratory illness due to infection with this novel CoV. Information on exposure histories of each of the patients is not available (some of the earlier cases were reported to have had contact with farm animals in Saudi Arabia and Qatar, but similar information was not available on all cases). To date, cases that have been confirmed have been linked to geographic presence in the Middle East prior to onset of illness (Jordan, Saudi Arabia or Qatar; with one case also having visited Pakistan during the period prior to onset of illness). The absence of cases reported from other areas among individuals without history of contact with this region of the world may or may not reflect the true geographic distribution of this novel CoV, as there may be a bias against testing for this virus in the absence of such stated exposure history ("seek and ye shall find," or the corollary, "don't look and you won't find").

The scientific community is eagerly awaiting the details of epidemiologic investigations conducted on the 11 previously confirmed cases of infection with the novel CoV, especially those addressing exposure to possible animal sources (bats, bat saliva and excrement, farm animals, etc.) and dates of contacts/dates of onset of previous clusters. In addition, information on field studies on bats and farm animals in the Middle Eastern countries addressing infection of animals with the novel CoV is eagerly awaited as well.
