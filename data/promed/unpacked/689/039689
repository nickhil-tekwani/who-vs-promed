I would like to comment on your comment below (Dengue/DHF -
Venezuela: epidemiology & control):
>In Barrera's judgment, the dengue fever epidemic demonstrates
deficiencies in control services... The only way to control the epidemic
is to create special units that include physicians, biologists, ecologists,
and experts in vector ecology who can take action. Such units do not
exist in Venezuela.
>[In fact, you don´t really need all that -- you just need a proper system
for disposal of solid waste (including discarded automobile tires, prime
breeding sites), and a community willing to eliminate water from all
small containers in and around their houses. - Mod.JW<

First: The main larval habitat of _Aedes aegypti_ in Venezuela is the
metal drum and other water-storing devices. Tires are also important,
but not as important as man-filled containers, including flower vases
and plant pots ( Barrera, R., Navarro, J.C., Mora, J.D., Domínguez, D.
and González, J. Deficiencia de los servicios públicos y abundancia de
Aedes aegypti en Venezuela. Boletín de la Oficina Panamericana
Sanitaria. 118:410-423. 1995. (Public Service Deficiencies and Aedes
aegypti in Venezuela. Bulletin of the Pan American Health Organization
29(3): 193-205. 1995.)
Second: Third World countries do not have organizations such as the
Mosquito Control Districts of the United States, and unlike those, to
fight dengue you need a lot of community involvement and education.
Those are the types of units I am promoting in Venezuela. Health
authorities react only during outbreaks when generally there is not
much to do. Preventive, sustained source reduction is the key to
eliminate dengue epidemics. Without the right organization nobody
ever is going to bring dengue under control, particularly where water
storing and garbage collection are the main problems.
