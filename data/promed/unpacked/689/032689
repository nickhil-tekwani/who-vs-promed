An end to mass slaughter: ministers to back foot & mouth vaccine
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The vaccination of cows, pigs and sheep against foot & mouth disease is set
to be sanctioned by ministers after the mass slaughter and 8 billion UK
pounds [approx 12.2 trillion US dollars] cost of last year's epidemic.
Two government reports being published next month will herald fundamental
changes in the way that future outbreaks are handled. The U-turn will anger
many farmers who fear that vaccination will jeopardise millions of pounds in
exports. Consumer groups and food businesses have also suggested that it
could lead to products being labelled with disease warnings.
However, The Times has learnt that an official scientific inquiry headed by
Sir Brian Follett for the Royal Society will recommend scrapping the
slaughter policy which saw 10 million animals killed and the devastation of
Britain's rural economy last year. Instead, the report will say that healthy
animals should be vaccinated to prevent the disease spreading, and that
there is no reason why meat or other products from such livestock cannot
then be sold on supermarket shelves.
The Follett inquiry's recommendations are likely to be accepted by Margaret
Beckett, Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Secretary, next month. Senior
government figures say the taxpayer and the tourism industry cannot be
expected to pay the price for saving a meat export market worth less than
100 million UK pounds, a fraction of the outbreak's cost last year.
The Netherlands used vaccination to control the spread of outbreaks last
year [2001], but later slaughtered the animals and destroyed their carcasses
to regain the disease-free status needed for exports within the European
Union. However, ministers believe that the EU, which is conducting its own
inquiries into livestock vaccination, can be persuaded to adopt the new
policy.
There is also growing optimism about new synthetic vaccines being developed
which, unlike existing products, do not carry any risk of contaminating
healthy animals. This could lead to routine vaccinations of livestock at
birth, a practice which previously led to import of meat from countries such
as Argentina being banned or heavily restricted.
Elliot Morley, the Animal Health Minister, told The Times last night: "I am
a firm advocate for vaccination as part of a contingency plan. I only want
to have a policy of 'vaccinate to live' -- otherwise what is the point?" He
said that for the moment "blanket vaccination of every animal in Britain"
would be difficult because there are so many strains of the disease [virus]
and would make it difficult to export meat [there are 7 different types of
FMD virus. - Mod.JW]. The minister insisted that objections from consumer
groups and retailers to selling meat and dairy produce from vaccinated
animals could be overcome.
During last year's epidemic, Mr Morley prepared a plan for Downing Street on
vaccinating animals. However, he was opposed by Ben Gill, the National
Farmers' Union leader, as well as business and consumer groups. At the
height of the epidemic, a meeting with Tony Blair at Chequers which included
Mr Gill, supermarket chiefs and food processing firms, finally rejected the
plan.
Since then the Government has faced sustained criticism over its handling of
the crisis, which cost the taxpayer 3 billion UK pounds and the private
sector -- including tourism -- a further 5 billion.
The Government's second inquiry into the epidemic, headed by Iain Anderson,
a former Unilever executive, is expected to be published on 18 Jul 2002, the
same week as the Royal Society report. Mr Brown, who was moved from
Agriculture to the Department of Work and Pensions after the election, is
believed to have been singled out for failing to take decisive action to
prevent the outbreak turning into an epidemic. However, he is understood to
have persuaded Dr Anderson to tone down some of his comments. The final
report is likely to acknowledge that ministers were facing a virtually
unprecedented situation and had to make decisions under intense pressure.
Ministers yesterday were reeling after a breach of disease controls was
uncovered. Mr Morley said he was horrified and blamed "rogues" in the
industry. He has called an urgent meeting with pig farmers next week to
discuss the findings and to urge them to root out any cowboy farmers. He is
angry that 10 days after a pig was identified with suspected foot & mouth
disease, vets have been unable to track down the owner. A criminal
investigation is now underway at the Department for Environment, Food and
Rural Affairs. The pig was spotted at Dawkins International abattoir in
Congerstone, Leicestershire and was one of 66 collected from Selby market on
Wednesday last week. This pig and some of the consignment had no
identification marks on them. Some 34 farmers from Yorkshire, had sent pigs
to the market that day, but no one has confessed to being the owner of the
animal.

[The British Government announced last year 3 independent inquiries on the
2001 FMD outbreak, which would report to the Prime Minister and the
Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). The
inquiries were:
1. Policy Commission on the Future of Farming and Food, as pledged by the
Government, chaired by Sir Don Curry.
2. Scientific review by the Royal Society of questions relating to the
transmission, prevention and control of epidemic outbreaks of infectious
disease in livestock, chaired by Sir Brian Follett FRS;
3. Inquiry into the lessons to be learned from the foot & mouth disease
outbreak of 2001 and the way the Government should handle any future major
animal disease outbreak, chaired by Dr Iain Anderson.
The terms of reference and timetables of the three inquiries can be seen at
<http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/page316.asp>.
The first inquiry reported to the government in December 2001. The other 2
are expected to do so during the second half of July 2002.
This news item from The Times includes details about both due inquiries; we
have presented in our posting only the ones related to the Royal Society
report since it deals with the vaccination issue, while the "lessons to be
learned" one does not. It will be interesting to follow both reports when
published. -Mod. AS]
