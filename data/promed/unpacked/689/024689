From: Abul Kalam Azad <akazad@medinet.agni.com>

Today I met Dr. A. M. Zakir Hussain, Director, Primary Health Care &
Disease Control (Bangladesh). He told me that he instructed the Civil
Surgeon (District Health Manager) at Kushtia to feedback him with detailed
information regarding the claim of epidemic outbreak of jaundice there. The
Civil Surgeon called him back and informed that no record of such jaundice
epidemic in government [or in NGO health facilities were found. So, they
are surprised at the news published in the Daily Star and have questioned
the validity of the news.
