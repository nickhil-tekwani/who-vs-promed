[2] Liberia: successful strategy

An Ebola strategy brings good news to one Liberian town
-------------------------------------------------------
In one corner of Liberia, a community has come together to change the course of the Ebola epidemic. New cases have been brought to a standstill. But this success shows that it's going to take more than extra beds in a ward to stop Ebola.

When Doctors Without Borders [MSF] arrived in the northern district of Foya in early August [2014], Ebola was out of control. Foya was the 1st area in Liberia to report cases, and the community has been hit hard. "At the peak, there were 125 patients in the center," says Katy Athersuch, the local communications officer for Doctors Without Borders." Since then, a lot has changed in this district, which borders Guinea and Sierra Leone. There have been no new cases in Foya for nearly a month -- although patients are still arriving from other areas, including the district of Voinjama only 40 miles up the road.

Health workers say there are 2 main reasons the epidemic here has been brought under control. One is this care center, which means sick people aren't at home infecting other people. The other is a massive campaign to connect with the community and to distribute information. This work has been conducted by both local health leaders and Doctors Without Borders staff.

Before the medical aid group arrived, people were terrified, says Sylvester Seyoe, a health promoter who lives in Foya. "Every day, all day, you [were] seeing people carrying dead body, dead body, dead body," he says. People weren't just afraid of Ebola. They were afraid of the health care workers, who looked like astronauts and took bodies away in ambulances.

Many people thought the workers were collecting bodies to sell the organs, Seyoe says: "'Oh, these guys [are] only coming to slaughter people and conduct ritualistic acts and make money out of us.' Because of that, people resisted."

So Doctors Without Borders and the local Ebola team put in a new system. Every time an ambulance went to collect a patient or body, they sent a health promoter, like Seyoe and Jayah, to stand outside the house and explain to neighbors what was happening.

One of the most important changes was allowing family members to see the body of someone who died of Ebola, says James Timothy Nah, a mental health counselor at the Ebola center. The center even has a viewing area where visitors can see the faces of health care workers before they put on masks, goggles and other protective gear. And just a few weeks ago, the staff at the center installed a cellphone booth where patients can make calls to their friends and relatives. All these changes have made a big difference in stemming the epidemic here.

Ebola appeared to retreat once before in this area, only to return with frightening speed, says Katy Athersuch of Doctors Without Borders. The group is determined to make sure that doesn't happen again.

[3] Liberia: infections slowing?

Ebola crisis: Infections slowing in Liberia
-------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization (WHO) says there has been a decline in the [rate of] spread of Ebola in Liberia, the country hardest hit in the outbreak. But WHO's Bruce Aylward said: "A slight decrease in cases ... versus getting this thing closed out is a completely different ball game." But he warned against any suggestion that the crisis was over.

The WHO said the number of cases globally had risen since its last report by more than 3000 to 13 703, but that [much of] this was due to reporting reasons. However, the number of deaths was put at 4920, roughly the same as the last report 4 days ago. All but 10 of the deaths have been in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.

The latest WHO figure of 13 703 cases is a significant leap on its previous situation report on Saturday [25 Oct 2014], which had showed cases rising above 10 000 for the 1st time -- to 10 141. But Dr Aylward, the WHO's assistant director general, said that [much of] this increase was due to data being updated with old cases, rather than new cases being reported.

Saturday's [25 Oct 2014] situation report put the death toll at 4922. The similar death toll in the latest report was mainly a result of a revision of the Liberian statistics. Cases there rose from 4655 to 6535, but reported deaths dropped from 2705 to 2413. Reported deaths in Guinea rose from 926 to 997 and in Sierra Leone from 1281 to 1500 [a suspiciously round number - Mod.JW].

Dr Aylward said: "It appears that the trend of a slowing in the rate of new case reporting is real in Liberia ... and there had been a huge effort to inform the population about the disease, to change the behaviours that put them at risk. There had been a real step up in the work to put in place safe burials." But the data was still being examined and [he] cautioned against thinking the crisis was over ... -- more

[4] West Africa: asymptomatic infection & acquired immunity

Ebola control: effect of asymptomatic infection and acquired immunity
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Evidence suggests that many Ebola infections are asymptomatic, a factor overlooked by recent outbreak summaries and projections. Particularly, results from one post-Ebola outbreak serosurvey showed that 71 percent of seropositive individuals did not have the disease; another study reported that 46 percent of asymptomatic close contacts of patients with Ebola were seropositive. Although asymptomatic infections are unlikely to be infectious, they might confer protective immunity and thus have important epidemiological consequences. Asymptomatic infection contributes to herd immunity and thereby dampens epidemic spread ... -- more
