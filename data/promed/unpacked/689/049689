TOMATO SPOTTED WILT, TOMATO - USA (MA): CORRECTION
*********************************
A ProMED-mail post

Readers noted 2 errors in the posting referred to below. I erred in
designating INSV as "iris necrotic spot virus." To my knowledge there
is no ICTV-approved virus with that name. INSV is Impatiens necrotic
spot tospovirus.
The second error was my assumption that the tomato crop was a
greenhouse crop. Tomato transplants were indeed raised in a
greenhouse in the presence of the ornamentals listed, but were then
transplanted outside. The disease was not observed until 3 weeks after
planting outdoors.
I am indebted to Rob Wick (Microbiology Department, University of
Massachusetts, Amherst, MA) and Simon Scott (Department of Plant
Pathology & Physiology, Clemson University, Clemson, SC) for
spotting the errors. I sincerely apologize to readers of ProMED-Plant
for the confusion.
