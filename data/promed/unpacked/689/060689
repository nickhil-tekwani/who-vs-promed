An outbreak of bird flu in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
last week has been put under control and no human infection was reported,
according to the regional government. As of zero hour on 2 Oct 2006, no new
deaths of poultry and no human cases of bird flu were reported, a regional
government spokesman said on Monday.
Nearly 1000 chickens and ducks reportedly died suddenly in a poultry farm
in the village of Xincheng in the Jiuyuan District of Baotou city on 27
Sep. The national avian influenza laboratory later confirmed that the H5N1
virus was found in samples taken from the dead poultry.
The owner of the farm and his wife bought some 5400 chickens and ducks
between 21 Aug and 20 Sep from other places in the county. The couple found
more than 70 chickens and ducks dead in the evening of 20 Sep. Dead
chickens and ducks were also found in the following days and the death toll
rose to 985 as of 27 Sep, when the couple reported the case to the
veterinarian station in Baotou city. Baotou city veterinarian station later
reported the case and sent samples of the dead poultry to the Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Regional Animal Epidemic Disease Control Center and the
national avian influenza laboratory.
The local agricultural department immediately quarantined the infected
area. The owner and his wife were also quarantined and people who had close
contact with them were under observation.
To date, 17 616 chickens and ducks have been culled to control the
outbreak. A batch of bird flu vaccines allocated by the Ministry of
Agriculture reached Baotou early Monday morning. All poultry in Jiuyuan
District will be inoculated in the next 10 days.
An investigation is being conducted to find where the farm owner bought
these chickens and ducks and where he sold the poultry.
China has reported 9 outbreaks of bird flu in poultry so far in 2006, in
northwestern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, north China's Shanxi
Province and Inner Mongolia, east China's Anhui Province, southwestern
Guizhou and Sichuan provinces and the central province of Hunan.
