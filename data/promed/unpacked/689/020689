An outbreak of hepatitis in the Colima Prison Colima kills 5 prisoners who allegedly exchanged syringes injecting heroin. In a statement, the authorities of health and safety in the state reported that there are 20 more who have this same disease. It was reported that the heroin was smuggled into prison by people who hid the drug in parts of the body.

The drug was mixed into the prison with potentially toxic products to dilute it and sell it at a lower price. "They acquire the narcotic inside prices of 5 and 10 pesos, they themselves told me, " said Hermilio Sabino Flores Arias, president of the State Commission Human Rights in Colima.

It is not excluded that the outbreak of hepatitis has also to do with the state and management of food into the prison. "My son showed me some lentils that were in bad condition and he developed severe pain and they thought he was drugged and put in the punishment cell," said the mother of an inmate.

[The posting does not state what kind of viral hepatitis is behind the outbreak or indeed whether this is viral hepatitis at all since toxic hepatitis could be at work here. Although more than the 25 cases may have occurred, since cases are often subclinical or at least anicteric (without jaundice) and can be missed but having a case-fatality rate of 20 percent (5 of the 25) would be quite unusual for acute viral hepatitis, for which the fatality rate is generally no more than 1 in 1000. An exception would be if the fatalities were related to superinfection with hepatitis D (delta hepatitis) in individuals who are already carriers of hepatitis B. - Mod.LL

More information on this outbreak would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.MPP
