8 hit by bug in swimming pool
-------------------------
A potentially deadly bacterium in a children's swimming pool has struck
down 8 victims, including a toddler, who is seriously ill in the hospital.
7 children and a mother have been infected with _E. coli_ O157 -- and
health officials fear more cases might follow -- after they were exposed to
bacteria at Stretford Leisure Centre.
3 children have been treated in the hospital, and one, who was admitted
more than a week ago, is still there. Health chiefs believe that at least
50 other swimmers could have been exposed to the bacterium in the
children's teaching pool. The outbreak happened when chlorine levels
dropped, at 8:30 am on Sun 5 Sep 2004, due to a blocked pump. The pump was
fixed by 2 pm. Health officials became aware of the outbreak when people
started reporting symptoms of _E. coli_ last week [4th week of September 2004].
The pool has been closed, and extensive tests have been made to try to find
the cause of the outbreak. The Health and Safety Executive has been called
in, and public health chiefs have also been carrying out checks on the
pool. Health chiefs and leisure center leadership are due to meet to decide
whether it is safe to be re-opened after it has been emptied, cleaned, and
refilled.
Bernhard Jones, chief executive of the not-for-profit Trafford Leisure
Trust, which runs the pool, said: "We are carrying out a number of tests to
establish what happened. The chlorine levels did drop below our recommended
standards, but they were still within national recommendations. We have
many procedures to keep the pools clean. They will be reviewed, but all the
indications are that this was the result of an accident. More often than
not, these kinds of infections are caused through fecal matter, but there
were no reports of any incidents of that sort on that day. The pool will
not be reopened until we are all satisfied that it is 100 percent safe."
Dr. Rosemary McCann, consultant at the Health Protection Agency in
Manchester, said: "As the incubation period for _E. coli_ O157 infection is
one to 9 days, it is highly unlikely that new cases will emerge now. But,
if there are people out there who developed symptoms of diarrheal illness,
after visiting the small pool on 5 Sep 2004, they should contact their
family doctors to arrange treatment."

[It still remains unclear whether the vehicle was the pool water or food at
the Leisure Center. Any new cases could occur representing secondary spread
as well a continuing reservoir for infection. - Mod.LL]
