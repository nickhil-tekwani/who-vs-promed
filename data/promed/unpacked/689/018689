Abstract
--------
Leprosy is a granulomatous infection caused by infection with _Mycobacterium leprae_ or _M. lepromatosis_. We evaluated skin biopsy and slit skin smear samples from 92 leprosy patients in Colombia by quantitative PCR. 5 (5.4%) patients tested positive for _M. lepromatosis_, providing evidence of the presence of this pathogen in Colombia.

----
The primary causal agent of leprosy is _M. leprae_; however, as of February 2022, _M. lepromatosis_ has been established as another etiologic agent that is still underexplored in many leprosy-endemic countries (1). Dual infections caused by both species have also been reported (2). The similarities between these bacteria initially led researchers to think _M. lepromatosis_ was a new strain of _M. leprae_; however, it is now considered a new species because of ≈9% difference in whole-genome sequences (3).

The global prevalence and extent of _M. lepromatosis_ infection are still unknown. Also unknown is whether _M. lepromatosis_ can cause substantially different disease severity from _M. leprae_ manifested as nerve damage, leprosy reactions (type I/II), relapse rate, and overall prognosis; these factors are essential to understanding the clinical implications and case management of patients with _M. lepromatosis_ infection or co-infection. We report the presence of _M. lepromatosis_ in patients in Colombia.

We performed _M. lepromatosis_- and _M. leprae_-specific real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) on 67 skin lesion biopsies and 25 earlobe slit skin smears (SSS) from 92 multibacillary leprosy patients identified during 2006-2016. The participants were from 11 provinces: Atlántico, Antioquia, Bolívar, Chocó, Cesar, Cundinamarca, Magdalena, Santander, Norte de Santander, Sucre, and Tolima. All samples belonged to the Colombian Institute of Tropical Medicine (Antioquia, Colombia) and were stored in 70% ethanol. Before sample collection, all participants gave written informed consent for future research, and the institutional ethics committee for human research at CES University endorsed such use. We processed samples at the National Hansen's Disease Program (NHDP) Laboratory (Baton Rouge, LA, USA). We conducted _M. lepromatosis_- and _M. leprae_-specific qPCR on these samples following DNA extraction with DNeasy Kit (QIAGEN, https://www.qiagen.com) and using previously described primers and probes (4,5). Both these qPCR tests are Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments validated and are now used as routine diagnostic tests at the NHDP (6).

Of the study participants, 87% were male. The median age was 51.5 years (range 12-84 years). 37% of the participants lived in Santander and 34.8% on Atlantic Coast (Appendix Table 1 [Appendix and tables available at the source URL above]). qPCRs amplified the repetitive element region specific to _M. lepromatosis_ in 5 patients and the repetitive element region specific to _M. leprae_ in all samples evaluated. Thus, 5.4% of the patient samples were positive for both _M. leprae_ and _M. lepromatosis_ and 94.6% (87 patients) were positive for _M. leprae_ only (Table). The 5 patients co-infected with _M. lepromatosis_ and _M. leprae_ resided in geographic areas with a high burden of leprosy: Santander, Atlántico, and Chocó. 4 had lepromatous leprosy (LL) and one had dimorphic LL; 1 of the patients had a history of type I leprosy reaction (Appendix Table 2).

Most leprosy-endemic countries do not conduct routine surveillance for _M. lepromatosis_, and so its true distribution and clinical effect are unknown as of 2022. However, this knowledge is crucial for clinical management and to understand the transmission network of leprosy-causing organisms. The earliest known population-based study to analyze the presence of both mycobacteria indicates that _M. lepromatosis_ arrived in America with human populations that migrated from Asia through the Bering Strait, in contrast to _M. leprae_, which arrived in America with the settlers and as a result of the slave trade (7). To clarify the clinical outcomes of _M. lepromatosis_ infection, a study in Mexico associated both mycobacteria with the forms already classified by Ridley and Jopling (8). That study found that of the 55 cases with _M. lepromatosis_ as the sole etiologic agent, 34 manifested LL, 13 developed diffuse LL, and the remaining 8 had other forms of leprosy. Fourteen patients carried both mycobacteria and showed all clinical forms (2). In contrast, 15% of leprosy patients in Brazil had _M. lepromatosis_ as the sole agent had polar tuberculoid leprosy, none had LL, and patients with infection by both mycobacteria had LL (7). The same study evaluated 8 patients in Myanmar and found _M. lepromatosis_ in 2 patients, both of whom had LL (7).

This study demonstrates presence of _M. lepromatosis_ in samples taken by our research group before 2008 when this mycobacterium was first reported (1). Therefore, we infer that _M. lepromatosis_ has coexisted with _M. leprae_ in Colombia for some time. Finally, this report confirms _M. lepromatosis_ in Colombia. Genomic surveillance is needed to monitor the infection dynamics of both mycobacteria among leprosy patients and contacts to stop transmission and limit the dire physical, social, economic, and emotional consequences that these organisms cause among susceptible persons.

[In 2008, an entirely new leprosy-causing species, named _Mycobacterium lepromatosis_, was identified in 2 patients from Mexico (in the liver of one patient and in the skin of another) who died of diffuse lepromatous leprosy (DLL) (ref 1 above).

In 2015, the _M. lepromatosis_ genome was described by researchers; its genome was comparable in size to that of _M. leprae_, with the protein-coding genes 93 percent identical in sequence between the 2 species (Singh P, Benjak A, Schuenemann VJ, et al. Insight into the evolution and origin of leprosy bacilli from the genome sequence of _Mycobacterium lepromatosis_. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2015; 112(14): 4459-64; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1421504112). The disease caused by _M. lepromatosis_, in the limited number of cases at the time, was diffuse lepromatous leprosy, a form of the disease long associated with leprosy cases in western Mexico and the Caribbean and was treatable by the same antibiotics used to treat _M. leprae_ (see ProMED posts Leprosy, new species - USA, Mexico, Singapore 20081126.3723 and Leprosy - Mexico: new species, whole genome sequencing, DLL 20150328.3261849).

Since 2008, _M. lepromatosis_ has been identified by PCR-based sequencing in several other countries, e.g., Singapore, Canada, Brazil, Malaysia, USA, and Myanmar. The Emerging Infectious Diseases report above adds Colombia to the list of countries.

Although _M. lepromatosis_ was initially associated with diffuse lepromatous leprosy, subsequent case reports and surveys have linked it to other forms of leprosy. In addition, several cases of mixed infection with _M. leprae_ and _M. lepromatosis_ have been reported. Similar to finding _M. leprae_ in armadillos, _M. lepromatosis_ has been found in Eurasian red squirrels in England and Scotland, suggesting the possibility of a zoonotic transmission (https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2021.698588/full). - Mod.ML
