Deep in the rainforest of south-east Cameroon, the voices of the men rang through the trees: "Where are the white people?" they shouted. The men, who begin to surround us, are poachers, who make their money from the illegal slaughter of gorillas and chimpanzees. They disperse but make it known that they are not keen for their activities to be reported; the trade they ply could not only wipe out critically endangered species but, scientists are now warning, could also create the next pandemic of a deadly virus in humans.

80 per cent of the meat eaten in Cameroon is killed in the wild and is known as "bushmeat." The nation's favoured dishes are gorilla, chimpanzee or monkey because of their succulent and tender flesh. According to one estimate, up to 3000 gorillas are slaughtered in southern Cameroon every year to supply an illicit but pervasive commercial demand for ape meat . Frankie, a poacher in the southern Dja Wildlife reserve who gave a fake name, said he is involved in the trade because he can earn good money from it, charging around GBP 60 [USD 94] per adult gorilla killed. "I have to make a living," he said. "Women come from the market and order a gorilla or a chimp, and I go and kill them."

Cameroon's south-eastern rainforests are also home to the Baka, traditional forest hunters who have the legal right to hunt wild animals, with the exception of great apes. Felix Biango, a Baka elder, said the group used to hunt gorilla every few weeks to feed his village, Ayene, but has stopped since Cameroon outlawed the practice 10 years ago. However, he says that every week, 3 or 4 people come from the cities to ask the group to help them to hunt wild animals, such as gorillas and chimpanzees.

While the Baka no longer hunt primates for themselves, Mr Biango says that they still kill gorillas for the commercial trade and will eat the meat if they find the animals already dead. Though Cameroonians have eaten primate meat for years, recent health scares have begun to raise fears about the safety of the meat. "In the village of Bakaklion, our brothers found a dead gorilla in the forest," Mr Biango said. "They took it back to the village and ate the meat. Almost immediately, everyone died, 25 men, women and children, the only person who didn't was a woman who didn't eat the meat."

Babila Tafon, head vet at the primate sanctuary Ape Action Africa (AAA), in Mefou, just outside the capital Yaounde, believes the incident that Biango describes could have been caused by an outbreak of Ebola, but cannot be sure because no tests were carried out. AAA now cares for 22 gorillas and more than 100 chimps, all orphans of the bushmeat trade. 3/4ths of all new human viruses are known to come from animals, and some scientists believe humans are particularly susceptible to those carried by apes. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is now widely believed to have originated in chimps. Apes are known to host other potentially deadly viruses, such as Ebola, anthrax, yellow fever and other potential viruses yet to be discovered.

Mr Tafon tests the blood of all apes arriving at the sanctuary. He says he has recently detected a new virus in the apes, simian foamy virus, which is closely related to HIV [See ProMED-mail archived reports listed below - Mod.CP]. "A recent survey confirmed this is now in humans, especially in some of those who are hunters and cutting up the apes in the south-east of the country," he said. Viruses are often transferred from ape to human through a bite, scratch or the blood of a dead ape getting into an open wound. There is a lower risk from eating cooked or smoked primates, but it is not completely safe.

Bushmeat is not only a concern for Cameroonians. Each year, an estimated 11 000 tons of bushmeat is illegally smuggled in to the UK, mainly from West Africa, and is known to include some ape meat. The transfer of viruses from ape to humans is a primary concern for the international virology research and referral base run by the Pasteur Centre in Yaounde. Each week, it screens more than 500 blood samples for all manner of viruses and alerts major international medical research centres if it finds an unfamiliar strain. Professor Dominique Baudon, the director of the Cameroon centre, says he is concerned that the bushmeat trade is a major gateway for animal viruses to enter humans worldwide, due to the export trade.

He says that the deeper poachers go in to the forest, and the more that primates are consumed, the more exposed people become to new unknown viruses and the more potential there is for the viruses to mutate into potentially aggressive forms. At the Ape Action Africa sanctuary, Rachel Hogan, who came to Cameroon from Birmingham 11 years ago, and her team focus on the last of Cameroon's great apes. Most of the gorillas and chimps Ms Hogan and her team look after are babies who have witnessed the murder of their parents. She says they are often suffering from terrible wounds and even trauma when they arrive at the sanctuary. "They grieve just like humans," she says. "We have had them where they will just sit rocking, grinding their teeth, and they don't respond to anything. You have to be able to win back their trust." The increasing number of rescued apes is putting pressure on the sanctuary. A group of 8 gorillas in the wild, protected by one dominant male, needs 16 square km to roam in to live comfortably. The sanctuary says there is nowhere in the vast tropical rainforest of Cameroon that the apes can safely be returned to the wild. "If this continues, there might not be any wild populations of gorillas left," says Ms Hogan.

[It is believed that AIDS, which has claimed over 30 million lives, may have evolved in the rainforest of west central Africa perhaps as a result of the bushmeat trade. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is thought to be derived from Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and to have evolved into a human pathogen, although there is no direct evidence suggesting how this occurred. So far, there has been little evidence of transfer of other known types of virus, but transmission of novel infectious agents is the real risk.

The Washington-based Bush Meat Crisis Task Force estimates that up to 5 million tons of wild animals are being "harvested" in the Congo Basin every year, the equivalent of 10 million cattle. The trade was initially driven by hunger -- it was a cheap source of food -- but has burgeoned with increased logging of the forests and growing demand. Now, it is international, extending the threat beyond the continent's boundaries. However, the size of the imports is unknown, but one 2010 study estimated that 5 tons of the meat per week were being smuggled in personal baggage via Roissy-Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, France. Gorilla and chimpanzee meat is said to be on offer to African communities in Hackney and Brixton at hundreds of pounds per kilogram.
