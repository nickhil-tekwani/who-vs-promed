Tilapia lake virus, Mexico
--------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 25 Aug 2018 from MVZ Joaquín Braulio Delgadillo Alvarez, [Director General of Animal Health, National Agro-Alimentary Health, Safety and Quality Service (SENASICA) Secretariat/Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries, and Food] Mexico, Mexico

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 4 Jul 2018
Date of confirmation of the event: 31 Jul 2018
Report date: 25 Aug 2018
Reason for notification: emerging disease
Morbidity: 1 (scale 0 to 5)
Mortality: 1 (scale 0 to 5)
Zoonotic impact: no
Causal agent: Tilapia lake virus (TiLV)

New outbreaks (20)
[The 20 outbreaks of TiLV occurred in the following states: Chiapas (5), Jalisco (1), Michoacán (1), Sinaloa (2), Tabasco (8), and Veracruz (3). See details of each outbreak at the source URL above. - Mod.CRD]

Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 20
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Tilapia (_Oreochromis niloticus_) / 7 181 077 / 244 065 / 243 900 / 0 / 0

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate / Apparent case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Tilapia (_Oreochromis niloticus_) / 3.40 / 3.40 / 99.93 / 3.40

*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: During the active surveillance carried out by the veterinary authorities together with the State Aquaculture Health Committees, tilapia lake virus was detected by molecular biology techniques in 20 aquaculture production units (APU) out of a national registry of 2,884 tilapia producers. The affected APU are located in some localities of six states of the country (Chiapas, Jalisco, Michoacán, Sinaloa, Tabasco and Veracruz). In order to protect national production, strategies were agreed with producers, technicians, researchers and industry representatives to raise biosafety levels, namely: good production, cleaning, washing and disinfecting practices of premises, equipment and means of transport and avoid movement, import and export of animals with suspected disease.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country, surveillance outside infected and/or protection zone, quarantine, vaccination prohibited, no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: emergency harvest, disinfection

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
SENASICA laboratory (biosafety level 3) (national laboratory) / Tilapia (_Oreochromis niloticus_) / real-time PCR / 31 Jul 2018 / Positive
SENASICA laboratory (biosafety level 3) (national laboratory) / Tilapia (_Oreochromis niloticus_) / virus sequencing / 2 Aug 2018 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

["Tilapines, comprising more than 100 species, are the 2nd most important group of farmed fish worldwide after carp. Global production is estimated at 4.5 million metric tons with a current value in excess of USD 7.5 billion. In some regions they are ecologically important (algae and mosquito control and habitat maintenance for shrimp farming) and an important wild capture species. Introduction of the virus has been shown to cause significant mortality (up to 90 percent) and thus result in serious economic losses to both farmers and fishers.

"TiLV has been reported in Colombia, Ecuador, and Israel, and most recently, Egypt, Thailand, India, Malaysia, and the Philippines. However, a lack of thorough investigation of all mortality incidents means that the geographic distribution of TiLV may be wider than currently. For example, reports of mortality in tilapia in Ghana and Zambia in 2016 have not been attributed to TiLV but the available information does not indicate that the presence of the virus has been investigated. A partial genome from Thailand showed relatively high variation to strains from Israel (around 97 percent nucleotide identity)."
