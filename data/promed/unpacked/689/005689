On 5 Jun 2020, the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) published the details of a recent multistate outbreak of mumps in its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) [see reference below].

The outbreak involved 62 cases linked to a single asymptomatic wedding attendee. Even though mumps is a vaccine-preventable disease, 41 of the individuals infected in the reported incident had been fully vaccinated according to the current guidelines. What started as a mild illness in a caretaker of children in Nebraska grew into an epidemic involving communities in six different states. This raises concerns about waning immunity from childhood mumps immunization.

Mumps is a highly contagious disease of children and young adults. It is caused by a paramyxovirus of which there is only a single serotype. Humans are the only known host, and infections are spread by direct contact or through droplets from the upper respiratory tract.

The infection may remain asymptomatic for an incubation period that ranges from 12-25 days. When symptoms are apparent, mumps can present with initial flulike symptoms, such as fever, congestion and aches, followed by a characteristic painful swelling of the jaw. The index case of the outbreak developed left ear and jaw tenderness the day after attending the wedding. Her jaw swelling was noted 11 days after her initial exposure to the virus.

In most cases, the disease resolves spontaneously within 2 weeks of onset. However, complications such as deafness, infertility or encephalitis may result. Thankfully, the disease can be largely prevented by vaccination.

The history of mumps dates to the 5th century BC, when Hippocrates described the condition as a bilateral or unilateral swelling near the ears, and noted that some patients had bilateral or unilateral pain and swelling of the testicles. Isolation and culture of the virus did not occur until 1945, however, and a vaccination against it was first licensed in 1967.

Without routine immunization, the incidence of mumps would be projected to be 100-1000 cases per million, with an epidemic occurring every 4-5 years. Universal vaccination has been a crucial factor in the global decline in the incidence of mumps. Finland was the 1st country to declare itself mumps-free, in 2000, after a national 2-dose vaccination program for children, resulting in high vaccination coverage. In Korea, the mumps vaccine was included in a national immunization program in 1985, and booster doses began in 1997.

Sadly, according to the World Health Organization, the mumps vaccine had been introduced nationwide in only 122 countries by the end of 2018. As of June 2020, Japan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and most countries in southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa did not have the mumps vaccine included in their national immunization programs.

In the United States, the CDC recommendation for childhood immunization against mumps is a 2-dose series. The 1st shot is given at 12-15 months of age; the 2nd at 4-6 years. A catch-up vaccination may be done for unimmunized children and adolescents, with 2 doses given at least 4 weeks apart. This is especially recommended for at-risk groups such as post-high school students, health care personnel and international travelers. The mumps vaccine is given along with vaccines against measles and rubella, a combination known as MMR. It confers a 78 percent risk reduction following one dose rising to 88 percent after receiving 2 doses.

[[The finding that the contacts were fully vaccinated is concerning. Re-infection due to waning immunity has been a particular problem for young adults immunized against mumps.

Discussion [edited]
A mumps outbreak involving 6 states occurred following exposure to an asymptomatic, fully vaccinated (1) index patient who reported extensive social interaction during the peak period of infectivity, in an environment where potentially susceptible persons were densely clustered. Mumps immunity after childhood vaccination can wane by early adulthood (6). It is likely that waning of vaccine-induced immunity contributed to this outbreak, because approximately 2/3 of patients had received 2 or more doses of MMR vaccine, and the median patient age was 35 years. Specific viral factors (such as mutations increasing pathogenicity and shedding) were not a likely contributor because mumps genotype G is commonly implicated in both sporadic cases and outbreaks in the United States (7). However, mumps is most infectious just before and during onset of parotitis (3), and the timing of the event likely contributed to transmission among exposed attendees because the index patient developed parotitis the day after the wedding. The wedding served as a setting conducive to droplet transmission, facilitated by close social contact.

Isolation of ill persons and a communitywide MMR vaccination campaign helped end the outbreak. As of 1 Dec 2019, no additional cases had been identified in community A, nor had any additional cases been identified in any other state as linked to this outbreak. A decline in case count before the campaign was observed, which complicated assessment of the campaign's relative contribution in controlling the outbreak. Collaborative efforts, including early and regular communication between local, state, and national public health authorities, local health care providers, and community officials proved crucial for efficient resource mobilization, strengthened preparedness, and resulted in effective disease containment.

"Significance
The live-attenuated mumps-measles-rubella (MMR) vaccine has been highly successful in the United States since its introduction 47 years ago. However, for the past decade, mumps outbreaks have been occurring among young adults who were vaccinated as children. Waning immunity has been proposed as a key contributing factor to mumps resurgence. In our sample (n = 71) of 18- to 23-year-old college students, the majority had detectable mumps IgG antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) but the magnitude was lower than rubella. Neutralizing antibody titers were 6-fold lower to a circulating genotype G mumps strain versus the vaccine strain. 10 percent of our participants had no detectable memory B cells to mumps. Strategies are needed to improve immunity to the mumps vaccine."
