Unidentified illness kills 4 Toronto seniors
--------------------------------------------
Public health officials are investigating the deaths of 4 people from
a "typical respiratory illness" at an east-end senior's residence, but say the
outbreak is not SARS.

The 4 victims were residents at the Seven Oaks Home for the Aged in the city's
east end, said Dr. Barbara Yaffe, Toronto Public Health's director of
communicable disease control.

"We know from the testing that's been done so far that this is not influenza;
we know this is not SARS; we know this is not avian influenza," said Dr.
Allison McGeer, infectious disease consultant at Toronto's Mount Sinai
Hospital.

"There are many other viruses it could be ... and the Ontario Public Health
lab is working very hard on identifying which one of those viruses it might
be."

The unidentified illness has affected 68 residents and 5 employees at
the facility. 3 of the victims died at the home while the 4th died in
the hospital, she said. Dr. Yaffe said all of the 4 victims had
severe pre-existing medical conditions. 2 were in their 90s, another
in the late 70s, and the 4th in the 50s.

She said outbreaks are typical, but this one set off alarms because of its
severity. "We get hundreds of outbreaks every year, however in this situation
we do have a particularly serious outbreak," Dr. Yaffe said.

She said 15 people have been admitted to hospitals in the area, but
are not being quarantined. "There is no quarantine necessary for
this," Dr. Yaffe said, and emphasized that there was no threat to the
greater public.

The speed with which the illness spread led Dr. McGeer to speculate
whether a presence of bacteria within the home contributed to the
outbreak.

Dr. Yaffe also added that while this outbreak was serious, it was not
the worst in recent memory. Last year [2004], 11 people died after an
outbreak at a Cobourg, Ontario nursing home, she said.

CFTO News reported that the 1st signs of the most recent illness were
detected Tuesday [27 Sep 2005], but no residents were taken to the
hospital until Saturday night [1 Oct 2005]. Dozens of family members
were prevented from entering the home Saturday.

Emergency room staff at Centenary Hospital donned gowns and masks
Saturday [1 Oct 2005] as a procedural precaution, a standard practice
in Ontario hospitals after the SARS outbreak in 2003.

"Either people haven't been following precautions that we are
supposed to follow now for all people with fever or respiratory
illness ... or alternatively, somebody had brought it in from the
community to the nursing home, and they weren't really that sick from
it," infectious disease specialist Dr. Neil Rau told CTV News.

Symptoms of the illness include fever, cough, runny nose, and
malaise, Dr. McGeer said.

She said the best way for the public to prevent such outbreaks from
occurring is to wash their hands thoroughly and frequently.

[ProMED-mail contacted Dr. Allison McGeer about this outbreak and
received the following information:]


We have a significantly larger than usual outbreak (71 of 249
residents, and 6 of 290 staff, plus 2 visitors) in a long term care
facility for the elderly that is relatively severe (4 deaths in
residents, and one older staff member in the hospital with
pneumonia).

[The epidemic] is rapidly progressive; ([the] 1st case
[had onset on] 25 Sep [2005], what appears to be peak [in the
epidemic] with more than 20 cases on 29 [Sep 2005], and only 7 cases
with onset on 1 Oct [2005]). In addition, a few residents who
initially appeared to have minor illness then deteriorated rapidly.

All laboratory tests have been negative to date (EIA [enzyme immunoassay], DFA
[direct fluorescent antibody] and PCR [polymerase chain reaction] for
respiratory viruses all negative, including influenza A H3N2, A H1N1, A H5N1,
influenza B, RSV [respiratory syncytial virus], Adenovirus, parainfluenza
viruses 1-4, SARSCoV [SARS coronavirus]; several urines were negative for
legionella, [there were] no positive bacterial cultures of blood or sputum).

So it is certainly different than usual, but it does not appear to be out of
range for a respiratory viral outbreak in a large long term care facility. A
number of other smaller outbreaks have been recently reported in long term
care facilities across the province, as is typical for this time of year; no
positive viral tests have yet been obtained, suggesting the circulation of a
virus that is relatively difficult to culture.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. Allison McGeer for sending us
more information on this outbreak. One can speculate on the variety
of respiratory viruses that may be responsible for this outbreak,
most of which have already been ruled out according to the testing
profiles presented above. One wonders whether there might be
involvement of the human metapneumovirus or another member of the
coronavirus family (other than the SARS CoV) that might be
circulating and not as yet part of the routine test panels.
More information as it becomes available would be appreciated.

Information from other geographical areas that might be experiencing
similar patterns would also be appreciated, as it might help "point a
finger" at the etiology of this outbreak. - Mod.MPP]
