Two more cases of African swine fever (ASF) have been confirmed in wild boars in the eastern German state of Brandenburg, with one found outside the area of the 1st discoveries, the federal agriculture ministry said on Wednesday [30 Sep 2020].

One new discovery was confirmed in the Maerkisch-Oderland district in Brandenburg outside of the area close to the Polish border where the 1st cases were found, the ministry said. The 2nd case was inside the original area, it added.

"The state of Brandenburg must now undertake an appropriate adaptation of the existing protection zones and protection measures to prevent a further expansion of the disease," the ministry said. The new discoveries bring total confirmed cases to 38 since the 1st reported on 10 Sep 2020. All were in wild animals with no farm pigs affected, the ministry said.

The Friedrich-Loeffler scientific institute confirmed the latest animals had ASF, the ministry said. More cases in wild boar have to be expected as the disease is highly infectious, it said.

The German government is considering aid to farmers after prices fell following the discovery of ASF in wild animals in the country, Germany's agriculture minister Julia Kloeckner said on Friday [25 Sep 2020].

On 10 Sep 2020, German officials confirmed the 1st case of ASF in a wild boar found near the Polish border. ASF is not dangerous to humans but fatal to pigs, and the mortality rate of the virus is extremely high. Some countries banned imports of German pork in September [2020] to slow down the spread of the virus after the 1st case was confirmed.

[Following the initial detection of ASF in Germany's wild boar population, a restriction zone -- consisting of a core area, an endangered area and a buffer zone -- was declared. The boundaries and the specific restrictions/measures applied in each are presented in the official announcement with map at https://msgiv.brandenburg.de/msgiv/de/themen/verbraucherschutz/veterinaerwesen/tierseuchen/afrikanische-schweinepest/.

According to the announcement, finding dead wild boars within the restriction zone is supported now with the following allowances:
1. In the core area -- EUR 150 (USD 176)/piece;
2. In the endangered area -- EUR 100 (USD 117)/piece;
3. In the buffer zone -- EUR 100 (USD 117)/piece.

The Maerkisch-Oderland district is situated outside (northern) to the initial core area; see map at https://tinyurl.com/y7kepqby.

Thanks are due to Sabine Zentis for bringing the new cases to our attention and informing that the state of Brandenburg will fund part of a hard fence along the Polish border for EUR 6 million (USD 7.03 million). The fence should be finished by the end of November 2020. - Mod.AS
