Disease decimates Kansas buffalo
---------------------------------------
Nearly 1/4th of the buffalo have died at the state-owned Maxwell
Wildlife Refuge, home to one of the oldest surviving wild buffalo
herds.

A new disease is decimating buffalo herds across the state and has
prompted the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks to cancel its
annual buffalo auction, typically held in mid-November.

The animals are infected with _Mycoplasma bovis_, a bacterium that
causes pneumonia, mastitis and arthritis in cattle. It was 1st
detected in some U.S. cattle in the 1960s. For buffalo, it is
especially virulent.

"They don't have any prior exposure or resistance," said Cliff
Peterson, manager of the Maxwell refuge. "For buffalo, it's pretty
lethal."

Maxwell Wildlife Refuge, in northwest McPherson County, is home to
the state's largest buffalo herd, which until a few weeks ago had 200
animals. Since the disease struck, 47 have died and another 3 may
have the disease.

"Any herd of buffalo that comes in contact with it is going to get
knocked down," Peterson said. "People are going to lose animals."

Peterson said he was aware of 2 other infected buffalo herds in
Kansas. Half of one herd and 1/3rd of the other have died.

"We'd never seen it before," said Randy Clark, regional public land
supervisor for Kansas Wildlife and Parks.

Maxwell has been home to the buffalo since 1951 and has conducted its
annual buffalo sale for nearly 30 years. Normally scheduled for 15
November, the sale was canceled this year [2006] to prevent the
disease from spreading to other herds.

The refuge tries to maintain its herd at about 200 head by selling
off select calves, cows and young bulls each year. The animals
typically sell for USD 1000 to USD 3000 apiece.

More than 25 million buffalo roamed the prairies in the United States
2 centuries ago. By the 1890s, their ranks had been reduced to less
than a thousand. Until about 40 years ago, buffalo were near
extinction, and the 2800-acre refuge was one of the few places in the
nation to help nurture the species.

Maxwell, about 50 miles north of Wichita, draws about 40 000 visitors
a year who view the herd from their cars or on tram tours offered by
a volunteer group. The refuge also is home to a herd of 50 elk, which
doesn't appear to be affected by the disease.

It's not clear how the buffalo became infected. Kansas State
University veterinarian Larry Hollis said _Mycoplasma bovis_
infections are rare in native Kansas cattle herds. He said the best
advice for cattlemen is to make sure they have a double fence between
buffalo herds and cattle herds to prevent nose-to-nose contact. "The
bacteria is spread by sneeze droplets or nose-to-nose contact," he
said.

For now, Kansas Wildlife and Parks officials are putting the diseased
buffalo in quarantine. "It doesn't matter how we got the disease,
we've just got to deal with it," Clark said.

Clark said the buffalo at Maxwell have been vaccinated for
_Mycoplasma bovis_ twice in the past month and will continue to be
vaccinated on a yearly basis. It's unclear how effective the vaccine
is in buffalo.

[Many diseases that are more common in cattle may be more virulent in
some of the wild animal species. Unfortunately, most vaccines are not
tested in the exotic or wildlife species.

Mycoplasma is a persistent organism that is difficult to eliminate,
and there are approximately 20 species.

_Mycoplasma_ spp causes 2 types of pneumonia, contagious bovine
pleuropneumonia and enzootic pneumonia of calves. Contagious bovine
pleuropneumonia is caused by _Mycoplasma mycoides_ subsp. _mycoides_
and is considered a foreign animal disease, (FAD).

Generally, _Mycoplasma_ is seldom cultured as a pure culture but
rather in combination with other bacteria or viruses.

A buffalo in America is more correctly known as an American Bison,
_Bison bison_.
