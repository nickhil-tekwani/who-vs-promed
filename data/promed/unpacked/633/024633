In the course of laboratory research of a shipment of food potato
(9.14 tonnes) supplied from China to the wholesale market in Irkutsk
through Zabaikalsk Settlement in the Chita Region, the Irkutsk
Department of FGU "VNIIKR" [All-Russian Plant Quarantine Center]
detected the quarantine disease agent -- bacterial brown potato rot.

This disease poses a threat to the country's economy. In case of
contamination the crop losses may come up to 80 per cent.

In the course of phytosanitary inspection of one more shipment of
food potato (21.4 tonnes) supplied from China to Irkutsk through the
Chita Region, experts also revealed contamination with bacterial
brown rot (laboratory certificate no. 2049 18 Jul 2008). According to
the information of the Regional Office of Rosselkhoznadzor for the
Irkutsk Region and Ust-Ordynski Buryat Autonomous District, the
contaminated potato has been used for food purposes.

[Brown rot (also called bacterial wilt) of potato is caused by
_Ralstonia solanacearum_ race 3 and is widely distributed in warm
temperate areas. Symptoms include wilting of plants as well as
internal staining and rotting of tubers, and death of plants. The
bacteria may also latently infect the host without causing symptoms
and can survive in potato tubers during storage posing a high risk
for introduction of the pathogen to new areas. Tomato and other
solanaceous crops are also susceptible. The pathogen is spread by
mechanical means (including insects), contaminated equipment,
infected plant material (including seed potatoes), soil, and water.
Some weeds and unharvested potato plants may serve as pathogen
reservoirs. Disease management is difficult relying mostly on
exclusion from new areas. Some cultural methods and limited genetic
resistance may be used.

_R. solanacearum_ has been classified into various races and biovars
affecting more than 200 plant species including major crops including
banana and peanut. Races 2 and 3 have been placed on the quarantine
lists of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO).
