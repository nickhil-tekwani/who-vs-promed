----------------------------------------------------------------------
It's ordinary old psittacine circovirus (beak and feather disease)
[PBFD/PCD], just described very strangely. I have never heard PBFD/PCD
described as a stomach virus either.

[Indeed, it is psittacine circoviral disease (PCD) otherwise known as
beak and feather disease. It has in some circles been called parrot
AIDS, which is another misnomer. We appreciate the response on this.
Hopefully whoever called it a stomach virus will recant. - Mod.TG]

The professor referred to in the article is surely Shane Raidal,
international authority on psittacine beak and feather disease virus
-- an avian circovirus. This virus is not a stomach virus, as far as I
am aware, though it is associated with immune suppression, along with
beak and feather deformities, as the name would suggest.

The moderator's comments were based on the notion that the virus was a
"stomach" virus, and so naturally, avian bornavirus sprang to mind. I
wonder if the journalist reporting this piece heard someone say
"circovirus," and misreported it as "stomach virus."

[I suspect that Dr Bennett is correct in his interpretation of what
the journalist heard and misinterpreted. I appreciate him clearing up
the confusion. - Mod.TG]
