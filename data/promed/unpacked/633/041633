Presence of banana xanthomonas wilt (_Xanthomonas campestris_ pv.
_musacearum_) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)

for Crozier) Accepted for publication 4 Jun 2005.
In May 2004, following reports from local farmers of a devastating new
banana disease, the first 3 authors visited Masisi District, 72 km
northwest from Goma in North Kivu Province (altitude 1700 m above sea
level) and diagnosed banana bacterial wilt caused by _Xanthomonas
campestris_ pv. _musacearum_ (Xcm).
Symptoms were similar to those in Uganda (Tushemereirwe et al., 2003) and
included: progressive yellowing, wilting and blackening of leaves; yellow
or brown vascular streaks throughout the plant; pockets of pale yellow
bacterial ooze in airspaces within leaf bases); premature ripening and
internal discoloration of fruits; and shriveling of male inflorescence
buds. Inflorescence symptoms probably result from transmission of bacteria
by insects and were uncommon. This may explain the limited spread in DRC of
only about 10 km from the original focus at Bashali Mokoto village since
2001, compared with more than 400 km in Uganda over the same time period;
see <http://www.banana.go.ug>. As in Uganda, ABB banana genotypes
(especially Pisang Awak) seem to be the 1st, and matooke clones (Musa
AAA-EA group) the last, to be infected. Affected stools do not always die;
new suckers emerge, and these initially appear healthy but usually become
infected from the mother plant, rarely surviving to flowering stage. The
epicenter of the outbreak in Masisi was devastated, with total loss of
yield and an alarming impact on food security.
Using methods described by Tushemereirwe et al. (2004), yellow pigmented
bacteria were isolated as almost pure cultures from samples of diseased
inflorescence stalks sent to the Global Plant Clinic at CABI Bioscience.
Biochemical and molecular characteristics of 2 isolates were
indistinguishable from Xcm from Uganda. Both caused rapid wilting within
7-10 days of inoculation into young banana plants, from which the same
organism was re-isolated.
It may be feasible to eradicate this outbreak by destroying affected plants
and cleaning up affected fields, combined with removing male flower buds in
surrounding healthy plants to prevent insect transmission. However, the 1st
author has recently observed a new disease focus about 20 km from the 1st
one, so continued vigilance and control action will be needed. The origin
of these outbreaks is unknown. Until 2001, Xcm was known only from
Ethiopia, where it causes disease in enset (_Ensete ventricosum_) and
cultivated banana (Yirgou & Bradbury, 1968, 1974). It is possible that the
disease has spread from wild or semi-cultivated enset plants, which can be
found throughout the Masisi region.

[Banana (_Musa sp._) is the 4th most important global food crop after rice,
wheat and maize in terms of gross value of production. Total world _Musa_
production is currently about 97 million tones annually (FAOSTAT, 2003), of
which bananas cultivated for export account for only 10 percent. Hence,
they are important for food security in the humid tropics and provide
income to farmers. It is a major staple food, supplying up to 25 percent of
the carbohydrates for approximately 70 million people in Africa's humid
forest and mid-altitude regions. The East and Central Africa sub-region
alone produces nearly 20 million tons of bananas annually.
Major banana-producing countries such as Uganda, with 10 million tons
annually, Rwanda, with 1.5 million and the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC), with one million, are experiencing sharp losses due to attacks by
Xcm, which causes banana bacterial wilt [BBW] (see Spore 106). At Goma, in
the DRC's eastern province of Nord-Kivu, the price of wine bananas and
cooking bananas has doubled, resulting from losses of 60 percent.
"Production in Kichanga and Rutshuru has fallen by around 60 percent, and
we have been forced to turn to producers in the area of Bweremana, 50 km
from Goma. Even with that, we are not managing to satisfy the increasingly
important Rwandan and Ugandan demands," said Masumbuko Butaka, president of
the Association des producteurs et vendeurs de bananes de Bweremana
(APROVEB), which represents Bweremana banana producers and vendors.
Infected trees have to be burned. For him and his neighbors, it is a matter
of preventing the disease spreading from plant-to-plant. According to
Augustin Milambo, an agronomist with the Food and Agricultural Organization
of the United Nations (FAO) in Goma, farmers are not always prepared to
make such a sacrifice. Reluctance to uproot their banana plants makes the
battle against this scourge difficult." According to initial estimates,
only 8 of 2500 hectares of the region's plantations already infected have
had their plants uprooted.
It is difficult to eradicate BBW once it has become established in
smallholder production systems, and outbreaks must be managed effectively
and quickly to prevent the spread of the disease. Removal of the male bud,
to reduce insect transmission of the disease, and strict discipline by
farmers to avoid transmission on contaminated tools and crop residues can
help halt the advance of BBW. There are no known resistant cultivars.
Strict application of phytosanitary practices are required.
