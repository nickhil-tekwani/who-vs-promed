Listeriosis is a relatively uncommon infectious disease in eastern part of
Quebec Province.
We had reported our clinical experiences with 12 patients in the Eastern
Townships, Quebec, Canada over a 19-year period (1976 to 1995). Can J
Infect Dis 1997;8(1):29-32.
In our experience, listeriosis is predominantly a disease of elderly and
immunosuppressed patients. This retrospective study is summarized at the
following web site:
http://www.pulsus.com/INFDIS/08_01/mazi_ed.htm
Noyan, is a small municipality on the western shore of the Richelieu river,
a 70 km drive from Montreal and about 130 km west of Sherbrooke, Queen city
of the Eastern Townships.
I might add that a group of 8 persons, including the author of this
message, enjoyed the surface ripened soft cheese commonly know as Empereur
or Reblochon bought on November 11, 1998 at La fromagerie Fritz Kaiser Inc.
of Noyan for a dinner party on the nite of the ANIMALNET & CFIA Press
Release, 13 Nov 1998 calling back that product sold between October 26 and
31, 1998.
We all learned about this product recall from the local newspapers the next
morning on November 14, 1998!
Fortunately, nobody from our group developed any symptoms and we are all
looking forward to our coming gathering next weekend...but without any
fancy cheeses this time!
