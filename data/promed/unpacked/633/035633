2 weeks after eradication, polio resurfaces
-------------------------------------------
Barely 2 weeks after World Health Organisation (WHO) declared India as a polio-free nation, an 18-month-old female child was admitted to a state-run hospital in Kolkata with suspected polio on Monday [12 Mar 2012].

The child, [is] a resident of Indrabala village near Baruipur in South 24 Parganas district, was admitted with symptoms of paralysis with disability in movement and fever.

The child's stool samples have been sent to the National Institute of Virology in Pune and School of Tropical Medicine in Kolkata for confirmatory tests. The reports are expected next week.

"It is a suspected case of polio. In medical parlance, the symptoms are called acute flaccid paralysis. The patient is under observation," Kumar Kanti Das, superintendent of Baruipur subdivisional hospital (BSH), said.

The child's mother, said [she] began dragging her feet after she was administered routine immunisation (not for polio) at a primary health centre in February [2012]. "Several other babies in our locality are suffering from these symptoms," [the child's mother] said.

Authorities have now decided to decided to launch an intensive surveillance programme in Indrabala village, said Dr Amabasu Das, additional director of health services in charge of mother and child care.

The last polio case in the country was detected in January last year [2011] when a 2-year-old girl from Howrah district was afflicted with the virus. There were no reports of other polio cases in the country in the following 12 months, and India was declared polio-free.

"We have checked with the district administration. WHO officials have also rushed to the hospital. The child was administered oral polio vaccines more than once," Sanjay Mitra, principal secretary in charge of health department, said.

If [this child] is indeed afflicted with polio, it will raise questions about the efficacy of the pulse polio drives that the administration organises with fanfare.

[One hopes that the case of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) mentioned above is found to be a non-poliovirus associated AFP. On 13 Jan 2012, India celebrated the one year anniversary since the date of onset of the last confirmed case of wild poliovirus associated paralytic disease, at which time India was removed from the list of polio endemic countries.

The statement from the child's mother in the newswire that "several other babies in our locality are suffering from these symptoms," is rather disconcerting. Of note, the last confirmed case of WPV associated disease in India was in Howrah district of West Bengal. The suspected case mentioned in the newswire above lives in South 24 Parganas district which borders with Howrah district (for a map of West Bengal showing districts, see http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/westbengal/westbengal-district.htm). More information on the results of laboratory tests and additional investigations into the statement about other possible AFP cases in the same village would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.MPP]

Nigeria: country records 4 polio cases in 10 weeks
----------------
Dr Zikrullah Giwa, the Polio Technical Consultant to the Northern Governors' Forum (NGF), said Thursday [8 Mar 2012] that Nigeria recorded 4 cases of wild poliovirus [WPV] in the past 10 weeks.

Giwa who made this known at a meeting of the forum in Kaduna, said the cases were recorded in Kaduna, Sokoto, Borno, and Zamfara states.

"In 2012, Nigeria has 4 cases of wild polio virus in 4 states compared to 4 cases in 3 states for the same period in 2011."

According to him, the current National Epidemiology [sic], the country recorded 62 cases of the wild poliovirus in 2011 in 8 states.

Giwa stated that the total number of "circulating vaccine derived poliovirus" (cVDPV2) was 35 in 10 states of the federation in 2011.

"In 2012, Nigeria has zero cVDPV2 compared to 5 cases in 4 states for the same period [of 2011]."

The consultant identified weak political will, funding, monitoring, and commitment as some of the obstacles against the polio eradication.

He told the governors that only 10 months were left for the country to achieve the global goal of stopping polio transmission.

He advised them to emulate the India strategy of interrupting the spread of the disease, adding that advocacy for sustained support and political commitment at all levels of governance were necessary for eradication.

The consultant also urged traditional institutions, religious, and professional bodies and the civil society to support the crusade to free the country of polio.

[The reports of 4 cases distributed geographically in 4 states suggests continued geographically widespread transmission of WPV in northern Nigeria.

Over the past 4 months, the lowest number of cases globally has been recorded during this rolling time period for the last 10 years. While this is encouraging news and demonstrates the impact of eradication activities, endemic transmission of polio in Nigeria, Pakistan, and Afghanistan continues to pose a significant risk to children everywhere. Over the past 6 months, 247 cases have been reported worldwide, the bulk of these cases are from the 3 remaining endemic countries (Nigeria with 45 cases, Pakistan with 122 cases, and Afghanistan with 56 cases).

[A map showing the location of confirmed WPV associated polio in 2012 can be found at http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring.aspx.

At one of the opening plenary sessions of the International Conference on Emerging Infectious Diseases (ICEID 2012) yesterday (11 Mar 2011), there was mention that due to funding shortfalls, 15 planned polio vaccination campaigns scheduled for this year (2012) will be cancelled. Given the continued evidence of circulation of WPV in the 3 remaining polio endemic countries (Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Nigeria), the risk of importation of WPV from these countries into countries that have previously interrupted WPV transmission is ever present if vaccination rates in these countries cannot be sustained and pockets of susceptibles are present -- a worrisome situation. - Mod.MPP]
