Case of rabies in Chile
-----------------------
A case of rabies virus infection was recently confirmed in the commune of Quilpue, Valparaiso as a consequence of a dog bite. The victim, whose condition is life-threatening, was attacked by a pack of stray dogs and bitten by 2 of them, which would have transmitted the rabies virus infection. The health authority, in addition to officially confirming the event, has ordered the vaccination of all dogs and cats within a 500 meter [547 yard] radius of the incident. It has not been possible to examine the attacking dogs because only one of them has been found.

Confirmation of rabies infection in this incident will result in the loss of Chile's canine rabies-free status, recognised by WHO in 2010. The last case of rabies in humans by virus of canine origin was in 1972. The last human case of infection by bat rabies dates back to 1996. The most recent cases of rabies in domestic animals were in 2007, a dog and a cat in the city of Curico, with exposure to bats. Over the years there have been only sporadically verified of cases of rabies in bats, maintained what is known as the sylvatic cycle of the disease.

In the face of this situation, a group of animal health and zoonoses specialists at the University of Chile and related institutions have issued the following statement:

- We regret the present situation and wish to express our sympathy to the victim's family.

- What has happened is a reversal of decades of efforts in the country -- governmental, municipal, scientific, and especially medical veterinarians and pet protection NGOs, which helped eradicate the disease from this country.

- The recent case of human rabies involving a bite by a stray dog is mainly due to a lack of control of this animal population in the country. Also, Chile has not eradicated rabies from the insectivorous bat population so there is a burden of rabies virus in bat populations, "available" to infect other susceptible mammals, such as dogs, cats, or people.

- The extent and behaviour of the stray dog population had enhanced the likelihood of exposure to rabies virus present in bats. This risk is enhanced wherever animals [dogs] have not been vaccinated.

- The probability that a rabid dog might transmit rabies to human victims is enhanced under the current situation of increased reports of dog bites. Stray and abandoned dogs have high mobility especially in the search for food, increasing the likelihood of contact with people. In addition, these dogs, when they acquire pack behaviour, are highly aggressive, increasing the likelihood of attacks on people and animals.

- What happened in Quilpue was absolutely predictable. Most worrisome is that these risk conditions have increased practically in the whole country. Currently it is estimated that more than a million dogs (or even 4 million by some estimates) are distributed in all the communes of Chile, in the cities, countryside, and national parks.

- Information about the current situation has been distributed widely but more dissemination of information to the public about the disease, its transmission, prevention, and management is needed. The measures taken appear to have been insufficient and efforts should be focused now on increasing immunisation coverage of pets (dogs and cats), and especially of stray animals, which should also be removed from public areas.

- It should be a priority to prohibit dogs from public places except in the control of a responsible owner. We recognise that the cause of the problem is the irresponsibly of people who abandon dogs, This is a situation that requires an immediate response.

[In summary: a person in Quilpue has contracted rabies as consequence of being bitten by a stray dog. The condition of the victim is described as life-threatening, but it is not stated if the victim was offered and received post-exposure vaccination.

Chile's status as a rabies-free area, with virus restricted to the insectivorous bat population, is no longer tenable. It is likely that the Chilean authorities will now take action to deal with a developing stray dog problem and consider tighter control and vaccination of domestic pets.

Quilpue is a city and capital of the Marga Marga Province in central Chile's Valparaiso Region. It is part of the Greater Valparaiso metropolitan area and widely known as "City of the Sun" (Ciudad del Sol). - Mod.CP]
