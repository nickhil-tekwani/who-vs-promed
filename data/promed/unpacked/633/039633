Officials: No End to Greening - Difficulties in detecting, tracking
fatal citrus disease prevent its eradication.
-----------------------------------------------
Just 2 months after finding the 1st case of citrus greening
[Huanglongbing (HLB)] in Florida, state and federal agriculture
officials said growers will have to live with the fatal disease,
because it cannot be eradicated.

"There was a consensus of the scientists that the estimated length of
time of the disease's presence in Florida, difficulty of detecting
infected trees in a timely manner, movement by a small innumerable
insect vector and limitations of diagnostic tools precluded making
eradication of the disease feasible," according to a statement
released Monday [31 Oct 2005] by the Florida Department of
Agriculture and Consumer Services.

That consensus was reached in an 20 Oct 2005 teleconference among
leading state and federal scientists and officials with the U.S. and
state agriculture departments, the statement said.

Greening is caused by bacteria that can live in a variety of hosts,
including citrus trees and ornamental plants. Common symptoms include
leaf mottling, which also take on a yellowish green color. HLB always
kills a citrus tree eventually, but before that, it retards fruit
growth and gives the juice a salty, bitter taste. It's called
"greening" because the bottom of the fruit remains green.

A state official discovered the 1st case of HLB near Homestead at the
end of August 2005. Scientists think the bacteria came to Florida
through infected plant material imported from areas where the disease
is prevalent, including Asia, Africa and Brazil. Once established,
however, the most common means of spread is by the citrus psyllid, an
insect that also serves as a host for the bacteria.

HLB is difficult to detect because symptoms resemble other common
nutritional citrus diseases and because the bacteria can live in
infected trees for 3 years or more before symptoms arise.

As of Friday [29 Oct 2005], state officials have confirmed 404
greening outbreaks in 268 locations across 8 counties, said Denise
Feiber, a spokeswoman for the state agriculture department. Those
counties are Miami-Dade, Monroe, Broward, Martin, Palm Beach, St.
Lucie, Hendry and Sarasota.

There have been no reports of HLB in Polk County, which leads the
state's citrus-producing counties with 95 505 acres of commercial
citrus groves as of 2004 and ranked 2nd in citrus production in the
2004-2005 season, with 24.8 million boxes harvested.

The spread of HLB in Florida follows patterns in other parts of the
world, the statement said.

According to Feiber, the long length of time for HLB symptoms to be
expressed and the long distance and rapid movement of the Asian
citrus psyllid has led to the widespread establishment of the disease
within just a few years.

State and federal officials will continue to track the movement of
HLB across Florida while developing management practices to control
the disease's impact on the state's citrus industry, combined with an
education program for growers. But it will be difficult, because not
much is known about HLB, and researchers say no method exists to
culture the greening bacteria in a laboratory.

Scientists and regulatory officials agreed that much remains unknown
about this disease. Although well-distributed throughout the
citrus-growing areas of the world, many key aspects of the disease
and how to best manage it are still little known.

[HLB is a lethal disease of citrus caused by a phloem-limited
bacterium (Candidatus _Liberibacter asiaticus_). It is one of the
most severe diseases affecting citrus production in tropical and
sub-tropical regions of the world, and has recently spread to citrus
orchards in southern areas of Japan and Brazil. HLB is transmitted by
the Asiatic citrus psyllid.

Diagnosis of this disease is usually conducted through symptom
observation and PCR detection, but these methods do not allow the
quantification of pathogen numbers. The quantification of pathogens
is crucial for analyzing the process of disease development. Based on
recent research results, Japanese scientists have developed a
quantification system for HLB utilizing a competitive PCR method.
This system consists of conventional PCR equipment and competitor
DNA, and is less expensive than equipment used in real-time PCR
systems, which currently is the most popular method for
quantification of PCR-detectable materials. Thus, this system will be
more easily incorporated into agricultural research activities in
developing countries.

HLB is seen commonly in southeast Asia and is moving north from
Taiwan to the south of Nansei island, located to the south of Kyushu
island through the Ryukyu islands of Okinawa. A significant number of
citrus trees died of HLB a year after the 1st infected trees was
reported. The main citrus-producing region is located near these
infested small islands. Fortunately, the psyllid cannot survive under
winter conditions in the southern part of Kyushu island at present.
However, under warmer conditions, it will be able to survive. The
Japanese government is sincerely concerned about the spread of HLB
and the psyllid because of typhoon activities, which bring the pest
and disease to the main citrus growing area. Recently, HLB was
reported to be found in Brazil, and will be a serious problem on the
American continent if it is not controlled. Citrus pathologists
worldwide should be closely monitoring spread of HLB.
