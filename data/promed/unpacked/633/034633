Panic gripped Gorakhpur's Belghat area on Monday [25 May 2020] after over 300 bats were found dead in a mango orchard.

Even as the authorities rushed to the site to collect carcasses and send it for medical examination to ascertain the reason behind mysterious deaths, rumours on social media linked it with coronavirus outbreak, albeit without any scientific basis.

Many thought it could be because of heat and absence of water body around prompting locals to arrange water pots for mammals.

Reports said carcasses were strewn on ground in orchard and were first spotted by locals.

"We received information about death of bats at around 8 am following which our ranger went to the site and collected around 58 carcasses in a jar. These will be sent to Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) Bareilly for autopsy. Prima facie they appeared to have died of heat stroke or could also be a case of consumption of insecticides," said Avinash Kumar, district forest officer.

"The bats used to live on nearby trees. The forest officer believes that they might have died of heat and absence of water and have asked us to place water pots here for bats. A brick kiln is also located close to the orchard and its pollution may have also caused deaths," said the orchard owner.

Professor PH Pathak of the department of zoology at DDU Gorakhpur University said: "The disease white-nose syndrome which is caused by fungus may be the possible reason behind the mass deaths of bats. The disease has been reported abroad in which the entire colonies of bats die."

White-nose syndrome is an emergent disease of hibernating bats that has spread from the northeastern to the central United States at an alarming rate.

"Never in the past we have seen bats dying like this. This is mysterious," said a local.

[There is a need for post mortem examination, lab tests, and other steps of a thorough outbreak investigation to be able to speculate possible causes of these deaths. Hopefully, those are being carried out at IVRI and will shed light on what has caused these deaths. - Mod.PMB
