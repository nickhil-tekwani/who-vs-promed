[El Menia district, in the province Ghardaia, is located in central Algeria, bordering the Sahara dunes on its south; see map at http://tinyurl.com/gwdm3qb. The meaning of "Sabkhat el Malah" is "salt marsh."

It will be interesting to assess the role of the H7N1 AI virus in the event. Has its high pathogenicity been based on the field observations, or confirmed in the lab? Genotyping is warranted. Further investigation by a reference laboratory deserves consideration. - Mod.AS
