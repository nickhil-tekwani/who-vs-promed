Increasing resistance to quinolones among campylobacter isolates from
humans has been reported in Europe and Asia, but not in the United States.
This study evaluated resistance to quinolones among campylobacter isolates
from Minnesota residents during the period from 1992 through 1998.
4,953 campylobacter isolates from humans received by the Minnesota
Department of Health were tested for resistance to nalidixic acid.
Resistant isolates and selected sensitive isolates were tested for
resistance to ciprofloxacin. The proportion of quinolone-resistant _C.
jejuni_ isolates from humans increased from 1.3 percent in 1992 to 10.2
percent in 1998 (P<0.001).
Ciprofloxacin-resistant _C. jejuni_ was isolated from 14 percent of 91
domestic chicken products obtained from retail markets in 1997. Molecular
subtyping showed an association between resistant _C. jejuni_ strains from
chicken products and domestically acquired infections in Minnesota
residents.
The increase in quinolone-resistant _C. jejuni_ infections in Minnesota is
largely due to infections acquired during foreign travel. However, the
number of quinolone-resistant infections acquired domestically has also
increased, largely because of the acquisition of resistant strains from
poultry. The use of fluoroquinolones in poultry, which began in the United
States in 1995, has created a reservoir of resistant _C. jejuni_.
