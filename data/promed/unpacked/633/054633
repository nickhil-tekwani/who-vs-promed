Hop stunt viroid (HSVd), a member of the family _Pospiviroidae_, was 1st
described as the causal agent of hop stunt disease in Japan. It has since
been found in a wide range of hosts, including herbaceous and woody hosts
(e.g. hop, cucumber, grapevine, citrus, plum, peach, pear, apricot, almond,
and pomegranate). It was also detected and characterized in apricot, where
infection appears to be latent (1).
The viroid occurs frequently in apricot. In southeastern Spain, the
presence of HSVd was found to infect 81 percent of apricot trees (2).
Apricots originated in China and are extensively cultivated, but HSVd
infection in this host has not been reported.
In September 2005, a single symptomatic apricot tree, Yin Bai, one of the
most popular and widely grown cultivars in China, was discovered at the
Institute of Fruit Science in Changping District in Beijing, People's
Republic of China. Observed symptoms included a number of yellow spots with
an irregular border that scattered in an irregular manner over the leaf
surface. Total RNA was extracted and used for return-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) (4). Results of both assays were positive for HSVd. A 297-bp
full-length DNA fragment was amplified by RT-PCR using primers R1
(5(prime)-GCTGGATTCTGAGAAGAGTT-3(prime)) complementary to HSVd residues
87-106 for the RT reaction, followed by R2 (5(prime)-AACCCGGGGCTCCTT
TCTCA-3(prime)) complementary to HSVd residues 67-84 and forward primer F3
(5(prime)-AACCCGGGGCAACTCTTCTC-3(prime)) residues 79-96 for PCR. The
primers are located in the strictly conserved central region of the HSVd
group and contain the unique endonuclease restriction site SmaI. The
amplified products were cloned into pGEM-T (Promega, Madison, WI) and
selected for further analysis on the basis of the results of restriction
digests. Six individual clones were sequenced and 3 different sequences
were obtained. Nucleic acid sequence (GenBank Accession No. DQ362901)
obtained from one clone was 99.3 percent (nucleotide changes T(^206)--C,
C(^233)--T) identical to HSVd.apr8 (GenBank Accession No. Y09349) (3).
Sequence (GenBank Accession No. DQ362904) obtained from 3 clones was 99.7
percent (nucleotide change C(^233)--T) and a 3rd sequence (GenBank
Accession No. DQ362905) obtained from 2 clones was 99.3 percent (nucleotide
changes G(^107)--A, C(^233)--T) identical to HSVd.apr8. Further
investigation is necessary to determine whether the symptoms observed are
associated with the viroid infection. To our knowledge, this is the 1st
report of HSVd isolated from apricot in China.

[The fruit crop plant apricot, _Prunus armeniaca_, develops mild or no
symptoms when infected by the hop stunt viroid (family: _Pospiviroidae_,
genus: _Hostuviroid_, HSVd). It consists of a 295-303 nucleotide circular
single-stranded RNA. HSVd has been found in a wide range of herbaceous and
woody hosts, where the infection seems to be latent (such as grapevine,
apricot, pear) or may induce specific disease symptoms such as hop stunt,
citrus cachexia, and dapple fruit of plum and peach. It has also been
reported in cucumber.
The detection of HSVd in apricot in China for the 1st time is significant
in part because this is the geographical origin of the species and because
of the threat this pathogen could have to the other crops it infects. Like
other viroids, HSVd is transmitted mechanically, by budding and grafting,
and by vegetative propagation. The isolates sequenced all came from a
single tree, showing disease symptoms. It is not clear whether HSVd is
widespread in apricot in China, as could be the case, and, if it was, the
cause of symptoms in the single tree tested. Note that this is not the 1st
report of HSVd in China, where it has been reported in grape (20051222.366).
At present, isolates of HSVd are divided into at least 5 groups using
sequence data obtained from Spain, France, Italy, USA and Japan: 3 major
groups (plum-type, hop-type and citrus-type) each containing isolates from
only a limited number of isolation hosts and 2 minor groups that are
presumed to derive from recombination events between members of the main
groups. It is not clear from the article with which group the new Chinese
isolates should be included. A web link is provided to the sequence of the
isolate they most resembled, HSVd.apr8 (GenBank Accession No. Y09349).
