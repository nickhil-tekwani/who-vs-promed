A 27-year-old man from Mundra taluka of Kutch district [Gujarat state] who died on Thursday [26 Mar 2015] had contracted Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus, lab reports have confirmed.

The victim has been identified as a resident of Ratadiya village in Mundra taluka of Kutch. Health officials of Kutch said that the man had come down with fever on 22 Mar [2015]. After taking treatment in Mundra and Bhuj towns in Kutch, he was referred to a private hospital in Rajkot where he died on Thursday [26 Mar 2015].

"Doctors of the private hospital in Rajkot had informed us on 26 Mar [2015] that the patient had displayed symptoms of CCHF. His blood samples were sent to National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune. After tests, NIV confirmed on Saturday [28 Mar 2015] that the patient had contracted the CCHF virus," Dr Satish Makwana, chief district health officer (CDHO) of Kutch told The Indian Express on Sunday [29 Mar 2015].

Health officials said that the man used to work with a transport firm in Mundra and that his home in Ratadiya was near an enclosure for cattle. CCHF spreads through ticks, parasites living on animals.

"After the NIV report, we screened rest of his family members and surveyed each of 269 families living in Ratadiya village. We also alerted animal husbandry department officials. They observed that cattle in the village had ticks. We even found ticks in a mound of sand near the victim's residence," Dr Makwana further said.

The CDHO added that the rest of the residents had not displayed any symptoms of the Congo fever and that insecticides had been sprayed in the village to kill ticks.

Incidentally, CCHF deaths were reported from Kariyana village of Babra taluka in Amreli district [Gujarat state] in year 2013.

[There was a previous suspected case of CCHF in Gujarat state reported on 18 Feb 2015. CCHF virus is endemic in Gujarat state, and human cases have occurred there as recently as last year (2014). The way in which this and previously reported CCHF virus infections were acquired is not stated. As noted in ProMED-mail archive no. 20150128.3124546, the virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp. ticks or through contact with infected human blood or animal blood and tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Exposure in health care facilities also occurs. The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days.

The CDC states, "Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is caused by infection with a tick-borne virus (_Nairovirus_) in the family _Bunyaviridae_. The disease was 1st characterized in the Crimea in 1944 and given the name Crimean hemorrhagic fever. It was then later recognized in 1969 as the cause of illness in the Congo, thus resulting in the current name of the disease.

The virus is sensitive in vitro to the antiviral drug ribavirin. It has been used in the treatment of CCHF patients reportedly with some benefit (http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/crimean-congo/). However, no mention is made of use of the drug in the treatment of the case above.
