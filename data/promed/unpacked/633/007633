Update on Bovine Tuberculosis Incident in Queensland, Australia
----------------------------------------------------------------
Despite media reports indicating the spread of bovine tuberculosis (TB)
from the property in northwest Queensland, strong evidence is accumulating
that this has not occurred. It remains that only 2 animals have been
confirmed with the disease - both on the case property.
Investigations by Queensland Department of Primary Industries animal health
authorities have established that over the past 7 years, cattle have moved
from the case property to 20 other properties. These movements have
occurred as part of normal trading activities.
Six of the 20 properties held the cattle they received for short periods of
time before commercially disposing of them. None of these cattle remain
alive and these properties have been deemed to require no further action.
A further 8 properties continue to hold cattle for medium-term
fattening. On these properties, official programs of quarantine including
control measures involving disposal to slaughter or testing for TB have
been put in place. Of the 200 cattle TB tested so far, no positive animals
have been detected.
Of the remaining 6 of the 20 properties, 3 contain cattle which had been on
agistment (temporary relocation for grazing purposes on a commercial basis)
at the case property for varying periods up to 3 years. These cattle are
also subject to official movement controls until eventual disposal to
slaughter or testing.
Three other properties now contain the majority of breeding cattle that were
removed from the case property. These cattle are also subject to
quarantine. Of the total of 8600 head of breeding cattle on these 3
properties, over 6000 have been sent for slaughter, with the remainder to
be consigned as soon as can be arranged. In addition a further 400 cattle
have been consigned for slaughter from the case property. No TB has been
detected in any of these slaughtered cattle.
All cattle consigned for slaughter have been subject to post-mortem
examinations for the presence of lesions that are in any way suspicious for
tuberculosis. Granulomas have been detected in 17 of the above animals and
submitted under the ongoing National Granuloma Submission Program for
histopathological examination at state veterinary laboratories.
Tuberculosis has not been detected in any of the lesions examined.
It should be noted the case property is 770 000 hectares (1.9 million
acres) in area and has contained up to 30 000 cattle. Many of the cattle
that have been moved from the property have been in paddocks up to 50 km
from the area where the infected animals were mustered. These cattle are
at low risk of infection but are being included in the above-mentioned
controls in order to leave no opportunity for possible disease spread.
Queensland animal health authorities continue to monitor and control this
incident.
