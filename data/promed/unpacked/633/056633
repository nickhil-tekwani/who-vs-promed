Oregon Public Healthy officials say alfalfa sprouts from California
are causing a salmonellosis outbreak in several states including
Oregon. The cause of the outbreak has been traced to sprouts produced
by Caldwell Fresh Foods of Maywood, CA, sold under several label
names in Oregon.

So far, 23 people from 10 states, including a Multnomah (OR) infant,
have been infected with _Salmonella_, and 4 of them including the
baby, have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported. In
Oregon, sprouts were sold at Wal-Mart, Trader Joe's and other
locations, including restaurants and delis. Caldwell is recalling the
affected sprouts.

A Los Angeles County firm issued a nationwide recall of alfalfa
sprouts Fri 21 May 2010, after a salmonella outbreak that has
sickened more than 20 people in 10 states. "We're very sorry that
this has happened," said Maurie Thomas, general manager at
Maywood-based Caldwell Fresh Foods. "Alfalfa sprouts are strictly
controlled" by the FDA. "We follow all of their guidelines to a T."

The alfalfa sprouts were grown in Maywood and sold at supermarkets
and restaurants around the country, including at certain Trader Joe's
and Wal-Mart locations in California.

Thomas said federal and state health officials visited the company
Thu 20 May 2010, to test for traces of salmonella, including taking
samples of finished products and swabs of facility equipment.

Of the consumers reported as getting sick, one was an infant in
Oregon and 11 were from California, the company said. 4 people were
hospitalized.

What is the Problem?
--------------------
Caldwell Fresh Foods of Maywood, CA, is voluntarily recalling all of
its alfalfa sprouts marketed under the Caldwell Fresh Foods, Nature's
Choice, and California Exotics brands. The firm's alfalfa sprouts
have been linked to an outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype]
Newport infections in consumers in 10 states. As of 20 May 2010 and
since 1 Mar 2010, a total of 22 cases of _S._ Newport infections have
been confirmed in Arizona (1), California (11), Colorado (1), Idaho
(1), Illinois (1), Missouri (1), New Mexico (1), Nevada (2), Oregon
(1), and Wisconsin (2). 6 of the cases have been hospitalized. No
deaths have been reported.

Who is at Risk?
---------------
All consumers and restaurant/delicatessen operators should
immediately stop using Caldwell Fresh Foods raw alfalfa sprouts. The
FDA reminds consumers that children, the elderly, pregnant women and
persons with weakened immune systems should avoid eating raw sprouts
of any kind (including alfalfa, clover, radish and mung bean
sprouts). More information for consumers about avoiding the risks
associated with eating sprouts is available at
<http://www.foodsafety.gov/keep/types/fruits/sprouts.html>.

What do the Products Look Like?
-------------------------------
The recalled alfalfa sprouts are labeled and packaged as follows:

- Caldwell Fresh Foods - 4-ounce plastic cups and 1-pound plastic
bags, and 2-pound and 5-pound plastic bags in cardboard boxes with
sticker affixed with the printed words 'Caldwell Fresh Foods'

Nature's Choice - 4-ounce plastic cups

California Exotics brands - 5-ounce plastic clamshell containers

Where are they distributed?
--------------------------
The sprouts were distributed to a variety of restaurants,
delicatessens and retailers including Trader Joe's and Wal-Mart stores.

How was the Outbreak Detected?
------------------------------
Cooperative investigation by state and local health departments and
the CDC have linked the outbreak to consumption of Caldwell Fresh
Foods' alfalfa sprouts. Some outbreak patients reported eating
sprouts at restaurants; others purchased the sprouts at retail outlets.
