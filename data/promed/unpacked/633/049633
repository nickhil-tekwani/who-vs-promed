Australia quarantines farm to contain H7 bird flu outbreak
----------------------------------------------------------
Australia's 1st outbreak of a highly pathogenic bird flu virus in 15 years should be contained by a cull of 50 000 chickens, authorities said on Friday [16 Nov 2012], although they do not know what caused the case at an egg farm in New South Wales state.

The Department of Primary Industries (DPI) said all chickens at the property in Maitland, 160 km [99.4 mi] north of Sydney, will be destroyed after the H7 virus was detected last week.

The H7 strain is highly pathogenic to birds but is not related to the H5N1 strain, which was first detected in 1997 in Hong Kong and has since caused hundreds of human deaths.

DPI [Department of Primary Industries] chief veterinary officer Ian Roth said the strain did not present any risks to food safety from poultry and eggs.

An unidentified strain of bird flu has been detected at a hen farm near Maitland in the Hunter Valley [New South Wales], prompting authorities to quarantine about 50 000 chickens. The suspected virus is not thought to be the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu that has killed 359 people worldwide in sporadic outbreaks since 2003.

Nonetheless, the 50 000 hens may have to be destroyed, the NSW Department of Primary Industries said. A "1st response team" of specialists from the department is on site to enforce the quarantine, while the CSIRO [Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation] runs lab tests on samples of the virus, with results expected this afternoon [15 Nov 2012].

"The suspected virus is definitely not the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain that has gained worldwide attention -- nor is it closely related to that strain," the NSW chief veterinary officer, Ian Roth, said in a statement. "Australia has previously had a small number of outbreaks of avian influenza viruses, which were all quickly and successfully eradicated," Dr Roth said. "The property has been placed under quarantine and initial tracing and surveillance is being undertaken to confirm that the virus hasn't spread. We currently have no evidence to suggest it has." The department said Australia has had 5 outbreaks of avian influenza in chickens between 1976 and 1997 -- 3 in Victoria and 1 each in NSW and Queensland.

[Avian influenza (AI) viruses infect domestic poultry and wild birds. In domestic poultry, AI viruses are typically of low pathogenicity (LP), causing subclinical infections, respiratory disease, or drops in egg production. However, a few AI viruses cause severe systemic infections with high mortality. This highly pathogenic (HP) form of the disease has historically been called fowl plague. The term fowl plague is not in use much recently. In most wild birds, AI viral infections are subclinical.

The incubation period is highly variable and ranges from a few days to one week. Transmission between individual birds is by ingestion or inhalation. Experimentally, cats have been infected with one strain of H5N1 Asian HPAI following respiratory exposure, ingestion of infected chickens, or contact with infected cats. Potentially, domestic house cats could serve as a transmission vector between farms, but the ability of other AI viruses, including other H5N1 strains, to infect cats is unknown. Transmission between farms is the result of breaches in biosecurity practices, principally by movement of infected birds or contaminated feces and respiratory secretions on fomites such as equipment or clothing. Airborne dissemination may be important over limited distances.

These AI viruses typically produce respiratory signs such as ocular and nasal discharge and swollen infraorbital sinuses. Sinusitis is common in domestic ducks, quail, and turkeys. Lesions in the respiratory tract typically include congestion and inflammation of the trachea and lungs. In layers and breeders, there may be decreased egg production or fertility, ova rupture (evident as yolk in the abdominal cavity) or involution, or mucosal edema and inflammatory exudates in the lumen of the oviduct. Some layer and breeder chickens may have acute renal failure and visceral urate deposition (visceral gout). The morbidity and mortality are usually low unless accompanied by secondary bacterial or viral infections or aggravated by environmental stress factors.

Even in the absence of secondary pathogens, HP viruses cause severe, systemic disease with high mortality in chickens, turkeys, and other gallinaceous birds. In peracute cases, clinical signs or gross lesions may be lacking before death. However, in acute cases, lesions may include cyanosis and edema of the head, comb, and wattle; edema and discoloration of the shanks and feet due to subcutaneous ecchymotic hemorrhages; petechial hemorrhages on visceral organs and in muscles; and blood-tinged oral and nasal discharges. In severely affected birds, greenish diarrhea is common. Birds that survive the fulminating infection may develop CNS involvement evident as torticollis, opisthotonos, or incoordination. The location and severity of microscopic lesions are highly variable and may consist of edema, hemorrhage, and necrosis in parenchymal cells of multiple visceral organs, skin, and CNS.

LP AI must be differentiated from other respiratory diseases or causes of decreased egg production including: 1) acute to subacute viral diseases such as infectious bronchitis, infectious laryngotracheitis, lentogenic Newcastle disease, and infections by other paramyxoviruses; 2) bacterial diseases such as mycoplasmosis, infectious coryza, ornithobacteriosis, turkey coryza, and the respiratory form of fowl cholera; and 3) fungal diseases such as aspergillosis. HPAI must be differentiated from other causes of high mortality such as velogenic Newcastle disease, peracute septicemic fowl cholera, heat exhaustion, and severe water deprivation.

Vaccines can prevent clinical signs and death. Furthermore, viral replication and shedding from the respiratory and GI tracts may be reduced in vaccinated birds. Specific protection is achieved through autogenous virus vaccines or from vaccines prepared from AI virus of the same hemagglutinin subtype. Antibodies to the viral neuraminidase antigens may provide some protection.

AI viruses can adapt to humans. However, it is not necessarily a rapid adaptation but precautions should be taken.

There have been other avian influenza outbreaks in Australia in 2012, but they are low pathogenic varieties. So the authorities are surely watching this one closely.

As of 18 Nov 2012, I have not seen any releases from Australia indicating specifically the type of virus or the plan. We would appreciate more accurate information from the Australian authorities.
