St James banana farmers bracing for impact of Moko disease
--------------------------
A section of one affected banana field in Maroon Town, St James,
where farmers have complained that both their banana and plantain
plants, have started to show wilting and reduced fruit size,
symptomatic of Moko disease. Western Bureau banana farmers in
Southern St James are already tallying losses they expect to incur
from destruction of 20 acres of fields infected with the disease.
Leroy Grey estimated that he stands to lose over $1.5 million if his
10-acre field in Maroon Town is among those that will be destroyed.
Grey told the Observer that he will lose the field and his investment
of $120 000 to $150 000 per acre. He also had concerns about the cost
for new fields and the replanting of a new crop.
Robert Chambers, proprietor of Maroon Pride banana chips factory in
Maroon Town, said that if the disease becomes widespread, over 3000
farmers are expected to be adversely affected. "120 farmers sell us
bananas and another 50 work directly or indirectly at the chips
factory." Farmers, as well as those who produce banana chips, are
bracing for the effect of the disease on their sole source of income.
On Thu 11 Mar 2004, Agriculture Minister Roger Clarke announced that
20 acres of banana fields from 5 farms in St James would be destroyed
in a move to curb disease spread.

[Moko disease of banana is caused by the bacterium _Ralstonia
solanacearum_ [Rs], race 2 (biovar 1). The disease occurs in
Trinidad, Amazonian Brazil, Peru, Guatemala, southern Mexico,
Grenada, Philippines, and Central and South America. Moko disease is
considered a greater threat to both commercial and subsistence
farmers than _Fusarium_ spp.and Sigatoka leaf spot of bananas caused
by 2 related ascomycetous fungi (_Mycosphaerella fijiensis_ and _M.
musicola_), which incite black leaf streak disease and Sigatoka
disease, respectively. More than 85 000 farmers grow bananas on about
10 000 hectares of land in several parishes. The industry earned more
than USD 27 million in 2003 and is a constant cash flow for thousands
in barely marginal existence. Rs also infects tomato, taro, and
coconut.
Unfortunately there is no known resistance to Rs. The pathogen is
spread rapidly by insects contaminated with bacteria following
foraging on infected floral tissues. Disease management is difficult
and expensive, and can only be effectively implemented on large
commercial plantations due to cost.
Recommendations to restrict the spread of the disease include weekly
inspection of crops for symptoms and strict implementation of
standard phytosanitary measures. Replanting of any field with banana,
plantain or other host crops should be prohibited for at least a year
after infected plants have been killed. Movement of vehicles from an
infected farm to other banana or plantain fields should be prohibited.
