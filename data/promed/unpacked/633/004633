Ten new cases of jaundice-positive patients have been identified today, 27 Mar 2016, taking the number of infected persons to 37.

"Of the blood samples collected, 10 fresh cases have been detected today [27 Mar 2016]. By yesterday, the number of jaundice-positive cases was 27," Cuttack Chief District Medical Officer (CDMO) Prafulla Kumar Behera said.

Eleven jaundice cases were reported here yesterday, 26 Mar 2016, prompting the government to open a 24-hour health camp in the city. The district administration set up the round-the-clock health camp in Jobra area yesterday to extend free treatment to the patients.

District administration and Cuttack Municipal Corporation (CMC) authorities have geared up to detect leakages in the underground piped water supply system. An emergency meeting comprising Health and Family Welfare Minister Atanu Sabyasachi Nayak, Housing and Urban Development Minister Pushpendra Singhdeo and District Collector Nirmal Chandra Mishra had reviewed the jaundice situation in the city yesterday, 26 Mar 2016.

"The capacity of the mobile team engaged in collecting blood samples has been increased from 6 to 20," Atanu Sabyasachi Nayak told the media here.

[The etiology of this presumed waterborne outbreak of hepatitis is not stated but is likely to be either type A or E. If the cases are primarily in adults and if there are fatalities in pregnant women, type E viral hepatitis is likely the cause.

Odisha is one of the 29 states of India, located in the east of India. It is surrounded by the states of West Bengal to the northeast, Jharkhand to the north, Chhattisgarh to the west and northwest, and Andhra Pradesh to the south and southwest and can be found on a map at:

In view of the possibility of importing yellow fever - to which Indian newsmedia are alert because of cases from Angola arriving in China -- all cases of jaundice seen nowadays should be tested to exclude yellow fever. - Mod.JW
