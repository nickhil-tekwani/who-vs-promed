A hantavirus cases has been confirmed in Campana [Buenos Aires]. The case is a 19 year old youth who was treated and evaluated by medical professionals in the San Jose Municipal Hospital, and despite being in good health, remains hospitalized under observation.

This information was issued by the Secretary of Health, Ernesto Meiraldi, the Chief of Epidemiology of the San Jose Municipal Hospital, Eleonora Penovi, and the infectious disease physician Federico Simioli, who recommended cleaning homes with water and bleach, ventilating closed spaces, mainly storage sheds, keeping grass short, and not accumulating waste food, in order to prevent the disease.

The health professionals commented that the symptoms are high fever without cold symptoms, headache, muscle and abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, among others.

For these reasons, the Office of Bromatology [study of food] and Zoonoses is carrying out trash removal and general cleanup in the patient's house, as well as giving these relevant recommendations to the neighbors.

Within this framework, Meiraldi stated that infected rodents, that usually inhabit rural areas or those that are in areas with bad conditions of cleanliness, eliminate the virus into the environment through feces and urine, transmitting it to people via the respiratory route.

Penovi explained that there is no specific treatment for hantavirus [infections], so that prevention is fundamental, taking all the measures mentioned to avoid the long-tailed rat that transmits the infection [virus], to resolve the situation.

"The most effective preventive measure is to keep the rats far from the house," Simioli stated, and also mentioned that in case of any doubts the neighbors can communicate with the Office for Zoonoses.

[It is odd that there is no mention of the symptoms for this case, nor the basis for making the diagnosis as a hantavirus infection. As with the report above, the reports of hantavirus infections that ProMED receives very seldom mention which hantavirus is the etiologic agent of the case. However, a previous report in 2017 (Hantavirus - Americas (16): Chile (LR), Argentina (BA), USA (PA) 20170220.4850930) indicated that the hantavirus involved in Buenos Aires province was Buenos Aires hantavirus. In that previous case, of the 3 subtypes of Andes lineage virus, Lechiguanas and Plata were discarded and Buenos Aires was matched by the Molecular Biology Service of the Carlos Malbran Institute. The case above might have been due to infection by this virus.

Although the long-tailed mouse was mentioned as the rodent host in the report above, the rodent host of this virus has not been determined. The long-tailed mouse (pygmy rice rat _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), is the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus that is found in the Andean region of Argentina and Chile, much further west than Buenos Aires province.

The Bío Bío Regional Ministerial Secretariat stated that the 1st case of [a] hantavirus infection in 2018 was confirmed, involving a 57-year-old man.

According to Biobiochile, the infected person worked carrying hay bales the week before Christmas in a shed in the Llollinco area.

This case, confirmed on [4 Jan 2018], is added to the registered cases in 2017 since the man had a health consultation [31 Dec 2017], making it 18 people who were affected during last year [2017].

The patients confirmed with hantavirus [infections] were one in Concepción province, 8 in Ñuble, and 3 in Arauco.

[As noted in previous comments, much of central and southern Chile, including the Bío Bío region, is endemic for Andes hantavirus. The report above provides limited information about the circumstances under which the man acquired his hantavirus infection, but it may have been due to exposure to rodent reservoir hosts of the virus or to virus-contaminated rodent excreta in his environment while carrying bales or working in the shed. Cases of human hantavirus infections occur fairly frequently in the endemic region.

Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and then only with very close physical contact, usually within the family.

Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg.
