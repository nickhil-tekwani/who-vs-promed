Hong Kong: 2 More children Ill at Caritas Medical Centre
--------------------------------------------------------
2 more children have come down with fever and symptoms of respiratory
infections in a hospital where an outbreak of [respiratory disease]
has claimed one life and stricken another 33.
It is not yet known whether the 2 are suffering from the
parainfluenza virus infection, which 19 of the infected children were
found to have contracted, health officials said. The Health
Department said the respiratory virus (PIV), the 2nd most common
cause of acute respiratory illness in children, was found in
specimens taken from patients of the Caritas Medical Centre, where an
11-year-old girl with chronic medical problems died of a chest
infection on 9 Nov 2004. The child's death raised fears of a SARS or
avian influenza outbreak.
Of the 36 children that have so far been isolated after displaying
symptoms of [respiratory disease], 3 have fully recovered. The
outbreak started on 5 Nov 2004 and quickly spread. It was initially
thought the mystery illness could be related to the killer Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or the deadly H5N1 strain of avian
influenza virus, but SARS and avian influenza virus were quickly
ruled out by the health authorities.

[The report that 19 of the 36 affected children have tested positive
for parainfluenza virus infection is new. The report implies
indirectly that the children have contracted human parainfluenza
virus 3, and possibly not human parainfluenza virus 4 as previously
reported. Further clarification is awaited. - Mod.CP]
