News of the response
High level visit to Goma and Butembo
---------------------------------------
- A high-level delegation visited Goma and Butembo on Fri [8 Mar 2019] and Sat [9 Mar 2019]. The delegation included the Minister of Health, the Director General of WHO, the Director of the CDC, the Ambassador of the United States, Ms. Alma Golden (USAID), Mr. David Gressly (MONUSCO), representatives in the DRC of WHO and UNICEF, as well as high-level representatives of the World Bank.
- In Goma, a dinner was organized on Fri [8 Mar 2019] evening with the response teams to celebrate the women of the response on the occasion of International Women's Day.
- The next day [Sat 9 Mar 2019], the delegation was in Butembo to meet the teams who faced a new attack at the Butembo Ebola Treatment Center (ITAV). Early in the morning, heavily armed men attempted to attack the ETC. Having been informed of a possible attack, the security forces had pre-positioned themselves around the ETC, and this helped to repel the attackers and save several lives. A policeman protecting the ETC died in the shootout, and several assailants were captured.
- The Minister of Health then exchanged with the medical staff who managed to calm the patients who all remained in their isolation rooms until the end of the shooting. They praised the quick intervention of the security forces who saved their lives. They asked the Minister of Health to advocate for their safety and that of their loved ones so that they can continue to save lives.

Vaccination

The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 7 Mar 2019:
- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 918, with 853 confirmed and 65 probable. In total, there were 578 deaths (513 confirmed and 65 probable) and 306 people recovered.
- 190 suspected cases are under investigation.
- 5 new confirmed cases, including 2 in Katwa, 1 Kalunguta, 1 in Lubero and 1 in Mandima.
- 4 new confirmed cases deaths: 2 community deaths, including 1 in Kalunguta and 1 in Lubero; 2 deaths from confirmed cases at Butembo ETC.

News of the response
New health zone affected: Lubero
-----------------------------------
- A confirmed case has been reported in Lubero. This is the 20th health zone that has recorded at least one case of Ebola during the epidemic. This is a young woman who is the known contact of a confirmed patient who died on 21 Feb 2019 in Butembo. She categorically refused to be vaccinated and to follow 21-day contacts. When she became ill, she consulted a tradipractician [traditional doctor] before taking home treatment. She died at home. The response team installed in Lubero for several months has ensured the completion of a safe and dignified burial, as well as the listing of her contacts.

Vaccination
----------
- Immunization of frontline health workers in the health zones of Mweso and Kibirizi began on Thu 7 Mar 2019. These 2 health zones are neighboring areas in Katwa that currently have the highest number of confirmed cases. Visitors from Katwa regularly visit these areas. Thus, to protect health workers, the coordination decided to vaccinate all providers in the surrounding health zones to limit the spread of the disease.

Since the start of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 86 346 people have been vaccinated [see total numbers per location at the source URL above].

[2] Butembo ETC, 2nd attack

[Radio Okapi, abridged, edited]
https://www.radiookapi.net/2019/03/09/actualite/sante/rdc-nouvelle-attaque-du-centre-de-traitement-ebola-de-butembo

The Ebola treatment center (ETC) in Butembo City was again attacked early Sat morning [9 Mar 2019]. According to security sources, around 6:30 am (local time), heavily armed assailants launched an assault on the structure in Kimeni commune before being repelled by the defense and security forces after an exchange of fire for about 30 minutes.

According to the same sources, the provisional record of this attack shows one policeman killed and another wounded. This is the 2nd armed attack at the ETC in Butembo, after that of Wed 27 Feb [2019]. When the ETC reopened a week ago, the mayor of Butembo announced the deployment of police and army personnel around ETCs in North Kivu to protect them from armed attacks.

[WHO, edited]
https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/09-03-2019-who-director-general-reiterates-commitment-to-ebola-response-despite-another-attack

WHO Director-General, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus today [9 Mar 2019] visited an Ebola treatment centre in Butembo, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, that was attacked by armed groups last week and again earlier today. He spoke with personnel in the centre and thanked them for their dedication.

The visit came as he concluded a 3-day mission to the country, along with senior US officials and other WHO leadership. They met with the President, government officials, partner organizations and local responders involved in the outbreak response. He spoke to a group of partners, officials and staff in Butembo on Sat [9 Mar 2019] morning.

"It breaks my heart to think of the health workers injured and police officer who died in today's attack, as we continue to mourn those who died in previous attacks, while defending the right to health," said Dr. Tedros. "But we have no choice except to continue serving the people here, who are among the most vulnerable in the world."

"These are not attacks BY the community, they are attacks ON the community. There are elements who are exploiting the desperation of the situation for their own purposes. The people of Katwa and Butembo, as in the other communities affected by Ebola, want and deserve a place to receive care and a chance of survival. They do not deserve to suffer in their homes while infecting their loved ones; they do not deserve to suffer in inadequately resourced health centers while infecting health workers," he added.

WHO has requested and received further support from UN and local police forces to protect the treatment centres. "To conquer Ebola, we must strike a delicate balance between providing accessible care, maintaining the neutrality of the response, and protecting patients and staff from attacks by armed groups. These are the dilemmas we face in conflict zones around the world. We are committed to ending the outbreak, and we are committed to improving the health of the people of DRC," he concluded.

- Sat 9 Mar 2019. Congo's Mai Mai militiamen attack Ebola treatment center
[Reuters, abridged, edited]
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-ebola-congo/congos-mai-mai-militia-attacks-ebola-treatment-center-idUSKBN1QQ09G

Mai Mai militiamen attacked an Ebola treatment center at the heart of an outbreak of the disease in eastern Congo on Sat [9 Mar 2019], killing a policeman and wounding health workers before being repelled by security forces. The center in Butembo was the same one torched by unknown assailants last week, an attack that prompted medical aid agency Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) to suspend activities in the area.

Aid workers have faced deep mistrust in some areas as they work to contain the outbreak of the deadly hemorrhagic fever, the worst in Democratic Republic of Congo's history, killing close to 600 people so far. Efforts to contain the virus have been hampered by a plethora of armed groups operating in Congo's lawless east.

World Health Organisation (WHO) President Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus visited the Butembo center later on Sat [9 Mar 2019], a statement from the organization said. "It breaks my heart to think of the health workers injured and the police officer who died in today's attack, as we continue to mourn those who died in previous attacks, while defending the right to health," Tedros was quoted as saying. "But we have no choice except to continue serving the people here, who are among the most vulnerable in the world."

Butembo major Sylvain Kanyamanda Mbusa said the Mai Mai militants had been successfully beaten back. "Because of previous attacks, a security system was already in place and attackers were quickly confronted by the police officers guarding the...center," he told Reuters. The facility had resumed operations only a week ago and had been managed by the ministry of health in collaboration with the WHO and United Nations children's agency.

The Mai Mai take their name from the word for "water" in a local Swahili dialect, because some of their fighters believe magic can turn flying bullets into water. They comprise several armed bands that originally formed to resist 2 invasions by Rwandan forces in the late 1990s. They have since morphed into a variety of ethnic-based militia, smuggling networks and protection rackets.

One of the militiamen was wounded in Saturday's attack and is in custody, Kanyamanda Mbusa said.

On Thu [7 Mar 2019], MSF accused the Congolese government of failing to contain the epidemic because of an overly militarized response that was alienating patients and their families.

[3] Summary
- Thu 7 Mar 2019. Ebola virus disease - Democratic Republic of the Congo
[WHO Disease Outbreak News, abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/csr/don/7-march-2019-ebola-drc/en/

The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak is continuing with moderate intensity. Katwa and Butembo remain the major health zones of concern, while small clusters continue simultaneously in some geographically dispersed locations. During the past 21 days (13 Feb - 5 Mar 2019), 76 new confirmed and probable cases have been reported from 31 health areas within 9 health zones [see Fig. 1 at source URL], including Katwa (44), Butembo (17), Mandima (6), Masereka (3), Kalunguta (2), Beni (1), Vuhovi (1), Kyondo (1), and Rwampara (1). The emerging cluster in Mandima health zone is occurring in a previously unaffected village, with 5 of the recent cases epidemiologically linked and the 6th case likely exposed in Butembo; nonetheless, there remains a high risk of further spread. Similarly, recent cases (2 confirmed and 1 probable) in Masereka stem from a Butembo chain of transmission. These events highlight the importance for response teams to remain active across all areas, including those with lower case incidence, to rapidly detect new cases and prevent onward transmission.

As of 5 Mar 2019, 907 EVD cases (841 confirmed and 66 probable) have been reported, of which 57% (514) were female and 30% (273) were children aged less than 18 years. Cumulatively, cases have been reported from 121 of 301 health areas across 19 health zones of the North Kivu and Ituri provinces. Overall, 569 deaths (case fatality ratio, 63%) have been reported, and 304 patients have been discharged from Ebola treatment centres (ETCs). Although declining trends in case incidence are currently being observed, the high proportion of community deaths reported among confirmed cases, relatively low proportion of new cases who were known contacts under surveillance, persistent delays in detection and isolation in ETCs (related as well to recent violent incidents), and challenges in the timely reporting and response to probable cases, all increase the likelihood of further chains of transmission in affected communities and continued spread.

Following the attacks on 2 ETCs in Katwa and Butembo, patients were temporarily transferred to the Katwa Transit Centre. On 2 Mar 2019, the Butembo ETC was rehabilitated and resumed treatment of EVD patients. Response teams are progressively resuming activities in all affected areas with the exception of 2 health areas where security and community resistance remain a challenge.

- Fri 8 Mar 2019. Violence propels Ebola outbreak towards 1000 cases
[Nature, abridged, edited]
https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00805-7
[Byline: Amy Maxmen]

Surging conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is hampering efforts to stamp out the virus
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Epidemiologists say recent data from the World Health Organization (WHO) suggest the virus is spreading undetected. During the last 3 weeks of February [2019], 43% of the people who died from Ebola in Katwa and Butembo were found dead in their communities -- not isolated in hospitals in the late stages of the illness, when the disease is most infectious. And three-quarters of those diagnosed with Ebola had not previously been identified as contacts of people who had contracted the virus.

Taken together, the statistics suggest that the virus is spreading outside known chains of transmission, making it harder to contain and driving up the mortality rate compared with previous outbreaks. The current death rate of about 60% is higher than it was during the much larger 2014-2016 Ebola crisis in West Africa, despite improvements since then in how people with Ebola are cared for, including the introduction of several experimental drugs.

"We can have the best treatments in the world, but it won't decrease mortality if patients don't come in or come in too late," says Chiara Montaldo, medical coordinator for aid group Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF, also known as Doctors Without Borders) in the DRC's North Kivu province.

Uncharted territory
----------------
The region is home to dozens of armed groups, and is also a stronghold for opponents of the DRC's ruling political party. Many residents are suspicious of the effort to stamp out the Ebola outbreak because they see it as intertwined with the government's treatment of its political foes. The decision last year by former president Joseph Kabila to block people in the cities of Beni, Butembo and Yumbi from voting -- to prevent Ebola's spread -- exacerbated those suspicions.

A sustained response from the DRC Ministry of Health, the WHO and MSF, among other groups, has curtailed the outbreak in the communities where the virus 1st emerged, such as Mabalako, Komanda and Beni. But as people move, so does Ebola. The virus has spread into new areas, including Butembo and Katwa.

Sounding the alarm
-----------------
To help halt Ebola's spread, some health-policy analysts want the WHO to designate the DRC outbreak a public health emergency of international concern [PHEIC; see next report]. That could increase international cooperation and mobilize aid, as it did when the WHO declared a public emergency 7 months into the West African Ebola epidemic of 2014-2016.

The WHO estimates the cost of stamping out the current Ebola outbreak in the DRC at USD 148 million. As of 26 Feb 2019, WHO member countries had committed less than USD 10 million, according to the agency's director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

"If this isn't a global health emergency, what is?" says Lawrence Gostin, a health law and policy specialist at Georgetown University in Washington, DC. The ongoing conflict in the northeastern DRC makes the outbreak extraordinary, he says, and the thousands of people regularly passing from the northeastern DRC into South Sudan, Uganda and Rwanda increases the risk that the virus will spread.

Proponents of an emergency declaration say that it would enable the WHO to denounce government actions that could harm the Ebola response, such as the DRC's voting restrictions last year [2018] or the US' decision to stay out of the outbreak zone. A declaration could also put pressure on the DRC to improve health services and security in communities traumatized by Ebola and violence, says Oyewale Tomori, an independent virologist in Ibadan, Nigeria.

Since October [2018], the WHO has repeatedly decided against declaring a public health emergency, saying that Ebola is unlikely to spread globally and that aid groups are providing sufficient help to limit the outbreak. Some specialists in global health speculate that the WHO's reluctance to declare an emergency is influenced by geopolitical issues, too. Declaring an emergency might trigger countries around the DRC to block border checkpoints, for example, which could depress the region's economy and make it harder to know when people with Ebola enter other countries.

And David Heymann, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, says that leaders of armed groups in the region might use an emergency declaration as leverage to negotiate for territory, resources or power, in exchange for allowing Ebola responders to do their jobs. "Infectious agents can be held hostage," he says.

Then there's the issue of whether an emergency declaration does anything at all. Adia Benton, an anthropologist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, says that the turning point in the West Africa epidemic may not have been the decision to declare an emergency, but the news of a handful of cases of Ebola in the US. Whether the WHO sounds the alarm in the current outbreak, she fears that it will continue to fester -- just as the world has largely ignored arson, starvation and violence in the DRC for a quarter-century.

[Radio Moto, machine trans., abridged, edited]
http://radiomotofm.info/lirearticle.php?billet=5526

The deadline for the complete eradication of Ebola virus disease is 30 Apr 2019. In case of no control of the epidemic as of this date, Ebola will be declared an international emergency. Under these conditions, all entrances and exits will be closed to the population still living in the epidemic zone.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall

[I am not sure of the basis for the selection of 30 Apr 2019 as the deadline for eradication of Ebola, but it is unlikely to be accomplished by this date. The continuing violence against ETCs and the community deaths will facilitate spread of virus. It is very frustrating that in spite of the tools at hand, i.e., the ETCs, the vaccine, and antiviral compounds, as well as the expertise and dedication of the health care workers, the virus continues to smolder. - Mod.LK]

Ebola survivors in Liberia face ongoing health issues, study finds
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
Background: Multiple health problems have been reported in survivors of Ebola virus disease (EVD). Attribution of these problems to the disease without a control group for analysis is difficult.

Methods: We enrolled a cohort of EVD survivors and their close contacts and prospectively collected data on symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory results. A subset of participants underwent ophthalmologic examinations. Persistence of Ebola virus (EBOV) RNA in semen samples from survivors was determined.

Results: A total of 966 EBOV antibody-positive survivors and 2350 antibody-negative close contacts (controls) were enrolled, and 90% of these participants were followed for 12 months. At enrollment (median time to baseline visit, 358 days after symptom onset), 6 symptoms were reported significantly more often among survivors than among controls: urinary frequency (14.7% vs 3.4%), headache (47.6% vs 35.6%), fatigue (18.4% vs 6.3%), muscle pain (23.1% vs 10.1%), memory loss (29.2% vs 4.8%), and joint pain (47.5% vs 17.5%). On examination, more survivors than controls had abnormal abdominal, chest, neurologic, and musculoskeletal findings and uveitis. Other than uveitis (prevalence at enrollment, 26.4% vs 12.1%; at year 1, 33.3% vs 15.4%), the prevalence of these conditions declined during follow-up in both groups. The incidence of most symptoms, neurologic findings, and uveitis was greater among survivors than among controls. EBOV RNA was detected in semen samples from 30% of the survivors tested, with a maximum time from illness to detection of 40 months.

Conclusions: A relatively high burden of symptoms was seen in all participants, but certain symptoms and examination findings were more common among survivors. With the exception of uveitis, these conditions declined in prevalence during follow-up in both groups. Viral RNA in semen persisted for a maximum of 40 months.
