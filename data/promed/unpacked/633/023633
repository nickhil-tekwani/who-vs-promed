Swiss Scientists Decode Protein Linked to CJD
------------------------------------------
Swiss scientists said Tuesday they had decoded the three-dimensional
structure of the human prion protein, moving one step closer to unraveling
the cause of the deadly Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [CJD.
Prions appear naturally in the brain, but experts say these proteins can
mutate into dangerous forms, which are linked to diseases such as bovine
spongiform encephalopathy -- also known as BSE or mad cow disease -- and
CJD, its human form. These diseases cause the brain to waste away and are
always fatal.
The discovery by researchers at the Institute for Molecular Biology and
Biophysics at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich,
led by Professor Kurt Wuethrich, could shed light on how rogue prions
operate.
"The work forms the basis for future research on the structure and
function of the human prion, for the comparison with prion variants which
occur in diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob, and for studies on the possible
transmission of prion diseases between animals and humans,'' said the Swiss
National Science Foundation, which supported the research.
A team of ETH researchers, also led by Wuethrich, succeeded in decoding the
three-dimensional structure of a mouse's prion protein in 1997, marking the
first time an intact prion had been mapped.
The new ETH study focuses on the parts of the protein which are different
in humans and animals, because experts believe these areas may be linked to
the prion's mutation and could help explain what causes CJD.
The Swiss team's findings will be published in the January edition of the
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), the magazine of the
non-profit U.S.-based academy.
