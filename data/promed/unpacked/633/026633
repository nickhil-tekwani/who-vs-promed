The outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF) continues to evolve in Eastern Lakes state, South Sudan, with another county affected. As of 9 Mar 2018, a total of 40 cases and 4 deaths have been reported from Yirol East (37 cases, 4 deaths) and Yirol West (3 cases, no deaths) counties. Of these, a total of 6 confirmed, 3 probable, and 12 suspect RVF cases (with pending laboratory results) have been reported. Of the suspected cases, 19 were considered as non-cases following negative laboratory results for RVF. The majority of suspected cases have been women (57.1 percent), and individuals aged 20-39 years make up the majority (72.2 percent) of cases.

In week 10, 8 new suspected human cases were reported in Yirol East (5 cases) and Yirol West (3 cases). Samples have been collected from these cases, and 7 were shipped to the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) on 7 Mar 2018 for laboratory testing. As of 9 Mar 2018, there were no cases hospitalized. During the week, one human sample tested RVF IgG positive, bringing the cumulative number of confirmed RVF cases to 6 (one RVF IgM and IgG positive and 5 IgG-only positive).

Test results from 21 animal samples (from livestock) that were shipped to South Africa were released during the week; 8 were RVF positive (3 IgM-positive and 5 IgG-positive), 6 samples were classified as suspect RVF cases based on IgG and IgM serological titres, and 7 samples were negative. Since the beginning of the outbreak, a total of 28 animal samples have been tested, with 9 classified as RVF positive (3 IgM and 6 IgG), 6 classified as suspected RVF (based on IgG and IgM serological titres), and 13 classified as RVF negative. Goats, sheep, and cattle in the area have shown evidence of zoonotic hemorrhagic illness, and abortions in livestock, disease in cattle, and wild bird die-offs have been reported.

Public Health Actions
- In light of the confirmation of additional animal cases, a joint Ministry of Health and Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries press briefing is scheduled for 12 Mar 2018 to formally declare the outbreak in Yirol East county.
- Investigation and response activities continue to be coordinated by a multi-sectoral task force that meets weekly at the national and sub-national (Yirol East) level.
- On 6 Mar 2018, a high-level delegation led by the Minister of Health with participation of officials from the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries, WHO, and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) visited Yirol East. The delegation was briefed on the outbreak and status of prevention and response activities in Yirol East and other counties at risk.
- State rapid response teams continue to investigate all new suspected RVF cases and are supporting the collection of samples to enable confirmatory laboratory testing.
- Surveillance for human and animal cases by community health workers and community animal health workers is ongoing.
- Community mobilization, engagement, and sensitization activities are ongoing in Yirol East, Yirol West, and Awerial counties with support from the Yirol East county health department, the Eastern Lakes State Ministry of Health, UNICEF, and Community Health and Development Organization (CHADO).
- The development of a multi-sectoral RVF preparedness and response framework is ongoing.

Situation Interpretation
The RVF outbreak in South Sudan continues to evolve, and the detection of suspected cases in a Yirol West county and confirmation of additional animal cases underscores the need to strengthen RVF preparedness, surveillance, and response capacity in human and animal populations at risk. Support from the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries, in collaboration with WHO, FAO, and partners will be needed to implement the necessary One Health interventions aimed at containing the disease in livestock and reducing the risk of animal to human RVF transmission. Extended human and animal health and entomological investigations into the event, and the nationalization of the multi-sectoral RVF preparedness and response framework are urgently needed to guide activities in this area. Technical support for the development of a long term RVF risk communication strategy is also needed, as such a strategy is a key component in reducing the risk of human RVF cases in this population.

[It is now clearly established that there is a Rift Valley fever outbreak in Eastern Lakes state involving both humans and livestock. The appearance of a new case in a different county (Yirol West) is unsettling. Addressing a new locality will complicate the surveillance and logistics of dealing with this outbreak. This outbreak now involves people and a variety of domestic animals. Fortunately, help is being provided to deal with this outbreak. A team of volunteers is working in close collaboration with the active case search team to engage the community and conduct risk communication. An understanding of the risks of handling infected animals is essential in avoiding more human cases, as is the avoidance of mosquito bites. A vaccine is available for animals, although there is no mention of animal vaccination in this or previous reports. - Mod.TY
