[1] CCHF - Russia (Stavrapol Krai)

The 2nd fatal case of tick-borne Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever
(CCHF) has been registered in Stavrapol Krai. According to the report
of the regional Rospotrebnadzor [Federal Trade and Public Health
Inspection Authority], "a 39-year-old woman has died in the
hospital." The 1st fatal case was a man who died in the middle of May
2008.

The level of CCHF morbidity is now higher than for the same period of
2007 by 1.7 times. As of 26 May 2008, 17 patients have been
registered in 12 regions, mainly rated as moderate to severe cases. A
total of 3305 people applied for medical care because of tick-bites.
The highest level of tick activity and, accordingly, human morbidity
is expected during May and June 2008. In all, 133 people from 25
territories have been admitted to hospital, which is 70 percent more
than during the past year [2008].

The regional administration of Rospotrebnadzor stated that the
specialist staff of the Centre of Hygiene and Epidemiology examined a
total of 4000 ticks and virus found in ticks from the
Aapanasenkovskoe and Turkmenskoe regions. In order to control the
spread of the disease, anti-tick treatments of farm animals were
carried out in combination with cattle and pasture management
activities. Several educational campaigns have been organized for the
local population.

[2] CCHF - Russia (Kalmykia)

The Interfax News Agency has reported that an 11-year-old girl
contracted Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) following a tick
bite and died subsequently. The diagnosis was established only after
the worsening of the girl's condition. The parents of the girl sought
medical treatment for her in the local health clinic, but the tick
bite was not detected immediately.

[According to Internet sources, 4 fatal cases of CCHF have been
registered in the South Federal Okrug so far this season (2008). This
is equal to the mortality rate for CCHF for the whole of 2007.
Morbidity has increased 1.7-fold in comparison to 2007. Tick control
activities have much room for improvement as before. The low level of
awareness of CCHF among physicians despite increasing levels of
morbidity is surprising. The low ranking of CCHF in differential
diagnosis has contributed to the death of the child in Kalmykia and
the woman in Stavrapol. In some situations where there is no history
of tick bite, physicians need to be more aware of the possibility of
CCHF in assessing clinical features. - Mod.NP]
