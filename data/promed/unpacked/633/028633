Trichinellosis in Belgium from imported wild boar
-------------------------------------------------
At least 9 persons in the province of Limburg [Belgium] are suffering from an infection due to _Trichinella spiralis_ after eating boar meat -- probably imported from Spain -- in the previous month [November-December 2014]. Other cases from other provinces will probably be detected in the near future since Belgian authorities warned the public in a radio message.

Trichinosis is a virtually unknown disease in Belgium since it disappeared some 100 years ago.

[_Trichinella_ spp. can survive in dried and cured meat, and infections for instance by salami manufactured in one country and consumed in another country is not unusual. - Mod.EP

Information on the origin of the implicated source of tainted boar meat would be greatly appreciated (where in Spain, was this a 'commercial' product or artesanal?). - Mod.MPP
