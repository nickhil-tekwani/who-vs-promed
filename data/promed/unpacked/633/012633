East African trypanosomiasis has been confirmed in an expatriate wildlife researcher working in the Vwaza Marsh Game Reserve, Malawi. The patient presented with an acute febrile illness and a typical chancre. A scanty parasitaemia was noted. The patient is being treated with suramin in a Johannesburg hospital. This is the 2nd case admitted here in the past week with infection acquired in Vwaza Marsh Game Reserve.

The ProMED commentaries about recent cases have suggested that trypanosomiasis is endemic in all southern African game reserves, which is not accurate. The most southern extent of trypanosomiasis is the Zambezi River valley, between Zambia and Zimbabwe. East African trypanosomiasis patients evacuated to Johannesburg in 2018 and 2019 acquired the infection in Malawi, Uganda, and Zambia.
