Wildlife rabies vaccine infects woman
--------------------------------
In what health officials say is the first documented case of its kind, a
pregnant woman from northeastern Ohio was infected by a rabies vaccine used
in a wildlife bait program. The case was reported by staff from the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [and published in the New England
Journal of Medicine 2001; 345(8): 582-6
<http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/345/8/582> - Mod.SH. The 28 year
old woman became ill 3 days after being bitten by her pet dog, which had
been chomping on a chunk of rabies vaccine bait. The bait, scattered by
public health officials to prevent the spread of rabies in wild animals,
contained a genetically modified oral vaccine called vaccinia-rabies
glycoprotein virus.
The woman developed fever, swelling of the arm [with blistering, and
inflamed red skin. She was given antibiotics and had the infected wound
surgically drained. She suffered no [long term adverse effects, the
researchers say, and there was also no effect on her unborn child.
The incident happened last September [2000. The woman had been pulling the
bait out of her dog's mouth when the animal bit her finger and grazed her
arm, says Dr Charles Rupprecht, chief of CDC's rabies section and author of
the case report in the Aug 23 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.
"She thoroughly washed her bitten finger, but where the dog grazed her arm,
she probably did not pay as much attention," he says. "And that's where the
virus impregnated the skin. And so we have the first documented infection
with this recombinant virus."
Rupprecht says the dog must have punctured the packet of vaccine hidden
within the bait. "The vaccine is enclosed in something like a ketchup
packet within the bait, which looks like a charcoal briquette. It uses a
polymer, which binds together fish meal and fish oils attractive to
raccoons. Most carnivores, in fact, are attracted to the bait," he notes.
The genetically modified virus was developed in the 1980s as a way to
orally inoculate raccoons and foxes against rabies. It was used
successfully in Europe before it was field-tested in the United States in
1990. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the rabies vaccine
bait in 1995, and since then planes have dropped tens of millions of these
packets in wildlife areas throughout the eastern half of the United States.
Dr Michael Auslander, public health veterinarian for the state of Kentucky,
says the case is an anomaly. "We've had extensive experience with this
bait, and this is the first known case of transmission from vaccinia," he
notes. "Handling the bait has always been safe, and it's been going on for
10 years in Texas, which has the most experience." Auslander says the bait
is "used where there are naturally occurring epidemics of rabies in foxes
and raccoons. These animals can pass rabies on to cattle and dogs, and
that's what we are trying to avoid -- the spread of the disease from
wildlife to domesticated animals or to people."
In 1999, there were 7067 reported cases of rabies in animals in the United
States, 11 per cent less than in 1998. Rabies in raccoons was virtually
unheard of before the 1950s, but has spread since the 1970s. Last year, 5
Americans died of rabies; 4 of them came into contact with bats and the
fifth was bitten by a dog while travelling in Africa. The case study
presents "sort of a mixed message," Rupprecht says. "It shows the relative
safety of this vaccination approach, since this is the first case [of
infection we've been able to document in 10 years. And remember [the use
of these baits has been going on in Europe since 1986, where it helped to
eliminate rabies in foxes in France."The mixed part of the message is that
every year we've been putting out more and more doses in more geographic
areas as part of a national plan," Rupprecht continues. "And we have data
showing that the vaccine bait is controlling rabies." The report, for
instance, says that no rabies cases were found among raccoons in 2000.
Rupprecht says that when public health officials scatter the bait, every
effort is made to alert the public. "It's usually accompanied by a whole
media campaign -- press, radio, letters to public health officials and
veterinarians. But we've been doing it for 10 years, and the news starts to
become old hat."
"We don't want to become cavalier, and we want to remember the things we
learned in childhood, such as washing all animal bites with soap and
water," Rupprecht advises. "And contacting our primary care provider, if
illness results."

[The above report begs questions about the nature of the woman's infection,
which are answered in the New England Journal of Medicine report. Swabs,
serum, and eschar from the woman, and both placenta and umbilical cord
serum were examined. Electron microscopy revealed the morphological
features of orthopoxviruses, polymerase chain reaction yielded products 100
per cent homologous with those expected for vaccinia-rabies glycoprotein
virus in all samples apart from placenta, and serological tests identfied
high titers of antibodies against both vaccinia and rabies. The authors
note that "the vaccinia-rabies glycoprotein virus is a self-replicating
agent... ...and may cause adverse events, particularly in hosts with
altered immunocompetence and in persons for whom smallpox vaccination is
contraindicated, such as pregnant women or patients with an exfoliative
skin condition". - Mod.SH
