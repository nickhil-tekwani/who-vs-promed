Brazil
- Origin and spread. 15 Jun 2017. (reported) Analyses of viral genomes with ecological and epidemiological data yield an estimate that ZIKV was present in northeast Brazil by February 2014 and is likely to have disseminated from there, nationally and internationally, before the 1st detection of ZIKV in the Americas. Estimated dates for the international spread of ZIKV from Brazil indicate the duration of pre-detection cryptic transmission in recipient regions. The role of northeast Brazil in the establishment of ZIKV in the Americas is further supported by geographic analysis of ZIKV transmission.

- Eye lesions. 17 Jul 2017 (reported) of 112 infants born to Zika virus infected mothers in Brazil, 24 (21 percent) had eye abnormalities; 10 infants (42 percent) with abnormal eye examination findings did not have microcephaly, 8 (33 percent) did not have any central nervous system findings, and 2 (8 percent) had eye abnormalities despite maternal 3rd trimester infection. Eye abnormalities may be the only initial finding in congenital Zika virus infection, and all infants with potential Zika virus exposure should undergo screening eye examinations. http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/2636587

- Texas. 11 Aug 2017. 1 Jan 2016-31 July 2017, 219 pregnant women with laboratory evidence of possible recent Zika virus infection were identified in Texas, including 49 (22 percent) with laboratory-confirmed Zika virus). One woman was infected in Texas; all others were exposed outside the United States and its territories. Zika virus testing was completed for 80 (43 percent) of the 185 infants or fetuses, and Zika virus-associated birth defects were documented in 15 (8 percent) pregnancies (14 live-born infants and one fetal loss), including 6 (17 percent) of the 36 infants or fetal losses delivered by women with laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection. Of these, 10 infants or fetuses had microcephaly; 5 of those with microcephaly had additional birth defects, including holoprosencephaly [the brain doesn't properly divide into the right and left hemispheres], hydranencephaly [brain's cerebral hemispheres replaced by sacs filled with cerebrospinal fluid], craniosynostosis [premature fusion of one or more cranial sutures, often resulting in an abnormal head shape], and clubfeet [feet turned inward]. Zika virus-associated birth defects identified in the remaining 3 infants included holoprosencephaly, cataracts, and ventral pons hypoplasia.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Because of global spread of Zika virus, accurate and high-throughput diagnostic immunoassays are needed. We compared the sensitivity and specificity of 5 commercially available Zika virus serologic assays to the recommended protocol of Zika virus IgM-capture ELISA and plaque-reduction neutralization tests. Most commercial immunoassays showed low sensitivity, which can be increased.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Zika virus is present in urine, saliva, tears, and breast milk, but the transmission risk associated with these body fluids is currently unknown. Here we evaluate the risk of Zika virus transmission through mucosal contact in rhesus macaques. Application of high-dose Zika virus directly to the tonsils of 3 rhesus macaques results in detectable plasma viremia in all animals by 2 days post-exposure; virus replication kinetics are similar to those observed in animals infected subcutaneously. 3 additional macaques inoculated subcutaneously with Zika virus served as saliva donors to assess the transmission risk from contact with oral secretions from an infected individual. 7 naive animals repeatedly exposed to donor saliva via the conjunctivae, tonsils, or nostrils did not become infected. Our results suggest that there is a risk of Zika virus transmission via the mucosal route, but that the risk posed by oral secretions from individuals with a typical course of Zika virus infection is low.

[4] CDC guidance for pregnancy
Date: Mon 24 Jul 2017
Source: CDC. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2017; 66(29): 781-93[edited]
https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6629e1.htm


ref: Oduyebo T, Polen KD, Walke HT, et al. Update: Interim guidance for health care providers caring for pregnant women with possible Zika virus exposure -- United States (including US Territories), July 2017. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2017; 66(29): 781-93. doi: 10.15585/mmwr.mm6629e1
----------------------------------------------------------------------
CDC has updated the interim guidance for US health care providers caring for pregnant women with possible Zika virus exposure in response to 1) declining prevalence of Zika virus disease in the World Health Organization's Region of the Americas (Americas) and 2) emerging evidence indicating prolonged detection of Zika virus immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies. Zika virus cases were 1st reported in the Americas during 2015-2016; however, the incidence of Zika virus disease has since declined. As the prevalence of Zika virus disease declines, the likelihood of false-positive test results increases. In addition, emerging epidemiologic and laboratory data indicate that, as is the case with other flaviviruses, Zika virus IgM antibodies can persist beyond 12 weeks after infection. Therefore, IgM test results cannot always reliably distinguish between an infection that occurred during the current pregnancy and one that occurred before the current pregnancy, particularly for women with possible Zika virus exposure before the current pregnancy. These limitations should be considered when counseling pregnant women about the risks and benefits of testing for Zika virus infection during pregnancy. This updated guidance emphasizes a shared decision-making model for testing and screening pregnant women, one in which patients and providers work together to make decisions about testing and care plans based on patient preferences and values, clinical judgment, and a balanced assessment of risks and expected outcomes.

For these recommendations, the definition of possible Zika virus exposure has not changed and includes travel to, or residence in an area with risk for mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission or sex with a partner who has traveled to or resides in an area with risk for mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission. These areas can be found on the CDC "Zika Travel Information" webpage.

Key recommendations include the following:
1- All pregnant women in the United States and US territories should be asked about possible Zika virus exposure before and during the current pregnancy, at every prenatal care visit. CDC recommends that pregnant women not travel to any area with risk for Zika virus transmission. It is also recommended that pregnant women with a sex partner who has traveled to or lives in an area with risk for Zika virus transmission use condoms or abstain from sex for the duration of the pregnancy.
2- Pregnant women with recent possible Zika virus exposure and symptoms of Zika virus disease should be tested to diagnose the cause of their symptoms. The updated recommendations include concurrent Zika virus nucleic acid test (NAT) and serologic testing as soon as possible through 12 weeks after symptom onset.
3- Asymptomatic pregnant women with ongoing possible Zika virus exposure should be offered Zika virus NAT testing 3 times during pregnancy. IgM testing is no longer routinely recommended because IgM can persist for months after infection; therefore, IgM results cannot reliably determine whether an infection occurred during the current pregnancy. The optimal timing and frequency of testing of asymptomatic pregnant women with NAT alone is unknown. For pregnant women who have received a diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection (by either NAT or serology [positive/equivocal Zika virus or dengue virus IgM and Zika virus plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) 10 and higher and dengue virus PRNT less than 10 results]) any time before or during the current pregnancy, additional Zika virus testing is not recommended. For pregnant women without a prior laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of Zika virus, NAT testing should be offered at the initiation of prenatal care, and if Zika virus RNA is not detected on clinical specimens, 2 additional tests should be offered during the course of the pregnancy coinciding with prenatal visits.
4- Asymptomatic pregnant women who have recent possible Zika virus exposure (that is, through travel or sexual exposure) but without ongoing possible exposure are not routinely recommended to have Zika virus testing. Testing should be considered using a shared patient-provider decision-making model, one in which patients and providers work together to make decisions about testing and care plans based on patient preferences and values, clinical judgment, a balanced assessment of risks and expected outcomes, and the jurisdiction's recommendations. Based on the epidemiology of Zika virus transmission and other epidemiologic considerations (such as, seasonality), jurisdictions might recommend testing of asymptomatic pregnant women, either for clinical care or as part of Zika virus surveillance. With the decline in the prevalence of Zika virus disease, the updated recommendations for the evaluation and testing of pregnant women with recent possible Zika virus exposure but without ongoing possible exposure are now the same for all areas with any risk for Zika virus transmission.
5- Pregnant women who have recent possible Zika virus exposure and who have a fetus with prenatal ultrasound findings consistent with congenital Zika virus syndrome should receive Zika virus testing to assist in establishing the etiology of the birth defects. Testing should include both NAT and IgM tests.
6- The comprehensive approach to testing placental and fetal tissues has been updated. Testing placental and fetal tissue specimens can be performed for diagnostic purposes in certain scenarios (e.g., women without a diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection and who have a fetus or infant with possible Zika virus-associated birth defects). However, testing of placental tissues for Zika virus infection is not routinely recommended for asymptomatic pregnant women who have recent possible Zika virus exposure but without ongoing possible exposure and who have a live born infant without evidence of possible Zika virus-associated birth defects.
7- Zika virus IgM testing as part of preconception counseling to establish baseline IgM results for non pregnant women with ongoing possible Zika virus exposure is not warranted because Zika virus IgM testing is no longer routinely recommended for asymptomatic pregnant women with ongoing possible Zika virus exposure.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Key points
----------
Question. What is the spectrum of neurologic manifestations in adults with Zika virus infection?
Findings. This cohort study evaluated adult patients with new-onset parainfectious or neuroinflammatory disease for the presence of acute Zika virus infection in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples using molecular and serological testing. An increase in the incidence of Guillain-Barré syndrome and encephalitis was observed compared with the period before the outbreak of the Zika virus.
Meaning The Zika virus may be associated with a rapid increase in the incidence of life-threatening neurologic syndromes; serologic and molecular testing using blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples can serve as an alternative diagnostic strategy.

Abstract
--------
Importance. There are no prospective cohort studies assessing the incidence and spectrum of neurologic manifestations secondary to Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in adults.
Objective. To evaluate the rates of acute ZIKV infection among patients hospitalized with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), meningoencephalitis, or transverse myelitis.
Design, setting, and participants. A prospective, observational cohort study was conducted at a tertiary referral center for neurological diseases in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, between 5 Dec 2015-10 May 2016, among consecutive hospitalized adults (older than 18 years of age) with new-onset acute parainfectious or neuroinflammatory disease. All participants were tested for a series of arbovirosis. 3-month functional outcome was assessed.
Interventions. Samples of serum and cerebrospinal fluid were tested for ZIKV using real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and an IgM antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Clinical, radiographic (magnetic resonance imaging), electrophysiological, and 3-month functional outcome data were collected.
Main outcomes and measures. The detection of neurologic complications secondary to ZIKV infection.
Results. 40 patients (15 women and 25 men; median age, 44 years [range, 22-72 years]) were enrolled, including 29 patients (73 percent) with GBS (90 percent Brighton level 1 certainty), 7 (18 percent) with encephalitis, 3 (8 percent) with transverse myelitis, and 1 (3 percent) with newly diagnosed chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. Of these, 35 patients (88 percent) had molecular and/or serologic evidence of recent ZIKV infection in the serum and/or cerebrospinal fluid. Of the patients positive for ZIKV infection, 27 had GBS (18 demyelinating, 8 axonal, and 1 Miller Fisher syndrome), 5 had encephalitis (3 with concomitant acute neuromuscular disease), 2 had transverse myelitis, and 1 had chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. Admission to the intensive care unit was required for 9 patients positive for ZIKV infection (26 percent), and 5 (14 percent) required mechanical ventilation. Compared with admission during the period from 5 Dec 2013 - 10 May 2014 (before the Brazilian outbreak of ZIKV), admissions for GBS increased from a mean of 1.0 per month to 5.6 per month, admissions for encephalitis increased from 0.4 per month to 1.4 per month, and admissions for transverse myelitis remained constant at 0.6 per month. At 3 months, 2 patients positive for ZIKV infection (6 percent) died (1 with GBS and 1 with encephalitis), 18 (51 percent) had chronic pain, and the median modified Rankin score among survivors was 2 (range, 0-5).
Conclusions and relevance. In this single-center Brazilian cohort, ZIKV infection was associated with an increase in the incidence of a diverse spectrum of serious neurologic syndromes. The data also suggest that serologic and molecular testing using blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples can serve as a less expensive, alternative diagnostic strategy in developing countries, where plaque reduction neutralization testing is impractical.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
ZIKV persists in patients, crossing placental and neuronal barriers, damaging neurons, and causing fetal microencephaly. We found that ZIKV persistently infects brain endothelial cells that normally protect neurons from viral exposure. hBMECs are not damaged by ZIKV infection and, analogous to persistent HCV infection, ZIKV constitutively induces and evades antiviral ISG [IFN-stimulated genes] and IFN [interferon] responses to continuously replicate in hBMECs. As a result, hBMECs provide a protective niche for systemic ZIKV spread and a viral reservoir localized in the normally protective blood-brain barrier. Consistent with the spread of ZIKV into neuronal compartments, ZIKV was released basolaterally from hBMECs. Our findings define hBMEC responses that contribute to persistent ZIKV infection and potential targets for clearing ZIKV infections from hBMECs. These results further suggest roles for additional ZIKV-infected ECs to facilitate viral spread and persistence in the protected placental, retinal, and testicular compartments.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Studies have demonstrated cross-reactivity of anti-dengue virus (DENV) antibodies in human sera against Zika virus (ZIKV), promoting increased ZIKV infection in vitro. However, the correlation between in vitro and in vivo findings is not well characterized. Thus, we evaluated the impact of heterotypic flavivirus immunity on ZIKV titers in biofluids of rhesus macaques. Animals previously infected (420 days or longer) with DENV2, DENV4, or yellow fever virus were compared to flavivirus-naïve animals following infection with a Brazilian ZIKV strain. Sera from DENV-immune macaques demonstrated cross-reactivity with ZIKV by antibody-binding and neutralization assays prior to ZIKV infection, and promoted increased ZIKV infection in cell culture assays. Despite these findings, no significant differences between flavivirus-naïve and immune animals were observed in viral titers, neutralizing antibody levels, or immune cell kinetics following ZIKV infection. These results indicate that prior infection with heterologous flaviviruses neither conferred protection nor increased observed ZIKV titers in this non-human primate ZIKV infection model.

Author summary
--------------
Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne, emerging flavivirus. In addition to asymptomatic or mild febrile manifestations, ZIKV infection in humans is associated with comparatively rare congenital and neurological abnormalities. Previous in vitro studies have demonstrated cross-reactivity of antibodies derived from dengue virus infections with ZIKV, as well as antibody-mediated enhancement of infection in cell culture. Therefore, there is concern among vaccinologists and the public health community that the more severe disease manifestations could result from prior immunity, either from natural infection or vaccination, to antigenically-related flaviviruses (such as, dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis). In this study, we evaluated the impact of prior immunity to dengue or yellow fever virus on ZIKV infection in a non-human primate model. After confirming that our immune cohorts were capable of recapitulating the published in vitro observations of cross-reactivity and enhancement, we looked for alteration of viral titers in peripheral blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, and vaginal secretions, as well as alterations in gross pathology, clinical parameters, and immune response, as compared to our flavivirus-naïve cohort. Importantly, no significant differences between flavivirus-naïve and primed animals were observed in viral titers or biofluid distribution, neutralizing antibody levels, or immune cell kinetics following ZIKV infection.

[Previous dengue infection, whether acquired naturally or antibody elicited by vaccines, has been a concern due to the possibility of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) with more severe disease. This concern also relates to Zika virus antibody from vaccination for enhancement of dengue virus infections with resulting more severe disease. The monkey studies reported above indicated that this may not be a problem for Zika virus vaccinated individuals. Another effort to avoid ADE is development of a vaccine that has epitopes specific for Zika virus that are not shared by other flaviviruses. A group of researchers developed a recombinant vaccine targeting a viral envelope sub-unit specific to the Zika virus (http://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/news-and-analysis/news-in-brief/researchers-find-way-to-overcome-zika-vaccinedengue-virus-conundrum/20203379.article).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Zika virus (ZIKV), a re-emerging flavivirus associated with neurological disorders, has spread rapidly to more than 70 countries and territories. However, no specific vaccines or antiviral drugs are currently available to prevent or treat ZIKV infection. Here we report that a synthetic peptide derived from the stem region of ZIKV envelope protein, designated Z2, potently inhibits infection of ZIKV and other flaviviruses in vitro. We show that Z2 interacts with ZIKV surface protein and disrupts the integrity of the viral membrane. Z2 can penetrate the placental barrier to enter fetal tissues and is safe for use in pregnant mice. Intraperitoneal administration of Z2 inhibits vertical transmission of ZIKV in pregnant C57BL/6 mice and protects type I or type I/II interferon receptor-deficient mice against lethal ZIKV challenge. Thus, Z2 has potential to be further developed as an antiviral treatment against ZIKV infection in high-risk populations, particularly pregnant women.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted virus that can cause severe defects in an infected fetus. ZIKV is also transmitted by sexual contact, although the relative importance of sexual transmission is unclear. To better understand the role of sexual transmission in ZIKV pathogenesis, a nonhuman primate (NHP) model of vaginal transmission was developed. ZIKV was readily transmitted to mature cycling female rhesus macaque (RM) by vaginal inoculation was readily transmitted to mature cycling female rhesus macaque (RM) by vaginal individual RM with 1-5 vaginal inoculations required to establish infection. After treatment with Depoprovera, a widely used contraceptive progestin, 2 RM that initially resisted 8 vaginal ZIKV inoculations became infected after one ZIKV inoculation. Thus, Depoprovera seemed to enhance susceptibility to vaginal ZIKV transmission. Unexpectedly, the kinetics of virus replication and dissemination after intravaginal ZIKV inoculation were markedly different from RM infected with ZIKV by subcutaneous (SQ) virus inoculation. Several groups have reported that after SQ ZIKV inoculation vRNA is rapidly detected in blood plasma with vRNA less common in urine and saliva and only rarely detected in female reproductive tract (FRT) secretions. In contrast, in vaginally inoculated RM, plasma vRNA is delayed for several days and ZIKV replication in, and vRNA shedding from, the FRT was found in all 6 animals. Further, after intravaginal transmission ZIKV RNA shedding from FRT secretions was detected before or simultaneously with plasma vRNA, and persisted for at least as long. Thus, ZIKV replication in the FRT was independent of, and often preceded virus replication in the tissues contributing to plasma vRNA. These results support the conclusion that ZIKV preferentially replicates in the FRT after vaginal transmission, but not after SQ transmission, and raise the possibility that there is enhanced fetal infection and pathology after vaginal ZIKV transmission compared to a mosquito transmitted ZIKV.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
To evaluate the potential role of _Aedes albopictus_ (Skuse) as a vector of Zika virus (ZIKV), colonized mosquitoes of low generation number (less than or F5) from Brazil, Houston, and the Rio Grande Valley of Texas engorged on viremic mice infected with ZIKV strains originating from Senegal, Cambodia, Mexico, Brazil, or Puerto Rico. Vector competence was established by monitoring infection, dissemination, and transmission potential after 3, 7, and 14 days of extrinsic incubation. Positive saliva samples were assayed for infectious titer. Although all 3 mosquito populations were susceptible to all ZIKV strains, rates of infection, dissemination, and transmission differed among mosquito and virus strains. _Aedes albopictus_ from Salvador, Brazil, were the least efficient vectors, demonstrating susceptibility to infection to 2 American strains of ZIKV but failing to shed virus in saliva. Mosquitoes from the Rio Grande Valley were the most efficient vectors and were capable of shedding all 3 tested ZIKV strains into saliva after 14 days of extrinsic incubation. In particular, ZIKV strain DakAR 41525 (Senegal 1954) was significantly more efficient at dissemination and saliva deposition than the others tested in Rio Grande mosquitoes. Overall, our data indicate that, while _Ae. albopictus_ is capable of transmitting ZIKV, its competence is potentially dependent on geographic origin of both the mosquito population and the viral strain.

[This study illustrates that fact that not all Zika virus strains and _Ae. albopictus_ populations are created equal in terms of efficiency of transmission of this virus. Although some populations of this mosquito are able to efficiently transmits some Zika viruses, the fact that _Ae. albopictus _ are not strictly human biters, further reduces their role as transmitters of this virus to people. - Mod.TY]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that has recently been associated with an increased incidence of neonatal microcephaly and other neurological disorders. The virus is primarily transmitted by mosquito bite, although other routes of infection have been implicated in some cases. The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito is considered to be the main vector to humans worldwide; however, there is evidence that other mosquito species, including _Culex quinquefasciatus_, transmit the virus. To test the potential of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ to transmit ZIKV, we experimentally compared the vector competence of laboratory-reared _Ae. aegypti_ and _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. Interestingly, we were able to detect the presence of ZIKV in the midgut, salivary glands and saliva of artificially fed _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. In addition, we collected ZIKV-infected _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ from urban areas with high microcephaly incidence in Recife, Brazil. Corroborating our experimental data from artificially fed mosquitoes, ZIKV was isolated from field-caught _Cx. quinquefasciatus_, and its genome was partially sequenced. Collectively, these findings indicate that there may be a wider range of ZIKV vectors than anticipated.

[Finding a virus in field-collected mosquitoes in areas of active virus transmission is highly suggestive, but not conclusive, of their ability to transmit that virus. The study above goes the next step toward proving vector capability by infecting _Culex quinquefasciatus_ fed with Zika virus and subsequently demonstrating the virus in saliva, implicating their ability to transmit it. The role of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ in Zika virus transmission is currently confusing. The study above and one done in China indicate that this species is a competent vector. Several other studies have shown this species to be inefficient vectors or refractory to Zika virus infection. One wonders if the specific _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ used or the Zika virus isolates with which they were tested could account for these very different results. Resolving these discrepancies is important because this mosquito species is very widely distributed around the world and bears directly on risk of outbreaks in geographic areas where _Aedes aegypti_ or _Ae. albopictus_ , Zika virus vectors, do not occur. - Mod.TY]
