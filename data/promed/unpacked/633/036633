Measles outbreaks across Europe show no sign of slowing
-------------------------------------------------------
Countries in the WHO European Region continue to battle large measles
outbreaks that are spreading between countries and to other regions of
the world. To date, 24 countries in Region have reported measles cases
in 2011.

Outbreak in France exported to other countries
----------------------------------------------
France has experienced the largest outbreak, with 3749 measles cases
officially reported in January and February 2011 -- 8 people have
suffered neurological complications and one person has died due to
measles-related pneumonia. The national immunization system is
implementing measures to get children vaccinated during the outbreak,
including vaccinating infants at 9 months of age, in line with WHO
recommendations for a measles outbreak, and offering vaccine to all
unimmunized and under-immunized people over the age of 9 months.

In 2011, epidemiological investigations and genotyping by
laboratories confirm that the measles virus has been exported from
France to Denmark, Germany, Italy, Romania, the Russian Federation
and, most recently, to Belgium. The national surveillance system in
Belgium has reported 100 cases of measles so far in 2011. In the hot
spot of this outbreak, Ghent, the virus is affecting primarily
children younger than one year (and therefore unimmunized) and
students of anthroposophic schools (unimmunized due to philosophical
beliefs).

Outbreaks throughout the European Region
----------------------------------------
A measles outbreak is also ongoing in Andalusia, Spain, with more
than 400 cases reported during the 1st 2 months of 2011. Regular
updates on outbreaks from Serbia, Turkey, and the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia confirm that the disease continues to spread,
and this emphasizes the need to strengthen responses in order to
control these outbreaks.

WHO/Europe urges Member States to act now
-----------------------------------------
Measles virus spreads very easily and rapidly, and consequently these
outbreaks will likely continue as long as there are people who have
not been immunized or were not immunized on time, according to the
routine immunization schedule. Measles remains one of the leading
causes of death among young children globally, despite the
availability of a safe and effective vaccine.

At the September 2010 session of the WHO Regional Committee for
Europe, Member States unanimously adopted a resolution to renew their
commitment and accelerate actions to eliminate measles and rubella in
the European Region by 2015. It is crucially important that Member
States and WHO/Europe act now on this commitment, in order to stop
costly and deadly outbreaks.

WHO urges countries to remain vigilant and to implement timely
prevention and control measures, in order to halt the spread of
measles within their own borders and prevent measles being exported to
other countries -- especially those where measles can be extremely
deadly, such as in Africa and south east Asia.

To prevent further exportation and importation of measles, both
inside and outside the Region, WHO/Europe encourages health
authorities of Member States to advocate for immunization before
international travel and to make vaccinations available to
travellers.

WHO/Europe reminds Member States to ensure timely case investigation,
including sample collection, and to report all measles cases to
WHO/Europe.

European Immunization Week
--------------------------
The annual European Immunization Week (EIW), taking place this year
from 23 to 30 Apr 2011, gives communities, health workers,
decision-makers, and the broad range of stakeholders and partners an
opportunity to promote immunization within their country.

Nosocomial transmission of measles among healthcare workers,
Bulgaria, 2010
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[Authors: Komitova R 1, Kunchev A 2, Mihneva Z 3, Marinova L 3
1. University Hospital, Plovdiv, Bulgaria
2. Communicable Diseases Surveillance Department, Ministry of Health,
Sofia, Bulgaria
3. National Centre of Infectious and Parasitic Diseases, Sofia,
Bulgaria]

This report describes 326 cases of nosocomial transmission of measles
with 286 cases among non-healthcare workers who acquired the disease
in a hospital setting. Between October 2009 and April 2010, 40
healthcare workers from 7 different regions in Bulgaria have
contracted the disease. Measles is a potentially severe highly
contagious disease. However, at least 98 per cent of those receiving 2
doses of measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR) are protected against the
disease. Preliminary reports for 2010 show that there were more than
30 000 measles cases in the Member States of the European Union (EU) /
European Economic Area (EEA) -- the highest number of measles reported
in Europe in more than 10 years (1). The highest number of cases was
reported in Bulgaria, followed by France, Italy, and Germany (1).
Measles continues to spread in 2011 with more than 4000 cases reported
in the EU/EEA in January and February (1).

Outbreak overview
-----------------
The current outbreak in Bulgaria started in March 2009 following an
imported case of measles from Germany (2). It has been the largest
outbreak ever reported in Bulgaria since the large outbreak which
occurred in 1976, only a few years after the immunisation schedule
with one dose of monovalent measles-containing vaccine starting with
the age of 10 months had been implemented in the country. The 2nd dose
was introduced at 4 years of age in 1982. In 1993 the 1st dose of
monovalent measles-containing vaccine was replaced by the MMR vaccine.
Since 2001 the 2-dose measles immunisation with MMR vaccine has been
introduced with the 1st dose at 13 months and the 2nd at 12 years of
age (3).

In this outbreak, the total number of cases reached 24 253 during the
2-year period, reached its peak in March 2010 and started gradually to
subside in late summer [unpublished data]. Only a few cases were
reported every week in September and October 2010 (3). However,
according to preliminary results, about 130 cases were notified in the
1st 3 months of 2011, some of them diagnosed in late December 2010 but
notified in January 2011. This calls into question whether it is at
all possible to control such a contagious disease in a short time and
in the presence of many pockets of susceptible individuals.

Of the 24 137 cases with full epidemiological and clinical data
available, 3917 (16.2 per cent) were laboratory-confirmed (measles
IgM), 7944 (32.9 per cent) were epidemiologically linked and the
remaining 12 276 (50.9 per cent) were probable cases. The highest
incidence rate was observed in children under one year of age (n=4717;
6/100 000 population) who were not eligible for MMR vaccination.
Despite the ongoing outbreak, the Bulgarian health authority did not
change the recommendation regarding MMR vaccination, that is, did not
recommend that the 1st dose be given earlier, at the age of 9 months.
Of the 24 047 cases investigated, 89.3 per cent belonged to the Roma
ethnic community. The majority (86.8 per cent) were hospitalised,
mainly due to epidemiological considerations -- patients from
overcrowded households with poor living conditions and inadequate
access to medical care. 24 deaths were reported but no information on
complications is available at the moment (4).

Transmission in medical settings
--------------------------------
Transmission in medical settings was reported for 326 cases and the
hospital was the most frequently reported setting. Of these 326 cases,
286 were not healthcare workers and acquired measles in hospital or
primary care.

By April 2010, 40 healthcare workers (HCWs) (0.16 per cent of all
measles cases) in 7 different regions in Bulgaria have contracted the
disease. Most of them occurred during the peak of the outbreak, in
March 2010. The measles case definition in Bulgaria is based on the EU
case definition (5). 23 cases were classified as confirmed (presence
of measles-specific IgM antibodies) and 17 as probable (not tested).
Laboratory tests of all but 2 were performed at the National Reference
laboratory of measles, mumps, and rubella in Sofia. 34 cases occurred
in hospitals and 6 in primary care.

The mean age of the cases among HCWs was 38 years (range 24-48 years)
and 28 of them were women. The largest group of measles cases among
HCWs were physicians (n=19), followed by laboratory technicians (n=8),
nurses (n=7), cleaning staff (n=4), and pharmacists (n=2). All but one
are likely to have acquired the infection from patients and one
physician from a colleague. 10 HCWs developed radiologically proven
pneumonia and all recovered. 15 HCWs were hospitalised due to
dehydration or pneumonia.

According to their age, the majority of cases should have been
vaccinated with at least one dose of measles-containing vaccine, as
one dose measles immunisation was introduced in Bulgaria in 1969 and
in 1972 it became part of the immunisation schedule in the whole
country. Nevertheless, only one case had a vaccination record of 2
doses of measles-containing vaccine; the rest did not know their
vaccination status.

No secondary cases among other contact patients and family members
were reported. Information about susceptibility status or
post-exposure prophylaxis of the HCWs' contacts was not available.

Control measures
----------------
Two supplementary MMR vaccination campaigns were implemented. The 1st
one started on 27 Apr 2009 and targeted all individuals aged between
13 months and 30 years in the affected regions (Razgrad, Shumen,
Silistra, and Dobrich), who had not undergone the full vaccination
with 2 doses. Later, in order to increase the vaccine coverage, a 2nd
campaign was directed towards those older than 30 years without
documented measles vaccination (4). These measures were not very
effective maybe because they were not implemented simultaneously for
all 28 regions in Bulgaria. On the other hand, a large number of cases
might have received a supplementary vaccine dose when already infected
with measles virus. Post-exposure immunoglobulin for people at risk
for a severe form of the disease was not routinely given. The full
analysis of the outbreak is still in progress.

Discussion
----------
Measles among HCWs accounts for a relatively small proportion of the
reported cases but is important because of the potential for
transmission of the disease to susceptible colleagues (thereby
disrupting healthcare service), high-risk patients such as pregnant
women, immunocompromised individuals, and family members. They have a
nearly 19-fold higher risk of acquiring measles than the general
population (6). Transmission among HCWs was also reported in France in
2010 (7,8). The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice in the
United States of America recommends all healthcare personnel to have
presumptive evidence of immunity (positive serological test results or
written evidence of appropriate (2 doses) immunisation to mumps,
measles, and rubella or being born before 1957). For unvaccinated
persons born after 1957 who lack evidence of mumps, measles, and/or
rubella immunity or laboratory confirmation of the disease, healthcare
facilities should recommend 2 doses of MMR vaccine during an outbreak
of mumps or measles and one dose during an outbreak of rubella (9).
European countries in general should recommend measles vaccine for
HCWs who do not have documented vaccination record or history of the
disease. This outbreak highlights the need for further activities with
respect to vaccinating non-immune HCWs. Moreover, it illustrates that
a high rate of hospitalisation for measles poses a risk for nosocomial
infections that may have a detrimental effect on certain
immunocompromised or non-immune patients and HCWs. Therefore, strict
hygiene measures are important to prevent the spread in hospital
settings.

The 40 cases of measles identified in HCWs in the course of this
outbreak further highlights the need for such recommendations.
Increased vaccine uptake among HCWs of other contagious diseases like
varicella and influenza also needs to be considered in medical
settings. Maintaining a high immunisation coverage and strengthening
surveillance are essential if Europe is to meet the new elimination
target of 2015.

Study confirms measles being under-reported in Germany
------------------------------------------------------
Measles is not always being reported in Germany as required by law,
particularly when cases are sporadic. In the current edition of
Deutsches Aerzteblatt International (Dtsch Arztebl Int 2011; 108(12):
191-6 [available from
http://www.aerzteblatt.de/int/article.asp?id=81469]), Annedore
Mette's working group presents its conclusions.

WHO aims to eliminate measles in Europe by 2015. The criteria for
this are for there to be no measles cases among the country's
inhabitants, and for any measles arriving from abroad not to spread
any further within the country, as a result of the high vaccination
rate and compulsory reporting.

In their study, Annedore Mette and her coauthors analyzed and
evaluated data on measles diagnoses among individuals covered by
statutory health insurance. Their goal was to determine the ratio
between billed measles diagnoses and data gathered according to
Germany's Law on Protection Against Infectious Diseases in North
Rhine-Westphalia. The results confirmed that measles was being
underreported. Possible reasons cited by physicians when asked why
measles cases were not being reported as required by law included
forgetting, lack of habit, uncertainty about the duty to report, lack
of time, and complexity.

Geneva schools asked to alert parents as measles outbreak spreads
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Parents of children in canton Geneva schools will be asked to ensure
their children are fully vaccinated against measles, with 80 cases now
reported since January [2011]. Several of those who have become ill
were hospitalized, says cantonal public health doctor C-A Wyler
Lazarevic, who has sent a letter to schools through the Department of
Education. It should be noted that a person is only fully immunized if
he or she has had the disease or had 2 vaccinations, not just the
initial early childhood shot.

Geneva's current outbreak is an extension of the measles epidemic
that began in France in late 2010 and which is still not under
control.

Macedonia authorities declare measles epidemic
----------------------------------------------
Health authorities in Macedonia have declared an epidemic of measles
in the Balkan country and launched an emergency vaccination program.
Health minister Bujar Osmani said on Tuesday [5 Apr 2011] that the
outbreak of the contagious disease is affecting 2/3 of the country's
territory, where half of Macedonia's 2.1 million people live.

Osmani says there have been 678 reported cases, and the expanded
vaccination program is particularly targeting the most vulnerable,
including infants and the elderly. Osmani says 30 people are
hospitalized in serious condition.

Immunisation warning after measles cases in city
------------------------------------------------
Parents are being urged to get their children immunised after cases
of measles were reported in the city. NHS [National Health Service]
Nottingham City, which pays for and plans healthcare in Nottingham, is
still failing to meet its targets for the number of children aged 5
and under having the MMR vaccine -- which protects against measles,
mumps, and rubella.

Last year [2010], 83.3 per cent of children in the city had had the
MMR vaccine by their 2nd birthday -- against a target of 95 per cent.
The number of children who had received the MMR booster by their 5th
birthday was also below the 95 per cent target at 82.3 per cent.
However, the proportion of children who have been immunised in general
has been increasing.

"Vaccinations are sometimes not seen as a priority by some people,"
said Caroline Jordan, senior public health nurse for NHS Nottingham
City. "That's despite GPs' repeated phone calls and letters. Sometimes
people don't understand the importance of vaccination. Some may be
unsure what their child has had, particularly if they have come from
another country. "We do know there's some measles circulating at the
moment that further promotes the need for children to be up to date
with their vaccinations.

"Measles is a particularly infectious disease which can give
unpleasant symptoms with high temperatures, a rash, as well as aches
and pains. Miss Jordan said she believed part of the increase in the
uptake was due to GPs encouraging parents.

Measles scare for thousands of people who were on Gold Coast during
surf carnival
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Thousands of surf lifesavers could have been exposed to measles at
last week's [week of 2-10 Apr 2011] Australian championships on the
Gold Coast. Queensland Health has put out a warning to anyone who was
at the championships, the Q1 supertower or the McDonald's restaurant
at Labrador to be on alert for symptoms of the potentially deadly
disease.

Gold Coast Public Health medical officer, Dr Don Staines, said a
person who had no history of travel and was thought to have acquired
the infection somewhere on the Gold Coast. "We urge anyone who was at
Q1 or who attended the surf lifesaving carnival on Kurrawa Beach, or
visited the McDonalds restaurant in Labrador on those days, to ensure
they are protected against measles and to seek medical advice if they
develop symptoms," Dr Staines said.

Measles is one of the most infectious of all communicable diseases,
and can be acquired in public places if infectious people are present.
Measles is spread by tiny droplets through coughing and sneezing. The
virus can last for several hours in the environment. The initial
symptoms are fever, lethargy, runny nose, moist cough, and sore and
red eyes, followed a few days later by a blotchy red rash. The rash
starts on the face then becomes widespread.

Dr Staines said symptoms usually started around 10 days after
infection but sometimes longer. "Anyone who develops measles-like
symptoms within the next week or 2 should contact their GP for
advice," he said. "It's very important to call the medical practice
first to say you could have measles, so that staff can take
precautions to avoid spreading the disease to others."

Dr Staines said Queensland Health recommended anyone born during or
since 1966, who had not had 2 documented doses of measles, mumps,
rubella (MMR) vaccine or had proven measles, to visit their local GP
for a free extra vaccination. "Measles can be very distressing for
those affected, and complications can include pneumonia or
encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) and occasionally death," he
said.

Measles alert issued in Victoria
--------------------------------
A measles alert has been issued in Victoria after 4 passengers who
arrived in Melbourne on an Air Asia flight from Malaysia this month
[April 2011] were detected with the disease. The flight arrived from
Kuala Lumpur in Melbourne on the morning of 1 Apr 2011. One case was
identified at the Austin Hospital on 14 Apr 2011. As a precaution,
patients who attended the Austin's emergency department between 9am
and 7.30pm (AEST) on Thu 14 Apr 2011 are being contacted by hospital
staff. The Victorian Health Department says more than 90 per cent of
attendees have been telephoned so far, and about half of those have
been asked to return this weekend for a measles vaccination. Another
suspected case is recovering in an interstate hospital.

Victoria's chief health officer John Carnie said that while the 4
patients are now recovering, it is possible there may be others who
were infected on the flight. Dr Carnie said the illness usually begins
with common cold symptoms such as fever, sore throat, red eyes, and a
cough. The rash usually begins 3 to 7 days after the 1st symptoms,
generally starting on the face and then spreading to the rest of the
body. "Measles is a highly infectious viral disease that can cause
serious illness, particularly in very young children and adults," Dr
Carnie said. Immunisation is the best defence against measles because
anyone unvaccinated is at risk of contracting the disease, he said.

Anyone developing symptoms is advised to ring ahead to their GP or
hospital first and tell them that they have fever and a rash. The
Health Department advises that anyone who has been in contact with a
measles case should also alert their GP or hospital emergency
department. Adults aged between 26 and 42 years have a lower
immunisation coverage than younger adults and children and therefore
most cases are in this age group. Most people over the age of 42 will
have been exposed to measles in childhood and will be protected. Dr
Carnie said measles is particularly serious in people who are
undergoing cancer treatment or are on high-dose steroids, even if they
have had measles or have been immunised against measles. The measles
vaccine is currently recommended on the National Immunisation Program
for children aged 12 months and 4 years.

Hawke's Bay measles outbreak worsens
------------------------------------
Three more cases of measles have been confirmed by Hawke's Bay
District Health Board, bringing the total to 9. The new cases were
children who had been in isolation waiting to see if they developed
measles, and were all linked to the earlier cases.

On Friday [8 Apr 2011] the Hawke's Bay District Health Board
confirmed 6 cases of measles in Hastings -- the 1st 2 linked to
confirmed cases in Auckland, and the others secondary to the Hastings
cases. All 9 children were from a Flaxmere school and none was
admitted to hospital. Medical officer of health Caroline McElnay said
public health nurses had been in touch with those who may have been
exposed, but she was hopeful no new cases would develop.

Parents were asked to keep sick children at home, and schools to keep
sick children away, in the hope of limiting the spread of the highly
contagious viral infection. The outbreak prompted a warning from
Plunket's clinical adviser Allison Jamieson about vaccinations. She
said vaccination was the most effective form of preventing childhood
illnesses such as measles, for which there was no treatment. It was
easily spread through the air by breathing, coughing, and sneezing.

"Immunisation has a profoundly positive effect not only on the
individual but on the whole of the population, thereby improving
community immunity from the disease," Ms Jamieson said. "It is never
too late to catch up, even if a child has fallen behind on the
immunisation schedule." Children over one year -- who had not had 2
doses of measles vaccine in the past, were eligible for the free MMR
vaccine.

Although most infected people would not need hospitalisation,
complications could arise. The Ministry of Health estimated about one
in 10 cases developed into pneumonia, ear infection, or diarrhoea. One
in 1000 cases got inflammation of the brain, which could lead to
permanent brain damage or even death.

Dr McElnay said measles cases were rare in Hawke's Bay and the last
known was in 2009. This year [2011] the Auckland Regional Public
Health Service reported 24 confirmed cases from between mid-January
and early March. None of the 24 people confirmed with measles had been
vaccinated against it.

The last epidemic of measles in New Zealand was in 1997 when about
2000 people, mostly babies and children, were infected, with more than
300 people needing hospital care. Before immunisation began in 1969,
almost all children caught measles.

Hawke's Bay measles outbreak: 12 cases confirmed
------------------------------------------------
Three more children have contracted measles and more are in isolation
in their homes as the outbreak spreads among a small community group
in Flaxmere. The new confirmed cases brings the total to 12, but that
may rise as Hawke's Bay District Health Board [HBDHB] staff wait to
see whether those in isolation develop the viral infection.

The infected children attend the same Flaxmere school and those in
isolation are from the same community group. Those being isolated had
come into contact with the infected people and were not immune. None
of the infected children were in hospital.

HBDHB public health nurses were in daily contact with those infected,
their school and those in isolation. Medical officer of health
Caroline McElnay said the containment measures had been in place since
the 1st cases became known late last week [week of 4 Apr 2011]. "We're
pretty confident at this stage that we've got it under control, but we
have to see what happens next. Hopefully, we've managed to [contain
the infection] in time and well enough," she said.

Dr McElnay said the cluster of cases was a timely reminder for people
aged under 42, who had not previously had measles, to check the
vaccination status of themselves and their children. The MMR
vaccination was the only form of prevention and health authorities
advised two jabs to give the best chance of immunity. The vaccination
is offered to 15 month old babies and at age 4, but is free for anyone
over 1 and born after 1969 who have not already had 2 jabs.

Dr McElnay urged parents to keep sick children at home, even over the
school holidays. Measles was highly contagious and symptoms initially
mirrored a typical cold. Infected people could experience a runny
nose, cough, irritated eyes, sore throat, and fever, but within 2 to 4
days a rash would appear and spread around the body. "Most children
are miserable and stay in bed, drink lots of fluids, and are fine, but
1 in 10 may need future treatment and end up in hospital." Serious
complications could develop and prove fatal.

Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region confirms 2 cases of measles
-----------------------------------------------------------
Two cases of measles have been confirmed in Regina, adding "there has
been potential exposure in other parts of the province."

The 1st case was found in a 9 month old infant on 2 or 3 Apr 2011,
said the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region's deputy medical health
officer, Dr Maurice Hennick. The 2nd case developed in a 3 year old
household member of the infant. "Patient one is doing very well and
recovering and patient 2 is quite ill," said Hennick. As of Friday [15
Apr 2011], both patients were at home, resting.

Saskatchewan deputy chief medical health officer Dr Saquib Shahab
said the cases are significant enough that the public should be
notified. "We'll be watching very closely over the next several weeks
to see if we get any secondary cases," said Shahab.

A media release said people who were in the waiting area the Pasqua
Hospital's emergency room (ER) on 3 Apr 2011 from 1:30-3:30 pm, on 4
Apr 2011 from 9:30-11:30 am, or 5 Apr 2011 from 1- 3 pm are
"especially cautioned to watch for the appearance of measles."

Hennick said measles is an unusual occurrence in the province. The
last confirmed case was in 2005. "Measles has complications and
certainly can be quite a severe illness," said Hennick. The virus can
cause ear infections, pneumonia, and brain infections in all ages.

There is a 75 per cent voluntary vaccination rate for measles. On
standard cases, a child gets an initial vaccine shot at 12 months and
a 2nd shot at 18 months. Hennick said the 9 month old was obviously
not vaccinated, but the 3 year old had one shot. "We've done extensive
investigations around the possible origins of where this may have
arisen," said Hennick. "That is not clear at this stage and we are
doing further steps to see if we can identify that."

Parents can call the health ministry's HealthLine at 1-877-800-0002
for advice. If visiting a doctor or emergency room, it is recommended
that you call in advance so that the child can be seen in a separate
area without exposing others.

Parents of children one year and older who are not up to date with
immunization are encouraged to call their local public health office
to arrange for vaccination. The public is reminded that measles is
occurring sporadically in Europe, some parts of the USA, and several
cases have also been reported from Quebec and British Columbia in the
past few months. People should ensure they are up to date with all
vaccines prior to travel. If any member of the public is unsure if
they have their shots, they can call their local health region.

4 schools impacted by measles outbreak
--------------------------------------
Granite School District officials say the measles outbreak is now
affecting 4 schools in the district. Last week district officials said
only 2 schools were impacted, but over the weekend 2 more were added
to the list. Schools affected include Olympus High School, William
Penn Elementary, Evergreen Junior High, and Skyline High School.

The students who have not been vaccinated at these schools are being
asked to stay home in isolation for their own safety. The district
also announced that the exclusion date for all students and staff who
have not been immunized has been pushed back to Mon 25 Apr 2011,
because a more recent exposure period of 6 Apr 2011 has been
identified with one of the infected individuals.

The health department has advised the district that they can continue
operating schools as normal with the exclusion of the non-immunized
individuals. "We did sent a district wide call to all of our 90
schools alerting them to the situation, and telling them if they had
unimmunized students to contact their personal physicians to see how
they can alleviate the risk," said Granite District spokesperson Ben
Horsley. School related updates will also be available on the Granite
School District facebook page and twitter account.

Measles, an unusual visitor, shows up in Rhode Island
-----------------------------------------------------
A case of measles, a highly contagious disease that is considered
eradicated in the United States, cropped up in Rhode Island on
Wednesday [13 Apr 2011], according to the state Department of Health.
The patient is a woman in her 20s from Italy who arrived in New York
from that country on Tuesday [12 Apr 2011], said Annemarie
Beardsworth, public information officer for the department. After she
traveled by car to Rhode Island, she sought medical assistance, and
"an astute physician" informed the Department of Health that a
potential case of measles was at hand. A blood test confirmed the
diagnosis.

Measles is an ancient scourge, one of several diseases that Europeans
are thought to have introduced inadvertently to the New World -- one
that decimated the population of Native Americans, who had no
immunity. It can be prevented via the measles, mumps, and rubella
[MMR] vaccine that is standard for American schoolchildren.

The virus can kill. Beardsworth said children are especially
vulnerable, as are individuals with health problems. Beardsworth said
it has been at least 20 years since Rhode Island saw a case of
measles. She said the Department of Health quickly notified
surrounding states and the US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. She said the federal agency is working with airport
officials in New York to track passengers who were on the same flight
and ensure they are up to date on the vaccine. It is recommended that
the vaccine be applied within 72 hours of exposure.

Beardsworth said the patient is in voluntary isolation and has been
"extremely cooperative" and is "doing fine." "The quick response by
the physician" and staff of the Department of Health prevented the
disease from spreading in Rhode Island, Michael Fine, interim director
of the Department of Health, said in a news release. Beardsworth said
the department had identified only about 20 Rhode Islanders who might
have been exposed.
