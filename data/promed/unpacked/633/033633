An outbreak of foot and mouth disease (FMD) has been contained.

"The current outbreak of FMD in Bahrain was reported by the veterinary staff of the Veterinary Control and Animal Health Directorate, starting from 23 Feb to 16 Mar 2015. It affected 13 farms, 251 cattle and resulted in 16 deaths."

The Agriculture and Marine Resources under-secretariat extended the necessary efforts to contain the outbreak, including segregation of infected animals, prophylactic treatment, vaccination of herds in surrounding farms, ring-vaccination, and spraying.

"Samples from infected animals were dispatched to an international FMD reference laboratory to identify the serotype involved in the outbreak for better control and documentation, as required by the World Animal Health Organisation. The veterinary teams continue to monitor the situation daily."

Experts from the department said that the infected cattle would not be slaughtered, as they would have stronger immunity against the disease in the future.

The cases were reported in 13 farms out of 250, which represent 5.2 percent.

[Bahrain suffers occasionally from outbreaks of FMD, probably mainly due to its situation as dependent upon considerable imports of ruminant animals for slaughter, particularly sheep.

The most recent available statistics (number of imported animals) in FAO's database (2011) were as follows:
Cattle: Pakistan 160, Somalia 178. UAE 303.
Goats: Pakistan 300, Saudia 456, Somalia 1686, Sri Lanka 80, UAE 262.
Sheep: Australia 696 713, Djibouti 220, Kenya 185, Saudia 25 402, Somalia 6512, Syria 3136, UAE 63.

According to the Bahrain page of WRLFMD (World Reference Laboratory for FMD, Pirbright), the following serotypes have been reported from Bahrain throughout the years:

Serotype / Years
FMDV-O / 1966-1968, 1971, 1979, 1987-1993, 1995-1999, 2001, 2008, 2011-2012, 2014
FMDV-A / 1965, 2008-2009, 2011
FMDV-C / 0000
FMDV-Asia 1 / 1985, 2009, 2011
FMDV-SAT 1 / 1962
FMDV-SAT 2 / 2012
FMDV-SAT 3 / 0000

The FMDV serotype SAT-2, which circulated in Bahrain in 2012, was genotyped by the WRLFMD as topotype IV, lineage 'Ken-09', most probably introduced from East Africa. The FMDV serotype O, which circulated in Bahrain in 2014, was genotyped by WRLFMD as topotype 'ME-SA', lineage 'PanAsia-2ANT-10'. The full reports on the said 2 strains and on additional strains/serotypes are available at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/me/bar.htm.

Results of the serotyping and genotyping from the reference laboratory, probably indicative of the probable source of infection, will be appreciated. - Mod.AS
