In what is turning out to be a bird-flu centric morning, we have an announcement from the Egyptian Ministry of Health on 2 new (apparently unrelated) human avian influenza H5N1 cases. The last case reported previously out of Egypt was in late September 2014 (Egyptian MOH: 4th H5N1 case of 2014).

[While today's [16 Nov 2014] cases bring Egypt's total to 6 cases for the year, the FluTrackers website has an additional case confirmed by the regional (Beheira) Ministry of Health, which would bring the total to 7. In addition, the 2nd case mentioned above has a daughter who is being examined and tested for the virus.]

The Ministry of Health has announced the discovery of 2 cases of human infection with avian A/H5N1 influenza virus, thus bringing the number of cases of the disease during the current year to 6 cases, after the discovery of these 2 cases. The ministry said that the 1st case is a 3 year old child in Minoya Governorate and has already being exposed to birds at her home and is in good health and receiving treatment at a hospital in Minoya Governorate.

As for the 2nd case, the patient is a woman aged 19 in Assiut Governorate, who has been slaughtering birds at home after the deaths of several [of them]. She was admitted to one of the private clinics from where she was transferred to a hospital at Assiut University [and found to be suffering from] from double pneumonia. She is currently on a ventilator in critical condition and has been given a double dose of Tamiflu [oseltamivir] and remains under treatment.

[Avian influenza or "bird flu" is an infectious disease of animals (usually birds, and less commonly pigs) caused by type A strains of the influenza virus. Transmission to humans is rare, but there is recent cause for concern. In mid-2003, the largest and most severe avian flu outbreak in history began in South East Asia, caused by a sub-type of the virus called H5N1 and resulting in widespread transmission to poultry and some documented transmission to humans. Transmission of H5N1 to humans is of particular concern because it mutates rapidly and may, therefore, change into a form that is highly infectious for humans and more easily spread. In addition, unlike normal seasonal influenza, H5N1 often causes severe disease in humans.

The cumulative number of confirmed human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) reported to WHO, 2003-2014, can be found at http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/EN_GIP_20140124CumulativeNumberH5N1cases.pdf?ua=1.
