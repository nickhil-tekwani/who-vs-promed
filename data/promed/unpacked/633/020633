According to the 13 Oct 2006 update of table 11 (animal disease situation
per country and per disease) the total number of bluetongue outbreaks
reported by European Union member states during the period 1 Jan 2006 to 13
Oct 2006 was 715. The total accumulated number in previous week's update (6
Oct 2006) was 501; this means that 214 new outbreaks have been reported
during the last week: a significant rise in the incidence of the reported
outbreaks.
The following (accumulated) outbreaks were reported from each of the 4
affected countries:
Country / No outbreaks (previous week's data) / last date of confirmation
Belgium / 297 (201) / 12 Oct 2006
Germany / 208 (150) / 11 Oct 2006
France / 4 (4) / 5 Sep 2006
Netherlands / 206 (146) / 12 Oct 2006

[Since 6 Oct 2006, 96 new confirmed outbreaks have been added to last
week's 201 in Belgium, where the outbreak started, reportedly, on 18 Aug
2006; 58 new confirmed outbreaks have been added to last week's 150 in
Germany, where the outbreak started, reportedly, on 21 Aug 2006; and 50 new
confirmed outbreaks have been added to last week's 146 in the Netherlands,
where the outbreak started, reportedly, on 14 Aug 2006. France has not
reported new outbreaks since 5 Sep 2006.
The Belgian data, as presented on the national website, seem to indicate
that most new cases affect sheep rather than cattle. See at
<http://www.favv.be/crisis/sa-blueT/doc/Resume-cas_20061012_Foyers-Graph.pdf>.
The outbreak was expected to peak as soon as temperatures drop; since this
has not happened yet, there is no room for complacency in neighbouring
countries, particularly the UK.

2006, is available at
