A recent outbreak of _Escherichia coli_ [infection] may be linked to a Portillo's in Glendale Heights, the Illinois Department of Public Health said Friday [6 Aug 2021]. Four cases of a toxin producing the bacteria and one case of a resultant blood syndrome stemmed from customers eating at the Portillo's at 235 E North Ave on 16 and 17 Jul [2021], IDPH said in a health alert.

A Portillo's spokeswoman said the company was taking the matter seriously and is cooperating with health authorities. "The health and safety of our team members and guests is our top priority," Sara Wirth said in a statement. "Across Portillo's, we have extensive sanitary and food handling guidelines in place, including daily deep cleanings of all restaurants. ... Once notified (of the outbreak), we moved quickly and began assisting with the investigation and revisiting our food safety best practices with our team members to mitigate potential future risk."

[Given the description, the culprit is likely to be a Shiga-toxin-producing enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_, either the prototypical serotype O157:H7 or another, and the "blood syndrome" is likely hemolytic- uremic syndrome. In Chicago, Portillo's is well known for their sliced beef sandwiches and Chicago-style hotdogs, both Chicago-style "street food", but the chain also serves hamburgers and salads, both more likely vehicles for transmission of this zoonotic infection.

The following has been extracted from Lutwick LI. Enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ infections. In: Confronting emerging zoonoses: The One Health paradigm. Yamada A, Kahn LH, Kaplan B, et al. (editors). Tokyo, Japan: Springer:

"Risk factors for the subsequent development of HUS after EHEC include children less than 10 years of age, elevated white blood cell counts, persistent low platelet counts without reversal, and the use of either antimicrobial agents or antimotility agents during the diarrhea stage before or after bloody diarrhea develops. Since fever is generally not part of the presentation but significant abdominal pain is, patients with diarrhea, significant abdominal pain, and no fever should be considered to have EHEC infection, and antimicrobial or antimotility agents should be avoided. Additionally, certain strains -- for example, the so-called clade 8 and the chimeric organism _E. coli_ O104:H4 -- can be associated with a higher risk of HUS.

"HUS itself is a thrombotic illness primarily caused by the effects of the EHEC-produced Shiga toxin acting on the vascular endometrium of organs where the toxin's receptors are expressed, particularly the kidney and brain. The syndrome consists of the combination of prominent low platelet counts (thrombocytopenia), intravascular red blood cell destruction (hemolysis), and diminished kidney function that can require hemodialysis. Neurological involvement occurs mostly in those who develop renal failure, and the central nervous system involvement portends much higher mortality. Indeed, most of the acute mortality relates to neurological disease. Most patients will recover, but some, perhaps 10%, remain with renal failure and require chronic hemodialysis." - Mod.LL
