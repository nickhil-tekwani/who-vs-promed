[1] Cholera - Zimbabwe (Harare)

A cholera scare has hit some parts of Harare amid reports that more than 900 people in Mabvuku high-density suburb were affected by a suspected cholera-related diarrhea last week [week ending 22 Jun 2014] after consuming dirty water. Similar cases of diarrhea have also been reported in Chitungwiza, Highfield and other high-density areas.

The reports came as residents told Parliament on Tuesday, 24 Jun 2014, that they had resorted to the bucket system as there was no running water in most suburbs. Combined Harare Residents' Association (CHRA) said more than 900 people had been taken ill due to diarrhoea in Mabvuku amid fears that the outbreak could spread to other parts of the capital city.

"This was revealed from our community monitoring report for the week ending Saturday, 21 Jun 2014, by our ward co-ordinators. Mabvuku Poly Clinic recorded 530 cases with Mabvuku Satellite Clinic recording 372 patients by midday Thursday, 19 Jun 2014, and the situation indicates that more people are still trickling to the health centers for medical check-ups," CHRA said.

A Chitungwiza resident said: "We don't have working toilets in Chitungwiza. Sewage blocks daily, the pipes are worn out and people take water from contaminated sources. People excrete in plastics and throw them away." She added: "Children just play their street soccer and when it lands in the sewage, they just pick it up and continue playing as if nothing happened. Others use buckets; if we are supposed to be real people, we need respect. There is no health to talk about in Chitungwiza, it's just sewage flowing all over."

[A resident] of Old Tafara also said they last had running water 15 years ago. "People are in serious trouble. Some people, most of them 6 or 7 [living] in single quarters, and this is not healthy at all in a place without water. People are building houses along a stream at Caledonia Farm, and it has since dried up," [the resident] said.

[2] Cholera - Nigeria (Jigawa)

A total of 7 people were confirmed dead while over 306 are infected following the cholera outbreak in the ancient city of Hadejia, Jigawa State. Reports from the city revealed that the sign of the outbreak started over the weekend [21-22 Jun 2014] and the situation became aggravated on 23-24 Jun 2014.

However, visiting the city yesterday, 25 Jun 2014, Leadership observed that the situation had now subsided, and not more than 30 victims of the outbreak remain at Hadejia General Hospital for treatment.

The state governor, Alhaji Sule Lamido, had also visited the city to observe the situation and sympathize with victims and the families of those who lost their loved ones. At the palace of the emir of Hadejia, Governor Lamido stated that poor environmental and personal hygiene had been identified as the major causes of the epidemic. Lamido also told the journalist that the situation was under control due to the quick government intervention, which included sending reinforcement of health workers and providing free treatment to all the victims.

Confirming the figure of the victims, the state commissioner for health, Dr Tafida Abubakar, told Leadership that out of the 306 cases reported to the hospital, 7 people died and 22 remained hospitalized, while all the rest had been discharged.

Dr Tafida added that effective measures had been taken to contain the disease and stop it from spreading to other places.

[3] Cholera - Nepal (Central Region)

So far, a total of 1135 patients have been affected by cholera in Gaidatar, which lies 55 km [about 34 miles] north of [Rautahat] district [Central region] headquarters Gaur. And the number of patients visiting the free health camp set up in the village is on the rise.

Health assistant Sanjeev, who is currently overseeing the treatment of cholera victims at the camp, said that the deadly epidemic, believed to be caused by contaminated drinking water, has not been brought under control yet. Due to lack of clean and hygienic drinking water, locals are forced to consume contaminated water from the river.

A Gaidakot local attributed the cholera outbreak to open defecation by the residents of Dhiyal VDC, which is located upstream. Interestingly, Dhiyal VDC in Makawanpur was declared open defecation free.

Admitting the failure to bring the epidemic under control, Duryodhan Prasad Chandrabanshi, acting superintendent of the DPHO, Rautahat, said cholera patients, after treatment, started consuming contaminated drinking water in the village and got infected again.

Locals are worried as well as furious as the situation remains unabated even after the visit of Khagraj Adhikari, minister for Health and Population and Narayan Khadaka, minister for Urban Development.

[4] Cholera, diarrhea - India (Kerala)

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/City/Kochi/Ernakulam-district-put-on-cholera-alert/articleshow/37067407.cms


With cases of cholera being reported from various parts of the state [Kerala], the Ernakulam health department has issued a warning to contain the spread of the disease in the district. Though no cholera case has been reported from the district in 2014, around 11 035 people were reported to have suffered from diarrhea from January to May in 2014. "We have warned the public to keep vigil," said P N Sreenivasan, rural health officer.

The disease results from eating food or drinking water contaminated with a bacterium called _Vibrio cholerae_. "As cholera is a water and food-borne disease, people should be extra vigilant. They should avoid eating cold food kept in refrigerators. They should also ensure that they eat only fresh and hot food served by hotels and eateries," Sreenivasan said.

[5] Cholera - India (Kerala), possible nosocomial spread

With the death of a 54-year-old woman who was undergoing treatment for cholera late Thursday night, 26 Jun 2014, the district administration and the Health Department have stepped up preventive measures in Alathur, Kuthanur and Chembukavu regions in the district [Palakkad district, Kerala state] from where 4 persons with symptoms of the water-borne disease had sought expert treatment at the Government Medical College in Thrissur.

The woman, from Kuthanur, succumbed to illness at the Thrissur Medical College on Thursday night, 26 Jun 2014, after 13 days of treatment for cholera. Her family members said she contracted the disease after she was admitted to a private hospital in Alathur following fever and vomiting. Her husband, who took care of her at the hospital, is now under treatment for cholera; 3 nurses of the hospital are also under treatment, they said. Health officials suspect that they may have been infected with the disease, possibly from consumption of contaminated water and food.

An expert team of doctors from Thrissur Medical College, under the supervision of additional professor Nileena Koshi, is camping in the area. More experts would reach there soon. They will investigate the reason for the sudden upsurge in cholera cases, apart from identifying short-term and long-term measures to prevent the disease. The district administration will conduct raids on canteens, hotels, and restaurants to ensure the quality of food. The authorities have appealed to the public to maintain personal hygiene while handling food and water.

Sanitation measures should be strengthened in all areas and local bodies should ensure that drinking water sources are not contaminated. Chlorination of wells and sprinkling of bleaching powder around water sources should be done periodically.

An outbreak of dysentery among schoolchildren has been reported in Xingguo County in east China's Jiangxi Province, local authorities said on Wednesday, 25 Jun 2014. From Thursday, 19 June 2014, to Tuesday, 24 Jun 2014, dozens of pupils, aged from 6 to 12, of Liening Primary School in Xingguo's Changgang township have been suffering from fever and diarrhea, according to the county's press office.

As of Wednesday, 25 Jun 2014, 67 students remain in hospital for treatment and observation. 53 of them were confirmed with bacillary dysentery. The children had drunk water from a school well, which had been contaminated by rain, according to an initial investigation.

The school, which has 575 pupils, has been closed since Friday, 20 Jun 2014. Classes are expected to resume on Thursday, 26 Jun 2014.

A water company has started sending water to the school so staff and students no longer have to rely on the well.

The education department of Jiangxi has issued a notice to all schools to ensure safe drinking water for students.
