Russia: Outbreak of Hepatitis A in Schools in Ekaterinburg
---------------------------------------------------
The hepatitis A situation in Ekaterinburg is serious. First of all, it
affects schoolchildren. Every week there are cases of hepatitis registered
in schools. Sometimes several children are hospitalized from the same
school. Epidemiologists are urging the necessity of mass vaccination of the
population against hepatitis [A].
School N 114 in Ekaterinburg was closed for quarantine because 4 children
were infected simultaneously with hepatitis. This week 4 cases were
registered in school N 40 and 3 cases in school N 92. For the past month
hepatitis A cases were recorded in almost every district of Ekaterinburg.
At schools where cases were identified, physicians are implementing
epidemic prevention activities, such as regular inspection of
schoolchildren, disinfections, etc. It is planned to carry out
district-wide vaccinations .
Doctors are claiming that there are no large outbreaks of hepatitis in
schools, but accept that the situation is serious. According to physicians
the rise in the incidence is explained by the cyclic nature of infection:
every 5 to 6 years. Mass vaccination is not feasible because of the cost:
each vaccine [dose] costs 500 rubles, and every person needs to be
immunized twice. Civilians [are reluctant to pay for vaccination from their
own resources].

[If vaccination is not an option, it would seem prudent to identify the
source of these recurrent outbreaks, which in view of their city-wide
distribution are likely to be a consequence of contaminated water or food
supplies. Eradication of the source of the contamination would preclude the
need for vaccination. - Mod.CP]
