[1] Israel, dog-mediated, control, discussion

Experts in public health, nature conservation, and veterinary medicine warn of the implications of the bill promoted these days in the coalition for the 'Release of stray dogs after receiving a rabies vaccination, spaying or neutering.'

According to the sources, returning the dogs to open areas without supervision will lead to the risk of an outbreak of disease, increasing the risk of attacks to humans and harming wildlife. On the other hand, animal organizations and lawmakers argue that this is a step that will help reduce the population of stray dogs, whose number is estimated in the tens of thousands.

The experts said this ahead of a discussion to be held in the Knesset's Education and Sports Committee [KESC] on [Wed 23 Feb 2022] in the bill submitted by MKs Jasmine Sachs Friedman ('Yesh Atid') and Sharan Hashakel ('Tikva Hadasha'), to be approved as a temporary order for 2 years. According to the order, a pilot project is initially to be held, during which unowned, stray-feral dogs will be collected but, in difference with the prevailing legislation, they will be released after being vaccinated, or sterilized/neutered. The performance will be within the responsibility of an animal protection organization and in areas belonging to a municipal authority that had given consent to the procedure. In case it turns out that the experimental [2-year] project does reduce the stray dog population, it will become possible to extend its duration for another 3 years.

Minister of Agriculture Oded Forer ('Yisrael Beiteinu') supports the law, as do animal rights organizations. On the other hand, professionals of the State veterinary services recommended addressing the stray dog issue by regulating, nationally, the breeding and maintenance of dogs along with the establishment of additional kennels and subsidization of spaying and neutering activities of dogs within needy municipalities.

According to the Ministry of Health, the risk of serious injury from a stray dog bite is twice larger than an owned dog bite. This, on top of spreading diseases such as rabies. Another concern is that the stray dogs prey on wildlife and protected animals such as gazelles and Persian fallow deer.

The "Government Forum for One Health", which advises the government on health issues, also warned against the emerging legislation. The head of the public health services at the Ministry of Health, Dr Sharon Elroi Price, a member of said forum, along with other experts from the Ministries of Agriculture and Environmental Protection, warned that returned, unattended stray dogs will endanger the public and that their vaccination will not render them with adequate, durable protection from rabies.

Most professional bodies specializing in animal population control are not convinced that available studies confirmed the claim that the method is effective in reducing the population of stray dogs. Forum members said that similar pilots conducted around the world have indeed not resulted in a reduction. "Captured adoptable dogs may be ready for adoption after being sterilized/neutered and the full vaccination against rabies administered", the forum members noted. "Non-adoptable dogs have to go through long training and domestication procedures or alternatively, unfortunately being euthanised humanely."

Another body that has expressed opposition to the move is the 'Israeli Association of Public Health Physicians'. According to a member of the organization, Prof. Eyal Clement from the Hebrew University School of Veterinary Medicine, to attain success, the pilot should neuter between 70% and 80% of the stray dogs -- a target estimated as not implementable. According to him and additional experts, the move may even lead to the migration of stray dogs from other areas to the pilot area -- which will actually cause an increase in its population.

In the Ministry of Environmental Protection, the views are divided. Gali Davidson, head of the Department of Animal Protection, supports the pilot, in difference with the view of the chief scientist in the Ministry, Prof Noga Kronfeld-Schur. During the 1st KESC discussion held 3 weeks ago, Davidson said that the proposed temporary provisions deserve to be seen as "another tool" for "addressing the problem, testing, and correcting it through a test program. Some countries are already doing so with nice results."

Yael Arkin, CEO of "Let the Animals Live", also expressed her support for the pilot and said: "We are already trying for years to promote initiatives to increase assistance and budget for sterilization and neutering and no one supports them. The Ministry of Agriculture and the Nature and Parks Authority kill a large number of dogs every year, even in areas where there is no fear of rabies spread, and we see that the problem is not solved. It is time to stop killing again and again. Contrary to many people's beliefs, this is a successful initiative in the world."

[Rabies in Israel, initially of the 'urban' type (predominantly dog-mediated in urban and rural areas) has become 'sylvatic' (wild-life mediated) since the introduction, during the 2nd half of the last century, of compulsory annual certification and vaccination of dogs and requiring leashing in public sites, which led to the absence of rabies in Israel's cities for decades.

The number of rabies outbreaks (villages) and cases (animals), 1991-2020, are presented graphically on page 33 of the 2020 annual report of the VSAH (Veterinary Services & Animal Health) at https://www.gov.il/BlobFolder/reports/doch-shnati-vet-2020/he/vet_doch-shnati-vet-2020.pdf.

During 2004-2007, the biological and molecular characterization of the rabies isolates showed that free-roaming, stray dogs re-emerged as a significant animal reservoir in Northern Israel. The virus isolates from foxes and dogs differed in their molecular characterization, suggesting 2 distinct separate lineages. The transition from fox-mediated rabies to dog-mediated rabies became, obviously, of great concern to public health. The last human rabies case was reported in 2003. Post exposure treatments are abundant.

During the past 15 years, jackals gradually replaced foxes as the sylvatic reservoir of the virus. However, in recent years dog rabies increased, becoming the dominant presentation in 2021, concentrated mainly in regions bordering Lebanon and Syria.

Data of (lab-confirmed) events during the last 5 years:
Year / all animals / dog / jackal
2017 / 74 / 10 / 47
2018 / 60 / 6 / 45
2019 / 17 / 10 / 7
2020 / 47 / 15 / 24
2021/ 40 / 21 / 10

(Besides jackals and dogs, few cases were recorded in cats, badgers, a wolf, cattle, and sheep. Not a single fox).

In regard to the alleged success of the proposed Dog Population Management (DPM) policy, incorporating the collection, sterilization, vaccination (which requires a booster!), and release of free-roaming dogs, subscribers are encouraged to visit a paper, authored by investigators from prominent research centers in USA, UK, and South Africa, reviewing available reports of DPM attempts, globally (see reference below).

Among their findings:
1. "In practice, there is very limited evidence of DPM tools achieving reductions in the size or turnover of dog populations in canine rabies-endemic areas. Different DPM tools are frequently used together and combined with rabies vaccinations, but full impact assessments of DPM programs are not usually available."
2. "Community engagement focused on promoting responsible dog ownership and better veterinary care could improve the health of individual animals and dog vaccination coverage, thus reducing rabies transmission."
3. "It is important to understand local dog populations and community attitudes toward them in order to determine whether and how DPM might contribute to rabies control and which DPM tools would be most successful."
4. "Surgical sterilization is the most frequently documented tool and has successfully reduced dog population size and turnover in a few low-income settings. However, DPM programs are mostly conducted in urban settings."

Notably, the proposed pilot in Israel is not planned to be applied in an urban setting. Israel's owned dog population (2020 data) exceeds 500 000 pets, of which about 460 000 vaccinated. The recording of cases in (apparently, unvaccinated) dogs, despite the herd immunity, may reflect the rate of exposure hazard, in the regional context.

[2] Malaysia (Sibu, Sarawak province): dog, suspected, human exposure
Date: Sat 19 Feb 2022 8:51 pm MST

There is a possibility that the dog that attacked the 3 people at Sungai Maaw ferry point in Sungai Bidut [in Sibu, Sarawak] on Friday [18 Feb 2022], might have been infected with rabies. [* See below for details of the event, published by 'Borneo post'].

In stating this, however, the Sibu Health Office pointed out that the matter would still require a confirmation from the Department of Veterinary Services. "From the way the dog had behaved, it's possible that it's a rabid dog, but this needs to be confirmed by the Department of Veterinary Services," it said in a statement today [19 Feb 2022].

Asked if the victims were hospitalized, the Health Office said usually for a dog-bite case, there would be no need for hospitalization. "(They would be) treated as outpatients, but they would be given appointments to come for vaccination," it said.

Asked if the dog was still with its owner, the office said: "In cases like this, the authorities would take urgent action to catch the dog and the (Veterinary Services) Department would test if it's rabies-infected."

Additionally, it stressed that the public must be aware of the importance of getting their pets vaccinated against rabies and also neutering them.

"Don't adopt strays as pets, unless (they have) been given rabies vaccination," it advised.

Meanwhile, the Department of Veterinary Services Sarawak (DVSS) director Dr Adrian Susin Ambud said should the result confirm that the dog was rabies-infected, the animal would die within 10 days.

"The owner needs to surrender the dog to the DVSS for testing," called Dr Adrian.

He also advised members of the public to contact the nearest veterinary office to obtain further information about anti-rabies vaccination.

With regard to making reports about stray dogs, one could utilize the Sarawak Rabies App, downloadable via Google Play Store for Android users, and App Store for Apple users.

Early Friday [18 Feb 2022], a dog attacked 3 people, one of whom was its owner, at Sungai Maaw ferry point in Sungai Bidut. The incident said to have occurred between 7 am and 8.30 am, left the dog's owner and 2 passers-by -- a teenager and a man, in his 50s -- with bites. The man said he would go to the area occasionally and each time, he would see a number of dogs roaming around.

"This (Friday) morning [18 Feb 2022], one of the dogs suddenly went wild and started biting people," he said. It was reported that the teenager sustained bite wounds on her fingers, while the woman was bitten on the leg and a finger. All 3 had gone to Sibu Hospital for treatment, including getting the rabies vaccine.

[For the location of the Sungai Maaw ferry point (Sarawat Bidut) see map at https://tinyurl.com/mwcfk2ha. It is located in Sarawak, Malaysia's largest state (among 13), on the northwest of Borneo Island, which is shared by Indonesia's Kalimantan. Sarawak's area is almost equal to that of Peninsular Malaysia, which is situated some 900 km (615 mi) to its west. Rabies reemerged in Sarawak in 2015, after being eradicated there 16 years earlier, and has been circulating since in the dog population. Until May 2021, 33 human deaths have been reported.

It may be assumed that the post-exposure treatment of the 3 bitten persons would/has been applied without delay, even if rabies of the biting dog has not yet been lab-confirmed. The lab test addresses samples, obtained if/when the dog dies, preferably brain stem, Ammon's horn, thalamus, cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and medulla oblongata. For rabies diagnostic methods, see chapter 3.01.17 of OIE's Terrestrial Manual, at https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.01.17_RABIES.pdf. - Mod.AS

A rabies incident took place on 15 Feb 2022 in the Bahcelievler Neighborhood, Derik District, in Mardin province. [AC] (5), [AOK] (10), [RY] (11), [MY] (14), [KO] (21), [MO] (45), and [EE] (35), who were attacked by a stray dog on the way back from school, were injured on various body parts. With the intervention of the locals, the dog got away, and medical teams were sent to the scene. After the 1st interventions, the wounded, who were taken to the hospitals in Derik, Kiziltepe, and Mardin, were vaccinated against rabies and were discharged after their treatment.

The sample of the captured dog, taken at the Mardin Metropolitan Municipality Animal Shelter, was found rabies positive in the examinations made at the Elazig Veterinary Control Institute. Thereupon, with the decision of the District Animal Health Police Commission, the entrance and exit of all kinds of animals, animal substances, and products to the neighborhood were prohibited for a period of 6 months [see comment]. In addition, the commission also stated that no animals will be slaughtered without the permission of the veterinarian, that the surrounding provinces and districts are in quarantine due to rabies in the neighborhood, that everyone who has contact with a rabid dog is vaccinated, that the 'rabies risk zone' sign is posted at the entrance and exit of the neighborhood, and that the animals are released by making sound warnings by the municipality. It was decided to declare that it was forbidden to roam.

One of the residents of the neighborhood stated that they learned today [19 Feb 2022] that the dog had rabies and said, "I go to high school; I can't go to school because of the fear of dogs. We want all dogs to be collected," he said.

[ProMED thanks Mahmoud Orabi for his submission.

Bahçelievler is a large middle class residential suburb of Istanbul, on the European side of the city. Turkey is regarded to be the only country in Europe where urban dog-mediated rabies persists. Control measures in recent decades have reduced the burden of rabies to relatively low levels but foci of the disease persist, particularly in urban areas.

The measures undertaken in response to the described incident, including the ban on the introduction of animal products, seem excessive. Rabies is transmitted by direct, close animal-to animal as well as animal-to-human contacts, mostly bites. Maximal vaccination coverage and strict control of animal movements are the measures of choice. - Mod.AS
