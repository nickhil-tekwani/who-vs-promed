Egyptian boy contracts bird flu virus
-------------------------------------
A 2-year-old Egyptian boy has contracted the highly pathogenic bird
flu virus, bringing to 61 the number of confirmed cases in the most
populous Arab country, state news agency MENA said on Wed 1 Apr 2009.
Egypt, hit harder by bird flu than any other country outside of Asia,
has seen an upswing in bird flu cases over the past month, with 6 new
human infections.

The boy, from the province of Beheira in northern Egypt, was believed
to have contracted the H5N1 [avian influenza] virus after coming into
contact with infected birds, MENA quoted health ministry spokesman
Abdel Rahman Shahine as saying. The boy was taken to hospital on
Monday [30 Mar 2009] after he came down with a high fever while
visiting extended family in another province. He was being treated
with the antiviral drug Tamiflu.

Egypt is one of the few countries affected by bird flu that does not
compensate farmers when poultry is destroyed, though many experts say
this is the best way to ensure rapid detection of new outbreaks.
Since 2003, the H5N1 avian influenza virus has infected at least 410
people in 15 countries and killed 254 of them. It has killed or
forced the culling of more than 300 million birds in 61 countries in
Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Europe. Some 23 Egyptians have died
after contracting the virus, most after coming into contact with
infected domestic birds in a country where roughly 5 million
households depend on domestically raised poultry as a main source of
food and income. While H5N1 rarely infects people, experts fear it
could mutate into a form that people could easily pass to one
another, sparking a pandemic that could kill millions.
