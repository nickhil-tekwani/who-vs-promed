Local health authorities said on Monday [13 Aug 2012], 7 cases of cutaneous anthrax have been confirmed in north east China's Liaoning Province.

A village in Liaozhong county in which 3 cases were reported is under quarantine as a ban has been placed on livestock and meat products entering or leaving its boundaries, the Liaoning provincial health bureau stated. Currently there are no fatal cases, the statement added.

Also on Monday [13 Aug 2012], a health ministry spokesman said that 2 cases of cutaneous anthrax have been confirmed in Lianyungang of east China's Jiangsu Province. Skin irritations were found among 7 villagers in Lianyungang, said Deng Haihua, the ministry spokesman, at a press conference in Beijing. The symptoms of the other 5 villagers were not typical, but they have also been placed under medical observation, he said. All 7 villagers are in stable, non-serious conditions, according to Deng.

The infected villagers were believed to have taken part in killing a sick cow.

The provincial health department responded shortly after the events were reported. Medical teams were sent to treat the villagers and sanitize the farm and their residences, Deng said.

The spokesman explained that health departments will strengthen their monitoring for anthrax and help educate local people about the disease, while agricultural departments have also been informed of the events. "We will closely follow the development of these cases and make sure the disease is under control," he vowed.

[Jiangsu is a newly reporting province for this disease. Liaoning is a regular. For the past 5 years China has been reporting some 421 to 309 human cases with just the occasional death. While this is a troubling incidence, they reported 4240 cases in 1980, and 2305 in 1990, so the situation is improving. - Mod.MHJ
