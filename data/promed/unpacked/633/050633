South Canterbury had an increase in cryptosporidiosis, which was
caused by a tiny parasite in animal feces, Dr Williams said.
Sixteen cases -- 6 in Ashburton, 2 in Waimate, and 8 in Timaru --
were reported in September 1999.
Symptoms include diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting,
fever, and headaches, and usually last 1 to 2 weeks.
Many of the cases notified had had contact with scouring calves.
Personal hygiene, especially hand washing, was important, Dr
Williams said.

of many farm animal species. Persons in contact animals having
diarrhea should exercise fastidious personal hygiene. - Mod.TG
