More than 2000 cholera cases in Mali
-------------------------------------
The cholera epidemic along River Niger in Mali is increasing, according to
local media. By now, more than 2000 cholera cases have been reported and
some 117 Malians have died. The widespread nature of the epidemic makes it
difficult to control.
Malian media, quoting local medical sources, say that the current cholera
epidemic already has caused 2016 reported infections, including 117 deaths.
The epidemic is spreading along River Niger, the country's lifeline.
Most of the 2 016 cases have been in the regions of Segou, Mopti,
Timbouctou, and Sikasso. Only the latter region is not placed at River
Niger, which is held responsible for the spread of the disease. According
to the World Health Organisation (WHO), there is a total number of 13
clusters affected by the current cholera outbreak.
Cholera started spreading in August 2003 in Mali. It was associated to
sewage into River Niger from the outskirts of Bamako, the Malian capital.
In the following months, the water-borne disease was reported in several
cities and towns several hundreds of kilometers down-river. Recently, the
epidemic also has reached Sikasso, a regional town far away from the river
and close to Burkina Faso.
The WHO has been involved in trying to control the epidemic since 2003, but
in its latest Mali update, says this now was "very difficult due to the
spread of several clusters of cases throughout the country."
Already since the beginning of 2004, WHO has registered a total of 280 new
cases with 33 deaths. This represents a relatively high case fatality rate
of 11.78 percent, the UN agency warned. WHO is providing medical supplies
and specific technical assistance to control the outbreak.
In November 2003, the international organisation Medecins sans Frontieres
(MSF) warned that up to half a million Malians were put at risk by the
cholera outbreak. The local population along the Niger are mainly nomadic
fishermen who rely on the river water for drinking, cooking, and washing,
MSF explained.
Malian health authorities meanwhile engage in awareness campaigns directed
at making people avoid unclean water. The Ministry of Health, together with
the armed forces, have engaged "Surveillance Brigades" to control the
epidemic, recently announced Minister Keita Rokiatou N'Diaye as she was
visiting the field work operations.

More than 650 cholera cases in Togo
-------------------------------------
A cholera epidemic in the Togolese capital, Lome, has so far caused 661
cases and 37 deaths, according to the Togolese Red Cross. While the
epidemic is still on the increase, the Red Cross is heading information and
awareness work to prevent a greater disaster in the city of 700 000
inhabitants.
The Togolese Red Cross Society reports from Lome that it is now supporting
an urgent collaborative response to the cholera epidemic in the Togolese
capital city. While 37 Lome citizens have already died from cholera, there
are reports that the epidemic is still increasing.
At a meeting a month ago, the Togolese Red Cross had agreed to mobilise and
train a further 150 volunteers to respond to the epidemic. The response to
the Lome epidemic is headed by the Togolese Ministry of Health and the
World Health Organisation (WHO).
According to the Togolese Red Cross, its volunteers have by now visited
some 1250 households in the affected region and reached more than 20 000
people with "information and education on prevention and management."
Together with local health authorities and the WHO, Red Cross volunteers
are now conducting a mass awareness campaigns through radio and public
institutions such as schools. Other activities to control the spread of the
epidemic include active case surveillance and referring infected persons to
special clinics established to treat cholera patients.
There is fear of the epidemic escalating as the rains are increasing, the
Togolese Red Cross says. The organization has therefore requested more
support for a more effective intervention.

Cholera in Mozambique
--------------------------
The Ministry of Health of Mozambique has reported a total of 15 237 cases
and 85 deaths between 20 Dec 2003 and 18 Mar 2004 in 7 provinces (Maputo,
Gaza, Sofala, Zambesia, Nampula, Inhambane, and Tete). Maputo city is the
worst-affected area with 9522 cases and 37 deaths.
A cholera emergency was declared by the Ministry of Health on 9 Jan 2004.
WHO and other agencies, including UNICEF, Medecins sans Frontieres, World
Food Programme, the United States Agency for International Development
(USAID), and the Italian Government are supporting local health authorities
in containing the outbreak.

Cholera confirmed as killer of 13 in Transkei
---------------------------------------------
13 people in the Eastern Cape have died from cholera and more than 100 had
to be treated in hospital for the disease after a recent outbreak. The
provincial government has promised the affected communities emergency
medical resources to stop the spread of the disease.
Monwabisi Goqwana, the health MEC, yesterday flew to Sebeni in Ntabankulu,
one of 3 affected villages, to confirm the outbreak. Goqwana appealed to
the community not to blame the deaths on witchcraft.
During 2003, the Eastern Cape health department delivered 200 water tanks
to the areas around Qumbu to address the cholera problem. Cholera strains
usually plague the area once summer rains start. The disease has claimed
many lives over the past 3 years in rural Transkei, due to a lack of clean
water and sanitation.
Meanwhile, the Japanese government has provided an additional R37 million
[USD 5.6 million] for a water supply project in the Eastern Cape. A total
of R71 million [USD 10.8 million] has now been invested in the
project. The project has thus far provided water to 13 communities in the
Eastern Cape, and 8 more will now benefit.
The money will be spent on water pipes and 12 new wells.

Cholera Hits State Lodge
-----------------------
Cholera has broken out at State Lodge in Lusaka, with 4 people currently
undergoing treatment at various cholera centers. Acting assistant for
press and public relations at State House, Jack Kalala, confirmed the
outbreak at the police camp, housing staff and families of presidential
security staff at the presidential lodge, although the situation had been
contained. The affected are mainly police officers and their families.
He said 16 people were discharged yesterday and there were no deaths
reported. He dismissed assertions that a child had died in the camp,
saying the child who had died lived near the affected area and was being
treated in the house for cholera, where she died. Kalala said the cause of
the outbreak was due to a sewer pipe that burst and contaminated the
drinking water in the police camp. He said the pipe is currently being
worked on by the Ministry of Works and Supply.
Kalala said the camp was now being serviced by the Zambia National Service
(ZNS), who were providing safe water. He said the Minister of Health Dr.
Brian Chituwo had since been to State Lodge to assess the situation, which
he found to be stable. He said cholera cases had reduced to a manageable
level.
According to a source who declined to be named, there were 71 initial
cholera patients as of Tuesday at the cholera centers.
