Rural outbreak of anthrax
-------------------------
In the partido [division] of Coronel Dorrego, Province of Buenos Aires, and
close to Laguna [a lake] de Sauce Grande, a cattle establishment suffered 4
sudden deaths of adult cattle with extravasation of blood from the natural
openings of the body, including their noses. The herd of mixed breed cattle
was in good health; the weather has been humid with high temperatures [it
is summer in Argentina. - Mod.MHJ]; and the cattle were on natural grazing.
[Unfortunately] the herd had not been vaccinated against anthrax. There is
no record of anthrax on this farm in the past 30 years.

The carcasses were handled in the standard manner by covering them in lime
and then a weighted down heavy duty plastic tarpaulin. Farm staff disposing
of the cattle did not handle them directly [that is, it was all done by
tractors. - Mod.MHJ]

[In a subsequent communication with this moderator about the apparent prior
absence of the disease on this estancia, Dr Noseda commented that the
partido of Coronel Dorrego has had 3 recorded outbreaks in the period
1977-2009 and the possibility of a water source involving runoff from the
Sierra de la Ventana and the Laguna de Sauce Grande. Water has the capacity
to force the hydrophobic spores to the soil surface. Unfortunately this is
a very speculative area in the absence of any hard data on specific grave
sites, flooding, erosion, and the incidence and locations of missed cases,
but anecdotally not uncommon. Our thanks to Ramon, as ever, for his report.
