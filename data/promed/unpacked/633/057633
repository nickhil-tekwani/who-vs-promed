The wheat stripe rust [WSR] pathogen, _Puccinia striiformis_ Westend. f.
sp. _tritici_(Pst), occurred on several experimental wheat (_Triticum
aestivum_ L.) lines planted at the North Florida Research and Education
Center in Quincy, Gadsden Co., FL in early February 2003. Several
experimental lines in the 2003 Advanced Wheat A (AWA), the Advanced Wheat B
(AWB), and the Uniform Southern Wheat Nursery (US) yield trials then showed
traces of WSR on leaves of plants. Diseased lines included: FL
K-R-7-1-G4-B27-C3 (AWA), FL K-R-7-1-G1-B21-C4 (AWA), FL 90192-W14-Y1-A7-C9
(AWB), FL8524-X7-V1-21-A4-B1-C (AWB), and NC98-26143 (US).
Field plots were 55 sq ft (5.11 sq m) and arranged in a randomized complete
block design with 2 replications. By April 2003, susceptible lines had
developed rust severity ranging from 80 to 100 percent, with infection on
leaves and leaf sheaths. WSR was prevalent throughout the plots, indicating
a uniform rust distribution.
Pst-infected leaf samples were analyzed for virulence factors and race
identification on a known set of wheat lines near-isogenic for single genes
for WSR resistance and differential genotypes currently used to
differentiate races of Pst in North America. An isolate collected from the
wheat line FL8524-X7-V1-21-A4-B1-C was classified as race PST-78 (virulent
on Lemhi, Heines VII, Lee, Fielder, Express, Yr8, Yr9, and Clement). The
isolate from wheat line FLK-R-7-1-GH-B27-C3 was identified as PST-80 with
virulence on the same differential genotypes as PST-78 plus Produra.
These 2 races were 1st isolated in 2000 from samples analyzed from the
south central U.S. (Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, etc.) and California. In
2001, PST-78 and PST-80 dominated rust populations prevalent in south
central and central states (i.e., Kansas, Nebraska, and South Dakota). By
2002, these races were prevalent throughout the U.S. (X. M. Chen,
unpublished data).
An isolate from wheat line NC98-26143 was identified as race PST-97 with
virulence on the same differential genotypes as PST-78 plus Stephens. An
isolate from wheat line 90192-W14-Y1-A7-C9 was identified as PST-98, which
has virulence on the same differential genotypes as PST-80 plus Stephens.
These 2 races were 1st detected in 2002 throughout the United States (X. M.
Chen, unpublished data). The 4 races (PST-78, PST-80, PST-97, and PST-98)
isolated from wheat lines in Florida also were commonly detected throughout
the U.S., especially in Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Georgia
in 2003 (X. M. Chen, unpublished data).
Pst only infects members of the _Poaceae_ family, with wheat and triticale
(X _Triticosecale_ Wittmack) being the primary hosts. Several wild grasses,
including wheatgrass (_Agropyron_ spp.), bromegrass (_Bromus_ spp.), and
Virginia wild rye (_Elymus virginicus_ L.), which are not commonly found in
Florida, are less important hosts. WSR is worldwide in distribution in wet
areas with cool temperatures, especially in mountainous and upland areas.
In the United States, WSR frequently occurs in western states like
California, Washington, Idaho, and Oregon.
In Florida, wheat is typically planted in late fall and harvested in late
spring. Most wheat grown in the state is used for livestock grazing or
wildlife forage plots, although some is milled for use in products
requiring soft red winter wheat. Wheat occupies approximately 10 000 acres
in the state (2002 Florida Agricultural Statistics).
An unusually cool and wet winter and spring encouraged a scattered outbreak
of WSR on susceptible experimental wheat lines.
This report constitutes the 1st documented case of WSR in Florida. Several
fungicides are registered by EPA for control of WSR, however, these
products may not be legal if wheat is grazed by livestock. If a fungicide
application is warranted, it should begin at the 1st sign of disease.

[Common bread wheat/spring wheat, _Triticum aestivum_ is typically planted
in Florida in late November to early December and harvested in late April
to May, predominantly in the panhandle counties. Wheat occupied ca. 10 000
acres in the 2003 growing season. Unusually cool and wet spring weather
encouraged a scattered outbreak of WSR on susceptible varieties. WSR was
1st noticed on experimental wheat lines planted by the Institute of Food
and Agricultural Sciences (IFAS) spring wheat breeder at North Florida
Research and Educational Center (NFREC) in Quincy, Florida in early
February 2003. Florida wheat breeders and growers have had little reason to
be concerned about this rust in the wheat cultivars grown in Florida. In
2004, WSR infections in the southern US were less severe and extensive than
last year and therefore will provide less inoculum for the northern wheat
growing area.
Yield losses can be severe if the rust appears at flag leaf (boot) or
anthesis stage, since the flag leaf is known to contribute 30-40 percent of
the grain filling (yield). Management of WSR in Florida is likely to be
minimal, but only time will tell. Disease management will depend upon use
of resistant varieties with multiple genes for both seedling and adult
plant resistance, applications of EPA-approved foliar systemic and contact
fungicides registered for WSR on wheat. If fungicides are warranted,
application should begin at the 1st sign of disease. A last resort would be
to remove wild hosts to reduce inoculum, especially that which over-winters.
