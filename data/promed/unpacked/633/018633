Orf Virus Infection in Humans --- New York, Illinois, California, and
Tennessee, 2004--2005
---------------------------------------------------
Orf virus is a zoonotic parapoxvirus endemic to most countries in the world
and is principally associated with small ruminants (e.g., sheep and goats).
Human orf infections appear as ulcerative skin lesions after contact with
an infected animal or contaminated fomite. This report summarizes the
epidemiologic and laboratory investigations of 4 sporadic cases of human
orf infection, emphasizing the temporal association between human lesions
and skin trauma or recent flock vaccination with live orf vaccine. This
zoonotic infection shares clinical manifestations and exposure risks with
other potentially life-threatening zoonoses (e.g., cutaneous anthrax) and
is likely under-recognized because of a lack of clinical suspicion and
widely available diagnostics. Barrier precautions and proper hand hygiene
are recommended for the prevention of orf virus infection in humans.
Case 1
----
On 1 Mar 2004 a woman aged 51 years from upstate New York noted an area of
erythema approximately 4 mm in diameter on the middle finger of her right
hand. During the next several days, the lesion evolved into a clear,
solitary vesicle with surrounding erythema. On 12 Mar, she visited her
family physician, who prescribed penicillin and warm water soaks. The
patient did not recall any trauma, including animal bites, although she
regularly cared for goats on her family farm. She reported having
bottle-fed a kid goat with a sore on its mouth approximately 1 week before
the appearance of the lesion.
The patient did not improve and, on 15 Mar, she went to a local hospital.
The lesion on her finger had progressed to 2 cm in diameter with a 3-4 mm
central white ring and umbilication. Her examination was otherwise
unremarkable. At the hospital, the ulcer was debrided and a
serous/gelatinous material was extracted. Routine bacterial cultures were
negative. The patient was treated empirically with ciprofloxacin and
amoxicillin-clavulanate.
On 22 Mar 2004, after discussion with local veterinarians, she contacted
the New York State Department of Health to inquire about diagnostics for
orf virus infection. Specimens collected on 15 Mar were forwarded to CDC
and determined to be positive at both genus (_Parapoxvirus_) and species
(_Orf virus_) level by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR); standard
PCR (i.e., visualization of amplicons by gel electrophoresis) (1) for genus
and species were negative. By 1 Apr, the lesion had spontaneously healed
without scarring. No other family members or farm attendants reported
similar skin lesions.
Case 2
-----
In May 2004, an adolescent boy aged 16 years was bitten on the left hand by
a healthy-appearing sheep that he was grooming for a county fair in
southwestern Illinois. The sheep had been vaccinated against orf virus 1
week before the patient was bitten. 3 weeks after he sustained the bite,
the patient went to his primary-care physician with 3 nonpruritic, painless
vesicular lesions on his left thumb, the largest of which was 1.5 cm in
diameter. 2 lesions were eroded vesicles with an erythematous base and
white halo [illustrated by a photograph in the original text]; the
remaining periungual lesion around the nail was still intact. The patient
reported no constitutional symptoms, and the rest of his physical
examination was unremarkable. Skin from the unroofed vesicle and dry swabs
of material from the ulcer beds were submitted to CDC to confirm the
diagnosis of orf virus infection. Both real-time PCR and standard PCR were
positive in genus- and species-specific assays, confirmi!
ng the diagnosis of orf virus infection. No treatment was administered, and
the lesions healed spontaneously after 2 months. The sheep was removed from
the county fair once the orf infection was evident, and active case finding
failed to reveal other orf infections in county fair staff or attendees.
Case 3
-----
On 28 Jul 2004, a man aged 51 years from Sonoma County, California, was
referred to an infectious diseases physician because of pruritic, painless
vesicles on his left hand. He had onset of these lesions 10 days after
shearing young sheep, which had been purchased recently at auction and
vaccinated with the live orf vaccine. The patient noted that some of the
sheep had ulcers on their oral mucosa. He also recalled cutting his skin on
thistles and burs embedded in the sheep wool. He reported no constitutional
symptoms. His physical examination was only remarkable for 5 bullae
(vesicles >1 cm in diameter), 1.0-1.5 cm in diameter, on the back of both
hands. A punch biopsy specimen of one lesion was sent to the Santa Rosa
Kaiser Medical Center Pathology Department, and serum was submitted to the
California State Health Department Laboratory for further testing.
Histopathology indicated nonspecific inflammation, but serologic evaluation
revealed parapoxvirus IgM >1:160 and IgG of 1!
:512, consistent with current or recent parapoxvirus infection. All lesions
healed spontaneously within 2 weeks.
Case 4.
------
On 25 May 2005, a girl aged 11 years was taken to her pediatrician in
Nashville, Tennessee, with a 7-mm papulovesicular lesion on the 4th finger
of her left hand. 10 days before this visit, her family had vaccinated
their sheep against orf virus. 5 days before her clinic visit, she had cut
the same finger on a lamb harness. The remainder of her physical
examination was unremarkable. The lesion was lanced in clinic, producing 3
cc of bloody discharge that was submitted to CDC for evaluation of orf
virus infection. While laboratory results were pending, the patient was
treated with amoxicillin-clavulanate twice a day for 10 days. Real-time PCR
performed at CDC confirmed the presence of orf virus using both genus- and
species-specific primers, and standard PCR assays were negative for both
primer sets. The lesion healed spontaneously within 1 month. No other
family members reported similar lesions to the attending physician.

MMWR Editorial Note
-------------------
Although orf virus infection is self-limiting in hosts with normal immune
systems, it can resemble skin lesions associated with potentially
life-threatening zoonotic infections such as tularemia, cutaneous anthrax,
and erysipeloid (2); therefore, rapid and definitive diagnosis is critical.
Tularemia and erysipeloid are generally associated with exposure to rabbits
or New World sylvan rodents and swine, respectively. Both orf virus
infection and naturally acquired anthrax in humans can result from exposure
to domestic sheep and goats; thus, exposure history alone (i.e., animal
contact) is insufficient to indicate etiology, necessitating laboratory
evaluation. Histopathologic features include intraepithelial ballooning
and intracytoplasmic inclusions (3); however, these findings are suggestive
and not pathognomonic.
Negative-stain electron microscopy can confirm a parapoxvirus infection by
demonstrating classic ovoid cross-hatched virions [illustrated by an
electromicrograph in the original text] but cannot distinguish orf virus
from other parapoxviruses such as paravaccinia (pseudocowpox) virus;
serologic testing has the same limitation. Only PCR can definitively
identify a parapoxvirus as orf virus. 2 assays have been used by CDC:
standard PCR (1) and real-time PCR. Cases 1 and 4 described in this report
demonstrate the increased sensitivity of the newer real-time PCR technique
(nearly 1000 times more sensitive than standard PCR) (Y. Li, PhD, CDC,
personal communication, November 2005). This high level of sensitivity has
been observed for other poxvirus real-time PCR assays validated by CDC (4).
These assays are ideally performed on frozen tissue specimens, vesicle
material, or scab debris.
Transmission of orf virus to humans occurs after contact with infected or
recently vaccinated animals and/or fomites in conjunction with skin trauma.
Orf virus vaccine strains have been known to cause outbreaks among sheep
(5), and 3 of the illnesses described in this report occurred soon after
vaccination of the flock. Veterinary vaccines for orf virus use
non-attenuated, live virus preparations and are intended to produce
controlled infections in flocks (6). Recently vaccinated animals pose an
occupational risk to humans (7). Infections in 3 of the 4 cases described
in this report were temporally associated with orf virus vaccination;
however, the vaccines used to inoculate the animals in question were not
available for genetic comparison with patient isolates.
3 of the 4 cases described in this report were associated with concurrent
skin trauma; orf virus infection is facilitated by skin trauma (8), and
previous case series have associated skin trauma with orf virus infection
(3). Trivial injury (e.g., pricks from thistle) or substantial trauma
(e.g., bites) can facilitate transmission of orf virus. Therefore, barrier
protection (e.g., nonporous gloves) and hand washing during the care of
sheep and goats is recommended whenever feasible. These measures are
especially important for any person with a compromised immune system or a
chronic skin disorder (e.g., eczema) who has contact with overtly infected
animals. Immunocompromised persons should discuss the risks of handling
orf-infected animals and infection-prevention strategies with their
primary-care physicians.
Human orf virus infection is a common yet preventable consequence of
contact with sheep and goats. Persons who are most likely to be exposed to
orf virus (e.g., farm workers) might be familiar with the infection and
thus might not seek medical attention. As a result, clinicians might not be
familiar with orf virus infections, leading to a delay in diagnosis and
unnecessary antibiotic use. Public health personnel should be cognizant
that orf virus infection is similar in appearance and risk factors to
life-threatening infections such as cutaneous anthrax and that skin trauma
is a predisposing factor to infection. In addition, immunocompromised
patients can have progressive, destructive lesions requiring medical
interventions such as antiviral therapy (9) and surgical debridement (10).
The relation between vaccination of sheep and goats for orf virus and
subsequent human orf virus infection should be considered in future public
health investigations. Barrier precautions and prop!
er hand hygiene are recommended for the prevention of orf virus infection
in humans. Upon request, definitive diagnostic testing for orf virus is
available at CDC, telephone 404-639-4129.
