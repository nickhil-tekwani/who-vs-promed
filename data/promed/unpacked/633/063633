[We're happy to relay the following communication we received from Dr.
Michael Baker, on cases of dengue imported to New Zealand in 1997 to date.
This message is to be read in the context of the recent PACNET warnings
regarding the increased activity of dengue-like fever in the Pacific
Islands, [and in Samoa in particular.
In thanking Dr. Baker for his contribution to PACNET and the PPHSN, we wish
to emphasise the following positive aspects:
1. [The information is accurate, and fully consistent with what has been
documented on PACNET regarding regional dengue activity this year.
2. [The information is based on the findings of cases investigation;
timely case investigation is a key activity [that PACNET wants to actively
promote and facilitate for the improvement of public health surveillance in
the Pacific islands.
3. It provides a very good illustration of the value of networking
complementary information from various sources, on communicable disease
occurrence.
We would be happy to hear other PACNET member's reactions - YS

As you probably know, we have a few dengue fever cases imported each year
into New Zealand. The numbers increased last year, with 23 cases. In the
first nine months of this year we had 11 cases.
Details of the cases we have had this year are listed in the [following
table.
Dengue Fever Notifications January - September 1997
Case
No. Age Sex Ethnicity Onset Health district Traveled to Reason diagnosis
1. 16 M European 8-1-97 Central Auckland Tahiti holiday Lab.
2. 19 F Tahitian 10-3-97 NW Auckland Tahiti unknown Lab.
3. 46 F European 1-5-97 South Auckland Rarotonga holiday Clinical
4. 58 M European 1-5-97 South Auckland Rarotonga holiday Clinical
5. 40 M European 1-5-97 Wellington Cook Isles holiday Lab.
6. 50 M European 2-5-97 Otago Rarotonga unknown Lab.

8. 20 M European 5-19-97 Southland Tahiti, sports event Lab.
9. 5 M European 5-19-97 Waikato Cook Isles holiday Lab.
10. 47 F Unknown 5-6-97 Waikato Australia holiday Lab.
11. 53 M European 3-9-97 Central Auckland Samoa holiday Lab.
Six of 11 cases seen so far in 1997 were linked to travel to the Cook
Islands. All were [reported in May. Other sources were Tahiti,
Australia, and Samoa.
The case linked to Samoa is the most recent, having an onset date of 3
September.
I have two questions:
1. Are these source countries plausible, based on your knowledge of the
distribution of dengue fever in the Pacific region?
2. Are there ways we could use these date more effectively to support
regional dengue fever surveillance?
[If anyone has data sufficient to answer these questions from Dr. Baker,
please reply to us and we will disseminate them. Information regarding the
exact dengue virus would be appreciated. -Mod. CHC
