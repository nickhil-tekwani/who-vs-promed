Nurse TR leaves Madrid, Spain, hospital after recovering from Ebola
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A Spanish nurse who was the 1st person to catch Ebola outside Africa has left a Madrid hospital after recovering from her illness. TR was diagnosed with Ebola on 6 Oct 2014. She told reporters today [5 Nov 2014] that she thought she was going to die when she was 1st diagnosed and she paid tribute to the doctors and nurses who cared for her. "I was isolated and my only contact with the outside world was through the phone in my room [and the professionals on the staff]."

TR was treated with human serum containing antibodies from Ebola survivors and anti-virals. She was declared Ebola-free on 21 Oct 2014 although she remained in hospital until she became stronger. Doctors said they could not be sure if the medication which they gave TR had been responsible for her recovery. "In the absence of a control group, it is difficult to know what worked for our patient," said Marta Arsuaga, one of the doctors who have been working round the clock treating her.

Spain tightened its Ebola control measures after complaints that included inadequate training and protective suits that were too small for some medical workers. The changes include close monitoring of the people with whom TR came into contact and more thorough training. The government also lowered the temperature at which a fever serves as a red flag of possible Ebola virus [infection].

[2] USA: government wants to patent the Ebola virus

U.S. government researchers are embroiled in a 5-year fight with the US Patent and Trademark office for a patent on [an ebolavirus]. Though the effort sounds ominous, it could accelerate the pace of research into an Ebola vaccine by preventing pharmaceutical companies from monopolizing the field.

Through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], the U.S. government often seeks patents on viruses and their genetic material in an effort to research the diseases safely. If awarded a patent, the agency would make the material available for public use, which private companies aren't as likely to do. "If a company patents it, they could limit access," said Robert Stoll, former U.S. Patent and Trademark commissioner, currently an attorney at Drinker Biddle & Reath LLP. "[The government] could donate it to the public." It's happened before. The CDC holds a patent on the SARS virus from more than a decade ago. "The whole purpose of the patent is to prevent folks from controlling the technology," it said at the time. "This is being done to give the industry and other researchers reasonable access to the samples." ... -- more

[Indonesia's decision to withhold samples of avian influenza virus A (H5N1) from the World Health Organization for much of 2007 caused a crisis in global health -- see http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/14/1/07-0700_article. The reason given was that Western pharmaceutical companies would patent drugs based on the viruses recovered that would be too expensive for developing countries to afford. This article goes into detail about all the legal arguments why no living thing can be patented. Not even a dead virus can be patented "because dead viruses exist in nature". - Mod.JW]

[3] Worldwide: lack of ebolavirus samples for research

Ebola researchers requesting access to virus samples
--------------------------------------------------------------
Ebola researchers from the USA are saying they are unable to obtain samples of Ebola virus making it harder for them to study and understand the virus. Without a sample, researchers are also saying that it would be harder to find a cure against it. Apparently, the lack of Ebola virus samples is due to growing caution by regulators and transport companies in handling Ebola specimens. The limited resource from West Africa is also another reason according to researchers.

Reuters have contacted 10 scientists that are currently working on Ebola and they all said they were unable to find any Ebola virus sample. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], transporting a live specimen of the Ebola virus is challenging. So far, only Tulane University has got a sample of the virus from the CDC.

As scientists try to understand this Ebola virus, they need to have constant supply of it. If there are any changes, they need to know so they can incorporate them with the vaccine or cure that they are trying to make. Apparently, with the short of supply of live specimens, it means delays on the development of vaccine and cure as well. One research institution that is in need of a live specimen of Ebola virus is microbiologists and infectious disease expert Dr. Charles Chiu. Dr. Chiu is currently trying to develop a new genetic test that aims to detect Ebola infection prior to the development of symptoms. Another individual working on developing a cure against Ebola is Erica Ollmann Saphire of the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California. She is one of the developers of ZMapp. She is continuously working on finding a cure for Ebola and she has been requesting a special cell from Ebola survivors but hasn't received any response yet. The CDC promised that it will do its best to acquire live specimens in a matter of weeks according to CDC spokesman Tom Skinner.

Ebola in America: By the numbers
---------------------------------------
A snapshot of how Ebola has played out in the United States since 1 Aug 2014:

9 patients: 5 cases were diagnosed overseas. Of the 4 U.S.-diagnosed cases, 2 involved transmission [in the USA].

One death: Liberian national Thomas Eric Duncan, the "index case" in Dallas [Texas], died on 8 Oct 2014.

One current hospitalization: physician CS, who became ill after returning from volunteer medical duty in Guinea, continues to improve at Bellevue Hospital Center in New York.

4 quarantine orders: Officials in Texas, New York, New Jersey and Maine have executed orders to quarantine at least 7 individuals. Nurse KH went to court to overturn hers.

60 diagnostic tests: Of the untold number of people to show up at hospitals nationwide with symptoms of potential concern, CDC has run diagnostic tests on about 60. It has had 4 positive findings [Duncan, CS, and 2 nurses].

7 schools closed: Districts in Texas and Ohio closed 7 schools for at least a day in October [2014] because of concerns over potential exposure to Ebola -- in one case because a staff member might have ridden on the same Frontier Airlines plane, although not at the same time, as a Dallas nurse who subsequently became ill.

More than 1200 airport screenings: In the 1st 3 weeks of intensified traveler scrutiny at 5 U.S. airports, 1249 passengers were referred for enhanced screening. Of those, 62 underwent a CDC health assessment; 4 had elevated temperatures; 8 were taken to medical facilities for additional evaluation [including 4 who did not have elevated temperatures? Why? - Mod.JW].

Hundreds of travelers monitored: In New York alone, 357 people were under active monitoring as of Wednesday [5 Nov 2014]. "The vast majority of these individuals are travelers arriving in New York City within the past 21 days from the 3 Ebola-affected countries," according to the city's health department.

30 scientists missing: Nearly 3 dozen experts who were expected at the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene's meeting this week in New Orleans [Louisiana] were told not to come because they'd been in an Ebola-affected country within the past 21 days -- the full incubation period for the viral disease. Louisiana officials said the scientists would be confined to their hotel rooms if they tried to attend the meeting.
