Cholera situation in Haiti, 1 Jan-15 Apr 2017
---------------------------------------------
From 1 Jan 2017 to 15 Apr 2017, the MSPP [Ministry of Public Health and Population] registered 5095 suspected cholera cases and 69 related deaths, in comparison to the 12 536 suspected cases and 134 deaths for the same period in 2016. This downward trend, if maintained, is an opportunity to take this year [2017] a big step towards the elimination of the transmission, in case funding is available and rapid response is accordingly intensified. As of 31 Dec 2016, Haitian and international efforts have succeeded in reducing the cholera cases and fatalities in Haiti by almost 88 per cent since the peak in 2011 (350 000 cases).

However, the country is still extremely vulnerable to cholera, particularly in the West, Centre, Artibonite, and North departments. Furthermore, the impending rainy season represents an additional risk. Even though the number of cases remains lower than in 2016, support to the Ministry of Health remains crucial to strengthen investigations and the rapid response to specific cases, as well as to reinforce the activities under the umbrella of the National Plan for the Elimination of Cholera.

Year / Cases / Total deaths / Incidence (per 1000) / Fatality rate in hospitals [expressed in percentages]
2010 / 185 351 / 3951 / 18.36 / 2.43
2011 / 351 839 / 2918 / 34.33 / 1.04
2012 / 101 503 / 908 / 9.73 / 0.96
2013 / 58 574 / 581 / 5.57 / 1.05
2014 / 29 078 / 297 / 2.71 / 1.01
2015 / 36 045 / 322 / 3.9 / 0.75
2016 / 41 421 / 447 / 3.74 / 0.91
2017 (1 Jan-15 Apr) / 5095 / 69 / 0.42 / 1.10
----------------------------------------------
Total 807 414 / 9493

Funding overview and response 2010-2017
---------------------------------------
For 2017, as of 24 Apr 2017, the UN has mobilized more than USD 17.7 million for the cholera response in Haiti through different instruments, such as the Cholera Response Multi-Partner Trust Fund (USD 2.6 million) and the Humanitarian Response Plan (mainly though UNICEF and PAHO/WHO). Between October 2010 and April 2017, the UN family in Haiti has supported the Haitian authorities mobilizing more than USD 350 million for both for rapid response and for longer term response (including more than 300 direct initiatives and projects).

[It is encouraging that the cases of cholera are decreased so far in 2017 for the comparable time in 2016. This may represent a combination of more access to safe water and the use of cholera vaccine. - Mod.LL
