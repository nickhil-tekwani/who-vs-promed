A cow and a calf affected in a small family herd in Stroiesti,
starting on 6 Dec 2007 and confirmed on 17 Dec 2007 by the County
Sanitary Veterinary Laboratory in Suceava; reported to OIE on 27 Dec
2007. The other animals in the herd have been vaccinated. At this
time the source of infection is unknown.

The last reported case of anthrax was in 2006.

[To find Suceava, in northeastern Romania, go to
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/RO/34/Suceava.html>. A map of the
country is available at
<http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/romania.pdf>.

Anthrax is sporadic in Romania and while it has been reported in the
full range of susceptible livestock, reports are now only of cases in
cattle, thanks to a vigorous cross-species vaccination programme.
From 2001 to 2005 there were 8, 5, 2, 6, and 3 cattle outbreaks
reported to OIE; data for 2006 is missing.

Anthrax in calves is unusual. I would expect that it probably died of
starvation when its mother died, compounded by not having been
isolated from her mother's carcass in an inadequate stable.

Considering the winter climate in northern Romania it may be presumed
that this cow was infected as a result of contaminated feed, probably
hay. If it were from a commercial feed supplement we can expect
further cases. - Mod MHJ]
