A total of 4 more cases of the potentially fatal _Escherichia coli_ O157 bacterium [8 since ProMED-mail's last report - Mod.LL] have been linked to food sold at Glasgow's Hydro venue. Health officials said there were now 15 cases linked to burgers consumed at events between 17 and 25 Jan 2014. All of the victims are recovering at home.

The cases are from health board areas in Glasgow, Lanarkshire, Lothian, Highland, Forth Valley, and Cumbria. Anyone who attended the venue recently, and who feels unwell, is asked to contact their GP. Symptoms to look out for include stomach cramps [often severe - Mod.LL], diarrhea (often bloody), nausea, and fever [but usually minimal - Mod.LL].

NHS [National Health Service] Greater Glasgow and Clyde (GGC) said possible links to other food sold at The Hydro were also being investigated. Dr Eleanor Anderson, consultant in public health medicine at NHS GGC said: "We are pleased that all the cases are recovering at home. Investigations are ongoing, and while there is no conclusive evidence, our investigations have indicated that there may be a link to the consumption of burgers at the SSE Hydro. Glasgow City Council environmental health officers are working closely with the vendors to ensure all appropriate food hygiene standards are being met."

[The following discussion is from a chapter on EHEC in a forthcoming book (Lutwick LI. Enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ infections. In: Confronting emerging zoonoses: the One Health paradigm. Yamada A, Kahn LH, Kaplan B, Monath TP, Woodall J, Conti LA (eds). Tokyo, Japan: Springer, in press):

"The incubation period of EHEC O157:H7 infection ranges from 2 to 12 days, so it may be substantially longer than other _E. coli_ and different enteric infections with the exception of typhoid fever. Bell et al. (1) has reported a mean incubation period of 3.7 days. In most cases, the initial diarrhea is non-bloody for up to 3 days, not associated with significant fever or abundant stool leukocytes. The peripheral blood leukocyte count is often elevated and the affected individuals may complain of substantial abdominal pain. The pathophysiology of this initial diarrhea may not be related to Shiga toxin as _E. coli_ O157 strains that are inherently Shiga toxin negative can produce watery diarrhea (2).

"Bloody diarrhea subsequently begins in as many as 90 percent of symptomatic infections, sometimes with almost all blood and little diarrhea. Bloody stools are often the reason to present for medical care. Although normal human intestinal lining cells do not express the Gb3 receptor for Shiga toxin, the toxin does translocate to cause damage to the mucosa, resulting in bloody diarrhea and enters the bloodstream to reach susceptible vascular epithelium of target organs (3). The combination of afebrile patients with watery diarrhea and significant abdominal pain should alert the clinician to the possibility of EHEC infection, even before the onset of bloody diarrhea. Imaging studies of the colon may show a thumbprinting appearance and thickening of the colon wall suggestive of either colonic ischemia or pseudomembranous colitis. Indeed, in retrospect, some cases of colonic ischemia may have been caused by EHEC (4). Vascular injury causing peripheral edema and decreased platelet counts are common during this phase of illness; neither sign predicts the development of HUS [hemolytic uremic syndrome]. During the usual gastrointestinal phase, clinical signs of systemic inflammation are not present, the individuals are not febrile, hypotensive, or acidotic. Quite mild or asymptomatic infections with EHEC occur and may serve as a reservoir for secondary cases. Cases of HUS have been reported in patients without diarrhea but are found to have EHEC in their stool (5). The length of EHEC shedding in the stool is typically 10-20 days, generally to be shorter in adults and asymptomatic individuals. Chronic carriage is rare but may be a cause of chronic diarrhea (6)."
