CDC CYCLOSPORA RESEARCH PROJECT TERMINATED BY GUATEMALA
George Jackson, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration scientist, stressed how
little is known about _Cyclospora_. Questions still outnumber answers," he
said, elaborating: "We do not know why it causes illness seasonally, where
it survives between seasons, how it contaminates the produce incriminated
in outbreaks, nor what are its inactivation parameters. Lack of a
high-yield culture system or hosts other than primates has restricted
research and limited control options."
"Has _Cyclospora_ become endemic in the United States and Canada (as well
as Latin America)?" Jackson asked. "What are the vectors? Are there
reservoir hosts? The infective dose seems to be low, but we don't know."
Jackson reported some progress in methods development, adding that sampling
remains a problem. He acknowledged that FDA has been unable to detect
_Cyclospora_ on berries, probably because of sampling problems. "It's
difficult to obtain samples actually involved in an outbreak. We're usually
sampling subsequent shipments. We have found _Eimeria_, a related organism,
so the test method has some use. Something from animal feces is getting on
these berries."
During discussion, Jackson reported that epidemiologists from the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were "kicked out" by Guatemalan
authorities in July after finding _Cyclospora_ in children of raspberry
pickers. The presence of asymptomatic _Cyclospora_ infection implies
acquired immunity to the disease, he said. [And also the feces may be
coming from the pickers themselves. -- RAL
Ynes Ortega, a Peruvian scientist based at the University of Arizona, USA,
reviewed studies of 6,000 children in a Lima, Peru, shantytown. Both
_Cryptosporidium_ and _Cyclospora_ are widely present among shantytown
dwellers, but many infections are asymptomatic, she said, suggesting that
children acquire immunity to the pathogens after age 12. She disputed the
notion that _Cyclospora_ thrives in the early spring rainy season, noting
that Lima has a desert climate.
"We don't really know what's going on with _Cyclospora_ in the United
States," Ortega said. "Few states report it." Outlining difficulties in
environmental sampling, she cited lack of enrichment methods and
uncertainties about sample size, infectious dose, and type of suspected
produce.
"Produce is a route of contamination, but it's probably not the main route
in Peru," Ortega reported. "Produce is washed and cooked, and people drink
boiled water. Cyclospora infection is found in the desert but not the
jungle part of Peru. Why Lima but not the Andes? Our problem is figuring
out how the infection occurs. Your problem is knowing that your produce is
clean."
Karen Jinneman, another FDA researcher, outlined a nested PCR procedure
that amplifies a region of the 18S rRNA gene to detect _Cyclospora_.
Testing of food and environmental samples requires the ability to rapidly
identify _Cyclospora_ and distinguish it from closely related _Eimeria_,
which do not infect humans, she said.
Jinneman reported problems in template preparation for PCR. Because sample
enrichment methods are of no use for organisms that do not multiply,
technicians wash samples to remove and concentrate oocysts, with a 10-30%
recovery. She added that oocysts are difficult to break open to get to the
DNA. It's also hard to remove or attenuate PCR inhibitors, she said.
