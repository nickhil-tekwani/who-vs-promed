One of a group of sheep of the genotype most resistant to scrapie is
reported to have developed disease following an artificial challenge with
cattle BSE, Defra said today. Research results are to be published in the
near future.
The ongoing work is being conducted by the Institute for Animal Health,
Compton, Berkshire, on behalf of Defra. One sheep with the PrP genotype
code ARR/ARR is reported to have succumbed to spongiform encephalopathy
following inoculation of brain material from a BSE-infected cow.
BSE has been transmitted to sheep in previous experiments, but if this
result is independently confirmed it will be the first time a TSE has been
transmitted to a sheep of this genotype.
The inoculation route is experimental, directly into brain tissue of the
anaesthetized sheep, and does not represent a known route of natural infection.
The research project has involved inoculating a number of sheep of various
genotypes imported from New Zealand with cattle BSE brain homogenate. These
groups are under observation and the collective results will be published
in scientific papers as they develop.
Animal Health Minister Elliot Morley stressed that the possibility of BSE
being present naturally in sheep remained no more than a theoretical
possibility. "It has been known for some time that sheep can be infected
with BSE under experimental conditions. So this result, if confirmed, will
tell us nothing more than we already know about the possibility of BSE in
the national flock. If confirmed, however, this new result will be the
first time that a sheep of the ARR/ARR genotype will be independently
confirmed as having developed a TSE. As the ARR/ARR genotype is regarded as
being the one that has the most resistance to TSEs, I have asked the
Government's Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) to advise
on whether the research result, if confirmed, has any implications for the
Government's National Scrapie Plan."
"The NSP's core aim is to eliminate TSEs by breeding for genetic
resistance. A sub-group of SEAC is meeting to consider this early next
month," he said.
Intracerebral infection is not a natural route of transmission for TSEs,
and it remains the case that no ARR/ARR sheep has been reported as having
developed a TSE in natural (non-experimental) conditions. In experimental
work to date sheep of the ARR/ARR genotype have so far proved resistant to
BSE when fed infected cattle material by the more natural oral route. In an
ongoing Veterinary Laboratories Agency experiment, which has yet to be
completed, sheep of the resistant ARR/ARR and susceptible ARQ/ARQ genotypes
were each fed 5 grams of infected brain material about 5 years ago. To
date, no BSE infectivity has been detected in the ARR/ARR genotypes,
whereas ARQ/ARQ sheep showed infectivity in some tissues from as early as 4
months.
Defra will continue to operate the NSP as normal pending advice from SEAC.
Defra will then review the situation in the light of the advice, and in
consultation with the devolved administrations.
Defra will present its findings to the European Commission's Standing
Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health (SCoFCAH) meeting later tomorrow.
Notes for editors
1. The Defra-funded experiment at the Institute for Animal Health (IAH) was
set up to check whether scrapie-free sheep of different genotypes imported
from New Zealand for TSE research were susceptible to BSE and scrapie.
Sheep were imported from New Zealand because it is recognised as being free
of scrapie by both the EU and the World Animal Health Organisation.
2. The index case was one of a group of 19 New Zealand ARR/ARR sheep
inoculated intracerebrally with cattle BSE brain homogenate. It was culled
after an incubation period of 33.5 months, about twice the average
incubation period of 18.5 months seen in the more susceptible scrapie
genotype ARQ/ARQ sheep challenged with BSE in the same study. To date 17
out of the 19 ARQ/ARQ sheep have succumbed to BSE.
3. IAH, who carried out the experiment, have had the genotype independently
verified. Western blots (a biochemical diagnostic test) on the brain
material indicate the presence of BSE, and the Veterinary Laboratory Agency
(VLA) has confirmed that a prion protein accumulation in the suspect brain
is typical of BSE and distinct from that of UK scrapie cases tested so far.
4. The work is currently being prepared for publication in a scientific
journal. As part of this process the work will be subjected to independent
peer review, during which the result will be fully assessed for its validity.
5. The National Scrapie Plan for Great Britain (NSP) involves a voluntary,
long-term programme of breeding for genetic resistance. It encourages
participating flock owners to breed from and use scrapie-resistant sheep.
Since the NSP was launched in July 2001, about 260 000 sheep have been
genotyped. There have been over 11 000 expressions of intent to join the
NSP, and there are now 7000 member flocks.
6. Of 1715 confirmed GB scrapie cases since 1998 that have been genotyped,
none have been of the resistant ARR/ARR genotype, in line with
expectations. There have been just 8 cases (0.5 percent) in the
semi-resistant genotypes (containing ARR/X not VRQ), 22 percent in the
intermediate genotypes, and 77 percent in the most susceptible
(VRQ-containing) genotypes.
7. Recent data mainly from the sheep abattoir scrapie survey (4400 tests)
indicate that the approximate genotype distribution in the GB flock as a
whole is resistant (ARR/ARR) 21 percent, semi-resistant (ARR/X not VRQ) 41
percent, intermediate (no ARR or VRQ) 26 percent, and susceptible
(VRQ-containing) 12 percent.

'BSE-resistant' sheep succumbs to disease in lab test
-----------------------------------------------------
Plans to protect Britain's 40 million sheep from BSE-like diseases have
suffered a potentially serious setback after a sheep supposedly resistant
to such conditions was reported to have been infected in a laboratory test.
The sheep succumbed more than 33 months after being injected in the brain
with brain material from a BSE-contaminated cow. Further tests are being
done to confirm the diagnosis, but it appears the first time such disease
has been caused, albeit artificially, in a sheep of this type. Others with
less genetic resistance have succumbed far more rapidly.
Government agencies yesterday insisted that lamb and mutton could still be
eaten safely by consumers, since the risk of infection happening naturally
in breeding or food flocks remained theoretical. Resistant sheep fed
BSE-infected brain (rather than having it injected) had not succumbed to
the disease, even though some with low genetic resistance had shown signs
of BSE within 4 months.
Nevertheless, the long-term national programme to force farmers to replace
stock with inbred resistance to these diseases within 10 years could be
undermined if further cases occurred. So far about a fifth of British sheep
are resistant to a BSE-like disease called scrapie, which is thought to
affect about 10 000 sheep a year but has never been known to be harmful to man.
The government hopes to quickly make more than 8 in 10 lambs and sheep
genetically resistant, in the belief they will also be resistant to BSE,
which most scientists now accept did transfer to humans through their food.
It has allocated GBP 120 million to the first 3 years of the programme.
The French government may be tempted by the news to step up its attempts to
make all EU countries, including Britain, follow its example and from
January 2003 remove more potentially infected material from sheep as a
precaution in case BSE is ever found in flocks in the field. The experiment
that uncovered the uncomfortable result is being conducted at the Institute
of Animal Health in Compton, Berkshire, for the Department of the
Environment. The sheep was one of 19 resistant to scrapie that had been
imported from New Zealand, a country free from the disease.
Elliot Morley, the animal health minister, tried to reassure the public and
farmers yesterday. "It has been known for some time that sheep can be
infected with BSE under experimental conditions. So this result, if
confirmed, will tell us nothing more than we already know about the
possibility of BSE in the national flock. All it has done is confirm the
theoretical risk of BSE remains. There is no reason people should not buy
any sheep meat. Nothing has changed in that."
It would still be important for farmers that scrapie itself was bred out of
their sheep, whether or not that brought benefits in BSE protection, Mr
Morley said. He revealed that the one resistant sheep that succumbed had
taken nearly twice as long as the average 18 months in which sheep more
susceptible to scrapie had become infected. Of 19 injected in this group,
17 had developed BSE. In addition, sheep with little resistance had gone
down with BSE after being fed infected brain.

[The (theoretical) risk of BSE infecting sheep and goats, with their
potential of becoming a public health hazard, has urged the EU to launch a
TSE testing programme of sheep and goats over 18 months of age. The
programme has become operational in most EU member-states since April 2002.
It includes random testing of healthy animals at slaughter and of farm
fallen stock. As of August 2002, 121 863 sheep and 21 134 goats were tested
in 14 member states, with 567 positive sheep and 15 positive goats
detected. The positive sheep were detected in the UK (312), France (88),
Italy (42), Ireland (41), Greece (33), Spain (30), Germany (20) and Belgium
(1). Positive goats were detected in France (11), Greece and Italy (2 goats
each). Recently, this survey has led to the first detection of TSE in
Finland, in a goat (see ref). The number of sheep and goats to be tested
during 2003 is about 550 000. The population in 15 member-states is
estimated at over 66 million adult sheep and 8.5 million adult goats. - Mod.AS]
