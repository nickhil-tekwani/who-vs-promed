Genetic resistance to the rabbit calici virus [rabbit hemorrhagic disease
virus, a calicivirus has not been ruled out by one of Victoria's top
vertebrate researchers.
Fears of inbuilt resistance have surfaced with reports of increasing
numbers of rabbits in parts of the State.
Vertebrate Pest Manager with Victoria's Department of Natural Resources and
Environment, Tim Bloomfield, says it is very difficult to assess.
There may be some degrees of genetic resistance but it is very difficult to
tell what level that might be at, mostly because when you get rabbits in
older age groups not dying, it appears that it may be genetic resistance
and it may be other variables in relation to the virus too.

[This is one of the worst written series of one sentence paragraphs I have
ever seen. Doesn't say much either. Allow me to translate (and read into it
a bit) from the Australian: In spite of the Chicken Littles who thought
"the sky was falling" when this virus (incorrectly called "rabbit
calicivirus" in certain circles) was first released, rabbit hemorrhagic
disease virus and its host are acting pretty much the way one would expect
a virus and its host to act. The virus has not spread to companion animals
(unless one considers a rabbit a companion) and certainly not to humans.
Rabbits might be developing resistance to this virus, which will be the
death knoll of the control program by this method. For a parallel, read any
of the glorious work by Frank Fenner on myxoma virus of rabbits. Different
virus, same story. You cannot fool Mother Nature -- for long. - Mod. CHC
