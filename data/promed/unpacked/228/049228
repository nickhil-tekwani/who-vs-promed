[1] MSF: French worker infected
Date: 17 Sep 2014

The international medical humanitarian organisation Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) confirms that one of its international staff members in Liberia has been diagnosed with Ebola hemorrhagic fever. The French MSF staff member currently on assignment in Monrovia was placed in isolation on Tue 16 Sep 2014 after she developed a fever. Laboratory tests performed on the same day confirmed an EVD infection. Following MSF medical evacuation procedures, she will be soon transferred to a specialised treatment center in France.

"MSF applies very strict protocols of protection for its staff before, during and after their time in a country affected by the current EVD outbreak," said Brice de le Vingne, MSF Director of Operations. "This dramatically reduces the risk of transmission of the disease. However, the risk is part of such an intervention, and, sadly, our teams are not spared." The circumstances under which the contamination took place have not been determined at this time. This is being investigated by MSF teams under the standard management procedures for such events.

For reasons of medical confidentiality and to preserve the privacy of its staff member and her family, MSF will not provide any further comment at this time.

MSF has 2000 staff in the region, of which 200 are internationals.

[This is sad news. MSF previously had an unbroken record of not a single international staff member infected in responding to EVD outbreaks in 30 years. - Mod.JW]

[Subsequent media reports indicate that the MSF staffer is being repatriated to France for treatment.

[2] Evacuation: aircraft availability

With West Africa's burgeoning EVD epidemic expected to last at least 6-9 more months, the demand for evacuations of visiting medical workers who get infected seems likely to grow. That demand might well collide with a shortage of aircraft that are equipped to safely transport Ebola patients. - more

[3] UK: survivor flies to USA to donate blood to victim

William Pooley, the British nurse who was cured of EVD, has been flown to America on a life-saving mission to give blood to a new victim of the deadly virus. Mr Pooley has travelled to Atlanta for an emergency blood transfusion which could save the life of a doctor who contracted the disease while working in Sierra Leone. The 29-year-old, who became the 1st Briton to contract Ebola, could help the US victim fight off the virus because his blood carries antibodies for the disease, the Evening Standard reports.

Mr Pooley was put on a flight on Friday night [12 Sep 2014], paid for by the World Health Organization, to Atlanta [USA], where the doctor is being treated in an isolation unit at Emory University Hospital. Just hours earlier, the Foreign Office had urgently issued him with a new passport because his was incinerated with all of his belongings after he returned from Africa [see comment].

Mr Pooley, from Suffolk, and the new patient, who has not been named, are said to be close friends after working together at the EVD treatment centre in Kenema, Sierra Leone.

[4] Hand sanitizers
Date: 17 Sep 2014

http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/artikel.php?ID=326230


Dr. Alhaji Mohammed Agbeve, CEO and Senior Doctor of Agbeve Herbal Hospital, has warned Ghanaians against the reliance on sanitizers as a means of preventing EVD from infecting them. In an interview with this reporter, Dr. Agbeve, who has over the past few weeks been speaking on the disease, revealed that he was extremely disturbed by the sheer ignorance being displayed by the people of Ghana on the disease and its implications.

According to him, even though he personally uses sanitizers to ensure that his hands are not contaminated with bacteria, he is against the recommendation of sanitizers as a tool for fighting the ebolavirus. He said that the wrong information being peddled that the virus can be killed by sanitizer would motivate people to rely on it and live carelessly without taking precautionary measures.

He said: "Sanitizers only kill a certain percentage of bacteria, whereas EVD is [caused by] a virus, and once a person comes into contact with the body fluid of an EVD patient, no amount of sanitizer can save that person." - more

[Dr. Agbeve's advice runs contrary to that of WHO, the US CDC, Robert Koch Institute & OXFAM; see:

"The WHO recommends in general the use of an alcohol-based hand rub for routine hand disinfection. In its latest publication about the Ebola virus in August 2014, the WHO also describes hand disinfection as the standard of hand decontamination."

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend hand washing with soap and water or use of an alcohol-based hand rub. The German Robert Koch Institute (RKI) recommends the use of an alcohol-based hand rub with a proven efficacy against at least enveloped viruses. Many hand disinfectants are known to be broadly effective against enveloped viruses http://www.bode-science-center.com/center/hygiene-measures/viruses/detail-viruses/article/hand-and-surface-hygiene-for-ebola-virus.html.

OXFAM has donated hand sanitizers to Sierra Leone: http://news.sl/drwebsite/publish/article_200526218.shtml.

Harvard Hosts Global EVD Discussion by video conference
---------------------------------------------
17 Sep 2014: (Bluejeans) Last week, the Harvard School of Public Health hosted a round table discussion on the West Africa EVD outbreak between Dr. Michael VanRooyen, director of the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative and Dyann Wirth, Professor and Chair at the School of Public Health. They were joined by Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who connected from her home country over Blue Jeans' video conferencing service. The discussion covered the impact of EVD and appropriate responses available to the international community... Watch this webcast to hear directly from President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and the other discussion participants.

Liberia: In Time of EVD, a Town Loses Its "Prayer Warrior"
---------------------------------
17 Sep 2014: (Wall St Journal blog) [She] was the praise-and-worship leader at the local Bethel Heart of Faith Church, the one who entered the homes of the sick to pray for their recovery. "She was a prayer warrior," recalled her friend... [She] would place her palms on the stomach, or at times the forehead, of the sufferer she visited... Near the close of August [2014], Sis fell ill. When her fever didn't break, her children carried her to a health clinic nearby, but there was no room... They brought her home... The couple's 4 children ... were under quarantine in a clinic because they had bathed and cared for their ailing mother... [She died] alone, with nobody allowed to touch her... She left Joe Blow Town in a body bag within another body bag, with a police car leading the way to the burial site... [Only] 4 family members [were] permitted by lower Margibi County to attend [the] funeral. They had to remain a safe 50 meters back from the spot just over the hill where pallbearers in rubber boots were burying Sis in the restricted, EVD section of her hometown's cemetery. - more

[This is the heart-rending story of what happens to people who believe they can repeatedly lay hands on EVD sufferers and escape infection themselves. Many pastors have died. They need to understand that protecting themselves against contagion does not mean they lack faith and that their congregations need to have them alive and caring for their well-being. - Mod.JW]
