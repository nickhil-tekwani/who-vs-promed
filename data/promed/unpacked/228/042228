A small hot spot of stripe rust has been found in wheat on a Mallee
property south of Taplan in southeastern South Australia.
Local agronomists are urging farmers to monitor their wheat crops,
particularly susceptible varieties such as Wyalkatchem, Krichauff, and Machete.
Peter Treloar from Rural Solutions SA says the infection is
surprising, given the recent dry conditions. "The new strain is
certainly more aggressive, gets termed the WA strain, seems to be
more aggressive as far as a bigger window for infection in regards to
temperature. I'm surprised, it's being so dry, it must have just been
a lucky shower and [the fungus] just happened to be there and got the
conditions right to infect," he said.

Western Australian farmers are being urged to look out for signs of
stripe rust and _Wheat streak mosaic virus_ (WSMV) in the wheatbelt.
Stripe rust has been found in a wheat crop on a property south of
Cunderdin in the state's southwest, while another disease known as
WSMV was found in a crop south of Koorda.
Plant pathologist with the Department of Agriculture and Food, Geoff
Thomas, says the discovery of stripe rust is still early enough for
the disease to cause significant crop damage.
"[It is] very important that farmers are out having a look at their
crops in relation to crop diseases, obviously, particularly in terms
of a disease like stripe rust," he said. "The earlier that it can be
identified and some control measures such as fungicide application
taken, the lesser chance of crop damage occurring."

[Wheat stripe rust
-----------------
Wheat stripe rust (also called yellow rust) is caused by the fungus
_Puccinia striiformis_ var. _striiformis_ and occurs worldwide mostly
in cooler climates. It causes yellow leaf stripes, stunting of
plants, and reduced grain number and size on developing heads. Yield
losses may vary from 40 up to 100 percent. It affects wheat, some
barley varieties, triticale, and a number of grass species. Spores
are wind dispersed in several cycles during the cropping season. The
fungus needs living plants to survive between seasons, it cannot
survive on seed, stubble, or in soil. Volunteer plants may generate a
"green bridge" providing inoculum to infect new crops. Disease
management strategies include fungicide applications and control of
volunteer wheat plants.
Since the fungus interferes with seed development, infection early in
the crop cycle is more damaging than infection after seed fill has
concluded. Early discovery of infection at any stage of the crop
cycle is important so action can be taken to limit the spread of the
pathogen as well as build-up of inoculum.
Stripe rust was introduced to eastern Australia in 1979, most likely
from Europe. A number of strains with increased virulence on more
wheat varieties developed over time. These strains did not spread to
Western Australia. The pathogen was then introduced again to Western
Australia in 2002, probably from the USA. The WA strain had spread to
eastern Australia by 2003, where it is now dominant. The Australian
Cereal Rust Control Program monitors the occurrence of cereal rust
pathotypes each year and in 2003, for example, 6 pathotypes of stripe
rust were identified throughout Australia.
_Wheat streak mosaic virus_
---------------------------------
_Wheat streak mosaic virus_ (WSMV; genus _Tritimovirus_, family
_Potyviridae_) is prevalent in North America, Russia, Eastern Europe,
and has recently been reported from Australia (2003) and Argentina.
It is spread by the wheat curl mite _Aceria tulipae_. Larvae acquire
the virus by feeding on infected plants and remain infectious for
approximately a week. The virus is not transmitted congenitally to
the progeny of the vector. WSMV can also be mechanically transmitted
and seed transmitted at a very low level. It infects wheat, maize
(some cultivars), grasses, and also oats and barley in experimental
inoculations. Heavy infection of WSMV can cause complete crop failure
in wheat. Control of the mite vector is difficult but disease
management may occur by controlling volunteer wheat and grassy weeds
to minimise inoculum.
The Mallee is an area characterised by its natural vegetation of
small to medium high eucalypt species with multiple trunks.
