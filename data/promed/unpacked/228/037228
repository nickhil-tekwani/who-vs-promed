AMANTADINE FOR INFLUENZA (4)
============================
After reviewing this topic, a working group on Pandemic influenza in Canada
concluded that amantadine probably has no practical role for general
community use in an epidemic. It may be useful in outbreaks in closed
populations and for protection of individuals at high risk who cannot be
vaccinated but otherwise the "public health" use of amatadine is
limited if any.
