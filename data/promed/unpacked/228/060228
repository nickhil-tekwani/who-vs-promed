Recent reports of Japanese encephalitis (JE) activity belie the fact that
disease rates in Viet Nam have decreased in recent years. (1,2)

(see graph at
<http://www.gideononline.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/JE-Vietnam1.png>)

Time and place
--------------
- Japanese encephalitis was first reported in Viet Nam in 1960.
- most cases of Japanese encephalitis in Viet Nam occur in the south during
the rainy and early dry season; and in the north during late summer and autumn
- 61 729 000 persons (73 per cent of the population) live in areas of risk.

Vaccine schedule
----------------
Japanese encephalitis: 12, 13, 25 months; part of country (selected HRD)
[high risk districts] [as part of a comprehensive vaccination program]

WHO estimates for vaccine coverage decreased slightly from 95 per cent in
2006, to 88 per cent in 2008 (see graph).

The incidence of Japanese encephalitis has decreased dramatically during
the past 3 decades -- from a peak of 4935 cases in 1985, to only 558 cases
in 2000.
- 9574 cases were reported during 1986 to 1990; 6981 during 1991 to 1996
- 68 cases were officially reported in 2009
- annual mortality from the disease has varied from 60-150 cases.

Incidence and prevalence
------------------------
- Japanese encephalitis accounted for 67 per cent of acute childhood
encephalitis in Hanoi during the summer of 1995
- the annual incidence among children in southern Viet Nam is 4.6 per cent
(2007 publication)
- a recent outbreak was centered in Ha Bac and Hai Hung
- 8 children died of presumed Japanese encephalitis in Kien Giang Province
in 1999
- 200 cases were reported in the northern region during May to June, 2005

Exported cases
--------------
- an Australian soldier acquired Japanese encephalitis in Viet Nam
(reported in 1975)
- in 2006, an Italian traveler developed Japanese encephalitis (nonfatal)
after returning from Viet Nam
- in 2008, an American tourist contracted Japanese encephalitis (nonfatal)
while in Viet Nam and Cambodia.

Related diseases
----------------
- a new arbovirus, tentatively named "Nam Dinh virus", was implicated in
several cases of encephalitis in Ha Noi and Ha Tay in 2003, and in Bac
Giang Province in 2004.

[ProMED-mail thanks Prof Berger for this interesting background
information. It helps put the 17 Jun 2010 report (ProMED-mail archive no.
20100617.2035) in perspective and answers the question about routine
vaccination against JE virus. The decline in JE cases over time is good
news, indeed.
