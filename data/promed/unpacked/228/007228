[On 19 Sep 2016], one premise in Hillsborough County, Florida was placed under quarantine for strangles, according to an Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) alert. The horse began showing respiratory signs in 7 Sep 2016 after being imported from a Louisiana Kill Facility and was isolated. A respiratory panel taken returned positive for strangles and EHV-4.

The horse is the only equine on the premises and no animals have left the facility since clinical signs began. This is the 2nd case in Hillsborough County and case 20 for Florida in 2016.

Strangles poses no risk to humans, but is highly contagious and common among horses. Strangles is caused by infection with _Streptococcus equi_ subspecies _equi_.

Signs include fever, diminished appetite, nasal discharge (that begins clear and turns purulent), and enlarged submandibular lymph nodes that can become abscessed. It is in the obstructed breathing caused by enlarged lymph nodes and in rare cases death by suffocation that the disease received its name. In most cases, infection with _S. equi_ self-resolves, but this disease has a death rate of about 10 percent, usually from complications involving spread beyond the head and neck, including pneumonia.

Transmission occurs by direct contact between animals and via fomites or water sources. Treatment can include chemotherapy with antibiotics if initiated in the very early stage of the disease or as post-exposure prophylaxis; otherwise, initiation of antibiotic treatment is not recommended due to evidence that it can prolong infection or inhibit formation of post-infection immunity. As about 20 percent of cases become asymptomatic nasal carriers, vaccination is considered the best method of control.

[Strangles is an infectious, contagious disease of Equidae characterized by abscesses in the lymphoid tissue of the upper respiratory tract. The causative organism, _Streptococcus equi equi_, is highly host-adapted and produces clinical disease only in horses, donkeys, and mules. It is a Gram-positive, capsulated-hemolytic Lancefield group (serologically distinguishable groups into which most streptococci can be divided and which are based on the polysaccharide antigens present in the cell walls) C coccus, which is an obligate parasite and a primary pathogen.

_S. equi equi_ is highly contagious and produces high morbidity and low mortality in susceptible populations. Transmission occurs via fomites and direct contact with infectious exudates. Carrier animals are important for maintenance of the bacteria between epizootics and initiation of outbreaks on premises previously free of disease. Survival of the organism in the environment is dependent on temperature and humidity; it is susceptible to desiccation, extreme heat, and exposure to sunlight, and must be protected within mucoid secretions to survive. Under ideal environmental circumstances, the organism can survive 7-9 weeks outside the host. Paddocks and barn facilities used by infected horses should be regarded as contaminated for about 2 months after resolution of an outbreak.

The incubation period of strangles is 3-14 days and the 1st sign of infection is fever (103-106 deg F / 39.4-41.1 deg C). Within 24-48 hours of the initial fever spike, the horse will exhibit signs typical of strangles, including mucoid to mucopurulent nasal discharge, depression, and submandibular lymphadenopathy. Horses with retropharyngeal lymph node involvement will have difficulty swallowing, inspiratory respiratory noise (compression of the dorsal pharyngeal wall), and extended head and neck. Older animals with residual immunity may develop an atypical or catarrhal form of the disease with mucoid nasal discharge, cough, and mild fever. Metastatic strangles ("bastard strangles") is characterized by abscesses in other lymph nodes of the body, particularly in the abdomen and, less frequently, the thorax. The affected horses are quite uncomfortable.

The environment for clinically ill horses should be warm, dry, and dust-free. Warm compresses are applied to sites of lymphadenopathy to facilitate maturation of abscesses. Facilitated drainage of mature abscesses will speed recovery. Ruptured abscesses should be flushed with dilute (3-5 percent) povidone-iodine solution for several days until discharge ceases. NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) can be administered judiciously to reduce pain and fever and improve appetite in horses with fulminant clinical disease.

Antimicrobial therapy is controversial. Most authors agree that initiation of antibiotic therapy after abscess formation may provide temporary clinical improvement in fever and depression, but ultimately prolongs the course of disease by delaying maturation of abscesses. Antibiotic therapy is indicated in cases with dyspnea, dysphagia, prolonged high fever, and severe lethargy/anorexia (loss of appetite). Administration of penicillin during the early stage of infection (up to 24 hours after onset of fever) will usually abort abscess formation. The disadvantage of early antimicrobial treatment is failure to mount a protective immune response, rendering horses highly susceptible to infection after cessation of therapy. If antimicrobial therapy is indicated, procaine penicillin (22 000 IU/kg, intramuscular injection, twice a day) is the antibiotic of choice.

Sharing of halters and brushes that may contact the fluid from draining abscesses can spread the disease to other horses.
