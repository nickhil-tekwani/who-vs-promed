NUJS (National University of Juridical Sciences Kolkata will be closed for the student body for 10 days starting today, 8 Feb 2016, due to the outbreak of chickenpox on campus. Faculty and administrative staff will continue working. NUJS vice chancellor Prof Ishwara Bhatt told Legally India that 13 students contracted varicella recently, and, noticing this outbreak, the administration decided to "act for the health and safety of the students."

An email was sent to students and faculty on campus today [8 Feb 2016] informing everyone of the 10-day break, Bhatt said, and he added that the campus and hostels will be fumigated during the student body's absence. He also said that classes will be "rescheduled."

Legally India understands from sources that the 1st official notification on the disease outbreak sent to students stated that "chicken pox/smallpox" had spread on campus. However, in a follow up email, a reference to the disease smallpox -- eradicated in 1979 -- was deleted.

Classes were rescheduled at Nalsar Hyderabad in January 2015 and at NLU Jodhpur in February 2015 due to the outbreak of swine flu on campus.

[The primary herpes virus infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus is formally referred to as varicella, not chickenpox. The virus does not infect chickens, and it is not a pox virus. From this point forward, ProMED will refer to this infection as varicella. A 10-day hiatus may not be adequate for the incubation period. - Mod.LL
