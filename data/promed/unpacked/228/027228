Alarmed by the reports of the deaths of 3 persons due to hepatitis B at Harnaut in Nalanda during past 2 months and over 2 dozen getting treatment, the Nalanda health department sent medical teams to villages under Harnaut and Chandi blocks on Sat 27 Sep 2014 to verify the authenticity of the report, identify the affected persons, and provide immediate medical support to them. Nalanda civil surgeon (CS) Azad Hind Prasad said the team members are also trying to get in touch with pathological laboratories which investigated those cases.

The 3 deaths occurred in persons from different localities of Harnaut bazaar during last 2 months, while over 20 persons from Basinyawan, Lohra and Gonawan villages under Harnaut block and Bali under Chandi block have been getting treatment at private clinics. The CS said it is difficult to understand how so many persons were affected by hepatitis B as it does not spread through water.

Nalanda DM B Kartikey said efforts will be made to provide all necessary medical support if patients with symptoms of hepatitis are located in the aforesaid areas of the district.

[The vaccine- (available since 1982) preventable disease hepatitis B can cause acute viral hepatitis, which can range from asymptomatic to anicteric [without jaundice] to icteric [with jaundice] to fulminant [sudden and severe] disease and can also cause a chronic infection which can lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. When an infection with HBV is acquired neonatally from an infected mother, chronic infection occurs in as many as 95 percent of cases, and in adults acquiring HBV, the risk of chronicity is 5-10 percent.

What is not at all clear is whether the 3 fatalities were related to acute fulminant HBV infection (which occurs in about one per 1000 cases overall) or, more likely, due to manifestations of chronic hepatitis B. The cases being treated are, almost certainly, related to chronic infection, as specific therapy for acute hepatitis B infection is rarely used.
