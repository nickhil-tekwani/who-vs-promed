The World Health Organization's top influenza expert,
echoing previous warnings, said the virus could mutate into
a form that could kill thousands or millions of people
around the world and urged governments to prepare for such a
pandemic.
But encouraging news came from China, where state media said
a new, improved vaccine for birds had been developed, a
low-cost spray that could protect them from the H5N1 strain
of avian flu.
The spread of the virus in Asia has been blamed on backyard
farms and open-air markets where humans and birds mingle in
often unsanitary conditions, and authorities have been
unable to wipe it out despite large-scale culling and
vaccination.
In Turkey, the state Anatolian news agency reported that
nearly 1000 chickens had died in the east, near the Iranian
border, after being transported from the west of the
country. It said samples had been sent for tests for
possible bird flu, but did not say where exactly the birds
had been moved from. [Updated information on this event
would be appreciated. - Mod.AS]. Turkish officials also said
the incubation period for the avian flu found on a farm in
the north west was over, and the danger to humans had
passed.
The EU Commission in Brussels confirmed that the H5N1 strain
found in Romanian ducks was exactly the same as that
detected in Turkish birds. "The link has now been
confirmed," Health and Consumer Protection Commissioner
Markos Kyprianou said in a statement. Kyprianou said the
European Union had already banned poultry and live bird
imports from Romania, so no further measures were needed. EU
veterinary experts will meet on Thu 20 Oct 2005 to review
the situation, he added.
In Romania, pharmacies ran out of regular flu vaccine and
local media reported that worried citizens had bought up to
2 million doses of the vaccine in the past few days.
Flu vaccine protects people only against the latest strain
of regular flu. Only if H5N1 mutates into a form that passes
easily between humans will pharmaceutical firms be able to
develop a vaccine specifically against that strain.
In Romania's south east Danube delta area, 6 counties were
cordoned off. Television footage showed masked and gloved
veterinarians gassing poultry and disinfecting farms in the
delta village of Ceamurlia de Jos, part of a cull of more
than 60 000 birds aimed at stopping the virus from
spreading. The Danube delta contains Europe's largest
wetlands and is a major resting place for migratory wild
birds -- the carriers of the virus -- coming from Russia,
Scandinavia, Poland and Germany and heading for North Africa
for winter.
Poland, responding to European Commission calls, said all
poultry must be kept indoors from Monday [17 Oct 2005] to
keep it away from migratory wild birds. "The situation means
quite a large danger for poultry in Poland, so I decided to
impose some restrictions ... including a ban on keeping
poultry in open spaces," Farm Minister Jerzy Pilarczyk told
a news conference.

Agriculture ministry buys 8 million doses of avian flu
vaccine
-----------------------------------------------
The Agriculture Ministry has purchased 8 million doses of
vaccine for the 2 violent strains of avian flu, H-7 and H-5,
it was reported on Sunday [16 Oct 2005]. The ministry has
also purchased a protective kit prepared for ministry
employees who could have contact with infected birds. The
vaccine and the kit come from the Netherlands, Israel Radio
reported.
Health Minister Dan Naveh told Haaretz on Sunday [16 Oct
2005] that the government will discuss in its next meeting a
request by his ministry to allocate ILS 150 million [USD 181
million] for medication that combats the avian flu.
Speaking at a meeting of Health Ministry officials, Naveh
said he will tell the government how the ministry is
preparing for a possible outbreak of the pandemic in Israel.
The preparations were being made in the wake of fears that
the strain of bird flu currently circulating in the world
has mutated into a strain that is dangerous for humans, in
which case it could be immune to known drugs.
The Agriculture Ministry has also opened a 24-hour,
7-day-a-week hotline to report birds suspected of being
infected with avian flu. The public is asked to call
03-968-1609 to report the location of straying birds that
appear to be sick or bird carcasses.
The ministry announced it has been testing migratory birds
and poultry in collaboration with the Israel Nature and
Parks Authority to locate infections and examine bird
carcasses. So far, all tests have been negative.
The director general of the Health Ministry, Professor Avi
Yisraeli, told Haaretz over the weekend that the main thing
Israel has to do now is to have Agriculture Ministry
officials watch out for possible cases of avian flu among
migratory birds and domesticated birds in agricultural
communities.
Yisraeli also recommended that residents of Israel go to
their health clinics to get the regular flu shot
administered around this time every year to babies, the
elderly and health care workers.
Officials believe that a dose of the regular seasonal flu
vaccine may reduce the incidence of sickness in case of an
avian flu epidemic, and that the ordinary flu shot could
lessen the chance of contracting both viruses together,
ordinary influenza and avian flu.
Fears for an outbreak of the pandemic in Israel emerged
after the World Organization for Animal Health released
findings indicating flocks of migratory birds nesting in
China were responsible for the outbreak outside South East
Asia. Israel faces this risk since it is located on one of
the major seasonal migratory routes of birds.

[The concern of the Israeli authorities is understandable in
view of Israel's geographical situation as a crossway of
migratory birds on their route from Asia and Europe to
Africa. The number of birds annually migrating through
Israel in each direction is estimated to be around 500
million; see map
