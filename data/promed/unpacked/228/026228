As the state prepares for another round of aerial spraying Monday [13 Aug 2012] to fight disease [virus]-carrying mosquitoes, Easton is emerging as the epicenter of the battle against the deadly virus eastern equine encephalitis [EEEV].

Public health officials have found EEEV in 17 groups of mosquitoes collected in Easton alone; 11 of the positive tests for EEEV came after the state sprayed pesticide over a huge swath of southeastern Massachusetts last month [July 2012], including Easton.

On Wednesday [8 Aug 2012], state officials announced that a man in his 60s from the Metrowest region of Middlesex County has been diagnosed with EEE [virus infection]. The man became ill on 28 Jul [2012] after having recently traveled to the mid-Atlantic region, where he reported receiving a significant number of mosquito bites. He was hospitalized and released.

Public health officials said its unclear where the man was infected with the virus. He lives in an area considered low risk for EEE.

By contrast, Easton and the other towns in which the Hockomock Swamp lies are hotbeds of virus-infected mosquito activity.

The swamp is one of the key areas public health officials keep an eye on each summer, state public health veterinarian Catherine Brown said. And this year [2012], it's more worrisome than ever.

Easton has curtailed evening activities since the 1st spraying, and several other communities followed suit Tuesday [7 Aug 2012] after the state raised the threat level from high to critical.

Mosquitoes are most active after dusk. Some town activities have been moved to earlier in the evening to reduce the risk of exposure to mosquitoes.

[A large part of the east coast of the USA, including coastal Massachusetts, is endemic for EEE virus. Although a vaccine is available for equine animals, there is no commercially available vaccine for human use. The only practical measure for prevention of human infections is avoidance of mosquito bites, as the above report emphasizes. This is still early in the EEEV transmission season, so it would not be surprising if there is spill-over from the wild bird-mosquito transmission cycle to horses and humans until the 1st killing frosts occur in autumn. It would be prudent for all horse owners to be sure that their animals' vaccinations are current. There are frequent neurological sequelae following clinical human encephalitis from EEEV infections. No mention of persistent neurological problems is made in the above case.
