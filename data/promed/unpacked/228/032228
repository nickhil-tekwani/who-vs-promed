Abstract
--------
Bourbon virus (BRBV) was first isolated in 2014 from a resident of Bourbon County, Kansas, USA, who died of the infection. In 2015, an ill Payne County, Oklahoma, resident tested positive for antibodies to BRBV, before fully recovering. We retrospectively tested for BRBV in 39 096 ticks from northwestern Missouri, located 240 km [149 mi] from Bourbon County, Kansas. We detected BRBV in 3 pools of _Amblyomma americanum_ (L.) ticks: 1 pool of male adults and 2 pools of nymphs. Detection of BRBV in _A. americanum_, a species that is aggressive, feeds on humans, and is abundant in Kansas and Oklahoma, supports the premise that _A. americanum_ is a vector of BRBV to humans. BRBV has not been detected in nonhuman vertebrates, and its natural history remains largely unknown.

[Although rare, Bourbon virus is capable of causing serious, even fatal, disease. The above report makes a strong case for _A. americanum_ as the vector of Bourbon virus. One hopes that transmission experiments will follow. It will be interesting to learn which wildlife species are the reservoirs of the virus, and the extent of its geographic distribution. As of 27 Jun 2017, a limited number of Bourbon virus disease cases have been identified in Missouri, Oklahoma, and Kansas. Some people who have been infected later died. At this time, it is not known whether the virus might be found in other areas of the United States.

Mod.LK provided an informative comment, "Bourbon virus is a member of the _Thogotovirus_ genus of enveloped RNA viruses, one of 7 genera in the virus family Orthomyxoviridae. Their single-stranded, negative-sense RNA genome has 6 or 7 segments. Several related viruses have been identified in hard tick species; while it is unknown how Bourbon virus is transmitted, it is also assumed to be tick-borne because of the seasonality of the disease and association with tick bites (see Bourbon virus - USA: (MO) tick-borne case 20170703.5147985).

ProMED thanks Greg Folkers for sending in the report above.
