----------------------------------------------------------------
Further to ProMED-mail's request for information about the ASF (African
swine fever) situation in Georgia, included in the posting above, here are
some available data.
After the joint FAO/EC/OIE (UN Food and Agriculture Organization/European
Commission/World Organization for Animal Health) assessment mission in June
[2007; see ProMED-mail 20070627.2066], an assistance mission from SDC
(Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation) took place on request of the
Georgian government between 1 and 14 Jul 2007; 4 Swiss experts worked on
epidemiological investigations and on a proposal for a disease control program.
The following recommendations were made to the Government of Georgia:
- to establish a national task force for the strategic lead of the ASF
control plan;
- to establish geographically "disease-free zones" (short term),
enlargement of these disease-free zones by strict control measures in the
intermediate zones (mid term), and to eradicate ASF from Georgia (long term);
- to prohibit free-roaming pigs and to confine pigs;
- to restrict the movement of pig products (fresh pork and meat products)
in infected zones and intermediate zones;
- to compensate for killed pigs, but with a defined system;
- to implement a system of disease investigation and epidemio-surveillance;
- to improve the national communication strategy;
- to engage veterinarians in the border inspection service;
- to improve waste management.

[We are very grateful to Prof. Kihm for the data above. It is fortunate to
obtain access to the complete mission's report, available at
<http://www.safoso.ch/activities/ongoing_activities/070731_Report_ASF_Geogria_SDC_HH_final.pdf>

From the document, we hereby present Annex A3 [edited]:
Epidemiological report on ASF outbreak in Georgia
A3.1 Current situation
A3.1.1 Development of the outbreak
----------------------------------
The outbreak of ASF started on 22 Apr 2007 around the harbour city of Poti,
although already in the beginning of April 2007 increased mortality of pigs
was reported in Poti. The current most likely hypothesis of introduction of
the virus is via importation of contaminated pork or pork waste from
international ships. However, it will be very difficult, or even
impossible, to definitively prove this hypothesis, due to the long time
between the beginning of the outbreak and its official recognition, as well
as due to the lack of documentation.
Starting from 22 Apr 2007, data were collected on the number of dead pigs
in each district.
These numbers were used to follow the course of the outbreak. No laboratory
diagnosis was conducted during this period. The ASF outbreak was officially
confirmed on 4 Jun 2007. On 6 Jun 2007, the outbreak was considered to have
spread to 48 districts (annex 5.1).
Starting from 7 Jun 2007, the crisis centre (see also section below)
collects daily information about the number of dead pigs in the districts.
In annex 5.2, the course of the outbreak following the 1st week after
confirmation is presented in maps.
In annex 5.3, all districts are presented that have reported dead pigs
until 9 Jul 2007.
As of 9 Jul 2007, in 56 of 61 districts dead pigs were reported. The
distribution of reported dead pigs on 9 Jul 2007 is shown in annex 5.4.
Also in annex 5.4, an overview is given on the regions from which samples
were collected.
A3.1.2 Crisis centre
--------------------
The Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) installed a hotline and crisis centre on
7 Jun 2007, after the official confirmation of the ASF outbreak by the OIE
reference laboratory in Pirbright. This centre is located within the MoA.
Before 7 Jun 2007, information about outbreaks was collected in the
Veterinary Supervision Department of the National Service of FSVPP
[National Service for Food Safety, Veterinary and Plant Protection.]
3 telephone hotlines were installed where district officers, veterinarians,
and other people can report sick and dead pigs, however according to the
staff of the crisis centre this rarely occurs. The staff of the crisis
centre contacts the veterinary headquarters in each district 3 times per
day for updated information regarding the number of dead pigs and the
number of pigs that were killed by the hunter teams. These hunter teams in
the districts are responsible for killing free-roaming and sick pigs in the
villages. Daily reports are produced by the crisis centre stating the
following 4 parameters: number of dead pigs, cumulative number of dead pigs
since the beginning of the outbreak, number of pigs killed by hunter teams,
and cumulative number of pigs killed by hunter teams. Data are collected by
district, the names of the villages are included whenever this information
is available. Daily reports are made to the minister and deputy minister of
Agriculture. The new outbreaks are also indicated on a map of Georgia,
which provides a quick overview of the spread of disease over the country.
In the early days of the crisis centre, information was collected from the
veterinary district headquarters about the estimated numbers of pigs in
each village. Based on this information and the cumulative number of dead
pigs, mortality rates are calculated on a daily basis. Otherwise, no
epidemiological data are collected about the outbreaks.
In the crisis centre, the data are stored in an Excel database. For each
day a new worksheet is used. The columns in the database include the
following information:
- district (with names of villages and the number of dead pigs per village
in brackets whenever available),
- number of dead pigs,
- cumulative number of dead pigs since the beginning of the outbreak,
- number of pigs killed by hunter teams,
- cumulative number of pigs killed by hunter teams.
The reports of outbreaks are based on clinical signs only. In almost all
cases there is no laboratory diagnosis to confirm the presence of the
virus, and no samples are routinely collected from dead pigs for subsequent
testing. The crisis centre does not use a threshold level of a minimum
number of dead pigs; a certain degree of over-estimating the extent of the
outbreak can therefore not be excluded. Simultaneously however, a certain
degree of underestimating cannot be excluded either, because pigs that die
away from villages may not be reported at all.
A3.1.3 Conclusions of the current epidemiological reporting system
------------------------------------------------------------------
The information that is available in the crisis centre does not allow
[drawing] any conclusions about origin or further spread of the virus.
Since the reporting system is only based on clinical symptoms, it is
possible that villages are falsely declared ASF-infected. This may
specifically be the case in villages where only very few dead pigs are
reported.
The epidemiological data that are collected by the laboratory (see annex 2)
are strongly focused on clinical signs and on a description of the animals
that are sampled. Little information is gathered that would allow tracing
backward and forward, and no information is collected regarding movement of
people or equipment. This TADR [Threat Agents Detection and Response]
investigation form was not developed specifically for ASF disease
investigation in Georgia, but it is a universal form that can be applied
for different contagious diseases and in different countries.
Information about newly reported outbreaks (based on clinical signs) is not
shared with the laboratory to confirm the new outbreak with a laboratory
result. Neither are laboratory results shared with the crisis centre to
confirm reports of clinically affected pigs.
The Excel database in the crisis centre is likely to reach the limits of
its capacities, when the Excel program does not allow [inserting] more
worksheets. As well, the Excel database collects the information on a
district level, rather than on a village level. This approach facilitates a
quick overview of infected districts, but at the same time complicates any
epidemiological disease investigation, as these investigations would be
conducted on a village or household level.
