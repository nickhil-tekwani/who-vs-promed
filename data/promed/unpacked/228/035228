A cholera outbreak has killed more than 550 people in more than 42 000 cases reported since January 2016 in eastern and southern Africa, reported a humanitarian agency of the United Nations (UN) on 10 Feb 2016.

The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in eastern Africa said that outbreaks of cholera in the region in 2015 have been remarkable, both in their tendency to reappear shortly after being extinguished and in their ability to affect large geographic areas.

"Until 21 Jan 2016 [it is not entirely clear if all of these cases and deaths occurred in the 1st 3 weeks of 2016. - Mod.LL], more than 42 000 cases of cholera and more than 550 related deaths have been reported in the region," he said. The disease, which is preventable, is affecting Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe.

OCHA said, in its latest report, that the situation in Tanzania is particularly worrisome because the disease has spread in 21 of the 30
regions of the country, including the islands of Pemba and Unguja and Zanzibar since the outbreak began in May 2015 .

The WHO notes that the main causes of cholera are the lack of clean water and sanitary conditions and inadequate facilities. WHO also he said it has increased support to respond to outbreaks of cholera in Malawi and Mozambique.

Dr Pitters has since advised the public to enhance self-hygiene such as washing hands with clean water. She pointed out that there is need for the public to avoid unnecessary handshakes and public gatherings during the cholera outbreak period.

Meanwhile, Dr Pitters says a cholera treatment center has been set up at Kanyama health center for isolation and treatment of cholera patients. She said an emergency epidemic preparedness committee was held today at the Ministry with stakeholders to respond to the outbreak.

This is the 1st time Lusaka has a cholera outbreak since the year 2010.

Cholera and diarrhea have so far claimed 6 lives in Lakhipur sub-division of Cachar district [Assam State], health officials said on Wed 10 Feb 2016. The deaths were reported from Dilkush tea garden and Dungripar locality. Cachar district joint director of health Sudip Jyoti Das said 2 of the deaths were due to cholera. This was confirmed after tests were conducted at Silchar Medical College and Hospital [SMCH]. The patients were admitted to SMCH after they were struck by diarrhea, he said. Sources said while 12 patients of the area suffering from diarrhea are admitted to SMCH, more are being treated at their home. Contaminated water is believed to be the reason for the spread of cholera and diarrhoea in Lakhip.
