Minnesota Turkey Flock Has H7N9 Avian Flu. Surveillance established
but no need to worry.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A turkey flock in south central Minnesota has been tested positive
for the H7N9 strain of avian influenza. The birds in a commercial
flock located in Meeker County, Minnesota, appear healthy and show no
sign of infection. The poultry on the premises have been quarantined
by the Minnesota Board of Animal Health. The State Board of Animal
Health has also established a surveillance zone around the operation.

BAH Assistant Director and Minnesota Poultry Testing Laboratory
Director Dr. Dale Lauer says this development should serve as a
reminder to all involved with animal agriculture the need to be
vigilant in observing the strictest possible biosecurity to protect
our animals.

Officials say the H7N9 avian influenza virus is different from the
one that's caused problems in birds and humans mostly in Asia, and
that the virus isn't a threat unless it mutates. Officials add bird
flu in domestic poultry is not unusual and it's still safe to eat
Minnesota turkey.

Minnesota quarantines turkey flock due to bird flu
--------------------------------------------------
A commercial turkey flock in central Minnesota has been quarantined
after routine testing discovered the avian flu virus. The state
Bureau of Animal Health says the birds appeared healthy and showed no
signs of infection and there is no sign of illness among farm workers.

The board is following the state's containment plan by quarantining
the flock and all other flocks within 3 miles. They will be
repeatedly tested for the virus for 6 weeks.

Dr. Dale Lauer is the assistant director of the board. He says it's
not uncommon to find the bird flu virus in domestic poultry flocks,
and Minnesota turkey remains safe.

However, if the virus is left unchecked it can change into a form
that's lethal to domestic poultry. Minnesota is the nation's top
turkey producing state.

Minnesota quarantines turkey flock due to bird flu
--------------------------------------------------
A commercial turkey flock in central Minnesota has been quarantined
after routine testing discovered a strain of the avian flu virus, the
state Board of Animal Health announced Wednesday [5 Aug 2009].

Minnesota Board of Animal Health Assistant Director Dale Lauer
stressed that the avian flu strain found at the Meeker County farm
was different from the more lethal strain has caused problems in
birds and humans mostly in Asia. "It's probably apples and
watermelons," he said. "It's completely different. It's a big, big difference."

Lauer, a veterinarian, said the strain of virus found at the farm
didn't pose a threat to the general public but could cause mild
symptoms in poultry workers. He said the quarantined flock was
showing no signs of illness, but if left unchecked the virus could
morph into a form that could be lethal to the state's commercial
poultry flocks. Minnesota is the nation's top turkey producing state.

Lauer would not identify the farm but said the flock and other flocks
within 3 miles would stay under quarantine for 6 weeks while they are
repeatedly tested for the virus. If the animals recover, he said,
they could go back into the food supply. He said the board's testing
frequently finds blood evidence that domestic turkey flocks have been
exposed to strains of the avian flu. The Meeker County flock was
somewhat different in that testing found live virus.

"It simply means our testing methods are getting better," he said.
Domestic turkey operations can get the virus from wild turkeys and
migrating water fowl, he said. He called the Meeker County incident
another reminder for poultry producers to secure their flocks.

The Minnesota Health Department is monitoring about 20 poultry
workers at the turkey farm because the strain of virus found there,
H7N9, has been known to cause mild eye infections and mild
respiratory problems in people who work with infected turkeys.

However, Joni Scheftel, state public health veterinarian for the
Health Department, said none of the workers have shown any symptoms.
"We haven't seen any problems at all," she said.

Lauer said the workers could stay on the job during the quarantine
and wouldn't need protective gear beyond the boots, coveralls, masks
and caps they usually wear.

[Clearly the facility is quarantined. Currently this outbreak is
controlled and relatively mild. It is wise to pay attention to it as
these viruses can mutate and become more highly pathogenic. Also the
workers will be closely watched for any signs of illness.
