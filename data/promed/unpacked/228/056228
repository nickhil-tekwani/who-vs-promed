China: Pediatric Diarrhea Increasing in Beijing; Rotavirus suspected
--------------------------------------------------------------------
A new virus still has not been discovered from among the cases of pediatric
diarrhea in Beijing municipality. Yesterday, the media said that since the
onset of winter, this city has seen a gradual increase in pediatric
diarrhea, and there were specialists who said that the cause of this
pediatric diarrhea is suspected to be a new virus. This reporter went to
confirm this information from the Beijing Children's Hospital, and received
a denial [that a new virus is involved] in response. The hospital
indicated that, as of now, the hospital has yet to [isolate] a new type of
virus, and has never come to the conclusion [that a new virus has emerged].

Yesterday's headline that: "Children's Hospital Receiving 1000 Pediatric
Diarrhea Cases Daily, New Virus Suspected" has aroused the attention of not
a few children and parents. After the news was reported, many children and
parents anxiously called the hospital for more information. But this
reporter learned from the hospital that for seasonal reasons, every year
during this period there is always an increase in diarrhea patients treated
at the hospital. This period is the high season for diarrhea cases in fall
and winter. The patient population includes adults as well as children.
Looking at current conditions, the primary cause of diarrhea among
pediatric patients is rotavirus, not that a new virus has emerged. For
this reason, parents and pediatric patients need not be overly worried.

China (Hong Kong): Students Affected by Gastroenteritis Outbreak
-------------------------------------------------
Following an [outbreak of an] intestinal virus infection that spread to 150
students at Sacred Heart Canossian College, another group of pupils have
come down with gastroenteritis. Last Friday, 14 students, aged between 7
and 15, at Caritas Jockey Club Lok Yan School began to show symptoms of
gastroenteritis. They are now at Caritas Medical Centre receiving
treatment. 2 female nurses also contracted the infection. The hospital
has activated a Green Alert and the school has suspended classes.

The parents of affected students say that the Medical Centre had at least
10 sick students as early as 10 days ago who experienced vomiting, and
question whether the hospital intentionally withheld this news. With
regard to this, Caritas yesterday was temporarily unable to provide a response.

China: Reassessment of Gastroenteritis Outbreak in Guangzhou
---------------------------------------------------
On 12 Nov 2003, an outbreak of gastroenteritis was reported by ProMED-mail
in Guangzhou, China, and subsequently archived as "Viral gastroenteritis
update 2003 (24) 20031112.2801".

This report suggested that the etiologic agent was a virus and that the
symptoms of fever, vomiting and diarrhea were characteristic if a viral
gastroenteritis. A subsequent report suggested that the incident was
probably the result of staphylococcal food poisoning.

For the description of this reassessment and Moderator LL's evaluation, see
"Gastroenteritis, staphylococcal - China (Guangzhou) 20031117.2854" and
"Gastroenteritis, staphylococcal - China (Guangzhou) (02) 20031118.2866". -
