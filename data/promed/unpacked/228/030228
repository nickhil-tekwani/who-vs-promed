[2] Cholera, Somali refugees - Kenya (North Eastern province)

On Thursday [12 Feb 2009], 2 relief agencies said that one case of cholera
and 14 suspected cases have been reported in the Hagadera refugee camp in
Dadaab, [north east] Kenya, numbers that have the potential to spike as
Somali refugees inundate already overstretched camps. The International
Rescue Committee (IRC) and the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) said in a
joint statement issued in Nairobi that they are working tirelessly to
contain the outbreak.

An average of 5000 Somalis are streaming into Dadaab every month, fleeing
ongoing violence in the Horn of Africa nation. Hagadera, one of 3 camps in
Dadaab, was originally designed for 50 000 people, but is now home to 90
000 refugees, making the pressure on existing resources intense.

[3] Cholera - Malawi

The cholera outbreak in Malawi is reported to have killed over 60 people.
Media reports in the southern African country say about 67 people have died
across the 17 affected districts. Malawi's capital Lilongwe is the hardest
hit as recently its death toll stood at 39. The country's local daily of
The Nation quoted minister of health Khumbo Kachali as saying over 2000
cases have been recorded since the start of the rainy season with 67 people
reported dead.

According to the report, this year's cholera cases are higher. Malawi has
since established cholera camps in Lilongwe to fight the spread of the
disease, which according to principal secretary for health has been caused
by poor hygiene and drinking of unsafe water. "Lilongwe has registered 1478
cases and 40 people have died," said Kachali.

The other districts affected by the disease are Balaka in the southern
region, which has registered 203 cases with one death, Mangochi also in the
southern region with 143 cases and 3 deaths; and Nkhata Bay in the northern
region, which has registered 5 deaths.

The minister then appealed to people to improve their hygiene to fight the
disease.

Several countries in Africa are experiencing the rainy season, which has
further prolonged the cholera disease.

[5] Cholera - Mozambique

Cholera has spread to all but 2 of Mozambique's 10 provinces, but that does
not deter hundreds of vendors and buyers from crowding the waterlogged,
garbage strewn Xiquelene market on the eastern outskirts of the capital,
Maputo.

Outbreaks of cholera are common during the rainy season and there are still
2 months to go, so health authorities remain on high alert.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has noted that cholera "remains a
challenge to countries where access to safe drinking water and adequate
sanitation cannot be guaranteed ... typical at-risk areas include
peri-urban slums." The numbers show the risk is real: according to the
Ministry of Health, 2655 cases and 21 deaths were recorded in Mozambique
during the month of January 2009 alone. Since the outbreak began in October
2008, there have been 4132 cholera cases and 52 cholera-related deaths.

The latest cholera update by the UN Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs noted that the case fatality rate since the outbreak
began was 1.3 per cent but had dropped to 0.56 per cent in January 2009.
Only the 2 southern provinces of Gaza and Inhambane have not record
cholera-related fatalities; the highest fatality rates were recorded in
Mozambique's northern and central provinces of Nampula, Cabo Del Gado,
Manica, and Tete.
