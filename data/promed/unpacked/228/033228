Teenager Fights Off Rabid Coyote Attack
N.H. Wildlife Expert: Attack On Human 'Highly Unusual'

HOPKINTON, N.H. -- New Hampshire officials say a teenager walking his dog in Hopkinton was attacked by a coyote and is receiving a course of rabies shots as a precaution.

A Fish and Game wildlife biologist called the Wednesday attack on a human "highly unusual" and said they believe the coyote is rabid because of its uncharacteristically aggressive behavior.

Officials believe the same coyote attacked a dog in Hopkinton earlier in the week. The dog survived, but required veterinary care. [Hopefully the pet was vaccinated against rabies. – Mod.TG]

Fish and Game officials say the teen, whose name was not released, was walking the family dog in a wooded area near his home when the coyote approached. His dog ran and the coyote attacked the teenager. Officials say the teen punched the coyote repeatedly in the nose until it ran off. The teenager was scratched and possibly bitten by the coyote.

"It's the first time we know of that a coyote has attacked a person in New Hampshire," wildlife biologist Pat Tate said. He said local residents need to be aware the coyote is out there.

Fish and Game conservations officers and Hopkinton police are searching for the coyote and plan to kill it on sight, if possible. The animal will then be tested for rabies. Tate said coyotes are present throughout the state and typically show no interest in humans or pets.

"This incident, as scary as it was, gives us no reason to fear wild animals in general," Tate said. "We suspect it's the same coyote and that the coyote is rabid, given the uncharacteristic aggressiveness of the attacks.

"If a coyote expresses any interest in a human - whether friendly or aggressive - that's unusual and that's when you need to be on alert," Tate said.

Tate recommends people yell at coyotes to instill fear. Most, he said, will retreat when faced with loud noise or throw objects. "Shout at it. Make sure it knows you are a threat," Tate said. "If it comes at you, hit it hard on the head and snout."

Hopkinton residents who spot an aggressive coyote are asked to call the Fish and Game dispatch center at 271-3361 during the day and 911 in the evening.

Dog put down after biting 4; rabies tests awaited

West Palm Beach, Florida -- Authorities say a dog was euthanized after it attacked 4 people -- including a 3-year-old girl and a firefighter.

West Palm Beach Fire Rescue crews were called about 6 p.m. Thursday after the dog bit a 13-year-old girl on the arm. City spokesman Allan Ortman says they were told the dog had also bitten the girl's grandmother.

The Palm Beach Post reports the dog broke free as rescuers were treating the girl. It then bit the younger child on the buttocks. A firefighter was bitten as he tried to separate the dog from the child.

Animal control officials took the dog, which was euthanized. Spokeswoman Dianne Sauve says brain tissue samples from the cane corso [mastiff] mix will be tested for rabies. The dog was not current on rabies vaccinations.

Area between Archer, Newberry and Bronson under rabies alert
A Levy County family is getting a series of rabies vaccines starting today after the family pet dog tested positive for rabies.

In connection with that case, the Alachua County Health Department is warning the public about the rabies danger.

The rabies alert will be in effect for the next 60 days in the around around Forest Park and University Oaks -- in an area between Archer, Newberry and Bronson.
Anyone who might have come in contact with the dog -- a light brown American bulldog - since Feb. 9 is urged to contact the Health Department.

“Hopefully there aren’t any other exposures, but we want to get the word out as best we can because there is no cure for rabies and it is fatal,” said Anthony Dennis, environmental health director for the Alachua County Health Department.

The dog, reportedly last vaccinated 7 years ago, was found with a dead raccoon last month and began acting aggressively Sunday. On Tuesday, a veterinarian reported to the Levy County Health Department that a dog had been euthanized and needed to be tested for rabies. The dog’s brain tissue was tested at state Health Department labs in Tampa and results came back positive for rabies Thursday, Dennis said.
Interviews with the owner Thursday revealed that the dog had scratched his owner’s legs and been behaving aggressively to the family’s 2 other dogs.

Post-exposure rabies vaccination was recommended for the owner. Friday, the owner, his wife and the two children went to an Alachua hospital for treatment. The family’s other 2 dogs will be euthanized. [If these dogs are being euthanized then it is likely they did were not vaccinated against rabies. – Mod.TG]

The area of the alert is basically between Bronson and Newberry and, specifically, north of State Road 24, east of State Road 337, south of Southwest 119th Avenue and West of Northeast 130th Avenue.

Residents should not approach wild or unfamiliar animals, Dennis said.

In a news release, he also issued the following advice:
■ All pets should have current rabies immunizations.
■ Secure outside garbage in covered containers to avoid attracting wild animals.
■ Do not leave pet food outside. This also attracts other animals.
■ For questions regarding the health of an animal, contact a veterinarian.
■ Persons who have been bitten or scratched by wild or domestic animals should seek medical attention and report the injury to the local County Health Department.
Those who want further information are urged to visit the Florida Department of Health website:

[In the second and third article, it states the dog was not current on its rabies shots while the first article does not tell us if the domestic dog was current on its rabies shots.

Regardless of location, the best thing a pet owner can do to protect themselves and their families is to vaccinate the pets against rabies. This helps build a barrier between yourself and the disease. In the event your pet is the victim of an attack from a rabid animal it may be what saves your pet’s life.

Check with your veterinarian about getting a rabies shot for your pet. – Mod.TG
