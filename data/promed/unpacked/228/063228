SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME - WORLDWIDE (04):COMMENT

Like many ProMED readers I read the Sudden acute respiratory syndrome (ARS)
postings with concern and some skepticism. I believe that this is a clear
message here for the improvement in international surveillance and in risk
communication to the public.

It is worth noting that there is no agent identified; this could be a
worrisome indication of the intrusion of a new agent or represent the
accidental concatenation of unrelated diseases. I have to recall the
"plague epidemic" in Surat in 1994 which was of course never reliably
elucidated, but nevertheless resulted in billions of dollars in economic
impact and considerable human suffering, panic, and aggravation. Then
there are the Ebola outbreaks that have so far responded to fairly orthodox
infection control measures; although the case fatality rate is high, the
communicability is greatly over-exaggerated in most popular reports.

A quality laboratory capacity and adequate epidemiological expertise will
continue to be crucial in being able to understand the real significance of
outbreaks early on. By making an early and accurate diagnosis and
understanding the nature of transmission, control measures can be started
early and the public can be appropriately warned or reassured as is
appropriate.

If this is a highly transmissible and lethal pulmonary infection, the
wisdom of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in including emerging
infections in the brief of their biodefense activities and in supporting
the construction of additional high containment laboratories will be
confirmed in a very immediate and practical way.

In 1992 the Institute of Medicine (IOM) issued the landmark report Emerging
Infections: Microbial Threats to Health in the United States and many of
the issues were identified and actions urged. A considerable change in
attitude resulted and some of the problems were addressed. However, the
IOM revisited the problem in a report to be released on 19 March
2003. Unfortunately, the conclusions of the report were that many of the
inadequacies of our system have not been corrected and that the external
events leading to emergence of new problems have continued to escalate. A
look at Microbial Threats to Health: Emergence, Detection, and Response is
worthwhile and a little scary.

[Dr. Peters is raising some very good points in his discussion. It seems
only logical that a good infrastructure that will allow for early detection
and identification of emerging infectious diseases would be a major
component of biologic terrorism. We look forward to reading the document
Microbial Threats to Health: Emergence, Detection, and Response when it
becomes available this week. - Mod.MPP]
