Hares killed by disease found for 1st time in Cyprus
----------------------------------------------------
Hunters have found dead hares in all parts of the island that died from a disease that has been seen here for the 1st time.

A number of hares that died from the fatal disease pseudotuberculosis were found in all districts of the island recently except for Famagusta, according to an announcement by the Game Fund.

The Game Fund located a number of dead hares during the January to April 2012 hunting period. From these hares around 6 were good enough to conduct a post-mortem on, from which it was discovered they died from pseudotuberculosis.

Head of the Game Fund Pantelis Hadjigerou reassured yesterday [Sat 16 Jun 2012] on the state broadcaster's 3rd radio programme that the disease has not spread to any more animals and there has been no indication of it having spread to humans.

The disease is caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pseudotuberculosis_ and the animal becomes infected orally, by ingesting water and food that has been contaminated with the bacteria, said the announcement.

"The disease can potentially be transmitted to humans that's why we wanted to let people know and advise them that they should cook the hares very well and if they notice that the intestines are a strange colour they should not eat them," Game Fund official Petros Anayiotos told the Cyprus Mail yesterday [16 Jun 2012].

He also stressed that hunters should under no circumstances feed the intestines to their dogs or the disease will be transmitted to them. "If their dogs do transmit it they'll know at some point from the dog's appearance as they will tend to lose weight," said Anayiotos. This is one of the symptoms including an enlarged spleen and necrosis of tissue.

This is the 1st time that the disease has appeared in Cyprus due to the high humidity and low temperatures over the winter and early spring period. It is a more common disease in hares in central Europe.

According to the announcement, as it is the 1st time it has appeared on the island, the Veterinary Services are looking into it. They also reassured that since the weather has warmed up the cycle of the disease has ended. Since April 2012 no more dead hares have been found.

Hunters are advised to lay off hunting hares for a while to allow the numbers to rise again and the hare population to replenish. If they find any dead hares they are advised to get in contact with their district Game Fund office to report where the hare was found.

[_Yersinia pseudotuberculosis_ infections are known to have led to significant lethality in European brown hare (_Lepus europaeus_) populations especially during the cold and wet seasons. During a serosurvey in hare populations in North-Rhine Westphalia, Germany, published in 2004, a total of 89.6 percent of the 230 animals tested were seropositive. It was postulated that subclinical yersiniosis could have been related to the decline of European brown hare populations in Germany.

It will be interesting to note if the current outbreak means a recent introduction of the bacterium into the hare population of Cyprus or just the reflection of the 1st detection of an established situation.
