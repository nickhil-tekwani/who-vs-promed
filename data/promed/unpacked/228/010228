On [9 Dec 2021], Hong Kong authorities abruptly suspended the sale of 6 ice cream flavours from Belgium chocolatier Godiva.

Hong Kong's Centre for Food Safety (CFS) shared in a [9 Dec 2021] press release it had been alerted to the presence of a banned substance -- ethylene oxide -- in the France-imported ice creams.

The authorities received a notification issued by the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) of the European Commission.

Ethylene oxide, described to be a "pesticide", was found in the stabiliser used in the ice cream products and is currently not authorised by the European Union (EU).

Consumers were advised against consuming the affected Godiva ice cream products, if they had bought any.

The CFS added the trade should also "stop using or selling the affected batches of the products immediately if they possess them."

The 6 affected Godiva products in question are:
- Chocolate Cheesecake Flavoured Ice Cream
- Milk Chocolate Frozen Confection with Dark Chocolate
- Belgian Dark Chocolate Ice Cream
- Vanilla Flavoured Cocoa Infused Ice Cream
- Caramel Coffee Frozen Confection with Dark Chocolate Chips, and
- Strawberry Ice Cream with Dark Chocolate Chips

All had "best before" dates ranging from [31 Oct 2021 to 30 Apr 2023].

In its press release, the CFS shared it has contacted the local importer concerned for follow-up.

"Preliminary investigation found the above-mentioned importer had imported into Hong Kong the affected batches of the products concerned."

For prudence, a recall was initiated, and the importer was ordered to stop sale and remove the affected Godiva products from shelves.

Investigations are ongoing.

According to the South China Morning Post, ethylene oxide is a chemical typically used to reduce or eliminate contamination of salmonella bacteria in food.

An associate professor at the School of Science and Technology in Hong Kong Metropolitan University shared information regarding the chemical, which exists as an odourless gas at room temperature and is commonly used in industrial cleaning disinfectants.

She added because the contaminant was found in ice cream, this made it likely for consumers to ingest the chemical, which could lead to gastric irritation, or even liver injury.

It could also lead to eye or skin irritation, even at low concentrations. As it is a gas at room temperature, it could also result in lung injury if inhaled, she said.

According to past reports, the EU had previously deemed there is "no safe level" of consumption of ethylene oxide. It was deemed by the French governmental agency for food safety as "a carcinogenic, mutagenic and reprotoxic substance."

[Ethylene oxide is an effective sterilant used in medical equipment, and also for ridding herbs and spices of insects. So, there are recognized uses for ethylene oxide.

It appears the level of detection in a number of foodstuffs, including guar gum, used in some ice creams, is below the level of detection of 0.02 mg/kg, in some brands. According to the EU, this may be for things manufactured prior to 14 Jun 2021 (https://www.foodwatch.org/en/news/2021/toxic-ethylene-oxide-in-foods/?cookieLevel=not-set).

When levels of ethylene oxide are below 0.02 mg/kg, as mentioned above, the limited consumption of foods, such as a spice or occasional ice cream, containing ethylene oxide doesn't pose an acute risk to health, but there may be an increased risk if contaminated foods are consumed over a long period of time with officials not certain when contamination started. Most ice cream products seem to be at, or below the level of 0.02 mg/kg of ethylene oxide. Higher levels of ethylene oxide would certainly be of concern.

Regulations and the interpretations may vary between continents and even between states or member countries within a region. - Mod.TG
