The pandemic A (H1N1) influenza outbreak, which has killed nearly 800
people on the Chinese mainland, has passed its peak in the
autumn-winter flu season, the Ministry of Health said Tuesday [2 Mar 2010].

The mainland saw a sharp drop in the proportion of A/H1N1 in all flu
cases, down from 36.6 percent in January 2010 to 11.1 percent last
month [February 2010], the Ministry said in a report posted on its
website. The disease had killed 793 people by 28 Feb 2010, including
18 last month, according to the report. Experts spotted no mutations
in the virus, and an estimated 30 percent of the population had
immunity against the strain, the report said.

The Ministry, however, warned that though a pandemic was unlikely to
occur in the near future, localized spreading of the disease could
not yet be ruled out, especially in crowded public venues such as
schools. The Ministry said flu prevention measures should not be
eased as the population still had limited access to immunization
against the A/H1N1 flu strain. As of 28 Feb 2010, more than 82
million Chinese people had been inoculated with the A/H1N1 flu
vaccine, according to the report.
