Poliovirus Weekly Update as of 18 May 2022, World Health Organization
New wild poliovirus isolates reported this week:
Acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases: 1
Environment samples (ES): 0
Others: 0

New circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) isolates reported this week:
AFP cases: 9
ES: 7
Others: 1

Headlines
- In Mozambique, a wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) was confirmed, linked to the virus detected in Malawi in February [2022] (itself linked to a virus originating in Pakistan). This case is tragic, in particular for the child and affected family. However, given the WPV1 in Malawi, it is not unexpected and confirms the dangers associated with this outbreak. Mozambique and Malawi are continuing to implement a multi-country polio emergency outbreak response. Immediately following detection of this case, the Government of Mozambique publicly declared the outbreak a national public health emergency.

Summary of new polioviruses this week:
- Chad: 1 cVDPV2 case
- Mozambique: 1 WPV1 case and 3 cVDPV2 cases
- Niger: 1 cVDPV2 case and 2 positive environmental samples
- Nigeria: 3 cVDPV2 cases and 5 positive environmental samples
- Togo: 1 cVDPV2 case

• No case of cVDPV2 was reported this week. There are 3 cVDPV2 cases in the country in 2021.

Madagascar
• No case of cVDPV1 was reported this week. The number of 2021 cases remains 13. There is 1 case in 2022.

Malawi
• No case of WPV1 was reported this week. In February [2022], the country reported the 1st WPV1 case on the continent since 2016, with onset of paralysis in November 2021.
• Following the 2nd of a series of multi-country outbreak responses implemented in April [2022], preparations are ongoing in both Malawi and neighbouring countries for the subsequent campaigns.
• In total, at least 4, multi-country campaigns will be implemented. Round 2 was successfully implemented across the country, with almost 3 million children reached, with independent monitoring indicating 94% coverage achieved.
• Lessons learned from the 1st 2 rounds will help inform preparations for the subsequent campaigns, including focusing on further strengthening coordination at all levels, microplanning, training and supervision, social mobilization and increased social mobilization and mass media engagement.
• At the same time, surveillance continues to be strengthened including at critical subnational levels.

Mauritania
• No cVDPV2 positive ES was reported this week. There are 7 positive ES linked to the Jigawa outbreak in 2021.

Mozambique
• On 15 May 2022, the GPEI received the notification through the Global Polio Laboratory Network of a WPV1 from Mozambique, isolated from an AFP case in the country. Initial sequencing of the virus suggests it is linked to the virus detected in Malawi in February [2022], though further analyses are ongoing.
• The case had onset of paralysis on 25 Mar 2022, from Changara district, Tête province.
• Mozambique is also affected by a cVDPV2, with 3 cases reported this week; 2 in Nampula and 1 in Manica. There are 4 cVDPV2 cases reported in 2022 and 2 in 2021.
• The Government of Mozambique has declared both strains to be national public health emergencies.
• This case is of course tragic, particularly for the child and the family affected. However, given detection of WPV1 in Malawi in February [2022], it is not unexpected. It confirms the dangers associated with this virus, and how rapidly it can spread across wide geographic reasons and hence the need to implement large-scale response across large geographic areas.
• Mozambique has been actively participating in the multi-country emergency outbreak response implemented in south east Africa in response to the detected WPV, with 2 rounds already conducted, the most recent at end April [2022], with more than 4.2 million children vaccinated. This case had onset of paralysis before the start of the multi-country campaigns, and therefore does not represent breakthrough transmission following the start of the campaigns.
• Disease surveillance in the country continues to be strengthened, together with neighbouring countries, as part of the ongoing multi-country response.
• A full case investigation is now being launched, supported by the African Rapid Response Team, in order to more clearly identify the risk associated with this case, and further sensitive and target response activities as needed.
• At the same time, the response to cVDPV2 is also continuing, with focus being on rapidly raising immunity to both type 1 and type 2 polio among the population.
• Detection of this most recent case underscores the appropriateness of the large-scale, rapid, multi-country emergency outbreak response across south-east Africa, in line with revised international polio outbreak response standard operating procedures.
• The overriding priority is to continue to implement the subregional emergency response, by continuing to conduct large-scale, rapid and high-quality response campaigns.
• The primary concern is to ensure no further children and families are affected by paralysis, and to rapidly again stop this outbreak once and for all.

Niger
• 1 case of cVDPV2 was reported in Maradi making it the 1st in 2022. There are 17 cases reported in 2021.
• 2 cVDPV2 positive ES were reported; 1 each in Maradi and Niamey.

Nigeria
• 3 cases of cVDPV2 were reported; 2 in Kwara and 1 in Sokoto bringing the number of 2022 cases to 24. The number of 2021 cases remains 415.
• 5 cVDPV2 positive ES were reported; 1 each in Bauchi and Lagos and 3 in Zamfara.

Occupied Palestinian Territory
• No cVDPV3 positive ES were reported this week.
• Preparations are under way for a bivalent oral poliovirus vaccination campaign using fixed sites and mobile teams in Bethlehem and Jerusalem, with R1 in mid-May [2022] and R2 a month later [June 2022].

[The above weekly report highlights the ongoing challenges. There is the official confirmation of the WPV1 case in Mozambique -- "Initial sequencing of the virus suggests it is linked to the virus detected in Malawi in February 2022, though further analyses are ongoing" -- leaving the possibility this was due to circulation of the same virus from Malawi vs a 2nd importation. See section [2] below for an interesting series of observations related to the WPV1 in Africa.

Equally disconcerting is the number of countries with ongoing cVDPV circulation, a sign of lower vaccination coverages and high risk of introduction and circulation of the WPV. In the past week 5 countries have confirmed AFP cases associated with cVDPV2 infections (Chad, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Togo). In the preceding 2 weekly reports there was an additional country with a cVDPV2 associated AFP case (DR Congo) and 2 additional countries with positive environmental samples with cVDPV2 (Djibouti, Yemen).

A map showing the locations of each confirmed case of polio worldwide in the past 12 months can be found at https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/. One can see cases of cVDPV in a band across Africa and in Israel, Ukraine, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan; cVDPV1 in Madagascar and Yemen, and WPV1 in Afghanistan and Pakistan. - Mod.MPP]

[2] Comment re: WPV1 importations
Date: Thu 19 May 2022
From: T Jacob John [edited]
<tjacobjohn@yahoo.co.in>


Earlier, in November 2021, a child in Malawi had wild type 1 polio, virus imported from Pakistan, diagnosis clinched in February 2022. Now in May 2022, in neighboring Mozambique, another case, also due to imported wild type 1 polio virus from Pakistan. Since Malawi and Mozambique share a border, the moderator raises a question as to whether this is next generation case from 1st importation or a 2nd importation [vs circulation in the geographic area - Mod.MPP]. The genetic sequence was reportedly of 2 lineages in Pakistan, both obviously closely related. As there was a massive OPV campaign in both countries following the detection of the Malawi case, it stands to reason that the Mozambique case was due to a second importation.

Pakistan has had only 1 case of WPV-1 polio in 2021 and 3 so far in 2022. That was claimed as the best news in decades -- as there were 147 cases in 2019 and 84 in 2020. However as a cup spills only when full, poliovirus would have been circulating widely in Pakistan to lead to 2 exportations within 7 months. Another clue is from the age of those 3 polio children in Pakistan: 1 year, 15 months and 2 years. Had virus circulation been retarded, the age of polio should have been far above the pre-vaccine-era median age, which was about 18 months.

How was poliovirus imported to Malawi and Mozambique? Most unlikely via human-feces-contaminated food/water (alluded to by Moderator [by media report, not moderator - Mod.MPP]) but most likely to be via infected humans -- but the critical question is children or adults? Were there child travelers from Pakistan or only adults?

The virus had been spilling clue after clue for years as if in a treasure hunt game but the experts had been missing them also for over 20 years. If we explore the hypothesis that silently infected (obviously re-infected) adults are infecting infants and children in Pakistan, now we have 2 clues: one, transmission nearly was interrupted when adults wore masks to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in 2020 and 2021 and 2nd, adults carried poliovirus from Pakistan to Malawi and Mozambique. Several previous episodes of importations were also through adult travelers.

It is high time that an "independent external technical audit" is conducted on the global polio eradication program to find out if vaccination tactics are appropriate for polio epidemiology, public health ethics and health economics.

[As always, Professor T Jacob John's comments and observations are very welcome. Information on the known history of travel between Malawi and Pakistan, and Mozambique and Pakistan including age of travelers would be very helpful here. Given the decades of vaccination efforts, susceptible adults are most likely present, having been protected through a possible circle of immunized peers surrounding them. - Mod.MPP]
