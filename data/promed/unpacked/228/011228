UK Government: Spinal cord found in imported beef
-------------------------------------------------
Spinal cord [tissue has been found in beef imported from The Netherlands
into the UK. Bovine spinal cord is classified as specified risk material
(SRM) and is therefore among those parts of the animal most likely to
contain BSE infectivity. Under European law, SRM must be removed
immediately after slaughter, stained, and disposed of safely. The discovery
was made yesterday (Tuesday, 7 Aug 2001) in one out of 200 quarters of beef
being unloaded at ADM, Eastbourne. The receiving company was not
responsible for the problem. The beef came from Domburg Vlees bv,
Bodegraven, The Netherlands.
The beef quarter involved has been detained under the Products of Animal
Origin (Import and Export) Regulations, pending its disposal which will be
supervised by the Meat Hygiene Service. The rest of the consignment was
checked by the MHS and found to be in full compliance with the legislation.
The Chief Veterinary Officer of The Netherlands and the European Commission
have been notified of this breach The name of the Dutch abattoir concerned
will be added to the list of European abattoirs from which beef containing
spinal cord has been imported into the UK.
While SRM is among those parts of the animal most likely to contain BSE
infectivity, the results so far of BSE tests conducted on healthy cattle
across the EU have been described as encouraging, tending to indicate that
there is no massive, hidden BSE epidemic in Europe. In The Netherlands
there were only 2 positive tests out of 120 873 animals tested between
January and the end of May this year.

The following table gives cumulative figures for the numbers of healthy
cattle tested for BSE from January to the end of May 2001, across all EU
Member States. It does not include BSE suspect animals (those reported as
BSE suspects) nor "at risk" animals (defined as those found dead-on-farm;
emergency slaughtered animals, and those sent for normal slaughter but
found to be sick at ante-mortem inspection). Adult cattle are defined as
those aged 24 months or over.

France: New case of BSE
-----------------------
A case of mad cow disease has been found in the province of Drome in
southeastern France, the first ever case found in that region. The milk
cow, one of an 80-cow troup, was found with symptoms of the Bovine
Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) and died on 25 Jul 2001. A test was done
and the newly published results proved that it involves BSE, reported
Agence France-Presse on Friday.

UK Food agency on trail of low grade meat
-----------------------------------------
Food standards chiefs yesterday announced plans to trace the exact use of
low grade meat products over the past 20 years as scientists try to
establish how many consumers have been put at risk of developing the human
form of BSE, variant CJD. Most attention will focus on the use of
mechanically recovered meat (MRM) from cattle, a prime suspect as the means
of spreading the infection from animals to people. The meat - scraps
blasted off bones - was used in sausages, pies and burgers.

[The Industry has been accused of being reluctant to provide details about
its use, which was banned only in 1995. It may be a factor in explaining
why so many young people are succumbing to the disease. New attempts will
also be made to establish what use was made of brains and spinal cord,
banned 6 years earlier. The food standards agency and the food industry say
it may be difficult to get more details, but scientists on the government's
spongiform encephalopathy advisory committee have grown increasingly
frustrated trying to get the information about MRM.

The food standards agency said manufacturers had told it they would
cooperate. "There may be some limitations on the amount and type of
information available, because there is no requirement under current food
law for meat manufacturers to keep a record of such information. "In
addition, it may be difficult to trace some meat producers and butchers
from the 1970s and 1980s."

The British Meat Manufacturers Association was not commenting in detail
yesterday, but in June, Celia Bennett, its director, said: "With the best
will in the world, it is probably going to be difficult to get the sort of
picture a scientist would want."

The scientists, as well as trying to predict the eventual size of the
epidemic of variant CJD, which has been identified in 106 Britons, are also
seeking to establish common factors in the diet. An investigation at
Queniborough, Leicestershire, near where 5 victims have lived, suggested a
combination of factors, including traditional slaughtering methods
contaminating carcasses, was responsible. Eight other clusters are also
being examined.

Estimates by the Leatherhead food research association and the meat and
livestock commission suggest that in a "worst case" during the 1980s, a
100g meat product including MRM might have contained just over a quarter of
a gram of spinal cord. MRM was widely used in schools, hospitals, prisons
and the armed services. It was also used in some baby food during the
1980s. By 1995, 6 large meat plants were still processing beef MRM. In the
early 1980s, as many as 230 000 brains may have been bought from butchers,
according to a study by the Leatherhead body some years ago.
