A 65 year old mainland woman is in critical condition after being diagnosed with the deadly H7N9 [avian influenza virus], Guangdong [province] health authorities said on Monday night [16 Dec 2013]. The woman, a retiree from Jiangcheng district in Yangjiang city [Guangdong province], was confirmed to be the 4th [human] case of H7N9 avian influenza virus infection in the province.

The case [was identified] a day after the Health and Family Planning Commission of Guangdong announced a case involving a 39 year old Dongguan man, who is also in a critical condition after being diagnosed with the potentially fatal bird flu strain. Authorities said clinical experts had been sent to Yangjiang by the commission to provide medical guidance and conduct an epidemiological investigation.

A total of 142 human cases of H7N9 bird flu have been confirmed so far in China, including 51 cases in Zhejiang, 33 in Shanghai, 28 in Jiangsu [provinces] and a handful of cases across Jiangxi, Fujian, Anhui, and Henan provinces. Shandong, Hunan and Beijing have confirmed 2 cases of H7N9 cases and a solitary case has been confirmed in Hebei.

[The avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses comprise one subgroup of the larger group of H7 viruses that normally circulate among birds. A number of human infections (now 142) caused by the H7N9 virus have been reported in eastern China, mostly in the Yangtze River Delta region since late March 2013. Some of the patients have died of severe pneumonia brought on by the virus.

The features of this new case, a 65 year old woman, are consistent with those of the 3 other H7N9 cases hospitalised in Guangdong province within the past few days: that is, direct infection from poultry (often traded in wet markets), no onward transmission of infection to other humans, and frequently severe illness (and in some cases fatal outcome particularly in elderly patients with co-morbidities). These recent cases in Guangdong province are likely to be the result of a relaxation in the marketing of poultry.
