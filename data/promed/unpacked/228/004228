Spread of diarrhea and other water borne diseases has claimed 10 lives in
the southeastern district of Dhanusha during the past two weeks. Minister
of State for Health Bhakta Bahadur Balayar informed the House of
Representatives today that the disease had spread in 10 Village Development
Committees (VDCs) in the district since the Nepali new year on April 14.
Besides the 10 people who succumbed to the disease, another 754 were also
suffering and some of them have been hospitalized. Chakkar village was the
worst hit with five of the fatalities while Sawel and Sonigama
villages had two fatalities each. Medical teams with doctors and necessary
medication have been dispatched to the area from Kathmandu, Minister
Balayar said.
Health officials say drinking of contaminated water was the main cause for
the spread of the disease.
