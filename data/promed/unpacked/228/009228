With reference to the Pro-MED reports on the outbreak of equine influenza (EI) in Malaysia (20150907.3629570, 20150905.3626182 and 20150828.3608767), the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA) has conducted an investigation and there is no evidence that the 4 horses transhipped from New Zealand via Singapore to Malaysia had any suspicion of respiratory diseases or exposure to resident horses in Singapore.

The 4 horses were part of a consignment from New Zealand that had 17 other horses to be imported to Singapore. All 21 horses were clinically healthy on post-arrival examination and complied with Singapore's import and transshipment requirements. The horses to be transshipped through Singapore have to be tested negative for EI prior to export from the source country. All horses to be imported for residency in Singapore have to be vaccinated against EI prior to export.

The 4 horses to be transshipped to Malaysia travelled by road under official veterinary escort through a short transit within the same day. There was no contact with other horses along the journey in Singapore. The other 17 horses have completed 14 days post-arrival quarantine in the Singapore Equine Quarantine Station and were healthy throughout.

EI is a notifiable disease in Singapore and was last detected in Singapore in 1977. Thereafter, strict import controls and surveillance have prevented subsequent incursion of EI. There have been no outbreaks of EI in Singapore since 1977 and Singapore remains free from EI.

To prevent the incursion of EI from Malaysia, Singapore has temporarily suspended the import of horses from Malaysia until the outbreak is resolved.

Please refer to our media release for more information http://www.ava.gov.sg/docs/default-source/press-releases/media-release---suspension-of-import-of-horses-from-malaysia.pdf

Further to our email of 10 Sep 2015, we would like to provide additional information regarding the samples received for testing at AVA's [Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore] Animal Health Laboratory. AVA received 25 individual nasopharyngeal swabs on 31 Aug 2015 from Malaysia's Selangor Turf Club requesting testing for equine influenza virus (EIV) and equine herpesvirus (EHV) I and IV, and routine bacteriology. The swabs were from 25 horses at the Club that were exhibiting acute respiratory illness.

EIV was detected in 24/25 nasopharyngeal swabs via RRT-PCR whilst EHV I and IV was not detected in all 25 swabs. EI virus has been isolated from 5 of the 24 cases to date and sequencing indicates that the outbreak strain is H3N8 subtype, American lineage, Florida sublineage, clade 1. Bacteriology culture of the swabs mainly yielded _E. coli_, _Streptococcus equi_ subspecies _zooepidemicus_, and _Klebsiella pneumoniae_.

[OIE has not received notification of equine influenza from New Zealand, which is free of equine influenza. This forum is not designed to point fingers between countries or to make judgments, rather it is an information resource. These emails point to an equine influenza confirmation, but there is not an identified source of the problem. - Mod.TG
