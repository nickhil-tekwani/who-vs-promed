[Further to our commentary about the need for Indonesia's notification on
an outbreak in the province Papua (see 20060517.1387), we have received the
following corrective/complementary observation from Dr Mike Dunn, who is
gratefully acknowledged. - Mod.AS]
Date: Thu, 18 May 2006
From: Dr MJ Nunn <mike.nunn@daff.gov.au>

Indonesia formally notified OIE on 27 Apr 2006 (see
<http://oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_21.HTM#Sec2>; in its first report to OIE
since 6 Jan 2006) of the occurrence in March of H5N1 HPAI in a village near
Manokwari in the north west part of the western half of the island of New
Guinea (in a part of [West] Papua Province that Indonesia now calls Irian
Jawa [Jaya] Barat Province): 15 birds were reported dead and 350 destroyed.
This outbreak was previously reported in an article (in Bahasa Indonesian)
in the Manokwari Post on 7 Apr 2006 (that does not appear to have been
picked up by other media).
Some recent media reports included mention of the outbreak in articles
covering a FAO/WHO/Asia Pacific governments' meeting this week in Jakarta
'to discuss food security, poverty and preparing for disasters' (such as
"Bird Flu Infects Indonesia's Papua Province as Virus Moves East'"
<http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000087&sid=a2El9mrRXDkY&refer=top_world_news>).
Reuters news service has since also reported it
(<http://today.reuters.com/News/CrisesArticle.aspx?storyId=SP212447>), as
included in the ProMED-mail posting.
Despite this recent media coverage, the outbreak referred to occurred 2
months ago, and appears to have been quickly and effectively eradicated.

[The location of Manokwari can be seen on the map at:
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/ID/9/Manokwari.html>. New Guinea, the
world's 2nd largest island after Greenland, is politically divided into 2
sections: the Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Irian Jaya in the west
and the independent country of Papua New Guinea in the east. See map at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Westpapua.png>. This outbreak has been
the closest one to Australia so far. - Mod.AS]
