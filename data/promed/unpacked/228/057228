There have been 2 outbreaks of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) on poultry farms in the central state of Chhattisgarh.

The Indian veterinary authority sent an immediate notification dated 5 Aug 2013 to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE).

The report describes 2 outbreaks of HPAI at farms in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh, both starting on 30 Jul 2013.

Of the 2149-strong flock at Anjora, the poultry production unit at the College of Veterinary Sciences and Animal Husbandry in Durg, 464 birds died.

At a government poultry farm in Jagadalpur, there were 3600 affected birds including 2392 deaths in the flock of 6293.
