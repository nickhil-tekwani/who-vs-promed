Two persons have died in the last 3 days, and 10 others are in critical condition after being afflicted with anthrax in Dabuguda village in Renga panchayat under Kashipur block in Odisha's Rayagada district. The reason behind the spread of the disease is not known yet.

A medical team from Kashipur Community Health Centre has rushed to Dabuguda. The team, which is camping in the village, is treating the afflicted.

Anthrax is a rare disease caused by the spores of the bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_. It causes enlargement of the spleen and is also known as spleen fever or "wool sorter's disease". The bacterium is transmitted from animals to humans, and the disease is caused by eating [contaminated] meat, according to experts.

[Anyone checking our postings [see below] will know that anthrax is anything but a rare disease in Odisha. It routinely is found afflicting humans as well as its normal livestock and wildlife hosts. This outbreak is presently in the hands of the physicians. Hopefully, the public health people will back trace on these patients and possibly others yet to be noted and, with their veterinary colleagues, find the source.

It is clear that Odisha needs an effective anthrax livestock control and surveillance programme to reduce the risks to both livestock and the people of Odisha.

Rayagada is in southern Odisha, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayagada_district. - Mod.MHJ
