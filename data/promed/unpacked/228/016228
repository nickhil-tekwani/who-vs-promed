Lethal maize disease outbreak to cut output significantly
---------------------------------------------------------
A disease that infects corn has been found in Oromia and Southern Regional States [and] has the potential to cause a great deal of harm. Maize Lethal Necrosis Disease (MLND) infects and kills maize. It first surfaced in Kenya [ProMED-mail post 20120117.1012452] and has spread. In Ethiopia, the disease was first observed in the Rift Valley [and is] now threatening parts of [the country].

MLND poses a serious threat to rural livelihoods and food security. Farmers have been told by the Agricultural Ministry to be on the look-out for corn that has a dead growing point, abnormal colours or patterns on leaves, moldy seeds or stems that are stunted or have died back. Extension workers are now being sent out to tell farmers to use certain chemicals to eliminate pests that might spread the problem.

The Ministry of Agriculture [said] that the disease might significantly reduce the annual yield. They say they are trying to alleviate the problem by sending seed inspectors to check for MLND in seed farms. An agronomist said that the government initiative must be strengthened to avoid [a] catastrophe due to the new disease.

In Kenya, varieties are being screened for resistance and tolerance and Ethiopia's Agricultural Ministry says they are inspecting corn at the border to prevent infected maize from coming into the country.

[Maize lethal necrosis (MLN) is caused by co-infection of _Maize chlorotic mottle virus_ (MCMV, genus _Machlomovirus_, transmitted by chrysomelid beetles) and either _Maize dwarf mosaic virus_ (MDMV, genus _Potyvirus_) or _Wheat streak mosaic virus_ (WSMV, genus _Tritimovirus_). It has been reported from the Americas and some locations in Europe.

MLN as well as MCMV were reported for the 1st time in Africa from Kenya in 2012 (ProMED-mail post 20130123.1510727) and the disease is spreading in the region. WSMV has not been reported from Africa, but MDMV is known to occur in the region. MDMV is closely related to _Sugarcane mosaic virus_ (SCMV, genus _Potyvirus_), also present in the area, and both are transmitted by a number of aphid species. SCMV has been reported as the co-infecting potyvirus in Kenya, but transmission in maize seed was previously only reported for MDMV, and not SCMV. However, seed transmission of MLN in Africa is being claimed (but is yet to be proven) and would imply that at least one of its viruses is seed transmitted and that infected seedlings acquire the 2nd additional virus from infectious insect vectors present locally. Thus, the 2 viruses involved in Africa may be MCMV, which is not seed transmitted, and either seed transmitted MDMV (undifferentiated from SCMV in the diagnosis) or a new strain of SCMV that can be seed transmitted in maize. High genetic divergence of African SCMV strains has been reported (see ProMED-mail post 20140604.2518403) and may support the latter hypothesis.

Symptoms of the individual viruses are synergistically enhanced in MLN and may include leaf mottling and necrosis, distortion of ears, absence of kernels, failure to produce tassels, as well as stunting, premature aging and death of plants. Symptoms may disappear during the growing season leaving plants with latent infections but reduced yield as virus reservoirs and making disease monitoring difficult. Infectious vector insects may be carried by wind over long distances. Disease management may include crop rotation, certified clean seeds, control of vector species and weedy reservoir hosts, as well as use of crop cultivars or hybrids with reduced sensitivity to the viruses. A resistance breeding programme has been set up in Kenya (as mentioned above) screening a large set of diverse pre-commercial hybrids from public and private institutions.
