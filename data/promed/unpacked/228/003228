11 wild animals have died of suspected anthrax in eastern Caprivi since
June 2005, Regional Governor Bernard Sibalatani told The Namibian
yesterday. This is the same area where the disease broke out in September
2004, leaving more than 50 animals dead.
Sibalatani said officials from the Ministries of Environment and
Agriculture had informed him this week that 6 buffaloes and 5 elephants
found dead in the area along the Chobe River had anthrax symptoms. He said
this area stretched from Kasika to Masikili, close to Botswana's Chobe
National Park, where hundreds of animals died of the disease during 2004.
The animal carcasses were discovered last week.
Sibalatani said after he was briefed on the matter, it was decided to
inform people on the precautions they should take. "We have already
launched the campaign on the NBC Silozi [radio] service here," said the
Governor. When anthrax broke out in the Caprivi Region last September, some
people were hospitalised after they touched or ate infected carcasses.
The Deputy Director of Parks and Wildlife Management in the Ministry of
Environment and Tourism, Sacky Namugongo, told The Namibian yesterday that
preliminary tests had shown that the 11 animals had in fact died of
anthrax. However, the blood had been sent to laboratories in Windhoek for
further tests, he said. The carcasses have been burnt.
The Environment Ministry has sent teams to the area to monitor the
situation, while the Ministry of Agriculture is set to vaccinate cattle in
the affected area. People in the Caprivi are urged not to touch or eat the
meat of any animals found dead in the veld.

[This appears to be an ongoing problem in this region of the Eastern
Caprivi Strip and the adjacent areas of Botswana and Zambia. It might be
constructive if the relevant regional officials of the 3 countries put
their heads together on this and came up with a common plan to deal with
it. Otherwise it will merely reappear each year and swing back and forth
from one country to the other. Apart from vaccinating livestock, another
logical response would be to better monitor the sale of meats in the
various markets to prevent meat from infected animals -- whether livestock
or wildlife -- finding its way into domestic meals. - Mod.MHJ]
