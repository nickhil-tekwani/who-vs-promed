The Canadian experience with use of meningococcal group C vaccine to
control focal outbreaks may be of use (Meningococcal disease in Canada:
1991-92. Can J Publ Hlth 1992;83:5-6 and following articles). A new
serotype of group C first appeared in Canada in 1986. School-based
outbreaks, mainly in adolescents, were reported from Quebec and Ontario in
1989, with high proportion of fulminant disease and death.
Control of the outbreaks in Ontario then and subsequently has been based on
focal use of group C vaccine in school with 2 or more cases. On occasion
(Ottawa, Kitchener-Waterloo), the vaccine was applied to entire town rather
than just school. In Quebec, a province-wide vaccination campaign was
undertaken.
Both the Ontario and Quebec approaches have been effective and it is not
possible to determine which is better. The focal use of vaccine is much
easier to apply, costs less, and is much less disruptive to the general
population and the public health departments.

[Now we are getting somewhere, thanks to our neighbors. It would be useful
to hear from someone involved in or knowledgeable about the response to the
Rhode Island outbreak concerning strains of meningococcus isolated from
those patients, and the relationship of those data to the rationale for
widespread immunization. - Mod.ES
