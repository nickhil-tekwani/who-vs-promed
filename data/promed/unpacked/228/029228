The National Center for Disease Control and Medical Statistics of
Georgia (NCDC) has received urgent notification from the Tbilisi
Infectious Diseases Hospital: A 46-year-old man living in the village
Zemo Ren [also spelled Zemo Rene], Kaspskiy [also spelled Kaspi]
District (Eastern Georgia, an endemic focus of tularemia) was
admitted and hospitalized in the Tbilisi Infectious Diseases Hospital
on 15 Jan 2007 with a clinical diagnosis of tularemia. According to
the epidemiological history, the same symptoms had been observed in
other inhabitants of the same village as well. NCDC experts visited
Zemo Rene village for further investigation.
Epidemiological investigation was conducted, and 18 cases of
tularemia were identified (including the one case reported from
Tbilisi Infectious Diseases Hospital). The ulceroglandular form of
tularemia was manifested in all patients. According to the
interviews, the 1st symptoms of tularemia were suspected in early
December 2006, however, tularemia was not diagnosed at that time. The
patients ages ranged from 11 to 75 years. Distribution by sex: 8
female, 10 male.
The blood from all cases was sampled for serological testing. A
4-fold and more increase in the titer was registered in 16 cases. The
blood samples from 2 patients are still being tested. Smears from
tularemic ulcers from 2 patients were tested for bacteria using real
time PCR. Results were positive in both cases.
The drinking water for Zemo Rene village comes from the local small
spring; it is collected in an open reservoir and is supplied without
any filtration. Water from the reservoir was investigated as well,
and presence of _Francisella tularensis_ was confirmed.
Treatment for all patients was started. Villagers are under
surveillance for additional cases.
