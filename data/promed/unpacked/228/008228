Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - update, 4 Oct 2013
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHO has been informed of an additional 6 laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in Saudi Arabia.

The 6 new patients are from Riyadh region with ages from 14 to 79 years old, of which 3 are women and 3 men. The dates of onset of the patients range from 15 to 26 Sep 2013. One patient has mild symptoms while the others are hospitalized. Three patients are contacts of previously confirmed cases with MERS-CoV, 2 are reported to have had no exposure to animals or to a confirmed case, and there is no information on exposure of one patient.

Globally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 136 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 58 deaths.

Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Health care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

[The above WHO summary gives the global total of laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection as 136, including 58 deaths. The source of the MERS-CoV has not as yet been identified. It appears as though there are ongoing clusters of transmission, but the actual numbers of new clusters cannot be identified from the information available. The Hajj will be beginning in the coming week [starting 13 Oct 2013], and there are obvious concerns re: implications for MERS-CoV transmission in the absence of knowing the actual source of introduction from bats to humans.
