["Sheep pox and goat pox (capripox) are endemic in central and North Africa, the Middle East, India, China (People's Rep. of), Viet Nam and Chinese Taipei. Capripox is caused by strains of capripoxvirus and produces a characteristic clinical disease in fully susceptible breeds of sheep and goats and would usually be difficult to confuse with any other disease. In indigenous animals, generalized disease and mortality are less common, although they are seen where disease has been absent from an area or village for a period of time, when intensive husbandry methods are introduced, or in association with other disease agents, such as peste des petits ruminants virus or foot and mouth disease virus". http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.07.13_S_POX_G_POX.pdf

"In many countries where sheep pox and goat pox are endemic, effective and timely disease reporting, eradication activities, response capabilities, and established veterinary infrastructure do not exist or are underfunded. Sheep pox and goat pox can easily go undetected and/or unreported. These factors can foster the persistence of sheep pox and goat pox in these endemic areas". https://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/emergency_management/downloads/sop/sppv_gtpv_ee.pdf

Capripox is not infectious to humans. - Mod.CRD
