As requested in the posting today [16 Aug 2021; see Japanese encephalitis & other - India (09): (BR) comment 20210816.8597921], I have verified with the state immunisation officer that neither the 1.5-year-old child who died on 11 Aug [2021] nor the 6-year-old child who died on 12 Aug [2021] had lab evidence of Japanese encephalitis.

The exact disease was not diagnosed, and the "syndromic" term AES [acute encephalitis syndrome] was applied to both. We will never know the real diagnosis.

[Because Japanese encephalitis (JE) is often included within the acute encephalitis syndrome diagnosis, at the time these 2 cases were posted, the possibility of JE was open. Dr. John's immediate response indicates that JE was ruled out, leaving the specific etiologies of these 2 cases unknown as Dr. John states. We thank Dr. John for his swift clarification of this point. - Mod.TY
