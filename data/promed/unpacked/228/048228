In the Lviv region, 3 women were bitten by a rabid marten that ran into the village yard from the forest. The animal bit the legs of 2 women, the hand of the 3rd. Now they are undergoing anti-rabies therapy.

The incident happened in one of the villages of the Skoliv district.

At the scream of the women, the owner of the house ran out, killed the animal and called the veterinarians. Doctors took the marten for examination and confirmed that it was sick with rabies.

The ambulance took the women to the Skolivska Central Hospital. Then they were sent to the central district hospital in Stryi, Oksana Yaremko, director of the Skoliv Central Hospital, told reporters.

Now the women are undergoing outpatient treatment under the supervision of doctors, and on 12 Aug 2022 they should return to the Skolivska Central Hospital.

Earlier, a case of rabies was recorded in a homeless cat in Kyiv.

We will remind you that rabies is an acute infectious disease of animals and humans with 100% lethality, which affects the central nervous system and even leads to death. An infected animal can infect a person through a bite, scratch, or saliva. In order to be saved from the disease, it is necessary to get an emergency vaccination and inject immunoglobulin.

At the same time, in some cases, vaccination against rabies is not required after animal bites.

[In Europe, the oral rabies vaccination (ORV) of red foxes (_Vulpes vulpes_), the main reservoir of rabies in the continent, was developed in the late 1970s and has demonstrated its effectiveness in the eradication of the disease in western and some central European countries. Besides red foxes, rabies is common in raccoon dogs (_Nyctereutes procyonoides_, introduced in Europe), and also occurs in grey wolves (_Canis lupus_), arctic foxes (_Alopex lagopus_), badgers (_Meles meles_), pine martens (_Martes martes_) and polecats (_Mustela putorius_). Individuals of other species may occasionally be infected. It is noteworthy that recently there was another report of a rabid marten in Ukraine (ProMED post 20220701.8704188). - Mod.PMB
