September 28, 1997
At the 37th annual Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and
Chemotherapy (ICAAC) sponsored by the American Society for Microbiology
in Toronto, Canada today:
Taiwan
------
Dr. C.C. Chiou, a pediatrician from the
Veterans Central Hospital in Kachsiung, southern Taiwan, reported the
incidence of nasopharyngeal carriage of penicillin-resistant
_Streptococcus pneumoniae_ among children attending regional day care
centers and kindergartens.
_S. pneumoniae_ was isolated from 396 of 1397 children tested (ages 2
months-7 years). Two hundred sixty-eight (68%) of the _S. pneumoniae_
isolates were resistant to penicillin, as determined by an oxacillin
disc diffusion screening test. She ws uncertain as to the reason for
this "astonishing" rate of carriage of penicillin-resistant strains in
the community at large, but pointed out that most antibiotics are
readily available over the counter in Taiwan, so the potential for
overuse and incorrect use is great.
United States of America
------------------------
Another study presented in the same session by E.O Mason et al. surveyed
4000 isolates of _S. pneumoniae_ from 79 clinical laboratories in the US
by submitting them to a single laboratory for susceptibility testing.
Overall, 65% of the isolates were found susceptible to penicillin, 23%
of intermediate susceptibility, and 12% resistant. Penicillin resistance
frequency varies from 27-50% at various sites in the US according to Dr.
Mason [I presume that the intermediate and resistant strains are
combined in the numbers - Mod.ES].
[Penicillin resistance in clinical isolates of _S. pneumoniae_ is reported
to be exhibited by from about 4-70% of isolates by various investigators
around the globe. In the US, clinical laboratories standardize their
antimicrobial susceptibility tests using NCCLS guidelines. It may be
difficult to compare frequencies of resistant isolates reported by
investigators in different countries, since procedures for
standardization and quality control vary. Nontheless, it is likely
that antibiotic resistance will become prevalent when antibiotics are
used without the oversight of health care professionals, or when these
professionals "over-use" antimicrobial therapies - Mod.ES]
