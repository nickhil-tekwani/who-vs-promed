Cholera in Liberia - update
---------------------------
New figures for the period 30 May to 29 June 2003 have been reported: 1280
cases, including 15 deaths (see previous report:
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_07_03a/en/>). With 350 new cases reported
during the period 30 Jun to 6 Jul 2003, the total number of cholera cases
in Monrovia is now 1630, including 15 deaths. The security situation still
makes it difficult to obtain exact numbers of cases and deaths.
Nongovernmental organizations, including MERLIN and Medecins sans
Frontieres (France and Belgium) have established diarrheal units at centers
for internally displaced people in the city.
The World Health Organization (WHO), with the United Nations children's
fund (UNICEF), is working with the Ministry of Health to finalize plans to
extend the mass chlorination activities to communities in Monrovia and its
surrounding areas. In addition, WHO is distributing health education
materials on cholera prevention and control to health facilities and
communities.
