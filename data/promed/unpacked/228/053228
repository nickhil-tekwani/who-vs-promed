a. Table.
From 01 Jul to 01 Sep 2008, BTV 8 has been
confirmed in 522 ruminants in Germany. The
majority of cases have been confirmed in Northern
and Southern Germany in regions that experienced
only low level of virus circulation during 2007.
412 cases are in cattle
106 cases are in sheep
1 case in goats
2 cases in mixed holdings
1 case in farmed deer

b. Press release
Since the beginning of the vaccination campaign,
20 May 2008, 17 M doses of vaccine for cattle and
3 M doses of vaccine for sheep have been applied.
The Ministry states that, withion 3 months,
approximately 70 percent of the cattle and 90
percent of the sheep and goats have been
vaccinated, which means an advanced coverage rate.

A vaccination field trial, supervised by the
Friedrich Loeffler Institute, has shown very
high levels of immunity after vaccination in
cattle and sheep. Therefore the Ministry is
expecting that a high level of protection can be
achieved in susceptible ruminants.

Compared with about 20 000 farms affected during
the 2007 season, their number this year is, so
far, about 500. This situation is regarded to be
the outcome of the successful vaccination campaign.

Subject: Bluetongue - Extension of the zone BTV-1 and BTV-8
-----------------------------------------------------------
The confirmation of a new case of BTV-1 in the
Dordogne area results in a modification of the
perimeter zones. There is an extension of the
Regulated Zone in Aveyron, Correze, Lot, Herault and the High Vienna.

10 800 cases of BTV-8 during 2008 are derived
from viral circulation during 2008. 255 new cases
of BTV-1 result from viral circulation during 2008.

For information: 15 569 cases of BTV have been
reported during 2007 (including 3 cases of BTV serotype 1).

For information: 6020 BTV cases reported during
the first half of 2008 (of which 6 cases of
BTV-1) were the results of viral circulation of 2007.

[Though the French figures are somewhat complex,
clearly France is witnessing a renewed
circulation of the virus which is more intensive
than the one recorded in the other European
countries where the virus has already reappeared
during 2008, namely Germany, the Netherlands,
Belgium, Luxembourg, Denmark and Switzerland.
BTV-8 seems to continue its spread into southern
France, while BTV-1 shows a clear trend to spread
in a north-eastern direction. This can be seen in
the map, available at the above URL (red dots = BTV-8; blue dots = BTV-1).

It will be interesting to note if and how many of
the recorded cases involved animals which had
gone through the vaccination as prescribed (see
also item 4), including their respective ages, species and locations.

So far, no renewed circulation of the virus has
been recorded on the British isles. -Mod. AS].

How does bluetongue virus survive through the winter?
-----------------------------------------------------
In 2006, Bluetongue virus ­- which infects
livestock ­- reached Northern Europe for the 1st
time. Some people thought that the outbreak would
be limited to that particular year, as winter was
expected to kill off the midges that host and
spread the disease, bringing the threat of
infection to an end. In actuality, the disease
escalated in the following year, spreading to the
UK. So, how did the virus survive the winter?

Drs. Anthony Wilson, Karin Darpel and Philip
Mellor of the Institute for Animal Health have
discussed this puzzling question in an Unsolved
Mystery article, published in the open access
journal PLoS Biology, freely available to read from publication on 26 Aug 2008.

The answer to this question is of great practical
importance, as it will affect both national and
international trade of ruminants, the livestock
susceptible to infection, and will dictate trade
rules for a long time even after the infection
has passed. The answer is also relevant to how we
can deal with bluetongue and other unpleasant
midge-transmitted diseases in the future.

Dr. Mellor said: "Although the major mechanism of
bluetongue virus spread is undoubtedly that of
Culicoides midges feeding on infected ruminants,
growing the virus and then transmitting it to
further susceptible animals, other mechanisms may
also be at work. These may assume greater
importance during the midge-free season (winter),
such as we in northern latitudes experience."

Wilson and colleagues point out that evidence to
date does not support the winter survival of
bluetongue virus in the eggs of Culicoides
midges. An alternative hypothesis is that, in
mild winters such as that of 2006-07 in northern
Europe, sufficient infected midges might survive
until they become active again in spring. The
midges may enter livestock barns to overwinter. 2
other possibilities for disease endurance during
winter are that bluetongue is spread by some
susceptible species of long-lived ticks and/or by
simple mechanical transmission by _Melophagus
ovinus_, a wingless parasite that lives in the fleece of sheep.

Additionally, there is evidence from Australia
that bluetongue virus can survive in midges and
in a small proportion of infected cattle for 3 to
4 months, which would be long enough for winter
to come and go without killing the virus.

Closer to home, the recent outbreaks of
bluetongue in northern Europe have provided
evidence for a different overwinter
route­transplacental infections; the virus
spreading from an infected pregnant animal to its
fetus, a phenomenon also demonstrated by
experiment. This phenomenon might be particularly
important in cattle, where the long gestation
period of 9 months (4 for sheep) [sic. should
read 5. - Mod.AS] means that the virus can grow
and survive within a fetus, at just the right
temperature, throughout the coldest of winters.
There is also circumstantial evidence that cattle
could become infected orally if they eat the
afterbirth of an infected offspring from another cow.

As Dr. Mellor summarizes, "Experiments have
revealed a toolbox of possible mechanisms, with
the potential to interact with and complement one another."

sleep in the winter? PLoS Biol 6(8): e210.

For subscribers' convenience, we hereby copy the
concluding chapter "Towards an Explanation":

BTV is not limited to the core vector-borne
disease transmission cycle commonly presented in
textbooks. Multiple vectors and hosts may be
involved, along with such diverse transmission
routes as transplacental, mechanical, and oral
routes. Rather than a single missing link
enabling the virus to persist during the winter
period, experiments have revealed a toolbox of
possible mechanisms, with the potential to
interact with and complement one another. For
example, chronic infection of the uterus could
increase the likelihood of transplacental
transmission, which in turn may create
chronically or latently infected calves. Examples
of BTV overwintering in the literature can be
found ranging from as little as 3 months to 8 or
9. The shortest of these periods could be bridged
by any of several candidate mechanisms, and the
principal difficulty faced by the epidemiologist
is narrowing down the list of suspects. At the
other end of the scale, only a subset of these
mechanisms or the interaction of 2 or more in
sequence would be able to account for longer overwintering periods.

Although several of the mechanisms discussed in
this paper were first suggested decades ago,
interest in confirmatory and quantitative studies
remained low for 2 reasons. Firstly, prior to the
advent of molecular techniques, the subclinical
nature of most BTV infections meant that it was
both difficult and expensive to assert that
transmission had stopped, and then to demonstrate
that the re-emergence of bluetongue in a region
was due to overwintering rather than
reintroduction. Secondly, endemic regions such as
South Africa or the United States have lived with
bluetongue for so long that their agricultural
sectors have adapted to its presence, avoiding
the most susceptible breeds, vaccinating valuable
animals, and accepting small losses rather than
embarking upon expensive eradication programmes.
Mechanisms that are important only for
persistence therefore received little attention.

The recent spread of bluetongue into areas such
as northern Europe, which are both highly
susceptible to the economic effects of the
disease and cold enough that classical
transmission is interrupted for a significant
part of the year, has stimulated field,
laboratory, and analytical research into the
mechanisms by which bluetongue may overwinter in
temperate climes. The next steps for bluetongue
research must be first, to establish these newly
discovered transmission routes beyond reasonable
doubt and second, to determine their importance
for the transmission of BTV in the field.

Some of this work has already begun: for example,
several countries in northern Europe are
conducting field studies to determine how readily
their indigenous vector Culicoides enter animal
housing [See Ref 1] and the Institute for Animal
Health, the Veterinary Laboratories Agency, and
Animal Health are currently collaborating on a
project to determine the degree to which
transplacental transmission of BTV might be
occurring in the current outbreak. Previous
studies of similar diseases may also suggest productive approaches.

For instance, direct surveillance for inactive
adult vectors during the winter confirmed that
they represented a potential mechanism for the
overwintering of WNV, and similar surveillance of
Culicoides populations, possibly via suction
sampling, might shed further light on the
potential for this route to maintain BTV during
the winter months. Such detective work is not
purely of interest for understanding the current outbreak in northern Europe.

Confirmation of transplacental transmission of
BTV in the field, for example, would have drastic
consequences for international trade. However,
the epidemiology of bluetongue and other
vector-borne diseases is determined by a number
of factors, ranging from molecular variation in
virus strains, through regional farm management
and animal husbandry approaches, to spatial and
temporal patterns of change in land use or
climate detectable only via detailed analysis of
high-resolution climate data or remotely sensed imagery.

To achieve a full understanding of the
epidemiology of diseases such as bluetongue will
therefore require not only short-term independent
entomological or veterinary studies but a
commitment to truly interdisciplinary programmes
of study over longer periods, incorporating
approaches ranging in scale from molecular
biology and virology through entomology and
veterinary science to land use and climate
modelling. Perhaps most importantly, the fact
that we are now having to re-examine so many
basic questions about the behaviour of Culicoides
illustrates that we neglect basic studies of the
ecology of insect species capable of acting as vectors of disease at our peril.

The existence of so many potential overwintering
mechanisms for viruses such as BTV and WNV may
also teach us more general lessons about the
capacity for other medically or epidemiologically
important vector-borne diseases to survive in
temperate zones with seasonal vector absence. In
particular, the risk to northern Europe from the
BTV-related epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus
[EHD](which also affects ruminants) and African
horse sickness [AHS] virus (which affects equids)
should be re-evaluated. [Another equine orbivirus
to me mentioned is Equine Encephalosis. - Mod.AS]
Consideration of the routes reviewed here may
also be useful when assessing the risk of
re-emergence of outbreaks of insect-borne viruses
not previously seen in Europe, such as the 2007
outbreak of chikungunya virus in Italy.

The abstract includes, inter alia, the following information:

"_C. obsoletus_/_C. scoticus_ and _C. dewulfi_
occurred also widely and abundantly on sheep and
cattle holdings across the entire affected
region, and during the latter part of the season
showed strong endophily readily entering
livestock buildings in significant numbers to
bite the animals inside (endophagy), which
demonstrates that housing at best offers only
limited protection to livestock from Culicoides attacks."

The reappearance and further spread of BTV-8 in
Western Europe during 2008 [See items 1, 2
above), extending its presence into its 3rd
consecutive year, underlines the significance of
the above observations. - Mod.AS]

[4] Vaccination guidelines, UK
Date: Fri 5 Sep 2008
Source: DEFRA website [abridged and edited]
<http://www.DEFRA.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/notifiable/bluetongue/control/vaccination/vaccination-operational.htm#4>


The following points on BTV-8 vaccination,
selected from the guidelines published by DEFRA,
may be useful for those interested in the
background to the vaccination campaign currently
applied in several European countries.
Subscribers are encouraged to refer to the full document. - Mod.AS]

Bluetongue: Vaccination
-----------------------
1. Key points
DEFRA has placed an order with Intervet for 22.5m
doses of BTV-8 vaccine, and a further order with
Merial for 13m doses. Livestock keepers will be
allowed to administer the vaccine to their
animals. If the animals are vaccinated in order
to be moved out of a Protection Zone for the
purposes of intra-community trade, livestock
keepers should consider the movement
requirements. The vaccine will only be authorised
for use inside Protection Zone, which will be
regularly expanded over the summer in line with
the published vaccination roll-out plan.

2. Vaccination plan
The aim has been to develop a vaccination programme which will:
allow vaccination to be rolled out as quickly as
possible, as vaccine is delivered;
reduce the cost of vaccination to a minimum by
using existing delivery chains and reducing regulatory burdens; and
give farmers the freedom to take business decisions.

Under EU law, vaccination can only be carried out
in a Protection Zone. Once vaccination is
progressing broadly across the Protection Zone,
the intention is to extend or modify the Zone in
order to permit further vaccination, allowing a
phased approach as vaccine comes on-stream.

DEFRAs published vaccination roll-out plan sets
out the priorities for vaccination, and the order
in which it is anticipated that vaccination will be rolled out.

3. Distribution of vaccine and licensing powers
The distribution chain for vaccine will be as follows:
Manufacturer; to
Wholesaler; to
Private vet or pharmacy; to
Livestock keeper.
From the private vet or pharmacy onwards,
possession of vaccine will be strictly licensed
and can only be obtained if it is for immediate
use; we have developed a system to monitor the
distribution of vaccine. The use of vaccine will
also be strictly licensed and will only be able
to be used in a specific zone which equates to an
area in a Protection Zone or a specific area
within a Protection Zone. There is therefore a
responsibility on everyone to ensure that vaccine
is ordered, obtained and used responsibly.

4. Vaccine properties
The Intervet vaccine has been licensed for sheep
and cattle aged over one month. The primary
course of vaccination will consist of one 1ml
dose in sheep and 2 1ml doses in cattle given
approximately 3 weeks apart. Full protection is
established 3 weeks after the primary course.
Thereafter, re-vaccination will be required 2 weeks before the period of risk.

The Merial vaccine has been licensed for sheep
and cattle aged over 3 months. The primary course
of vaccination will consist of one 1ml dose in
sheep and 2 1ml doses in cattle given
approximately one month apart. Thereafter,
re-vaccination will be required 2 weeks before the period of risk.

If used in other ruminant species that are
considered at risk of infection, its use in these
species should be undertaken with care and it is
advisable to test the vaccine on a small number
of animals prior to mass vaccination. The level
of efficacy for other species may differ from
that observed in sheep and cattle.
Vaccination in these species would have to be
undertaken under the cascade system under the
direct personal responsibility of a veterinarian.
There will be no withdrawal periods if the vaccine is used in goats.

It is essential that the data sheet requirements
with regard to storage temperature are strictly
adhered to at all times. No data is available on
the use of the Intervet and Merial vaccines
together. It is therefore recommended that the
same vaccine should be used for the primary
course of vaccination in individual animals
(i.e., the 2 doses in cattle). However, no
problems are anticipated with re-vaccinating
animals which have already received a primary
course of vaccination with a different vaccine.
You should speak to your vet for further advice.

5. Use of vaccines with other medicines
No information is available on the compatibility
of Bluetongue vaccines with any other so the
safety and efficacy of Bluetongue vaccines when
used with any other has not been demonstrated. In
accordance with our usual advice for TB testing,
it is not recommend that medicines -- including
Bluetongue vaccines -- should be administered at
the time of injection of tuberculin (i.e., your
vet's 1st visit) in order to avoid any risk of
interference with the TB test. No problems are
expected with using medicines on the day of the
reading of the skin test (i.e., your vet's 2nd
visit). Please speak to your private vet for further advice.

6. Minimising costs and wastage
Where appropriate, in order to minimise costs and
wastage smallholders are encouraged to either
purchase the smallest, appropriately-sized bottle
or approach their vet about options for
purchasing a smaller amount than a whole bottle.
It is illegal for keepers to share vaccine
bottles but vets are allowed to inject animals at
different premises using the same bottle, or
dispense individual syringes with a smaller
amount (although this is likely to have an effect
on the expected on-farm price). In doing so, it
is important to remember that the cold chain
conditions must be maintained and vaccine must be
used, or disposed of, within 8 hours of opening a bottle.
