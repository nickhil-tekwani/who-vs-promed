In South Africa, symptoms resembling those of citrus leprosis disease (EPPO A1 List) were observed in May 2018 in the Eastern Cape province. _Citrus leprosis N dichorhavirus_ (CiLV-N) was detected on 2 sweet orange (_Citrus sinensis_, Valencia and Navel type) trees in Sundays River Valley, Sarah Baartman District. The virus was then also detected on another farm in the Gamtoos River Valley [same district]. For the moment, the pest status has not been determined by the NPPO [National Plant Protection Organisation] of South Africa.

[Citrus leprosis is a devastating viral disease that only affects _Citrus_ species. Primarily sweet orange varieties (_C. sinensis_) are susceptible. Other citrus species and hybrids have variable levels of resistance and some may not show symptoms serving as latent virus reservoirs. Symptoms may include lesions on fruits, leaves and twigs; premature leaf and fruit drop, defoliation; severe necrosis of new shoots, dieback of branches, bark scaling; reduction of the canopy leading to serious tree decline and significant yield losses. Previously, the disease had only been reported from the Americas where it appears to be spreading.

Currently, 3 different species of citrus leprosis viruses (CiLV) have been described. _Citrus leprosis virus C_ and _C. leprosis virus C2_ (only members of genus _Cilevirus_) occur in the cytoplasm of the host. _C. leprosis N virus_ (genus _Dichorhavirus) occurs in the nucleus of infected cells. Cytoplasmic CiLVs have been shown to be the prevalent type in orchards in the Americas. A number of other viruses related to either of the CiLV types have also been reported to be associated with the disease, such as _Hibiscus green spot virus 2_ and a citrus strain of _Orchid fleck virus_.

The viruses are spread by the flat mite (or false spider mite, _Brevipalpus phoenicis_) and other related mite species. Unlike many other plant viruses, CiLVs does not become systemic, which means each lesion represents a feeding puncture of an infected vector. Infectious mites may be spread with plant material such as budwood or rooted plantlets, the leprosis risk is particularly high for areas where vector species are already present.

Disease management may include cultural methods to reduce virus and vector reservoirs, but mainly relies on controlling the mites. Most currently available miticides are effective and are applied once the vector reaches economic thresholds. Biological control by mite predators is being used occasionally. Disease levels often increase when crop prices fall due to farmers saving costs by reducing chemicals. Crop varieties with increased levels of resistance are available, but none of the commercial sweet orange varieties are resistant to leprosis.

With the above being the 1st report of the disease outside of the Americas, investigating a potential origin and route of introduction will be important for citrus industries worldwide to assess the international biosecurity risk for the viruses.
