A deadly virus is stalking France's coastline, killing at least 60
percent of the young oysters there since 2008 [see commentary].

The 11 Mar 2011 natural disasters destroyed the fishing industry in
Miyagi prefecture, which produced 80 percent of Japan's oyster seeds
in 2009. That is forcing France to abandon plans to import and breed
Miyagi's Pacific oyster species, and find another solution for diners
seeing fewer, and more costly, options.

The French eat about 108 000 metric tons of the mollusks, typically
on the half-shell atop a bed of ice and garnished with a squeeze of
lemon or splash of vinegar. Domestic production fell 38 percent last
year [2010], driving up wholesale prices 20 percent. Some brasseries
in Paris sell the largest oysters for 6.5 euros [USD 9.17] a piece.

France, whose oyster industry was worth about 400 million euros [USD
572 million] in 2010, imported young Miyagi oysters in October 2010
and February 2011 to test their resistance to the virus, a variant of
Ostreid herpesvirus 1, or OsHV-1. That required special permission
from the European Commission to circumvent 1991 restrictions on
importing oysters for breeding.

Test results are expected this month [May 2011], yet "the dramatic
events in Japan in March 2011 have altered the chances of success of
the Japanese track," Veronique Lopes, a spokeswoman for the French
Ministry of Agriculture, said in an e-mail.

The ministry is drawing up a new list of potential importers with
"sufficient health guarantees," she said.

Japanese oysters also are less attractive because of the possibility
that their beds were contaminated by radiation leaking from a damaged
nuclear-power plant on the coast in neighboring Fukushima prefecture,
Lopes said.

The virus is not just a blow to France, Europe's biggest producer.
The global industry, worth at least USD 3.3 billion in 2009, has been
plagued by OsHV-1 in Ireland, England and Australia.

In Ireland, Europe's 2nd-largest producer, about half of the bays
where Pacific oysters are grown have been affected by the virus since
2008. Research has suggested "a very strong association" with imports
of oyster seeds from France, said John Joyce, a spokesman for the
Irish Marine Institute based in Galway.

The virus starts killing oysters when water temperatures top about 16
C (61 F). It has reappeared along the French coast this year [2011]
and mostly affects oysters under one year old, Tristan Renault,
director of the genetics and pathology laboratory at the French
Research Institute for Exploration of the Sea in La Tremblade, said in
a phone interview. Oysters need 3 years to mature, so the past winter
was the 1st to show the effect on supply, Maingam said.

Oyster production declined to 80 000 tons from 130 000 tons last year
[2010] in France, Maingam said. Wholesale prices are 20 percent higher
than a year ago, according to the National Institute of Statistics and
Economic Studies in Paris.

The problem may worsen after 2012, when many of the French colonies
wiped out by the virus would have been ready for the table. That's
also when the Japanese-imported oysters would have been growing.

Miyagi oystermen already have lost this year's [2011] harvesting
season, and they won't be able to plant seeds for the breeding season
typically beginning in July. Fishing and farming were suspended all
along Miyagi's coast because of efforts to locate the 9000 people
still missing after the natural disasters.

The Miyagi oysters, whose scientific name is _Crassostrea gigas_, are
more resistant to infectious diseases than other species and have a
history of being sent abroad to jump start farming or revive crops
devastated by illness. It is now the most widely farmed oyster species
in the world, Renault said.

Miyagi oysters came to France's rescue in the 1970s after the
iridovirus killed most of the oyster population. The oysters also have
been transplanted to more than 30 countries, including the USA, China,
South Korea, Spain and New Zealand. "_Crassostrea gigas_ has been
cultivated all around the world, showing it is capable of adapting to
different environments," Renault said.

Oystermen prefer Miyagi's seeds because the oysters also are free of
a parasite found elsewhere in Japan, Renault said. Now Japan may have
to increase oyster imports to keep prices stable.

[For background and additional information, see commentary in 20101223.4520 and France's OIE reporting since April 2010 on
Herpesvirus OsHV-1 as an emerging disease (spread along the Atlantic
coasts as well as the Mediterranean, including Corsica) at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=9179.

Ireland reported to the OIE, during 2010, 18 foci of an emerging
disease in oysters, suspected as Ostreid herpes virus 1 (OsHV1). See,
with interactive map, at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=9577.


On 3 Dec 2010, the following epidemiological commentary was
submitted:

"Mortalities have been considerable, particularly in seed. Half grown
and adult oysters have also suffered mortalities in some areas, though
at lower levels. Transmission from site to site as well as through the
water is believed to be occurring, but the presence of the virus in
all of these areas last year (2010) and the possibility of latency
makes it impossible to be sure whether the source is introduction of
stock from an infected area or as a result of latent infections in
existing populations. Although mortalities now appear to be at an end,
re-infection of stocks which will be introduced between now and next
summer is anticipated once the temperatures begin to climb again in
June. Between 3 Jun and 5 Aug 2010, OsHV1 uVar strain (was) detected
in all 14 bays, by using PCR and histopathology."
