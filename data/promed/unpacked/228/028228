A 5-year-old child suspected to have encephalitis, a condition that causes inflammation of the brain, died in Bihar's Araria district Monday [30 Dec 2013], taking the toll from this disease to 8 in the last 10 days, officials said.

Araria civil surgeon B.K. Thakur said that while one child died Monday [30 Dec 2013], there were others admitted to hospital with similar symptoms and who were in critical condition.

Last week [23-29 Dec 2013], 2 children, a 4-year-old and a 6-year-old, died of the disease at Belwa panchayat near Araria town, officials said, and 5 children were earlier reported to have died in the district.

Araria district magistrate Ajay Kumar Choudhury said preventive measures have been taken on a war footing since last week, after 5 children succumbed to encephalitis.

A team of health experts from Patna [Bihar state] visited the affected village in Araria 3 days ago [27 Dec 2013], on a directive from Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, to oversee measures to check the spread of the disease.

Encephalitis is an acute inflammation of the brain resulting either from a viral infection or when the body's own immune system mistakenly attacks brain tissue. Children and elderly people, whose immunity is low, are especially prone to fall prey to the disease.

Till now, over 3 dozen children have died of encephalitis in the state this year [2013].

Last year [2012], the disease killed nearly 240 children in Muzaffarpur and Gaya districts of Bihar.

[As in previous reports of encephalitis (often termed locally as acute encephalitis syndrome), the etiology of these cases is unknown. Each year, there are hundreds of encephalitis cases in the area of Uttar Pradesh and neighboring Bihar state. In past reports, the disease has been associated with Japanese encephalitis virus infections and with consumption of contaminated water, suggesting enterovirus infections. Reye syndrome and heat stroke have been suggested as possible causes of encephalitis in the children. However, massive Japanese encephalitis virus vaccination campaigns in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar states have resulted in a significant reduction in cases due to infection with that virus. One hopes that the scientists involved in attempting to determine the etiologies of these undiagnosed cases will continue to attempt to find out what is going on, so that effective, scientifically sound preventive measures may be devised and implemented.
