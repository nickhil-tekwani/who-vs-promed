INFECTIOUS BURSAL DISEASE, PENGUINS - ANTARACTICA
=================================================
Date: Thu, 15 May 1997 04:32:56 -0400
From: Heather Gardner <heathe_gar@antdiv.gov.au>
Today we published our finding of antibodies to an avian pathogen,
infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), in Antarctic penguins - emperor
chicks and Adelie adults. This raises concern for the conservation of avian
wildlife in Antarctica. The finding was published in scientific
correspondence in Nature 15th May.
The investigation was part of an epidemiological survey undertaken in
1995/96 by the Antarctic Division, Dept Environment Sport and Territories,
Australia. The CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratory undertook the
serology and are looking for the virus.
IBDV is relatively resistant to inactivation by heat, desiccation and
chemical agents, and is contagious and highly infectious by the faecal-oral
route. It is likely to remain an environmental contaminant of colonies
between breeding seasons.
Although clinical disease was not apparent in either species of penguin,
further investigation is warranted. The presence of seroreactors near
centres of human activity raises the possibility that the virus may have
been introduced. The size of our chick sample at Edmonson Point was
sufficient to detect a prevalence of in excess of 20% seroreactors
(p<0.05). If IBDV was present in this location, the seroprevalence would be
expected to be similar to that among the equivalent age group of emperor
chicks. Thus the absence of neutralising antibodies in the chicks from this
remote colony of Edmonson Point suggests that this area is free from IBDV
contamination.
A potent source of environmental contamination in Antarctica could have
been from careless or inappropriate disposal of poultry products picked up
by scavenging birds such as the south polar skua (_Catharacta maccormicki_).
Spread within Antarctica could be facilitated through the movement of
people carrying the virus on contaminated footwear, clothing, equipment or
vehicles.
>From stored serum, we are able ascertain that antibodies have been in the
Mawson region for at least 6 years. If IBDV has been brought in by man, it
most likely would have occurred before strict environmental protection
protocols on the disposal of poultry products were adopted by the Treaty
Nations.
At this time, it must be assumed that IBDV may be pathogenic in Antarctic
penguins, and is likely to be spread by human activity. The potential for
expeditioners and tourists to be vectors of disease as they move around
Antarctica may pose the greatest threat yet to its avian fauna.
The Antarctic Division is taking this to the Antarctic Treaty Nations
Meeting in Christchurch New Zealand for discussion. We want raise the
awareness of the increasing risk of disease to fauna in Antarctica and to
encourage Treaty Nations to strengthen the current protocols for protection
of fauna. Australia is also planning to hold a workshop to address this
issue within the next year.
