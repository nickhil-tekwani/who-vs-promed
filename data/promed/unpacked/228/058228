The HPA [Health Protection Agency] has called on parents to vaccinate
their children. The number of measles cases has almost tripled in
what was already the largest outbreak in the northeast of England for
almost 20 years. HPA officials said 99 cases had been reported so far
this year [2009], and more than 100 suspected cases were being
investigated. The number of confirmed cases reported when figures
were last released in May 2009 was 37. The agency said there were
only 17 cases reported in 2008.

It is urging parents to ensure children have had 2 doses of the
measles mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. More than 25 000 leaflets
and posters have been sent to community buildings in the North
Tyneside Primary Care Trust (PCT) area advising parents on the
vaccine. Dr Meng Khaw, director of public health for the PCT, said:
"This measles outbreak is very alarming, especially as the majority
of these cases could have been prevented, as most were in children
who were not fully protected with MMR. There is no treatment for
measles, but it can be prevented by the safe and highly effective MMR vaccine."
