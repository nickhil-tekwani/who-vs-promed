Mutation determining the high pathogenicity of HPAI H7N3 virus identified
-----------------------------------------------
Scientists have discovered that a slight genetic variation caused a
strain of avian influenza A virus to be devastating to Fraser Valley
poultry. [The virus remained] benign to humans. Investigators
realized that it was a rare, and highly virulent, strain of avian
influenza A (H7N3) virus, [a serotype of avian influenza virus
usually considered to be a low-pathogenicity form of avian influenza
A virus], soon after the virus began killing chickens on farms just
north of the border town of Sumas, WA in Mar 2004. They have
concluded, [also], that the [Fraser valley strain of avian influenza]
virus has never [interacted with genetic material of human influenza
A virus], easing a long-standing fear that avian and human influenza
viruses could somehow [interact to produce a virus that could spread
rapidly through the human population]. "The one thing that we're
really, really afraid of, and we've been running scared of, is the
possibility of a reassortant virus," said Martin Petric, a virologist
at the British Columbia Center for Disease Control. Officials were
especially concerned after 2 farm workers contracted pink-eye
[conjunctivitis], a mild symptom of virus infection. [Conjunctivitis
is an infrequent consequence of exposure to several different
respiratory viruses and is not specific for influenza virus
infection. - Mod.CP] "What we have been able to show is that the
[Fraser Valley outbreak influenza A (H7N3) virus is entirely an avian
influenza virus]," Petric said on Tue 4 May 2004.
The H7N3 virus is different from the H5 strain that has killed
several people in Asia as well as hundreds of thousands of chickens.
All 19 million chickens, turkeys, and other poultry in the Fraser
Valley, east of Vancouver, are being culled in an effort to wipe out
the H7N3 virus, which is believed to have infected 40 commercial
farms and 10 smaller backyard flocks. About 200 farms have tested
negative. Concerned about the possibility that the outbreak might
jump the border, about 40 U.S. federal agricultural officials went to
Whatcom County, WA last week to check on "backyard poultry" --
chickens, turkeys, pheasants, ducks, and geese -- and their owners.
So far, no cases of [avian influenza virus infection] have been
reported in Washington state.
Avian influenza A (H7N3) virus is normally not a quick killer, but
mutation, [as opposed to reassortment of genome sub-units], has
rendered the Fraser Valley strain highly pathogenic. Scientists
discovered an [insertion of amino acids in a region of a viral
protein that determines pathogenicity]. These amino acids are absent
from [the analogous protein] of an avirulent strain of avian
influenza A (H7N3) virus found in the same area. "It is suggestive,
but not proof, that [this insertion] is associated with the increased
pathogenicity," said Dr. Caroline Astell, project leader at the
British Columbia Cancer Agency's Genome Sciences Center.

[Identification of mutational change in a single gene of a Fraser
Valley isolate of avian influenza A (H7N3) virus is a significant
result, implying that the British Columbia group has obtained the
complete sequence of the genome of this virus. The information may
assist in the design of diagnostic reagents for earlier detection of
highly pathogenic strains of avian influenza. It is reassuring that
there is no evidence of reassortment of genes between this avian
influenza virus and any human influenza virus. Despite the foreboding
of many virologists, in none of the recent major outbreaks of avian
influenza -- H5N1 in East Asia, H7N7 in the Netherlands, and, now,
H7N3 in Canada -- has there been evidence of genetic interaction
between avian and human influenza viruses that might potentially
precede the evolution of a novel human pandemic strain of influenza A
virus. - Mod.CP]
