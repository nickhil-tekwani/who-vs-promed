Health officials in New Brunswick say they have some leads in their search for the source of an _E. coli_ outbreak that they believe has left people ill in 3 communities. However, a spokeswoman for the Health Department said there is, "still no clear evidence of the source of the outbreak." Jennifer Graham says in an e-mail that 27 cases of bloody diarrhea suspected to be caused by _E. coli_ have been reported since Tue 1 May 2012.

The 1st person began showing symptoms on 23 Apr 2012 and as of Friday night, 4 May 2012, 23 cases were reported in Miramichi, 2 in Saint John and 2 in Bathurst.

So far, 11 cases have tested positive as _E. coli_ O157, a severe strain that can cause serious illness and sometimes lead to kidney failure.

Ms. Graham says officials are unsure if the Saint John cases are linked to the Miramichi cases, or if they are from a different source. She said 14 people have been hospitalized, 8 of whom remain in hospital. New Brunswick gets an average of 12 cases of this infection per year.
