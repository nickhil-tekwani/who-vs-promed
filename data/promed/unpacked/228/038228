China posted a steep jump in daily COVID-19 infections on Tuesday [15 Mar 2022], with new cases more than doubling from a day earlier to a 2-year high as a virus outbreak expanded rapidly in the country's northeast.

A total of 3507 domestically transmitted cases with confirmed symptoms were reported on Monday [14 Mar 2022] across more than a dozen provinces and municipalities, the National Health Commission said, up from 1337 a day earlier.

China's caseload is still tiny by global standards, but health experts said the rate of increase in daily cases over the next few weeks will be a crucial factor in determining whether its tough "dynamic clearance" approach -- which aims to contain each outbreak -- is still effective against the rapidly spreading omicron variant.

A COVID-19 forecasting system run by Lanzhou University in China's northwest predicted that the current round of infections would eventually be brought under control in early April [2022] after an accumulated total of around 35 000 cases.

The university said in its latest assessment published on Monday [14 Mar 2022] that while the current outbreak was the most serious on the mainland since Wuhan in 2020, China could bring it under control as long as stringent curbs remained in place.

In the financial hub of Shanghai, authorities battling an outbreak across the city were cordoning off individual apartment buildings and testing all residents.

China's aviation regulator said that 106 international flights scheduled to arrive in Shanghai will be diverted to other domestic cities from 21 Mar-1 May [2022] due to COVID.

Confirmed symptomatic infections in Shanghai stood at 21 on Monday [14 Mar 2022], including 12 imported from overseas, with an additional 130 asymptomatic cases.

Nearly 90% of the mainland's confirmed new symptomatic cases on Monday [14 Mar 2022] were found in the northeastern province of Jilin, which has banned its 24.1 million population from traveling in and out of the province and across different areas within the province without notifying local police.

Jilin officials should step up the preparation of temporary hospitals and designated hospitals and make use of idle venues to ensure all infections and their close contacts are isolated, a local Communist Party authority-backed paper said, citing the provincial head of the party.

The number of new asymptomatic cases, which China does not classify as confirmed cases, stood at 1768 compared with 906 a day earlier.

There were no new deaths, leaving the death toll unchanged at 4636.

As of 14 Mar [2022], mainland China had reported 120 504 cases with confirmed symptoms, including both local ones and those arriving from outside the mainland.

[B] Lockdowns

Several of China's largest factory cities have suspended production because of a lockdown. Theaters, cinemas, and many restaurants have closed in Shanghai. The northeastern province of Jilin on Monday [14 Mar 2022] banned its 24 million residents from leaving the province or traveling between cities.

China is grappling with its largest surge of known coronavirus infections since the coronavirus first emerged more than 2 years ago in central China. Sustained outbreaks in 2/3 of the country's provinces are proving the toughest test yet of China's zero-tolerance coronavirus policy.

Even as countries in the West are now loosening or abandoning mask mandates and other measures, Chinese officials are implementing some of their most stringent methods. That is in large part because China can't afford to lift restrictions.

The government has been concerned about comparatively lower rates of vaccination among China's older adults. The country also has far fewer intensive care hospital beds compared to its population than most industrialized countries. In China's vast rural areas, hospitals and medical facilities are often basic, and a major outbreak could quickly overwhelm hospitals.

The United States and other Western countries have suffered far higher rates of infection and deaths over the past 2 years than China, and still have higher rates now. But the 7-day average rate of new cases in mainland China, now at 1584, has more than quintupled in recent days.

[2] Global roundup

Until recently, American Samoa, an archipelago in the South Pacific Ocean, was one of the world's last holdouts from the coronavirus. But in recent weeks, infections have spread quickly. Weekly cases jumped from around 2 dozen in mid-February [2022] to more than 100 by the end of the month [February 2022], according to the World Health Organization.

The government swiftly imposed a set of lockdown restrictions known as "Code Red" on 22 Feb [2022], barring travel into the territory, banning all public gatherings, and closing all but essential businesses.

Cases are still relatively low: the US territory reported 443 confirmed cases between early January and mid-March 2022]. With about 80% of the population vaccinated, the territory has not reported a single COVID fatality.

Having restricted most inbound flights at the onset of the pandemic, American Samoa did not report its 1st COVID case until last September [2022], 18 months after the virus started spreading across the world. Since then, it contained cases with social distancing measures and quarantines for travelers.

In France, the government on Monday [`4 Mar 2022] dropped most virus restrictions, including the requirement to show proof of vaccination to enter venues. It also said people no longer are required to wear masks in indoor public spaces, except on public transport and in hospitals. The decision came weeks before the 1st round of France's presidential election, in which President Emmanuel Macron is seeking to secure a 2nd term. Cases are on the rise, with nearly 60 000 new daily cases reported on Thursday [10 Mar 2022], a 16% increase from the previous week, according to health authorities.

Hong Kong is struggling to get a handle on its worst coronavirus outbreak since the start of the pandemic, warning that it doesn't have the testing capacity to carry out the strict strategy handed down by Beijing.

In Shenzhen and Shanghai, in mainland China, officials imposed restrictions on millions of people within days of local outbreaks in order to test every single resident. But Hong Kong's chief executive, Carrie Lam, noted on Monday [14 Mar 2022] that her city doesn't have the same ability.

"Hong Kong is very different from many mainland cities, and therefore we cannot have any comparison," Mrs. Lam told reporters at a news conference.

The difference amounts to resources and systems of governance, Mrs. Lam said. Shenzhen and Shanghai can test millions of people a day; Hong Kong's health officials can only test between 200 000 and 300 000 people a day.

Hong Kong, one of the last places in the world that is still trying to get rid of the virus instead of living with it, has reported more than 700 000 cases and 4066 deaths since late January [2022]. Over the past week, Hong Kong is averaging more than 280 deaths and 21 000 new cases per day, according to the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University.

It is a strategy that has been dictated by Beijing but one that appears increasingly out of reach for Hong Kong, which continues to hold freedoms that don't exist in the mainland.

[3] Pfizer vaccine: 4th dose
Date: Mon 14 Mar 2022
Source: CBS News [edited]
https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-vaccine-fourth-dose-booster-pfizer-ceo-albert-bourla/


Pfizer's CEO says the company is submitting data to the Food and Drug Administration on the need for a 4th dose of its COVID-19 vaccine. While the shot Pfizer is currently producing with BioNTech still protects against severe disease, the drugmaker now believes another booster is needed to ward off infections.

"Right now, the way that we have seen, it is necessary, a 4th booster right now. The protection that you are getting from the 3rd, it is good enough, actually quite good for hospitalizations and deaths. It's not that good against infections," Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla told "Face the Nation" in an interview that aired Sunday [13 Mar 2022].

Steven Danehy, a spokesperson for Pfizer, said Bourla was referring to "early and preliminary" data and pointed to a study announced in January [2022] examining both a 4th dose of the currently authorized formulation as well as one designed to target the omicron variant.

"We will continue to collect and assess all available data and remain in open dialogue with regulators and health authorities to help inform a COVID-19 vaccine strategy as the virus evolves," Danehy said in a statement.

A White House spokesperson referred inquiries about the submission to the FDA. A spokesperson for the agency declined to comment.

Bourla had previously described the company's submission as a "significant package of data about the need for a 4th dose," in an interview with CNBC. His conclusions echo trends observed by health authorities around the world, who have studied vaccine effectiveness during the omicron variant wave earlier this year [2022].

A cohort study published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last month [February 2022] found vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 emergency room or urgent care visits had decreased to 66% among those who had received a 3rd dose of one of the mRNA vaccines 4-5 months ago. The vaccine was 78% effective against COVID-19 hospitalizations among this group.

Beyond the 4th shot, Bourla said the company is attempting to create a new vaccine "that will protect against all variants, including omicron, but also something that can protect for at least a year."

"Omicron was the 1st one that was able to evade in a skillful way, the immune protection that we're giving. But also, we know that the duration of the protection doesn't last very long," he said.

Federal health officials have previously said an additional booster shot would likely be needed to head off new waves of the virus, though potentially not until the fall for most people.

"The hope would be that after our 3rd shots we're able to get enough time out of them that we end up on essentially a yearly COVID-19 booster," Dr. Peter Marks, the FDA's top vaccines official, told an event hosted by the University of California San Francisco and Stanford University in January 2022].

That timeline had been echoed by executives at Moderna, which is also racing to trial new versions of their COVID-19 vaccine it hopes regulators can greenlight ahead of a potential "fall booster season."

"It is time to update the vaccine against the mutations that are currently circulating, and to improve the durability against those new variants of concern. But it does run into the challenge of those filings," Moderna's president Stephen Hoge told investors last month [February 2022].

However, officials have said the 4th dose timeline could be accelerated for groups more vulnerable to severe breakthrough infections as the virus continues to spread.

"I don't think you're going to be hearing, if you do, any kind of recommendations that would be across the board for everyone," Dr. Anthony Fauci, the president's chief medical adviser, told reporters last month [February 2022].

Close to 1/2 of all vaccinated adults and more than 2/3 of vaccinated American seniors have received a booster shot, according to the CDC's figures.

While the pace of new cases and hospitalizations is continuing to slow nationwide in the wake of the omicron surge earlier this year [2022], more than 1000 COVID-19 deaths are still being reported per day on average.

In Europe -- which had also seen infections plummet following an omicron surge -- the pace of new cases is once again climbing after several nations moved to lift their pandemic restrictions.

"It very likely will take into account what subset of people have a diminished, or not, protection against the important parameters such as hospitalization," said Fauci.

[Also read "Who might benefit from a 4th shot - and who might not" by Michaeleen Doucleff, NPR Goats and Soda, 22 Feb 2022, at https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2022/02/22/1029057935/who-might-benefit-from-a-4th-shot-and-who-might-not.

"So the question is: Should you get a 4th dose to beef up protection again?

"A preliminary study from Israel, published [15 Feb 2022], suggests that for the general population, the answer is likely no. A 4th shot of the same vaccine -- in this case Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna -- offered very little extra protection against infection compared with only 3 shots.

"'Not a 3rd dose, not a 4th dose, not a 5th dose will do anything to stop infections [long term],' says Dr. Gili Regev-Yochay, an infectious disease specialist at Sheba Medical Center in Tel HaShomer, Israel, and lead author of the new study.

"But that's not to say that an additional dose is pointless in all circumstances. For older people or those at high risk, an extra dose may be needed to help maintain protection against severe disease, Regev-Yochay says. 'A 4th dose probably does have a role in protecting against severe disease.'"

"So an extra booster will likely help extend protection against severe disease for people over 65, people with health factors that increase their risk, or people with compromised immune systems.

"'These people will likely be the 1st group to require another booster,' says Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University. 'Their immune response is not as robust as a healthy young person.'

"But, she says, scientists don't know yet when these people will need that extra shot. 'It depends on how fast the immunity is waning. So we'll have to wait and see.'

"Waiting is exactly what the Food and Drug Administration has decided to do before it recommends an extra booster shot to anyone. 'We simply don't have enough data to know that it's a good thing to do,' Dr. Peter Marks of the FDA told The New York Times on [17 Feb 2022].

"But several countries are already moving forward with a 4th dose. On Tuesday [22 Feb 2022], Sweden began to offer an extra jab to people over age 80 and those living in nursing homes. Chile now offers a 4th dose to anyone over age 55 who had their 3rd dose more than 5 months ago. And Israel has authorized 4th shots to adults over age 60 and any adult with underlying health conditions.

"'So getting a 4th dose is probably important only for those vulnerable populations who need this extra protection,' says Regev-Yochay, of Sheba Medical Center. 'In general, I would recommend they receive any protection they can.'" - Mod.LK]

- The Americas region reported 3.0% of cases and 13.4% of deaths in the past 24 hours having reported more than 149.06 million cases, 2nd to the European region, as the most severely affected region. Brazil reported 18 642 cases followed by Chile. An additional 4 countries reported more than 1000 cases (Argentina, Mexico, Canada, and Uruguay) in the past 24 hours. Additionally, Cuba and Peru reported more than 500 but fewer than 1000 cases. The USA, Bolivia, and Cost Rica, among others, did not report any cases in the last 24 hours.
- The European region reported 40.1% of cases and 54.1% of deaths over the last 24 hours, as the most affected region, with cumulative cases exceeding 189.03 million. Some countries reporting few or no cases in the last 24 hours or longer include Portugal, Hungary, and Norway, among others. A total of 28 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours, with 1 country reporting more than 100 000 cases, 11 reporting more than 10 000, and 16 reporting over 1000 cases, while 1 country reported more than 500 but fewer than 1000 cases.
- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 0.62% of daily case numbers and 3.9% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 21.45 million cases. Iran (3813) reported the highest number of cases over the last 24 hours followed by Bahrain. Iraq and Lebanon reported more than 500 but less than 1000 cases over the last 24 hours. Jordan, Egypt, and Sudan, among others, did not report any cases over the last 24 hours.
- The African region reported 0.73% of daily cases and 0.37% of total deaths during the past 24 hours having reported a cumulative total of more than 8.49 million cases. Reunion (8514) reported the highest number of cases over the last 24 hours followed by South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Central African Republic. Most of remaining countries reported below 100 or 50 cases. A total of 20 countries did not report any cases over the last 24 hours. The low reported numbers may not be a true reflection of the prevalent COVID19 situation in the region, as vaccine coverage remains low.
- The Western Pacific region reported 53.9% of daily case numbers and 23.8% of deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 33.88 million cases. South Korea (362 338) reported the highest number of cases over the last 24 hours followed by Viet Nam, Japan, Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand, China, Singapore, Brunei, and Philippines.
- The South East Asia region reported 1.6% of the daily newly reported cases and 4.4% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 56.52 million cases. Thailand (19 742) reported the highest number of cases followed by India (2568). The rest of the countries did not report any cases over the last 24 hours.
