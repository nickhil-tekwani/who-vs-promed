Around 1000 cattle have died of toxic jaundice in Majuli over the past few days [Majuli is a large river island in the Brahmaputra River in the state of Assam, India. - CopyEd.MSP]. State veterinary officials have found the carcasses of 140 cattle in different sandbars of the river island up to Thursday [4 Aug 2016] evening, and another 600 are suspected to have been infected.

A 4-member team of scientists from North Eastern Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, Guwahati, visited the island on Thursday [4 Aug 2016]. Another team from the College of Veterinary Science, Khanapara also visited the affected areas of the island.

Both teams confirmed that the cattle in the sandbars were suffering from toxic jaundice caused by the consumption of _Lantana camara_, a poisonous shrub found in the area. Cattle usually do not consume this shrub but have been doing so in Majuli due to severe shortage of fodder during the floods.

Locals said the shrub would not be found on Majuli earlier but made an appearance after the massive floods of 1988.

Majuli sub-divisional veterinary officer (in charge) Thaneswar Mudoi said: "We have identified the disease today [Thu 4 Aug 2016]." He added, "Cattle across sandbars of the island have been infected by the disease, and the number of deaths has been increasing rapidly."

The affected sandbars are Tikirai, Major, Moloya, Ahotguri Gaon Panchyat, Dakhin Ahatguri Gaon Panchyat, Korotipar, Misamora, Kerker, Gopal Chook, Sokoli, Basikota, Siriguri, Tekeli , Modar Guri, Dhekeli, and Baghedhora. Locals alleged that the island lacked enough veterinary staff and medicines. Jagat Hazarika, a social worker, said, "Only 4 veterinary doctors and 36 helpers are here to tackle this outbreak."

[Species affected by lantana poisoning include cattle, sheep, goats, guinea pigs and rabbits. Further research is needed to determine the long term effects of lantana on goats and camels. Children can also be poisoned by eating berries, but symptoms differ to those of livestock.

Animals in pastures with sufficient forage will often avoid Lantana, perhaps because of its pungent aroma and taste, but animals unfamiliar to the plant may ingest enough to affect them. 50 to 90 percent of animals newly exposed may be affected. Foliage and ripe berries contain the toxic substances with the toxins being in higher concentrations in the green berries. Species affected include cattle, sheep, horses, dogs, guinea pigs, and rabbits (Ross, Ivan A. Medicial plants of the world. Totowa, N.J.: Humana. 1999. p. 187.)

Lantana contains lantadene A and B (the major toxins involved in poisoning) as well as other structurally and toxicologically related pentacyclic triterpene acids, including reduced lantadene A, dihydrolantadene A, and icterogenin.

Significant lantana toxins are the triterpene acids, lantadene A (rehmannic acid), lantadene B, and their reduced forms. A toxic dose for a 500 kg cow varies from about 5 to 20 kg of fresh leaf (one per cent or more of an animal's body weight), depending on the toxin content of the lantana eaten.

The major clinical effect of Lantana toxicosis is photosensitization, the onset of which often takes place in 1 to 2 days after consumption of a toxic dose (1 percent or more of animal's body weight). Jaundice is usually prominent, animals usually become inappetent, and they often exhibit decreased digestive tract motility and constipation. Other signs may include: sluggishness, weakness, and transient, sometimes bloody diarrhea. In acute cases, death occurs in 2 to 4 days. Subacute poisoning is more common and may result in death after 1 to 3 weeks of illness and weight loss. Raw photosensitized surface areas are susceptible to invasions by blowfly maggots and bacteria. In severely affected cattle, lesions may appear at the muzzle, mouth, and nostrils. Ulceration may be present in the cheeks, tongue, and gums, while swelling, hardening, peeling of mucous membranes, and deeper tissues occur in the nostrils.

Signs of lantana poisoning depend on the amount and type of lantana consumed and the intensity of sunlight to which the animals have been exposed. Signs can appear after one feed and, in acute cases, within 24 hours. Poisoned animals may show signs of:

- excessive skin sensitivity to sunlight (photosensitisation)
- liver damage
- yellow discoloration (jaundice) of the whites of the eyes and gums, and skin of the nose and mouth
The animal may also:
- avoid sunlight (photophobia)
- stop eating
- appear sluggish, weak and depressed
- urinate frequently
- become constipated (most commonly) or have diarrhea with strong-smelling black fluid feces in severely affected animals
- become dehydrated.

Animals killed by lantana poisoning display the following post-mortem signs:

- yellow discolouration of tissues (jaundice)
- hard, dry, mucus-covered faecal masses in large intestine
- dry, undigested plant material in the rumen
- swollen and discolored (yellow to orange) liver
- swollen gall bladder
- swollen and pale kidneys that turn green when exposed to air and cutting
- ulcerated cheeks, muzzle, nostrils, tongue and gums (in severe cases in cattle).

If animals lose their appetite, stop drinking, show signs of jaundice and/or develop reddening of the muzzle, they should be moved to lantana-free areas and kept in the shade. Unless treated quickly, severely affected cattle almost invariably die within 10 days of eating the plant. Even if an animal's lesions (caused by sun sensitivity) begin to heal and their liver function seems to return to normal, many cattle will still die up to 6 weeks after being poisoned.

Effective treatment may include:
- giving intravenous fluids and encouraging the animal to eat
- treating skin damage with antibiotics and sunscreens; other drugs can provide relief but are available only on veterinary prescription
- drenching with a slurry (2.5 kg activated charcoal in 20 liters of electrolyte replacement solution for cattle; 500 g in 4 liters for sheep and goats).

Activated charcoal is an effective but expensive poisoning antidote. A 2nd dose may be required 24 hours after the 1st if the animal has not improved. Bentonite can be substituted for activated charcoal; it is not as effective, taking up to 2 days longer to produce the same result; however, being cheaper, it enables a more economic treatment of large numbers of animals. Use the same dose as for charcoal in a slurry with water. The outlook for recovery is good, provided animals are treated quickly. Delay reduces the effectiveness of treatment, because kidney function may be seriously damaged.
