Considerable increase in leishmaniasis in Suriname
--------------------------------------------------
Recent research in Suriname shows a considerable increase in the
numbers of cases of the parasitic skin disease leishmaniasis, in
Suriname better known as 'Bosjaws' or 'Busi-yasi.'

Within the integrated research programme 'Leishmaniasis in Suriname,'
coordinated by the department Biomedical Research of the Royal
Tropical Institute (KIT) and funded by NOW-WOTRO, Surinam and Dutch
researchers are studying the biology, diagnosis and treatment of the
disease. Furthermore, health care seeking behaviour of patients is
being studied.

Accurate diagnosis
------------------
At a recent consortium meeting, which was also attended by the
Minister of Health of Surinam and other local stakeholders, it was
announced that the number of registered leishmaniasis cases in 2010
was doubled compared to previous years.

And possibly even more cases are present in the hinterland of Surinam
that is not well accessible. This increase emphasizes the need for
good diagnosis of the disease, as it may be confused with other skin
diseases. The media in Surinam have called for more attention for
leishmaniasis. This also applies for Dutch general practitioners who
may be confronted more and more with the disease through patients who
have contracted slow healing ulcers during their visit to the interior
in Surinam.

Treatment and prevention
------------------------
Researcher Henk Schallig from KIT Biomedical Research emphasized that
appropriate treatment of leishmaniasis is needed to prevent further
spread of the disease, and that less painful therapies should be
sought. At the moment, leishmaniasis is treated in Suriname by giving
3 injections 3 times around the ulcers. Particularly for children this
treatment is very painful. In addition, the consortium demonstrated
that possibly not all patients responded well to treatment. The reason
for this is currently being investigated.

[A study 5 years ago states "Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a
widespread disease in Suriname caused by Leishmania Viannia
guyanensis. It is argued that other Leishmania species are also
responsible for CL and that the incidence is increasing" and "With
extrapolation of collected data, a detection rate was calculated of
5.32 to 6.13 CL patients per 1000 inhabitants for the hinterland and
0.64 to 0.74 patients per 1000 inhabitants for the whole country."
(van der Meide WF et al. Epidemiology of cutaneous leishmaniasis in
Suriname: a study performed in 2006. Am J Trop Med Hyg.
2008;79:192-7). It should be noted that an increased interest in CL in
Suriname may increase the number of registered cases.
