Fish Kill Investigated - (STATEWIDE) -- Thousands of adult white bass have
been killed in one Minnesota lake in the past several weeks. _Trichodina_, a
microscopic parasite that occurs naturally, is to blame. No other species
of fish were affected. The bacteria are not harmful to humans.

--
[Can anyone tell us what _Trichodina_ is, and how long this
outbreak has been going on?
I have been on the telephone for over an hour to the Minnesota
Health Department, Minn. wildlife, Minn. fisheries, Minn. ecology,
Minn. Forest and Lakes division, Div, of Natural Resources,
Fisheries Laboratory, DNR water quality and wildlife, and I have
lost track of how many others. No one seems to know anything
about a fish kill, no one has seen the news service or a wire
release, and I have left messages on voice mail (which says
people will not be back until tomorrow) at DNR Hunting and Fishing
and Water Quality division. But I am not hopeful - Mod.TG]
