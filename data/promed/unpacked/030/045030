One person has died in Buncombe County from an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease, as health officials investigate the disease's possible link to the Mountain State Fair.

The NC Department of Health and Human Services is working with health departments in Buncombe and Henderson counties to investigate several reported cases of Legionnaires' disease among attendees of the NC [North Carolina] Mountain State Fair earlier this month [September 2019].

Kim Horton, spokeswoman for the Henderson County Department of Public Health, confirmed one death from the airborne disease. "We don't yet know whether people might have been exposed to _Legionella_ bacteria at the NC Mountain State Fair," Dr. Zack Moore, the state epidemiologist, stated in a 24 Sep [2019] press release. "As a precaution, we are recommending that anyone who went to the fair and has symptoms of pneumonia, like cough, fever, or shortness of breath, see a doctor right away and talk with them about Legionnaires' disease."

The Mountain State Fair ran from 6-15 Sep [2019] at the WNC Agricultural Center in Fletcher. More than 170 000 attended the 10-day event, according to fair officials. "Features, exhibits, and rides that incorporated some type of water exposure that created droplets that came in contact with visitors will be our focus," Henderson County director of health Steven Smith wrote in an email on [Tue 24 Sep 2019] to the Henderson County Board of Health.

With the fair over, Smith is optimistic further Legionnaires' threats can be controlled. "Limiting any future exposures for individuals is an important objective right now," he wrote.

Legionnaires' disease spreads by the inhalation of water droplets in the air that contain a bacterium called _Legionella_, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Harmful droplets can originate from manmade water sources like tanks, air conditioners, and fountains.

Potential symptoms include cough, fever, and diarrhea. Symptoms do not always manifest in someone exposed to the bacteria. Individuals over 50 are at the greatest risk of experiencing symptoms, according to the CDC. The disease is not contagious from person to person.

The North Carolina Department of Health says the number of confirmed cases of legionellosis has now grown to 25. The NCDPH was 1st notified about an increase in the number of Legionnaire's disease cases in Buncombe and Henderson counties on Mon 23 Sept 2019.

As of 26 Sep [2019], Buncombe County has had 15 confirmed cases, Haywood County has had 2 confirmed cases, Henderson County has had 6 confirmed cases, and Transylvania County has had 2 confirmed cases. Of those confirmed cases, 22 people have required hospitalization, and one person has died.

The source of the outbreak is under investigation. Many of the cases reported attending the NC Mountain State Fair, held 6-15 Sep 2019 in Fletcher.

As a precaution, anyone who attended the NC Mountain State Fair and is experiencing cough, fever, or shortness of breath is advised to call their healthcare provider right away and talk to them about Legionnaire's disease.

[There are now 25 confirmed cases of Legionnaires' disease in 4 adjacent western North Carolina counties: Buncombe County, 15 cases; Haywood County, 2 cases; Henderson County, 6 cases; and Transylvania County, 2 cases. One person has died. "Many" of the cases reported attending the Mountain State Fair, a 10-day agricultural fair held 6-15 Sep 2019 in Fletcher, a town in Henderson County (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fletcher,_North_Carolina). The fair draws about 190 000 people each year (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_Mountain_State_Fair). A map showing the location of these counties can be found at https://geology.com/county-map/north-carolina.shtml.

Inhalation of aerosolized _Legionella_ is a common way for acquiring Legionnaires' disease, and aerosols containing _Legionella_ can be generated from contaminated water by cooling towers, hot tubs, fountains, showerheads, and misting sprays in outdoor event spaces and in grocery departments. Aerosol-generating water features at the fair are the suspected source. However, in people who are prone to aspirate, contaminated drinking water may be another possible mode of transmission.

Genotyping of clinical and environmental isolates should be done. Cases with matching _Legionella_ genotypes will establish a cluster with a common source, and matching clinical and environmental isolates will establish a source responsible for the particular cluster.

At present, all 25 Legionnaires' disease cases reside in counties that surround the location of the fair. However, we are not told how many fair attendees reside in more distant locations. These people may have developed Legionnaires' disease after returning home, the fair not being suspected as the source. According to the US CDC, about 20-25% of all cases of Legionnaires' disease reported to the CDC is travel associated (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5648a2.htm and http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2016/conveyance-transportation-issues/cruise-ship-travel).

Travelers typically disperse to their homes, widely separated from one another and perhaps at a very great distance from the source of infection, before developing symptoms, so that a cluster of cases of Legionnaires' disease in travelers associated with the same source may not be readily appreciated. A travel history is essential and should be actively sought from patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and _Legionella_ testing should be performed for those diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia who have traveled in the 2 weeks before onset of symptoms. - Mod.ML
