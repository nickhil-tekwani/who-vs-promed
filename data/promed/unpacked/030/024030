re: Avian Influenza (44) Â­ Viet Nam, Civet 20080312.0991
--------------------------------------------------------
The posting regarding avian influenza in Owston's civets (_Chrotogale
owstoni_) refers to an event which occurred in our centre, the Carnivore
and Pangolin Conservation Program (CPCP) of Cuc Phuong National Park, Viet Nam.

The CPCP runs a rescue and rehabilitation centre for carnivores and
pangolins confiscated from the illegal wildlife trade in Viet Nam, as well
as a successful conservation breeding program for the Owston's civet. The
CPCP Captive Management Team is committed to ensuring the health and
welfare of animals in the centre. Animal health is constantly monitored,
and any problems are quickly investigated. It is because of this that a
diagnosis was quickly achieved, and measures were put in place to protect
the health of staff and remaining animals in the centre. Currently all
staff and animals are healthy, with no signs of disease.

This posting aims to clear up some misunderstandings in the recent coverage
of this outbreak.

Species and number of individuals involved
------------------------------------------
During February 2008, a number of wild birds, and both wild and captive
animals, died in the national park. There are many possible reasons for
this, including the very severe cold spell which was just coming to an end.

1. Captive mammals cared for by the CPCP
- Owston's civet (_Chrotogale owstoni_): During February 2008, 4 captive
Owston's civets died. These animals tested POSITIVE for AI H5N1. On 2 Mar
2008 a further Owston's civet died, however this animal tested NEGATIVE for
AI H5N1.

- common palm civet (_Paradoxurus hermaphroditus_): During February 2008, 2
captive common palm civets died. These animals had been recently
confiscated from the wildlife trade. Both were in quarantine within the
CPCP. Both animals died secondary to severe wounds associated with hunting
(one snare trap wound, one dog bite wound penetrating the thoracic cavity).
These animals both tested NEGATIVE for AI H5N1.

2. Other animals
A number of other animals (including 3 captive primates, 2 wild civets, and
6 wild black-crested bulbuls) also died in February. Samples from these
animals were sent to the NVDC Laboratory, Department of Animal Health for
testing. While we believe that all animal samples have tested NEGATIVE for
H5N1, subscribers should refer to the Department of Animal Health, Hanoi,
for more details on these animals.

Tests conducted
---------------
Detailed medical records were kept throughout the outbreak and thorough
post mortem examinations were conducted. Frozen necropsy tissues were
tested at the National Veterinary Diagnostics Centre (NVDC) of the
Department of Animal Health in Hanoi. Diagnosis was confirmed using both
PCR and viral culture. For more details concerning tests, subscribers are
directed to the NVDC, Hanoi.

Diet fed to civets in the CPCP
------------------------------
The CPCP has never fed poultry meat to animals inside the centre. Since the
2005 outbreak of H5N1 in the centre, no duck eggs, chicken eggs, or pork
has been fed to the animals.

Prior to the recent disease outbreak, civets were fed a mixture of locally
available fruits (banana, apple, pear, grape), raw beef, freshwater shrimp,
earthworms, grasshoppers, crabs, fish and frogs. Since 15 Feb 2008, the
diet has consisted of fruit (banana, grapes, apple, pear), beef, shrimp,
fish, and a commercially prepared cat food. As a further safety measure,
beef is now cooked prior to feeding.

Biosecurity in the CPCP
-----------------------
Since 2005, the CPCP has had a strict biosecurity protocol. This protocol
aims to safeguard the health of staff, and reduce the risk of introducing
disease or spreading disease between animals in the centre.

VIRKON (DuPont) footbaths, at the correct concentration required to kill AI
H5N1 virus, are used at the front gate of the centre, at the entrance to
the quarantine facility, and at the entrance gates to each of the
individual enclosure blocks. Staff are encouraged to wash their hands with
soap and water on arrival, both before and after contact with animals or
their enclosures, and before leaving at the end of the day.

Since this outbreak began, staff are required to wear personal protective
equipment (including N95 face mask, goggles, rubber boots, gloves and
waterproof coat) when they have direct contact with an animal or when
entering any animal enclosure.

Ongoing investigations
----------------------
The CPCP is currently cooperating with the management of Cuc Phuong
National Park and the NVDC, Department of Animal Health staff to conduct a
thorough and ongoing investigation into the epidemiology of this disease
outbreak. A range of Environmental samples have been collected and tested
by the NVDC laboratory. All remaining animals in the centre have received a
thorough physical examination under general anaesthesia. Oropharyngeal
swabs from these animals are currently being tested for active virus, and
serum is being tested for antibodies to AI H5N1, by the NVDC laboratory in
Hanoi.

For any further information, please feel free to contact CPCP Program
Manager, Tran Quang Phuong (<carnivore@vnn.vn>) or veterinarian Leanne
Clark (<scpvet@gmail.com>).

[We are most grateful to Dr Clark for this firsthand, authoritative,
detailed report, including useful background, which address the queries and
requests for information included in our previous postings on the mortality
of Owston's civets (4 positive, 1 negative) and common palm civets (2
negative) in the Cuc Phuong National Park. As to the (apparently negative)
3 captive primates (reportedly, 2 langurs and one loris), official
information from the Department of Animal Health, Hanoi (either to us or,
duly, to the OIE) is anticipated. - Mod.AS]
