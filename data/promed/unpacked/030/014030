One new human H7N9 avian influenza case has been confirmed in east China's Zhejiang Province, local authorities said Tuesday [15 Oct 2013]. It was the 2nd such case reported in Zhejiang since late April [2013], according to a statement from the provincial health department.

A 35-year-old man tested positive for the H7N9 virus at the Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, according to the statement. The man, a company employee from Shaoxing County, was admitted to a township hospital on 8 Oct 2013. He is in critical condition and is receiving treatment at a Shaoxing county hospital.

H7N9 bird flu cases in China reached 134 by the end of August [2013]. Of the [now 135] cases, 45 patients have died, according to the National Health and Family Planning Commission.

No new cases of H7N9 infection were reported on the Chinese mainland in September [2013], according to the commission.

[This is an alarming report. This new case may either be the tail-end of the preceding outbreak of avian H7N9 virus infection, or the harbinger of a new outbreak. Termination of the initial H7N9 avian influenza outbreak has been attributed either to reduced exposure following the closure of live poultry markets throughout China, or alternatively to the same seasonal factors determining the annual variation in non-avian influenza. Further information is awaited, particularly with respect to the patient's exposure to live poultry. - Mod.CP
