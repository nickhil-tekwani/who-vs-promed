re ProMED Undiagnosed deaths, goat - Morocco: (SS) RFI 20210303.8225738
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
A high-mortality event in goats should include evaluation for contagious caprine pleuropneumonia (CCPP) due to _Mycoplasma capricolum_ subsp. _capripneumoniae_. Seroprevalence studies indicate CCPP presence in West Africa (though no sites in Morocco were evaluated). Given the OIE regulation of CCPP it is an important rule out.

[CCPP is a severe disease of goats occurring in many countries in Africa and Asia; synonyms include pleuropneumonie contagieuse caprine (France), bou-frida (Algeria), and abu-nini (Sudan).

Peracute, acute and chronic forms occur in endemic areas. In case of the peracute presentation, the affected goats may die within 1-3 days with minimal clinical signs. Diagnosis is carried out by clinical and necropsy observations that should be confirmed by laboratory tests. Post-mortem examination reveals fibrinous pleuropneumonia with massive lung hepatisation and pleurisy, accompanied by accumulation of straw coloured pleural fluid. CCPP is strictly a respiratory disease. One wonders if necropsies were undertaken in the event described. An OIE disease card (etiology, epidemiology, diagnosis, prevention & control) is available at https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/docs/pdf/Disease_cards/CONTAGIOUS_CAPRINE_PLEURO.pdf.

According to the Moroccan daily Istitmar dated 28 Feb 2021, the 1st mortalities (n=47) of this event were recorded in the night of Tue 23 and Wed 24 Feb 2021. The location was visited on Sun 28 Feb 2021 by a team composed of local authorities, gendarmerie, and a veterinarian; no evidence of the cause of the (apparently, sudden) death could be found.
