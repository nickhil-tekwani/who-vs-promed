Senior ecologists and zoologists warned this week of rabies spreading in
Israel following refusal of the environmental protection minister to
authorize a culling of stray dogs, which spread the disease. The scientists
urged Minister Gilad Erdan to revoke the decision he made at the beginning
of the year and allow Israel Nature and Parks Authority inspectors to cull
stray dogs.

The Agriculture Ministry said the rabies eruption in the past year was
marked by a considerable increase in rabid dogs, both stray and pets.
Failure to cull stray dogs increases their numbers, which in turn raises
the risk of spreading the disease, the scientists say. In addition, stray
dogs mean increased attacks on wild animals and threaten the extinction of
certain species, they said.

Until recently, the Veterinary Services in the agriculture and environment
ministries authorized INPA inspectors to cull stray dogs to prevent rabies
from spreading. Erdan demanded the Agriculture Ministry issue regulations
determining what circumstances justify shooting dogs before approving the
culling.

"Stray dogs wandering in packs have significantly reduced gazelles' ability
to reproduce," the scientists wrote to Erdan. "Packs of dogs have devoured
rare roe deer in Ramat Hanadiv and 4 female Persian fallow deer, one of the
rarest species in the world, which Israel is saving from extinction and
returning to the wild," they wrote.

"I've received complaints from several regions about shooting dogs and of
dogs left dying in the field," Erdan said, confirming that he has not
authorized culling stray dogs. "It confuses many people, who think INPA's
job is to protect animals and don't understand why they're shooting dogs. I
found there are no clear regulations saying where and in what circumstances
shooting stray dogs is permitted," he said.

[Since 1 Jan 2010, 10 new cases of animal rabies have been lab-confirmed in
north eastern Israel, including 6 dogs, 2 jackals, a cow and a sheep (note
the absence of foxes!). The 10th case, confirmed on 23 Feb 2010 in an
apparently vaccinated dog in Kfar Baruch, at the centre of the Valley of
Israel, extended the affected area further westwards. The case is under
investigation. The number of rabies cases during the same period (1 Jan-23
Feb) in the previous 5 years, was the following (in brackets, annual
totals): 2005 - 3 (34); 2006 - 0 (9); 2007 - 0 (15); 2008 - 0 (12); 2009 -
6 (58).

Maps showing the distribution of rabies in Israel for 2009 are accessible
at <http://agri3.huji.ac.il/~yakobson/rabheb/mapa2009.html> and for the
period 1 Jan-20 Feb 2010, at
<http://www.vetserv.moag.gov.il/VetServ/Diseases/Rabies/Occurrences/2010/default.htm?ShowType=Map>.

The issue has been elucidated by D David and colleagues of the Kimron
Veterinary Institute in a paper entitled "Emergence of dog rabies in the
northern region of Israel" (Epidemiol Infect 2009 Apr; 137(4): 544-8). Its
abstract says:

"Between 1979 and 2000, foxes constituted the main reservoir of rabies in
the northern regions of Israel. Following the implementation of the
fox-targeted oral vaccination programme (ORV) in 1998, rabies was
eradicated from this area. Subsequently, during 2004-2007, the biological
and molecular characterization of the rabies isolates showed that stray
dogs emerged as the main animal reservoir in northern Israel, while lower
numbers of cases were reported in domestic animals. The virus isolates from
foxes and dogs differed in their molecular characterization, suggesting 2
distinct, separate lineages. The transition from fox-mediated rabies to
dog-mediated rabies is of great concern to public health because of the
close contact between dogs and the human population."

The zoo-ecological aspects of the stray-dog population dynamics in the
affected area as raised by the cited scientists are just one issue at
stake; public health aspects are, to say the least, of no lesser
significance. These should concern the Israeli Ministry of Health. - Mod.AS]
