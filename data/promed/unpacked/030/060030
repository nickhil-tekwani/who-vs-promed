Executive summary
-----------------
10 months after the devastating earthquake of 12 Jan 2010, cholera
appeared in Haiti for the 1st time in nearly a century. The outbreak
subsequently claimed over 4500 lives, sickened almost 300 000 people,
and continues to cause infections and deaths in Haiti.

The source of the cholera has been controversial, with hypotheses
that the pathogen that causes cholera (_Vibrio cholerae_) arrived into
Haiti from the Gulf of Mexico due to tectonic shifts resulting from
the earthquake, evolved into disease-causing strains from
non-pathogenic strains naturally present in Haiti, or originated from
a human host who inadvertently introduced the strain into the Haitian
environment. A specific form of the 3rd hypothesis, that soldiers
deployed from a cholera-endemic country to the Mirebalais Minustah
[United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti] camp were the source
of the cholera, is a commonly held belief in Haiti.

In order to determine the source of the outbreak definitively, the
Secretary-General of the UN formed an Independent Panel of 4
international experts (the "Independent Panel"), with a mandate to
"investigate and seek to determine the source of the 2010 cholera
outbreak in Haiti." To fulfill this mandate, concurrent
epidemiological, water and sanitation, and molecular analysis
investigations were carried out.

On 22 Oct 2010, the 1st cholera case in Haiti in nearly a century was
confirmed at the Haiti National Public Health Laboratory. A review of
hospital admission records along the Artibonite River from the
mountains of Mirebalais to St Marc on the coast clearly showed that a
normal background rate of non-fatal diarrheal disease in adults and
children was abruptly interrupted by the onset of a cholera outbreak.
The 1st hospitalized cholera case in Mirebalais, in the upstream
region of the Artibonite River, was on the evening of 17 Oct 2010. The
1st hospitalized cholera cases on the coast, in the Artibonite River
Delta in St Marc and Deschapelle, were on 20 Oct 2010. The outbreak
was widely established in the coastal areas by 22 Oct 2010. The
timeline suggests that the outbreak spread along the Artibonite
River.

After establishing that the cases began in the upper reaches of the
Artibonite River, potential sources of contamination that could have
initiated the outbreak were investigated. Minustah contracts with an
outside contractor to handle human fecal waste. The sanitation
conditions at the Mirebalais Minustah camp were not sufficient to
prevent fecal contamination of the Meye Tributary System of the
Artibonite River. Water in the Meye Tributary System reaches the
Artibonite River junction in less than 8 hours, and flows downstream
in another 1-2 days to a dam and canal system widely used for
irrigation throughout the Artibonite River Delta.

Several independent researchers studying genetic material from the
bacteria responsible for the outbreak of cholera in Haiti graciously
provided their results to us. They used a variety of molecular
analysis techniques to examine multiple samples of the bacteria. Their
results uniformly indicate that: 1) the outbreak strains in Haiti are
genetically identical, indicating a single source for the Haiti
outbreak; and, 2) the bacterium is very similar, but not identical, to
the South Asian strains of cholera currently circulating in Asia,
confirming that the Haitian cholera bacteria did not originate from
the native environs of Haiti.

The hydrological data, combined with the epidemiological timeline,
and supported by the molecular analysis information verifies that
contaminated river water was the likely route of spread of _Vibrio
cholerae_ from the mountains of Mirebalais to the coastal areas around
the Artibonite River Delta.

These research findings indicate that the 2010 Haiti cholera outbreak
was caused by bacteria introduced into Haiti as a result of human
activity; more specifically by the contamination of the Meye Tributary
System of the Artibonite River with a pathogenic strain of the current
South Asian type _Vibrio cholerae_.

This contamination initiated an explosive cholera outbreak downstream
in the Artibonite River Delta, and eventually throughout Haiti. This
explosive spread was due to several factors, including
- the widespread use of river water for washing, bathing, drinking,
and recreation;
- regular exposure of agricultural workers to irrigation water from
the Artibonite River;
- the salinity gradient in the Artibonite River Delta, which provided
optimal environmental conditions for rapid proliferation of _Vibrio
cholerae_;
- the lack of immunity of the Haitian population to cholera;
- the poor water and sanitation conditions in Haiti;
- the migration of infected individuals to home communities and
treatment centers;
- the fact that the South Asian type _Vibrio cholerae_ strain that
caused the outbreak causes a more severe diarrhea due to the larger
production of the more potent classical type of cholera toxin; and
- the conditions in which cholera patients were initially treated in
medical facilities did not prevent the spread of the disease to other
patients or to the health workers.

The introduction of this cholera strain as a result of environmental
contamination with feces could not have been the source of such an
outbreak without simultaneous water and sanitation and health care
system deficiencies. These deficiencies, coupled with conducive
environmental and epidemiological conditions, allowed the spread of
the _Vibrio cholerae_ organism in the environment, from which a large
number of people became infected.

The Independent Panel concludes that the Haiti cholera outbreak was
caused by the confluence of circumstances as described above, and was
not the fault of, or deliberate action of, a group or individual. The
following recommendations to the UN, to the Government of Haiti, and
to the international community are intended to help in preventing the
future introduction and spread of cholera:

1. The Haiti cholera outbreak highlights the risk of transmitting
cholera during mobilization of population for emergency response. To
prevent introduction of cholera into non-endemic countries, UN
personnel and emergency responders traveling from cholera endemic
areas should either receive a prophylactic dose of appropriate
antibiotics before departure or be screened with a sensitive method to
confirm absence of asymptomatic carriage of _Vibrio cholerae_, or
both.
2. UN missions commonly operate in emergencies with concurrent
cholera epidemics. All UN personnel and emergency responders traveling
to emergencies should receive prophylactic antibiotics, be immunized
against cholera with currently available oral vaccines, or both, in
order to protect their own health and to protect the health of
others.
3. To prevent introduction of contamination into the local
environment, UN installations worldwide should treat fecal waste using
on-site systems that inactivate pathogens before disposal. These
systems should be operated and maintained by trained, qualified United
Nations staff or by local providers with adequate United Nations
oversight.
4. To improve case management and decrease the cholera case fatality
rate, UN agencies should take stewardship in:
a. Training health workers, especially at the treatment center
level;
b. Scaling-up the availability and use of oral rehydration salts at
the household and community level in order to prevent deaths before
arrival at treatment centers; and,
c. Implementing appropriate measures (including the use of cholera
cots) to reduce the risk of intra- facility transmission of cholera to
health staff, relatives, and other patients.
5. To prevent the spread of cholera, the UN and the Government of
Haiti should prioritize investment in piped, treated drinking water
supplies, and improved sanitation throughout Haiti. Until such time as
water supply and sanitation infrastructure is established:
a. Programs to treat water at the household or community level with
chlorine or other effective systems, handwashing with soap, and safe
disposal of fecal waste should be developed and/or expanded; and,
b. Safe drinking water supplies should continue to be delivered and
fecal waste should be collected and safely disposed of in areas of
high population density, such as the spontaneous settlement camps.
6. The international community should investigate the potential for
using vaccines reactively after the onset of an outbreak to reduce
cholera caseload and spread of the disease.
7. Recent advances in molecular microbial techniques contributed
significantly to the investigative capabilities of this report.
Through its agencies, the United Nations should promote the use of
molecular microbial techniques to improve surveillance, detection, and
tracking of _Vibrio cholerae_, as well as other disease-causing
organisms that have the potential to spread internationally.

[Above is the executive summary of the UN report regarding the
circumstances around import to and spread of cholera in Haiti in the
months following the Haitian earthquake (12 Jan 2010). As expected,
the still ongoing epidemic was caused by an unfortunate 'aligning of
the planets':
- the strain was of South Asian origin and imported to Haiti due to
human activity
- it was able to spread due to a poor sanitary system made even worse
in the earthquake's aftermath;
- the specific strain was more virulent than the usual El Tor
strains.
These so-called Matlab variants have some phenotypic characteristics
of the Classical biotype making it more virulent.

Described by Nair et al (1) from the International Centre for
Diarrhoeal Research in Bangladesh, the strains were obtained from
patients with cholera from the Matlab Hospital and they are often
referred to as the Matlab variants.

Formally, the 2 established biotypes can be distinguished from one
another by a number of properties including hemolysis of sheep red
blood cells, agglutination of chicken red blood cells, the
Voges-Proskauer reaction as well as susceptibility to polymyxin B and
to biotype-specific viral bacteriophages. Nair et al, described 3
Matlab types based on the hybrids of these phenotypic traits. A hybrid
strain has also been found in Mozambique (2) which had genetic
relatedness to the Matlab strains (3). Importantly, the Matlab
variants have been shown to have all the necessary genes to initiate a
pandemic (3).
