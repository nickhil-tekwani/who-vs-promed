[As of 28 May 2007,] 10 cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever
(CCHF) had been registered in the Stavropol region. The regional
office of Rospotrebnadzor [Territorial Directorate of the Federal
Services for Consumer Protection and Human Welfare] stated that 5 of
the 10 patients had recovered and been discharged, while the other 5
remained in hospital. Cases of CCHF were confirmed in 8 regions of
the area -- 2 cases each in Budyonovsk and Neftekumsk, and one case
in each of the Apanasenkovskoe, Blagodarnenskoe, Izobilnenskoe,
Ipatovskoe, Krasnogvardeyskoe, and Novoselitskoe districts.
The regional office of Rospotrebnadzor reported that in the majority
of cases the transmission of CCHF by tick bite occurred during
contact with farm animals. In 3 cases, however, the tick bite
occurred during excursions into the countryside. Since the beginning
of the outbreak, a total of 84 people, including 18 children under 14
years of age, have been admitted to hospital on suspicion of having
contracted CCHF. Of the suspected cases, 39, including one child, are
still in hospital.
The regional Rospotrebnadzor office also stated that 2271 people had
sought medical treatment for tick bites, 985 of whom were children.
This year [2007], ticks are very active in the Georgievsk,
Shpakovskoe, Predgornoe, and Mineralovodskoe regions, and in the
cities of Kislovodsk, Pyatigorsk, and Stavropol.
The Rospotrebnadzor office has emphasized the responsibility of those
involved in supervising outdoor activities for children to ensure
that adequate [measures have been taken] for protection from, and
treatment of tick bites.
