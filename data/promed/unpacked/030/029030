This Thursday the deaths of another 17 animals were reported in Bage
and Acegua in the Campanha region, 37 days after the death of more
than 300 bovines as a result of tetanus in the Central Region [of Rio
Grande do Sul. In Palmas, some 70 km from Bage, 14 cows died and
8 have muscular rigidity -- one of the first signs of the disease. Not far
from there in the locality of Minuano, in Acegua, 3 dairy cows are in
the same situation.
With more than a dozen of the animals dead, rural producer Birajar
Jardim Collares said he had immunized 80 percent of the herd with the
contaminated lot of vermicide. Of the 200 bovines living on his 220
hectares of land, 160 received doses of medicine. Collares remembers
he bought the vermicide on 28 Jun 2001 from a veterinarian in Bage.
The chief of the Veterinary Inspectorate, Guilherme Gomes da Silva,
and a technician from the Ministry of Agriculture, Nei Rosa, went to
the property last Friday and made the clinical diagnosis of tetanus. In
the next few days they will have expert confirmation of the disease.
