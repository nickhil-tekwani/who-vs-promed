The Minnesota Department of Health [MDH] reported 3 cases of salmonellosis have been linked to ducklings purchased from Tractor Supply Company in Inver Grove Heights. The cases are part of a multi-state outbreak of salmonellosis being investigated by the CDC.

The ill Minnesotans were age 18 to 60. All 3 cases were caused by _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Infantis, which has been previously associated with poultry. The cases occurred from late March 2013 through early April 2013.

MDH State Public Health Veterinarian Dr Joni Scheftel said the outbreak underscores the importance of washing hands thoroughly after handling chicks, ducklings, or other birds. People typically get salmonella from poultry by hand-to-mouth contact. Usually this happens when people handle birds or objects in their environment and then accidentally touch their mouths or forget to wash their hands before eating or drinking.

Salmonellosis can also be contracted by eating contaminated foods that have not been properly prepared and handled.

9 children younger than 12 have been infected with salmonella since Easter [31 Mar 2013], the Pueblo City-County Health Department reported Tuesday [23 Apr 2013].

The 1st case was documented during the 1st week of April and the last one this week, according to department spokeswoman Sarah Joseph.

The outbreak is believed to be related to contact with live poultry and baby chicks, according to a news release.

Health department Director Dr. Christine Nevin-Woods said anyone who handles poultry or farm animals should wash their hands afterward, and children should be discouraged from cuddling or kissing chicks or ducklings.

Nebraska has had 6 confirmed cases of salmonellosis among children ages 1 to 6 recently, but Nebraska Health and Human Services officials have been unable to confirm a common source of salmonella infection.

This time of year, it could be exposure to live Easter gifts, like baby chicks or ducklings. In fact, 5 of the 6 sick kids had exposure to chicks or ducklings, HHS spokeswoman Leah Bucco-White said in an email. "But we haven't been able to confirm that baby poultry was the source of infection," she wrote.

The cases of 5 girls and one boy are all in eastern and south-central Nebraska. One was hospitalized, later recovered and was released.

[Especially in the spring, outbreaks of salmonellosis are reported from exposure to chicks and/or ducklings. ProMED-mail awaits information from CDC regarding the scope of this year's outbreak. - Mod.LL]

[Salmonella carried in the intestines of chicks and ducklings contaminates their environment and the entire surface of the animal. Children can be exposed to the bacteria by simply holding, cuddling, or kissing the birds. Salmonella can cause diarrhea, vomiting, and fever. Some people are more susceptible to infection and will have more severe disease. These people include young children, pregnant women, the elderly, people on chemotherapy, diabetics, and others with weakened immune systems. Approximately 20 percent of cases reported to MDH are hospitalized.

What a shame! Surely the whole point of getting a nice fluffy yellow chick or duck for Easter is to cuddle and kiss it? But parents beware: a toy fluffy chick or rubber duck is safer.
