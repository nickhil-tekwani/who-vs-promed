Ebola situation report - 14 Oct 2015
-----------------------------------
Summary
-------
No confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) were reported in the week to 11 Oct [2015]. This is the 2nd consecutive week with zero confirmed cases. However, 150 registered contacts remain under follow-up in Guinea, of which 118 are high risk, and an additional 259 contacts remain untraced. There remains a near-term risk of further cases among both registered and untraced contacts. In Sierra Leone, 2 high-risk contacts associated with the 2 most recently active chains of transmission in the country were lost to follow-up and have not yet been found. In addition, a patient who was reported as a case in the United Kingdom on 29 Dec 2014, and who later recovered, was hospitalised on 6 Oct [2015] in the United Kingdom after developing late EVD-related complications. As of 13 Oct [2015], 62 close contacts have been identified in the UK for follow-up.

Case incidence has remained at 5 confirmed cases or fewer per week for 11 consecutive weeks. Over the same period, transmission of the virus has been geographically confined to several small areas in western Guinea and Sierra Leone, marking a transition to a distinct, 3rd phase of the epidemic. A refined phase-3 response coordinated by the Interagency Collaboration on Ebola will build on these measures to drive case incidence to zero and ensure a sustained end to EVD transmission. Enhanced capacity to rapidly identify a reintroduction (either from an area of active transmission or from an animal reservoir), or re-emergence of virus from a survivor, improved testing and counselling capacity as part of a comprehensive package to safeguard the welfare of survivors, and the increased use of innovative technologies -- from vaccines to rapid diagnostic tests -- are central to the phase-3 response framework.

A total of 150 contacts remain under follow-up in the Guinean prefecture of Forecariah, of which 118 are high risk. All contacts are associated with a single chain of transmission centered on the Ratoma area of the capital, Conakry. In addition, 259 contacts in Guinea have been identified but have so far not been traced. Most of these untraced contacts are from Conakry and Forecariah. The 4 most recent cases in Guinea, which were reported on 26 and 27 Sep [2015] from 2 villages in the sub-prefecture of Kaliah, Forecariah, were infected by a 10-year-old girl from Conakry who was an unregistered contact of a probable case linked to the Ratoma chain of transmission.

Sierra Leone reported no confirmed cases for the 4th consecutive week. All contacts linked to the country's 2 most recently active chains of transmission, Bombali and Kambia, have now completed 21-day follow-up. In addition, the last case to receive treatment was discharged from an Ebola treatment centre in Kambia on 26 Sep [2015]. However, 2 high-risk contacts -- one from Bombali and one from Kambia -- remain untraced. Efforts to trace these contacts will continue until 42 days have elapsed since the last reported case in each district.

Robust surveillance measures are essential to ensure the rapid detection of any reintroduction or re-emergence of EVD in currently unaffected areas. Nine operational laboratories in Guinea tested a total of 725 new and repeat samples in the week to 4 Oct [2015] (the most recent week for which data are available from Guinea and Liberia). In Liberia, 928 new and repeat samples were collected and tested in the 4 operational laboratories in the week to 4 Oct [2015]. 1654 new samples were collected in Sierra Leone and tested by 9 operational laboratories in the week to 11 Oct [2015].

Countries with widespread and intense transmission
--------------------------------
Since the beginning of the outbreak, there have been a total of 28 454 reported confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of EVD in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone (figure 1, table 1) up to 11 Oct [2015], with 11 297 reported deaths (this total includes reported deaths among probable and suspected cases, although outcomes for many cases are unknown). No new cases were reported in the week to 11 Oct [2015].

The total number of confirmed cases is similar in males and females (table 2). Compared with children (people aged 14 years and under), adults aged 15 to 44 years of age are approximately 4 times more likely to be affected in Guinea and Liberia, and 3 times more likely to be affected in Sierra Leone. Adults aged 45 years and above are approximately 5 times more likely to be affected in Guinea and approximately 4 times more likely in Liberia and Sierra Leone.

No new health worker infections were reported in the week to 11 Oct [2015]. Since the start of the outbreak, a total of 881 confirmed health worker infections have been reported in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone; there have been 513 reported deaths (table 5).

[3] Scottish nurse now "critically ill"
Date: Wed 14 Oct 2015
Source: BBC News [edited]
http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-34529575


A nurse who contracted Ebola while working in West Africa is now "critically ill" with complications arising from the infection. She was readmitted to a specialist isolation unit at the Royal Free Hospital in London last week. The hospital said in a statement that her condition had deteriorated.

The nurse, 39, from Cambuslang in South Lanarkshire, contracted Ebola while working at a treatment centre in Sierra Leone last year [2014].

She spent almost a month in isolation at the Royal Free at the beginning of the year after the virus was detected when she arrived back in the UK.

She was later discharged after apparently making a full recovery, but it was discovered last week that Ebola was still present in her body. Bodily tissues can harbour the Ebola infection months after the person appears to have fully recovered.

A statement released by the hospital said: "We are sad to announce that [her] condition has deteriorated, and she is now critically ill. She is being treated for Ebola in the high level isolation unit at the Royal Free Hospital." ... - more

[4] Interview with Margaret Chan, WHO

http://news.sciencemag.org/health/2015/10/wake-ebola-epidemic-margaret-chan-wants-countries-put-their-money-where-their-mouth


Science Insider reports on an interview with Margaret Chan, director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO) by Kai Kupferschmidt, contributing correspondent for Science magazine based in Berlin, Germany; she responds to the criticism that has been directed at WHO concerning its handling of the Ebola outbreak.

She discussed the delay in declaring Ebola a Public Health Emergency of International Concern: "Information was not flowing up. That is a big problem. You cannot manage what you don't see and what you don't know. I think all of us underestimated the context of these countries. An old disease in a new context gave us surprises."

She discussed the disproportionate restrictions on travel to and from the Ebola region imposed by 34 countries against the recommendations of WHO: That is part of the "International Health Regulations [IHR], an international treaty with the good intention of building a collective defense system against a common threat. But the implementation of the IHR is very poor; there is a lot of disincentive. Why should I report? The minute I report, you impose a trade ban and travel ban on me. That is why we need to review the IHR and change them to provide incentive instead of disincentive."

Recommendations to change the IHR in the Report of the Ebola Interim Assessment Panel led by Barbara Stocking were not implemented because of lack of resources. Chan said: "That is why the Stocking report made another recommendation: Health cannot be left in the hands of ministries of health alone. It has to escalate so that heads of state, heads of government, will consider the social, financial, and human costs of non-action." ...-more

14 Oct 2015 Nigeria: Ebola: First Consultant Hospital Laments Low Patronage
http://www.leadership.ng/news/466955/ebola-first-consultant-hospital-laments-low-patronage
[Nigeria may have been declared Ebola-free, but at the First Consultants Hospital in Lagos, where [an] Ebola virus disease patient was taken after becoming ill on arrival in Lagos, stigmatisation is the order of the day.

The Chief Medical Director, First Consultant Hospital Centre, Professor Benjamin Ohiaeri, in an interview with LEADERSHIP, said the hospital still battles to regain the trust of patients, adding that the hospital has been deserted since the Ebola outbreak.

Ohiaeri said the hospital spent a lot of money in replacing every piece of potentially contaminated equipment, from the emergency room and laboratory to washing machines in the laundry.

He said the hospital may be open and immaculately clean, but patient numbers are still down, while some of the doctors and nurses who survived Ebola are still treated with mistrust.]

12 Oct 2015 Sierra Leone: Earlier bed delivery could have halved Sierra Leone Ebola outbreak - experts
http://www.trust.org/item/20151012185547-ecykw/?source=fiOtherNews2
[According to new research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the early supplying of thousands of Ebola treatment beds by the UK and Sierra Leone governments, and NGOs, enabled isolation of patients. This prevented an estimated 57 000 Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases and 40 000 deaths in Sierra Leone. The study shows the large impact of local and international involvement early on produced a substantial decrease in transmission of Ebola virus disease (EVD). Providing the beds one month earlier could have halved the number of EVD cases.]

12 Oct 2015 Contamination of Health Care Personnel During Removal of Personal Protective Equipment
http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2457400
[Myreen E. Tomas, MD; Sirisha Kundrapu, MD; Priyaleela Thota, M et al. 2015. Contamination of Health Care Personnel During Removal of Personal Protective Equipment. _JAMA Internal Medicine_. [edited]

[IMPORTANCE. Contamination of the skin and clothing of health care personnel during removal of personal protective equipment (PPE) contributes to dissemination of pathogens and places personnel at risk for infection.

OBJECTIVES. To determine the frequency and sites of contamination on the skin and clothing of personnel during PPE removal and to evaluate the effect of an intervention on the frequency of contamination.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS. We conducted a point-prevalence study and quasi-experimental intervention from 28 Oct 2014, through 31 Mar 2015. Data analysis began 17 Nov 2014, and ended 21 Apr 2015. Participants included a convenience sample of health care personnel from 4 Northeast Ohio hospitals who conducted simulations of contaminated PPE removal using fluorescent lotion and a cohort of health care personnel from 7 study units in one medical center that participated in a quasi-experimental intervention that included education and practice in removal of contaminated PPE with immediate visual feedback based on fluorescent lotion contamination of skin and clothing.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES. The primary outcomes were the frequency and sites of contamination on skin and clothing of personnel after removal of contaminated gloves or gowns at baseline vs. after the intervention. A secondary end point focused on the correlation between contamination of skin with fluorescent lotion and bacteriophage MS2, a nonpathogenic, nonenveloped virus. ...-more]

12 Oct 2015 The Increasing Visibility of the Threat of Health Care Worker Self-contamination
http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2457398
[Michelle Doll, MD; Gonzalo M. Bearman, MD, MPH . The Increasing Visibility of the Threat of Health Care Worker Self-contamination . _JAMA Internal Medicine_. [edited]
The vulnerability of health care workers to acquisition and propagation of infectious agents has received global attention because of recent outbreaks of highly communicable and fatal diseases, including Ebola virus disease and severe acute respiratory syndrome. The emergence of these high-profile pathogens has prompted calls for better personal protective equipment (PPE), specifically, masks, gowns, and gloves, to protect health care workers and patients. In this issue of JAMA Internal Medicine, Tomas and colleagues provide a timely addition to the existing literature on the limitations of our current PPE.

In a series of related studies that use previously described methods to simulate contaminated PPE, the investigators convincingly document a high frequency of health care worker self contamination when using PPE. The bulk of their data come from 435 simulations of donning and/or doffing of gowns and gloves contaminated with a fluorescent lotion: 234 were soiled glove simulations, and 201 were soiled gown simulations. Almost half (46.0 per cent) of these simulations resulted in health care worker self-contamination of skin or clothing. ...-more]

14 Oct 2015: Preliminary study finds that Ebola virus fragments can persist in the semen of some survivors for at least 9 months
http://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2015/p1014-ebola-virus.html
[According to findings published in the New England Journal of Medicine, preliminary results of a study into persistence of Ebola virus in body fluids show that some men still produce semen samples that test positive for Ebola virus 9 months after onset of symptoms.

This study provides the 1st results of a long-term study being jointly conducted by the Sierra Leone Ministry of Health and Sanitation, the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

14 Oct 2015: 1st known case of sexually transmitted Ebola reported
https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/first-known-case-sexually-transmitted-ebola-reported
[A Liberian woman contracted Ebola virus disease (EVD) in March [2015] by having sex with a survivor of EVD, researchers report. Using studies of both people's viral genomes and of their contacts with any other possible sources of the virus, the researchers conclude the woman's disease represents the 1st known case of sexual transmission of EVD. The transmission occurred 155 days after his 2nd test for the presence of Ebola virus in the blood showed him to be clear of the virus.

The genomes of the Ebola virus from the man's semen and woman's blood were not only practically identical but also different from all other Western African Ebola viruses that had been sequenced.

14 Oct 2015: Ebola drug killed by congressional inaction less than 2 years before outbreak
http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/next/body/ebola-drug-halted/
[A decade before the 2014 Ebola epidemic, the United States Department of Defense (USDOD) started a research program that eventually produced a promising drug to treat Ebola virus disease (EVD), one that was fast-tracked for review by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Then, in late 2012, a year and a half before the 1st case of EVD was reported in West Africa, the program was abruptly halted, the victim of political brinksmanship in the United States Congress.

In 2004, there was a close call when a scientist working with mice and the Ebola virus suffered a needlestick injury, which triggered a search for a treatment in case the scientist tested positive. Sarepta Therapeutics was able to, over a weekend, synthesize several compounds which were enough to treat the scientist, who didn't contract EVD after all.

This close call triggered the search for a treatment for EVD. By 2010, Sarepta had a USD 291 million contract for the advanced development of the company's virus therapeutic candidates for Ebola and Marburg, a similar hemorrhagic fever.

In 2012, Sarepta Therapeutics became the 1st Ebola drug candidate to be given fast-track designation by the FDA, a designation meant to expedite the review of a drug that addresses a serious condition and fills an unmet medical need. One month later, as Congress was locked in a standoff over the debt ceiling and the federal government faced austere budget cuts, development of the promising Ebola treatment was suddenly halted.]
