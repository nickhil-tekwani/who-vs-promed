The Official Commission for the Control and Eradication of Outbreaks of African Swine Fever began in Dajabon the contingency plan to control sources of contagion in farms and backyard hatcheries, and announced that in the coming days the measure will be extended to other provinces from the country. The Minister of Agriculture, Limber Cruz, who heads the commission, reported that sources of contagion had been detected in 3 other provinces, which are Monte Plata, Espaillat and San Pedro de Macoris , according to a statement from the institution.

Last Monday [2 Aug 2021] the commission reported the disease had been detected in 11 provinces of the country, among which were Sanchez Ramirez, Santiago, Hermanas Mirabal, La Vega, Montecristi, Elias Pina, San Juan and the National District.

The minister indicated that next Tuesday [10 Aug 2021] the delivery of economic compensation will begin in Sanchez Ram√≠rez according to the current market price to producers whose pigs were slaughtered, so that they are not economically affected. "It has been spreading throughout the country, but at the same speed, the commission we have organized is moving to those points carrying the international and national protocol to eradicate this swine fever wherever it has been detected," said the minister.

The authorities deployed work brigades for the lifting, control and eradication, as well as heavy machines, motor pumps, biosecurity equipment and substances for vehicle disinfection and the area to be intervened. "We will be moving every day to a province to cover everything necessary in terms of the economic loss of this difficult situation the pig industry in the Dominican Republic is going through," said the minister.

ASF has no cure, nor are there vaccines to prevent it, and it is highly contagious, which is why the slaughter of animals is established in the sources of contagion detected to avoid its spread. Contingency work and vehicle disinfection continue to be carried out throughout the province and in a preventive manner in nearby towns, and are carried out in conjunction with the Emergency Operations Center (COE), the Fire Department, National Police, Armed Forces, among other organizations, details the note.

The Dominican Government is applying the norms of international organizations to contain the advance of the ASF by implementing the regulations that the existing sanitary situation requires.
