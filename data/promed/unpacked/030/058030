The Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries and the USDA Reference Lab in Iowa have confirmed that malignant catarrhal fever [MCF] -- also known as ovine herpesvirus-2 -- is the cause of a recent die-off at a deer farm in North Alabama. MCF is a potentially fatal viral disease of cloven-hoofed animals like cattle, deer, and pigs.

The outbreak, which began in May [2014], has been contained to the one farm, and now that the cause has been determined preventative measures to stop the virus from spreading to the remainder of the whitetail herd have been taken.

Domesticated sheep that were not symptomatic, housed in a pen adjacent to the deer, initially had the virus that spread to the deer. Herpes viruses are widely distributed in nature, and long-lived infections can occur in multiple animal species. The herpesvirus associated with sheep is the predominant cause of MCF outside of Africa and is a cause of disease in domesticated animals and whitetail deer in the United States.

According to Alabama State Veterinarian Tony Frazier, "This isolated incident reminds producers how important it is to have strict bio-security measures in place. Diseases like MCF that are asymptomatic in domestic animals can be devastating to native wild animals."

Commissioner of Agriculture and Industries John McMillan said, "This case shows how critical the working relationship is between our agency and the (Alabama) Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. The cause of the die-off was concluded, and both agencies assisted the facility owner with the determining the best course of action."

[Malignant catarrhal fever (MCF) is a generalized, often fatal disease caused by a herpesvirus that infects a variety of ruminants. The clinical course of the disease in individual animals is very varied and it may be peracute, acute, chronic, or mild. In the acute form of the disease, the clinical signs are usually severe inflammation of the mucosae of the respiratory and alimentary tracts and conjunctivae, as well as eyes and skin. The lesions are accompanied by mucopurulent discharge.

MCF is caused by 3 herpesvirus strains, alcelaphine herpesvirus 1 of wildebeests, ovine herpesvirus 2 of domestic sheep, and MCFV-WTD of goats. Neither of these viruses cause clinical disease in their natural hosts. - Mod.PMB
