2005 West Nile Virus Activity in the United States (Reported to CDC
as of 1 Nov 2005)*
-----------------------------------------------
*Currently, West Nile virus (WNV) maps are updated weekly to reflect
surveillance reports released by state and local health departments
to CDC's ArboNET system for public distribution.

As of 1 Nov 2005, avian, animal or mosquito WNV infections have been
reported to CDC ArboNET from the following states: Alabama, Arizona,
Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of
Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas,
Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan,
Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New
Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North
Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South
Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia,
Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming [a total of 49 states].

Human cases have been reported in: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas,
California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho,
Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland,
Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana,
Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina,
North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,
South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Wisconsin, and
Wyoming [a total of 42 states].

Maps detailing county-level human, mosquito, veterinary, avian and
sentinel data are published each week on the collaborative USGS/CDC
West Nile virus web site:

* Cases with neurologic manifestations (such as WN meningitis, WN
encephalitis, WN myelitis)
** Cases with no evidence of neuroinvasion
*** Illnesses for which insufficient clinical information was provided
**** Total number of human cases of WNV illness reported to ArboNET
by state and local health departments.

Neuroinvasive Disease refers to severe disease cases, particularly
West Nile meningitis and West Nile encephalitis.

West Nile fever refers to typically less severe cases that show no
evidence of neuroinvasion. West Nile fever is not currently on the
list of nationally notifiable diseases, and, therefore, it is
optional whether or not state health departments report these cases
to CDC [further explanations of neuroinvasive West Nile virus disease
and West Nile fever are available at the URL above].

"Other Clinical" includes persons with clinical manifestations other
than WN fever, WN encephalitis or WN meningitis, such as acute
flaccid paralysis. Unspecified cases are those for which sufficient
clinical information was not provided.

Total Human Cases Reported to CDC: These numbers reflect both mild
and severe human disease cases occurring between 1 Jan 2005 through 1
Nov 2005 that have been reported to ArboNet by state and local health
departments. ArboNet is the national electronic surveillance system
established by CDC to assist states in tracking West Nile virus and
other mosquito-borne viruses. Information regarding 2005
virus/disease activity is posted when such cases are reported to CDC.

Of the 2581 cases, 1053 (41 percent) were reported as West Nile
meningitis or encephalitis (neuroinvasive disease), 1363 (53 percent)
were reported as West Nile fever (milder disease), and 165 (6
percent) were clinically unspecified at this time. Please refer to
state health department web sites for further details regarding state
case totals.

Note: The high proportion of neuroinvasive disease cases among
reported cases of West Nile virus disease reflects surveillance
reporting bias. Serious cases are more likely to be reported than
mild cases. Also, the surveillance system is not designed to detect
asymptomatic infections. Data from population-based surveys indicate
that, among all people who become infected with West Nile virus
(including people with asymptomatic infections), less than one
percent will develop severe neuroinvasive disease. See: Mostashari F,
Bunning ML, Kitsutani PT, et al. Epidemic West Nile Encephalitis, New
York, 1999: Results of a household-based seroepidemiological survey.
