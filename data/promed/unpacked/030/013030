Tamil Nadu orders probe into bird flu virus report
--------------------------------------------------
The Tamil Nadu government has ordered an inquiry into reports that a strain
of bird flu was found in this south Indian state by an American laboratory.
A media report said 2 days ago that the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention had confirmed that it found the H5N1 bird flu virus
in samples sent by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) when the
disease was raging in many Asian countries last year [2004].
ICMR had sent the samples drawn in 2002 from its referral laboratory at the
King Institute of Preventive Medicine in Chennai. The samples were drawn
from 3 poultry farm workers in Kattangalathur, 45 km from here.
The report caused alarm in the health department here, as poultry is a
major state industry. Following the report, health secretary Sheela Rani
Chunkath held a meeting with experts on Wednesday. King Institute director
Nalini Ramamurthy was also present.
The government has ordered director of medical education P Vijayalakshmi to
investigate the reported bird flu strain found among Tamil Nadu poultry
workers. Ramamurthy, however, dismissed the media report as alarmist and
said: "The disease itself has not been found. The findings were from random
samples taken in 2002."
The 3 poultry workers have not had bird flu and are doing well. Ramamurthy
has, however, sought a clinical study of migratory birds that arrive on
Tamil Nadu's coast in Vedanthangal, north of Chennai, every year saying
this could be a source for the virus strain.

Bird flu strain found in 3 Chennai poultry workers
--------------------------------------------------
Scientists from a partner laboratory of the Indian Council of Medical
Research (ICMR) have found the 1st signs of an avian influenza virus in 3
workers from a poultry farm near Chennai. Only specific protein signatures
of the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain were spotted at ICMR's influenza
referral laboratory in Chennai's King Institute of Preventive Medicine-the
disease itself has not been detected.
Researchers found the H5N1 signs in samples collected in 2002, which was
confirmed by the world's foremost infectious diseases laboratory, the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta late in 2004. Dr
Nirmal K Ganguly, director general of ICMR, told this website newspaper
that he was not aware of such a finding, suggesting that if such a
high-profile exotic virus were to surface in India, his staff would alert
him. However, he was at the moment in total darkness about the discovery.
Dr Jackie Katz of the CDC's Influenza Branch confirmed to this website
newspaper that the 3 people tested positive for antibody to a highly
pathogenic H5N1 virus. Dr Katz added that here is no cause for alarm.
Till now, only these protein signatures have been found, and irrefutable
evidence of whether the deadly H5N1 strain is present in humans in India
can emerge only when the virus is isolated and sequenced.
But virus isolation and sequencing has not been attempted in India, as
there is a lack of such a secure bio-safety facility, said Dr A C Mishra,
director of the National Institute of Virology, Pune. He added that a
high-level meeting is being organised at ICMR soon to take stock of the
situation and decide on the steps to be taken.
The H5N1 strain normally infects only birds -- in poultry it causes
epidemics -- but is worrisome because it has been found to jump the species
barrier and infect humans, like what happened in Hong Kong in 1997, when 6
people died and the entire 1.5 million bird poultry stock of the island had
to culled.
The avian influenza virus has been in the headlines since its outbreak in
East Asia in 2004, and the World Health Organisation (WHO) has issued a
global alert about this highly contagious bug. The WHO Regional
Representative to India, Dr Salim Habayeb, expressed complete surprise that
he was not informed about this finding by the government, even though he
gets a weekly report of prevalent communicable animal and human diseases.
Expressing concern, Dr Habayeb said the H5N1 strain is very [virulent], as
it mutates very quickly -- a benign non-pathogenic strain could quickly
become a deadly virus, since this particular family of bugs are known to
swap genes at a very rapid pace.
But Habayeb says there is no reason to panic, as India has adequate
mechanisms for control of disease outbreaks, citing the effective handling
of the SARS incident.
Indian researcher Dr Nalini Ramamurthy, director of The King Institute of
Preventive Medicine, Chennai said their group chanced upon these 3 cases of
seropositivity in a poultry farm in Kattangalathur, about 45 km south of
Chennai, while routinely monitoring the human population for influenza
antibodies.
All 3 who show positivity have never travelled overseas, nor is any poultry
imported into India from East Asia regions where epidemics have occurred --
so a native exposure to the virus is the only alternative, she says.
Dr Ramamurthy believes that the nearby Vedanthangal Bird Sanctuary, which
is visited by many migratory water birds, could be the source of the
infection. But a study urgently needs to be undertaken to see if the
seroprevalence has spread to other farms or not, says Dr Ramamurthy.
According to the WHO's standard operating procedures, whenever signatures
of such a highly pathogenic strain are found, intensive studies of both the
birds and humans in the area should be undertaken so the source can be
identified. Even Katz suggests that continued testing of humans and poultry
needs to be undertaken so that we may better understand the risks of human
infection with avian influenza viruses.

[H5N1 is a highly pathogenic strain of influenza for poultry. While
numerous H5N1 outbreaks have been reported since late 2003 in most (if not
all) East Asian countries, no single report of an avian flu outbreak from
neighboring India has been documented since 2001. In the above reports it
is stated that the samples in question were drawn in 2002 from 3 local
poultry farm workers and that the seropositive results obtained by the CDC
(Atlanta) have been available in ICMR since late 2004. Poultry is a major
state industry for the area, and migratory birds arrive every year on Tamil
Nadu's coast in Vedanthangal, north of Chennai. Therefore, it is rather
puzzling that 3 people were infected with the HPAI H5N1 while working in
the poultry farm(s), but that no sick or dead birds were ever discovered or
reported by the local or national health authorities, such as ICMR. Any
further information for clarification of this issue is welcome. - Mod.RY]
