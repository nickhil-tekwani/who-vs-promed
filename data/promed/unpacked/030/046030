Epidemiological comments
This species is common and present all year round in Hong Kong. The
majority is resident but migrants have also been recorded in all seasons.

Local poultry farms are routinely under a constant monitoring and
surveillance programme involving serological and virological testing
and have individual farm biosecurity plans, which include bird
proofing of all sheds. All chicken farms are routinely vaccinated
with inactivated H5N2 vaccine and each batch of chickens has 60
unvaccinated individually identified sentinels, which are monitored
over the production life of the batch.

An intensive surveillance system is in place on all poultry farms,
poultry markets, pet bird shops, park birds, and wild birds in Hong
Kong. To date, no spread detected.

[Wild bird species have been previously involved in Hong Kong-based outbreaks.

This report indicates that little egrets are the species involved in
the outbreak. However, the government's website for the Prevention of
Avian Influenza (<http://www.info.gov.hk/info/flu/eng/index.htm>) and
previous reports indicate that both a great egret and a black-crowned
night heron were involved. It is always helpful to know the species
involved as wild birds including the blue magpie, starlings, and the
scaly-breasted munia have tested positive for avian influenza
previously in Hong Kong this year alone. Previously in 2007, a
peregrine falcon also tested positive. - Mod.PC
