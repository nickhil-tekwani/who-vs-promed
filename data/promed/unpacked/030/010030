Two individuals who consumed food items manufactured by Ratner's Retail
Foods, Inc., located at 138 Delancey Street, Manhattan, have been diagnosed
with salmonellosis. Tests of samples of Ratner's cheese blintzes served to
the persons who became ill, as well as samples of unopened boxes of cheese
blintzes, revealed the presence of
_Salmonella_. The New York City Department of Health (DOH) warns that
persons who purchased any variety of Ratner's cheese blintzes from retail
markets within the past six months may be at risk for developing salmonella
if the blintzes are consumed. DOH advises all individuals who have
purchased these blintzes to destroy them or return them to the place of
purchase. Ratner's Retail Foods, Inc. is a separate operation from Ratner's
Restaurant, which is located at the same address listed above.
In response to these incidents, DOH has issued a Commissioner's Order that
halts the production and distribution of any variety of cheese blintzes
from Ratner's Retail Foods, Inc. until DOH is satisfied that there is no
further risk to consumers. DOH is recalling all packages of cheese blintzes
from retail markets and is also excluding from work all individuals who
were involved in the production of frozen blintzes and who may have
contaminated these food products. These workers will be excluded from work
until completion of specimen testing and analysis.
New York City Health Commissioner Neal L. Cohen, M.D., said, "The Health
Department has ordered Ratner's Retail Foods, Inc. to stop manufacturing
and selling any variety of frozen blintzes until we have identified the
source of the _Salmonella_ contamination in these products, and until we
are satisfied that there is no further risk to consumers. The Health
Department is actively investigating this outbreak and is taking steps to
ensure that _Salmonella_ will not spread."
Salmonellosis is a bacterial infection that generally affects the
intestinal tract and occasionally the bloodstream. It is one of the more
common causes of foodborne illness. In 1998, there were 1,869 cases
reported among New York City residents (a rate of 25.5 cases per 100 000
persons). Any person can get salmonellosis, but it is recognized more often
in infants and children.
