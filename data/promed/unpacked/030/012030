First record of _Meloidogyne fallax_ in Australia. JM Nobbs, Q Liu, D
Hartley, Z Handoo, VM Williamson, S Taylor, et al. Waite Research Precinct,
Urrbrae, South Australia, 5064 Australia.
_Meloidogyne fallax_ [Mf] (Karssen, 1996) has been recorded for the first
time in Australia from potato tubers and soil collected in the south east
of South Australia. Identification was based on morphological observations
and DNA sequencing.
Potatoes tubers were found to have blister-like swellings suggesting
infection of the tubers by root knot nematodes. These blisters were
dissected and a few females, males, and juveniles were ... processed to
obtain permanent slides of perineal patterns, whole males and juveniles.
The ... perineal patterns [were] similar to that of [_M. hapla_] Chitwood
except there were no punctations present in the anal region. The perineal
patterns matched the descriptions of Mf ... and _M. chitwoodi_ Golden,
O'Bannon, Santo and Finley, both known to affect potatoes.
The measurements of key elements of the infective juveniles matched _M.
chitwoodi_ and Mf ... very well [and] measurements of stylet, total body
length, and spicules of the males also matched the original description of
Mf. Ribosomal [internal transcribed spacers, ITS] DNA from juveniles was
amplified and cut with restriction enzymes Clal, Accl and Rsal. Fragment
sizes matched those produced by the species Mf ... (known as _M. chitwoodi_
Baexem? type) and differed from those reported for _M. chitwoodi_ (Zijlstra
et al. 1995). The ITS sequences matched that of the published sequence for
Mf... (Zijlstra, 1997) and did not match the sequence of _M. chitwoodi_ ...
(Powers et al. (1997) (Accession Number U963020). It was concluded that our
isolate was Mf.
From anecdotal evidence and ... literature [references], it appears that
Mf ... has been present in Australia for some time. ... _M.chitwoodi_ being
found in a shipment of seed potatoes from Australia sent to South Africa in
1989 (Kleynhans 1989 in Eisenbach & Triantaphyllou 1991) and Stirling and
Watchel (1985) found a root knot nematode during a survey of
potatoes/pastures in the south east of South Australia in 1979/80. The
species was identified as _M. hapla_. However, Mf ... had not been
described when the survey was conducted.
Similarly [nematodes from] affected tubers ... found in 2001 at other sites
around Mt. Gambier and at Mt. Barker in the Adelaide Hills [were] ...
confirmed as Mf ... using morphology and DNA sequencing.

[ProMED-Plant will now report on nematode diseases of the major crops in
its mandate. This is the first such report. Nematode diseases of humans and
other animals have been posted by ProMED-mail for some time. Plant
parasitic nematodes reside in soil. They are either ectoparasitic (attack
plants externally) or endoparasitic (nematode lives within plant roots for
a period of time). All parasitic nematodes use their mouth spears to inject
saliva containing compounds that induce necrosis or galls. Some nematodes
are vectors of plant viruses. Most common endoparasitic nematodes are those
that penetrate roots but others invade bulbs, leaves, and stems. Mf and
other species of _Meloidogyne_ are examples.
Ectoparasitic nematodes feed on root tissues, especially the epidermis and
cortex. They do not usually penetrate and feed on the vascular tissues.
Examples are the stubby-root nematodes (_Paratrichodorus_ and _Trichodorus_
spp. Damage by nematodes is particularly difficult to assess because the
common stunting, chlorosis, and senescence may be due to other causes.
Crops react according to their level of resistance to these pathogens.
Seedlings and young plants are especially susceptible to nematode-induced
disease.
