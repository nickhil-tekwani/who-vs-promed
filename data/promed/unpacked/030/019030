There seems to be a difference between the theory of gmp (good
manufacturing practice) of helva and tahini and "the reality". In our
district we cold not find products of GULSAN, which seemed to cause the
outbreak in Australia, but we investigated the products of the other
involved brand (SERA).
Our laboratory found _S. Typhimurium_ in 5 different jars of helva
(according to flavour and production date). The food safety authority of
our state found more positive jars of helva. Furthermore we found
_Salmonella Typhimurium_ in a Lebanese helva product and _Salmonella_ Group
G in other Helva from Turkey.

[These data do not challenge directly the information provided in the prior
posting for Gulsan products, but to raise the likelihood that the careful
practices describe in that posting may not be the norm for helva and tahini
producers. This thread is cut unless significant new insight is
forthcoming. - Mod.ES
