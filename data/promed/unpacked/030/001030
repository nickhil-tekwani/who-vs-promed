Leptospirosis claims 27 lives in Gujarat
----------------------------------------
At least 27 people in south Gujarat have lost their lives to leptospirosis,
a disease spread by rodents, in less than a week.
With the death of 2 farm laborers on Fri, 13 Sep 2003, the official toll
reached 27 for the last 4 days even as 25 new patients were admitted to the
Surat civil hospital. Officials said 177 victims of the disease from 131
villages are under treatment. The disease has spread in Surat, Navasari,
and Valsad districts. Unconfirmed reports put the toll higher and the
affected patients at over 500.
"We conducted tests on 127 suspected patients of whom 60 tested positive,"
said MK Wadhel, superintendent of Surat's new civil hospital.
"The disease is common during the monsoon. It is caused when barefoot
walkers come in contact with the urine of rats affected by the disease,"
Gujarat health secretary SK Nanda said. "There is no cause for alarm, as
this is a seasonal problem and is under control," he added.
Most of the patients are farmhands belonging to rural regions where people
usually walk barefoot. People with low immunity levels are more susceptible
to the disease, medical authorities said.
In order to cure it, the disease [generally - Mod.LL] needs to be detected
early, within the first 3 or 4 days. However, it can soon cause
irreversible damage to kidney and liver and prove fatal, medical
authorities pointed out.
Surat Medical College has initiated various steps to contain the outbreak
and send medicines to affected villages. "We have started an awareness
campaign in rural areas to make people aware of the causes of the disease.
We have supplied antibiotics to our centers in the affected regions," a
source at the medical college said.

Background data on leptospirosis in India
-----------------------------------------
High rates have been reported from Valsad district (Gujurat) for several
years. 281 cases (34 fatal) were reported in Surat district (Gujurat)
during July to September 1997 -- 60 per cent of cases males, most from
rural areas.
Leptospirosis was demonstrated in 3.2 per cent of febrile patients and 7.0
per cent of febrile patients with jaundice in Delhi (1966). 32 cases were
confirmed in the region during 2000 to 2001. Seroprevalence rates are 8.8
per cent in Chandigarh and 21.74 per cent in Varanasi.
1127 cases were confirmed in Madras during 1997 -- 40.2 per cent of these
_Leptospira interrogans_ serovar icterohaemorrhagiae, 20.0 per cent serovar
canicola, and 14.9 per cent serovar automnalis.
An epidemic (28 confirmed cases) in Orissa during 1999 followed a cyclone.
Outbreaks of "Andaman hemorrhagic fever" were first reported in 1988, and
identified as leptospirosis in 1993. Highest rates occur during October to
November. 19.1 per cent of tribal peoples on the Nicobar and Andaman
Islands are seropositive (highest rates among the Shompens = 53.5 per cent).
The principal reservoirs in this country are rats, pigs, cattle,
bandicoots, dogs, and cats.
The principal species are Leptospira serovars icterohaemorrhagiae,
autumnalis, pyrogenes, grippotyphosa, canicola, australis, javanica,
sejroe, louisiana, and pomona. Serovars autumnalis and icterohaemorrhagiae
have been reported from the mainland. A single infection by serovar
javanica was reported in Madras in 1996 -- the latter had previously been
found only in bandicoots (_Bandikota bengalensis_).

[Leptospirosis is a fairly common disease, usually transmitted to humans
through contact with water contaminated with rodent urine. Direct contact
with non-rodent animals such as dogs may also produce infection, as shown
by an outbreak among children in St Louis county, Missouri in the early
1970s. The illness is extremely variable in degree, ranging from
asymptomatic or very mild to severe liver and kidney failure (Weil's
disease). Classically a biphasic illness, it had been commonly thought that
the treatment was successful only during the early stage. This, however,
may not be entirely true. One case always comes to mind from my clinical
practice regarding leptospirosis. I consulted on a 55 year old man who
every summer camped next to a "pristine mountain spring" (his words) in
upstate New York. After returning home that year, he presented with fever,
headache, icterus, azotemia, and conjuctival suffusions. A diagnosis of
leptospirosis was confirmed serologically. He now camps somewhere else, as
this mountain spring wasn't as pristine as he thought (the others probably
aren't either). - Mod.LL]
