Bird food recalled due to Salmonella contamination
--------------------------------------------------
Kentucky-based Burkmann Feeds announced today [10 Mar 2009] that it
is voluntarily recalling Wild Birds Unlimited Wildlife Blend bird
food after tests conducted by the North Carolina Department of
Agriculture and Consumer Services (NCDA&CS), Food and Drug Protection
Division, revealed the presence of Salmonella bacteria.

Burkmann is recalling 20-pound packages of Wild Birds Unlimited
Wildlife Blend bird food with the specific manufacturing date code
of 81132200 2916 08124, sold exclusively at Wild Birds Unlimited
Stores. The department initiated an investigation following reports
of salmonellosis in dead wild birds found in various locations
throughout the state. NCDA&CS is working with the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration to identify the source of contamination at the manufacturer.

"We are pleased that the testing has enabled us to remove
contaminated feed from the market," said Agriculture Commissioner
Steve Troxler. "Food safety is a number one priority for this
department, for both humans and animals."

Salmonella can affect animals, and there is risk to humans from
handling contaminated bird seed or pet food products. People handling
contaminated wild bird food can become infected with Salmonella,
especially if they have not thoroughly washed their hands after
having contact with the product or any surfaces exposed to these
products. Symptoms [in people] include: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or
bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramping and fever. Rarely, Salmonella can
result in more serious aliments, including arterial infections,
endocarditis, arthritis, muscle pain, eye irritation and urinary
tract symptoms. Consumers exhibiting these signs after having contact
with this product should contact their health care providers.

Wild Birds Unlimited Inc. and Burkmann Feeds are cooperating to
remove all affected product from Wild Birds Unlimited franchisees.
NCDA&CS is advising consumers to discard the product, avoid touching
unsealed product with bare hands and wash their hands thoroughly
after touching unsealed product.

[Salmonella has been in the headlines quite a lot lately, from peanut
butter products to bird seed. Salmonella and other bacteria have
caused problems in bird feeders in the past when the feeders become dirty.

Some birds, such as sparrows may carry Salmonella without being
affected by it, and may pass it to people if there is contact.

It is good to see industry and regulatory people cooperating to
control a contaminated product.
