Of late, diseases like "citrus greening" and "root decaying" have hit orange orchards in the region, forcing farmers to quit their profession. According to the District Agriculture Office: "Citrus greening has been the most destructive of the diseases. Almost all orchards have been hit hard by citrus greening," said the [Kaski] District Orange Producer Association. "Even large orchards are empty."

According to a District Agriculture Official, factors like low quality saplings and improper management of trees are behind the epidemic. "Apart from citrus greening, 'citrus silla' [citrus psyllid; see comment below] is also destroying orchards. Earlier, this pathogen was not seen above the altitude of 1000 metres. However, we have traced it at 1200 metres now."

The epidemic started due to the planting of infected saplings, he said. "We have to destroy all the infected trees and treat the soil to eliminate the disease," he said. "This is the only alternative now."

[Greening is one of the most damaging diseases of citrus crops affecting leaves and fruit. It is caused by fastidious phloem-inhabiting bacteria classified as _Candidatus_ Liberibacter asiaticus (Asian greening; huanglongbing, HLB), africanus (including a subsp. capensis; African greening) or americanus (South American greening). The 3 pathogens can only be distinguished by molecular methods.

Symptoms include blotchy mottling and yellowing of leaves and small, irregularly shaped fruits with a thick, pale peel and bad taste. Early symptoms may be confused with nutrient deficiencies. Affected trees become stunted, bear multiple off-season flowers and may live for only a few years without ever bearing usable fruit.

The diseases are restricted to _Citrus_ and close relatives because of the narrow host range of their psyllid vectors. _Ca._ L. asiaticus and americanus are spread by the Asian citrus psyllid (_Diaphorina citri_). The main vector for _Ca._ L. africanus is the African citrus psyllid _Trioza erytreae_. The pathogens can also be spread by grafting and possibly by seed from infected plants or transovarially in the vectors. Both pathogens and vectors can be spread with plant material.

Disease management requires an integrated approach including use of clean planting and grafting stock, elimination of inoculum, use of pesticides for vector control in orchards and biological control of vectors in non-crop reservoirs. Control using cultural methods, such as interplanting of non-host crops, is being trialled. In areas where a pathogen has not yet been detected, biological control of vectors has been used successfully to reduce insect numbers and, therefore, the risk of HLB outbreaks (for example, see ProMED-mail post 20090601.2034).

In the report above, it is stated that the citrus psyllid vector is being found at increasing altitudes, which may be due to climate warming. Similar effects have been observed for other pathogens and pests (ProMED-mail posts 20160902.4459660, 20160622.4302098, 20160509.4211696 and multiple other posts in the archives). Root rots of citrus (also mentioned above) due to a number of mainly fungal pathogens are known to occur in the region and may be favoured by poor orchard management.
