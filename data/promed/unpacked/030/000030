White nose syndrome (WNS) has arrived in Alabama. WNS is a disease that has killed millions of bats in eastern North America.

On [1 Mar 2012], a team of surveyors from Alabama A&M [Agricultural and Mechanical University] and the National Park Service were conducting a survey on bats in Russell Cave in Jackson County and saw bats that had white patches of fungus on their skin. Physical signs associated with WNS are white fungus on the bat's nose, wings, ears, or tail membrane, although affected bats do not always have visible fungus.

Two bats and tissue samples were sent from Russell Cave to Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study unit at the University of Georgia for testing. They confirmed the symptoms were caused by WNS.

WNS does not pose a threat to humans, pets, or livestock.

WNS is known to be transmitted primarily from bat to bat, but fungal spores may be inadvertently carried to caves by humans on clothing and caving gear. Cave visitors are encouraged to check with landowners before entering any caves or mines, and to follow US Fish and Wildlife Service decontamination protocols to reduce the risk of human-assisted transport of fungal spores.

Bats with WNS often exhibit unusual behavior in winter, including clustering near hibernacula [hibernation retreat] entrances. Affected bats also may leave their hibernacula during the day and may be observed flying or clinging to rocks outside or on nearby buildings. Dead or dying bats are often found on the ground near affected areas.

Although scientists have yet to fully understand white nose syndrome, research has demonstrated the disease is caused by a newly discovered fungus, _Geomyces destructans_, which often grows into white tufts on the muzzles of infected bats, giving the disease its name.

[Information on how to help slow the spread of WNS can be found at http://www.fs.fed.us/r9/docs/apr_2009_caves_closed/white_nose_info.pdf.

As the disease expands to new territories the naive bat populations exposed for the 1st time to the pathogenic fungus are severely hammered. Studies that shed light on the evolutionary processes and the population dynamics of bats following 1st exposure and establishment of the fungus will shed light on the chances of bats to overcome this terrible threat.
