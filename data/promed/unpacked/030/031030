[There is a graph of the cumulative number of monkeypox (MPX) cases as of 8 Jul 2022, available at https://bit.ly/3Pg6Qyp.

An 8 Jul 2022 European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) update stated in summary that this updated rapid risk assessment includes new information on the different clinical picture of MPX cases in the ongoing outbreak. It includes novel insights from a stochastic mathematical model developed collaboratively by ECDC and the European Health Emergency preparedness and Response Authority (HERA) to assess vaccination strategies as outbreak response measures. It also contains references to all the recently produced technical documents on contact tracing and risk communication and community engagement developed in collaboration between ECDC and the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Europe and civil society organisations (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/monkeypox-multi-country-outbreak-first-update). - Mod.TY]

[There are 3 new states added to this list of those with reported monkeypox virus infections. An 8 Jul 2022 report stated that the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) has confirmed 2 cases of monkeypox infection. One case is in a person in the Midlands region and the other is a person in the Lowcountry region. The affected individuals will be monitored until they are no longer infectious to prevent spread of the virus and will be isolated if needed. Appropriate care will be provided as needed (https://scdhec.gov/news-releases/dhec-announces-first-confirmed-cases-monkeypox-infection-south-carolina).

Another new state is Louisiana. The Louisiana Department of Health on Thursday [7 Jul 2022] identified the 1st case of monkeypox in a Louisiana resident (https://www.nola.com/news/healthcare_hospitals/article_b5e27c8a-fe19-11ec-8812-ebe48f38a3c3.html).

On 8 Jul 2022, the West Virginia State health officials say a Berkeley County resident may be infected with monkeypox. The DHHR's Office Laboratory Services conducted the initial testing that identified the probable monkeypox case and the CDC is now conducting testing to confirm the case (https://wvmetronews.com/2022/07/08/first-probable-case-of-monkeypox-identified-in-west-virginia/). - Mod.TY]

Investigation into monkeypox outbreak in England: Technical briefing 3
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Potential levels of the outbreak in England
The outbreak can be considered to fall into one of 4 potential levels of transmission.
Level 1: Incursions from rest of the world -- small numbers of imported cases with limited onward transmission.
Level 2: Transmission within a defined sub-population.
Level 3: Transmission within multiple sub-populations or larger sub-population.
Level 4: Wider significant community transmission -- with potential for endemic and local epi-zoonotic disease.

These may be refined with better understanding of modes of transmission. At present, England is judged to be in Level 2 and is being closely monitored for any evidence of Level 3.

Part 1. Risk assessment
Monkeypox Technical Group -- data and analysis as of 6 Jul 2022.

UK trajectory
-------------
Nowcast and growth: Incidence continues to grow.

The UKHSA monkeypox nowcasting model implies positive growth between 3.8% to 6.7% per day, corresponding to a doubling time of 15 days (90% CI: 10 days, 18 days). This is consistent with modelling from academic partners, which is not included in this report.
Assessment (confidence): The outbreak in the UK is growing (high).

Geographic spread: The proportion of cases in London is relatively stable at 74% of cases in England.
Assessment (confidence): Cases are concentrated in London (moderate).

Ascertainment: Whilst testing is freely available and a mixed population group is being tested, it is likely that there is under ascertainment. Atypical symptoms, including single or scarce lesions, are reported and there are international reports of subclinical infection. A high proportion of cases (79%) for which there is information have no known contact with a confirmed case although these data are primarily available from earlier in the outbreak.
Assessment (confidence): Insufficient information.

UK transmission
---------------
Outbreak level: There is considerable data lag. Of cases with information, 97% (681 of 699) are in gay, bisexual and men who have sex with men (GBMSM). Trends in key epidemiological indicators from case questionnaires are stable, indicating transmission remains within the known high risk GBMSM group, although coverage of questionnaire data is now just 31%.

Where known, more than half had history of STI in the last year (54%, 233 of 445); 30% (123) were living with HIV; 16% (67 of 445) had one or no sexual partners, and 31% (134) had 10 or more sexual partners in the last 3 months. There have been 4 female cases and one child (under 16) in 2022 in England. Indications that transmission has moved outside the current network would be multiple cases in women or children. Despite potential uncertainty around ascertainment, there is no evidence of this in the UK at present.
Assessment (confidence): Level 2 (moderate).

Route of transmission: Whilst the primary reported route is through close or sexual contact, monkeypox virus has been detected in air and environmental samples in the hospital room of infected patients. There are no confirmed instances of airborne transmission. Limited household transmission has been described in the UK.
Assessment (confidence): Transmitting primarily through close or sexual contact (moderate).

Severity
--------
Observed clinical severity: Approximately 10% of cases receive hospital care, but this includes some cases admitted as unable to isolate at home. Antiviral therapy is an unreliable indicator at present. There are no reported deaths in the UK. In the 2022 global outbreak, 3 deaths have been reported from 6027 cases. There is significant morbidity in the majority of people who are admitted to hospital for clinical care reasons, including complications due to secondary bacterial infection.
Assessment (confidence): In current population group, low mortality but significant morbidity (moderate). In wider population, insufficient data.

Virological characterisation: Outbreak cases are current in a distinct clade which has mutations of unknown significance. There is evidence suggestive of previous human transmission but not clear-cut evidence of adaptation for improved human transmission. There are no phenotypic data available for this clade to date.
Assessment (confidence): Insufficient data.

[An additional 8 Jul 2022 UK Government report indicated that a vaccination program is beginning, and sexual health services will offer the vaccine to anyone considered to be at higher risk of exposure. This includes people with a recent history of multiple partners, participating in group sex, attending sex on premises venues, or have recently had a bacterial sexually transmitted infection (https://www.gov.uk/government/news/monkeypox-continuing-transmission-in-interconnected-sexual-networks). - Mod.TY]
