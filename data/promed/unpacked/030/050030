Meningitis claims 500
----------------------
The West African state of Niger said on Thu, 6 Mar 2003, meningitis
had killed at least 130 people in 2003, taking the regional death
toll from the disease to more than 500 in only 2 months. Niger's
government said in a statement that 1172 cases had been recorded by 3
Mar 2003.
At the end of last month neighbouring Burkina Faso, one of 18
countries in the "meningitis belt," which stretches from Senegal in
the west to Ethiopia in the east, said meningitis had killed more
than 400 people since the start of the year.
Niger said 6 of the victims in its count had died of the virulent new
W135 strain, which devastated Burkina Faso last year, killing 1743
people.
The strain is not prevalent in Burkina Faso or Niger and was believed
to have been brought to West Africa last year by Muslim pilgrims
returning from Saudi Arabia.
Meningitis usually strikes in the first few months of the year in the
dry season. It is transmitted by direct contact. Overcrowding and
hot, dusty climates favor the disease. Both Burkina Faso and Niger
are impoverished, land-locked former French colonies on the fringes
of the Sahara desert.
