Rift Valley fever in Saudi Arabia
As of 17 Sep 2000, the Health Ministry of Saudi Arabia reported 16 deaths
in humans, 14 males and 2 females, from Rift Valley fever in the Jizan
region in southwestern Saudi Arabia. Laboratory confirmation of the disease
was made by the WHO Collaborating Centre at the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. A total of 38 suspected
cases has been reported. No additional cases have been reported in the past
two days.
The Health Ministry is implementing control measures, including the rapid
disposal of dead animals and intensive application of insecticides to
eradicate mosquitoes and larvae. Health education messages about handling
sick and dead animals and ways to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes are also
being disseminated to the population in the affected region.
The Yemen Ministry of Health sent a team to the area bordering Saudi Arabia
to intensify surveillance for human and animal disease. No suspect cases
have been reported in Yemen.
Prior to this report, Rift Valley fever has been confined to the African
continent.

All schools and colleges in Jizan have been closed indefinitely as a
precautionary measure to prevent the spread of a potentially fatal viral
disease identified as Rift Valley fever which has hit the region over the
past week, killing 18 people and affecting 32 others.
However, Health Minister Osama Shubokshi, who was in Jizan which borders
Yemen to supervise preventive measures, declared Saturday that the
situation in Jizan was satisfactory and there was nothing to worry about.
"Don't worry, the situation is under control. We have identified the
virus." the minister told reporters after inspecting hospitals in the
region. He said he was visiting the region following orders from the higher
authorities.
"As the number of victims increased, the Jizan governorate has decided to
close all schools, institutes and colleges in the region until further
notice," Al-Madinah Arabic newspaper reported. But Shubokshi said the
schools were closed to spray insecticides and clean the premises.
Medical experts believe the virus came to the region through sheep imported
from Africa. A large number of sheep have died in Jizan following infection
with the disease. The outbreak was first reported in Al-Ardah town where
victims have suffered high fever, diarrhea, and bleeding. In some cases,
the disease has developed into kidney and liver failures, causing death. An
official source at the ministry said it was the first time that Rift Valley
fever had appeared in the Kingdom.
He said the virus was transmitted to humans from animals either through
direct contact or by mosquitoes. Health officials said there was an
effective vaccine against the disease for animals.

Saudis Ban Some Livestock Imports to Fight Disease
--------------------------------------------------
Saudi Arabia said Monday it was banning the import of livestock from
several African and Arab countries to fight the Rift Valley Fever, a
disease which has killed at least 16 people in the kingdom.
A Health Ministry official told the official Saudi Press Agency that the
ministry had rushed experts to the affected region in southwest Saudi
Arabia where they were spraying mosquito-infested areas, getting rid of
dead livestock and controlling the movement of other livestock.
Measures also included a temporary ban on the import of sheep, goats and
camels from countries including Somalia, Djibouti, Eritrea, Kenya,
Ethiopia, Sudan and Yemen where the official said similar cases had been
reported in the past.
Saudi Arabia Sunday said at least 16 people died and another 38 were being
treated in hospitals following the outbreak of the disease in Jizan area,
near the Yemeni border.
Rift Valley Fever, a hemorrhagic disease, is spread from livestock to
humans by mosquitoes or by contact with infected animals.
Saudi newspapers had earlier reported up to 30 deaths in Jizan from a
mysterious disease.
Neighboring Gulf Arab states, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, said
Monday they had not been affected by the disease. Qatar said it was not
planning to stop the import of livestock from Saudi Arabia.

[The first report is the WHO official confirmation of Rift Valley fever
outside of Africa. This report gives a case fatality rate of 42 percent,
much higher than expected, suggesting a significant underreporting of the
milder cases.
In the second report, the press mentions that schools were being closed due
to the epidemic, but the Ministry of Health official clarified the closures
as being done to permit the spraying with insecticides. It should be
emphasized that disease transmission is primarily through bites of infected
mosquitoes and from handling uncooked meat of infected animals and NOT
through person-to-person contact.
The banning of animals from Somalia, Djibouti, Eritrea, Kenya, Ethiopia,
Sudan and Yemen seems to be based on prior reports of RVF in Somalia and
Kenya. In 1997-1998 there was a major epidemic of RVF in Somalia and
Kenya. To date there have not be reports of RVF in Djibouti, Eritrea,
Ethiopia, Sudan and Yemen, but given the proximity to other areas of known
prior transmission in areas with less than complete reporting this may be
the justification behind the decision. - Mod.MPP
