Wildlife officials knew some deer would die in the Black Hills this fall [2012]. No one expected what could be the worst die-off in decades.

Called epizootic hemorrhagic disease, or EHD, the disease typically strikes fawns and bucks and is worse during droughts. Biologists first found the disease in the Black Hills in the 1950s.

"Our deer numbers are down right now anyway, and this sure isn't helping anything," said Joe Sandrini, a Wyoming Game and Fish Department biologist based in Newcastle.

The disease is spread by a type of biting gnat. White-tailed deer are most often affected. It's worse during dry years because deer congregate in larger groups near diminishing water sources. A hard frost will kill the gnats, but when temperatures don't drop low enough, the gnats -- and the disease -- persist, Sandrini said.

It cannot be spread to humans or most other wildlife and is not a threat to humans, Sandrini said.

Dying deer may be lethargic, appear to be drooling and congregate near water. If a deer succumbs to the disease, it typically dies within 3 days of infection, Sandrini said.

Biologists won't know the extent of the die-off until mid-October [2012] after they begin calculating the herd estimates. It seems to be worse in the northern part of the Black Hills, Sandrini said.

Sundance Game Warden Chris Teter started fielding calls from concerned residents around [1 Sep 2012] and has since received dozens reporting dead or dying deer. "I've not had this many calls ever before, even during an outbreak," said Teter, who has been the game warden for 22 years.

The drop in fawn numbers will hit the population particularly hard. It is still trying to recover from the harsh 2010-2011 winter, Sandrini said.

Deer hunting season in the Black Hills does not open until 1 Nov 2012. Sandrini expects the season to proceed as normal. Wyoming biologists have already set the lowest deer quotas and shortest season in decades.

The disease is widespread, killing deer in 15 other states, he said.

The last major outbreak hit around 2005. Some officials wonder if herd immunity to the disease is down -- some deer will not die of the disease even if infected -- leading to the current situation, he said.

The disease can also occur in antelope, elk, and mule deer.

State wildlife officials have confirmed that samples submitted from deer found dead in Dane, Sauk, and Waukesha counties have tested positive for epizootic hemorrhagic disease, or EHD. A number of citizens in southern Wisconsin contacted the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) with recent observations of small groups of dead deer. EHD has now been confirmed in Columbia, Rock, Sauk, Dane, and Waukesha counties.

DNR wildlife health specialists submitted the samples for testing to Michigan State University's Diagnostic Center for Population & Animal Health, which confirmed they died of EHD. Additional tests of deer from Columbia, Iowa, Jefferson, and Marquette counties are pending and expected within the next 1 to 2 weeks.

"Our neighbor states have been seeing EHD outbreaks for the last several weeks and now it has made its way into southern Wisconsin," Eric Lobner, DNR southern Wisconsin wildlife supervisor, said.

"It is a fairly common disease carried by midges, commonly referred to as 'no see ums', which are not a threat to humans, so there is no cause for alarm. We are fortunate that the public is tuned into our deer and was quick to report these small pockets of problems. By sharing information about the outbreak, we are hoping to get help from the public by providing more eyes on the ground in order to continue to collect observations of sick or dead deer. These observations will help us more clearly understand the geographic distribution and number of deer affected by this disease, and help inform our deer management decisions for next season. We are optimistic, with the cold overnight temperatures recently that we will soon see this outbreak come to an end."

EHD is often fatal, typically killing an infected deer within 7 days. The last EHD observation in Wisconsin was in 2002 in Iowa County where 14 deer died from the virus. EHD is common across southern states and occasionally shows up as far north as the upper Midwest. This year [2012], outbreaks of EHD have been reported in Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa. The disease is typically short lived as the flies that transmit the disease die with the 1st hard frost.

Individuals that observe deer exhibiting the following signs are encouraged to report their observations to the DNR:
- Excessive salivation or foaming around the nose and mouth.
- Appearing weak and approachable by humans.
- In or near water sources. They will often lie in water to cool down or drink.

Wildlife officials say there is no risk to people or pets from deer that have died of EHD and that the venison is safe to eat. Deer carcasses can be left on the landscape to decompose. The DNR will not be collecting or removing deer that have died as a result of this outbreak.

As a result of this confirmation, the DNR is no longer collecting samples from dead deer found in Columbia, Rock, Dane, Sauk, and Waukesha counties; however, officials do want to take samples from dead deer reported in counties where EHD has not been confirmed. Also, in order to monitor the geographic distribution and the number of deer affected by this EHD event, the DNR does want people to continue to report sick or dead deer within Columbia and Rock counties.

"Often in cases of diseases like this, once we have confirmed the presence of the disease our goal is to have a better handle on the distribution and the number of deer that are affected by the disease," Lobner said.

"Keeping a close eye on the health of our deer is important. Though there is little we can do to prevent the disease, with the onset of cold weather and frost, this outbreak should be over soon. Any information we can get will help us better understand the impact of the disease on our herd. "

Florida is the latest state to report the presence of epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) in its white-tailed deer herd. This viral disease has been confirmed in 2 deer and suspected in at least 10 others from North Florida that were examined this year [2012].

EHD is an insect-borne disease, transmitted to deer by small biting flies known as midges or "no-see-ums." The disease can cause illness or death in individual deer but should disappear when freezing temperatures halt insect activity. EHD cannot be transmitted to humans or pets; however, as a general rule, people should avoid consuming sick or unhealthy deer.

"This is a disease that you typically see in late summer or the fall, and it often occurs after periods of drought," said Dr Mark Cunningham, wildlife veterinarian for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC). "The good news is we don't expect long-term impacts to our state's deer herd."

Deer infected with EHD may have pronounced swelling of the head, neck, and tongue, and often have large ulcers in the mouth. Infected deer are often found near water and may be lethargic, lame and emaciated.

[EHD is the most important disease of white-tailed deer. Outbreaks are common in many USA states. However, the magnitude of the outbreaks depends on climatic factors that influence the fitness of the vector. This year (2012) the outbreaks appear to be more severe than usual in some states.
