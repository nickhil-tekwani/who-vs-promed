Fowl traders blame Malaysian eggs for bird flu outbreak
-------------------------------------------------------
The Indonesian government has yet to find the source of the bird flu
outbreak in the country but suddenly, a fowl traders association is blaming
it on hatching eggs smuggled from Malaysia. The Federation of North Sumatra
Fowl Associations (Gapsu) claimed that the outbreak was caused by the
distribution of hatching eggs smuggled from Malaysia besides the entry of
chicken from areas already infected with the virus, like Java and Thailand.
"From 23 Aug 2004 the Indonesian government has banned the import of fowl
products from Malaysia but to date, their hatching eggs can still be found
in North Sumatra," said Gapsu secretary-general Djoko Sugiarto. He was
quoted by the Kompas daily in Medan today as saying that Gapsu had reported
the matter to the Veterinary Services Department in Medan, including about
hatching eggs from Malaysia used by a breeding company in North Sumatra.
The daily also quoted a local Veterinary Services Department officer as
saying that the bird flu outbreak in North Sumatra might have been caused
by a fighting cock smuggled from Thailand. "We have identified the owner of
the fighting cock and he has admitted to smuggling it from Thailand," he said.
The Media Indonesia press, meanwhile, reported that 4 seaports in Batam,
namely Sekupang, Batuampar, Telaga Punggar and Pusat Batam, were placed
under strict surveillance to prevent the entry of items that could carry
the bird flu virus including chicken eggs and dressed chicken. In Jakarta,
Indonesian Health Minister Siti Fadilah Supari said the government had not
been able to determine the source of the bird flu virus which was suspected
to have claimed one life in Tangerang. She said the virus could have been
brought by migratory birds on their sojourn from the northern hemisphere to
Australia. Media Indonesia also reported that about 383 000 chickens had
died of bird flu in south Sulawesi since March 2005.
Muhammad Kafil, bird flu prevention coordinator with the South Sulawesi
Veterinary Services Department in Ujung Pandang, was quoted as saying that
the virus could have been spread through chicken excrement fertilizer which
was widely used by farmers.

Bird flu found in 21 Indonesian provinces: official
---------------------------------------------------
Bird flu outbreak has affected 21 out of 30 provinces in Indonesia with the
number of chickens killed by the virus totaling 9.53 million, a government
official said here on Thursday.
Bird flu cases have been found in at least 132 regencies and cities across
Indonesia, said Mathur Riyadi, director general of veterinary with the
Ministry of Agriculture. Further investigation also indicated preliminary
attack of bird flu in 4 other provinces, namely South Sulawesi, Jambi, East
Kalimantan and North Sumatra, he said on the sidelines of a hearing with
legislators at the parliament compound.
Earlier on Wednesday [20 Jul 2005], the Ministry of Health confirmed that 3
people in the same family in the town of Tangerang have died recently from
bird flu, becoming the country's first human deaths caused by the virus.

[The 1st article above includes creative finger-pointing at several
possible sources for introduction of AI into Indonesia -- hatching eggs
from Malaysia (a country that hasn't really reported AI), a smuggled
fighting cock from Thailand, and migratory birds en route to Australia. The
2nd article, a corollary to the 1st, describing the presence of HPAI in
21/30 provinces, is rather significant -- 70 per cent of the country, with
fairly extensive geographic coverage. - Mod.MPP
While avian influenza could have been introduced by traded and smuggled
animals and their products, one should exercise caution when such
allegations are expressed by commercial sources. Nevertheless, these
allegations do fall in line with an earlier statement by the Indonesian
authorities: the last follow-up report (No 9; see 20050705.1905) from
Indonesia to the OIE, sent on 27 Jun 2005, mentioned -- as "source of
outbreaks" -- introduction of new animals/animal products, as well as
illegal movement of animals. A fresh update is urgently needed. - Mod.AS]
