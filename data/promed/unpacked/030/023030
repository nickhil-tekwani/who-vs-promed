Dr. Phan Van Cong, head of communicable disease control, biological vaccines, preventive health center of Nghe An province, confirmed the province doesn't have any patients infected with influenza A/H5N6, as the media had announced.

In mid-March 2015, an outbreak of influenza A/H5N6 erupted in chickens at communal Sense Spring (district of Nghe An), where dozens of infected chickens died.

On 3 Mar 2015, the patient caught a cold and developed high fever. His wife also had a cold with high fever. Relatives took the couple to hospital Central. After doing tests, the hospital reported 2 patients with influenza A. After 6 days of treatment at a hospital on the Central Lowland, the patients have stabilized and recovered. The couple is expected to be discharged from hospital 6 Apr 2015.

[Nghe An is a province in the North Central Coast region of Viet Nam and is the largest province by area.

Although following laboratory work-up, these 2 cases turned out to be seasonal influenza A and not A(H5N6) as previously reported by the media, the latter virus is still of significant concern, as it has demonstrated the ability to infect humans. H5N6 has caused at least 7 poultry outbreaks in Viet Nam with the initial outbreak in April 2014. In September 2014, for one, there was a massive cull of 800 000 ducks in Quang Nam province (http://www.talkvietnam.com/2014/09/ah5n6-flu-virus-quang-nam-culls-800000-ducks/). The country has been on alert for this virus through intensified surveillance, both in poultry operations and in human respiratory samples. See ProMED Avian influenza, human (83): Viet Nam (NA) H5N6 20150405.3278754 for further discussion of H5N6 in Viet Nam and concern over the potential for reassortant viruses to occur.
