Belgium's new health minister has imposed restrictions on the pork industry
as a food scare spreads beyond the country's borders.
Luc van den Bossche said he would name pig farms which had used animal feed
tainted with a cancer-causing chemical, and have their products withdrawn
from sale.
Similar bans are already in force for Belgian poultry producers, which have
used the dioxin-contaminated feed.
Mr van den Bossche, on his first full day as health minister, said: "For
pigs...we will operate in the same way as with chickens." "We will get pork
out of the shop racks as much as possible." He said officials were drawing
up a list of pig farms, which has used the suspect feed."
The EU (European Union) ban, which stopped short of imposing a total ban on
Belgian poultry, was made before the pig connection was announced in
Belgium. The EU did warn that member states should apply the same rules for
non-poultry products, should other livestock have been fed the tainted
feed. But it cannot automatically extend the current order without another
order
from chief veterinary officers.
