Case is largest of its kind in SC history
-----------------------------------------
With the number of people reporting symptoms from the salmonella outbreak
in Camden, SC rising to 272 on Fri 27 May 2005, the Department of Health
and Environmental Control (DHEC) is faced with its largest foodborne
illness investigation in recent state history.
State health officials will work over the weekend to determine the source
of salmonella at the Old South Restaurant, according to Missy Reese,
spokesperson for DHEC's Wateree Health District. Answers likely won't come
earlier than Tue 31 May 2005, she said.
The death of a 58-year-old Lugoff resident also has been linked to the
outbreak, which affected people who ate at the Camden restaurant from 19-22
May 2005, state health officials said. The number of hospitalizations was
at 50 by Fri 27 May 2005.
The state DHEC set up 4 hot lines for people who might have been sickened
by the outbreak, though Reese said calls were tapering off. "We're getting
toward the end of the incubation time," she said. Salmonella can take up to
72 hours to cause such symptoms as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and fever.
Reese said it was "too early to say" whether the agency will reevaluate how
it inspects and rates restaurants or issues public health advisories as a
result of this week's events. "The Legislature approves any regulations and
sets the laws that we follow," she said. "We just follow the protocol."
DHEC spokesman Thom Berry said the agency moves quickly to notify people
who might have been affected by a foodborne illness. Most of those come
from small gatherings like family reunions, he said, adding that a
situation like the one in Camden is "very rare."
The largest food-borne illness outbreak before Camden was in 1996 in
Greenville, when 244 people got sick. No deaths were reported.
