HEPATITIS B & C AND SUBDERMAL ELECTRODES (6)
=============================================
Subject: Re: Subdermal Needle Electrodes
Further to previous postings about such electrodes and risk of HIV or
hepatitis transmission, there are two interesting items in the recent
popular press. An outbreak of hepatitis in Ontario attributed to such
electrodes was reported the other day by the national television news, and
the Ontario College of Physicians & Surgeons has (according to Canada News
Wire) just urged its members to immediately ban reusable subdermal needle
electrodes. If anyone knows of publications in the biomedical literature
giving more information about these events, I'd appreciate any leads.
