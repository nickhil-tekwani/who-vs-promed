Properties quarantined in Hendra outbreak
-----------------------------------------
Queensland Primary Industries minister Tim Mulherin has confirmed there has
been an outbreak of Hendra virus among horses at a property near
Rockhampton in the state's central region.

A horse stud at Cawarral, east of Rockhampton, was placed in quarantine
after the death of a horse on Saturday [8 Aug 2009]. A neighbouring
property has also been quarantined as a precaution. The deaths of 3 horses
are being investigated.

Stud manager Deb Brown says she is not surprised by the positive Hendra
virus test result, but the death of the horse was upsetting. "Her dying so
suddenly and so violently was a bit of a shock," she said. "The outcome to
me actually wasn't a shock because all the symptoms were there. [Animals
are unable to report how they feel [their symptoms] so we have to rely on
astute observation of clinical signs to make diagnoses. - Mod.TG] "I was
expecting a positive result from these tests."

Ms Brown says strict hygiene measures are in place to try to stop other
horses being affected. "We have to suit up and wash down and mask and
gloves," she said. Three humans have died in 11 previous outbreaks of
Hendra virus, which spreads to horses from flying foxes.

A Brisbane man died of the virus [infection] last year [2008] after
catching it working at a vet clinic in Redlands, on the city's southern
outskirts. His workmate also caught the virus but recovered. The virus,
which can transfer from horses to humans, first emerged in Brisbane 16
years ago and experts say someone can go from having symptoms to being
gravely ill in less than 24 hours. [Symptoms are what people tell us about
how they are feeling and where they hurt. - Mod.TG]

The Australian Animal Health Laboratory is working with an American team on
what they say is a "very promising" vaccine against Hendra virus, suitable
for people and horses.

[The virus was first isolated in September 1994 from horses by the
Australian Animal Health Laboratory, the Department of Primary Industries
and Fisheries' (DPI&F's) Animal Research Institute, and Queensland Health.
Although originally classified as a _Morbillivirus_, the virus has now been
reclassified and named Hendra virus (HeV), a member of a new genus
(_Henipavirus_) in the family _Paramyxoviridae_. The name Hendra reflects
the name of the Brisbane suburb where the disease was first detected.

Hendra virus can cause a range of clinical signs and should be considered
where there is acute onset, fever, and rapid progression to death
associated with either respiratory or neurological signs. Most cases in
horses are fatal but occasionally a horse will survive the infection. The
reported mortality rate in affected horses is greater than 70 per cent. No
other animal is known to be infected naturally.

A total of 6 cases of human infection have been recorded, of which 3 have
died. Human infections have occurred from handling infected horses (ill
horses and during autopsies), so great care should be taken in regard to
personal protective measures. In particular, contact with blood and other
body fluids (especially respiratory and nasal secretions, saliva, and
urine) and tissues should not occur.

There is no evidence of human-to-human spread or human-to-horse spread of
Hendra virus.

Contamination should be avoided but if it occurs, the contaminated human
skin should be washed thoroughly with soap and water, ideally by taking a
shower. Any cuts or abrasions sustained by a person that becomes exposed or
contaminated should be cleansed thoroughly with soap and water. If
available, an antiseptic with anti-virus action such as povidone-iodine,
iodine tincture, aqueous iodine solution, or alcohol (ethanol) should be
applied after washing.

When Hendra virus is suspected and potential human exposure occurs, medical
advice should be sought.
