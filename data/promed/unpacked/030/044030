Serology and viral isolates to date confirm that the New Jersey
serotype of VSV is the cause of the current epizootic.
On 19 Aug 2004, the Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic
Laboratory (FADDL) in Plum Island, NY confirmed vesicular
stomatitis in an Alpaca at a premise in Freemont County, Colorado.
Trade Restrictions:
Korea:
Suspended the import inspection of animals
susceptible to VSV, such as horses and swine, etc., which were
produced or raised in these states on, or after, 20 Apr 2004
(Texas), 15 May 2004 (New Mexico).
Canada:
Live equine, porcine, or ruminants including camelids. Ban covers
all states known to be infected with vesicular stomatitis and will
remain in effect while there is a vesicular stomatitis quarantine in
the state.
European Union:
All U.S. horses being exported to the EU now require a negative
[less than? - Mod.JW] (1:12) virus neutralization test for vesicular
stomatitis. Samples must be taken within 10 days of export. In
accordance with EU regulations, this test requirement will continue
until 6 months after the vesicular stomatitis outbreak. EU horses in
the United States, and horses scheduled to return to the EU, must
be certified not to have been on an affected holding during their
time in the United States.

[The previous ProMED-mail post 20040828.2402 contained a
statement indicating that VSV was a deadly virus. Although animals
may die from the results of the virus, most animals recover. During
the period of disease and recovery, there is economic loss to the
producer, as these animals are in pain and often lose weight,
because they do not care to eat or to walk to feed and water.
Generally, it takes a few months for the animals to recover, but
death, or euthanasia, is not the usual course with this disease. -
