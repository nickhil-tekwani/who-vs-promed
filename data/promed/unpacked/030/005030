Comment on host selection by _Culex_ spp. mosquitoes
----------------------------------------------------
The apparent failure of chickens to serve as a suitable indicator of West
Nile virus transmission has been curious, but must relate to important
differences in the host-seeking behavior of female _Culex_ mosquitoes in
the _pipiens_ and _sitiens_ complexes.
In Australia, California, and Florida, chickens work very well as sentinels
and are an excellent surveillance tool for monitoring viruses in the
Japanese encephalitis virus complex transmitted by the species _Cx.
annulirostris_, _Cx. tarsalis_, and _Cx. nigripalpus_, respectively.
Chickens have been used routinely to monitor other vector-virus
combinations in the United States, including St Louis encephalitis and _Cx.
quinquefasciatus_ in the midwest.
When [if? West Nile virus makes its way to Florida and western North
America, I believe that chickens will be a useful surveillance tool. Having
worked [for some years on St Louis encephalitis virus in California, it
remains difficult for me to understand how mosquitoes that feed on birds in
the tree canopy and on humans and horses at ground level somehow manage to
ignore chickens, regardless of where they are placed.
Revisiting the host selection behavior of _Culex_ mosquitoes using modern
immunological and molecular techniques would seem an important step in
understanding the epidemiology of these viruses in North America.
