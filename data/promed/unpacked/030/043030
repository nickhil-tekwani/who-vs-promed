A monkeypox outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has claimed 10 lives, while 141 people have been infected so far, local media reported on Tuesday [1 Sep 2020].

"From the 1st week of surveillance until the 33rd, we recorded 141 confirmed cases, with 10 deaths," Dr. Aime Alengo, a health official in Sankuru province, told the local Actualite news website.

Alengo said the disease affects those who are mostly less than 5 years old. "We are one of a few countries in Africa that still have cases of this disease."

In its Health Emergencies Bulletin on Tuesday [1 Sep 2020], the World Health Organization (WHO) Africa Region said: "One major challenge to the current emergency includes acquiring the required funding to respond to all the multiple ongoing outbreaks in the country."

Monkeypox virus is an _Orthopoxvirus_ that causes a disease with symptoms similar, but less severe, to smallpox. While smallpox was eradicated in 1980, monkeypox continues to occur in countries of Central and West Africa.

Monkeypox virus is mostly transmitted to people from wild animals such as rodents and primates, but human-to-human transmission also occurs, according to WHO.

[Apparently, the monkeypox (MPX) case count above is for the Sankuru province only. A recent WHO report indicated that nationally, as of 9 Aug 2020, there were 3567 MPX cases with 132 deaths (see Monkeypox - Africa (06): Congo DR, WHO 20200829.7727068). This has been an active year for MPX virus transmission in the DRC. As noted previously, MPX virus is endemic in the DRC, and the above report, as well as the WHO post, indicates that there are an increasing number of cases occurring again this year (2020). Neither this report nor previous ones indicate how many of the reported cases have been laboratory confirmed. Without confirmation, some of these cases may be chickenpox, caused by varicella-zoster virus. There is no additional information about the circumstances under which these cases acquired their infection.

Monkeys are not the reservoirs of the virus, despite the name that the virus has received. Studies of the prevalence of MPX virus in populations of rodent hosts are not mentioned in this or previous reports. The main reservoirs of MPX virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp., an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_. Halting the bushmeat trade and consumption of wild animals to halt MPX virus exposure will be culturally and economically difficult, so continued occurrence of cases can be expected. MPX virus can be transmitted between people but not readily. - Mod.TY
