For the 1st time in some years, cases of typhoid have been reported in
Moscow among permanent residents of the city. Earlier in 2004, typhoid
fever was observed among natives of Central Asia living in Moscow.
In July 2004, Moscow's main state health officer, Nikolay Filatov, reported
that in Moscow in the first half of 2004, 27 cases of disease caused by the
typhoid bacillus were reported, as compared to 12 cases during the same
6-month period in 2003. The majority of cases of typhoid fever in Moscow
were imported from other regions.
