Situation summary in the Americas
---------------------------------
Between epidemiological week (EW) one of 2016 and EW 43 of 2017, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Peru, the Plurinational State of Bolivia, and Suriname have reported suspected and confirmed yellow fever cases.

Since the last yellow fever epidemiological update published by the Pan American Health Organization / World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) on [Wed 2 Aug 2017], Brazil, French Guiana, and Peru reported new yellow fever cases.

In Brazil, since July 2017, São Paulo state has reported 37 suspected yellow fever cases, of which one (fatal case) was confirmed, 3 are under investigation, and 33 were discarded. The confirmed case, which was reported in EW 40 of 2017, is a 76-year-old man who resides in the area between Itatiba and Jundiaí. Figure 1 shows the distribution of confirmed cases since the beginning of the year [2017].

With regard to epizootics, between January and the first half of October 2017, the state of São Paulo reported 1260 epizootics [non-human primate cases], with an increase in reporting from EW 37 of 2017 (Figure 2). Yellow fever was confirmed in 258 non-human primates (NHP), 248 (96 percent) of which were reported in the Campinas region.

There was also an expansion of the yellow fever virus to new areas of São Paulo state, with confirmation for the 1st time of NHP cases in the municipalities of Campo Limpo Paulista (EW 38), Atibaia (EW 39), Jarinu (EW 41) and in the city of São Paulo - urban area (EW 41).1 As a result of these latest findings, the Municipal Health Secretariat together with the government of São Paulo state initiated the vaccination of people living around the area where the epizootic occurred.

The epizootic in the municipality of São Paulo is occurring in a peripheral border area with fragments of forest where the components of the sylvatic virus transmission cycle are present. No human cases have been detected.

In EW 34 of 2017, the National IHR Focal Point for France notified a confirmed case of yellow fever in a 43-year-old Brazilian woman with unknown vaccination status in French Guiana. The patient was hospitalized on [Mon 7 Aug 2017] and died 2 days later at the Cayenne hospital from fulminant hepatitis. She may have visited a gold mining area near St. Elie (North center of the country). Investigations are currently ongoing in order to identify the patient's travel route. This is the 1st confirmed case diagnosed in this territory since 1998.

In Peru, between EW 1 to EW 41 of 2017, a total of 16 confirmed and probable cases of yellow fever were reported, including 3 deaths. Four Similarly to 2016, most cases occurred in the Junín department.

Recommendations
The Pan American Health Organization, Regional Office of the World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) encourages Member States to take the necessary actions to keep travelers informed and vaccinated, when heading to areas where yellow fever vaccination is recommended.

Vaccination
The yellow fever vaccine is safe and affordable and provides effective immunity against the disease in the range of 80 to 100 percent of those vaccinated after 10 days and 99 percent immunity after 30 days. A single dose provides life-long protection against yellow fever disease. A booster dose of yellow fever vaccine is not needed.

Given the limitations on the availability of vaccines and with the aim of promoting the rational use, PAHO / WHO reiterates its recommendations to national authorities:
1. Conduct an assessment of vaccination coverage against yellow fever in areas at risk at the municipal level to guarantee at least 95 percent coverage 5 among the resident population of these areas.
2. Member States that are not currently experiencing outbreaks should not conduct immunization campaign. Priority should be given to the use of vaccines in susceptible populations and to avoid revaccination.
3. Ensure vaccination of all travelers to endemic areas at least 10 days before traveling.
4. Depending on vaccine availabilities, Member States should have a small stock that allows them to respond to outbreaks.
5. Postpone routine vaccination in children in non-endemic areas until sufficient vaccines are available. Once there is availability, catch-up campaigns should be conducted to complete vaccination schedules.

Precautions
It is recommended to individually assess the epidemiological risk of contracting disease when faced with the risk of an adverse event occurring in persons over 60 years who have not been previously vaccinated.
- The vaccine can be offered to individuals with asymptomatic HIV infection with CD4+ counts ≥ 200 cells / mm3 requiring vaccination.
- Pregnant women should be vaccinated in an emergency situation and following recommendations of health authorities.
- Vaccination is recommended in lactating women who live in endemic areas, since the risk of transmitting the vaccine virus to the child is lower than the benefits of the vaccination of breastfeeding women.
- For pregnant or lactating women traveling to areas with yellow fever transmission, vaccination is recommended when travel cannot be postponed or avoided. They should receive advice on the potential benefits and risks of vaccination to make an informed decision. The benefits of breastfeeding are superior to those of other nutritional alternatives.

The following people are usually excluded from yellow fever vaccination:
- Immunocompromised individuals (Including those with thymus disorders, symptomatic HIV, malignant neoplasms under treatment, and those that are receiving or have received immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory treatments, recent transplants, and current or recent radiation therapy).
- People with severe allergies to eggs and their derivatives.

[This summary is a reminder that yellow fever (YF) virus is widely distributed in the tropical areas of South America in the sylvan (forest) transmission cycle onfolving monkeys and forest-dwelling mosquitoes. There is sporadic spill-over to humans in these areas. In Brazil this year [2017] there were a substantial number of human cases and now, an additional case in Sao Paulo state. Fortunately, there have been no _Aedes aegypti_ urban transmission. Although the above report does not mention it, the Sao Paulo municipality has closed several parks to prevent possible spill-over of YF virus to humans. ProMED thanks Greg Folkers for sending in the above report.

ProMED-mail readers may be aware that suspected yellow fever cases were reported in southern India in the popular press. A WHO team sent to the area in India where the supposed YF cases were occurring found no evidence of YF and suggested that the cases were dengue HF. - Mod.TY
