UNDIAGNOSED DEATHS, TASMANIAN DEVILS - AUSTRALIA (05)

Although TVT [transmissible venereal tumor of dogs] is self-curing in more
than 90 percent of cases, it can, in odd cases, be very difficult to treat
and even, on occasion, metastasize. This course of the disease is thought
to be due to poor immunity in the patient.
The tumor is very sensitive to irradiation. I wonder whether they have
tried that with these Tasmanian Devils?
During my stay in Belize, I have seen quite a number of TVT cases there.

[TVT, to which Dr. Brown refers, is a neoplasm in dogs which has been shown
to be transmissible.
Similarities and differences between TVT and DFTD (Tasmanian Devil Facial
Tumour Disease) have been discussed in posting 20030814.2026.
DFTD is being investigated by a professional Australian team; their
Progress Report of January 2005 was discussed in posting 20050122.0233. The
update of April 2005 can be accessed at
