Minister of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality (LNV), Verburg,
announced that [the animals] in the large sheep and goat dairy farms
will be vaccinated against Q-fever, starting Monday 20 Oct 2008.
Vaccine for other farms and holdings will become available on 3 Nov
2008, but in view of the limited availability of the vaccine, it will
also be available only within 45 km (28 mi) around the outbreak in
Uden, where most human cases have occurred as well.

There are 80 000 doses of vaccine available. As each animal must be
vaccinated twice, a total of 40 000 animals can be vaccinated.

The number of Q-fever cases detected in humans in Brabant during 2008
exceeds any previously known figures. Most of these infections were
subclinical or expressed mild flu symptoms, but infections have also
led to pneumonia, sometimes requiring hospitalization. The minister
has opted for a vaccination program [of animals] to prevent human Q
fever infection. She does this in addition to the measures already
taken [regarding animals], namely mandatory disease reporting, manure
handling steps, and hygiene-related advice.

Due to the limited availability of the vaccine and in order to obtain
a meaningful evaluation of the vaccination's effect, until 2 Nov 2008
it will be limited to the 45 km radius area, within which it will be
applied in commercial sheep and goat dairy farms with at least 50
animals, and children's farms.

From 3 Nov 2008, other sheep and goat farms will be allowed
vaccination in the vicinity of Uden. For this end, farmers are
advised to contact their veterinarians.

The vaccine is not yet officially registered, but the Bureau of
Animal Health Preparations has studied and approved all safety
aspects related to its field application. On this basis, the Ministry
of Agriculture has granted an exemption for the use of this vaccine
until 31 Dec 2008.

The vaccine is provided by the Ministry of Agriculture free of
charge. The costs of application of the vaccines by a veterinarian
are to be borne by the animal owners. The general veterinary
requirements regarding registration, listing, and bookkeeping are
applicable.

The vaccine is distributed, at the request of farmers, by the Food
and Consumer Product Safety Authority (VWA).

[According to OIE's WAHID [World Animal Health Information Database]
interface, the only member-country applying Q fever vaccination in
small ruminants is Israel (26 957 vaccinations in 2007). The vaccine
used in Israel is a commercial, inactivated, bivalent vaccine --
combined with chlamydia.

According to OIE's terrestrial manual, an inactivated phase I vaccine
is commercially available in Slovakia for vaccination of cattle. A
review of Q fever in Slovakia suggests that the decrease in the
occurrence of human and animal Q fever could be the result of the
large-scale vaccination of cattle that was carried out there during
10 years, together with improved veterinary control of domestic
animal transport within the country (Serbezov VS et al (1999): Q
fever in Bulgaria and Slovakia. Emerg. Infect. Dis., 5, 388-394;
abstract available at <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10341175>).

The following English abstract (original paper in Dutch) may serve as
useful background to the Dutch vaccination policy:

Van Steenbergen JE, Morroy G, Groot CA, Ruikes FG, Marcelis JH,
Speelman P (2007): An outbreak of Q fever in The Netherlands
--possible link to goats. Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd; 151(36): 1998-2003.

In 2007, 73 cases of Q fever were identified through reports and
retrospective analyses; the affected region extended from Tilburg in
the southwest to Arnhem in the northeast. The infections arose in
late spring, particularly in May and June. Several spontaneous
abortions due to Q fever occurred on 4 dairy goat farms in the same
region. The national incidence of spontaneous abortion due to Q fever
was 6 cases in 2006 and 7 in 2007. Climatically, this southern region
was extraordinarily dry during April 2007. All pregnant women from a
small region with the highest incidence in northeast North Brabant
were called for diagnostic testing. Infected patients were followed
for symptoms and ultrasound was performed as indicated. A definitive
source of the infection could not yet be identified. Favourable
climatic conditions were suspected as the cause for the combination
of widespread dissemination among goats and transmission to humans.
----
Q fever should be considered in patients in The Netherlands who
present with lower airway infection and, in rare cases, hepatitis.
Reporting atypical clusters of pneumonia to the Municipal Health
Service (GGD) is advisable. The GGD maintains close contact with
Animal Health Services, which is aware of current infectious animal
diseases. Targeted investigation can identify the source of infection
and eliminate it. Greater awareness can prevent delays in diagnosis
and treatment and help identify chronic forms at an early stage or
prevent them. - Mod.AS]
