[1] Bat rabies, Switzerland, human exposure
Date: Wed 2 Aug 2017
From: Redto zanoni <zanoni@vetsuisse.unibe.ch> [edited]


Today, [Wed 2 Aug 2017], a serotine bat (_Eptesicus serotinus_, the major reservoir species of bat rabies in Europe) was diagnosed as rabies positive in FAT [fluorescent antibody test] at the Swiss Rabies Center. Confirmation in RTCIT [rabies tissue culture infection test], real-time RT-PCR and RT-PCR for partial sequencing of the N portion of the genome are under way. This bat, which was in a moribund state, fell to the feet of a person in broad daylight. Unfortunately, the person handled the bat and was bitten in the index finger when trying to liberate it in the evening of the same day. Active and passive post exposure prophylaxis, which was initiated the same day, is under way.

This is the 1st reoccurrence of bat rabies diagnosis in Switzerland since 2002 and presumably the 1st diagnosis of EBLV-1 in Switzerland. So far, out of 941 bats tested in the frame of passive surveillance since 1976, only 3 bats, all of the species _Myotis daubentoni_, were found positive in 1992, 1993 and 2002, respectively. Out of all bats tested, only 29 were serotine bats, indicating its rare interference with human settlements. Still this case reaffirms the public recommendation to handle bats with utmost caution, if any.

[Following the eradication of rabies from West and Central Europe's red fox population, rabies remains a residual risk to public health due to the natural circulation of bat-specific viruses, such as European bat lyssaviruses (EBLVs). European bat lyssavirus types 1 and 2 (EBLV-1 and EBLV-2) are widely distributed throughout Europe, but little is known of their true prevalence and epidemiology.

Notably, Switzerland was the 1st country to apply oral vaccination in wildlife for the control and eventually eradication of rabies. The successful campaign started in 1978 in the canton of Valais. Switzerland was followed by other European countries, and elsewhere.

Switzerland's most recent rabies case in a domestic animal, as reported to the OIE, took place in 2003 (a dog, "most probably illegally imported, coming from a North-African country"). Its most recent case in wildlife was reported in September 2002 (bat, _Myotis daubentoni_). - Mod.AS

[2] Human rabies, China, Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, vaccine failure suspected

Authorities in the north western city of Xi'an will overhaul the rabies vaccine industry following reports that a local woman died after being bitten by a dog despite receiving the vaccination. The victim died 28 days after being bitten by a dog on [Tue 20 Jun 2017] according to Hongxing News. The woman had received 4 rabies shots in a hospital in Xi'an, capital of Shaanxi Province, the report said.

The story fueled a public outcry, with an online post about it attracting nearly 5000 comments on Sina Weibo, a Twitter-like service. Many questioned the quality of the rabies vaccine. Authorities with Xi'an Food and Drug Administration said they would investigate the storage, transportation and use of rabies vaccines in the city. An investigation will also be conducted at outpatient services handling exposure to rabies.

Any organizations or individuals found illegally storing and transporting vaccines will face "a severe crackdown", according to the administration.

A scandal broke in 2016 in which millions of dollars of improperly stored or expired vaccines were sold to patients nationwide. A total of 125 people were arrested and 37 officials put under investigation for negligence and graft. Following the scandal, the country carried out a series of measures to fix loopholes in the distribution of vaccines, including banning drug wholesalers from selling vaccines and reforming distribution channels for the country's non-compulsory vaccines.

Rabies is a class 2 notifiable disease in China. As dogs have become popular as pets in China, cases of rabies have been on the increase. In 2006, at least 16 people died of rabies in eastern China's Shandong Province after several dog attacks.

[A previous case of suspected vaccine failure in a human in China was reported by ProMED-mail in 20050718.2071; there may have been others.

China is a high-risk environment for rabies, with human rabies cases 2nd only to India globally. In 2014, nearly 1000 rabies related deaths were reported. Rabies geographic distribution has expanded for the recent years, according to a 2016 review paper (ref 1), covering 55 years of rabies epidemiology in mainland China, and detailed analysis of data in recent years. The authors state that rabies still remains a serious public health problem in China, the east and south regions more seriously affected compared with other regions. Males in rural areas had higher risk of infection than residents in urban areas, a clear seasonal pattern has been observed with a peak in August.
