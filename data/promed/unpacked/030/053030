Abstract
Feline trichomoniasis is an intestinal disease in cats resulting in chronic diarrhea, flatulence, tenesmus [a feeling of constantly needing to pass stools despite an empty colon], and fecal incontinence. Bovine trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted disease of cattle infecting the reproductive tract of cows causing pyometra [uterine infection] and possible mid- to late-term abortions. The causative agent for both diseases has been reported to be the flagellated protozoan, _Tritrichomonas foetus_. However, several published reports support significant biological differences between _T. foetus_ isolated from bovines and felines. In the present study, we describe _Tritrichomonas blagburni_ n.sp. from the domestic cat (_Felis catus_) as the causative agent of feline intestinal trichomoniasis. We support our proposal based on results of experimental cross-infection studies between cats and cattle using both feline and bovine isolates of the parasite, differences in pathogenicity between the 2 parasites for the respective host species, and molecular gene sequencing differences between parasites obtained from domestic cats and parasites obtained from cattle.

Logically, this Tritrichomonas species, if it has a specific domestic niche in house cats or even farm cats, would make one suspicious that it may have the capacity to cross infect humans and present a zoonotic threat, and, may one add, of the possible ability of humans to walk it over from one household into cats in another. Though newly described, this feline species has certainly been with us for many years. - Mod.MHJ]

[I think that the importance of the finding is that it will improve epidemiological studies where genotyping from different species will show if cross contamination exist. The dogma in humans is that there are no animal reservoir, but that may change. Indeed, thrimoniasis in humans could very well be shown to be a zoonosis. - Mod.EP
