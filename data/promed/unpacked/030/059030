New York City
------------------
In New York, a 61-year-old hospital worker was struggling for
survival after testing positive for inhalation anthrax, the city
health commissioner said today. The source of the infection is not
known. Environmental samples from the hospital have come back
negative, and no one else is showing signs of the disease, Mayor
Rudolph W. Giuliani said. Dr. Steven Ostroff of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention said the case was troubling because it
is the first in New York involving the inhalation form of the disease.
Unlike all New York's other anthrax cases. There's no clear linkage
with the mail, he said.
Mr. Giuliani said the woman worked in a supply room at the Manhattan
Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital on Manhattan's East Side. The room shared
space with or was very close to the hospital mailroom, he said, but
there was no evidence she handled mail and no indication of a letter
as the source of the anthrax. The woman was hospitalized on Sunday,
and tests confirmed the nature of her illness today.
[Her condition has been confirmed as inhalation anthrax following
thorough laboratory & clinical examinations, after anthrax was
suspected by a sharp-eyed infectious disease physician. She has been
on levoquin, rifampin and clindamycin since admission. Admission chest
X-ray had characteristic mediastinal adenopathy in addition to other
findings. Subsequent events may demonstrate whether this new
inhalation case is of a new series or an unfortunate indirect contact
with a known contaminated site. - Mods.MHJ/JW]
[Officials are interviewing all patients who visited the Manhattan
Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital, at 210 East 64th Street, since 11 Oct
2001, 2 weeks before the woman first experienced symptoms.]
Washington DC
-------------------
Traces of Anthrax Are Found at 2 More D.C. Area Post Offices
----------------------------------------------------------------------
------
Traces of anthrax have been found in 2 more post offices in the
Washington area, but no new incidents of disease have turned up in or
near the capital, officials said today.
The new findings in the Washington area were at the Friendship station
on Wisconsin Avenue in Northwest Washington and at a station in
Dulles, Virginia, Deputy Postmaster General John Nolan said. He said
the places, found on Monday night, were extremely localized and were
being cleaned up.
So far, the only known source of contamination in Washington is a
letter that was sent to the office of Senator Tom Daschle of South
Dakota, the Democratic majority leader. That letter, which passed
through the Brentwood Road center, exposed about 30 people on Capitol
Hill to anthrax, contaminated several office buildings and hampered
Senate and House business for many days.
At the news briefing today, Mr. Ridge and Mr. Nolan offered a reminder
that some 25 billion pieces of mail have circulated in the United
States since the first anthrax incidents were reported, meaning that
the odds of anyone getting infected from the mail are astronomical.

Washington DC
-------------------
Tests of White House mail facilities and personnel are finished, and
they show no signs of anthrax contamination, White House spokesman Ari
Fleischer said Tuesday.
Senate leaders agreed Tuesday to accept Environmental Protection
Agency recommendations to fumigate the Hart Senate Office Building
with chlorine dioxide gas to kill any anthrax spores that may remain
inside. An anthrax-tainted letter was delivered to the office of
Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, D-South Dakota. Other federal
agencies also must approve the plan.
Florida
---------
Anthrax spores have been discovered on a feeder belt in the main US
Postal Service processing facility in Palm Beach County, Florida.
Postal Service spokesman Joe Breckenridge said the small amount of
spores collected posed no danger to postal workers and there was no
plan to shut down the facility.
