Health authorities are urging city dwellers, office workers and visitors to
be alert to the signs and symptoms of Legionnaire's Disease following two
cases with links to an Exhibition Street office building. Victoria's Chief
Health Officer, Dr Graham Rouch, said a further three cases of
Legionnaire's Disease which may also be linked to this area are still being
investigated.
Three of the five who fell ill - two men and a woman - are being treated in
hospital. The other two men had been treated and discharged. Dr Rouch said
two of those hospitalised worked at 222 Exhibition Street - one for the
Transport Accident Commission and the other at the Victorian Workcover
Authority. These staff and other tenants in the building have been given
information about the signs and symptoms of Legionnaire's Disease.
"One of these cases was diagnosed as a result of workplace surveillance
where employees with a history of recent respiratory illness were advised
to consult their doctors and inform them of the possibility of
Legionnaire's disease.

Samples taken from the cooling towers of a building in Exhibition Street,
Melbourne have tested positive for legionnaires' disease, a spokesman for
the Department of Human Services said today.
Water from one of the towers at 222 Exhibition Street confirmed bacteria
that causes the disease was present at a high level, he said. Department
officials took the samples after five people - three office workers and two
visitors to the building - were hospitalised with the disease last week.
The spokesman said all towers had been disinfected and now posed no risk to
workers, including employees of the Victorian Workcover Authority and
Transport Accident Commission, or visitors.
But he remained cautious about the meaning of the test results. "What we do
when we take a sample is immediately disinfect it (the cooling tower) and
that should render the tower safe in terms of any build-up of bacteria ...
but we can't say that a positive test in one tower establishes any causal
link for the illness in these five people."
He said the department was still looking at other possibilities, but people
in the city should monitor their health as the illness may incubate for up
to 10 days before the symptoms start.
"People have been informed about what the signs and symptoms of the disease
are, so that if they feel ill they can take action." The disease, usually
transmitted via spray drift from air- conditioning towers, causes flu-like
symptoms and can be fatal in some cases.
