Cattle farmers in the province of Chiriqui are on alert, after an outbreak
of bovine brucellosis on a property located in the community of
Potrerillos, in the district of Dolega.
According to government sources, 60 animals were found positive for
_Brucella abortus_. 27 of the animals have been destroyed at Matadero
Chiriqui, S.A, located in the city of David.
Virgilio Vergara, president of the local branch of the National Association
of Ganaderos (ANAGAN), stated that the situation is a clear risk for the
cattle of Chiriqui, which have been free of the disease for the past
several years. This is a worrying situation, because (_B. abortus_) is a
transmissible disease to humans that can spread to other animals, and,
generate serious problems in this area, Vergara said.
Jose Dimas Espinoza, president of the Association of Veterinary Doctors of
Panama (AMVP), shares Vergara's concern. Espinoza said that, when an
outbreak of this disease is detected, the animal is marked for slaughter
with the letter "B," and the farm is put under quarantine.

[Animal caretakers, including veterinarians, are especially susceptible to
brucellosis from infected animals. Generally, when the animal requires
assistance during the birthing process, the person providing the assistance
is most at risk of exposure to the causative bacterium _Brucella abortus_.
This agent can be passed to humans through un-pasteurized or raw milk as well.
Brucellosis is commonly transmitted to susceptible animals by direct
contact with infected animals, or, with an environment that has been
contaminated with discharges from infected animals. Aborted fetuses,
placental membranes or fluids, and other vaginal discharges present after
an infected animal has aborted or calved are all highly contaminated with
infectious brucella organisms.
Cattle, bison, and cervids are susceptible to _B. abortus_. Other
_Brucella_ species affect other animals. The animals experience a loss of
production (including abortion of the fetus), a drop in milk production,
weight loss, infertility, and lameness. Although the animal may abort the
1st fetus, the animal may successfully carry a fetus to term during the
next pregnancy. Offspring may be born weak or dead, without actual
abortion. - Mod.TG]
