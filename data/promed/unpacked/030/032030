Results from this year's [2007] UK Cereal Pathogen Virulence [UKCPV]
Survey suggest that a new race of brown rust is present on winter
wheat crops in the UK.
According to HGCA [Home Grown Cereals Association - Mod.DHA]
Recommended Lists manager, Jim McVittie, samples of wheat from
previously resistant varieties -- Robigus, Hyperion, Oakley, and
Timber -- were infected with brown rust. "Clearly, further work is
required to confirm that these races can re-infect the varieties they
were collected on, but the relatively large number of samples from
Robigus does suggest the presence of a new race in the UK and
seedling tests have confirmed that they can re-infect the variety," he said.
According to NIAB [National Institute of Agricultural Botany -
Mod.DHA] plant pathologist, Dr Rosemary Bayles, this season's early
infections of both brown and yellow rust had caused concern among
growers and agronomists. "Growers have been concerned to see brown
rust in equal quantities to yellow rust," she said.
Varietal resistance profiles to rusts may change as adult plant
resistance kicks in at growth stage 31/32, and in some instances
resistance may be affected by temperature, said Dr Bayles. "While
there will be a whole package of races of brown rust affecting crops,
I'm sure there's going to be quite a lot of this Robigus race around."
The collection of brown rust from newly-recommended variety Timber,
currently rated 9 for resistance to the disease, and Hyperion, also
rated 9, was a "warning flag", she added.
Yellow rust virulence frequencies on wheat in 2006 were similar to
the previous year [2005], with virulence for Robigus continuing to be
common. One yellow rust race collected in 2005 appears to combine
virulence for Robigus with that for varieties such as Access, Mascot,
and Napier. This race also appears to be virulent on Timber, but not Einstein.
The virulence on Timber, which has a specific recommendation for good
disease resistance, could affect its Recommended List rating for
resistance to yellow rust. The failure of the virulence to affect
Einstein suggests that that variety carries an additional, currently
unidentified, resistance factor.
Samples collected from Robigus confirmed the presence of races of
mildew that can infect the variety. These races are now being found
in Recommended Lists trials and the rating of the variety has been
revised to 7.
According to Dr Bayles, mildew is not proving to be a major problem
on Robigus in the field. The 'Robigus race' was also being detected
in samples collected from other varieties, which was a sign that it
was spreading more widely through the overall mildew population.
Eight mildew samples were also collected from Timber, suggesting a
new race on that variety. However, the race has yet to be detected in
Recommended Lists trials.
The UKCPV celebrates 40 years of existence this year [2007]. A new
5-year contract will see all trials carried out by NIAB in Cambridge.

[Leaf rust, also called brown rust, on wheat is caused by the fungus
_Puccinia triticina_ (formerly _P. recondita_ f. sp. _tritici_);
stripe (yellow) rust is caused by _P. striiformis_; wheat (powdery)
mildew is caused by _Blumeria_ (synonym: _Erisyphe_) _graminis_ f.
sp. _tritici_.
Multiple genes of both host and pathogen species contribute to
disease expression and thus, there are potentially many mutations
that could affect this interaction. The situation becomes even more
complex when dealing with multiple resistance factors directed at
different pathogens, which may or may not interact with each other.
Different levels of resistance can be observed in certain
combinations of host/pathogen variants and are rated according to the
severity of symptoms induced in the host.
New races of fungal plant pathogens with changes in virulence are
emerging frequently in resistant host varieties since these host
populations present a situation of increased selection pressure for
the pathogen. A very serious example is the new strain Ug99 of wheat
black stem rust (_Puccinia graminis_).
