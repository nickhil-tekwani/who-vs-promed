Thailand: 2nd human case of avian influenza virus confirmed
-----------------------------------------------
A 32-year-old Thai woman was today [Mon 27 Sep 2004] confirmed to be
suffering from bird flu, the 2nd confirmed human case of the disease since
the country's latest outbreak began in July 2004. The woman was confirmed
to have the H5N1 subtype virus, but her condition was improving, Charal
Trinwuthipong, Director-general of the Disease Control Department, said. A
diagnostic test on the woman, conducted on Fri 24 Sep 2004, had turned out
negative. A 2nd test gave a positive result, Charal said. Although she is
believed to have come into contact with chickens, authorities are still
investigating the possibility that she got the disease through
human-to-human transmission. The woman's sister, aged 26, died on 20 Sep
2004 in a hospital near Bangkok. She is not known to have come into contact
with chickens or birds, but she had spent about a week in close contact
with her 11-year-old daughter until the girl's death in a hospital, on 12
Sep 2004, in the northern Kamphaengphet province. The girl also had bird
flu-like symptoms, but no tests could be done on her, because she had
already been cremated by the time officials were alerted.
Health experts are worried about the possibility of the avian virus
combining with a human influenza virus to create a more deadly version that
could easily be spread among people, giving rise to a possible global
pandemic. A bird flu outbreak in Hong Kong in 1997 killed 6 people and
resulted in limited human-to-human transmission. Those who got the disease
from other people experienced only minor symptoms, and there was no
evidence that the virus had mutated into a highly dangerous form.
9 people have died as a result of infection with avian influenza A (H5N1)
virus in Thailand -- including an 18-year-old man last month [August 2004]
-- in the latest round of the disease that began in July 2004. 8 other
people died earlier in the year. The disease also has killed 19 people in
Viet Nam, and tens of millions of chickens, and other birds, have died or
been culled throughout much of Asia.

Thailand alerted over 2nd infection case in revived bird flu outbreak
-----------------------
The Thai government on Monday announced that a woman has been confirmed of
bird flu infection, a 2nd patient of the epidemic since the second wave of
avian influenza hit the kingdoms three months ago. Though confirmed of
being infected with the virus, the 36-year-old woman was recovering from
the disease, the Thai Health Minister Sudarat Keyuraphan told reporters.
The woman's 26-year-old sister and 11-year-old niece have died a couple of
days ago with pneumonia symptoms. The mother and daughter's death have yet
to be confirmed as bird flu infection.
[The above confirmed case] and her deceased niece have reportedly disposed
carcasses of birds dying of bird flu earlier around her home in the
province of Kamphaengphet, lying some 380 kilometers northeast of Bangkok.
However, her deceased sister, who had no record of touching infected birds,
had fallen sick after coming back from Bangkok and briefly taking care of
her sick daughter. The death of [this current case's] sister on last Monday
thus created great concerns of the possibility of transmission of bird flu
virus among human.
Health officials around the country are holding a meeting on Monday to
discuss ways to prevent further spread of the epidemic. All hospitals are
required to closely monitor patients with fever symptoms and some 20 000
health volunteers are organized to report abnormal death of fowls and
educate people of basic information of the poultry epidemic.
Meanwhile, the authorities played down the possibility of bird flu being
transmitted between humans. The acting health permanent secretary Charal
Trinvudhipong, noted that the possibility of human transmission was only
assumption and the authorities were still waiting for the lab test result,
which might take as long as one week.
The other death of the other 13-year-old boy in the same province was also
[pending confirmation] whether caused by infection [with avian influenza].
[The current confirmed case] was the second [person] infected with bird flu
virus since the epidemic revived in Thailand in early July [2004].
A 18-year-old young man died of the disease in August [2004], which put the
kingdom's bird flu casualty to 9. In the first wave of avian influenza
outbreak in the first 3 months of this year [2004], 8 people in Thailand
died of the disease. Another 19 people have died in Vietnam, bringing the
Asian death toll to 28.
Besides, there have been 128 patients in Thailand under observation for
possible infection of the disease since early July. Now, 114 of the cases
have been cleared and the rest are still waiting for the test result.
Besides, the fowl epidemic also created economic damage to Thailand, the
world 4th largest exporter of poultry products. Experts of the industry
estimated that at least 30 million birds have been culled or died of the
epidemic. Currently, there are 30 provinces of Thailand's 76 provinces
reporting outbreak of bird flu.

[This is the 1st confirmation of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection
in the family group in which person-to-person transmission of infection was
suspected. Unfortunately, the body of the young girl, who was the index
case, has been cremated. It is unclear from this report whether her
deceased mother has been confirmed as a case of avian influenza virus
infection. - Mod.CP]
