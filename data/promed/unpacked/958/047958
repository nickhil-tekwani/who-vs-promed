The Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported on 18 May 2018 that the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS) confirmed equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM) in one horse at a sport horse farm in Fauquier County on 16 May 2018.

Equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy is the neurological form of equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1).

"The horse 1st showed mild neurologic signs on 10 May 2018 and was admitted directly into isolation at the Marion DuPont Scott Equine Medical Center (in Leesburg, Virginia) on 16 May 2018 the EDCC said. "The Equine Medical Center is not under quarantine and is operating normally.

"The farm in Fauquier County is under quarantine, and all exposed horses are being monitored twice daily for fever (temperature over 101.50 F [38.6 C]) and other clinical signs," the EDCC added. "The horse had not travelled off the farm prior to exhibiting clinical signs."

Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and EHM. In many horses, the only sign of EHV-1 infection is fever, which can go undetected.

In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months) but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with the neurological form usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurological signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore- and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

A 2nd case of a neurological disease in horses has surfaced in North Dakota.

The Bismarck Tribune reports a horse in Stutsman County was euthanized last weekend after contracting the form of equine herpes called EHM.

The disease last month [April 2018] claimed an acclaimed barrel racing horse in Bowman County. The presence of the disease has forced the cancellation of several rodeos in North Dakota, including the Dickinson State University Blue Hawk Stampede Rodeo this weekend.
