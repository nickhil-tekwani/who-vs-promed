A veterinarian from the Provincial Veterinary Service who practices in the western half of New Brunswick, Canada, was called on 5 Nov 2018 to see a horse that was off feed and presenting with swelling of the right parotid area. The horse was cultured positive for _Streptococcus equi equi_ (strangles) 4 days later. This horse was euthanized for other health reasons.

The premises were put under quarantine on 5 Nov 2018 because strangles was suspected with the clinical signs. In all, 3 other horses on the farm were exposed to the positive case. One horse (a pony) showed clinical signs 8 days later and was cultured positive. The 2 remaining horses on the farm did not show clinical signs but were also sampled and one horse cultured positive.

As of 14 Dec 2018, the 2 horses have not shown clinical signs and the pony has made a full recovery. The premises continue to be under quarantine, and serial nasal swabs are planned before the quarantine is lifted.

[It is very sad this preventable disease pushed a horse over the health threshold, adding to its existing problems to result in euthanasia -- especially because this disease has several types of vaccines to prevent it. However, it is good to know the others are recovering.

Strangles is a contagious infectious disease of Equidae characterized by abscessation of the lymphoid tissue of the upper respiratory tract. The causative organism, _Streptococcus equi equi_, is highly host-adapted and produces clinical disease only in horses, donkeys, and mules. It is a gram-positive, capsulated B-hemolytic Lancefield group C coccus, which is an obligate parasite and a primary pathogen.

The incubation period of strangles is 3-14 days, and the 1st sign of infection is fever (103-106 deg F [39.4-41.1 deg C]). Within 24-48 hours of the initial fever spike, the horse will exhibit signs typical of strangles, including mucoid to mucopurulent nasal discharge, depression, and submandibular lymphadenopathy. Horses with retropharyngeal lymph node involvement have difficulty swallowing, inspiratory respiratory noise (compression of the dorsal pharyngeal wall), and extended head and neck. Older animals with residual immunity may develop an atypical or catarrhal form of the disease with mucoid nasal discharge, cough, and mild fever. Metastatic strangles ("bastard strangles") is characterized by abscessation in other lymph nodes of the body, particularly the lymph nodes in the abdomen and, less frequently, the thorax. _S. equi_ is the most common cause of brain abscess in horses, albeit rare.

Most horses continue to shed _S. equi_ for around one month after recovery. A total of 3 negative nasopharyngeal swabs at intervals of 4-7 days should be obtained before release from quarantine, and the minimal isolation period should be one month. Prolonged bacterial shedding (as long as 18 months) has been identified in a small number of horses. Guttural pouch empyema is the source of infection in most prolonged carrier states. Bacterial culture of nasopharyngeal swab and/or guttural pouch lavage is used to identify persistent carriers.

Post-exposure immunity is prolonged after natural disease in most horses, and protection is associated with local (nasal mucosa) production of antibody against the antiphagocytic M protein. The clinical attack rate of strangles is reduced by 50% in horses vaccinated with IM products that do not induce mucosal immunity. Local (mucosal) production of antibody requires mucosal antigen stimulation. An intranasal vaccine containing a live attenuated strain of _S. equi equi_ was designed to elicit a mucosal immunologic response. This attenuated strain is not temperature sensitive (inactivated by core body temperature) like the intranasal influenza vaccine. Reported complications include _S. equi equi_ abscesses at subsequent IM injection sites (live bacteria on hands of administrator), submandibular lymphadenopathy, serous nasal discharge, and purpura hemorrhagica.
