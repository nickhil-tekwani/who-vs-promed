A comment on vaccination policy
-------------------------------
The price of vaccines is a significant issue, but I remain
unconvinced that it is as big an issue as it is often portrayed.

It is frequently the case that the cost of delivering the vaccine to
the targets effectively far outweighs the cost of the vaccine,
including the logistics of cold chain, losses due to expiry of unused
stocks and, especially, administration of the vaccine to the targets.

In the case of rabies, this, I believe, is the major reason why the
most effective control measure -- vaccination of reservoir host-vector
populations (dogs in the case of Cambodia and most of South and South
East Asia) is often not undertaken and primary response measures
frequently rely on human dog bite victims presenting themselves to a
major regional health care institution which has the infrastructure to
store vaccines, may have PE [post-exposure] vaccine in stock and,
then, may administer it (at an affordable cost).

Put simply, it is logistically very difficult and expensive to
vaccinate the dog population effectively, especially if it is a
loosely-controlled and free-ranging population, irrespective of the
cost of vaccines, and veterinary services in developing countries
often aren't adequately funded to deliver proactive preventative
interventions for zoonoses even when they are technically and
otherwise potentially capable of doing that.

That aside, people don't always present to hospitals for PE treatment
after dog bites, even when they know that they should and appreciate
the risks if they do not (which certainly isn't always the case even
in developing countries) -- underlying the importance of public
awareness and communications with regard to such diseases.

[ProMED-mail thanks David Thomson for this thoughtful assessment. In
the Indonesian island of Bali an attempt is under way to control and
eradicate human rabies by an island wide programme of vaccination of
the domestic and feral dog population (see ProMED-mail: Rabies -
Indonesia (09): (Bali) 20110404.1043). It will be instructive to
observe how well this aim can be achieved, and at what cost. - Mod.CP]
