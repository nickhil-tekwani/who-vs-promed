The information reported by ProMED-mail [Cholera, Diarrhea and Dysentery Update (05): Africa, Asia; archive no 20140129.2235497], on the outbreak of diarrheal disease in the Limpopo Province of South Africa requires modification. The information was reported from a media source and the conclusions of the moderator are not correct.

There have been 44 cases of diarrheal disease all linked to the attendance of an event at a lodge. Of these cases, all were treated in hospital but only 9 were admitted over the course of 7 days and have recovered. There have been no deaths. Patients presented at the local hospital with diarrhea and vomiting within 48 hours of first checking into the lodge and enjoying several meals (checked in on 20 Jan 2014 and 1st case presented on 22 Jan 2014.) A non-typhoidal _Salmonella_ species was confirmed by laboratory tests on stool specimens from the patients, and will be further characterized. The outbreak is currently under investigation but preliminary reports would point to a foodborne illness directly related to food consumed by attendees of the event at the lodge. No further cases have been reported since 28 Jan 2014 and all reported cases were discharged in good health.

There is no evidence whatsoever -- clinically or on laboratory testing --to suggest cholera. The last outbreak of cholera in the Limpopo province was between November 2008 and June 2009. Last year [2013] there were only 2 cases of imported cholera reported in Limpopo. There have been no local outbreaks since 2009.
