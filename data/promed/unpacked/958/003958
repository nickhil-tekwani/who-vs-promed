The Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF) wishes to alert the
international community to the rapidly spreading outbreak of cholera
in the Ogaden. This outbreak has already resulted in the deaths of
dozens of people in eastern Ogaden with over 40 victims in the city
of Qabri Dahare alone.
The ONLF wishes to make clear that all aid agencies are welcome in
Ogaden and encouraged to come to the immediate aid of the victims of
this cholera outbreak.

The outbreak of cholera in the Nyagatare District has so far claimed
12 [lives] with about 400 suspected to be infected, The New Times has
learned. Among the areas reportedly most affected are the Nyagatare
main prison in Nyagatare Town, and sectors of Rukomo, Tabagwe, and Karama.
The health officials in Nyagatare hospital said that the number of
cholera victims is increasingly outweighing the capacity of the
hospital and called for immediate attention from other health service
providers and development agencies.
The District Director of Health services, Justin Rwagasore, when
contacted last week, acknowledged the outbreak of cholera in the area
and admitted that over 180 people in the hospital have symptoms of the disease.
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), in conjunction
with Red Cross Rwanda has intervened to help the cholera victims.
According to Dr. Luc from the ICRC, and an expert in the fight
against epidemics including cholera, a technical team has already
arrived in the district to assess the situation in the affected area
and explore avenues of intervention.
Rwagasore said, "The situation is worsening since the epidemic has
reached the crowded Nyagatare prison and over 47 people have been
reported infected with cholera. But the ICRC has come to intervene
and the local leaders in the district are pledging to give more
support to deal with the issue."

[3] Cholera - Somalia (Middle Shabelle, Lower Shabelle)

At least 30 children have died of watery diarrhea in settlements
around Jawhar 90 km (55 miles) north of the capital Mogadishu, the
main town of Middle Shabelle province, southern Somalia. Reports from
Jawhar indicate that in this week alone 30 children under the age of
5 have died of the diarrhea-related disease.
Dr. Abdullahi Hussein Moalim, the director of Jawhar hospital, told
Shabelle Media Network on Thu 8 Feb 2007, that many more children
were gravely ill of the disease, calling on the international relief
agencies to bring medical supplies into the area immediately. More
than 350 cholera patients have been placed in the Inter-SOS hospital
in Jawhar in the past weeks.
Doctors in Middle and Lower Shabelle provinces say the number of
watery diarrhea-related deaths is increasing as people are forced to
use contaminated water from flood swamps and the river. More than 50
children are believed to have died in Middle Shabelle province alone
in the past 2 weeks, doctors say.

[4] Cholera - Somalia

A cholera outbreak in Somalia has killed more than 115 people and
hospitalized 724 in towns where people were forced to use
contaminated water from a flooded river, doctors said Wed 7 Feb 2007.
Tests conducted by the international group Doctors Without Borders
confirmed the cholera outbreak in towns along the Shabelle River. The
river flooded this year [2007], leaving tens of thousands homeless in
a country with little ability to respond because it in effect lacks a
government.
"At least 115 people, 53 of them children, have died from cholera in
4 districts in the last 4 weeks," said Dr. Abdulahi Hussein Malin,
who works in a hospital in Jawhar. Infants have been especially
affected, said Dr. Hawo Abdi Mumin, who works with the Somalian Red
Crescent Society.
"People use water from the river, which is contaminated because of
the floods, because they have no access to clean water."
