Since Tue 14 Apr 2020, the Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) has received 2 new confirmed cases of rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 2 (RHDV2) in domestic rabbits in El Paso County. To date, there have been 3 confirmed cases of RHDV2 in domestic Texas rabbits.

The 1st case of RHDV2 in Texas was found in domestic rabbits on a Hockley County premises on 10 Apr 2020. Since then, RHD was confirmed by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) in a wild black-tailed jackrabbit in Lubbock County and a wild cottontail rabbit in Hudspeth County. To learn more about the wild rabbit confirmations, visit the TPWD website at https://tpwd.texas.gov/newsmedia/releases/?req=20200421a.

"The Commission would like to urge all rabbit owners and breeders to protect their rabbits from diseases like RHDV2 by increasing biosecurity on their farms and in their homes," said Dr Andy Schwartz, state veterinarian and TAHC executive director. "At this time, biosecurity is the best thing you can do. We are currently researching vaccine options alongside private veterinarians, but because there is no vaccine available in Texas at this time, please work hard to practice cleanliness, isolate your rabbits, and monitor your rabbits' health closely."

RHDV2 is a fatal, viral disease affecting both domestic and wild rabbits, including hares, jackrabbits and cottontails. It does not affect human health or affect other animal species.

The highly contagious foreign animal disease spreads between rabbits through contact with infected rabbits or carcasses, their meat or their fur, contaminated food or water, or materials coming in contact with them. RHDV2 can persist in the environment for a very long time. These factors make disease control efforts extremely challenging once it is in the wild rabbit populations.

The following procedures can reduce the chance of RHDV2 and other contagious diseases from affecting domestic rabbits. For a printable version, click https://www.tahc.texas.gov/news/brochures/TAHCBrochure_BiosecurityRabbit.pdf.

- House rabbits indoors if possible.
- Do not allow pet, feral, or wild rabbits to come in contact with your rabbits or gain entry to the facility or home.
- Always wash your hands with warm, soapy water between pens and before and after entering your rabbit area.
- Keep a closed rabbitry. Do not introduce new rabbits from unknown or untrusted sources.
- If you bring new rabbits into your facility or home, keep them separated from your existing rabbits. Use separate equipment for newly acquired or sick rabbits to avoid spreading disease.
- Control flies, rats, cats, dogs, birds, etc. which can physically move the virus around on their feet or body.
- Do not collect outdoor forage and browse to feed rabbits since it may be contaminated.
- Remove brush, grass, weeds, trash, and debris from the rabbitry to reduce rodents.
- Protect feed from contamination by flies, birds, rodents, etc.
- Remove and properly dispose of dead rabbits (i.e. bury or incinerate) promptly.
- When moving rabbits or restocking pens, disinfect all equipment and cages with 10% bleach mixed with water or other approved products. Properly dispose of bedding. Items made of wood are difficult to disinfect and best discarded.
- Breeders should review their biosecurity plans for gaps, and all rabbit owners should establish a working relationship with a veterinarian to review biosecurity practices for identification and closure of possible gaps.

Rabbit owners who have questions about RHDV2 or observe sudden death in their rabbits should contact their private veterinarian. Private veterinarians are requested to contact the USDA-APHIS or the TAHC to report any suspected cases at 1-800-550-8242. Report all unusual mass morbidity (sickness) or mortality (deaths) events to the TAHC.

"Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) will be monitoring wild rabbit populations to determine the extent of the disease," said Dr Bob Dittmar, TPWD wildlife veterinarian. "We are continuing to receive reports of dead rabbits from the western part of the state.' People can contact their local TPWD wildlife biologist (at the given website) https://tpwd.texas.gov/landwater/land/technical_guidance/biologists/ if they notice sick or dead rabbits. We want to reassure everyone this disease does not affect people or other animals. The TPWD will work with the TAHC to keep the public informed as we learn more about the extent and severity of the disease."
