Nigel Chapman, a Nottinghamshire coroner, said the infection due to
_Clostridium difficile_ (C Diff) had been a contributory factor in 12
deaths in Nottingham hospitals in the past month. He said the rise in
cases due to the organism, which may cause severe diarrhea and can
lead to death in the elderly and vulnerable, could become a national problem.
In November 2006, 3 Nottingham wards were closed over C Diff outbreak
fears. Additionally, C Diff was linked to the deaths of 9 patients at
Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre and a further 3 at the City
Hospital in 4 weeks over November and December 2006.
Dr Chapman stressed C Diff was not the ultimate cause of death in the
majority of cases but said he was worried by the rise in case
numbers. "In 2005, I only had 1 or 2 deaths reported where C Diff was
mentioned. In the last month, I have dealt with more than 12 cases.
If I had to hold inquests into all of these cases, I could not deal with it."
