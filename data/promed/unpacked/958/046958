Recent years have seen transmission grow exponentially among young women, raising the risk of babies acquiring the disease in the womb.

Of all the diseases Dr Rupeena Purewal was watching, syphilis was never at the top of the list. But the Saskatoon pediatric infectious disease doctor says the surging case numbers across Western Canada have suddenly made the disease an emerging issue, particularly for newborn children if their mother is infected during pregnancy. She is now part of a provincial task force of doctors, nurses and public health experts trying get a handle on the disease, which she notes is entirely preventable and treatable but can often go unseen. "It was almost unheard of to see one or 2 cases here and there, and now most of us pediatric infectious disease physicians, we're getting close to three calls a week for presumed congenital syphilis," Purewal said.

Preliminary data from Saskatchewan's Ministry of Health say there were 902 confirmed cases of infectious syphilis [primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis] in 2020, a nearly 10-fold increase from 2018. An estimated 527 cases have already been detected this year [2021], and more may be added as investigations are completed. The province has reported 10 confirmed cases of babies acquiring the disease in the womb, and 2 babies were stillborn as a result of the disease.

The Ministry of Health is now working on a provincial plan to stop the spread, but the problem is not limited to Saskatchewan. Public Health Agency of Canada spokeswoman Anne Genier said in an emailed statement that syphilis has been on the rise across the country since the early 2000s. What has changed is who is getting sick. The rates among females aged 15 to 39 rose by 890 per cent from 2015 to 2019, Genier wrote. "This is of concern since syphilis during pregnancy can lead to adverse outcomes for the fetus, including miscarriage, stillbirth, and infant death," she noted.

Purewal warns that differences in how such cases are classified and reported means clinicians may be seeing more cases than official data suggest. She estimates there were between 30 and 60 cases of congenital syphilis in the province since the start of 2020. "There's a disconnect between the statistics and what we are seeing clinically," she said.

Contraceptives like condoms can limit its spread. In pregnant women, Purewal said treatment can lower the risk of congenital transmission from 100 per cent to between 10 and 0 per cent.

Like all sexually transmitted infections, stigma is often a barrier to people getting tested. So are limited sexual health services in more remote and rural parts of the province. The disease itself is sneaky, sometimes incubating for weeks and months before symptoms appear.

Dr Vanessa Poliquin of the University of Manitoba said syphilis was rare 10 to 15 years ago, particularly in young women. Pregnant women in Manitoba are screened three times during pregnancy, but Poliquin said the tests are not always easy to interpret.

"It's not the most straightforward thing to interpret, and of course many of us went to medical school when syphilis was a thing of the past or we had a low incidence rate," said Poliquin, a specialist in reproductive infectious diseases. She said a system-wide approach -- from prenatal care to education -- is needed. "When it's almost off of people's radar, they let their guard down," she said.

Purewal said Alberta has successfully piloted a strategy of expanding rapid, mobile syphilis testing to help screen more people for the infection and that kind of ramp-up could be helpful in Saskatchewan.

The COVID-19 pandemic has siphoned much of public health's limited resources. Albert Jimmy, who has been the health director at Onion Lake Cree Nation since 1996, said the pandemic diverted mobile testing resources that helped screen for the disease. Underpinning all these challenges are socioeconomic factors, Purewal said. Infectious diseases don't care about a person's income level, but social determinants of health -- homelessness, substance use or inadequate housing -- can all affect access to health care and put people at higher risk. "If you don't have access to health care, you're probably not going to get tested for this infection, and a lot of these infections don't actually present with symptoms like other diseases do," Purewal said.

[In 2019 ProMED reported on an outbreak of primary and secondary syphilis in Saskatchewan that affected in part Indigenous young people and women of child-bearing age in the province -- 43 percent of cases were women compared to just 7 percent in 2017, which created concern for transplacental transmission of syphilis to the fetus during pregnancy and congenital syphilis. An increase in the incidence of syphilis in women in the population is commonly accompanied by increasing rates of congenital syphilis.

Although not mentioned in the news report above, illicit drug use, namely methamphetamine, was cited as a contributing factor to the increase in syphilis cases in 2019 in Saskatchewan, as well as in the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Ontario, and Manitoba. More information on the use of illicit drugs in the current outbreak in Saskatchewan would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

The linkage of methamphetamine use and syphilis transmission is reminiscent of the increase in syphilis among heterosexuals during the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s, when the practice of trading sex with multiple partners for drugs, especially crack cocaine, played a major role in the transmission of syphilis. Under these circumstances, the identities of sex partners are often unknown, which weakens the traditional syphilis-control strategy of partner notification.

Methamphetamine can be swallowed, snorted, smoked, or injected by needle and syringe (https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/methamphetamine). When methamphetamine is injected, transmission of syphilis may occur as a consequence of sharing a needle/syringe contaminated with infected blood from somebody who has primary or secondary syphilis (https://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/archive/newsrel/health/04-28TransmissionSyphilis.asp); but syphilis can also be acquired by direct contact with an infected lesion during oral, vaginal, or anal sex when the drug is taken by any route of administration. Methamphetamine use is associated with sexual behaviors that increase the risk for acquiring syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases, including having multiple sex partners, inconsistent condom use, and exchange of sex for drugs or money (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6806a4.htm). - Mod.ML
