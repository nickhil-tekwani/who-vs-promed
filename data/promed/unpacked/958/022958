HIV important in the outbreak of Leishmaniasis in Wajir?
---------------------------------------------------------
There are conflicting figures of those who have died of Kala-azar in
northern Kenya. Public Health Minister Sam Ongeri put the toll at 11 while
Wajir East MP Mohamed Abdi Mahamud said 30 people had died. In an update on
the situation yesterday, Prof Ongeri said 56 cases had been reported in
Wajir District since the outbreak in March. However, the MP, in a separate
statement, put the figure of those admitted to the district hospital at 72.
Prof Ongeri said the disease - known scientifically as visceral
leishmaniasis - was endemic in Baringo, Turkana, West Pokot, Machakos,
Kitui and Meru, since the 1950s. Transmission had also been reported in
North-Eastern Province, especially in parts of Wajir and Mandera districts.
The disease, whose symptoms include intermittent fever, wasting, anaemia
and enlargement of the spleen, is transmitted by sandflies.
Prof Ongeri added: "Because of the prevailing drought in most parts of the
country, particularly in northern Kenya, there has been a lot of movement
in search of pasture and water. He said a team of Ministry of Health
officials dispatched following the outbreak had confirmed its presence in
Wajir and Mandera. He said: "The ministry would like to reassure people in
the affected areas that adequate drugs have been dispatched to tackle the
outbreak. Arrangements have been made to send more experts to help control
the disease."
The experts, the minister added, would also help treat the patients and map
out strategies to tackle the killer disease.

[One still wonders if HIV co-infection is playing a role in this present
outbreak. Leishmaniasis is one of the infections that are seen in
HIV-infected/AIDS patients and it is well known that the risk of developing
clinical leishmaniasis increases with decreasing CD4 count. The outbreak in
Wajir and indeed in other parts of tropical Africa can very likely be the
result of HIV-infection in the local population. Other infections or
symptoms in HIV-infected can be quite similar - fever, lymphadenopathy,
anemia, progressive emaciation, and weakness, with the hepatosplenomegaly
being attributed to other co-existing etiologies. It is important that the
authorities dealing with the outbreak report on the HIV-status of the
patients as it is possible that the outbreak reflect a stable situation
regarding _Leishmania_ but an increase in HIV-related impaired immunity.
