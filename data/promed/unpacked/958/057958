In early November [2021], Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease killed a retired research technician from the National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and the Environment (Inrae), who had worked at Toulouse in contact with biological tissues infected with prions, reveals the daily Le Monde on [Tue 30 Nov 2021].

In all likelihood, this woman belonged to the Host-Pathogen Interactions (IHAP) research unit. Created in 2003 on the campus of the National Veterinary School of Toulouse (Envt) and attached to the animal health department of INRA, the main objective of this laboratory is "to understand the interactions between pathogenic microorganisms and their hosts".

This death caused great emotion among "her colleagues who worked with her" reports a union source, but also within the scientific community carrying out research on this pathogen responsible for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) or prion diseases.

Another 33-year-old laboratory technician, E.J., died on [17 Jun 2019], from the same incurable neurodegenerative disease. As reported by Le Monde: "The young woman is said to have contracted it in 2010, cutting herself while handling fragments of the brains of mice infected with prions, in another unit of INRAE, in Jouy-en- Josas ". Since then, a judicial investigation has been opened on the conditions of this death and a report was made in [September 2020] on the safety in research laboratories on infectious prions.

The contamination conditions of the INRAE technician in Toulouse are still not known. According to "fragmentary information" collected by several unions, she "cut herself during her work" over a period between 2004 and 2005. Asked about this, INRAE did not respond on this specific point.

"We cannot prove that this event is the cause of his illness, said on condition of anonymity a union. But we ask that all light be shed. We are concerned that there are other contamination. It cannot exclude that she fell ill because of the mad cow. But that 2 technicians working on the prions died 2 years apart, that greatly limits the possibilities. "

Once this "probable Creutzfeldt-Jakob case " became known on [27 Jul 2021], all research and experimentation work relating to prion diseases in France was suspended for 3 months, as a precaution.

"Thus, at the end of July [2021], an internal Inrae survey carried out by prevention advisers and biosafety representatives in this joint laboratory between Inrae and Envt was carried out to gather information on working conditions and possible sources of 'exposure of this retired agent, "said the National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and the Environment in a press release.

At the same time, the ministries responsible for research and agriculture commissioned an inspection mission. Its inspectors moved on November 8 and 9 in Toulouse to the Envt laboratory "for hearings. " It is on the basis of the conclusions of this report that the decision will be taken in a concerted manner between the 5 organizations and in agreement with ministers to decide on the conditions for lifting the moratorium, recently extended by 2 months.

Audits carried out against the opinion of the CHSCT of INRAE which wanted an "external investigation". The report commissioned by the government must be delivered by the end of December [2021]. Depending on its conclusions, the unions of the National Institute research for agriculture, food and the environment do not rule out the possibility of taking legal action.

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease has just killed a person who handled this infectious agent at INRAE in Toulouse. After a first death in 2019, a moratorium on work on this pathogen has been extended.

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease took away, a few days ago, a retired research technician from the National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and the Environment (Inrae), who had worked in Toulouse in contact of biological tissue infected with prions. This death sows consternation and concern in the scientific community working on these infectious agents. It follows the death, on [17 Jun 2019], of E.J., a 33-year-old laboratory technician, suffering from the same incurable neurodegenerative disease. The young woman would have contracted it in 2010, cutting herself during the manipulation of fragments of the brains of mice infected with prions, in another unit of INRAE, in Jouy-en-Josas.

Regarding the retiree from Toulouse, it will be necessary to determine whether she was the victim of a genetic or sporadic form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, if the disease may have been caused by the ingestion of meat contaminated by the agent of encephalopathy bovine spongiform (BSE, also called mad cow disease) or, as in the case of E.J., if accidental occupational exposure can be invoked. Prion diseases are caused by proteins taking an aberrant conformation, which gives them the property of replicating to form aggregates that are deleterious for neurons. There are around 150 cases per year in France, resulting in fatal degeneration of the central nervous system.

[France initiated a national network for epidemiological surveillance of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) in 1991, because of the description of the first cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) linked to treatment by growth hormone of human origin and the observation of cases of cats infected with the agent of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the United Kingdom (UK).

The French surveillance network is integrated into the European network of surveillance since its creation in 1993. As in other countries, sporadic CJD is the most frequent form of TSE in France with an annual mortality rate of 1.44 per million. Since 1996, 27 cases of a variant of CJD (vCJD) have been observed, making France the 2nd country in the world most affected after the UK. No cases of transfusion-associated vCJD have been observed [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23587616/].

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a very rare form of the disease characterized by brain damage that leads to a rapid decrease in movement and loss of mental function. CJD is caused by a protein called a prion. A prion causes normal proteins to fold abnormally. This affects other proteins' ability to function. There are several types. The classic types of CJD are:

- Sporadic CJD makes up most cases. It occurs for no known reason. The average age at which it starts is 65.
- Familial CJD occurs when a person inherits the abnormal prion from a parent (this form of CJD is rare).
- Acquired CJD includes variant CJD (vCJD), the form related to mad cow disease. Iatrogenic CJD is also an acquired form of the disease. Iatrogenic CJD is sometimes passed through a blood product transfusion, transplant, or contaminated surgical instruments.

Variant CJD is caused by eating infected meat. The infection that causes the disease in cows is believed to be the same one that causes vCJD in humans. Variant CJD causes less than 1% of all CJD cases. It tends to affect younger people. Fewer than 200 people worldwide have had this disease.
