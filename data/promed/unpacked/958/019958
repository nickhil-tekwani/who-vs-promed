Thai charged with dove smuggling
--------------------------------
A Thai was charged in the Sessions Court today after he was caught with 120
doves, believed to have been smuggled from Thailand.
State Veterinary Department director Dr Azizol Shahrun said the man, 34,
from Thailand's southern province, was arrested at a police roadblock in
Jertih at 7:30 pm yesterday [11 Jan 2005]. "The birds, packed in boxes,
tested positive to the avian flu virus. The court has given orders to
destroy all the birds," he said.
He said the man has been remanded for a week beginning today pending
hearing of the case.

[Alertness and the ability of the authorities to respond immediately and
efficiently is a prerequisite for the control of infectious animal
diseases. Spreading avian influenza from country to country by smuggling
has been discussed extensively, including previous attempts to smuggle
infected birds from Thailand into Malaysia (see 20040908.2507 and other
references). Declaring that the doves "tested positive to the avian flu
virus" may be an indication that the Malaysian authorities have applied
rapid tests, probably reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR). Details would be helpful.
For information on rapid diagnosis of avian influenza, see the Office
International des Epizooties' Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for
Terrestrial Animals <http://oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/A_00037.htm>. - Mod.AS]
