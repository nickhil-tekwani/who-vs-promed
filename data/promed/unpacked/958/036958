Unusual outbreak of rubella reported in southern Viet Nam
---------------------------------------------------------
Surge in demand empties Viet Nam's vaccine stocks. Many rubella-related abortions could have been avoided with better diagnosis according to physicians. Viet Nam mulls over major rubella vaccination plan.

Viet Nam's health authorities said nearly 30 people have tested positive for rubella, warning that there may be many more showing symptoms of the contagious disease. The outbreak was 1st recorded early this month [January 2015] at a US-invested furniture company in an industrial park in Binh Duong Province, which is next to Ho Chi Minh City.

News website VietNamNet cited the General Department of Preventive Medicine as saying that up to 138 people at the company showed symptoms of rubella virus infection. As of 23 Jan 2015, 29 of them have tested positive for the virus. Rubella, also known as German measles or 3-day measles, is a disease caused by a virus. The infection is usually mild with fever and rash, but dangerous for women during pregnancy. The virus is spread by contact with an infected person, through coughing and sneezing.

Over the past weeks health authorities in Ho Chi Minh City have performed testing, kept the infected persons in quarantine and implemented measures to contain the outbreak. Around 23 million children aged between 1 and 14 are supposed to receive free measles and rubella vaccines in 63 cities and provinces across Viet Nam under a campaign starting last September [2014]. At [the] last count more than 17 million of them have been vaccinated.

[The simplest explanation would be that the employees of the factory had not yet been included in the country-wide vaccination campaign. ProMED-mail would welcome clarification from any informed source.

The rubella vaccine is a live attenuated virus which is usually given as part of the MMR vaccine (protecting against measles, mumps, and rubella). Generally the MMR vaccine is recommended at 12-15 months (not earlier) and a 2nd dose when the child is 4-6 years old (before kindergarten or 1st grade). Rubella vaccination is particularly important for non-immune women who may become pregnant because of the risk of serious birth defects if they acquire the disease during pregnancy. - Mod.CP
