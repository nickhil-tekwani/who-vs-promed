Health authorities highlighted coordinated actions taken with
municipalities in order to define strategies for facing brucellosis
cases reported in Margen Sur de Rio Grande community, aiming to
control this outbreak.

Dr. Virna Almeida, head of the Epidemiology and Health Information
area in the Ministry of Health, pointed out that "We have advanced
conversations with the National Direction of Epidemiology, the Malbran
Institute, Mu√±iz Hospital, and also the Pan American Health
Organization, in order to perform next year a study for measuring the
prevalence of brucellosis in dogs, since the transmission (of
brucellosis from dogs) is quite unusual in humans".

In June 2011, a case of brucellosis was diagnosed in a 2-year old
girl, in Margen Sur community in Rio Grande; and the causative agent
was identified as _Brucella canis_. "This is a microorganism that
seldom causes disease in humans. Generally speaking, cases of
Brucellosis in humans are caused by _Brucella_ species whose reservoir
is cattle, and the condition is a food-borne disease, because of the
ingestion of non-pasteurized dairy products, or poorly-cooked meat",
Dr. Almeida explained.

Consequently, Dr. Almeida pointed out that "We were facing a very
unusual situation, diagnosing a disease that had never been detected
in this province, and learning that the vehicle was a pet dog". With
this situation, she said, "knowing there is a second case, the mother
of the affected child, adequate therapy was instituted in both
patients. However, considering the unusual pattern of transmission, we
decided to study possible human contacts; and in Rio Grande
Municipality, they also decided to study 97 dogs in the surrounding
areas in the community".

Dr. Almeida added that after this study, "last week results arrived
from Malbran Institute, and we found that 29 of 97 dogs had positive
serological test results for _Brucella canis_".
