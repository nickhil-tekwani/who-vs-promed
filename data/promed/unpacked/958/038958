The Government of Nunavut is warning residents about a syphilis outbreak in the territory. The government's Health Department said it identified the 1st case of the sexually transmitted infection in May [2012] and has since become concerned as the number of cases has continued to rise. 13 cases have been reported and all of them are in Iqaluit.

"I urge anyone who thinks they may be infected with syphilis to visit their health care provider today," said Dr Geraldine Osborne, the territory's Chief Medical Officer of Health. Osborne said it's unusual to see so many of the cases in Nunavut. She adds that she won't be surprised if the number climbs higher and spreads to other Nunavut communities. "Because people are mobile I'm expecting we'll see cases quite soon in other communities."

There have been 13 reported cases of syphilis in Iqaluit, and the territory's chief medical officer of health expects more instances of the disease to crop up among the population.

Dr Geraldine Osborne, Nunavut's chief medical officer of health, addressed media on the spread of syphilis in Iqaluit, against a backdrop of educational posters that are to be circulated around the city. "For us in Nunavut, it's an outbreak," said Dr Geraldine Osborne. Last year [2011], there were 5 reported cases. The year before that, there were none.

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) which can be contracted through unprotected vaginal, anal, or oral sex. It can also be passed from a mother to her baby while the infant is in the womb, which can cause death of the fetus or severe birth defects. Its symptoms vary, but often begin with a painless sore, which usually appears 3 to 90 days after the disease is contacted. The sore can heal without treatment, but the infection remains.

The secondary stage, which can occur 2 weeks to 6 months after initial symptoms, usually involves a rash, often on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. The disease can then lay latent for as long as 20 years, but the bacteria still spread throughout the body, and the disease's 3rd stage turns deadly -- organ damage, including that to the heart and brain, leads to death. Symptoms can also mimic other diseases, such as the flu. However, the disease, caused by the bacterium _Treponema pallidum_, is easily cured with a simple antibiotic treatment.

Osborne said the STI's pattern of transmission in Iqaluit has been largely the same as in other parts of Canada and other countries. "In the last 10 years, syphilis has re-emerged in the US, Europe, and southern Canada," said Osborne. "Generally, it starts in urban areas, particularly in high-risk groups such as men who have sex with men. Then it moves into the heterosexual population. It seems to be following the same pattern (here)."

According to the Centre for Communicable Diseases and Infection Control in Ottawa, a number of STIs have been on a dramatic rise since 1997. In 2009, the centre reported syphilis rates had risen in Canada by 782.1 percent, to an average of 1683 cases per 100 000 people from 174 per 100 000.

Osborne said the biggest risk factor in Nunavut for contracting the disease, and other STIs, is, of course, unprotected sex. Once a case arises, Osborne said tracing the disease through partners a person may have slept with can prove difficult, and she said it's likely there are more unreported cases within the city. "Occasionally, people will find this quite difficult because they've used drugs or alcohol and cannot identify all their partners, so this can be quite challenging."

Once an infected person is identified, it's vital, Osborne said, that the person is vigilant in not only helping identify his or her past partners, but in following their [own] treatment through to the end. The antibiotic treatment usually lasts around 2 weeks.

"In order to control this outbreak and eliminate syphilis in Nunavut, we depend on people being forthcoming if they have symptoms of syphilis or if they have the infection to come forward for testing and treatment, and they have to be forthcoming about their partners so that we can do good contact-tracing," said Osborne.

She said the age range for cases in the capital is from 20 to 48, and the cases mainly crop up in those who have had sex with multiple partners.

"For syphilis in particular, the best way of preventing [it] is to have one partner that you know doesn't have the infection," said Osborne. "The next best way is using condoms consistently and properly." The Department of Health and Social Services is circulating posters throughout the city warning of syphilis, particularly in all the bars.

Osborne also said the GN [Government of Nunavut] is developing a sexual health education framework, mainly geared at high school students, about which more information will be released this fall [2012].

[Nunavut, the largest federal territory of Canada, is the size of Western Europe; it comprises a major portion of Northern Canada, and has an estimated population in 2010 of about 33 000, mostly Inuit (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nunavut). The territorial capital Iqaluit, which had a population in 2011 of 6699, is located on the south coast of Baffin Island (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iqaluit). Iqaluit was founded in 1942 as an American airbase to provide a stopover and refueling site to support the war effort in Europe (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iqaluit#History). Iqaluit is only accessible by aircraft and, subject to ice conditions, by boat.

As in the USA, the rates of infectious syphilis in Canada have been increasing since about 2000. In Canada, the male-to-female rate ratio increased from 1.5:1.0 in 1999 to 6.4:1.0 in 2008, reflecting that more males than females were reported with infectious syphilis, and this disparity increased over time (http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/std-mts/report/sti-its2008/05-eng.php). In 2008, men accounted for 86.1 percent of reported cases. Between 1999 and 2008, the rate in men increased from 0.7 to 7.3 per 100 000 and in women increased from 0.5 to 1.1 per 100 000. In men, the highest reported rate of infectious syphilis was shared between 25-29 year olds and 30-39 year olds (13.3 per 100 000) (http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/std-mts/report/sti-its2008/05-eng.php). Together, these age groups accounted for almost 40 percent of reported cases in men in 2008. In women, the highest reported rate was in 20-24 year olds (3.6 per 100 000). In males, the greatest increase in reported rates of infectious syphilis between 1999 and 2008 was in 25-29 year olds.

Nunavut did not officially become a territory until 1999; prior to 1999, data for Nunavut was combined with Northwest Territories. In 2008, no cases of infectious syphilis were reported in Nunavut (http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/std-mts/report/sti-its2008/05-eng.php). The current outbreak of infectious syphilis in Iqaluit is said in the news report above to mimic that which is occurring in the rest of Canada, but details of the outbreak in Iqaluit such as gender, ethnicity, use of illicit drugs, sexual behavior, or prostitution, are not given in the news reports above.

Inuits comprise about 58 percent of Iqaluit's population (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iqaluit#Demographics) and they may constitute a large portion of the syphilis cases in Iqaluit, as in the Canadian province of Alberta, where infection rates of infectious syphilis are reported to be 18.6 times higher among young Aboriginal women and 2.8 times higher in Aboriginal men compared to their Caucasian counterparts (http://www.health.alberta.ca/documents/sti-syphilis-report-2010.pdf). These young Aboriginal women are reported to be largely linked to the "street based" sex trade, are often involved with problematic substance use, and are poor. (Aboriginal peoples in Canada comprise the First Nations, Inuit, and Metis; Metis are people with mixed First Nations and European ancestry).
