Fiji has recorded 44 cases of typhoid fever so far in 2022. Ministry of Health and Medical Services permanent secretary Dr James Fong said the Central Division recorded 14 cases, which he added was within the number of cases expected for this time of the year. He said the Northern Division reported 6 cases, which were mostly from Bua. He said that was also within the number of cases expected for this time of year.

"The Western Division has recorded 23 cases, with an increasing trend that has surpassed the outbreak threshold in the last 2 weeks," Dr Fong said. "Ten cases were recorded in the last 2 weeks from Ra, Sigatoka, Nadi, Lautoka, and Ba."

Dr Fong said typhoid fever was typically found in areas that did not have access to clean drinking water. He strongly urged people who live in rural areas, informal urban areas, and any other areas where access to clean drinking water was limited to boil all drinking water.

"We must all also continue to practice basic hygiene measures such as frequently washing hands with soap and water, especially after visiting the toilet and before eating or preparing food."

[Typhoid fever, so-called enteric fever, caused by _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhi, has a totally different presentation, often without diarrhea, from that of the more common kinds of salmonellosis.

Epidemiologically, usually spread by contaminated food or water, typhoid is not a zoonosis like the more commonly seen types of salmonellosis. Clinically, vomiting and diarrhea are typically absent; indeed, constipation is frequently reported. As it is a systemic illness, blood cultures are at least as likely to be positive as stool in enteric fever, particularly early in the course of the infection, and bone marrow cultures may be the most sensitive. The word typhoid (as in typhus-like) reflects the similarity of the louse-borne rickettsial disease epidemic typhus and that of typhoid fever; in fact, in some areas, typhoid fever is still referred to as abdominal typhus.

The classic food-related cluster of _S. enterica_ serotype Typhi in the USA occurred related to a summer house in the (still) wealthy suburb of New York City, Oyster Bay, Long Island, in August 1906. This was the still infamous cluster associated with "Typhoid Mary," or Mary Mallon, an Irish immigrant who was both a food preparer and a typhoid bacillus carrier.

Some strains of the organism have become quite antimicrobial resistant, particularly ones linked to Pakistan (refer to the See Also section below). - Mod.LL
