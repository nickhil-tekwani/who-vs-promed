Ebola virus disease, West Africa - update 5 Jun 2014
----------------------------------------------------
Guinea
------
Between 2 and 3 Jun 2014, 11 new cases (8 confirmed, 1 probable, and 2 suspected) and 3 new deaths were reported from Conakry (7 new cases and 1 death), Gueckedou (2 new cases and 1 death), Telimele (1 new case and 0 death), and Boffa (1 new case and 1 death).

This brings the cumulative total number of cases and deaths attributable to EVD [Ebola virus disease] in Guinea to 344 (laboratory confirmed 207, probable 81, and suspected 56) including 215 deaths.

The geographical distribution of these cases and deaths is as follows: Conakry (65 cases and 27 deaths; Gueckedou, 193 cases and 143 deaths; Macenta, 44 cases and 26 deaths; Dabola, 4 cases and 4 deaths; Kissidougou, 7 cases and 5 deaths; Dinguiraye, 1 case and 1 death; Telimele, 23 cases and 5 deaths; and Boffa, 7 cases and 4 deaths. In terms of isolation, 31 patients are currently hospitalized (6 in Conakry, 9 in Gueckedou, 15 in Telimele, and 1 in Boffa).

The number of contacts currently being followed-up countrywide is 987 distributed as follows: Conakry (329 contacts), Gueckedou (323 contacts), Macenta (176 contacts), Telimele (104 contacts) and Boffa (55 contacts).

Sierra Leone
------------
Between 2 and 5 Jun 2014, 9 new suspected cases were reported bringing the total number of EVD clinical cases to 81 (31 confirmed, 3 probable, and 47 suspected) including 6 deaths. Kailahun district is the epicentre of the outbreak in Sierra Leone. 11 cases are currently in isolation at Kenema Hospital. The number of contacts currently being followed-up is 30. Community resistance is hindering the identification and follow-up of contacts.

Liberia
-------
There have been no new confirmed cases since 6 Apr 2014. 11 contacts (5 health care workers and 6 community relatives) are currently being followed-up. These contacts are of the probable case from nearby Kailahun, Sierra Leone who died in Foya, Liberia. The dead body was taken back to Kailahun for burial.

The total number of cases is subject to change due to reclassification, retrospective investigation, consolidation of cases, and laboratory data and enhanced surveillance.

WHO response
------------
WHO and partners continue to support the implementation of preventive and control measures in affected countries. 6 experts and over 5000 PPEs (personal protective equipment) have been deployed to Sierra Leone to support the response operations. WHO also supported Sierra Leone in developing proposals which were submitted to CERF (UN Central Emergency Response Fund) for USD 238 000, OCHA (Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs) Emergency Fund (about USD 50 000), and DFID (UK Department for International Development) for GBP 200 000 [about USD 336 000]). A joint WHO/HQ and AFRO mission provided support to Guinea on reviewing the outbreak response operations. The total estimated budget for Sierra Leone EVD outbreak response is about USD 1.8 million.

On 3 Jun 2014, WHO facilitated a cross-border collaboration meeting between Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. They agreed to re-force cross-border surveillance and harmonise social mobilization communication tools to address community resistance.

WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event.

[2] Gaining community trust and confidence
Date: Fri 6 Jun 2014

The editorial today [7 Jun 2014] in The Lancet touched on community resistance as one of the factors that continue to fuel the [Ebola virus disease] outbreak. Incidents have included citizens in Guinea and Sierra Leone stoning health workers investigating the outbreak and people in Sierra Leone removing family members from health facilities.

The journal said the biggest challenge for the countries' health ministries and global health partners will be improving public awareness about a disease that is new to West Africa and building trust and confidence in the medical response.

[The situation appears to be deteriorating, with close to 1000 contacts needing to be followed up in Guinea alone, an almost impossible task. Cross-border traffic and funeral rites are also extremely difficult to control.

The occasional geographically challenged news outlet has headlined the latest update as occurring in New Guinea (Papua New Guinea)! The Ebolavirus-Reston (EBOVR) virus may indeed be present there, since that island nation in the Far East is close to the Philippines, where that strain originated (in spite of its name) -- but EBOVR has never been known to cause clinical disease in humans. - Mod.JW]
