Comments & Questions on Bird-to-Bird Transmission of West Nile Virus
--------------------------------------------------------------------

From: Hugh Whitney <HughWhitney@mail.gov.nf.ca>

Regarding the study on crows kept in confinement, considering how heavily
parasitised wild birds can be, was it considered that there may have been a
variety of ectoparasites feeding off the infected birds which then crawled
onto and infected the uninfected birds?

My question to the posting regarding the bird to bird transmission of WNV is
this. Were the birds treated for external biting insects/parasites prior to
being place in the aviary together? What was done to guarantee that the
aviary was biting insect/parasite free?

Being a wildlife rehabilitator, [I am aware that the bonded pairs [of many
species of birds} preen each other and often exchange food from their crops
with each other. I am guessing that if the virus is in all their organs, it
is probably also in their saliva. Also, if birds step in another infected
birds feces, and later scratch themselves and deposit the virus on their
feathers, they will ingest the virus when they preen. The virus [may also
probably be passed from parent to offspring during the spring and summer.
One other thought about bird-to-bird transmission of West Nile Virus. Have
other insect vectors been looked into besides mosquitoes? There are other
sucking/biting insects on birds that could spread the disease between the
birds. Some of these insects may also bite humans, many only bother birds.
Maybe you could check the parasites/insects found on already infected birds
and see if any of these insects also carry the virus, if you haven't already.

Is anyone conducting surveillance of bird populations on wintering grounds
for the presence of WNV? It would seem that as birds migrating from the
Pacific, Central, Mississippi, and Atlantic fly ways converge on common
wintering grounds, WNV will propagate in the populations, allowing the birds
to carry WNV back to their respective summer grounds. If this is the case,
shouldn't we be preparing for a much more widely disseminated threat next
summer?

I was wondering if, given the possibility of droplet transmission of WNV,
removing bird houses and bird feeders in areas where WNV is spreading might
slow spread of the virus. How would this hypothesis be tested? I would
suggest some kind of dacron tipped swab of bird-feeders and bird house
enclosures under use collected immediately into heat stable medium. If a WNV
PCR or LCR technique exists, this could reliably test for presence in a
sample of approximately 250 in an area where transmission is underway such
as NJ, NY, or Eastern Canada. Have any viral persistence of WNV studies been
documented?

[Perhaps those concerned in the experiments demonstrating bird-to-bird
transmission can provide some answers? The importance of the original
observations is surely that virus can pass directly between birds without
the intervention of a mosquito vector; the precise mechanism is less
relevant at this stage. - Mod.CP

Pigeons Identified As Source Of West Nile Virus In Israeli Kibbutz
------------------------------------------------------------------
Kibbutz Kabri, in the north of [Israel, has begun destroying its pigeons,
after the birds were found to be carrying West Nile virus. This is the first
time the virus has been discovered in pigeons. Until now, the only birds
known to carry the virus [in Israel were geese. The Health, Agriculture and
Environment Ministries agreed that the birds should be destroyed after
medical examinations discovered the virus in their brains.
According to Irit Rappaport, who is responsible for health and sanitation at
the kibbutz, 25 kibbutz members have been infected with the virus since
mid-August - out of about 350 in all of Israel - and 2 have died. [Of the
approximately 350 Israelis infected with the virus since the epidemic began
this summer, 26 have died. - Mod.CP "Kabri has never suffered from
mosquitoes, but we have a large population of pigeons here, and this aroused
suspicions," she said. "Tests of the pigeons confirmed this, and we decided
to thin out [the pigeon population to check the spread of the disease." Dr.
Michal Dar, chief physician for the Health Ministry's northern district,
also said there appears to be a clear connection between Kabri's large
pigeon population and the high number of kibbutz residents infected with the
virus. "The number of victims at Kabri over the last 2 months is slightly
less than half the number of victims in the entire north," she said.
