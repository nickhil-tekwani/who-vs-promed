The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) is warning the public not to consume the salted and cured fish product (fesikh) described below because it may be contaminated with spores of _Clostridium botulinum_. Toxins produced by this bacteria may cause botulism, a life-threatening illness.

The affected product, whole fesikh mullet, was sold in clear vacuum-packaged bags of varying count and weight, bearing no code or date information. This product was sold from Lotus Catering and Fine Food, 1960 Lawrence Ave. E, Toronto, ON, on or before 17 Apr 2012.

There have been 3 reported illnesses associated with the consumption of this product.

Food contaminated with _C. botulinum_ toxin may not look or smell spoiled. Consumption of food contaminated with the toxin may cause nausea, vomiting, fatigue, dizziness, headache, double vision, dry throat, respiratory failure and paralysis. In severe cases of illness, people may die.

[Many of the botulism risks related to salted, cured fish are a result of the fish not being adequately eviscerated. The viscera of the fish are the parts most likely to be contaminated. Although not stated, most cases of botulism associated with the aquatic environment are serotype E whereas most other cases in humans are either type A or B. - Mod.LL
