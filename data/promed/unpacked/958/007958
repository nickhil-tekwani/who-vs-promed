PENGUIN & ALBATROSS MORTALITY - NEW ZEALAND: REQUEST FOR INFO
=============================================================
Date: Sun, 09 Mar 1997 01:54:05 -0900
From: afdcd1@UAA.ALASKA.EDU (Dr. David Duffy)

URGENT REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.
At the same time as a significant die-off of Yellow-eyed penguins
(_Megadyptes
antipodes_) at the Otago Peninsula in the South Island of New Zealand, some
adults and chicks at the nearby Royal albatross colony at Taiaroa Head seem
to
have been affected in a similar manner.
This is a very small population of albatrosses nesting on the New Zealand
mainland and a critically endangered populations of penguins.
A similar concurrent die-off event occurred last in 1989, but at that time
for the albatrosses there was a more obvious relationship with high
temperatures, low humidity and lack of wind, causing the adult albatrosses
to die of extreme heat stress. On this occasion there has not been a heat
related factor and so far extensive testing of both the penguins and the
albatrosses has produced no answers, though marine bio-toxins have been
fingered as a likely cause both in 1989 and now for the penguins.
Significant algal blooms have occurred in New Zealand over the past 4-5
years which has affected shellfish with a range of biotoxins.
I would be interested in hearing of any similar events which have occurred
in
Procellariformes before, and an indication of any causes or effects which
have
been seen in other species.
