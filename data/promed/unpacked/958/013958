3 people died in past 2 days while at least 23 others are still in
critical condition due to food poisoning after taking khichui at an
Urs (religious congregation) in Saidpur upazila of Nilphamari district
on Sunday morning, 11 Dec 2011. Around 2000 people were attacked with
diarrhea after taking khichuri made of rice, pulse, vegetables and
beef at the Urs held at the shrine of Pir Daud Ali Khandakar at Aish
Dhal village of Kamar Pukur union in Saidpur upazila, said officials.

"Excessive dehydration caused deaths. Of the 90 people now undergoing
treatment at Rangpur Medical College Hospital, condition of 23 is
critical," said Toufiqul Islam, director of Rangpur Medical College
Hospital.

People caught diarrhea after eating the food that was served long
after preparation and kept in banned polythene bags, said Dr Abdul
Mazid, civil surgeon of Nilphamari. "In general, conditions of the
patients are improving. A mobile medical team is working in the area
and giving treatment door to door," he said.

Fazlul Haque Tansen, resident medical officer of Nilphamari Sadar
Modern Hospital, set up eight medical camps in the affected villages
while Moazzem Hossain, medical officer of Sayedpur Hospital, 10
others.

People from 15 villages of Saidpur upazila and Badarganj and Targanj
upazilas of Rangpur attended the Urs held at Aish Dhal on Saturday
night, 10 Dec 2011, locals said. In the next morning, the organizers
distributed khichuri among about 10,000 people who attended the
programme.

Many of them shared the food with their family members considering it
'sacred'. But after taking the khichuri, many people had vomiting with
diarrhea starting Sunday night.

Villages with larger number of affected people are Aish Dhal,
Kamarpukur, Pirpara, Haji Para Hajirbottola, Thakur Para, Nijbari,
Kacharipara, Jeje Para, Doctor Para, Kaji Pukur of Kamarpukur union of
Sayedpur and Santoshpur village of Badarganj upazila of Rangpur.

Sirajul Islam, resident medical officer of Saidpur 50-bed Hospital,
said, "A large number of patients from different villages started
thronging the hospital on Monday morning, 12 Dec 2011. Within a short
time, diarrhea patients filled the hospital. Most of them were lying
on the floor. We sent 30 patients to Rangpur Medical College Hospital
as their condition was more serious."
Around 300 people took treatment at the hospital. Most of them were
released as their condition improved.

[There is no supportive microbiological data here but the illness is
certainly compatible with _V. cholerae_ illness which has an
incubation of less than 1 day to 5 days and certainly can cause
rapidly fatal diarrhea. - Mod. LL]
