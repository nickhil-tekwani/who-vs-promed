Venezuela: Canine and Bovine Rabies Cases
-----------------------------------------
Regional Coordination of Zoonosis at Zulia state reported for the
Epidemiological Week No.21 (2004): 7 positive cases of canine rabies
from 4 different districts of Zulia: Maracaibo (the state capital) (2
cases), Rosario de Perija (2 cases), Mara (1 case) and Cabimas (2
cases). With these 7 cases, Venezuela has recorded 80 cases of canine
rabies for year 2004 (all reported in Zulia state).
In addition, for the same epidemiological week, 2 bovine rabies cases
were reported. One case was reported in Barinas state and was
confirmed by direct immunofluorescence tests, and the other was
reported at Apure state but is not yet confirmed.

[The prevalence of canine rabies in Zulia state represents a
continuing hazard for the human population. As of 1 May 2004, a total
of 21 cases of human rabies had been recorded over the course of the
past 13 years in Zulia state. 2 of these human cases -- both probably
contracted as a result of dog-bite -- occurred during the first 4
months of 2004. It would appear that little progress has been
achieved in the control of canine rabies in this part of Venezuela.
The 2 cases of bovine rabies did not occur in Zulia state and, as
elsewhere in the region, may be related to the activity of vampire
bats. - Mod.CP]
