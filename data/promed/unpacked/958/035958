A medical team in Nineveh Governorate, northern Iraq, deposited the stone after performing a surgical operation on a citizen, who later found out that he had anthrax.

The governor of Nineveh said in a press interview that "the initial diagnosis of one of the auditors was suffering from (appendicitis), where there is abdominal distension, but when a 2nd examination was conducted, it was proven to the contrary, and the tests showed that he had a hemorrhagic fever called (anthrax)."

He added that the competent (medical) cadres also quarantined his family members and all those who came into contact with him, and the veterinary departments were mobilized for the purpose of assessing the situation for fear of the presence of other cases.

The Ministry of Health had reassured citizens through Al-Mirbad after recording cases of anthrax in Dohuk governorate last August [2021], stressing that it is an endemic disease, and a few individual cases are recorded from it every year and is not epidemic, and it is a skin disease that is transmitted from animals to human.

Al-Jubouri said in an interview with the official agency, "One of the auditors at a hospital in the city of Mosul, the initial diagnosis was that he had (appendicitis), where there is abdominal distension, but when conducting a 2nd examination, it was proven to the contrary, and the tests showed that he had hemorrhagic fever, which is called "anthrax".

He added, "All the health staff who performed the operation for the infected person, as well as his family members and all those who came into contact with him, were booked, and the veterinary departments were mobilized for the purpose of assessing the situation for fear of the presence of other cases."

[I apologize for the almost word-for-word repetition but the first report mentioned depositing a stone as well as a diagnosis of appendicitis. This "stone" may be real or a local aphorism for an embarrassing surgical mistake.

With gastroenteric anthrax the abdomen fills with a hemorrhagic fluid containing the anthrax toxins. Efficient and successful treatment consists of antibiotic treatment and draining this fluid, which may have to be repeated a few times. Antibiotic treatment on its own may kill the pathogen, usually quickly, but does nothing to neutralise these toxins. The patient cannot recover until this fluid is gone and not reappearing.
