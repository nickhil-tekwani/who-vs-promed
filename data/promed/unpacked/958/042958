Abstract
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends rapid testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection as a key element of epidemic control. The Abbott BinaxNow is in widespread use in the United States for self-testing and as part of public health screening campaigns, but has not been evaluated for use with the omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2. We recruited individuals testing positive for COVID-19 PCR at an academic medical center. Anterior nasal swabs were stored in viral transport media and evaluated by viral load quantification and whole genome sequencing. We created serial dilutions from 2.5x103- 2.5x105 viral copies/specimen for 2 delta and omicron specimens, respectively, and tested each with the BinaxNow assay per manufacturer instructions. Results were interpreted by 3 readers, blinded to the specimen variant and concentration. All omicron and delta specimens with concentrations of 100 000 copies/swab or greater were positive by the BinaxNow Assay, a concentration similar to previously reported limits of detection for this assay. Assay sensitivity diminished below that. This study demonstrates that omicron variant SARS-CoV-2 infections are detected by the BinaxNow rapid antigen assay. Additional laboratory and clinical validation assessments are needed to better determine their limits of detection and performance in real-world settings.

[2] Omicron
Date: Wed 29 Dec 2021

Omicron variant activity is surging across the country ahead of the New Year's holiday, and while evidence is building that infections are less severe, the high volume of cases could still stress hospitals, federal health officials said today [Wed 29 Dec 2021] at a White House briefing. In global developments, omicron hot spots drove the global total higher, as new scientific findings had good news about booster doses and the immune response to omicron.

Rochelle Walensky, who directs the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said the 7-day average is at 240 400 cases a day, 60% higher than last week. She added that hospitalizations--which typically lag cases--are averaging 9000 a day, up 14% compared with last week.

In its latest Nowcast estimate, CDC pared back the percentage of omicron cases to 58.6% of sequenced cases, down from 73% last week, reflecting that while omicron is still dominant, especially in some regions, the USA is still feeling the impact from delta.

Five states -- Florida, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Delaware -- are reporting more new cases than at any other point during the pandemic, according to ABC News. [https://abcnews.go.com/Health/live-updates/coronavirus/?id= 81952698#81972675]

Regarding CDC's recently announced shortened times for isolation and quarantine, Walensky said the updated advice is weighted toward the time when people are most infectious, based on what's currently known. "The virus adapts quickly, and we must adapt with it," she said.

Addressing the issue of why the CDC did not recommend testing in the updated guidance, Walensky said that so far, it's not clear how antigen testing results relate to transmission at day 5 after an initial positive test, and the rapid tests aren't authorized for clearing people from isolation. However, she said masking and staying home when sick are critically important, and the science behind all of the measures were central to the updated recommendations. "They will only work if people follow them," she said of the new guidelines.

Tony Fauci, the White House's chief medical adviser, said data from international research groups and those in the United States hinting at a less severe infection from the omicron variant, though preliminary, are encouraging, with evidence getting stronger and stronger. However, it's not clear if the lower severity is driven by preexisting immunity, intrinsic characteristics of the variant, or both. And due to the sheer volume of cases, hospitals could still feel pressure, he noted.

Regarding rising hospitalizations in children, Fauci said there will naturally be more hospitalizations if infections are surging, but so far, it isn't clear if omicron illnesses are more severe in youngsters. New Year's revelers should only gather with family and friends who are vaccinated and boosted, though there is never a zero risk, Fauci said, adding that people should avoid larger parties, of [say] 40-50 people.

In other US updates, Jeff Zients, White House COVID-19 response coordinator, said about 1 million people are receiving booster shots each day, and nearly 2 of 3 seniors have received their 3rd shots. Regarding the earlier announced plan to provide 500 million rapid tests free of charge in January [2022], he said the government has accelerated the contract timeline to be finalized next week, with the first deliveries to follow. The government will launch a website that will allow Americans to order the rapid tests for free.

Global case rise fueled by omicron hot spots
--------------------------------------------
After a few weeks of a plateau pattern, global cases rose last week by 11% compared to the previous week, with the Americas and African regions showing the biggest rises, the World Health Organization (WHO) said yesterday [Tue 28 Dec 2021] in its weekly pandemic update. Meanwhile, deaths held steady. [https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/weekly-epidemiological-update-on-covid-19---28-december-2021]

At a WHO briefing today [Wed 29 Dec 2021], director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said omicron and delta are twin threats that are driving up case numbers, along with spikes in hospitalizations and deaths. [https://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-press-conference---29-december-2021]. "This is and will continue to put immense pressure on exhausted health workers and health systems on the brink of collapse and again disrupting lives and livelihoods," he said. "The pressure on health systems is not only because of new COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization but also a large number of health workers are getting sick themselves." He repeated his call for government leaders and industry to follow through on their promises to boost vaccine equity. Though supplies are improving, Tedros warned that the emphasis on boosters in high-income countries could prompt shortages again in low-income countries.

In other global developments
----------------------------
- Several countries saw cases soar to new daily record highs, including Australia. In Europe, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Greece, Spain, Portugal, and Malta were among the countries reporting record cases.

- A preprint study of about 12 000 households in Denmark suggests a notable drop in omicron transmission in people who had vaccine booster doses compared to households infected with delta.

[3] Antibody-mediated neutralization of omicron
Date: Wed 29 Dec 2021
Source: Medical Express [edited]
https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-12-omicron-variant-largely-resistant-current.html


[ref: Hoffmann M, et al, The Omicron variant is highly resistant against antibody-mediated neutralization - implications for control of the COVID-19 pandemic, Cell (2021). DOI: 10.1016/j.cell.2021.12.032]

The spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant harbors more than 30 mutations compared to the spike of the virus circulating during the early phase of the pandemic. The mutations in the spike protein cause most therapeutic antibodies to be ineffective against the omicron spike and omicron spike evades antibodies produced after infection or homologous (2-shot) BioNTech-Pfizer immunization. Antibodies induced upon triple immunization with BioNTech-Pfizer (= booster) or heterologous vaccination with Oxford-AstraZeneca/ BioNTech-Pfizer inhibited the omicron spike with increased efficiency. Therefore, booster and heterologous vaccination could provide stronger protection against the omicron variant.

The omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 is spreading at an alarming rate. It could soon replace the delta variant, which at present dominates globally. However, little is known about whether currently available vaccines and drugs will be effective against the omicron variant. To assess the efficiency of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies, a research team led by Stefan Pohlmann and Markus Hoffmann from the German Primate Center--Leibniz Institute for Primate Research in Gottingen and colleagues from the Hannover Medical School, the University of Gottingen Medical Center, the Friedrich-Alexander University of Erlangen-Nurnberg and the German Center for Infection Research in Braunschweig, have studied how efficiently the omicron variant is neutralized by antibodies from recovered and vaccinated people. An inhibition by T cells, which are produced after infection, remains to be analyzed.

The team was able to show that antibodies from recovered persons hardly inhibit the omicron variant. Antibodies after 2 BioNTech-Pfizer vaccinations also showed significantly reduced efficacy against the omicron variant. Better inhibition was observed after triple BioNTech-Pfizer vaccination as well as after heterologous vaccination with Oxford-AstraZeneca and BioNTech-Pfizer. Finally, most of the therapeutic antibodies evaluated in the study were not effective against the omicron variant. These results indicate that several antibodies used to treat COVID-19 will be ineffective against the omicron variant. However, they also suggest that a 3rd immunization with the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine (booster) and heterologous immunization may protect well against the omicron variant.

Infection with SARS-CoV-2 and vaccination leads to the production of antibodies that strongly contribute to protection against severe disease. In addition, combinations of antibodies produced by biotechnology approaches are being used to treat COVID-19. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 facilitates viral entry into cells and constitutes the central target for antibodies that inhibit (neutralize) the virus. Therefore, it is important to determine whether the omicron spike is inhibited by antibodies induced upon vaccination or infection or currently used for COVID-19 treatment. The researchers investigated these questions using non-hazardous virus-like particles that carry the omicron spike and are well suited for analysis of virus entry and its inhibition.

Currently, combinations of the antibodies Casirivimab and Imdevimab, and Etesevimab and Bamlanivimab are used to treat COVID-19. However, the team showed that these antibodies are largely ineffective against the omicron spike. Only one antibody, Sotrovimab, inhibited the omicron spike. "Our cell culture studies suggest that most antibodies currently available for COVID-19 therapy will be ineffective against omicron. Sotrovimab is an exception and could become an important treatment option for omicron-infected patients," concluded Hoffmann.

The researchers further investigated whether patients infected in Germany during the 1st wave of the pandemic had produced antibodies that protect against the omicron variant. While the antibodies inhibited the spike of the virus responsible for the 1st wave, they had little effect against the omicron spike. Therefore, it can be assumed that these individuals do not have robust immune protection against the omicron variant, although an inhibition by T cells, which are also produced during infection, remains to be analyzed.

Antibodies produced after 2 immunizations with the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine also inhibited the omicron spike significantly less efficiently than the spike proteins of other variants. A better protective effect was observed after 3 immunizations with BioNTech-Pfizer and after heterologous immunization with Oxford-AstraZeneca/BioNTech-Pfizer. These results indicate that dual immunization with BioNTech-Pfizer may protect less efficiently against the omicron variant as compared to the delta variant. In contrast, triple immunization with BioNTech-Pfizer (booster) and cross-vaccination with Oxford-AstraZeneca/BioNTech-Pfizer could establish stronger protection.

[4] Schools

https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/dec/27/staff-shortages-could-force-schools-in-england-to-send-some-pupils-home-omicron


Headteachers say absence caused by spread of omicron variant could undermine government's effort to keep children in schools. Severe staff shortages could undermine the government's efforts to keep pupils in schools, with headteachers in England saying that they may be forced to send some children home if they cannot muster enough staff.

Despite a pledge by [prime minister] Boris Johnson to avoid a repeat of January 2021, when the government insisted schools would remain open only for them to be closed after an abrupt U-turn, school leaders are warning that the rapid spread of the omicron variant could lead to mass absences for teachers and other members of staff when schools reopen for the new year.

Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, told the BBC that staff absences had been at "unsustainable" levels at some schools, with up to 25% of staff off in the week leading up to the Christmas break. "We don't know what next week will look like. We're not catastrophising that but we are saying we must have a sense of realism around this," he said.

Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said it would be "naive" to think omicron would not have an impact on schools when they reopen. "It does seem as though choppy waters lie ahead and that some form of disruption at the start of next term is looking sadly inevitable."

Barton said he "absolutely agrees" with the government's guidance allowing schools to restrict attendance only as a last resort, but argued that school leaders would need to make difficult choices if there were widespread staff absences. "The problem is that if you are running a primary school, and you have got 20 staff and 7 of them can't come in next week, and the pool of supply teachers that you would normally call upon - that is, people have got a relationship with your school and therefore will come and step in at the last minute or a supply agency that will charge you money for doing that at a higher rate - that pool is limited," Barton said.

"You will find yourself in a very difficult position of perhaps trying to teach 2 classes at once in the hall, stuff which will not be good for the quality of education, or you will be in the position of making a decision about whether some year groups should be in school while some aren't." Barton said secondary school leaders could be faced with the dilemma of prioritising classroom teaching for year groups taking exams ahead of teaching for others, "because GCSEs and A-levels really need to go ahead if possible this year".

Last week [w/e 26 Dec 2021] the Department for Education launched a public relations campaign to encourage former teachers in England to sign up with supply agencies, with the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, urging people "to come forward if they are available to temporarily fill absences in schools and colleges in the new year."

The Daily Telegraph reported that DfE sources were unable to confirm how many had actually signed up with agencies so far, but that it was "at least hundreds".

[The US is likely to experience the same dilemma. With the new CDC guidance, teachers and school staff will return to work 5 days after having tested positive for COVID, and without having performed an antigen test showing negative results. They may become unwitting virus spreaders in the school. This will lead to more staff being forced to stay home. Thus, in spite of having the best intentions to maintain a tolerable and functional work/school world, the shortened quarantine time may exacerbate that goal.

There is a lot of disagreement regarding the CDC pronouncement and it is worth reading and considering both sides. - Mod.LK]

A global total of 7587 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 28 Dec 2021 to late 29 Dec 2021). The major differences seen over the holiday period will most likely continue over the coming weekend, the rolling 7-day averages are a more precise indicator to follow the trends of the pandemic, while the inflated or under-reported numbers on day to day basis can be misleading.

A total of 68 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 48 of the 77 countries are from the European region, 9 are from the Americas region, 5 are from the Western Pacific region, 2 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 from the South East Asia region, and 11 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 47.5%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 3.1%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 76.9% increase in daily reported cases and an 18.6% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: Globally over 1 600 000 newly confirmed infections were reported in the past 24 hours; there are now over 284.90 million cumulative reported cases and over 5.43 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
