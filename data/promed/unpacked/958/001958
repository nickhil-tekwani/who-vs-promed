Dhamar Governorate, central Yemen, has recorded during the past 2 weeks a remarkable increase in the number of deaths of children and infants due to infection with a new disease that doctors have not been able to accurately diagnose until now.

Medical sources in Dhamar reported that the health authorities recorded 20 mysterious deaths among children in the past few days as a result of a new and strange disease. She explained that the disease largely targets children and infants, as the affected child suffers from difficulty breathing and oxygen entering the body before death is announced within hours.

The sources indicated that Dhamar hospitals received similar cases of children suffering from difficulty breathing, as the injured fell into a coma for hours before sudden death inside the intensive care rooms.

Medical sources confirmed that the number of deaths may be large and may exceed 50 cases among children in the governorate, but most of the deaths were not recorded or reported, especially in the countryside. She explained that in the Anas district alone, nearly 12 deaths were recorded, while there were deaths in the city and the rest of Dhamar districts, according to what was reported by the news website NewsYemen.

It explained that the symptoms of the disease are the closest to diphtheria, which is caused by a bacterium known as _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, and the germs that cause it usually spread in wet droplets that come out with coughing, where they multiply in the mucous membrane of the mouth and throat.

Local sources spoke of the widespread and frightening spread of this disease in Dhamar Governorate, especially in the Hada and Ans districts and other rural areas, noting that the death rates among Dhamar children are on the rise without an accurate medical diagnosis or treatment.

[ProMED reported multiple times on diphtheria in Yemen in 2018 and 2017 (see alsos below). In May 2018, there were a total of 1725 suspected cases of diphtheria in 20 of Yemen's 23 provinces, and the World Health Organization (WHO) said that the diphtheria outbreak killed at least 91 people in Yemen since October 2017. In March 2018, UNICEF and Yemen's health authorities were reported to have launched a large-scale vaccination campaign across the country to combat the disease (ProMED post Diphtheria - Yemen (05): fatal, more cases 20180515.5797347).
