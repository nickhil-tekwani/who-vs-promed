Cryptosporidiosis from swimming pool
---------------------------------
4 public swimming pools were ordered closed Friday after an outbreak of
illness caused by cryptosporidium, a parasite spread by human and animal waste.
Lawrence-Douglas County Health Department Director Kay Kent said 11 people
had been diagnosed with illness caused by the bacteria since early July
2003. The victims had been swimming at the 4 pools.
"Even if swimming pools were not the original source" of the infection, she
said, "we're recommending the hyperchlorination of the pools where we have
had positive cases."
Kent closed the city's Lawrence Aquatic Center and the pool at Alvamar Golf
and Country Club. She also requested the closing of pools at Kansas
University's Robinson Center and Haskell Indian Nations University. Those
are state and federal facilities, respectively, not subject to the health
department's jurisdiction. Officials said Lawrence's water supply was not
in danger.
Cryptosporidium is a microscopic parasite that causes diarrhea, loose or
watery stool, stomach cramps, upset stomach, and a slight fever. It can be
fatal to patients with weakened immune systems, such as the young, elderly,
or people with HIV. More than 2/3 of those who contract cryptosporidiosis
are children.
The parasite is easily passed in swimming pools, because it is able to
survive outside the body for long periods of time and is resistant to
chlorine disinfection. The city's outdoor pool closed at 5 p.m. Friday
instead of the usual 9 p.m. City Manager Mike Wildgen said Carl Knox
Natatorium was being shut down and also would be treated. The Indoor
Aquatic Center was already closed for maintenance.
Lynn Bretz, a KU spokeswoman, said a diving pool at Robinson already was
closed for maintenance. The university is complying with the health
department's request and closing the other pool at the center, a lap pool.
Kent said there were no outbreaks of cryptosporidium in Douglas County in
2002. 2003's first case appeared in early July; by 23 July, officials knew
that more than one person had contracted the parasite. 10 of the 11 people
diagnosed with illness had recently been swimming at one of the 4 pools,
Kent said. But the origins of the outbreak remain unknown. Anyone who has
had diarrhea should avoid swimming for 2 weeks, Kent said, to avoid passing
the parasite to others.

difficult to control cryptosporidia through chlorination, and "fecal
accidents" from swimmers continuously risk introducing new parasites. - Mod.EP]
