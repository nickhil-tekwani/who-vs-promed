The FBI is investigating letters claiming to contain anthrax bacteria
delivered Friday to a Planned Parenthood clinic in Indianapolis and four
others in three states. Threatening letters were also delivered to Planned
Parenthood clinics in Bloomington and New Albany, said Delbert Culp,
president of Planned Parenthood of Central and Southern Indiana. Women's
Health Services, a private abortion clinic in Louisville, Ky., received a
similar threat, FBI special agent Charles E. Riley III said. Other clinics
in more states are reportedly investigating similar incidents.
There are no suspects.
At least 31 people were treated for possible exposure to the deadly
biological toxin at a Planned Parenthood clinic at East 21st Street and
Ritter Avenue in Indianapolis. The 31 people included two police officers,
two firefighters, and the postal carrier who delivered the letter.
The Planned Parenthood clinic on the Eastside received a letter with a
Cincinnati postmark shortly after 1 p.m. Friday with a simple message --
"You have been exposed to anthrax," according to the Indianapolis Fire
Department. Police and health and safety workers swooped in soon after to
quarantine the people in the building. At least a dozen professionals from
the fire department's hazardous materials team entered the building in
white decontamination suits with surgical masks and safety glasses to treat
those inside. After being stripped and scrubbed down, the people in the
clinic were being taken to Wishard and Methodist hospitals late Friday
afternoon.
It was unclear if the letter actually contained anthrax [_Bacillus
anthracis_]. But even if it was a hoax, it looked real, according to fire
Lt. Jack Cassaday. "It looked like Anthrax so whoever sent it knew enough
to package it the right way," he said. The substance was being tested at a
local lab, Cassaday added.
"No one is sick, no one is experiencing pain," said Maj. Tim Horty of the
Indianapolis Police Department.
Clinic administrators isolated the envelope in the clinic, but didn't say
where or how, Horty said. Police evacuated all other stores in the strip
mall and immediately quarantined the clinic. It was not immediately clear
whether the letter contained anthrax or any other biological agent. "We do
not know that. But we are handling it as if it were," Horty said.
"The people who were exposed are not in any danger," Cassaday said. The
hospitals and 911 have been inundated by calls from people in the area who
think they might have been exposed, Cassaday said. "No one who was not
inside the clinic could have possibly been exposed," he said.
Horty said he didn't know if the clinic had any previous threats.
Clinics in New Albany and Bloomington were not evacuated, authorities said.
Authorities are in the process of having the powder analyzed and hope to
know by late Sunday night or early Monday whether it is anthrax, said
Virginia A. Caine, Marion County Health Department director.
"We receive threats from time to time, but nothing very substantial. The
employees here did the appropriate thing. This did not look suspicious
until they opened it," Culp said. "These are just political extremists who
call themselves pro-life. This is not pro-life. This is trying to strike
down 29 people with a deadly disease."

[I have held back from commenting on such events because they do not need
broadcasting, but this report has been widely disseminated this weekend in
North America. We can therefore expect even more copycat events by other
individuals who, like most arsonists, enjoy witnessing the exciting
reactions. An informed colleague in the FBI tells me that they have been
investigating, on average, 1-2/week of such events throughout the summer.
They have become very experienced in handling them and usually the response
is calmer than this one in Indianapolis; and arrests have been made.
Unfortunately, because of the extreme perceived risks by the public and
local government officials a calm minimal response is not always
politically expedient however medically relevant. - Mod.MHJ]
