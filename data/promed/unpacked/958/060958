Avian life in Tunisia has experienced a dramatic event in recent days,
following the mass mortality of thousands of birds (preliminary
estimate of 10 000 birds) under mysterious circumstances. The
circumstances are, at present, unexplained.

Several sources confirm a significant increase in mortality of wild
birds in the wetlands of the north (Lake and Sabkhat Sejoumi Echkeul
and Ghar el melh). Similar cases have been reported from Ontario in
Canada, Falkoping in southwestern Sweden, Louisiana and Arkansas
(USA), and now Tunisia.

Veterinarians are trying to find an explanation for this unusual
incident that has appeared for the 1st time, at this size, in
Tunisia:

Hypothesis 1: The System PBX (telephone network) is singled out
because it generates magnetic fields that affect the nervous system of
birds.

Hypothesis 2: Walking difficulties have been described among the
symptoms. It seems that preliminary investigations are moving towards
a conclusion of botulism. Botulism affects the nervous system, is
often foodborne, and is caused by the action of bacterial neurotoxins
(botulinum toxin) produced by _Clostridium botulinum_.

Hypothesis 3: These deaths are collective mortalities following the
destruction of the ecological niche of some species by the action of
pollution or urban development, which make the possibility of
populating this environment close to zero or low.

Everything possible must be done by research organizations and
Tunisian environmental investigation forces to decipher the mysterious
event that threatens the birds of Tunisia.

"Observation of this phenomenon in Tunisia has now gone on for about 2
weeks [23 Oct - 11 Nov 2011]. The deaths of 500 birds have been
reported in Ichkeul in Sebkhet Sejoumi in the region of Bizerte and
Hammamet.

Several teams from the association "Les Amis des Oiseaux" and other
birders have traveled to many wetlands (and other sites) in the north
and south of Tunisia, and after heavy rains, we have found more
unusual mortality.

We have no confirmed explanation for the thousands of birds that have
been found dead under unusual circumstances during the past 2 weeks,
but we expect an official communication from the authorities,
especially with regard to the results of sampling done on dead birds
and analyses of wetlands involved."

[The episode apparently is taking place in wetlands, but there is no
mention of the species affected, ages, or other important details of
the outbreak. Given the acute characteristic of this die-off, it could
be botulism or another toxin or contaminant, or an infectious disease.
More information on the die-off and on the current investigation is
hereby requested - Mod.PMB]
