Event Description
-----------------
On [29 Jun 2018], the Uganda Ministry of Health notified WHO of an outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in Isingiro and Kasese districts, all located in the western region of the country. On [28 Jun 2018], 2 unrelated simultaneous cases were confirmed, one in each district. The 1st case-patient was a 47-year-old male from Kanyatsi village in Munkunyu sub-county, Kasese District, whose main occupation was as a butcher. He fell ill on [20 Jun 2018] with symptoms of fever and headache, and self-administered antimalarial treatment. The case-patient died at home on the evening of [21 Jun 2018], with the body oozing blood from multiple orifices. The district health authority collected a nasal swab (posthumous) on notification of the death and the specimen was sent to the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) on [25 Jun 2018]. The test result released on [28 Jun 2018] was positive for RVF by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

The 2nd case-patient was a 35-year-old male casual labourer and herdsman from Kabare village in Isingiro town council, Isingiro District. The village is located near Lake Nakivale and borders Lake Mburo National park. On [25 Jun 2018], he developed fever, headache, and anorexia, which was followed by epistaxis. He presented to the local health facility the same day, but was immediately referred to the regional referral hospital because of the severity of his illness and suspicion of a viral haemorrhagic disease. The case-patient was admitted in the isolation unit. A blood specimen was obtained and shipped to UVRI on [26 Jun 2018]. The test result released by UVRI on [28 Jun 2018] was positive for RVF on RT-PCR. The case-patient died on [30 Jun 2018] and a supervised burial was carried out.

There is a report of another confirmed RVF case in Ibanda District, on which more information is being sought and 2 other suspected cases are reportedly being investigated in Mbarara (1) and Kasese (1) districts. Additionally, 55 animal specimens were collected from the farm where one of the confirmed cases worked and in Isingiro town council abattoir.

A further update will be provided on the evolution of this event.

Public Health Actions
---------------------
- A national rapid response team from the Ministry of Health, the Public Health Fellowship Program, UVRI, and the National Animal Disease Diagnostics of the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries was constituted and deployed to the affected districts to conduct outbreak investigation and support response activities.
- The isolation unit in Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital has been designated as the main treatment centre, while the district hospitals have also been prepared to handle cases.
- A supervised safe and dignified burial was conducted for both fatal cases.
- Active surveillance is being enhanced and healthcare workers have been urged to maintain a high index of suspicion for RVF in affected districts.
- Infection prevention and control practices are being improved through use of personal protective equipment that was prepositioned by WHO in the hospitals.
- A limited quantity of information, communication and education materials was provided to the district health teams to facilitate health education in the communities.

Situation Interpretation
------------------------
In Uganda, 2 districts have simultaneously confirmed RVF cases, with a possible 3rd one. This outbreak has occurred at a time when Kenya is reporting a large RVF outbreak and Rwanda is experiencing an epizootic, with suspected human cases. The affected districts in Uganda fall within the cattle corridor, stretching from the south-western, through central to north-eastern parts of the country. With the ongoing/approaching rainy season and in line with the risk modeling carried out by FAO in May 2018 (showing suitability for vector amplification in several countries in East Africa), the ongoing RVF outbreaks in Uganda and in the subregion may have wider public health and economic impacts if not attended to appropriately. There is a need to strengthen response and preparedness in Uganda and the other neighbouring countries, with a One Health approach, focusing on both human and animal health interventions.

[There are now 2 confirmed human cases of Rift Valley fever in Uganda. Given the Rift Valley fever (RVF) outbreak in Kenya involving domestic animals and humans, it is not surprising that there is a human case in neighboring Uganda. A Sun 24 Jun 2018 report from a meeting of 11th meeting of the Sectoral Council on Agriculture and Food Security (SCAFS) that just concluded in Dar es Salaam, has directed the East African Community (EAC) secretariat to address the issue of Rift Valley fever promptly. It stated that this year's [2018] heavy rainfall has resulted in widespread flooding in low-lying grasslands. Flooding and standing water enabled a higher number of mosquito eggs than usual to hatch and thus increased the potential for RVF to spread among people and animals.

The RVF virus is endemic in the EAC region and has caused repeated outbreaks in the past. It affects primarily ruminant livestock, such as cattle, sheep, goats, and camels and also wildlife such as buffalos. In these animals, it causes abortions and deaths and significant economic loss.

The RVF virus can also affect humans. Most infections are mild, but some people fall severely ill and even die, with symptoms such as fever, weakness, and bleeding from gums and mouth. The majority of human infections result from direct or indirect contact with the blood, body fluids, or tissues of infected animals. This can happen during slaughtering or butchering, while assisting with animal births, treating the animals, and from contact with disposed carcasses or fetuses. - Mod.TY
