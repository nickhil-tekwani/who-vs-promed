[1] Case update
- Epidemiological situation
23 May 2018. Democratic Republic of Congo, Ministry of Health

The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease dated 22 May 2018:
- a total of 58 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, including 30 confirmed, 14 probable, and 14 suspected;
- the investigations invalidated 8 of the 17 historical probable cases reported in Bikoro. As a reminder, these community deaths occurred in the weeks preceding the official notification that triggered the outbreak on 8 May 2018. As a result, these 8 cases were removed from the table;
- 9 new suspected cases, including 2 in Bikoro, 4 in Iboko, 3 in Wangata;
- 2 new cases confirmed in Iboko;
- 1 community death in Bikoro: body samples could not be taken because of the resistance of the community. This death was thus classified among the probable cases;
- 2 deaths from confirmed cases in Wangata 2 negative tests in Iboko

Remarks
-------
- Negative tests are systematically removed from the summary table.
- The category of probable cases includes all reported deaths for which it was not possible to obtain biological samples for laboratory confirmation.

News about the Ebola response
------------------------------
The 1st working session with ASSORBIKO (Association of Nationals of Bikoro), which is based, in Kinshasa was held.
- In view of the resistance reported in the community of Bikoro to cooperate with health professionals, the Ministry of Health, represented by the Director of the National Program of Communication for the Promotion of Health (PNCPS), Mr Raoul Kamanda, held a 1st strategic communication session with ASSORBIKO to join community efforts in managing the Ebola response in this country.
- This collaboration will contribute to the community relay strategy, aiming to involve all social actors (churches, associations, etc.) in raising [awareness of the disease and of the danger it poses], but especially, to adapt communication by making it accessible and translated into dialect "Ntomba" to better get closer to the population of Bikoro.

Incident at the Wangata treatment center
----------------------------------------
- Between Sun 20 and Tue 22 May 2018, 3 patients voluntarily left the isolation zone of Wangata Hospital (Mbandaka), supported by the Ministry of Health and Médecins Sans Frontières. The 1st patient, who was about to be cured, left the hospital on Sunday night. The other 2 left the facility with their families on the night of Monday to Tuesday: one of them died at his home, and his body was brought back to the health center for a safe burial, assisted by the teams from MSF.

The 2nd was brought back to the center on Tue 22 May 2018 in the morning and he died during the night. He was buried on Wed 23 May 2018, according to the proper procedures.

- In all 3 cases, as the Minister of Health explained, hospitals and Ebola treatment centers are not prisons. Even in times of epidemic, health professionals have a duty to respect the will and dignity of patients.

- There is much fear and confusion about Ebola in affected communities. The priority of the Ministry of Health is to reinforce community communication actions in order to sensitize the local population about the symptoms, the importance of going to the health structures quickly, and respecting the isolation measures, in order to stem the spread of the disease. The sooner patients are cared for, the greater their chances of recovery -- this also limits the risk of spread.

Use of a new experimental Ebola treatment
-----------------------------------------
- The Ministry of Health has asked the US authorities to test the mAB114 treatment during the current outbreak.
- mAB114 is an antibody derived from the research that Professor Jean-Jacques Muyembe of the National Institute for Biomedical Research has done on the basis of the serum of a survivor of the Ebola epidemic of Kikwit in 1995. This research began 3 years ago.
- In order to test the effectiveness of the treatment, they did tests on monkeys to which were injected with the Ebola virus. All monkeys treated with mAB114 were cured.
- The effective use of this antibody in the Democratic Republic of Congo will depend on the approval of the ethics committee of the School of Public Health of the University of Kinshasa.

[2] Quarantine breaches
- 23 May 2018. Ebola patients slip out of Congo hospital as medics try to control outbreak.
Reuters [edited] https://reut.rs/2J4Q8Um [Byline: Patient Ligodi]

Health officials said 3 patients infected with the Ebola virus slipped out of an isolation ward at a hospital in the Congolese city of Mbandaka, as medics raced to stop the deadly disease from spreading in the busy river port.

The cases represent a setback to costly efforts to contain the virus, including the use of an experimental vaccine, and show efforts to stem its spread can be hampered by age-old customs or scepticism about the threat it poses.

Two patients left the hospital on Monday night [21 May 2018] with the help of family members, then headed to a church, the World Health Organization's spokesman in Congo, Eugene Kabambi, told Reuters.

One died at home the next day and was buried with the help of medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). The other was sent back to hospital and died that night, Kabambi said.

Health Ministry sources, who asked not to be named, said 2 police officers had been deployed to help track them down.

Another patient who was close to being discharged left on Sunday evening [20 May 2018] but was later found, Kabambi said.

The WHO and MSF said they could not force patients to stay in hospital but hoped that growing awareness of the disease and its risks would convince people to follow medical advice. "This is a hospital. It's not a prison. We can't lock everything," Henry Gray, the head of the MSF mission in Mbandaka, told Reuters.

WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said health workers had redoubled efforts to trace contacts with the patients. Health workers have drawn up a list of 628 people who have had contact with known cases who will need to be vaccinated.

"It is unfortunate but not unexpected," he said. "It is normal for people to want the loved ones to be at home during what could be the last moments of life."

"The next few weeks will really tell if this outbreak is going to expand to urban areas or if we're going to be able to keep it under control," WHO's emergency response chief, Peter Salama, said at the UN body's annual assembly [21-26 May 2018]. "We're on the epidemiological knife edge of this response."

...The WHO said health workers were following up on 3 separate transmission chains for cases in Mbandaka's Wangata neighborhood -- one linked to a funeral, one to a church, and another to a rural health facility.

- 23 May 2018. 3 Ebola patients escape quarantine in large Congolese city amid growing outbreak
ABC News [edited] https://abcnews.go.com/International/ebola-patients-escape-quarantine-large-congolese-city-amid/story?id=55378245 [Byline: Louise Dewast, Morgan Winsor]

WHO staff in the Democratic Republic of Congo have "redoubled" their efforts to trace everyone who came into contact with the 3 patients [discussed in the report above], Jasarevic added.
"Because Ebola virus is not like any other disease and because exposure to the dead body or bodily fluids or personal items of the person who died of Ebola can spread the disease, it is important for us to be able to explain these issues to the family members," he added. "We are working with local community leaders, traditional leaders and healers, and religious leaders to better engage with communities so that we understand each other better and can work together in stopping the outbreak."

Convincing residents in the Central African nation to seek treatment and utilize safe practices to prevent the spread of the deadly disease is a challenge. Many of them follow religious and traditional practices, especially during funerals, which are not necessarily aligned with health recommendations.

Those who live in more rural and remote areas may not believe Ebola is real or that Western medicine can help.

So the country's health ministry and its international partners, such as the WHO and Oxfam, are conducting awareness campaigns by organizing community dialogues and going door-to-door to advise people on what hygiene precautions to take in times of outbreaks. ...

- 23 May 2018. 3 Ebola patients fled quarantine in Congo, sparking fears that the disease may spread.
Washington Post [edited] https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/05/23/three-ebola-patients-fled-quarantine-in-congo-sparking-fears-that-the-disease-may-spread/ [Byline: Siobhán O'Grady]

Health officials in Congo are anxious to contain the country's deadly Ebola outbreak -- which has already spread to an urban area -- before the situation gets any worse. But controlling the virus may have just gotten tougher.

On [Wed 23 May 2018], the Doctors Without Borders [MSF] mission in the Congolese city of Mbandaka announced that 3 Ebola patients there had left a hospital isolation ward and reentered the general population.

One patient left [Sun 20 May 2018], shortly before being discharged, and is still alive, according to the aid group. 2 others left overnight [Mon 21 Ma 2018]; one died outside of quarantine, and another was brought back to the hospital and died there.

"In all 3 cases, every effort was made by staff at the hospital to convince the patients -- and their families -- not to leave and to continue their treatment," Brienne Prusak, a press officer for MSF, as Doctors Without Borders is frequently known, said in a statement.

Eugene Kabambi, the World Health Organization's spokesman in Congo, told Reuters that 2 of the patients' families helped them leave the hospital [Mon 21 May 2018], then brought them to a church.

"It is unfortunate but not unexpected," said WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic. "It is normal for people to want the loved ones to be at home during what could be the last moments of life."

Now comes the challenge of determining who the patients may have come into contact with once they left the hospital in the city of more than 1 million people. There have been 58 confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of Ebola -- and 27 deaths -- as of [Tue 22 May 2018]. That number could dramatically increase if the disease were to spread widely in a major city.

When Ebola hit West Africa in 2014, some of the obstacles that impeded the medical response included lack of trust among communities dealing with outbreaks and religious practices -- such as washing the body of the dead -- that spread the disease, which is contagious through bodily fluids. Community outreach to religious leaders in particular helped familiarize communities with the proper safety protocols.

But lack of trust between patients and doctors is often the reason those sick with Ebola would attempt to evade treatment, which can be intimidating when it involves isolating them from their families and only interacting with medical professionals dressed in hazmat suits. In previous Ebola outbreaks, patients have also left the hospital despite doctors urging them not to.

MSF is warning against seeing "forced hospitalization" as the solution to the outbreak. "Patient adherence is paramount," Prusak said. "The quicker patients are admitted, the greater their chance of survival, and the greater the chance of limiting the spread of Ebola."

- 24 May 2018. 2 Congo Ebola patients attended church with 50 people before dying: MSF
Reuters [edited] https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-ebola-congo/two-congo-ebola-patients-attended-church-with-50-people-before-dying-msf-idUSKCN1IP1PT [Byline Stephanie Nebehay]

Two Ebola patients who fled a Congo hospital went to a prayer meeting with 50 other people, potentially exposing them all to the deadly virus, a senior aid worker said on [Thu 24 May 2018].

Both patients were vomiting and infectious and died hours after the prayer session in the port city of Mbandaka, Dr Jean-Clement Cabrol, emergency medical coordinator for Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders), said.

Democratic Republic of Congo is racing to contain an outbreak of the disease which spreads through contact with infected bodily fluids.

The 2 patients slipped out of an isolation ward at the hospital on Monday night [21 May 2018].

"The escape was organized by the families, with 6 motorcycles as the patients were very ill and couldn't walk," Cabrol told a news briefing in Geneva on return from the affected region.

"They were taken to a prayer room with 50 people to pray. They were found at 2 in the morning, one of them dead and one was dying. So that's 50-60 contacts right there. The patients were in the active phase of the disease, vomiting."

[Escape, elopement, voluntary leave -- whatever one wishes to call it, the departure of infectious Ebola patients from a treatment facility is an alarming development. Such actions endanger the general population and make contact tracing exponentially more difficult. Although MSF undoubtedly made every effort to dissuade patients from leaving the hospital, allowing them to do so directly contradicts the 1st of MSF's own "Six Pillars of Ebola Control": the isolation and care of patients. (http://www.msf.org/sites/msf.org/files/msf1yearebolareport_en_230315.pdf).

It is true that hospitals are not prisons, and MSF and WHO are not legal authorities. But this is precisely the role of government and civil authorities, to step in to this "grey zone" between individual rights and the necessity and duty to protect the general public. Otherwise, the situation could quickly degenerate into chaos and panic at all levels, from neighborhood vigilante groups to the suspension of commercial air flights in and out of the country. This is the 1st urban Ebola outbreak in the DRC, so the governmental and legal experience of other African Union countries -- in particular Nigeria, which quelled potentially calamitous small urban outbreaks during the 2014-15 West African epidemic -- may be helpful here.

If the Ebola treatment unit (ETU) is a ward or wing of a fixed hospital building equipped with electrical power, there may be other ways to facilitate communication and contact between patients and their loved ones. For example, the ETU established in the Jui Hospital outside of Freetown in late 2014-2015 by the Sierra Leone MOH and Chinese Beijing 301 Hospital teams was equipped with closed circuit TV monitors and 2-way speakers, permitting patients and staff to communicate with each other at all times, without requiring entry into the high-risk zone wearing PPE (personal protective equipment). - Mod.LXL]

23 May 2018. WHO says 9 nations mobilize to prevent possible Ebola spread
Lemon Wire, Associated press (AP) [edited] https://www.lemonwire.com/2018/05/23/who-says-9-nations-mobilize-to-prevent-possible-ebola-spread/

The World Health Organization's regional director for Africa says the agency is accelerating efforts with 9 countries neighboring Congo to try to prevent the spread of the current Ebola outbreak beyond its borders.

Matshidiso Moeti says teams are being deployed to assess preparedness and "immediate next steps" include boosting capacity-building, training, and resource mobilization.

The top 2 priority countries are Central African Republic and the Republic of Congo, near the epicenter of the outbreak. In the Republic of Congo, for example, WHO is working with government officials "to stop functioning" an active market on its side of the Congo River.

Moeti told a World Health Assembly session [Wed 23 May 2018], the 9 countries "have already initiated their readiness activities." The others are Angola, Burundi, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania and Zambia.

[4] Ebola vaccine: real-world challenges
STAT [edited] https://www.statnews.com/2018/05/23/ebola-vaccine-drc-real-world-challenges/ [Byline: Helen Branswell]
Excitement over use of Ebola vaccine in outbreak tempered by real-world challenges

... "There is a danger that vaccines get seen as the holy grail," [Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, a public-private partnership that assists developing countries with immunization programs] told STAT. "That is a problem because the main thing that's going to control this epidemic is the traditional way of dealing with Ebola. And that's getting the epidemiology under control, understanding what the contacts are, getting isolation, safe burial -- all those things."

"I'm a great fan of vaccines. We need to get them out," continued Berkley. "But they rely on those other things, and we need to make sure that both are going in parallel."

The vaccination effort started [Mon 21 May 2018] with immunizing health care workers in Mbandaka, the capital of Equateur, the province where the outbreak is taking place. There are more than 7500 doses of the vaccine, made by Merck, on the ground already, and the company has been asked by the World Health Organization to send another 8600, a Merck spokesperson said.

In an interview posted on Twitter on [Tue 22 May 2018], Dr Peter Salama, the World Health Organization's deputy director-general for emergency preparedness and response, said the hope is that roughly 1000 people will be vaccinated over the next week. "We're really on an epidemiological knife-edge here," Salama told Devex, a media platform for the international development community. He said the discovery of a number of cases in Wangata, a district within Mbandaka, changed the WHO's estimate of the threat posed by this outbreak. The vaccine was tested at the tail end of the 2013-2016 West African outbreak, in a ring vaccination trial. The ensuing study declared that the vaccine was 100 percent effective; there were no infections among people who received the vaccine at least 10 days earlier.

Those findings give people hope this vaccine will help control Ebola outbreaks. But the 100 percent effective figure from the Guinea trial will create high expectations that paradoxically could work against the vaccine in the real world.

Vaccinators will need to carefully explain that some people who receive the vaccine may still get sick because protection is not immediate or because some of them may already have been infected when they were vaccinated, Berkley said. Otherwise, people may assume the vaccine doesn't work, or, worse, may wrongly conclude the vaccine can cause Ebola. Those kinds of rumors could profoundly affect people's willingness to be vaccinated.

Likewise, health workers -- a key population being targeted by this campaign -- need to understand that they can't let their guard down when it comes to treating Ebola patients, he said. "You want health workers to continue to use maximum precautions regardless of whether they're vaccinated or not."

In the real world, no vaccine is 100 percent effective. And while this vaccine appears to generate a rapid immune response, it is not immediate.

"One of the challenges is making sure that those messages are really heard and understood in both the health community ... and then certainly in the more general community," Berkley said.

Another risk: No one knows how long protection with this vaccine lasts. A recent study reported the protection may last as long as two years in some people, but the reality is only about 16 000 people in total have ever been vaccinated with this product, and most of those vaccinations occurred within the last 2-3 years.

Another communication challenge Berkley foresees stems from the fact that the vaccination effort is not a mass vaccination campaign. There is no attempt -- and no need -- at this point to try to vaccinate everyone. He's concerned the "worried well" will show up demanding a shot. Said Berkley: "So the idea that there is only a subset of people who are going to get it is complicated. And people don't understand that. And so education is going to be very important."

Still another challenge will be the fact that the vaccine is what is called "reactogenic." As it activates the immune system, people can feel ill and even develop a fever. In the middle of an outbreak, people who have been in contact with Ebola cases and who develop a fever could be mistaken for Ebola patients themselves.

During the vaccine trial in Guinea, people who received vaccine were given acetaminophen or other over-the-counter drugs used to lower fever. And that is part of the plan in DRC, Berkley said. "And obviously if somebody doesn't get better or the fever gets worse, then they will be triaged in a different way."
