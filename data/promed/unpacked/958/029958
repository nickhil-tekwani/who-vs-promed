Numbers of infected hogs increase
---------------------------------
The number of pigs in Eastern Visayas that contracted diseases since last
January [2009] rose to nearly 1000 with about 250 deaths, after 178 new
cases of infected hogs were reported during a meeting [in Tacloban City] on
Monday [9 Feb 2009].

Leo Caneda, regional executive director of the Department of Agriculture
(DA), earlier disclosed that in late January [2009], nearly 700 pigs from
the villages of Sta Rita, Samar, 60 from Daram, also in Samar, and 25 from
3 villages of Babatngon, Leyte were suspected of being infected with
salmonella.

Dr Andrew Orais, DA-Region 8 livestock coordinator, said his office has
received reports of the additional cases through phone calls and text
messages of hog disease occurrences in several other towns in Leyte, but
most of these are yet to be verified.

"We do not know yet if these diseases were caused by salmonella, PRRS
(porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome), or hog cholera [classical
swine fever]," he said during the meeting, adding that there has been no
definite result yet from the laboratory.

Dr Jose Luis Acompanado, provincial veterinarian of Northern Samar, said
137 cases of disease occurrence on pigs with 77 deaths due to suspected
bacterial infection were reported in 3 barangays (villages) of Lope de Vega
town in Northern Samar early February [2009].

Acompanado said they conducted an animal health mission and information
drive in barangays Getigo, Poblacion, and Hibunawan on 5 Feb 2009 while the
local government of Lope de Vega had set up checkpoints to prevent the
spread of the disease.
