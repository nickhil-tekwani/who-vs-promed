A young woman passed away on Sunday afternoon [6 Sep 2009] in Sanglah
Central Hospital after being treated for rabies symptoms from last
Thursday [3 Sep 2009].

She was a 21-year-old resident of Buahan village, Tabanan Regency,
Bali. Ironically, she was the daughter-in-law of a deceased man, who
died in late August 2009 after displaying similar symptoms. He was
the 1st rabies victim from Tabanan, a Regency that hasn't been
declared a rabies epidemic area. So far, only Badung and Denpasar
have been officially named as epidemic areas, thus receiving all the
necessary medical support related to anti-rabies measures.

The woman's grieving 22-year-old husband said his wife was bitten by
a stray dog in early August 2009. Unfortunately, not until 15 days
after the incident took place did his wife receive an anti-rabies
vaccine (VAR) injection. "After she was bitten by the dog, we rushed
her to Tabanan Regional Hospital. Yet, the medical personnel there
only stitched her wound and didn't give her the VAR," he said.
Subsequently, during her treatment at the hospital, his wife was
inoculated with VAR twice, but the inoculations failed to save her.
"Her condition was already severe when she was admitted to the
hospital," said Raka Sudewi, the attending physician. "She couldn't
move both her legs, she was restless and displayed a phobia of water;
all are classic symptoms of rabies," he added.

He said that a sample from the woman would be sent to the laboratory
to confirm or deny the presence of the rabies virus. At least 9
people have died in the resort island of Bali due to suspected rabies
infections since late last year [2008].

[The island of Bali is divided into 8 regencies (Badung, Gianyar,
Tabanan, Bangli, Karangasem, Jembrana, Buleleng and Klungkung, and
one municipal city (Denpasar); see <http://www.2indonesia.com/regency.html>.
Three of these, Badung, Denpasar and now Tabanan, all adjacent, must
now be considered confirmed or probable rabies epidemic areas. Little
progress appears to have been achieved in containing the outbreak.
The preceding report highlights the inadequacies of the local
healthcare systems.

Confirmation or otherwise of the diagnosis of rabies virus infection
in the case of the Tabanan patient should be disclosed as soon as it
becomes available, and, in addition, whatever information is
available currently concerning the level of rabies virus infection in
dogs in Tabanan should be made public.

Tourists to the island should be aware of the risks and take
appropriate measures for their own protection. - Mod.CP]
