Antibodies against Schmallenberg virus detected in cattle in Denmark
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The National Veterinary Institute has found antibodies against Schmallenberg virus [SBV] in samples from 2 cattle in southern Jutland. This is the 1st infection with this new virus found in Danish livestock.

The 2 cattle originating from the same herd in southern Jutland have been subjected to SBV infection that has spread in Europe since the summer of 2011. This is shown in a survey for antibodies made by the National Veterinary Institute.

"This is the 1st finding that livestock in Denmark has been infected with Schmallenberg virus," says Anette Botner, a veterinarian, head of Section for Exotic Viral Diseases at the National Veterinary Institute.

The antibodies produced by the immune system can be traced in the blood for months after an infection with SBV, and the 2 cattle were probably infected in the autumn [2011] by small mosquitoes or midges.

It will be interesting to note which test has been applied and if the 2 cattle (or their progeny) have suffered any health problems.

Earlier, Danish scientists recorded SBV-infected _culicoides obsoletus_, trapped during Oct 2011 in the same region of South Jutland, adjacent to the German border (20120313.1068612). A scientific publication of the finding was cited in item 2 of posting 20120521.1139793. - Mod.AS.
