[Now that the West Nile virus (WNV) surveillance data reported to CDC
through ArboNET are appearing weekly in MMWR (see part 7 below),
ProMED-mail will no longer provide abstracted information from the USGS
West Nile virus maps. A summary map of the current situation is reproduced
in MMWR, and the more detailed USGS maps, down to county level in some
categories, can be accessed via:
<http://westnilemaps.usgs.gov>.
Now that the 2003 West Nile virus season is in full swing, only extensions
of West Nile virus geographic range or host species, and exceptional items,
will be posted separately from these weekly updates. - Mod.CP]

Louisiana: WNV Update from the Office of the State Veterinarian
---------------------------------------------------
West Nile virus (WNV) has been found in 3 horses in Caddo and Lafourche
Parishes. These are the first 3 that have been confirmed positive by the
laboratory.
I would like to remind veterinarians that this is a reportable disease (to
our office) when you FIRST suspect WNV or any other encephalitis as a
differential. Test the suspect horses, call, email or fax our office to
report the suspect case, and submit blood work to the laboratory. We are
part of the state and nationwide data base now. I have to forward all
known cases to several people within the state and the USA.
Important information that I need is the following: Name of owner, Address
of owner, City and Zip code, Name of Horse, Breed, Sex, Age, Address of
Horse, location, City, Parish, Zip code, vaccination status, Any other
pertinent data or comments. Please help us by collecting as many of these
data as possible! Nationwide, from the meetings I attended at AVMA
meeting, this data is very much needed.

Florida: First 2 Human Cases of West Nile Virus Infection in 2003
---------------------------------------------------------
West Nile virus has been detected in 2 Florida residents, marking the
state's first human cases of the deadly mosquito-borne virus in 2003. A
76-year-old Marco Island man and an 85-year-old Panhandle woman have been
diagnosed with the virus, health officials said Thu 24 Jul 2003.
State health officials placed Collier County under a medical alert, urging
people (especially those older than 50 with weakened immune systems) to
take extra precautions to avoid getting bitten. The alert also allows the
state to spray insecticide if necessary. Officials in Okaloosa County said
the woman diagnosed there was recovering at home. The 2 cases come early in
the rainy season, when the freshwater mosquito that carries the virus thrives.
The Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta has reported 12 human cases of
West Nile so far in 2003 in 8 states, numbers that do not include the 2
Florida cases. In 2002, more than 4000 people in the United States had
symptoms of the virus, and 284 died. Hardest hit was Illinois, with 884
cases and 64 deaths. Florida had 28 cases and 2 deaths last year.

Florida: Another Blood Donor Tests West Nile Virus-Positive
--------------------------------------------------
State health officials confirmed the first human case of West Nile virus
contracted in Brevard County on Mon 28 Jul 2003. The confirmation came one
week after the Central Florida Blood Bank [detected West Nile virus nucleic
acid] in the donated blood of a 36-year-old Rockledge man.
Health officials plan to take another blood sample from the Rockledge man
in a few weeks to make sure he has fully recovered from the viral
infection. He was thought to have been infected by the virus, which is
spread by mosquitoes, while outside on the 4th of July. The man recovered
from a brief illness by the time he gave blood on 15 Jul 2003 at the blood
bank's Rockledge branch. The health department is also testing another
positive [test result] for West Nile virus that the blood bank reported
late last week in a 40-year-old Stuart donor. The blood bank found the 2
men's infected samples among 15 000 donations it has tested since 30 Jun
2003, using a new machine that identifies [viral nucleic acid]. The Stuart
man, who suffered no significant illness, was working outside in the
Rockledge area between late May and early July; he gave blood on 6 Jul 2003.
There have been no medical alerts in Brevard in 2003 for mosquito-borne
illnesses. But state health officials issued alerts for West Nile virus
infection for 2 counties earlier in July after an 85-year-old female in
Okaloosa County and a 75-year-old male in Collier County contracted the
disease. Both are recovering.
In 2002, West Nile virus killed 284 of 4156 people infected in America. 2
of 28 people infected in Florida died.

Nebraska: 2 suspected Cases of West Nile Virus Infection (One Imported)
-------------------------------------------------
2 suspected [human] cases of West Nile virus infection have been reported
by local health officials in Nebraska. A 63-year-old Fremont man has been
confirmed to have contracted the virus by the Three Rivers Public Health
Department. And preliminary tests show that a 19-year-old Lincoln woman
could have West Nile virus infection, said Tim Timmons of the
Lincoln-Lancaster County Health Department. Neither case has been confirmed
by the state Health and Human Services System. Spokesman Bill Wiley said
the system is awaiting confirmation from the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention in Atlanta.
The Lincoln woman, a Nebraska Wesleyan University student, became ill last
week. She reported that she had been bitten by mosquitos while on a July
4th boating trip in northern Kansas and is recovering.
In 2002, there were 174 known cases in people in 48 of Nebraska's 93
counties. Most of those cases were in July, August, and September. 8 people
have died from the virus in Nebraska so far in 2003 [sic: should read 2002.
There have been zero human cases reported so far from Nebraska in 2003, see:
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/surv&controlCaseCount03.htm>.
CDC human totals for Nebraska for 2002, updated as of 7 Jul this year, 2003,
are 152 cases & 7 deaths, see:
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/surv&controlCaseCount02.htm>. -

Colorado: 13 More Cases of West Nile Virus Infection Confirmed
---------------------------------------------------
13 more cases of West Nile virus infection have been confirmed in humans in
Colorado, and many more are expected as the exotic disease takes hold,
state health officials said on Wed 30 Jul 2003. The latest human cases
bring the total to 18, with 10 more suspected cases. The disease has been
found in humans in 12 counties on the Eastern Plains and along the Front
Range. West Nile first appeared in in the state in 2002, infecting 13
people. None of the Colorado cases has been fatal.
Dr. Ned Calonge, the state's chief medical officer, said the number of West
Nile cases will rise but other diseases, such as [influenza], affect more
people, he said. Influenza kills about 800 Coloradans each year. Calonge
said that the number of West Nile virus cases is expected to decline after
the disease has been in the state a few years.

New Mexico: First Human Case of West Nile Virus Infection
---------------------------------------------------
A Valencia County woman is the first human case of West Nile virus
infection in New Mexico. Until now, only horses and birds had been infected
with the virus there. The woman had not traveled outside of New
Mexico, so that means she was bitten by infected mosquitoes in this state.
She was seen by her physician with symptoms of fever, headache, and a rash.
She did not develop meningitis, which can be fatal.
The state health department says residents of Valencia County, as well as
all New Mexicans, are encouraged to take precautionary steps to avoid
mosquito bites. In the meantime, the state has set up surveillance sites
around the state to check for West Nile virus.
So far in 2003, West Nile virus has been found in a horse in Sierra County,
a horse in Chavez County and a golden eagle in Santa Fe County.
