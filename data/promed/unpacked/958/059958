Sudanese Refugees Spreading Sleeping Sickness in West Nile Region
------------------------------------------------------------
The high influx of Sudanese refugees into West Nile has accelerated the
outbreak of sleeping sickness in the region, Moyo district sleeping
sickness coordinator, Dr. Nicholas Ogweng, has said.
Ogweng revealed this yesterday during a four-day joint consultative
workshop organized by the ministry of Health and Medicines Sans Frontiers
at Fairway Hotel in Kampala. He disclosed that Ugandans make up only 29
percent, while the Sudanese constitute 71 percent of all sleeping sickness
cases recorded in Moyo, Arua, Adjumani and Soroti districts.
"There are many Sudanese crossing into the country and many have been
treated at various centers in Moyo district," Ogweng said. The Assistant
Commissioner of Health Services, Vector Control Department of the ministry
of Health, Dr. Dawson Mbuhamberi, said the refugee influx poses a difficult
problem for the government due to their uncoordinated movement within and
outside West Nile.
"We don't have the mandate to cross borders but we have tried to meet with
officials on both sides of the border to put up some form of restrictions,
but with the war in Southern Sudan, it becomes a very complicated issue,"
he said.
Statistics indicate that 13 534 people have been screened for the disease
between January 2000 and March 2001. Of these, 337 cases of sleeping
sickness were identified in 19 villages in Moyo district and treated at the
district hospital.
At the workshop, fears were also raised about an eminent fresh outbreak of
the disease in Kamuli district. Dr. Mbuhamberi said several cases had been
recorded in Namwenda sub-county, Buzaaya county in Kamuli, where the tsetse
fly population in the area stands at a density of 5 flies per trap per
day. A corresponding increase in the number of cases of sleeping sickness
was similarly noted.
Dr. Mbuhamberi said records at Bulopa sleeping sickness treatment center
show that 31 cases of the disease have been recorded since the beginning of
this year, while 81 cases were recorded last year.
58 cases were recorded in 1998 and 62 in 1999. Other districts where cases
of sleeping sickness have been recorded include Bugiri, Tororo, Mbale,
Iganga, Busia, Pallisa and Jinja.
The disease is transmitted by tsetse flies and is mainly prevalent in rural
areas on lakeshores. Currently, treatment of the disease is being
undertaken by Medicines Sans Frontiers France, a Paris-based medical NGO,
which started operating in Uganda in 1987.
Meanwhile, about 3000 ampoules of Melarsoprol (Mel B), which are due to
expire in June this year, are to be distributed to the affected districts
to help fight the outbreak.

[This report fits in with the increased activity of sleeping sickness
reported in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Angola, where civil war
and break down of the infrastructure of the health services have resulted
in the emergence of sleeping sickness. The report also underlines that the
reports of sleeping sickness in tourists visiting game parks in western
Tanzania may contribute to the emergence of sleeping sickness in central
Africa as a whole. - Mod.EP
