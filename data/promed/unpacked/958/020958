Antelope hunters warned of disease outbreak
----------------------
About 1300 Montana antelope hunters will soon receive a postcard from
the state's wildlife agency warning that they may need to limit their
expectations for Sunday's [7 Oct 2007] opening of the pronghorn
season due to a disease outbreak.
The postcards were mailed Monday by [1 Oct 2007] Montana Fish,
Wildlife and Parks to all either-sex antelope license holders for
Hunting District 530 in the wake of a severe case of bluetongue in an
area that stretches from Roundup to Melstone and north of the
Musselshell River.
While many parts of Eastern Montana appear to have suffered antelope
and white-tailed deer deaths due to bluetongue in recent months,
Hunting District 530 appears to have been hit the worst.
"HD 530 has been hit pretty hard," said Jay Newell, FWP wildlife
biologist at Roundup. "After recent flights, I figure 29 percent of
the antelope have died since July [2007]. It is starting to lessen.
The last sick deer I heard about was about a week ago. I haven't had
any reports since then. We have had a couple of frosts."
Bluetongue is typically a livestock disease that can hit sheep
particularly hard -- and sheep have been killed throughout the area,
too. The disease is transmitted by a biting midge or gnat carrying
the disease from one animal to the next.
Fish, Wildlife and Parks has received results from the testing of 2
antelope and 3 whitetails and all showed positive for bluetongue --
not the closely related EHD (epizootic hemorrhagic disease) that
typically hits whitetails and is transmitted by the same insect. The
disease usually disappears with the 1st hard frosts, which kill the
biting midges and gnats.
While other areas haven't been hit as hard by bluetongue as Hunting
District 530, the disease has killed antelope over a wide area of
Eastern Montana this year [2007].
Newell said he has fielded reports of dead antelope from north of
Hardin, south of Huntley, the Rapelje area, Broadview, Comanche and
Ingomar. Whitetails were infected on the Musseshell River from near
Delphia to Melstone and on to Mosby.
Bernie Hildebrand, FWP wildlife biologist at Miles City, said
whitetails were killed along the Yellowstone River from Miles City westward.
"We have a fair amount of it on antelope in the western part of
Region 7 in Treasure and Rosebud counties," Hildebrand said. "There
is some up in Garfield County on the west edge of the county. I did
some flying on the east edge and there was nothing of the disease there."
"We've had a couple of pretty severe frosts in Garfield County. We
haven't had those frosts here (at Miles City), so we may still be
having deaths along the Yellowstone River," Hildebrand added. "We've
got a fairly substantial number of whitetail deaths on the
Yellowstone. I suspect hunters are going to see dead animals -- both
antelope and whitetails -- especially in the area 20 to 30 miles
north of the Yellowstone in Region 7 and on the Musselshell."
Billings regional wildlife manager Ray Muli said the department sent
out the postcards simply to alert hunters to the fact that they may
not see as many live animals as usual while seeing more dead ones
than they normally see.
"The big thing is that there's no threat to humans either from
contact with sick animals or eating the meat of sick animals," Muli
said. "There are some real hotspot areas where they may notice fewer animals."
Montana's general antelope season opens across the state at a
half-hour before sunrise on Sunday [7 Oct 2007]. Most hunters
received their licenses in August [2007] through computer drawings
with the remainder purchasing over-the-counter surplus licenses since then.

North America has only one native species commonly referred to as an
"antelope." It the only surviving species of its taxonomic Family and
Genus: Antilocapridae: _Antilocapra Americana_. It is entirely
outside the group of animals to which ProMED readers were referred in
the previous posting. The accepted English name of the species in
question is "Pronghorn," but it often also is called "pronghorned
antelope" or "antelope" in lay publications.

Montana has had bluetongue in sheep this year. The recent frosts
should help the situation as the disease is transmitted by biting
insects which the frost should kill off.
Of course Mr. Leighton is correct for which this moderator apologizes
