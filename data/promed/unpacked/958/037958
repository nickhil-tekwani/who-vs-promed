MANGO TREE BLIGHT - BRAZIL

The local papers here are full of pictures of a blight killing mature mango
trees.
Mangoes appear on Harlan's list of 30 major crops that nourish humans, with
a global annual production estimated at 10 million metric tonnes in the
mid-1970s -- see ref. above.
Can any of our readers tell us what the pathogen is, and what is being done
to combat it?
