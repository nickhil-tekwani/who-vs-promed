The Florida State Health Office, the Okaloosa County Public Health Unit, the
US Air Force, the Okaloosa County Public Schools and local EMS units are
cooperating in a campaign to provide multivalent meningococcal polysaccharide
vaccine to approximately 5000 children residing in one area Fort Walton Beach,
Florida.
There have been seven confirmed cases of Neisseria meningitidis invasive
disease since the first of the year. Two have been group B, one group Y, and
four group C. An additional possible case is under investigation. Two of the
group C cases were in children in the same elementary school, with onset dates
two days apart.
The target group is children two years of age through 8th grade, living in
Fort Walton Beach south of Cinco Bayou and Gap Creek, and west from Brooks
Bridge to Hurlbut Field. The majority of children in this area are US Air
Force dependents.
On Saturday clinics will provide vaccine for preschool children; vaccine will
be provided for school-age children through the schools starting on Monday.
After next Friday proof of immunization will be required for school
attendance.
Information is available through the Okaloosa CPHU at 904-833-9244 or through
the state epidemiology office at 904-488-2905.
