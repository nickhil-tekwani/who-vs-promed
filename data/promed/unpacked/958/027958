Dead fish mixed with tar balls wash up along the beaches in Pensacola,
Florida. Laughing gulls fall from the sky along the Mississippi River
in Empire, Louisiana. A posted photo shows a small hammerhead shark
lying on a beach near Gulf Shores, Alabama, streaked with oil.

In the last week [21-28 Jul 2010], Gulf Coast residents continued to
post findings of injured and dead wildlife washed ashore, even as
Louisiana reopened certain waters to sports fishing and Alabama
reopened parts of Mobile Bay to shrimping.

"Laughing gulls on 3 separate occasions have been spotted on LA 23
falling from the sky dead," read the report out of Empire, La.

Thousands of gallons of oil have spilled in West Michigan [on the
Kalamazoo River] after a pipeline break.

With every spill comes heartbreaking images of animals covered in oil,
unable to clean themselves off, and dying from the toxic oil.

Several local volunteers teamed up on Tuesday [27 Jul 2010] to save as
many of them as possible. They met to do some clean up work near the
site of the spill, which has already proven disastrous to local
wildlife.

"Geese, ducks, fish, turtles, it runs the gamut," said Tom Tidwell, US
Department of Fish and Wildlife.

The 800 000 gallons plus of oil is taking a heavy toll. Newschannel 3
saw a muskrat covered in oil on the banks of the river, its chance of
survival is slim.

Enbridge Energy, the company that owns the pipeline that spilled, is
working with several groups including Focus Wildlife and the US
Department of Fish and Wildlife to clean up animals affected by the
spill.

Fish and Wildlife says it have over 60 calls out for specific areas
where wildlife has been tainted by the spill. Public concern has many
volunteer groups stepping in to help. "We have to do something about
this, this is the hand we were dealt," said Matt Davis, one of the
founders of a new Facebook group called Kalamazoo River Oil Spill
Animal Wildlife Rescue. Around 20 volunteers gathered at a local creek
on Tuesday [27 Jul 2010] and went to work cleaning up wildlife.

While pictures of animals covered in oil may be hard to handle,
experts say handling animals without proper training is not only
dangerous, in many cases it's against the law. "It could be very
dangerous if you are not trained, you could literally lose an eye,"
said Tidwell. "We're not trying to bring down the hammer on people who
think they are doing the right thing. Keep in mind before picking up
wildlife, it may not be legal. Not just wildlife, but state protected
wildlife."

Officials are stressing that anyone who sees an animal, either dead or
alive, that has been affected by the spill, should not touch it, and
leave it for the professionals to take care of.

If oil comes onto your property, dispatchers ask that you do NOT call
911 unless it's an emergency.

Enbridge Energy has set up a hotline for people who have spotted
injured wildlife, or if you have any questions or concerns. That
number is 1-800-306-6837.

There is an update (30 Jul 2010) addressing human health issues at
<http://www.wwmt.com/articles/health-1379640-levels-spill.html>.
- Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]

[The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has done numerous tests on the
fish, shrimp and other food sources from the gulf. Multitudes of tests
have proven the marine food source to be safe for human consumption.

There is a difference in the edible marine life being safe for
consumption and the [safety of] birds and marine mammals coming up or
landing in the heavy crude oil that may be in the area.

The Michigan spill is much more recent than the gulf spill, and the
layer of oil does not have quite the ability to disperse in a short
time.

Oil can be toxic to humans and animals and proper training for
cleaning the animals is necessary for appropriate handling of the
animals and protection of each worker. - Mod.TG]
