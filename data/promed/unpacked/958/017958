[Colorado] Parks officials have determined that botulism has been killing ducks in a pond in Aurora. The naturally-occurring bacteria is spread through insects. Visitors to Exposition Park started seeing the dead birds last week [week of 29 Aug 2016]. They are concerned about the level of pollution in the ponds and how it affects the health of residents living near the park.

The City of Aurora periodically tests the water in the park and said there has not been an increase in toxins.

[Avian botulism is a paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin produced by the bacteria _Clostridium botulinum_. These bacteria are widespread in soil and require warm temperatures, a protein source, and an anaerobic (no oxygen) environment in order to become active and produce toxin.

There are several types of toxin produced by strains of this bacterium; birds are most commonly affected by type C and to a lesser extent type E. Type C toxin is found in waterfowl, shorebirds, colonial waterbirds, and others; whereas type E toxin is found in gulls, loons, and others. - Mod.PMB
