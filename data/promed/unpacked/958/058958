Jumbo dies of anthrax?
----------------------
A 17-year-old cow elephant was found dead allegedly due to anthrax in Kurangupallam, Vadavalli in Kuthialathur reserve forest, Sathy, on Sunday [27 May 2012]. Locals informed the forest officials that a carcass of a elephant was found in the Kuthialathur reserve forest area.

The conservator of forest, D Arun, and Sathy Divisional Forest Officer, D Sathish, visited the spot with forest veterinarian Dr Manoharan. In the autopsy, the officials found that the animal [had] died due to anthrax.

The officials are planning to hold anthrax vaccination to the cattle in villages adjacent to the forest area in coordination with animal husbandry department as part of the efforts to prevent spread of this disease to cattle grazing within the forest area and to wild animals, sources said.

[We should remember that this is still suspected anthrax. It has yet to be confirmed.

Though elephants do graze it is not unlikely that this elephant got ill from bites from tabanid flies that had previously fed on another animal that was sick or dead from anthrax, or from browsing on leaves contaminated by vomiting blow flies. This doubles the urgency in getting the villagers' livestock vaccinated. One should always keep in mind that whatever such villagers may claim, it is usual to find that they have been grazing their animals inside any adjoining wildlife park.
