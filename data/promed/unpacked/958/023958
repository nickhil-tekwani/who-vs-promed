Some central Kentucky counties are continuing to see an upswing in hepatitis A cases. One of those counties is Fayette County. The Lexington-Fayette County Health Department says it has seen more than 85 cases in November and December 2018 alone, bringing the total to 124.

"I think it's finally just reached more momentum here in Lexington, especially among high-risk groups," commissioner of health Kraig Humbaugh said. "So 75% to 80% of our cases are folks who use substances, but we have to remind people that 10% to 15% of the cases here in Lexington, we don't know of any risk factors."

The state numbers are showing no signs of slowing down either. There are now more than 3200 cases as of mid-December 2018. More than 20 have died as a result.

Experts are urging the public to get vaccinated and to practice proper handwashing. To have full immunity, you should get 2 shots. The 2nd dose is given at least 6 months after the 1st one. Only 90% of people are protected against the virus after the 1st shot.

There are now 166 people in Nashville, Tennessee, who have contracted hepatitis A. That brings the state total to 636 confirmed cases. That is an increase from the numbers last released on 19 Dec 2018, which were 161 confirmed cases in Nashville and 597 cases statewide. The outbreak began in December 2017; 2 people have died. The increase comes while state and local health departments are working to contain and end Tennessee's hepatitis A outbreak.

"If you look at those who are at risk that includes people who use drugs and [are] homeless. Those 2 populations can end up in the jail system," said Metro Nashville Health Department spokesman Brian Todd. "[We] focus on them and work with the Sheriff's office to offer the [vaccination] to all inmates when they enter the system." The health department cannot force people to get the vaccine.

In Nashville, health officials usually see one or 2 cases of hepatitis A per year. Right now, they are seeing 2 cases per week. That number is down from the peak during summer 2018, when the health department reported about 10 confirmed cases of the virus each week. Todd says the number may peak again because it can take up to 12 months to end a hepatitis A outbreak.

"We're going to continue to focus on those at-risk groups and being able to reach those at-risk groups with the vaccine," said Todd. "We're also putting out messages about how to stop the spread, that includes handwashing to remove the germs that may cause someone to be sick."

Drug users and men who have sex with men are also at risk. The Nashville Health Department has been out to various LGBTQ nightclubs where nurses will set up inside and offer vaccinations.

Hepatitis A spreads from human waste. That's why it's crucial to wash your hands after you go to the bathroom.

It is now a requirement that children be vaccinated for hepatitis A before they go to school. That is a semi-recent development. Current 21-year-olds are among the 1st group who were vaccinated as infants.

A spokesperson for Ballad Health said on Thursday [3 Jan 2019] that 3 staff members at Indian Path Community Hospital in Kingsport, Tennessee have been infected with hepatitis A. Ballad Health officials became aware this week of the situation, a news release said.

"The risk of transmission is low, but out of an abundance of caution, we are providing vaccination for all team members at Indian Path," the release said. "We have been in close contact with the health department, and we are working closely with them to notify and offer vaccination to other individuals who have had contact as well."

The Tennessee Department of Health is reporting an increase of acute hepatitis A cases statewide since December 2017 as a result of an ongoing national outbreak. "While Tennessee typically averages 4-5 acute hepatitis A cases per year, since 1 Dec 2017, the state has reported 647 cases," the release says. "[Of those cases, 15] were reported in our region."

[The specifics of the timing of these cases and what positions those infected held at the healthcare facility are not stated. The individuals could have been infected related to patient contact (although the peak time for fecal-oral transmission of hepatitis A virus is before overt illness) or even from food in the hospital cafeteria (from an asymptomatic infected food handler), or some or all of the cases could have been acquired outside the facility. - Mod.LL]

K.H. knew she had a problem when her eyes turned the color of traffic paint. She had been feeling strangely tired, but she didn't have many opportunities to look at herself in a mirror because she'd been homeless for a few months. Her fiance noticed her yellow eyes and freaked out. And that's how she knew she had caught the disease so many of her friends already had: hepatitis A.

Hepatitis A, a vaccine-preventable disease that attacks the liver and is spread by contaminated fecal matter, is a scourge in developing nations with poor sanitation systems. Imported contaminated food is typically to blame when the disease occurs in developed countries. But US cases of the disease have tripled in 2018, and the outbreak has nothing to do with imported food.

Hepatitis A is spreading among drug-using and homeless populations, with explosions of the disease moving from California to states such as Kentucky, West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana and Missouri. The toll has been vast: At least 10 582 people have been reported infected so far this year [2018] alone, a large number of whom have required extensive, and thus expensive, hospitalizations. Hepatitis A inflicts what feel like severe flu symptoms: nausea, fever, dizziness, overall lethargy and jaundice. Without treatment, severe cases of hepatitis A can cause liver failure. At least 80 people have died from this outbreak.

States, counties and cities have spent millions to fight their local outbreaks, but the money doesn't address the root causes of the problem: a decaying public health infrastructure, devastated by years of funding cuts, that can't fully meet the needs of a population driven to homelessness and devastated by the opioid epidemic. "Unfortunately, I see this hepatitis A outbreak as a symptom of the fraying social safety net," said Dr. Jeff Duchin, a public health officer for Seattle and King County, Washington.

Before 1995, when the hepatitis A vaccine was 1st licensed in the USA, about 21 000 Americans were diagnosed with hepatitis A each year, according to the CDC. In 2006, the CDC recommended all children be vaccinated, and many states now require that children get the vaccine before attending school. The release of the vaccine and the spread of immunization caused the number of new cases of the disease to plummet. For the first 2 decades after the arrival of the vaccine, most outbreaks of hepatitis A in the USA were connected to imported contaminated food sources, like the 2016 outbreak due to frozen strawberries or the 2013 outbreak from pomegranate seeds. On a much smaller scale, the USA has also previously seen surges in cases among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men.

So when San Diego County in California saw a spike in hepatitis A cases starting in late 2016 and there didn't appear to be an underlying food source, the county was caught by surprise. The county health department discovered the disease was spreading through unsanitary living conditions in tent cities and among drug users who were too old to have been vaccinated before attending school. During the peak of the outbreak that fall, the county sprayed its streets with bleach. The health department launched a massive vaccination campaign, added handwashing stations and new bathrooms, and handed out bags that people could use to dispose of their waste if they didn't have regular access to a bathroom.

By the time San Diego quelled the outbreak at the start of 2018, nearly 600 people had been infected and 20 had died. It was just the beginning. The San Diego strain of hepatitis A began to pop up nationwide at the end of 2017 and the beginning of 2018, in Utah and then in Kentucky, Indiana and West Virginia. Michigan saw an explosion of a different strain of the disease. Indiana soon took the drastic step of issuing a travel advisory, suggesting that its residents get vaccinated this spring [2018] before heading to Louisville for the Kentucky Derby because of the growing outbreak there.

"Disease doesn't recognize borders when there are outbreaks in neighboring states," said Pam Pontones, Indiana's deputy state health commissioner and state epidemiologist.

As it continued to move east, the disease spread primarily through the drug-using population. Unsanitary and sometimes transient conditions associated with drug use put that population at risk for exposure to contaminated fecal matter, health departments say. There is also some evidence to suggest a possible connection between the disease and intravenous drug use, according to Dr. Sapna Bamrah Morris, who helps lead the CDC's response to hepatitis A.

"These are all the symptoms of the cost and human toll the opioid epidemic is taking," Rahul Gupta, who was head of the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources until November [2018], told HuffPost in September [2018]. "It's much more a telltale sign of the times we're in and the large epidemic, the tsunami of communicable disease that can happen."

What made these outbreaks difficult to stop, public health officials say, is that they were hurting the people who are hardest to reach: those who are homeless, transient or using drugs, and who don't trust the healthcare system after years of stigmatization. Public health departments had to partner with homeless shelters, soup kitchens and needle exchanges to find these cases of hepatitis A. They set up vaccine drives, deployed strike forces of nurses and staff across cities, sent out mobile vaccine units to far away rural areas. That all takes time and money and effort -- and the disease is still spreading.

"Reaching the at-risk populations that are currently affected is extremely resource intensive and everyone has limitations on the resources they have," said Dr. Morris from the CDC. Health departments also have "competing priorities," she said, like the onslaught of the influenza season.

Dr. Duchin put it a bit more bluntly. "If these large hepatitis A outbreaks were happening, for example, on college campuses, you'd probably see a different level of energy around getting resources mobilized to respond to them more comprehensively," he said.

The entire outbreak demonstrates how public health is failing people most in need of protection, said Jeffrey Howard, the commissioner of Kentucky's public health department. When the CDC finally issued an advisory to health departments nationwide in June 2018, cases were nearing 2000 for the year. Now there are closing in on 11 000.

"It is always clear that inequities and disparities in health and health outcomes exist -- and they exist across this country," Howard said. "We have to do a better job of protecting that vulnerable population and I think that's the responsibility of all of public health."

Yet all the while, hepatitis A has continued to spread despite health departments' efforts. And the problem gets worse as those outbreaks move from urban centers to more rural areas that have less public health infrastructure, Howard said. Kentucky and West Virginia have seen such a pattern and have the worst outbreaks to date with 3265 cases and 2137 cases, respectively. They're still seeing new cases every week.

"My guess is we're going to see a new status quo with hepatitis A," Howard said. "Hepatitis A is not going to be as rare a disease as it used to be in this country. It's probably going to be a new normal."

Officials point to declining public health funding to explain the explosion of this preventable disease. More than 56 000 local health department jobs were lost nationwide between 2008 and 2017, according to the National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO). In that time, STD rates have skyrocketed, the opioid crisis now claims more than 115 lives a day, and 80 000 people died of the influenza in 2017.

"As funding cuts happen all along over years, it's really the public health infrastructure that erodes," said Lilly Kan, the senior director for infectious disease and informatics at NACCHO. "It continues to be a smoldering issue, but then when you have fires like outbreaks like hepatitis A, then it becomes obvious."

Nowhere were the consequences of public health cuts more evident than in West Virginia, where K.H. contracted hepatitis A. The state instituted a 24% cut in state aid to public health departments in 2016, and several leadership positions remained unfilled as the outbreak spread across the state. "We've been able to manage, and counties that don't have our resources cannot," said Dr. Michael Kilkenny, the physician director at the Cabell-Huntington Health Department. "The state is overtaxed and is relying on the CDC." But the CDC, which has competing priorities and a limited budget, can only do so much.

Dr. Kilkenny told West Virginia Public Radio in 2016 that funding cuts "would really cripple" surveillance efforts for all sorts of diseases. "If we stop watching for those diseases, those diseases will spread, people will get sick and some of those people will die," he said at the time.

West Virginia's hepatitis A outbreak is now the 2nd-worst in the country. Of the more than 2000 West Virginians who have been diagnosed with the disease in 2018, 12 have died. Health departments across the state have lost key staff; the state currently has an interim commissioner of public health. The staffing issues are particularly dire in Kanawha County-Charleston -- the heart of the outbreak, with 782 cases to date. The chief of clinical services at the Kanawha-Charleston Health Department left in 2018, as did the chief of administration and the chief of health promotion and wellness, according to the former head of the department. In addition, 5 administrative assistants were let go due to budget cuts in 2017.

Dr. Michael Brumage, the former department head, departed in 2018 amid public backlash over a controversial needle exchange in Charleston that shut down in February 2018. And Brenda Isaac, the president of the county's health board, resigned in October 2018, saying she had become a "lightning rod" in the mayoral race, which was largely a referendum on the needle exchange. The interim head of the city's public health department is working part-time. "It was a really unfortunate set of circumstances that depleted the health department of resources right when they needed it most," said Brumage, who is now the assistant dean for public health practice and service at the West Virginia University School of Public Health. "Even under the best of circumstances it's difficult to recruit personnel as funding has been slashed over the years."

The Kanawha-Charleston Health Department didn't move fast enough to combat hepatitis because it was distracted by the fight over the needle exchange, said Dr. Angie Settle, the CEO and executive director of West Virginia Health Right, a free health care clinic in Charleston. The county didn't ramp up its efforts until new cases were peaking in the summer of 2018, added Ellen Allen, the executive director of Covenant House, a day shelter in downtown Charleston. Both organizations have played important roles in fighting the outbreak. "We requested the health department to come in February [2018], but we felt like we kept it too limited in scope," Allen said. "We should have gotten our arms around this in the spring."

The primary populations affected by the outbreak -- homeless people and drug users -- are served by Covenant House, which has seen a sharp uptick in people coming through the door as the West Virginia economy has struggled in recent years. Briana Martin, who manages the needs of people who drop in each day at Covenant House, knows at least 10 people in the day shelter who have been infected. She makes sure to wash her hands after interacting with people who have been exposed to hepatitis A. For those who haven't been vaccinated against the disease, all it would take to contract hepatitis A would be to shake hands with someone who has it or touch the bathroom door before eating. The health department has been handing out bags filled with wipes, a toothbrush, toothpaste, 2 water bottles, toilet paper, hand sanitizer, gloves, detailed sanitary instructions -- and a poop bag. Over 85 people at Covenant House had received the kits as of September [2018]. But sanitary problems persist. Allen said her staff often cleans up poop outside the shelter. She has requested more outdoor bathrooms, but nothing has changed -- and the shelter is only open 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.

It's just another sign that things continue to worsen for those without a safety net, according to Allen. "I've never seen anything like this," she said. "I've been in nonprofit work for 11 years now and just the last year the acceleration and the decrease in the well-being of people -- it's heartbreaking." Almost all of the 20 or so people at Covenant House one afternoon this September 2018 said they had heard of hepatitis A. Yellow signs with bold letters urging people to get vaccinated dotted the walls.

A Covenant House visitor sat outside the doors for a few hours before making his way in to tease the staff. But when asked about hepatitis A, he answered quickly. "I've seen people about to die of it -- wait till they're about to die before they go in," he said. "Isn't it a third-world disease?"

The financial costs of these outbreaks have been high, and they're still rising. San Diego County, California, estimates it spent $12.5 million to quell its outbreak, which is one-quarter the size of West Virginia's. Kentucky has allocated $2 million so far to the vaccine alone, which doesn't even count federal money. The underlying hospitalization costs are astronomical, which Brumage said ends up affecting both hospitals and taxpayers because so many members of the at-risk populations are uninsured. "Those are very extensive hospitalizations that itself would be several million," said Gupta, West Virginia's former public health commissioner.

This doesn't even begin to account for the other resources, such as time, that public health departments and community partnerships have put toward battling the outbreaks. And news of an outbreak can devastate a local economy. Popular fast-food restaurants in West Virginia have taken a massive hit, said Tri-State Restaurant Association spokesman Mike Kirtner. The organization was formed after Ohio, Kentucky and West Virginia saw hepatitis A cases take off. Hepatitis A cases have shut down several restaurants in the Charleston area in 2018, and Kirtner said one major chain lost 70% of its business in a single day after a case of hepatitis A was reported. Waitresses at affected restaurants have seen their tips decrease, Kirtner said, sometimes from as much as $300 a day to just $50.

Politicians, local TV news and the public have blamed just about everything except the lack of public health funding for the outbreak in West Virginia. "It all came from restaurants," Danny Jones, Charleston's outgoing mayor, told HuffPost. But none of the West Virginia cases have been traced to food contamination. However, Kirtner said, restaurant workers, who are at much higher risk for the disease, are disproportionately represented among intravenous drug users. Jones also criticized the health department for the outbreak, saying it "caught it a little late." But the real problem, he argued, was a "needle mill" that attracted undesirable people to Charleston. "Too many free meals drawing people in," he said.

Rhetoric like that -- the idea that services helping the homeless and drug-using people are destroying Charleston -- is becoming more mainstream.

That sort of dehumanization of the people most at risk for hepatitis A will make it difficult for public health providers to fight the disease. But there are a few bright spots, said Morris of the CDC. She is heartened by the sharing of information among afflicted states, the raised awareness about the issue among health departments nationwide, and the new recommendations from the CDC's vaccination advisory panel to make hepatitis A vaccination routine for the homeless -- a public health first. But Morris said she's not sure what next year's case count could look like. "I am hopeful we may not see the larger outbreaks that we're seeing currently, but it is very difficult to predict," she said.

Other public health experts are more pessimistic. "There is a good reason to suspect that this will further spread to other states," Gupta warned. "This is not yet over."

For Howard in Kentucky, just one question remains: "This is a disease of developing countries. One has to ask: Why are we seeing it in the USA?"

[As the numbers of cases continue to rise in a number of states and news of smaller (so far) outbreaks occur in others, the question asked at the end of the last post is more and more relevant. We are seeing these outbreaks because of the inability and, in part, lack of desire of local governments to deal with marginalized populations among their midst. The dramatic cutbacks in the public health infrastructure in some of these states clearly feeds the fire of these outbreaks. To blame the entire outbreak on restaurants (that reflect the overflow into food workers but has yet made much of an impact on the restaurants' patrons) is fool-hearty. It must be addressed by bolstering public health resources and education and directly addressing the needs of these marginalized populations. The restaurant risk is an easier fix, just require all food handlers to be immunized against hepatitis A virus.

No new numbers from the leading states, Kentucky and West Virginia, have been published in at least 2 weeks. - Mod.LL
