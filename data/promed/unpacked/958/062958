Farmers count losses after disease destroys rice
------------------------------------------------
Rice farmers in Mwea, Kirinyaga District [Central Province], are counting
their losses after their crop was attacked by the rice blast disease. The
farmers have been complaining about the disease, which has wiped out almost
half of their crop. "It started last year [2007] and since then it has been
spreading very fast," said Mr Francis Gichovi, a rice farmer in Mwea. The
disease is now threatening to drastically reduce harvests this season. An
acre of land under rice usually produces on average 25 bags of rice, but
this may reduce to 10 bags, Mr Gichovi said.

Many rice scientists consider it to be the most devastating rice disease
worldwide. It has been detected in 85 countries. Besides attacking the
leaves, the fungus may also attack the stem at the nodes, causing the neck
to rot, or at the panicle, causing panicle blast. When this occurs, yield
losses may be large because few seeds in the panicle develop. "The rice
plants have turned white and there is no seed in them," explains Gichovi.

According to the district agricultural office in Mwea, the disease has been
spurred by the rains, which have been unusually high this season. The
disease thrives in long periods of moisture, high humidity, little or no
night wind and night temperatures of around 20 degrees Celsius [68 degrees
Fahrenheit]. Poor crop rotation practices have also allowed the disease to
spread.

According to experts, successful control of the disease usually requires an
integrated management programme, including the use of resistant varieties,
cultural practices and chemical control. Farmers have been advised to burn
diseased rice straw and stubble. This is an important control measure that
reduces the disease prevalence, but will not provide complete control by
itself. Use of clean seeds whenever possible is also being encouraged to
help control the disease, seed treatment to eliminate blast is under study.
Continuous flooding is also recommended to limit its development.
Fungicides used in the past have not been effective in tackling the
disease, but there are some fungicides that can control neck rot or panicle
blast. Even though they are expensive, they may be economical to use at
this stage.

Plans to screen and breed resistant varieties are in progress. Varietal
resistance is the most economical way to control the disease. Resistance to
the disease in the plant is effective against attack at all stages of
growth. However, the fungus is highly variable -- new forms can appear
which attack resistant varieties.

[Rice blast is caused by the fungus _Magnaporthe grisea_ (synonyms
_Pyricularia oryzae_, _P. grisea_). It is one of the most destructive
diseases of rice worldwide with reported losses of more than 50 per cent in
infected fields. Symptoms include lesions on all parts of the shoot, stem
rot, and panicle blight. When nodes are infected, all plant parts above the
infection die and yield losses are severe. When infection occurs at the
seedling or tillering stages, plants are often completely killed. More than
50 species of grasses and sedges can be affected by different strains of
the fungus, but most strains isolated from rice can only infect a limited
number of cultivars.

Symptom severity and spread of the blast fungus are influenced by climatic
conditions. The disease is spread by infected plant debris, mechanical
means, water, and wind. Disease management may include fungicides and
cultural practices, but relies mainly on resistant varieties. The fungus is
highly variable, however, and new strains are emerging, breaking down host
resistance.
