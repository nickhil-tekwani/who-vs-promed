A middle-aged man died, and 28 others were hospitalized in Kericho after eating the carcass of a cow that died of anthrax. According to Kenegut Location Chief Sammy Koech, residents had been instructed to slaughter the animal and bury the remains but refused.

He told journalists that they divided the meat among themselves and took it home. "A team of health officials was dispatched to the area after residents started complaining of ill-health," he said. One of them was rushed to Kericho Sub-County Hospital but pronounced dead on arrival. The other residents were treated and discharged.

Samples of the carcass were later taken to the veterinary lab, and a test for anthrax turned out positive.

The chief has urged residents to refrain from consuming meat labelled as unfit for human consumption and report similar cases to relevant authorities.

[And so it goes on. When you have rural poverty, the desire for meat overrides common sense and experience.

Kericho county is located in the highlands west of the Kenyan Rift Valley. Standing on the edge of the Mau Forest, it has a warm and temperate climate, making it an ideal location for agriculture and, in particular, the large scale cultivation of tea.
