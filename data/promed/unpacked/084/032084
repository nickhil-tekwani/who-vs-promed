An outbreak of canine parvovirus is getting worse according to Los Angeles County officials.

According to the county Department of Animal Care and Control, 162 cases of parvovirus have been reported in Los Angeles County this year [2014], with 70 of them coming from Lancaster and Palmdale alone. Half of these cases were logged in the last month, meaning that there has been an unusual increase of the dangerous infection with puppies being the most common victims.

Although the disease is most commonly seen in young puppies, parvovirus can affect unvaccinated dogs of any age. All county residents are urged to keep puppies and dogs safe by not letting them outside of your fenced yard until they have received their vaccinations and are protected from the virus. "In springtime, you get a lot of newborns during that time and there's an increase in susceptible hosts," Maria Sabio-Solacito, the head veterinarian for animal care and control tells LA Times.

Parvo does not affect humans, but is highly contagious and deadly among dogs. The resilient virus is shed through bodily fluids and can survive for months or years on surfaces. It is easily spread by humans with their hands and feet.

Symptoms often begin with a high fever, lethargy, depression, and loss of appetite. If the disease is left untreated it can cause severe gastrointestinal distress, including vomiting and bloody diarrhea. In many cases, dehydration, shock, or death can follow. If your puppy or dog is exhibiting any of the symptoms of parvo, veterinary treatment is required immediately. Parvo vaccinations can be done by your vet and is also offered by many mobile vaccination programs.

For those living in Los Angeles, the county holds twice-monthly vaccination treatments for USD 14 Upcoming vaccination days are scheduled for 18 and 25 May 2014, 8 and 22 Jun 2014, and 6 and 20 Jul 2014. For more information visit http://www.animalcare.lacounty.gov

[This is a highly contagious disease and knowing the density of Los Angeles I strongly recommend any dog owner living there to get their dogs vaccinated ASAP, if they are not already covered. This also applies to anyone expecting canine guests from Lancaster or Palmdale.
