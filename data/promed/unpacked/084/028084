The spread of goat pox virus (GPV) on goat ranches in Taiwan has yet
to subside, with more than 5000 infected goats having been culled
since the 1st case this year [2010] was confirmed on 9 Apr 2010, the
Council of Agriculture (COA) said Sunday [16 May 2010].

A total of 5055 pox-infected goats from 32 goat farms in 6 counties
have been slaughtered as of 14 May 2010 to prevent the spread of the
virus, the COA said.

Affected goat farms in Yunlin, Changhua, Tainan, Taichung and Taoyuan
counties have also been disinfected, COA officials said.

GPV, a highly contagious disease of small ruminants that is
characterized by fever and ocular and nasal discharges, causes pox
lesions on the skin and on the mucous membranes of the nostrils,
mouth and vulva.

The mortality rate is high, with around 50 percent of infected adult
animals dying from the disease. GPV cannot infect humans and can be
destroyed at high temperatures, according to the council.

COA officials said no meat from any of the infected animals had found
its way to the retail meat market, but they said the virus can
survive in a normal environment for up to 6 months and is
transmittable via slaughterhouse facilities or vehicles.

Goat ranches have been told to start a self-monitoring system and
notify the COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and
Quarantine immediately when symptoms of the disease are observed, COA
officials said.

The council said it is still investigating the source of the infection.

This was the 2nd time that the disease has been reported in Taiwan.
The 1st outbreak was in July 2008 in northern Taoyuan County and was
believed to be started by an animal smuggled into Taiwan from
GPV-affected areas, including Viet Nam, China, Mongolia, Africa and
the Middle East, but the exact source remained unclear, the council said.

[A map showing the above outbreaks is appended to follow-up report
No. 4, submitted to the OIE on 13 May 2010. See at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=9141>.

The report included the following epidemiological comments:

"The causal agent of one farm depopulated by clinical inspection in
the previous follow-up report on 7 May 2010 was also identified as
Capripoxvirus by PCR and electron microscopy.

This report includes 11 outbreaks. Stamping out was carried out when
goats on index farms with typical signs of goat pox were observed by
clinical inspection and completed on 14 May 2010. Cleaning,
disinfection and movement restriction were implemented in all the
farms. Samples were collected during stamping out and sent to the
AHRI for confirmatory diagnosis. Capripoxvirus was identified as the
causal agent by PCR and electron microscopy in 5 of the 11 farms on
10, 11 and 12 May 2010. Confirmatory testing of the other 6 farms is ongoing."
