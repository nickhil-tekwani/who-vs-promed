Southeast Queensland could see more mosquitoes this summer as cases of Ross River fever rise across southeast Queensland. Weather forecasters claim a La Nina weather event is likely to cause more rain over the coming months, which will create perfect conditions for more mozzie hatchlings.

Brisbane City Council Opposition Leader Jared Cassidy said more needs to be done to stop the biting bugs. "What we're calling for are more resources, more bodies on the ground, and more equipment," he said.

But Councillor Kim Marx told 9News that Council will listen to the experts' advice. "The Lord Mayor has unlimited budget and unlimited resources," she said. "If the entomologists say there's more mozzies on the way and we need to spray more, that's absolutely what we will do."

Already this year [2020], 2128 cases of Ross River fever have been recorded, compared to 935 for the whole of 2019.

Deagon resident [JP] thinks she might've caught a mosquito-borne disease while tending her roses earlier this year [2020]. "My fingers and toes started hurting," she said. "It felt like they were swollen after I went for a walk, but it was just constant and achy."

Ross River fever is caused by a viral infection, transmitted through mosquito bites. People who are in contact with known mosquito habitats and who live in warm, humid climates near bodies of water will be most at risk of infection.

[Ross River virus [RRV] transmission has already been active in Australia this year (2020) with 2128 human cases. The threat of an oncoming wet season creating more extensive vector mosquito breeding sites is of legitimate concern. Infections occur sporadically across Australia when rains are heavy. RRV infection cases occur at times in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, and Western Australia. Making preparations to deal with an increase in vector mosquito populations is prudent as well as is informing the population of possible increased risk of infection with advice to avoid mosquito bites.

Common symptoms of Ross River virus infection include fever, joint pain, and feeling tired and generally unwell. There are no effective treatments available for RRV. While most people recover after 2-3 weeks, some cases are very serious and the infection can leave lingering problems such as arthritis in small joints, like those in the hands and feet, that can persist for weeks, making normal movement difficult.

Ross River virus is a zoonotic alphavirus transmitted by a wide range of mosquitoes, including _Aedes_ and _Culex_ species. - Mod.TY
