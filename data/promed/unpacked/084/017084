Wisconsin officials said Friday that they have identified at least four
people who took part in a Madison triathlon on July 5 and who later
developed symptoms of leptospirosis. [Note *symptoms* not serology or other
diagnostic evidence of infection. Laboratory tests have yet to be
completed. Wisconsin health officials say they now are more than halfway
through their effort to contact 279 Wisconsin residents who may have been
exposed to the disease [infection at two recent triathlons, one in Madison
on July 5 and another in Springfield, Ill., on June 21.
A total of 966 people took part in the Springfield race. About 850 people
competed in the Madison race, which held its swim portion in Lake Wingra.
It is likely that more people who took part in just the Madison event, and
who developed symptoms will be found, said Jeff Davis, chief medical
officer and state epidemiologist for communicable diseases with the state
Division of Health. [See below for comments by JD Diagnostic symptoms
include a fever AND two of the following -- chills, headache, muscle ache,
abdominal pain, red eyes and a rash; it is treated with common antibiotics.
"Even if one of those (four from the Madison triathlon) has leptospirosis,
that would be significant," Davis said.
So far, 74 people who may have contracted leptospirosis from participating
in either of the two triathlons have been identified by officials with the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Sixty-four of those
individuals were in only the Springfield event, four did just the Madison
event and six participated in both events. Of the 74 who are believed to
have had the disease, 54 sought medical attention and 21 of those were
hospitalized.

Thank you for the query. As of yet the serovar of leptospires in this
outbreak is not known. Results of culture of many specimens of blood and
urine are pending. The precise mechanisms of transmission of leptospires in
this outbreak have not yet been established; however, intensive
investigation is ongoing. The hypotheses offered by your readers [peeing
athletes had already been considered in the investigation, but the testing
of those hypotheses is also pending.
A nice summary of the outbreak and the progress of the investigation to
date is published in the July 24 MMWR and information is accessible through
the CDC website (http://www.cdc.gov) or by calling 1-888-OUTBREAK.

MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY WEEKLY REPORT,
CDC July 24, 1998 / Vol. 47 / No. 28

Outbreak of Acute Febrile Illness Among Athletes Participating in
Triathlons C Wisconsin and Illinois, 1998
On July 14, 1997, the Wisconsin Division of Health (WDOH) was notified by
the City of Madison Health Department that three athletes were hospitalized
with an acute febrile illness. The illness was characterized by fever,
myalgia, and headache with illness onset on July 6, 7, and 10,
respectively. One of these three athletes had acute renal failure. Two of
the athletes had participated in a triathlon held in Madison, Wisconsin, on
July 5 (692 registered participants) and all three had participated in a
June 21 triathlon in Springfield, Illinois (961 registered participants); a
triathlon is a race consisting of swimming, biking, and running
competitions. Eighty persons were registered for both events. Leptospirosis
was suspected by WDOH staff as a likely cause of the illness and CDC was
notified. Acute-phase serum specimens from two of the three hospitalized
athletes obtained 4 and 8 days following onset of fever have been tested at
CDC for leptospirosis using the PanBio enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) IgM screening test (PanBio, Brisbane, Australia); use of trade
names and commercial sources is for identification only and does not imply
endorsement by CDC or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. One
specimen tested positive. This report presents preliminary findings of an
ongoing investigation to identify additional cases of acute febrile illness
among athletes participating in these two triathlons and to determine the
cause of the illness.
To identify additional cases of febrile illness, triathlon participant
lists were obtained from the race organizers; athletes from 44 states
participated in at least one of the two events. A telephone survey of
participants identified additional athletes with unexplained febrile
illness. On July 17, CDC issued an advisory about the probable
leptospirosis outbreak to increase awareness among health-care providers,
athletes who participated in the Wisconsin and Illinois triathlons, and
residents of the communities in which these events were held, and to
request such illnesses be reported to CDC and state and local health
departments.
Through July 20, a total of 639 triathlon participants from 39 states had
been inter- viewed by telephone using a standardized questionnaire.
Interviews have been completed for 588 (61%) of the Illinois participants
and for 126 (18%) of the Wisconsin participants. A case was defined as
onset of fever during June 21-July 20 in a triathlon participant that was
associated with at least two of the following symptoms or signs:chills,
headache, myalgia, diarrhea, eye pain, or red eyes. Seventy-foul (12%)
participants interviewed had an illness that met the case definition. The
median age of these case-patients was 36 years (range: 15-80 years); 80%
were male. Case-patients were similar in age and sex to athletes who were
not ill. Among case-patients symptoms and signs of illness were chills
(89%), headache (77%), myalgia (73%), diarrhea (58%), eye pain (43%), and
red eyes (26%). Fifty-four (73%) sought medical care 21 (39%) of those were
hospitalized. Among hospitalized patients, two had acute renal failure, two
had abdominal surgery for suspected acute abdomen, and two had neurologic
illnesses; one had suspected leptospirosis diagnosed.
Among the 74 case-patients, 64 (86%), four (5%), and six (8%) participated
in the Illinois triathlon, the Wisconsin triathlon, or both, respectively.
Signs and symptoms of illness did not differ significantly between athletes
who participated exclusively in either the Illinois or Wisconsin triathlons
(two-tailed Fisher exact; all p>0.10). Acute phase serum samples obtained
from an additional 16 case-patients identified as a result of the
investigation have been tested at CDC for leptospirosis using Pan-Bio ELISA
IgM. Specimens from two case-patients, both of whom participated in only
the Illinois triathlon, tested positive. One of the 16 case-patients, who
also participated in only the Illinois triathlon and whose serum specimen
tested negative, had a cholecystectomy because of acute abdomen. No
histopathologic evidence of cholecystitis was seen Immunohistochemical
staining of the gall bladder at CDC using rabbit polyclonal reference
antiserum reactive with 16 different leptospiral strains was positive for
leptospirosis (I). Leptospiral antigens were seen as intact leptospira,
thread-like filaments, and granular forms (2). Paired, 2-week convalescent
serum specimens art being obtained for the 18 patients (these 16 patients
and the first two patients) whose acute-phase serum specimens (three
positive and 15 negative) have been tested.
CDC in collaboration with state and local health departments is continuing
to conduct epidemiologic, laboratory, and environmental investigations to
characterize further this outbreak. The objectives of these investigations
are to identify additional cases, to determine the etiology of illness
among athletes who participated in triathlons in both Illinois and
Wisconsin, to identify the source and mode of transmission and to develop
prevention and control measures.
Reported by: Wisconsin Outbreak investigation Team, Wisconsin Div of
Health; City of Madison Health Dept. B Davis, Springfield Dept of Public
Health, Springfield; Illinois Outbreak Investigation Team, Illinois Dept of
Public Health. Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, Atlanta,
Georgia. Infectious Disease Pathology Activity, Div of Viral and
Rickettsial Diseases, and Meningitis and Special Pathogens Br, Div of
Bacterial and Mycotic Diseases, National Center for Infectious Diseases;
and E/S officers, CDC.
Editorial Note: The clinical signs and symptoms of illness among athletes
meeting the case definition, the serologic and immunohistochemical testing,
and the epidemiologic association with prolonged water exposure (1.5-mile
lake swim) among these athletes suggest that leptospirosis, a water-borne
disease, most likely is the cause of this outbreak. Because the signs and
symptoms of leptospirosis are nonspecific, the case definition was
purposefully broad and, as a result, may be detecting illness attributable
to other causes. Although current epidemiologic data suggest that an
environmental exposure probably occurred in the Illinois triathlon,
additional laboratory and epidemiologic investigations are needed to
exclude illness attributable to more than one exposure. As a precautionary
measure, the city of Springfield and the Illinois Department of Public
Health have issued an advisory not to swim, water-ski, or use personal
watercraft at the site on the lake where the Illinois triathlon was held.
Because only 18% of the Wisconsin participants had been interviewed,
further interviews and laboratory evaluation of clinical specimens among
athletes who participated in the Wisconsin triathlon are needed to evaluate
the possibility of illness attributable to leptospirosis and to other
pathogens.
