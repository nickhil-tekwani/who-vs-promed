Southeast Asian countries launch veterinary network
----------------------------------------------------
A veterinary network for Southeast Asia has been launched to bolster
the campaign against avian influenza, the UN Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) announced on Friday at a 3-day regional meeting of
veterinary officers and laboratory experts in Bangkok.
2 similar networks for South and East Asia will follow soon, FAO
said, stressing that it will provide around 1.2 million USD for the
creation of these subregional platforms.
The networks will bring together affected and non-affected countries
to better coordinate the control and prevention of bird flu. "Our aim
is to improve the quality of diagnosis and epidemiological data. This
will help countries to judge the effectiveness of their control
systems, identify weaknesses or share successes. Therefore, the
region will be in a much better position to respond to the avian
influenza threat," said Joseph Domenech, Chief of the FAO Animal
Health Service.
"National borders cannot stop the spread of the disease. Avian
influenza, which continues to pose a serious threat to human and
animal health requires rapid and effective national and regional
responses. While individual countries have made some progress, only
regional cooperation is likely to achieve success," he said.
Consequently, national animal disease diagnostic laboratories and
field surveillance teams will have the capacity to diagnose and
detect avian influenza. Harmonized standards on disease detection and
reporting will be applied throughout the 3 subregions.
The networks will offer training and information exchange platforms
for national laboratories and surveillance teams from 23 Asian
countries.

The number of fowls being affected by bird flu in Vietnam rose to
some 63,000, according to local newspaper People's Army on Friday.
As of July 29, the disease hit 22 districts of 11 southern
localities, either killing or leading to the forced killing of nearly
38,000 chickens, 13,000 ducks and 12,000 quails in 30 small-scale
farms since late last month.
Bird flu may continue to spread, on a small scale, to other
localities across the country, especially provinces in the Mekong
Delta and the southeastern region in the coming time, the country's
Department of Animal Health
forecasted.
To deal with the situation, the department has asked localities to
intensify disease control, destroy suspected poultry flocks,
safeguard hygienic environment, and monitor fowl imports.
Bird flu killed 17 percent of the country's poultry population and
claimed 16 human lives during its outbreak in December 2003. A total
of 43.2 million fowls nationwide either died or were culled, causing
the local poultry industry to suffer direct losses of 1.3 trillion
Vietnamese dong (82.8 million US dollars).

Avian Influenza - Assessment of the current situation
--------------------------------
After a period of quiescence in Southeast Asia, outbreaks of highly
pathogenic avian influenza (A/H5N1)
(<http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/subjects/en/health/diseases-cards/special_avian.html>)
are again being reported in chickens and ducks in China, Indonesia,
Thailand and Viet Nam. In Thailand, outbreaks have been reported in
21 of 76 provinces; and in Viet Nam outbreaks were reported in the
northern, central and southern parts of the country. These outbreaks,
many without apparent epidemiological links to each other, suggest
A/H5N1 is now widely prevalent and is very likely to have become
endemic.
The outbreaks in birds pose a significant threat to human health.
As WHO has stated since the first A/H5N1 outbreaks were reported,
this virus has the potential to ignite a global influenza pandemic in
humans. In a number of
these outbreaks since the beginning of 2004, the virus has jumped
from infected chickens or ducks directly to humans. These direct
human infections have produced severe and sometimes fatal outcomes.
WHO's continuing concern is that this virus may reassort its genes
with those from a human influenza virus, thereby acquiring the
ability to move easily from human to human and thus triggering a
pandemic.
Recent media reports have occasionally suggested the presence of new
human cases of A/H5N1. WHO has received no information substantiating
these reports.
At a meeting in Bangkok which ended today, the Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO), in association with the World Organization for
Animal Health (OIE)
and WHO, announced plans to launch a new regional veterinary
influenza network. WHO welcomes this initiative as this network aims
to strengthen surveillance in animals and should provide more rapid
diagnosis of the disease.
The FAO/OIE regional animal laboratory network will closely link with
the WHO's global influenza programme to allow for more rapid sharing
of virus samples.
Faster and broader sharing of samples will enable WHO to monitor for
changes in the virus which could diminish the effectiveness of the
human vaccine currently under development. To date, such sample
exchanges have been retarded in some affected countries.
The risk of emergence of a new human pandemic virus will remain as
long as the avian influenza virus exists in the environment. Without
significant increase in control efforts at national and international
levels, it may be years before the virus is eradicated. While these
control efforts continue, WHO reemphasizes the need to monitor the
health of people on these front lines. Thus, WHO-coordinated
preparedness activities will continue and WHO encourages members
states to start or continue with their own influenza pandemic
preparedness plans.

One can not help but wonder whether H5N1 has become enzootic in China
and SE Asia in "backyard" unconfined chicken flocks in rural
villages. Are such flocks, often located in remote areas, subject to
the same level of systematic prospective surveillance as are the
large commercial flocks? If there are small "wandering foci" of H5N1
circulating in unconfined poultry, control by stamping out or even by
vaccination (unless free and coupled with extensive, village-level
education) may be extremely difficult. Comments from veterinary
services officials in these countries would be very interesting.

[Dr Yuill's valid comment deserves to be seriously addressed by the
relevant national and international authorities. The difficulty in
dealing with backyard and privately held avians, including
hobby-animals, has been clearly demonstrated on various occasions in
the past, recently (2003) during the HPAI outbreak in the Netherlands
and the Newcastle outbreak in California. - Mod.AS]
