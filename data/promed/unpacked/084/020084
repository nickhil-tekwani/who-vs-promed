Fisheries biologists have discovered cutthroat trout infected with whirling
disease in a second tributary of Yellowstone Lake. This means the disease
is spreading within the lake and Yellowstone National Park.
Dan Mahoney is a Yellowstone Park fisheries biologist. He says several
mature cutthroat trout taken from Bridge Creek earlier this year tested
positive for the parasite that causes whirling disease. Bridge Creek flows
into Yellowstone Lake at Bridge Bay.
Montana's first known outbreak of whirling disease struck the Madison River
to the west of Yellowstone in 1994 and quickly decimated young rainbow
trout. Eventually, rainbow numbers in the Madison declined by 90 percent or
more.
Meanwhile, park officials say only about half as many exotic lake trout
have been netted in Yellowstone Lake this year as last year.
Last year, crews caught about 7000 juvenile lake trout by setting gill nets
deep in Yellowstone Lake's West Thumb, home to the largest concentration of
lake trout.
So far this year, crews have hauled in about 4000 juvenile lake trout, and
they haven't caught any lake trout over 12 pounds, compared to dozens of
the larger, older fish in past years.
