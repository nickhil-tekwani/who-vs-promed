[According to the report above, a total of 82 960 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 4634 deaths, representing an increase of 6 cases in the 24 hours since yesterday's (17 May 2020) report. The newly reported cases include 6 new cases of confirmed infections -- 3 locally acquired cases (2 in Jilin province and 1 in Hubei province) and 3 imported cases, (all 3 from Inner Mongolia).

In Hong Kong, where numbers of newly confirmed cases had been reported daily, there were no newly confirmed cases reported in the past 24 hours. Macau has reported no newly confirmed cases. There have been a total of 1707 imported cases reported.

There were 17 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic people in the past 24 hours, all 17 cases were locally acquired. There was 1 case with conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The total number of asymptomatic individuals currently under observation (and isolation) is 389, and 29 of these are importations from abroad. I realize mentioning this on a daily basis is repetitious, but it would be helpful to know what proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals went on to be symptomatic in order to start developing projections of actual infection rates and adjust reported case fatality ratios accordingly. It is apparent that there is most likely thorough contact tracing and testing to explain the daily reports of asymptomatic infections in addition to the screening of individuals arriving from overseas.

As a reminder, it was reported on 24 Mar 2020 that China ended the lockdown in Hubei and elsewhere, and ended it in Wuhan on 7 Apr 2020. In the past few weeks, there have been locally transmitted clusters reported in Guangdong, Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Wuhan. The world is watching carefully to see whether this was safe timing to lift the lockdown. The worrisome observation vis a vis the cluster in Wuhan is that the virus had most likely been circulating there undetected until the cluster was identified. The positive case in Hubei may be linked to the case reported yesterday (17 May 2020) from Shanghai ex Hubei.

From the English Language page Notice: 320 of 18 May 2020 https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030
- Of the 15 new cases [in yesterday's (17 May 2020) update], 10 were imported cases and 5 were locally transmitted cases.
-- 2 of the locally transmitted cases are related to the nightclub cluster; 1 visitor to nightclubs/etc.; 1 contact.
-- 2 local cases are from Chungbuk Province; further investigation on the chain of transmission is underway.
-- 1 local case is a contact of previous confirmed case.

- 2 additional confirmed cases related to the clubs have been reported between 0:00 and 12:00 today, bringing the total related to the cluster to 170. Contact investigation and infection control measures are underway.
-- By region: Seoul City=93, Gyeonggi Province=33, Incheon City=25, Chungbuk Province=9, Busan City=4, Daejeon=1, Chungnam Province=1, Jeonbuk Province=1, Gyeongnam Province=1, Gangwon Province=1, Jeju Province=1
-- By chain of transmission: club visitors=89; contacts (family/acquaintance/coworkers/etc.)=81
-- By age group: [0-18]=17; [19-29]=102; [30-39]=27; [40-49]=11; [50-59]=6; [60+]=7
-- Male=137; female=33

- Recent investigations have found that a confirmed case related to the cluster (club visitor) also visited a nightlife entertainment venue in Bucheon City area (in Gyeonggi Province). All persons who visited "MeritNight" in Bucheon City between 23:48 [9 May 2020] to 0:34 [10 May 2020] are requested to contact a local public health center or dial 1339 and get tested for COVID-19.

- KCDC asked anyone who visited any of the nightlife entertainment venues in Itaewon area including any clubs or bars from 24 April to 6 May to:
-- stay home and refrain from going to other places;
-- contact a local public health center or dial 1339 (KCDC call center);
-- visit a screening clinic and get tested, regardless of symptoms.

- KCDC also emphasized that persons who work in education, places of worship, indoor sports/gym facilities, or other places that are used by many people should especially report to public health center if they have been exposed to above venues since their work environment creates a high risk of transmission.

- Even if test result is negative, it is still possible for the person to have been infected but in the 14-day incubation period before the virus activates. Therefore, those who have been instructed to self-quarantine should strictly follow the self-quarantine protocol. Persons who are not subject to self-quarantine should still minimize contact with other people. They should carefully practice personal hygiene measures including mask wearing and hand washing, and get retested immediately if symptoms appear later.

- Since [14 Apr 2020], re-positive cases* have been managed with measures similar to those for confirmed cases, while further investigation, research and analysis on the cases continued. As KCDC announced the findings from the investigation and analysis and the conclusions of the advisory committee today, the protocols for the management of such cases will be revised accordingly.
(*cases testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 again after being discharged from isolation)
-- Based on active monitoring, epidemiological investigation, and virological testing of re-positive cases and their contacts, no evidence was found that indicated infectivity of re-positive cases. Based on investigation of 790 contacts of the 285 re-positive cases, no case was found that was infected solely from contact with re-positive cases during re-positive period. Viral culture test results of 108 re-positive cases were all negative.
-- 3 contacts of re-positive cases were newly confirmed. However, epidemiological studies cannot exclude the possibility of exposure to other infection sources, and viral culture result was negative from re-positive cases and their contacts. Therefore, it cannot be conclusively determined that the 3 cases were infected by re-positive cases.
-- Based on the findings, KCDC has decided to stop using the current protocols for the management of confirmed cases after discharge from isolation and for the management of re-positive cases. Once the new revised protocols go into effect, the new protocols will also be applied to existing discharged/re-positive cases. Under the new protocols, no additional tests are required for cases that have been discharged from isolation. Therefore, employers or schools should not require discharged cases to provide a negative PCR test result in order to return to work or school after discharge from isolation.
-- Reporting and investigation of re-positive cases and investigation of contacts of re-positive cases will be continued as before. However, based on experts' recommendations, the terminology referring to such cases will be changed from "re-positive" to "PCR re-detected after discharge from isolation."

- In light of the recent rise in local transmissions related to clubs, bars, karaoke rooms, and after-school private academies, KCDC urged people to refrain from social gathering or visiting any enclosed/confined/crowded spaces that are frequented by many people.
-- People who cannot avoid visiting an enclosed/crowded space for an essential reason should carefully follow personal hygiene measures including keeping 2 meters of distance from other people, wearing a facemask, avoiding handshakes, washing hands, and not touching eyes, nose, or mouth with their hands.
-- Persons belonging to high-risk groups (including elderly, pregnant women, persons with chronic illness) should especially avoid any poorly ventilated enclosed space frequented by many people. If such a situation cannot be avoided for an essential reason, it is highly important to wear a facemask.

- Anyone who has come in close contact with a large number of unspecified persons in an enclosed/confined space such as clubs or bars need to be tested at a screening clinic through public health center or 1339 call center.

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 13 cases with 0 deaths compared with yesterday's 24-hour period (17 to 18 May 2020) when there were 15 newly confirmed cases and 1 death. A total of 11 078 confirmed cases and 263 deaths were reported today (18 May 2020), up from 11 065 cases and 263 deaths yesterday (17 May 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 46 consecutive days and below 50 for 39 consecutive days. For several days, the count was below 10 but started climbing over the last 11 days. In today's (18 May 2020) breakdown of cases, 9 of the cases were locally transmitted, and 4 were locally transmitted. Locally acquired cases were in Seoul (6), Incheon (2) and Gyeonggi (1). Imported cases were in Ulsan (4).

According to the English language update, the Itaewon nightclub cluster is now up to 170 cases, 89 club attendees and 81 contacts (family, friends) involving 11 provinces in the country. The detailed contact tracing is impressive. It's also interesting to see the conclusions on management of those cases with recurrent positive PCRs following a negative PCR after quarantine/illness has resolved - release from quarantine and no need to re-test. As a reminder, the Koreans investigated with virus isolation and documented there was no live virus in these individuals.

As they move to the next phase -- "distancing in daily life" -- all eyes will be on the country to see whether they can maintain the level of control they have had. Importations continue to be a main problem, but the Itaewon nightclub cluster and now possibly a 2nd club district are major concerns at this time. With these outbreaks associated with club districts in Seoul, there may be a rethinking of next steps. All individuals with history of club attendance or other crowded locations are now being encouraged to get tested, even if asymptomatic, recognizing the potential role of asymptomatically infected individuals in transmission of the virus.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 225 886 cases, including 32 007 deaths, up from 225 435 cases and 31 908 deaths reported on 17 May 2020. The 24-hour change between 16 and 17 May 2020 was 451 newly confirmed cases, compared with 675 newly confirmed cases between 16 and 17 May 2020, a decrease of 224 from yesterday's (17 May 2020) change. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are also experiencing a decline.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in the northern part of the country, in Lombardy, the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Piedmont. These 4 provinces combined account for 64.5% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Lombardy is the main contributor, representing 38.8% of all newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Today (18 May 2020) is the 2nd day Lombardy is the only province reporting more than 100 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. 11 provinces reported less than 10 newly confirmed cases (4 provinces, Umbria, Sardinia, Basilicata, and Calabria, reported no new cases), and another 8 provinces reported fewer than 50 newly confirmed cases, all signs of decreasing local transmission. Piedmont is the only province reporting 50 or more cases (but less than 100).

There is an excellent interactive map at http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1 to visualize the caseloads per region in near real time.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces, where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was expanded to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of non-essential businesses. It is now 65 days since the start of the lockdown in the north and 64 days since the countrywide lockdown. The lockdown was extended through 3 May 2020 (see ProMED-mail post 20200411.7211958 for details). All eyes are now on Italy as lockdown restrictions are phased out.

[4] Iran: 122 492 total cases, 7057 deaths

Source: New Straits Times, Agence France-Presse (AFP) report [edited]
https://www.nst.com.my/world/world/2020/05/593622/iran-covid-19-death-toll-tops-7000


Iran's Health Ministry recorded 2294 new COVID-19 coronavirus infections in the past 24 hours, raising the country's total to 122 492. Meanwhile, ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said the virus death toll had risen to 7057, with 69 fatalities in the past day. Experts both at home and abroad have voiced scepticism about Iran's official figures, saying the real toll could be much higher.

Jahanpour said the situation is becoming critical in the provinces of Lorestan, North Khorasan, Kerman, Sistan and Baluchistan, and Kermanshah. Khuzestan, which is still in the high-risk category, accounted for about a quarter of the new cases detected in the past 24 hours, he added. The southwestern province has become Iran's new coronavirus hotspot and is the only region so far where authorities have reimposed business lockdowns after a country-wide relaxation in April [2020].

[In the 24 hours from 17 to 18 May 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran grew from 120 198 to 122 492 total cases, an increase of 2294 compared with 1806 newly confirmed cases reported yesterday (17 May 2020). The number of deaths has increased from 6988 to 7057, an increase of 69 deaths in the 24-hour period. In terms of total numbers of confirmed cases, Iran ranks 10th globally, behind the USA, Russia, Spain, the UK, Brazil, Italy, France, Germany, and Turkey (Worldometer data as of 18 May 2020; 20:13 EDT (GMT-4).

As with other countries that are lifting business closures, all eyes are on Iran now that "low risk" businesses are opening, and, unfortunately, it appears as though the opening may have been premature as daily newly confirmed case counts are increasing. The caution is that there is usually a 2-3 week lag between increasing cases and increases in reported deaths, so it may be too early to conclude there aren't increases in deaths. Other countries that are rushing to reopen their economies might look at Iran to learn from its experience.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA, as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 1 550 294, including 91 981 deaths, an increase from 1 527 664 cases and 90 978 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York state, with 361 266 (23.3%) cumulative case reports and 1419 (6.3%) newly confirmed cases over the past 24 hours, is still clearly the epicenter of the outbreak in the USA, although case reporting elsewhere is increasing. New York City had a cumulative total of 191 073 as of 3:00 PM EDT on 18 May 2020, including 15 983 confirmed deaths and an additional 4823 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

Daily reported case counts are high in Illinois (2294 -- 10.1%), New Jersey (1890 -- 8.4%), California (1446 -- 6.4%), New York (1419 -- 6.3%), Massachusetts (1042 -- 4.6%), Texas (1007 -- 4.5%), and Maryland (958 -- 4.2%). In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by New Jersey, Illinois, Massachusetts, California, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Texas, Florida, and Maryland.

As per the WHO Situation Report 98 from 27 Apr 2020 (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200427-sitrep-98-covid-19.pdf and in COVID-19 update (136): UK NHS increased testing, Brazil, WHO 20200428.7274496), Spain has been reporting only PCR positive confirmations, and not antibody-based tests, to WHO, since 25 Apr 2020. The antibody-confirmed cases are no longer available in Table 4, so I am using the Worldometer data as done previously. There were 285 newly confirmed cases by PCR in the past 24 hours compared with 421 in the preceding 24-hour period [from 15 to 16 May 2020], bringing the PCR- [plus number confirmed including all tests] confirmed cumulative total to 231 606 [278 188] cases as compared with 231 350 [277 719] confirmed cases on 17 May 2020. Daily death reports are decreasing as well, with 27 709 deaths reported today (18 May 2020) and 27 650 deaths reported on 17 May 2020, an increase of 59 deaths in 24 hours.

The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population continues to decrease and is now 20.02, a continual slow decrease over the past 26 days from a high of 214.4 on 7 Apr 2020 to 20.02 today (18 May 2020). Spain has the highest case count in Europe and is 2nd globally behind the USA in terms of absolute numbers of cases. Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease, and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times. There is also a clear growth curve showing the trajectory of the epidemic at https://covid19.isciii.es/; it is updated daily.

According to Table 2, of the 231 606 [278 188] cases, an additional 172 cases have been hospitalized (PCR positive), and an additional 15 cases were admitted to ICU (PCR positive). Overall, 9.1% of hospitalized patients have been admitted to ICU.

[7] Italy: continued openings, phase 2
Date: 18 May 2020
Source: Italian MOH [edited:
http://www.salute.gov.it/portale/news/p3_2_1_1_1.jsp?lingua=italiano&menu=notizie&p=dalministero&id=4775


Shops, bars, and restaurants are reopening on [18 May 2020], as Italy steps up phase 2 by further easing the lockdown measures imposed due to the coronavirus emergency.

Hairdressers, barbers, beauty salons, and beaches are reopening too after Premier Giuseppe Conte signed off a new timetable for phase 2 following talks with regional governments, which have the power to vary the measures on the basis of local conditions.

People must wear facemasks in closed public places and on public transport and social-distancing rules must be respected. But they no longer need to carry around a self-certification statement declaring their reason for being outside as long as they are moving around in their home region.

An initial easing of the lockdown measures that saw around 4 million people return to work took place 2 weeks ago.

Swimming pools, gyms, and other sports facilities are set to reopen on [25 May 2020].

Then movements between regions will be possible from [3 Jun 2020], when European borders are also set to reopen.

Theatres and cinemas are set to return to work on [15 Jun 2020].

[This is now a continuation of the phase 2 opening that began on 3 May 2020. All eyes will be on Italy to see if they are able to keep the case counts at a low level or if there will be an increase. - Mod.MPP]
