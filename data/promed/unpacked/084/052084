A Reuters newswire story published in The Washington Post today said that
the outbreak of lassa fever in Sierra Leone is in danger of spreading to
Freetown, the capital city. Quoting a spokesman for a British medical
volunteer organization, Reuters said there have been 239 reported cases
with 35 deaths in the first four months of this year compared to 367 cases
and 93 deaths in the previous 12 months -- almost a 50% increase in cases
and a slight increase in fatalites so far this year.
One factor contributing to the situation is the 6-year old civil war that
is forcing refugees into the northern coast town of Kenema, approximately
60 miles from the capital, Kenema is described as "packed" with refugees,
making conditions "ripe" for rapid spread.
The British spokesman said "You can get it just by shaking hands, if
someone infected is sweaty and you have a cut on your hand." He also said
that his group is buying as much ribaviran as it can.
