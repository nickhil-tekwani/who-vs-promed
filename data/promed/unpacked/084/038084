BTV-8 in Europe
---------------
[In the absence of uniform, comprehensive, updated official data on the
BTV-8 situation in the 8 European countries thus far affected, we welcome
the initiative of Susan Baekeland (France) and Sabine Zentis (Germany) to
collect the data from various available official and unofficial sources and
provide the following report to try summarise the accummulated number of
outbreaks (meaning affected holdings, unless indicated otherwise) during
2007. These statistics are not accurate and should be seen just as a tool
to evaluate the dimensions of the epizootic. Comments, additions, and
updates from knowledgeable sources would be welcomed. - Mod.AS]

France had a total of 12 675 laboratory confirmed cases*, most of them
BTV-8 but including BTV-2,4 and 16 on the Island of Corsica and BTV-1 in
the department Pyrenees-Atlantique.
*In contrast with other EU countries, France reports individual, laboratory
confirmed cases and not "holdings". However, if only one sample is tested
from a holding, for this particular outbreak "case" will not differ from
"holding".

[2] Vector-free season

Bluetongue update: vector-free period confirmed and movement restrictions
relaxed
-----------------------------------------------------
A vector-free period for Bluetongue disease has been declared from Thu 20
Dec 2007, allowing relaxation of certain movement restrictions in relation
to the control of bluetongue.
Falling temperatures and declining midge counts have allowed DEFRA to
determine a period where risk of disease spread is lower. Based on
historical data, such a period of low vector activity may continue into
March 2008, but this will be kept under review with consideration of midge
activity and weather conditions.
Declaration of a vector-free period gives the industry an opportunity to
move livestock, subject to pre-movement testing, out of the bluetongue
restriction zones and into the free area.
Acting chief veterinary officer, Fred Landeg, said, "I am sure that this
will come as welcome news for the farming industry and livestock keepers,
and will free up movements from our current restriction zones to the rest
of Great Britain. It is still important however for livestock keepers to
remain vigilant and report any suspicions of disease."
Arrangements have also now been agreed to allow farmers who occupy land
within 8km [5 mile] of the current Surveillance Zone boundary to have that
land designated as part of the Surveillance Zone. Farmers must apply to
their local Animal Health Divisional Office, and detailed rules, including
record keeping of animal movements, will need to be met.

[It will be interesting to note the scientific background for the decision;
it is to be hoped that the advice of Pirbright's IAH (Institute of Animal
Health) experts was sought. Pirbright and Onderstepoort laboratories have
been world leaders in BTV research and diagnosis for decades. In
particular, the study of the transmitting midges, culicoides, has been
thoroughly addressed. For IAH's Guide to the British Culicoides, go to

[3] UK: vaccine ordered

Order placed for bluetongue vaccine
-----------------------------------
The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) has today
[19 Dec 2007] announced that it is placing a firm order with pharmaceutical
company Intervet to supply 22.5 million doses of bluetongue vaccine. This
follows a full assessment of the 3 bids submitted during the tender process
announced by DEFRA on 1 Nov 2007.
Although no suitable vaccine is currently available for the strain of
bluetongue circulating in England (serotype 8), this order will ensure that
vaccine will be available as early as possible next summer to control the
impact of Bluetongue and ease movement restrictions on vaccinated animals.
In keeping with the principles set out in the Bluetongue Control Strategy,
which was developed in partnership with the farming industry, livestock
keepers will be offered the opportunity to purchase vaccine from the
vaccine bank.
Animal health and welfare minister Jeff Rooker said, "I am pleased to
announce that, following careful assessment of tenders for bluetongue
vaccine, DEFRA has chosen Intervet to supply 22.5 million doses. This
decision is based on consideration of technical specification and price,
and I am confident that the Intervet vaccine will offer the best value and
most effective option to farmers."
DEFRA is urgently continuing work on developing a detailed plan with
bluetongue scientific experts, representatives of the farming industry and
others as to how a vaccination programme would work. We will discuss this
plan further with external scientific experts and stakeholders.

[The ordered vaccine is inactivated; OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests and
Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals, chapter (Bluetongue), includes as
paragraph C "requirements for vaccines and diagnostic biologicals". But
only live-attenuated BTV vaccines are currently covered.
It is to be hoped that the vaccine will be ready for field application
before May 2007, enabling mass vaccination of susceptible animals
(primarily sheep) before the beginning of the summer. - Mod.AS]
