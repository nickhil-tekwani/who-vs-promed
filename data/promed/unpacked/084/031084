Recent crow die-offs suggest the West Nile virus which emerged in New York
in late August could be more deadly to North American bird species than to
species in Africa, the Middle East and Europe, where the virus is normally
found, a USGS scientist reported today at a congressional field hearing
held in Connecticut by the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works.
Dr. Robert G. McLean, director of the USGS National Wildlife Health Center
in Madison, Wis., briefed the committee on the role of native bird
populations and other wildlife in the emergence of West Nile virus in the
United States. Detection of the virus in birds and other animal species
provides critical information to public health agencies tracking the
infection in people.
"The high mortality in crows and other bird species is unusual," McLean
said. "This suggests that this virus is more virulent to our native birds or
it may represent a new, more virulent strain of the virus."
Resident and migratory birds may play an important role in natural
transmission of the virus and in maintaining the virus in the United
States, McLean testified. "Migratory birds could also spread the virus to
other states outside of the New York City area," he said. "Enhanced
monitoring through surveillance for early, rapid detection of West Nile
virus in states outside the affected area will be important to guide
prevention measures."
The emergence of West Nile virus in the United States, which led to the
deaths of 7 people from West Nile encephalitis, has brought together
the combined expertise and resources of many federal and state agencies
along the eastern seaboard. Several federal and state agencies and private
groups are searching for stored human and animal specimens that were
collected prior to 1999 in order to test them for the presence of West Nile
virus. These specimens are also being tested for antibodies to determine if
the virus was present in the United States before the 1999 outbreak.
Results from these investigations should provide more insight into how,
where and when the virus was introduced, McLean noted.
McLean also discussed the activities and efforts of the USGS in
investigating the wildlife aspects of this virus. "As of early November, 392
birds have been tested by USGS and Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), and 192 were positive for West Nile virus," McLean said.
"The virus has infected at least 20 species of birds, including exotic and
native birds at zoos, and about 4 species of mosquitoes. But, it is
difficult to assess how many birds have died from this disease."
USGS, CDC, U.S. Department of Agriculture and other agencies have
heightened wildlife surveillance for detection of West Nile virus, and they
have expanded monitoring to other Atlantic and Gulf Coast states. McLean
assured the committee, "We are continuing to collaborate on enhanced
surveillance and to determine what specific surveillance methods will work
best for each region."
McLean believes that native bird populations will play a key role in the
elucidation of the long-term impacts of the West Nile virus in the United
States. He added, "Additional research is needed in order to determine if
wildlife, mosquito or both populations in the affected areas can maintain
the virus in New York and other states and serve as an over wintering
source for resurgence next summer."

[The headline on this article was "West Nile virus may be new deadly
strain".
Writers for newspapers and other media like to make things more
dramatic than they are; it improves circulation. This sort of hype improves
my circulation also. I do not know what proportion of any given poulation
of humans is paranoid but it seems to me that these people come out of the
woodwork every time a new virus is discovered. You would think they would
be accustomed to these discoveries by now. The problem is that
non-paranoids get caught up in the hysteria of the moment and fantastic
claims begin to circulate: that the U.S. Government is behind all this,
that the virus was accidentally released, that this was biowarfare research
gone wrong, that USDA's Plum Island Animal Research Center is an
undercover operation for something, etc.
We have seen all these claims since this outbreak began. Crap! USDA, CDC,
NIH, USGS and other US Government agencies do a remarkable job of
maintaining the health of US citizens, livestock, and crops. It may be that
various agencies have not done all they could to inform the public of their
activities and should make greater
efforts to do so, but that is not equivalent to carrying out "secret
trials".
What Bob was saying was that the birds of the Western Hemisphere may be
exquisitely sensitive to West Nile virus and that we simply do not know what
to expect next spring in the northeastern US or throughout the hemisphere.
This strain of West Nile virus is very close genetically to a recent isolate
of West Nile virus from Israel. It is not a new strain. The question is
whether it will spread further in the ecosystems of the Western Hemisphere.
There is no doubt this is a troubling possibility. Underfunded research
will continue. - Mod.CHC]
