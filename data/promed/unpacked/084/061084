The head of the Local Association of State Workers [ATE], Claudio Arevalo, said the study at Malbran Hospital showed that the deceased worker belonging to the Delegation of Solano had a hantavirus [infection]. The deceased man was an employee of the Solano Delegation and worked for more than 35 years for the Quilmes municipality.

Many of his fellow ATE workers mentioned that his was a presumed case of leptospirosis, which was discarded by the community and by the head of the Special Laboratory of the Malbran Hospital, Dr Alicia Hoffer.

The head of ATE, Claudio Arevalo, stated that the study done by the hospital had come up with the diagnosis of a hantavirus infection, which caused the death of the worker who belonged to the Solano delegation.

[This is the 3rd fatal case of a hantavirus infection in Buenos Aires province this year (2015). There were several cases of hantavirus infection in Buenos Aires province during 2014, 3 of which have been fatal cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). There were also 2 previous cases there this year (2015) as well [see ProMED-mail archive listed below].

Public education is essential to prevent rodent populations, the reservoir hosts of the virus, from becoming established in houses and other buildings. The hantaviruses involved in the above report and in the previous cases are not identified, and ProMED-mail would be interested in knowing whether a specific virus has been laboratory identified.

Cases of hantavirus infection have been reported from various parts of Argentina over the past 3 years (2012, 2013, and 2014). As noted in ProMED-mail archive no. 20110430.1348, several endemic hantaviruses have been associated with human infection in Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Lechiguana (in central Argentina in the yellow pygmy rice rat _O. flavescens_); Oran (in north western Argentina in _O. longicaudatus_); and Bermejo (western Argentina in _O. flavescens_). Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved in these 2014 Buenos Aires province cases. Andes virus seems unlikely in this case, but these cases in Buenos Aires province may have been caused by Lechiguana virus infection.

An image of the yellow pygmy rice rat, _O. flavescens_, the Lechiguana virus rodent reservoir, is available at http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_WrdzfKHDxmQ/SJ-E642S6MI/AAAAAAAABz4/DaDCHaFSDDE/s400/rato+dagua.jpg.
