Subject: Avian Influenza - Italy

There is a serious avian influenza epidemic taking place in northern Italy
at this moment, and yet it seems almost impossible to get any good
information on it. Nobody seems willing to talk about it.
As a magazine editor for poultry industry I am interested in finding out as
much as possible: so that the industry is kept updated, and so we can take
the "lessons learned" aspect for prevention purposes.
Here is a summary of what I know: The region affected is northern Italy and
the situation started over a year ago with a low pathogenic strain (I
presume). The strain mutated into the highly pathogenic H7N1 strain late
last year or early this year. The first reports were of turkey mortalities:
first 2 million, then 7 million. Then it went to layers, with another 7 to
9 million mortalities reported. The last word I heard (this week) from
reputable scientists in the US and Europe was there are 22 million dead
birds and that it has spread beyond the borders of Italy. (Exactly where
was not divulged).
The regions of Lombardia and veneto seem to the most affected and there
have been 170 outbreaks reported.
In using the term "mortality" I include birds killed by the influenza as
well as destroyed birds. The destruction of infected flocks was, in fact,
the way the Italians chose to control the outbreak. At first they were
criticized for this, but now it is seen as a wise decision. Apparently they
are now starting to vaccinate poultry flocks in the area against AI.
I am looking for someone who has the "big picture" of this situation, to
give an overview of what is happening, how many turkeys, layers and
broilers have been affected, what has been the response of industry and
government, and what the future of this situation is. I appreciate your help.
