Beijing bird flu patient dies
-----------------------------
A 19-year-old woman has died of bird flu in the Chinese capital
Beijing. It is the 1st time in almost a year that someone in China
has died after being infected with the H5N1 strain of avian influenza
[virus], which is dangerous to humans.

The woman was admitted to hospital on 24 Dec 2008, and Chinese media
report she had bought a duck at a market outside Beijing. She is
thought to have become unwell after slaughtering the bird.

The bird flu virus is passed on via direct contact with infected
birds or their droppings. Experts fear the virus could mutate into a
strain transmitted from human to human. Since the H5N1 strain
surfaced in Asia in 2003, about 250 people have died as a result of bird flu.

No Avian Influenza Appears Near Residence of Deceased
-----------------------------------------------------
Health agencies report a human case of avian influenza in Beijing's
Chaoyang district. On 5 Jan 2009 after receiving a report from the
Municipal Health Bureau, Beijing veterinary agencies carried out
strict inspection in the area surrounding the patient's residence.
The inspection found that there is no poultry raised at the patient's
residence or within a 10-km [6.2-mile] area.

An epidemiological investigation of Chaoyang, Tongzhou, Miyun and
other districts found no abnormal circumstances among poultry. A
national immunization investigation in December 2008 showed that
Beijing's avian influenza immunization density was 100 percent. The
qualified [confirmed] antibody rate was 100 percent. In 2008, Beijing
took a total of 41 641 surveillance samples for avian influenza and
all were negative.

[As of 16 Dec 2008, according to the World Health Organisation
(<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2008_12_16/en/index.html>)
391 people have contracted H5N1 avian influenza and there have been
247 fatalities. The death of this young woman in Beijing is the 392nd
case and the 248th death worldwide. The 19-year-old woman is the 31st
case of H5N1 avian influenza to be confirmed in China, and the 21st
death. The most recent previous case of H5N1 avian influenza in China
occurred in February 2008.

Although resident in Beijing, the victim appears to have contracted
infection from a fowl purchased in a market distant from her district
of residence in Beijing. Further information is awaited.
