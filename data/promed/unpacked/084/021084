Measles in the Philippines
--------------------------
The recent outbreak in Western Visayas province of the Philippines [see:
Measles - Philippines: (WV) 20090115.0171] belies the fact that measles
rates in the Philippines have declined dramatically since the 1990-92s, in
parallel with increased vaccination usage. See graph at
<http://exhibit.gideononline.com/measles-phil.jpg>.

From 1983 to 1997, the Philippines had reported one of the highest measles
rates in this region. See graph at
