In Berezov district (Khanti-Mansiysky autonomous region), the number
of patients with tularemia has increased to 23 persons. It is
reported that, all infected persons, among them 3 children, have been
hospitalized. It is thought that rodents are the source of infection.
Rodents' burrows were flooded because of high level of water,
therefore the animals had to search for new habitation close to
[human] settlements. Insects may have played a significant role in
transmission of infection.

[In Russia, tularemia cases are reported, with 100-400 cases
annually; 70 percent of cases are in the Northern, Central, and
Western-Siberian areas of Russia. The nature zones have time
variations when their epizootic and epidemiological activity can be
replaced by interepidemic 3.5-9 years periods.
Seasonal variations of tularemia morbidity are varied in different
zones and depend on a number of reasons (including the activity of
infected rodents, activity of carriers (insects), and activity of
people). Most likely, in this region a set of various factors has
played a role in the acute increase of tularemia cases. - Corr.BA]
[In addition to transmission of _F. tularensis_ related to contact
with infected animals and via arthropod bites, the infection can be
spread through water. The symptom complex in the patients has not
been stated in the reports, which can assist in delineating a mode of
transmission.
The Khanti-Mansiysky Autonomous Okrug (also called Yugra) is located
on the West Siberian Plain. It is a part of the Tyumen Region. - Mod.LL]
