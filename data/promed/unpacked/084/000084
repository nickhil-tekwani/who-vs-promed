Independent journalists reported on the deaths of 2 people and the hospitalization of about 50 as a result of an outbreak of cholera in the Cuban municipality of Manzanillo. The health emergency started in midweek. Cuban government officials have made no mention of the crisis but it has been learned that the municipality of Manzanillo, in the eastern province of Granma, has been declared in "quarantine".

The Provincial Clinical and Surgical Hospital "Celia Sanchez Manduley", where the patients with reported cholera were admitted, is guarded by state security agents and police officers, according to a report by journalist Calixto R Martinez. The report was published on the website of the "Hablemos Press" [Let's Talk Press] news agency, based in Havana.

According to the daily El Nuevo Herald [Miami], local residents interviewed by Martinez agreed that the situation has exceeded the capacity of the hospital, and commented that health authorities are seeking help from other municipalities.

At least 2 people died and more than 50 remain hospitalized in the town of Manzanillo, in eastern Cuba, where authorities decreed a quarantine at the Provincial Clinical and Surgical Hospital "Celia Sanchez Manduley". Police and state security agents guard the medical center, according to testimony given by residents in the cities of Manzanillo and Bayamo.

Although the government has maintained total silence and the news has not spread in official media, the medical situation seems rather complicated.

"At least 2 deaths have been reported and the hospital cannot cope, the aisles are full of stretchers with patients... ...already more than 50 people, including children and adults hospitalized with the disease," [says MCF, a resident] of Manzanillo. The identity of the deceased was not reported, although both were adults.

MCF said the outbreak is stronger in the communities of La Pesquera, Las Novilla, and La Vuelta el Cano, who have been quarantined by the authorities. All medical personnel have been mobilized to Manzanillo.

YGJ, who lives in the nearby city of Bayamo, claims she learned of the outbreak of the disease while visiting Manzanillo on 26 Jun 2012. "In the hospital Celia Sanchez hospital security staff were replaced by police officers and state security agents, to prevent information from leaving the hospital," she said.

A source connected to a government agency confirmed the reports of cholera in the area. On the afternoon of 28 Jun 2012, the popular program "Frecuencia 12" of the Granma local television abruptly reported an outbreak of diarrheal disease in the province, but gave no details of the affected areas.

At least 2 dead and more than 100 people have been hospitalized as a result of a cholera outbreak in the Cuban city of Manzanillo, Granma province. The medical emergency began in the middle of this week [week of 25 Jun 2012] in the localities of La Pesquera and La Vuelta el Cano. Cuban government officials have not spoken officially about the situation.

"We have suspended the street sales of drinks and have been told that police have closed several restaurants as a precautionary measure," said Roberto de Jesus Guerra, director of Hablemos Press news agency, based in Havana.

Sources consulted by El Nuevo Herald confirmed that authorities ordered a state of "quarantine" to prevent the spread of the disease.

The Provincial Clinical and Surgical Hospital "Celia Sanchez Manduley" where most of those affected are hospitalized, is guarded by state security agents and police officers, said De Jesus.

The cholera outbreak in the eastern part of the island surprised locals and raised questions in Miami about how an outbreak of a disease, believed to have been controlled in Cuba, began. A hypothesis on the health emergency did not rule out the possibility that this was caused by contagion from the group of volunteers, doctors, and aide workers who served in Haiti. Recently a group of 119 health professionals -- the Cuban Medical Brigade (BMC) -- returned to the island after having completed an assistance mission in Port-au-Prince.

The exiled Cuban doctor Julio Cesar Alfonso, chief executive of Solidarity Without Borders, said the possibility that the source of infection was generated among the group of Cuban volunteers in Haiti "can not be ruled out".

"In any case it very strange because a case of cholera has not been reported in Cuba for a long time," said Alfonso.

[ProMED-mail awaits additional information regarding this outbreak thought to be cholera.

Cases of cholera have been imported into the USA from Haiti without spread as developed countries with adequate clean water do not easily promote an outbreak.

The sanitary conditions in the southern area of Cuba where the outbreak is occurring are not clear. - Mod.LL
