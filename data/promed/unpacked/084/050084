Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Detected in La Crosse County
--------------------------------------------------------
The Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection (DATCP) announces that the state's 1st case of Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus Serotype 2 (RHDV2) has been found in 3 domestic rabbits in La Crosse County.

RHDV2 is a highly contagious viral disease that affects wild and domestic rabbits. Although fatal to rabbits, the disease does not affect humans. In most cases, the only signs of RHDV2 are sudden death and blood-stained noses caused by internal bleeding. Infected rabbits experience fever, loss of appetite, difficulty breathing or seizures.

In October 2021, DATCP authorized a RHDV2 vaccine for use in Wisconsin, and the department continues to encourage rabbit owners to work with their veterinarians to have their animals immunized.

Rabbit owners can reduce the risk of disease introduction by taking precautions when moving rabbits to fairs/shows, buying equipment, handling rabbits which aren't their own, introducing new rabbits to their household, and when keeping their animals outdoors. Even with vaccine use, DATCP recommends anyone working with or caring for rabbits follow biosecurity guidelines to prevent spread of the disease.

Rabbit owners are asked to contact their veterinarians if their animals appear sick. To report multiple dead wild rabbits, contact the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR).

[Rabbit owners are encouraged to take advantage of vaccines and reach out to your veterinarian and to the public information officer for additional assistance.

"Rabbit hemorrhagic disease is a fatal disease in rabbits and is considered a foreign animal disease in the United States. This disease is caused by several virus strains. Animal health officials detected one of these strains, Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus Serotype 2 (RHDV2), in North America in the past few years. RHDV2 does not impact human health.

"RHDV2 can be spread through direct contact or exposure to an infected rabbit's excretions or blood. The virus can also survive and spread from carcasses, food, water, and any contaminated materials. People can spread the virus indirectly by carrying it on their clothing and shoes.

"A vaccine for RHDV2 is now available for use in Wisconsin. Rabbit owners interested in vaccinating their rabbits should contact their veterinarians for more information on the vaccine. Veterinarians may order the vaccine by contacting Medgene Labs at (605) 697-2600. For more information, visit https://medgenelabs.com/rhdv2-vaccine/.

"Although it is not required, identifying rabbits, such as with tattoos or microchips, is highly recommended to aid in demonstrating vaccination status. If using microchips, ensure there will be no interference with their use in meat rabbits. If using tattoos in registered or show rabbits, ensure the rabbits will meet registration or show requirements.

"Even with the use of vaccine, it is still recommended that owners protect rabbits by practicing good biosecurity. Biosecurity means taking simple steps every day to keep germs and viruses away from animals. These actions will significantly reduce the chance of RHDV2 or other contagious diseases affecting your rabbits."

Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) is a highly contagious disease caused by a calicivirus that affects rabbits, including wild and domesticated European rabbits (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_), from which our own domesticated rabbits are descended. Until 2020, RHDV had not been known to affect North American native rabbits or hares, such as cottontails, snowshoe hares, and jackrabbits. In the 2020-2021 outbreak in the United States, Mexico, and Canada, RHDV caused death in wildlife species of rabbits as well.

RHDV was first seen in China in 1984, but it was thought to have originated in Europe. Cases have been confirmed in 40 countries, including in Europe, the Mediterranean, Africa, Asia, North America (Mexico, United States, Canada), Australia, and New Zealand.

A new strain, RHDV2, emerged in 2010 in France; it quickly spread throughout Europe and in the Mediterranean and has replaced the original strain in many countries. In 2015, RHDV2 was detected in Australia and spread coast to coast -- about 3 million square miles (7.77 million sq km), compared with the United States' 3.8 million square miles (9.84 million sq km) -- in 18 months in the rabbit population, where it became the dominant strain, replacing RHDV1.

Signs may include:
- loss of appetite
- lethargy
- high fever
- seizures
- jaundice
- bleeding from nose, mouth, or rectum
- difficulty breathing
- sudden death

RHDV is often a very swift and sudden killer, giving little warning. Rabbits may die without showing any symptoms at all. Any sudden rabbit death is suspicious and should be reported to your veterinarian as a possible case of RHDV.

Incubation period
- RHDV1: 1-3 days. Rabbits may die within 12-36 hours to a few weeks after the onset of symptoms.
- RHDV2: 3-5 days. Previous experimental RHDV2 infection found incubation of 3-9 days until onset of symptoms, then death within 3-5 days.

Death rate (mortality)
- RHDV1: 40-100%
- RHDV2: 5-80%+. In the 2020 south west US and Mexico RHDV2 outbreak, officials reported a death rate of about 90%.

Survivors
Rabbits who survive RHDV are carriers and shed the virus for a minimum of 42 days, possibly longer.

Asymptomatic carriers
Some rabbits may have few or no signs of RHDV2 (subclinical/asymptomatic) but may shed virus for up to 2 months.

Transmission routes
Rabbits are infected by oral, nasal/respiratory, or ocular exposure to the virus, or by blood-feeding insects.

Cause of death: RHDV causes necrotizing hepatitis and may cause necrosis of the spleen. There may be internal or externally visible bleeding. Death occurs from liver failure or hemorrhage due to an impairment in the blood's ability to clot.

Durability of virus
Rabbit calicivirus is a very hardy virus, remaining viable in the environment outside a host.
- Survives 105 days at 68 deg F (20 deg C) on fabric; it remains stable for 3.5 months at room temperature
- Survives 225 days at 39 deg F (3.9 deg C) (just above freezing temperatures)
- Survives freeze/thaw cycles
- Survives heat of 122 deg F (50 deg C) for one hour

Seasonal outbreaks
Where the virus has a reservoir in wild rabbits or feral/stray domestic rabbits, seasonal outbreaks are expected year to year. In Australia, outbreaks start in fall and winter, peak in spring, and are mostly absent in summer. Seasonal fly abundance, as flies are a significant vector, may be linked with RHDV activity.

Treatment
- There is no known cure for RHDV.
- Treatment is supportive care in isolation.
- There are currently no known effective anti-viral drugs or other treatments available.
