First Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever Death at a Distance From the Outbreak Site
------------------------------------------------------------------------
KAMPALA: Ugandan Health Officials on Wed 1 Nov 2000 said that the Ebola
fever epidemic which has killed 80 people in northern Uganda has now spread
to the far south of the country with [as reported in WHO Disease Outbreaks
- Update 17 a confirmed death in the town of Mbarara. A soldier who had
been based at the army barracks in Gulu, the center of the epidemic, became
ill after moving to the barracks in Mbarara, said Sam Okware, Director
General For Health Services In Uganda's Ministry Of Health. He said that
the soldier died last Friday [27 Oct 2000 in Mbarara University Hospital,
the main hospital in the area, about 5 days after showing typical symptoms
of high fever, abdominal pain and diarrhea. Samples from the patient were
sent to the CDC (Centers for Disease Control) mobile lab. in Gulu, which
confirmed he was antigen positive.
Despite many earlier false alarms, this is the first confirmed case outside
the northern district of Gulu, where [Ebola hemorrhagic fever has killed
80 people since the outbreak began in September. Earlier in the day, Health
Officials had said they believed the disease had been brought under
control, and said the death rate was falling in Gulu district, where 250
cases have been reported. But this death in the busy commercial town of
Mbarara, which lies 265 miles south of Gulu, and about 25 miles north of
the Tanzanian border, will heighten concerns about [further spread of the
disease. Okware said a team from the Health Ministry was on its way to
Mbarara, and he had asked for help from the World Health Organization (WHO)
and the medical relief agency, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF). Experts from
the WHO and the CDC have been in Gulu for the past 2 weeks, working with
the Ugandan government, Red Cross volunteers and other agencies to try to
contain the virus.
