Regarding the question: "Is post exposure treatment the same irrespective
of the possible source (fox versus bat, for example) of exposure?" Yes, the
post-exposure treatment is the same irrespective of the source and the
place of the contamination: vaccines + immunoglobulins. Vaccines may vary
according to the virus strain used in the production. The Pitman-Moore (PM)
stain is used to produce the International Standard for Rabies Vaccine,
Human Diploïd Cell Culture Vaccine and rabies vaccine produced on Vero
cells, whereas the Flury-LEP strain is used to produce the Purified
Chick-Embryo Cell Vaccine (see: Laboratory techniques in rabies, Fourth
Edition, edited by Meslin, Kaplan, Koprowski, WHO, Geneva,1996).
As for other question, "Do rabies vaccines protect against the different
subtypes or variants of rabies viruses found throughout the world?", rabies
vaccines protect against rabies virus, serotype 1, i.e. terrestrial
carnivores all over the world and bats in the Americas. They protect also
against the new Australian Bat Lyssavirus (serotype 7), and in about 75% of
the cases, against the European Bat Lyssaviruses 1 and 2,( serotypes 5 and
6) (Herzog and al. Clin Exp. Immunol. ,1991,85, 224-230). But, at the
moment, no rabies case has been reported in patients exposed to rabid
European bats and treated with currently licensed rabies vaccines.
