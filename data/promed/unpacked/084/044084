The Florida Department of Health [DOH] in Leon County on Friday [1 Apr 2022] said it was investigating "3 confirmed cases of meningococcal disease in individuals in Tallahassee aged 18 to 22." The disease is a more serious form of meningitis, an inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord.

"Anyone who has been exposed or develops symptoms should be evaluated by a health-care provider right away," a news release said. "This is a rare but potentially devastating infection."

The swelling from meningitis typically triggers symptoms such as a headache, fever, and a stiff neck. Early symptoms may mimic the flu, with symptoms developing over several hours or over a few days.

DOH Leon's epidemiology team "is contacting people with potential or direct exposure to known cases and providing them with information and treatment options," according to the release. "This type of bacterial meningitis is not easily transmissible from person to person. It requires close contact over a period of time, or direct contact such as kissing or sharing drinks."

Sandon S. Speedling, interim health officer for DOH Leon, said his office is "working to investigate these cases and to ensure that people who have come into close contact with the patients receive antibiotics as a precautionary measure against infection."

For more information:
- Getting vaccinated is the best way to protect against meningococcal disease. DOH Leon offers meningococcal disease vaccines. For more information, call DOH Leon at 850-404-6403.
- For details on meningococcal disease, vaccines, and treatments, visit the CDC's website at <cdc.gov/meningococcal>.

[_Neisseria meningitidis_, the cause of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD), infects only humans; there is no animal reservoir, and the organism dies quickly outside the human host. _N. meningitidis_, which colonizes the mucosal membranes of the nose and throat, is spread person to person by sharing respiratory and throat secretions (e.g., coughing or kissing). Close and prolonged contact with an infected person or carrier facilitates the spread of the disease. The average incubation period is 4 days but can range between 2 and 10 days.

People at increased risk of IMD include household members and roommates of a patient with IMD, and anyone with direct contact with the patient's oral secretions, such as a boyfriend or girlfriend. These close contacts should receive antibiotics to help prevent them from getting the disease.

Meningococcal meningitis occurs most frequently in the elderly, infants, and teenagers and young adults, especially if living in group settings, such as dormitories, boarding schools, and military bases. Certain rare medical conditions and medications increase the risk for IMD, including complement component deficiencies, functional or anatomic asplenia, HIV/AIDS, and complement inhibitor medications, e.g., eculizumab (Soliris) and ravulizumab (Ultomiris).

A discussion of antibiotics used for treatment and prevention of IMD can be found in my moderator comments in a prior ProMED post (see N. meningitidis: USA, antimicrobial resistance, 2012-2016 20220401.8702352), and relevant portions of the US CDC guidance on management of a meningococcal outbreak can be found in my moderator comments in the previous ProMED post (Meningitis, meningococcal - USA: (MI) college student, frat party 20220129.8701149).

We are not told in the news report above the demographic characteristics (other than their age, 18 to 22 years), underlying medical conditions, or vaccine status of the 3 patients; epidemiologic linkages of the 3 cases; serogroup(s) of the meningococcal isolates; or timeline over which the cases occurred in the IMD outbreak in Tallahassee, Florida, USA. More information on this outbreak from knowledgeable sources would be appreciated.

Leon County (pop. 275 487 in 2010) is in the Panhandle of the US state of Florida; its county seat and the capital of the state is the city of Tallahassee (pop. 196 169 in 2020) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_County,_Florida, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallahassee,_Florida).

Tallahassee is home to 2 of Florida's major public universities, Florida State University and Florida A&M University, as well as Tallahassee Community College, with a combined enrollment of more than 70 000 students annually. (The ages of the 3 patients suggests they may be college students.)
