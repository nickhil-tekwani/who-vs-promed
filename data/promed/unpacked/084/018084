------------------
Information received on [and dated] 22 Jul 2016 from Dr Guilherme Henrique Figueiredo Marques, director, [Animal Health Department, Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food Supply of Brazil], Brasilia, Brazil

Summary
Report type: immediate notification (final report)
Date of start of the event: 10 Apr 2016
Date of confirmation of the event: 15 Jul 2016
Date event resolved: 20 Jul 2016
Reason for notification: new strain of a listed disease in the country
Causal agent: bluetongue virus
Serotype: 19
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory (advanced), necropsy
This event pertains to the whole country

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Foz do Iguacu, Parana
Date of start of the outbreak: 10 Apr 2016
Outbreak status: resolved 20 Jul 2016
Epidemiological unit: zoo
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Pygmy brocket: _Mazama nana_ (Cervidae) / 29 / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0
Affected population: Deer from the indigenous fauna (_Mazama nana_), 2 years old, held in captivity in a zoo within the ecological reserve of the Itaipu Binacional dam. The animal, which presented clinical signs and pathological injuries suitable with bluetongue, died 3 days after the start of the clinical disease.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Pygmy brocket: _Mazama nana_ (Cervidae) / 3.45 / 3.45 / 100 / 3.45
* Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: Phylogenetic analysis of the sample by the Animal virology investigation Laboratory of the Minas Gerais Federal University identified serotype 19. A bluetongue outbreak already occurred in the same area last year [2015], but with different serotypes.

Control measures
Measures applied: vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type/ Species / Test / Test date / Result
Animal virology investigation Laboratory of the Minas Gerais Federal University (Local laboratory)/ Pygmy brocket / real-time reverse transcriptase / polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 15 Jul 2016 / Positive
Animal virology investigation Laboratory of the Minas Gerais Federal University (Local laboratory)/ Pygmy brocket / serotyping / 15 Jul 2016 / Positive
Animal virology investigation Laboratory of the Minas Gerais Federal University (Local laboratory)/ Pygmy brocket / virus isolation / 15 Jul 2016 / Positive
Animal virology investigation Laboratory of the Minas Gerais Federal University (Local laboratory)/ Pygmy brocket / virus sequencing / 15 Jul 2016 / Positive
Lanagro (national laboratory)/ Pygmy brocket / real-time reverse transcriptase / polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 29 Apr 2015 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

[The location of the outbreak can be seen on the interactive map included in the OIE report at the source URL above.

Bluetongue virus (BTV) (Reoviridae: Orbivirus) is a vector-borne pathogen that causes hemorrhagic disease (HD) in ruminants, mainly sheep, and less frequently goats, buffalo, deer, antelopes and camels.
In South America, viral isolations from field samples have only been reported in Argentina, Brazil and Guyana. Serologic evidence has been reported in Chile, Perú, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Suriname and French Guyana.

In Brazil, BTV was first described in São Paulo in 1978. After that, several reports have shown that the virus is widespread all over Brazil. Serologic data can be found in the whole country, although the virus was isolated only in 2 opportunities: in 1980, BTV4 was isolated in Florida (USA) from Brazilian zebu cattle which had been quarantined; and in 2001, BTV12 was isolated from sheep showing clinical signs of bluetongue.

The few surveys that examined seroprevalence in cervids from South America failed to find a positive result. The only previous report on BTV infecting a South American deer was published this year [2016] in another _Mazama nana_ kept in captivity from the same zoo (see ProMED post # 20160119.3948490). - Mod.PMB]
