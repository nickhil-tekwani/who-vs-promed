Mildew disease strikes apples
-----------------------------
Apple farmers in [Uganda's] Kabale district are counting losses following an outbreak of the powdery mildew also known as white ash disease. The disease has so far destroyed 2000 apple trees [and] has spread to more than 238 orchards. This puts more than 23 800 apple trees at the risk of drying up.

[Farmers say that] some of the extension workers have little knowledge about apples. The Kabale district Apple Growers Association says the disease attacks the branches [and] the only available remedy is to destroy [the branch] to avoid further spread. They caution the farmers to be extra careful where they pick the seedlings from. Rodgers Akatwijuka, National Agricultural Advisory Services, says they are working closely with the National Agricultural Research and Development Institute to find a lasting solution to the problem.

He explains that the disease is caused by the fungus _Podosphaera leucotricha_, which attacks the buds, blossoms, leaves, new shoots, and apple fruit. He says that the disease interferes with the proper functioning of leaves, reduces shoot growth [and] fruit set, and produces a netlike russet on the fruit. He urges farmers to choose varieties that are resistant to powdery mildew.

[The powdery mildew group of fungi includes many species in a number of genera. They cause serious losses in important crops including cereals, hops, sunflower, grapevine, and many fruit and vegetable crops, but each species is specific to a number of hosts.

The powdery mildew species affecting apple, crabapple, and pear is _Podosphaera leucotricha_, as stated above. Symptoms may include powdery growth on leaves, new shoots, buds, flowers and young twigs, as well as leaf distortion, mottling on fruit (on some apple varieties), and necrosis on branches. Heavy infection leads to reduced photosynthetic ability and decreased plant vigour. Economic losses are due to reduced fruit quality and yield.

The fungus overwinters as mycelium inside infected leaf buds and starts to spread when buds open in spring. Spores are spread by wind, water, and mechanical means. Disease management may include repeated fungicide sprays starting before bud opening and cultural practices (winter pruning, orchard sanitation) to reduce inoculum and improve air circulation in orchards. Apple cultivars vary in their susceptibility to powdery mildew and some resistant varieties are available.
