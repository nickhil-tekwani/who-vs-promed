DRC: Unidentified fever kills 12 diamond miners in Maniema, OCHA says
---------------------
A local official of the UN humanitarian office, OCHA, said on Friday that
12 diamond miners working in a pit 84 km northwest of the town of Punia in
the Democratic Republic of Congo's Maniema Province are dead and many
others are seriously ill from what appears to be a hemorrhagic fever.
"Those infected vomit blood," Gerson Brandao, the humanitarian affairs
officer for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs
(OCHA) in Maniema, said.
"This is likely an acute respiratory infection that has mutated into a
hemorrhagic fever," he added.
Brandao said 34 people were currently suspected of having the disease.
He said the disease could have been caused by the condition in Punia and at
the pit where 10 500 miners recently arrived following news of the
discovery of diamonds. He said the health inspector for the Punia Health
Zone had reported there was no drinking water in the area and that the
miners worked in poor health conditions.
Brandao said UNICEF had sent a mobile health clinic to the area while the
NGO Merlin and other humanitarian organisations were informing people on
methods to prevent further transmission of the disease.

[The town of Punia is located in the northern part of Maniema province near
the border with Orientale province where there have been outbreaks of
hemorrhagic fever in the past (a good map of provinces with major towns can
be found at
<http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/drcongo.pdf>). Maniema
province has not been implicated in outbreaks of one of the viral
hemorrhagic fevers in the past. As can be seen from prior ProMED-mail
postings listed below, neighboring Orientale province has had outbreaks of
Marburg hemorrhagic fever in the past, and Ebola virus has been implicated
in outbreaks more westerly provinces of Bandundu (Kikwit) and Equateur near
the border with the Republic of the Congo.
One intriguing mention in the above newswire is that the disease seems to
start as a respiratory disease and then becomes ("mutates into") a
hemorrhagic fever. This is reminiscent of the outbreak of pneumonic plague
in miners in Orientale province (Ituri) earlier this year. Pneumonic
plague is associated with hemoptysis (coughing up blood), which may be
confused with hematemesis (vomiting up blood).
Further speculation in the absence of more information on the clinical
presentation of the cases is hazardous other than to mention that the
differential diagnosis of hemorrhagic fevers in the country (Democratic
Republic of the Congo) would include yellow fever and malaria among other
diseases.
More information on this outbreak from knowledgeable sources (such as our
colleagues in humanitarian organizations "on the scene" as mentioned in the
newswire above) would be very much appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
