According to a report completed by the Florida Department of Health, the growth of _Legionella_ bacteria was found in a hot water heater at the fitness area of IslandWalk.

Testing was also done on the community swimming pool and spa but returned negative results.

Despite the negative finding, the health department says it believes the pool and spa area are where people came in contact with the bacteria.

13 people tested positive for the disease in late February [2018].

A North Port community was terrified after a Legionnaires' outbreak. Now, health officials have identified a 2nd source of the potentially deadly disease.

Last month [February 2018], residents say 11 people from the Islandwalk at the West Villages were rushed to the hospital for Legionnaires' disease. It's a severe form of pneumonia that could be fatal. Now the question is, where did it come from?

Officials from the Florida Department of Health investigated and determined the disease likely came from the pool and spa.

They've just announced the _Legionella_ bacterium was also found in the fitness center's water heater. "Because the temperature of the water heater was lower than it should have been, it's not surprising that we did find it there," said Environmental Health Director Tom Higginbotham.

Health officials do not believe the maintenance staff were negligent. "I don't believe so; _Legionella_ is ubiquitous in the environment; it's everywhere. It can grow in a hot water that is not properly maintained. ... This was a low use hot water heater that wasn't serving any showers, just hand sinks, so I don't see any negligence at this point," said Higginbotham.

Health officials have not seen any new cases in nearly a month, so they believe the threat has been stopped.

They add that the water heater is being replaced, and the spa and pools have been thoroughly sanitized. Health officials can't stress enough that it's important to properly maintain your water heater. "Hot water heaters should be kept warm enough, around 140 F [60 C], to prevent an environment that is favorable for the growth of _Legionella_," explained Higginbotham.

It's also equally important to maintain your hot tubs and pools. If you suspect your community pool or spa is not being maintained well, contact management or reach out to the Florida Department of Health.

Tests for Legionnaires' disease conducted by the Florida Department of Health in Sarasota County found a positive culture for the bacteria [_Legionella_] in a hot water heater in the fitness area of the clubhouse at the IslandWalk at the West Villages development.

Tests on the common pool and spa area came back negative, health department spokesman Steve Huard said, but the spa is still believed to be the source of the Legionnaires' outbreak that was 1st reported on 23 Feb 2018. "It just shows us that the chlorine that could have been added before we were able to test negated the tests for the _Legionella_," he added. "Our epidemiological investigation leads us to the spa, even to this day."

Tests of other water sources, including exposed irrigation ponds, also came back negative.

[A total of 13 people developed legionnaires' disease in February 2018 in IslandWalk, a gated community of single-family houses with a clubhouse and pool/spa in North Port, Florida (http://www.islandwalkvillage.com). No new cases have developed in nearly a month, so they believe the outbreak is over.

Apparently, the community's pool/spa is still the suspected source for the outbreak on epidemiological grounds, despite negative culture results for these sites, which were invalidated by their prior treatment with chlorine. A low-use water heater in the fitness center that supplied water only for sinks to wash hands, although positive for _Legionella_, was not believed to be the source.

No mention is given of genotyping the _Legionella_ isolates. Genotyping of clinical isolates, if available, would have helped establish a common source outbreak, if the genotypes matched. Matching the genotypes of clinical isolates with the genotypes of environmental isolates would have helped establish transmission pathways. However, if the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping.

North Port is a city with a population of 57 357 residents in 2010 in southern Sarasota County, Florida, United States. Located just north of the town of Port Charlotte (in Charlotte County, Florida), North Port is part of the North Port-Bradenton-Sarasota Metropolitan Statistical Area (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Port,_Florida).
