--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Coccidioidomycosis, also known as Valley fever, is caused by inhalation of spores of the soil-dwelling fungi _Coccidioides_ spp. Although most illness is mild, coccidioidomycosis can cause severe disease resulting in hospitalization or death. On 28 Jul 2021, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) notified the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) of 7 wildland firefighters from 2 crews who had respiratory illness. Crew A (19 members) and crew B (21 members) had worked on wildfires in late June 2021 near the Tehachapi Mountains, a California region with historically high coccidioidomycosis incidence. Among the 7 symptomatic firefighters, 3 cases of coccidioidomycosis were laboratory-confirmed; 2 patients developed severe disease. All 3 firefighters with confirmed coccidioidomycosis reported working in dusty conditions without wearing respiratory protection. Because no vaccine for coccidioidomycosis currently exists, correct use of respiratory protection is important for preventing coccidioidomycosis, especially in regions with high disease incidence.

During 17 Jul-4 Aug 2021, the 7 ill firefighters each visited an emergency department 2 or 3 times with cough, chest pain, or shortness of breath; all received negative test results for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. From the 7 firefighters, 3 were hospitalized, had serologic test results that were positive for coccidioidomycosis, and were treated with antifungal medication. CDPH interviewed these 3 patients and reviewed their medical records. Coccidioidomycosis serologic test results for the other 4 firefighters were negative; however, repeat serology is often suggested if coccidioidomycosis is suspected. Two of these 4 were retested and results remained negative and were managed in ambulatory clinics, and 2 were lost to follow-up. All confirmed cases occurred in patients who worked on crew B, resulting in an attack rate for confirmed cases of 14.3% (3 of 21).

The 3 confirmed cases occurred in men aged 25-34 years, none of whom had any remarkable past medical history. Two patients reported Hispanic or Latino race or ethnicity, and the other did not report race or ethnicity. Length of hospital stay ranged from 8 to 17 days. All 3 patients were treated with the antifungal fluconazole; interval from illness onset to commencement of treatment ranged from 10 to 12 days.

Illness onset and work history dates suggested that _Coccidioides_ exposure likely occurred during a 3-day fire near the Tehachapi Mountains. All 3 patients reported digging trenches and "mopping up" the fire, which included digging and moving soil, with heavy dust exposure and without respiratory protection. All had been fit-tested for a respirator and reported having been trained to minimize dust exposure.

Coccidioidomycosis outbreaks have been reported among wildland firefighters in California, where job-related soil and dust exposure in areas with coccidioidomycosis increases the risk for infection (1,2). The fungus that causes coccidioidomycosis is endemic in the soil in the southwestern USA, particularly Arizona and California, and in parts of Mexico and Central and South America; endemicity is also likely expanding (3). Use of respiratory protection is challenging in wildland firefighting because of concerns about respirator flammability and compatibility with other equipment, as well as the hot, strenuous nature of the emergency-related work. Despite these challenges, fire agencies could consider evaluating the feasibility of respirator use under specific conditions (e.g., during dust-generating activities away from active burning) and adopt policies accordingly.

Early recognition of coccidioidomycosis and disease management are essential to mitigating severity (4). CDPH has previously recommended that all California wildland firefighters receive coccidioidomycosis training regarding exposure risks, prevention, and when to seek care (2); CAL FIRE policy is to conduct this training at the beginning of each fire season. Based on findings of this investigation, CDPH recommends safety briefings on coccidioidomycosis prevention, such as use of respirator protection or wetting of soil before disturbance, before deployment to, and return from, possible areas with endemic _Coccidioides_ spp. During this outbreak, CAL FIRE was proactive in recommending coccidioidomycosis testing; cases were diagnosed within 12 days, compared with a median of 55 days from illness onset to diagnosis reported in an Arizona study (5). California health care providers should ask patients with respiratory illness about work location, high-risk occupations, and exposure to soil disturbance. Providers should also consider that signs and symptoms of coccidioidomycosis might be similar to those of COVID-19 to avoid unnecessary delays in diagnosis. As frequency of coccidioidomycosis and wildfires increase in California, exploration of protective equipment and additional training are needed to better protect wildland firefighters (3).

[Coccidioidomycosis, commonly known as valley fever, is a fungal disease caused by inhalation of spores of _Coccidioides immitis_ or _C. posadasii_, dimorphic saprophytic fungi that grow in soil as a mycelium that break off into airborne spores. The spores, known as arthroconidia, become airborne during conditions that disturb the soil like the activities performed by the firefighters. In the host organism, the inhaled arthrospores develop into spherules, which produce as many as 800 endospores; endospores, when released into tissues, can mature into new spherules. Most patients who become infected following exposure are asymptomatic but have immunological evidence of coccidioidomycosis. Within some endemic communities in the central valley of California, nearly the entire population has serological evidence of prior infection. - Mod.LL
