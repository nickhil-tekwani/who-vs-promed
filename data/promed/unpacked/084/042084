[1] Dementia: risk
Date: Tue 9 Feb 2021
Source: The New York Times [edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/09/health/covid-dementia-risk.html


People with dementia had significantly greater risk of contracting the coronavirus, and they were much more likely to be hospitalized and die from it, than people without dementia, a new study [see reference below] of millions of medical records in the United States has found.

Their risk could not be entirely explained by characteristics common to people with dementia that are known risk factors for COVID-19: old age, living in a nursing home, and having conditions like obesity, asthma, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. After researchers adjusted for those factors, Americans with dementia were still twice as likely to have gotten COVID-19 as of late last summer [2020].

The study found that Black people with dementia were nearly 3 times as likely as White people with dementia to become infected with the virus, a finding that experts said most likely reflected the fact that people of color generally have been disproportionately harmed during the pandemic.

Maria Carrillo, chief science officer of the Alzheimer's Association, which runs the journal that published the study, Alzheimer's and Dementia, said in an interview, "One of the things that has come from this COVID-19 situation is that we should be pointing out these disparities."

The study was led by researchers at Case Western Reserve University who analyzed electronic health records of 61.9 million people age 18 and older in the United States from 1 Feb through 21 Aug 2020. The data, collected by IBM Watson Health Explorys, came from 360 hospitals and 317 000 healthcare providers across all 50 states and represented 1/5 of the American population, the authors said.

The researchers found that out of 15 770 patients with COVID-19 in the records analyzed, 810 of them also had dementia. When the researchers adjusted for general demographic factors -- age, sex, and race -- they found that people with dementia had more than three times the risk of getting COVID-19. When they adjusted for COVID-specific risk factors like nursing home residency and underlying physical conditions, the gap closed somewhat, but people with dementia were still twice as likely to become infected.

Dr Yaffe said there could also be a "frailty element" to people with dementia, including a lack of mobility and muscle tone, that could affect their resilience to infections.

Dr Carrillo noted that coronavirus infection was associated with an inflammatory response that has been shown to affect blood vessels and other aspects of the circulatory system. Many people with dementia already have vascular impairment, which may be compounded or amplified by COVID-19.

Indeed, the study authors subdivided patients by the type of dementia listed in the electronic records and found that people designated as having vascular dementia had a greater risk for infection than people designated as having Alzheimer's disease or other types.

But Dr Langa and Dr Yaffe cautioned that there was significant overlap between types of dementia. Many patients have both Alzheimer's pathology and vascular pathology, they said, and physicians who are not specialists may not distinguish subtypes in providing codes for electronic records.

In examining the risk of hospitalization and death for COVID-19 patients with dementia, the researchers did not adjust for demographics like age or whether they lived in nursing homes or had underlying medical conditions. They found that COVID-19 patients with dementia were 2.6 times as likely to have been hospitalized during the 1st 6 months of the pandemic as those without dementia. They were 4.4 times as likely to die.

Black people with COVID-19 and dementia were significantly more likely to be hospitalized than White people who had both diseases. The authors did not find a significant difference in the mortality rate for Black and White coronavirus patients with dementia, although they wrote that the number of deaths analyzed, 170, might be too small to provide a solid conclusion about that.

Experts noted that one limitation to the study was that researchers did not have access to socioeconomic information, which could provide increased understanding of patients' risk factors.

Dr Langa also noted that the data reflected only people who have interacted with the healthcare system, so it doesn't include "more isolated and poorer patients that have a harder time getting to doctors." Consequently, he said, the study may be "an underestimate of the greater COVID-19 infection risk for those with dementia."

Epub ahead of print. PMID: 33559975; https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.12296

The investigators adjusted for demographics and COVID‐19 risk factors (cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, obesity, asthma, chronic kidney disease), many of which are also risk factors for dementia. In addition, they adjusted for living situation, that is, nursing homes or chronic care facilities where contact among residents might be high. It is interesting that as with the general population, Blacks with dementia were affected more than Whites with dementia.

The authors note that the damaged blood-brain barrier in patients with dementia "predisposes them to bacterial and viral infections, and the memory impairment associated with dementia may interfere with the patient's ability to comply with preventive measures for COVID‐19." Both factors likely contribute to the higher rates of infection in individuals with dementia. But it must be kept in mind that the findings are associational, not causal. Further studies must be conducted to determine causality. Thank you to Mary Marshall who also submitted this report - Mod.LK]

[2] UK: new symptoms, REACT
Date: Thu 11 Feb 2021 01:37 UK
Source: Sky News [edited]
https://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-linked-with-new-set-of-symptoms-according-to-study-of-over-a-million-people-12214163


Chills, loss of appetite, headache, and muscle aches could be a sign of COVID-19 infection, according to new findings.

Based on swab tests and questionnaires taken from June [2020] up until last month [January 2021] as part of Imperial College London's REACT [real-time assessment of community transmission] study of over 1 million people, those with the symptoms above were more likely to test positive for the virus.

This is in addition to the "classic" symptoms of COVID-19 already included in NHS guidance, which are: fever, new persistent cough, loss of sense of smell and/or taste.

The more symptoms people showed, the more likely they were to test positive for the virus -- although the study pointed out that around 60% of infected people did not report any symptoms at all in the week leading up to their test.

There was some variation in symptoms depending on age, but chills were associated with COVID-19 across all age groups.

Headaches were most reported in young people aged 5-17, although they were less likely to report the classic symptoms of fever and persistent cough.

Appetite loss was most common in 18-54-year-olds as well as those over 55, and muscle aches in people aged 18-54.

People in England are currently encouraged to get an NHS test if they have any of the "classic" symptoms.

The researchers have estimated that if everyone who had these symptoms got tested, around half of the symptomatic coronavirus infections would be picked up. But if these new symptoms are included, they believe this number would rise to around three quarters.

The research also suggested those infected with the new coronavirus variant first discovered in Kent [B.1.1.7] could be less likely to have a loss or change to their sense of smell, while the proportion of people with a new persistent cough increased.

Scientists compared symptoms and swab test results collected in November and December [2020], when the new variant was estimated to make up around 16% of infections, with similar data collected in January [2021] -- when it was thought to be behind half of the cases.

[The REACT (real-time assessment of community transmission) https://www.reactstudy.org/ is an important research study led by Imperial College London and Ipsos MORI [market research company] which seeks to understand how many people are currently infected or have been infected with the COVID-19 virus.

What is REACT?
https://www.imperial.ac.uk/medicine/research-and-impact/groups/react-study/faqs/

The REACT programme is a series of studies that are seeking to improve understanding of how the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing across England. To do this, the programme is carrying out 2 major pieces of work that are looking at the possibility of using home sampling and testing to track the infection.

The first, REACT1, will roll out antigen (swab) tests to 100 000 randomly selected people across England. This will examine how widely the virus has spread and how many people are currently infected with the coronavirus.

The second, REACT2, will assess a number of different antibody tests to see how accurate they are and how easily people can use them at home. Antibody tests are designed to tell individuals if they have had an immune response to the infection. These tests will offer an indication of how far the virus has spread across the country and what proportion of the population have been infected and recovered.

[3] E484K mutation
Date: Fri 5 Feb 2021
Source: BMJ [abridged, edited]
https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n359


ref: Wise J. Covid-19: The E484K mutation and the risks it poses. BMJ. 2021 Feb 5; 372: n359. doi: 10.1136/bmj.n359. PMID: 33547053
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The mutation E484K, first identified in the South African SARS-CoV-2 variant, has now been identified in the UK fast-spreading variant, prompting fears the virus is evolving further and could become resistant to vaccines.

What do we know about the E484K mutation?
The E484K mutation is not a new variant in itself, it's a mutation which occurs in different variants and has already been found in the B.1.351 [first isolated in South Africa] and B.1.1.28 [first isolated in Brazil variants]. The mutation is in the spike protein and appears to have an impact on the body's immune response and, possibly, vaccine efficacy. On [1 Feb 2021] Public Health England (PHE) announced that the COVID-19 Genomics (COG-UK) consortium had identified this same E484K mutation in 11 samples carrying the variant B.1.1.7 [first isolated in the UK; sometimes called the Kent variant], after analysing 214 159 sequences.

Where has it been identified in the UK?
PHE confirmed to The BMJ that they have now identified 11 cases of the UK B1.1.7 variant carrying the E484K mutation around the Bristol area and 40 cases of the original SARS-C0V-2 virus carrying the same E484K mutation in the Liverpool area. Public health officials are carrying out enhanced contact tracing, additional laboratory analysis, and testing in these areas.

Is this mutation something to worry about?
E484K is called an escape mutation because it helps the virus slip past the body's immune defences. Ravindra Gupta at the University of Cambridge and colleagues have confirmed that the new B.1.1.7 plus E484K variant substantially increases the amount of serum antibody needed to prevent infection of cells. We already know that the B.1.1.7 variant is more transmissible so a combination of a faster spreading virus that is also better at evading immunity is worrying -- if it isn't stopped it would outcompete the older B.1.1.7 variant.

Another concern is that variant B.1.351 might be able to more efficiently reinfect people who have previously been infected with the original form of the virus. Lawrence Young, a virologist and professor of molecular oncology at Warwick University, said, "This is likely to be, in part, because the E484K mutation may weaken the immune response and also impact the longevity of the neutralising antibody response. So B.1.1.7 variants carrying the E484K mutation may be more efficient at reinfection."

Will vaccines work against these emerging variants?
There has been research showing that the current vaccines work against the UK B.1.1.7 variant without the E484K mutation. However, recent clinical trials by Novavax and Johnson & Johnson showed that their new vaccines were less effective in South Africa compared with the UK or US, which is presumably because of the high level of virus carrying the E484K mutation. Even so, Novavax reported a 60% efficacy of their vaccine in South Africa which is still a fairly good response, equivalent to that of the influenza vaccine. And scientists say that vaccines can be redesigned and tweaked to be a better match for the new variants in a matter of months. The Oxford AstraZeneca team, for example, announced they were already looking at updating their vaccine to make it more effective against the mutations that are being seen and it could be available by the autumn. It is possible it could take the form of a one dose booster which is updated and rolled out every year.

What is the UK doing to monitor the spread of variants?
The UK has identified 105 cases of the South African variant B.1.351, so far. Most could be linked to travel, but 11 cases could not, meaning it is spreading within the local community. As a result, the government announced it would carry out additional surge testing and sequencing in eight postcode areas in England. This is likely to be the tip of the iceberg, however, as less than 1 in 10 samples from people who test positive are sequenced and many people never get tested in the 1st place.

How can we stop new variants emerging?
The SARS-CoV-2 virus makes around 1 or 2 mutations a month. This sounds quite a low number and is in fact lower than for other viruses, including influenza. The more the virus circulates, however, the more opportunity it has to change. So anything that can be done to suppress spread of the virus will help to limit new variants emerging, including distancing, mask wearing, and handwashing.
Will closing the UK borders help?

From [15 Feb 2021] UK residents and Irish nationals travelling to the UK from 33 "red list" countries will have to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days. Non-UK travellers are currently banned from entry. However, Labour has criticised the fact that this measure will only be in place 50 days after the first B.1.351 variant was identified in the UK and are also calling for the scheme to be extended to all international travellers. Jonathan Stoye from the Francis Crick Institute said, "Under conditions of very high levels of virus replication even the most stringent of border controls, although they may delay spread, are unlikely to prevent the appearance of new variants."

[Mutations will continue to be detected as the virus is still being transmitted at a high frequency. Those mutations that give the virus an advantage, such as escaping the immune system, faster transmission, shorter incubation period, or higher titer, will have a selective advantage and will become more prevalent in the population. It is important that viruses from all countries be sequenced to follow changes in the genetics and the biological consequences of those changes analyzed.

[4] Therapeutic: Eli Lilly combination antibody drug for COVID-19
Date: Wed 10 Feb 2021
Source: Al Jazeera, Bloomberg report [abridged, edited]
https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/2/10/bb-eli-lillys-covid-antibody-drug-combination-gets-us-nod


Eli Lilly & Co.'s combination antibody drug for COVID-19 was cleared for emergency use by US regulators, providing doctors with a treatment option that is expected to be better able to combat new coronavirus mutations.

The Food and Drug Administration authorized the treatment for use in COVID-19 positive adults and children 12 and older who are at high risk of developing severe forms of the disease or progressing to the hospital, according to a fact sheet posted Tuesday [9 Feb 2012] by the agency.

The combo treatment is the 2nd antibody therapy from the Indianapolis-based drugmaker to gain emergency authorization from the FDA. In November [2020], the agency cleared bamlanivimab, one of the 2 antibodies used in the cocktail, for use in non-hospitalized, high-risk patients with mild-to-moderate symptoms of COVID-19. Bamlanivimab, developed with AbCellera Biologics Inc., mimics the immune system's virus-fighting powers.

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. also gained FDA authorization for a product combining 2 antibodies last year [2020].

Many drugmakers, from AstraZeneca Plc to Bristol Myers Squibb Co., are developing products to compete in the increasingly crowded field.

Lilly's newly authorized combination includes a 700 milligram dose of bamlanivimab, and a 1400 milligram dose of another antibody called etesevimab. The tandem will be supplied in separate single-dose vials, but administered together using a single infusion bag, according to the FDA. Patients must get the infusion as soon as possible after a positive COVID-19 test or within 10 days of symptom onset.

With additional manufacturing help from Amgen Inc., Lilly said it will produce up to one million doses of etesevimab for administration with bamlanivimab by mid-2021. The companies have already made 100 000 doses of etesevimab, and another 150 000 doses will be made available throughout the first quarter.

Underlying data
---------------
In late January [2021], Lilly reported results from a late-stage trial showing that a combination of bamlanivimab and etesevimab cut the chances of hospitalizations and deaths by 70% in high-risk patients.

Lilly's study of the cocktail found no difference between the monotherapy and combination in such outcomes.

Despite being touted as potential bridges to a vaccine, uptake of the complicated antibody medicines has been slow. Healthcare providers have struggled to put in place the proper infusion clinics necessary to administer them, doctors have been reluctant to prescribe them based on limited late-stage efficacy data, and patients have had difficulties figuring out where to get them.

On Tuesday [9 Feb 2021], the FDA authorized Lilly's monotherapy to be given in 16 minutes, a reduction from the previous requirement of an hour-long infusion.

The new combination therapy can be given in 21 minutes.

The shift in regulatory guidance was made in response to feedback from nurses and doctors, and is "aimed at reducing the burden on the healthcare system," according to Lilly.

US health officials, including the top infectious disease expert, Anthony Fauci, have also said that the treatments could be less effective against new fast-spreading virus variants that first surfaced in South Africa and Brazil.

Etesevimab was licensed by Lilly from Junshi Biosciences, which developed it with the Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Science. The US drugmaker decided to pursue a combination of bamlanivimab and etesevimab in hopes it would prove more robust against variants.

"With the risk of resistance emerging as various strains of the virus arise, bamlanivimab and etesevimab together could potentially allow efficacy against a broader range of naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 variants as these new strains spread around the world," Lilly Chief Scientific Officer Dan Skovronsky said in a statement.

Skovronsky previously said he expects use of bamlanivimab to shift toward the combination around the middle of this year [2021].

[The combination drug therapy is administered by infusion in only 21 minutes and cuts the chances of hospitalizations and deaths by 70% in high risk patients. That is very impressive! Yet it would be ideal if the drugs could be administered by a less difficult pathway, making them more accessible. - Mod.LK]

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 14.6%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 6.2%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 22.6% decrease in daily reported cases and a 2.4% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported cases almost 400 000 newly confirmed infections daily in the past 24 hours with over 107.3 million cumulative reported cases and with over 2.34 million reported deaths. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, even in the face of overall decreasing reports. The Eastern Mediterranean countries have been demonstrating decreasing case counts while the Western Pacific and African countries are increasing in reported cases. - Mod.UBA]
