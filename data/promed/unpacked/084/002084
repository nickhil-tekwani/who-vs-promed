Six polio cases have been reported in the southeastern zone after a long time, public health officials say, expressing their concern about the cases. They said 5 of the cases were detected in Khost and one in Paktika province.

Dr. Habib, an official at the Immunization Regional Office, said he was in touch with the Public Health Ministry and provincial officials to prevent an increase in polio cases.

He said some people were reluctant to vaccinate their children based on various rumors but religious scholars of Deoband, Jerusalem, Afghanistan, Pakistan and some other religious institutions had issued fatwas [a legal pronouncement in Islam. - CopyEd AO] in this regard.

He said polio vaccine was imported to Afghanistan from Indonesia and India. "Polio has been eradicated from all over the world, with only Afghanistan and Pakistan remaining."

Dr. Walaat Khan Ahmadzai, head of the department, told Pajhwok Afghan News that about 40 000 children in Zurmat, Rohani Baba and Jani Khel districts were still unvaccinated against polio. "We told them that the polio vaccine is administered door-to-door, but the Taliban say it should be given to children in clinics, which is a big reason. Currently, all our teams in Paktika are working in all areas."

The last case of polio in Paktika was reported in 2013.

[Last week's global summary from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative had the following report for Afghanistan: "54 cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported: 2 each in Farah and Khost, 14 in Hilmand, 1 each in Kabul, Kunar, Kunduz, Logar, and Paktika, 19 in Kandahar, 4 in Uruzgan, and 4 each in Wardak and Zabul. There are now 214 cVDPV2 cases reported in 2020."

This new report mentions 5 cases in Paktika and 1 in Khost. Since the report from last week only mentions 1 case from Paktika and 2 from Khost (due to cVDPV2 - circulating vaccine derived polio virus type 2), the key questions are: Are the cases due to cVVDPV or are they due to the WPV (wild poliovirus)? And, are these entirely new cases, not included in last week's report? Clarification from knowledgeable sources would be appreciated.

A map of Afghanistan showing provinces is available at https://www.worldatlas.com/maps/afghanistan (scroll past the 1st map). Both Khost and Paktika provinces border with Pakistan Blochistan, in the known WPV1 corridor as well, where a new case was reported in the past few days (see Poliomyelitis update (22): Pakistan (BA) 20201220.8033764). - Mod.MPP
