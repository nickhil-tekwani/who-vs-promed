More than 100 school children between the ages of 5 and 12 were poisoned
after eating chicken pies and drinking a nutritional supplement. Symptoms
included vomiting, fever, headache, and abdominal pain.
All patients attended the same school, in Terron Colorado, where last Fri 24
Jan 2003 they ate a snack provided by the school: a chicken pie and 2
glasses of "Bienestarina", a nutritional supplement, one in the morning &
one in the afternoon. The first 10 cases fell ill on Saturday afternoon,
with many more coming to the health center on Saturday night.
All the sick children received oral rehydratation therapy, pain relievers,
and antibiotics.
According to the school principal, for the last 3 years the school has
received the snack through a joint program with the Colombian Institute of
Family Welfare and the Cali "Alimentar" Foundation. This is the first time
that there has been a case of food poisoning of such magnitude The only
change in the program is that, as of last Friday, the Foundation is in
charge of processing the food, which was previously done by the school. As
of 26 Jan 2003, foundation representatives could not be reached for comment.

[There is not sufficient information in this report to identify the etiology
of this outbreak. The incubation period was not short enough (less than 12
hours) for a preformed toxin-type illness from _S. aureus_ or _B. cereus_
to be considered, & in any case such illnesses are not associated with
fever, nor do they require antimicrobial therapy. As the incubation period
was more than 18 hours, bacterial or viral contamination would be most
likely.
Bienestarina is a mixture of powdered milk, soy flour, any cereal flour
(rice, wheat, or corn), vitamins and minerals. Powdered skim milk has been
implicated in food poisoning outbreaks in the UK, due to _Salmonella_ and
_E.coli_, & Japan,due to staphylococcal enterotoxin -- see refs. below. -
