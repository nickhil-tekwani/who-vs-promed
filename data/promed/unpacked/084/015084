[1] General overview

During the month of August [2007], local health authorities of the
province of Ravenna, Region Emilia-Romagna, Italy, detected an
unusually high number of cases of febrile illness in Castiglione di
Cervia & Castiglione di Ravenna, 2 small villages divided by a river.
At the end of the month, clinical and epidemiological investigations
carried out by the local Health Units in collaboration with the
Region and the Reference Laboratory of the Istituto Superiore di
Sanita in Rome, suggested an arbovirus as the possible cause of the
outbreak. Serological testing and PCR confirmed the diagnosis of
chikungunya fever [virus]. In addition, the chikungunya virus was
detected by PCR in _Aedes albopictus_, which is considered to be the
most likely vector for this outbreak.
The case definition used includes high fever and joint pain and/or
rash and/or asthenia, and, for cases with no apparent link with the 2
initially affected villages, or with areas affected by secondary
clusters, laboratory confirmation.
Number of cases
--------------------
To date (4 Sep 2007), a total of 197 cases have been reported. Of
these, 166 fulfill the case-definition criteria: 147 are from the
initial outbreak area of Castiglione di Cervia or Castiglione di
Ravenna, whereas 19 are from secondary clusters in neighbouring
suburbs of the towns of Cesena (13 cases) and Cervia (6 cases). The
remaining 31 suspected cases need further epidemiological
investigation (i.e. affected areas visited in the last 14 days)
and/or laboratory confirmation. These cases, with no apparent link
with the main affected areas, are scattered throughout the region;
their blood samples have not been tested yet.
The index case is believed to be a foreigner coming from an affected
area in the Indian subcontinent and not resident in Castiglione. He
arrived in Italy on 21 Jun [2007] and developed symptoms 2 days later
when he was in Castiglione di Cervia.
The peak of the epidemic curve occurred during the 3rd week of August
[2007]. Other sporadic cases have been recently detected in
neighbouring areas, but the epidemic curve shows a decreasing trend
in Castiglione di Cervia and Castiglione di Ravenna.
Clinical presentation
---------------------
In the large majority of the patients, the disease was mild and
self-limiting. Preliminary data from Castiglione show that fever
lasted for a few days in most patients and a macular rash appeared in
more than 50 percent of cases; however, arthralgia was intense and
often persistent even after the abatement of fever. Only one death
occurred, in an 83-year-old man with severe underlying conditions.
Control measures
--------------------
An active surveillance system based on general practitioners and
hospital emergency units was set up in the whole region on 29 Aug
[2007]. Control measures implemented include the use of insecticides
(pyrethroids and antilarval products) in public as well as private
sites within 100 metres [328 feet] around the residence of all
confirmed and suspected cases, and communication to the public to
inspire active involvement in vector control measures and general
health education. A protocol on how to measure the efficacy of the
control measures is being implemented.
A surveillance system for monitoring _Aedes albopictus_ distribution
has been active in the whole of the Emilia-Romagna Region since 2006.
Surveillance for chikungunya infection in _A. albopictus_ is being
considered. Blood, organ and tissue donation has been suspended in
the affected area, i.e., Ravenna municipality, Cervia, Cesena,
Cesenatico [for fear of accidentally transmitting the virus from an
asymptomatic donor to recipient. - Mod.JW]

- Dr. Roland Hubner, Scientific Collaborator, FPS Public Health,
Brussels, for also providing this same report;
- Naomi Bryant, Information Officer, National Travel Health Network
and Centre, United Kingdom, who sent a similar Euro WHO report:
(<http://www.euro.who.int/surveillance/outbreaks/20070904_1>);
- ProMED Rapporteur Mary Marshall who provided a similar Reuters report:

The outbreak has attracted much attention as the first autochthonous
chikungunya virus outbreak in Europe. As the WHO/Euro report (cited
above) states, "Given the presence of the competent vector documented
in at least 12 European countries (Albania, Italy, France, Belgium,
Montenegro, Switzerland, Greece, Spain, Croatia, the Netherlands,
Slovenia & Bosnia-Herzegovina) as well as favourable climatic
conditions for the vector to persist in the coming few months in the
Mediterranean basin, countries should remain vigilant for the
emergence of this infectious disease."
The same can be said for other countries harboring _Aedes albopictus_
or _Ae. aegypti_, such as those in the Americas.

[2] _Aedes albopictus_ positive
Date: 4 Sep 2007
From:Dr. Michele Dottori
<michele.dottori@bs.izs.it>

Chikungunya virus infection has been confirmed in _Aedes albopictus_
captured in Castiglione di Cervia, a village in the province of
Ravenna, Italy, where an outbreak of the disease involved more than
150 people since mid July 2007. The insects were captured by experts
of Centro Agricoltura e Ambiente in Crevalcore in collaboration with
the Health Department of Ravenna. The viral RNA has been detected by
2 different PCR protocols (RT-nPCR proposed by Pffefer et al. in J.
Vet. Med. B. 49,49-54, 2002, and a Real Time PCR Taqman proposed by
Pastorino et al. in J. Virol. Methods 124, 2005 65-71) in the Reggio
Emilia Unit of Istituto Zooprofilattico della Lombardia e dell'
Emilia Romagna. Attempts at viral isolation and sequencing of the
viral genome amplified by PCR are ongoing at the laboratories of the
same institute in Brescia.
