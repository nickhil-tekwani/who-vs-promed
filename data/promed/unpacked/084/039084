AEROSOLS VS VECTOR TRANSMISSION
===============================
[As the discussion "Aerosol transmission" had acquired a mixed life
sdometimes with and sometimes without vectors, I have generated a
new title to cover comparisons of the two methologies. "Aerosol
transmission" will be limited to aerosols. MH-J Promed Acting Moderator-]

Greetings...
You mentioned that the risk of transmission of HIV from a mosquito is
quite low -- and I concur. What I am curious about, however, is if that
will change as HIV/AIDS becomes more and more part of the patchwork of
human existence, and as it spreads to more and more people in so doing.
It would seem to me that the more people are infected, the greater a chance
there will be of mosquito-transmitted HIV infection.

Subject: Re: PROMED: Aerosol transmission (5)
This is more of a question not on the topic of aerosol transmission
of viruses, especifically HIV and Ebola, but on the related subject
of insect transmission of viruses. Much work has been done and said
on the possibility of insects transmitting HIV. But most of the work
has concentrated on mosquitoes. But, after initially demonstrating
that this virus does not replicate in mosquitoes (or in other
insects), the only possibility of transmission would have to be
mechanical, that is, by contaminated mouthparts. However, mosquitoes
are one of the poorest candidates for this type of transmission, for
their mouthparts are small, slender and "clean" (few features to
harbor blood components and their corresponding pathogens. But more
important yet, is the fact that mosquitoes are "successful biters",
with a very low rate of interrupted feeding.
In the last message on this subject (5), the demonstrated capability
of horse flies (and other tabanids) in mechanically transmitting the
equine infectious anemia virus (IEAV) was discussed, but tabanids as
vectors of HIV would also appear to be poor candidates for HIV
transmission because of the low incidence of feeding on humans. We
have conducted some research with stable flies, Stomoxys calcitrans,
in urban areas and have studied their numbers, breeding habitats,
and hosts in urban areas. We have determined that they breed in great
numbers in backyard composts (especially grass clippings) and their
numbers appear to be increasing in urban areas (people are doing
more backyard composting because of the banning of yard wastes from
sanitary landfills). We also found out that in the Kansan cities of
Manhattan (ca. 50,000 hab.), Topeka (ca. 200,000 hab.), and Kansas
City, ca. 49, 48, 20, and 10 of the trapped flies in which the hosts
of the blood could be identified (by ELISA), had fed on dogs,
cattle, pigs, and horses, respect. But, it was most interesting to
discover that ca. 10% had also fed on humans. These percentages add
to more than 100% because ca. 29 and 5% had 2 and 3 host blood.
Considering that stable flies feed mainly once a day, this indicates
a high rate of interrupted feeding. Mouthparts of stable flies are
large (over 200 um in the open position), of a complex morphology,
and produce a painful bite. We did not determine whether a fly with a
given blood type had fed on another host of the same species (which
would increase the level of interrupted feeding rate). Who are the
human hosts remains unclear. A 1991 publication from Germany
suggested that when stable flies are interrupted in their feeding,
the first thing they do at a new host is to regurgitate part of the
previous meal, thus increasing the potential for mechanical
transmission. The authors called this, "regurgitative transmission".
We are currently preparing the manuscript describing this work, but
we have not found many references on studies considering this fly as
vector of human diseases (except polio). Any references on this topic
would be appreciated.
