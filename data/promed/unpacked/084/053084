[Re: ProMED-mail Hepatitis E, foodborne - UK: (England) 20101023.3849]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The recent reports from Cornwall remind us that autochthonous cases of
hepatitis E are increasingly encountered in Europe. In fact, reporting
rates in England and Wales are somewhat higher than those of other
regional countries (see graph at
<http://www.gideononline.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/Hepatitis-E-Europe.png>).

The following background data on hepatitis E in the United Kingdom are
abstracted from the Gideon e-book series.(1,2). Primary references are
available on request.

- Only one autochthonous case (in 1999) of hepatitis E was reported
during the period from 1994 to 2000, all others were either imported
or source unknown.
- 10 autochthonous cases had been reported as of 2006.
- 186 cases were reported during 1996 to 2003, including 17
autochthonous cases.
- 100 confirmed and presumed indigenous infections were reported in
2005 (30.4 percent of total cases, 70 percent above age 55 years).
- 181 cases were confirmed during January to June 2005, including 25
autochthonous cases.
- 21 autochthonous cases were documented in southwestern England
during a 7-year period (2007 publication); 28 in Cornwall and Devon
during 2005 to 2006.
- A series of 24 cases of non-travel associated hepatitis E infection
was treated at a hospital in south Wales during a 25-month period
(2010 publication).
- 13 cases were confirmed in South Hampshire during a 13-month period
(2005 to 2006).

Prevalence surveys
------------------
- 5 percent to 35 percent of pigs on farms in the Yorkshire Humberside
area (2008 publication)

Seroprevalence surveys
----------------------
- 16 percent of blood donors, 13 percent of patients with chronic
liver disease, and 25 percent in individuals over 60 years
(southwestern England, 2008 publication)
- 13 percent of persons in England (1991 to 2004)
- 3.9 percent (native-born) to 8.8 percent (foreign-born) of persons
in inner city London (1996 publication)
- 2.4 percent of farming industry workers (2009 publication).

Human infection by a porcine strain of hepatitis E virus has been documented.

Notable outbreaks
-----------------
2008 - an outbreak (33 cases) was reported among passengers on a
British round-the-world cruise ship.

[ProMED-mail thanks Professor Berger for providing these collated data
and for the information illustrating that reporting rates for
hepatitis E virus infection in the UK (England and Wales) are higher
than in other parts of Europe. Primary references are available from

You might want to include the following reference which I find quite
convincing!

Colson P, Borentain P, Queyriaux B, Kaba M, et al: Pig liver sausage
as a source of hepatitis E virus transmission to humans. J Infect Dis.
2010 Sep 15; 202(6): 825-34
<http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/655898>

Background
----------
The source and route of autochthonous hepatitis E virus (HEV)
infections are not clearly established in industrialized countries
despite evidence that it is a zoonosis in pigs. We investigated the
role of figatellu, a traditional pig liver sausage widely eaten in
France and commonly consumed raw, as a source of HEV infection.

Methods
-------
A case-control study was conducted of 3 patients who presented
autochthonous hepatitis E and 15 members of their 3 different
families. Anti-HEV immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M antibody
testing was performed with commercial assays. HEV RNA was detected in
serum samples of patients and in pig liver sausages by means of
real-time polymerase chain reaction and sequenced by means of in-house
sequencing assays. Genetic links between HEV sequences were analyzed.

Results
-------
Acute or recent HEV infection, defined by detection of anti-HEV
immunoglobulin M antibodies and/or HEV RNA, was observed in 7 of 13
individuals who ate raw figatellu and 0 of 5 individuals who did not
eat raw figatellu (P = .041). Moreover, HEV RNA of genotype 3 was
recovered from 7 of 12 figatelli purchased in supermarkets, and
statistically significant genetic links were found between these
sequences and those recovered from patients who ate raw figatellu.

Conclusion
----------
Our findings strongly support the hypothesis of HEV infection through
ingestion of raw figatellu.
