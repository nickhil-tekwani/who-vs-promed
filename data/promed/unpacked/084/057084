NEWCASTLE DISEASE, WILD PIGEONS - ARGENTINA

Emergency report:
Translation of an e-mail received on 2 September 1999 from Dr Luis Osvaldo
Barcos, President of the National Service of Agrifood Health and Quality
(SENASA), Ministry of Economy, Public Works and Services, Buenos Aires:
Report date: 2 September 1999.
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 8 June 1999.
Outbreaks:
Location: El Tigre, province of Buenos Aires
No. of outbreaks: 1
Description of affected population: three wild pigeons in an urban habitat
were found dead on the terrace of a private house in Puerto de Frutos in
the area of El Tigre, province of Buenos Aires. In the same location
another six pigeons with mild clinical signs of disease were killed.
Total number of animals in the outbreak:
susceptible: ---
cases: 9
deaths: 3
destroyed: 6
slaughtered: 0
Diagnosis: all of the analyses were completed by the end of August 1999.
A. Diagnostic tests carried out:
- Post-mortem data: congestive lesions in the brain. No Newcastle disease
lesions were observed in other organs. The spleen, liver, lungs and brain
were removed.
- Virus isolation: samples from organs obtained at post mortem were
inoculated into embryonated SPF(1) chicken eggs. The virus was isolated
following the fourth passage through chicken embryos (the isolation
required several passages in order to achieve adaptation to the species).
B. Characterisation of the strain: a sample of allantoic fluid was sent to
the INTA(2) to be typed using the PCR(3) technique. Another sample of the
fluid was used to carry out the ICPI(4) test at the Central Laboratory.
- IPIC test: 1.26 (corresponding to a mesogenic strain).
- outcome of the PCR technique: this was a pathogenic strain of the
Newcastle disease virus (this technique cannot differentiate a mesogenic
from a velogenic strain).
Epidemiology / Measures implemented: the area of El Tigre is urban and
semi-urban, with no commercial poultry farms. On the day of the discovery,
and during the following 21 days, the area was carefully searched,
especially around Puerto de Frutos, but no other dead birds were found, nor
birds with clinical signs of the disease. The people living or working in
the area were apprised of the situation and of the need to report any new
episode to SENASA.
Argentina maintains its status as free from Newcastle disease due to
velogenic strains of the virus, as notified to the OIE in June 1997 (see
Disease Information, 10 [35], 117, of 29 August 1997). The present report
contributes to reporting the presence of viral activity in wild birds, such
as pigeons living in an urban habitat.
(1) SPF: specific pathogen free
(2) INTA: Instituto Nacional de Tecnolog√≠a Agropecuaria (National Institute
for Agricultural and Livestock Technologies)
(3) PCR: polymerase chain reaction
(4) ICPI: intracerebral pathogenicity index
