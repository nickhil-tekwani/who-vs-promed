Cyprus's agriculture minister said on Monday [5 Nov 2007] that a European
Union expert had confirmed an outbreak of foot and mouth disease [FMD] at 2
farms on the Mediterranean island.

Final results were not expected from a European Union lab in Britain until
later on Monday [5 Nov 2007], but a Dutch veterinary expert confirmed the
authorities' worst fears, Agriculture minister Photis Photiou told Reuters.

"The EU expert who arrived visited the 2 farms this morning and has
confirmed there is an outbreak," Photiou said. "This is a very bad
situation. We are a very small country and all farms are next to each
other. It will be a big disaster for these people (farmers)," he said.

Authorities on Monday morning [5 Nov 2007] culled up to 300 goats and sheep
from the 2 farms in the southern district of Larnaca, a farming intensive
area dotted with pig and cattle farms. If necessary authorities would
extend the cull, Photiou said. "We have already killed 300 animals, but we
don't know how far we have to go." A foot and mouth outbreak will
inevitably lead to restrictions on Cyprus's meat exports.

Cyprus has not experienced an outbreak of foot and mouth, which is
devastating to livestock, since 1963. The disease is usually harmless to
humans, but extremely dangerous to many animals, including cows, pigs, and
sheep, which develop blisters on their hooves, foam at the mouth, and
collapse. The virus is highly contagious and spreads easily with the wind.

Local reports have suggested that anything between 100 000 and 160 000
animals were at risk. Around 15 000 animals were in the risk zone of 3 km
(2 mi) around the 2 farms, and 150 000 in a broader 10 km (6 mi) zone,
Photiou said.

Agriculture, including farming, represents about 2.8 per cent of Cyprus's
gross domestic product. The island is generally self-sufficient in its meat
and dairy products and exports pork.

Authorities were puzzled at an apparent false alarm in late October [2007],
when tests on another flock of sheep showing suspect symptoms came up
positive, but EU test results were negative.

Vets maintained quarantine over the 1st suspect farm because of the
discrepancy, and extended it after a flock at a 2nd farm 500 meters (0.3
mi) away showed symptoms late last week.

"Nobody knows how it reached Cyprus. There are a lot of scenarios, a lot of
suspicion, but we cannot know," Photiou told reporters earlier.
