Summary of new viruses this week
Afghanistan: 1 new case of wild poliovirus (WPV1)
Pakistan: 1 new case of WPV1
Papua New Guinea: 3 new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1)
Somalia: 2 new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2)
- Afghanistan and Pakistan continue to detect WPV1 through environmental sampling, indicating sustained transmission

Afghanistan
- 1 new case of WPV1 in Shahid-e-Hassas district, Uruzgan province. The case had onset of paralysis on [8 Jul 2018].
- This brings the total number of WPV1 cases in 2018 (in Afghanistan) to 13.

Pakistan
- 1 new case of WPV1 in Sarki Tetara district [Sarki Tetara is a Union Council in Charsada district], Charsada province [Charsada is a district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province]. The case had onset of paralysis on [1 Aug 2018].
- This brings the total number of WPV1 cases in 2018 (in Pakistan) to 4.
- WPV1 has been isolated from one environmental sample collected in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Peshawar district, on [27 Aug 2018].

Nigeria
- No new cases of cVDPV2 were reported this week [week of 11 Sep 2018]. The total number of cVDPV2 cases reported in Nigeria in 2018 is 8.
- The latest cases, from Miga local government area (LGA), Jigawa state, and Baure LGA, Katsina state, had onset of paralysis on [27 Jul 2018].
- No new cases of WPV1 were reported. The most recently detected WPV1 case, from Borno state, had onset of paralysis on [21 Aug 2016].
- The country continues to be affected by 2 separate cVDPV2 outbreaks, the 1st centered in Jigawa state and the 2nd in Sokoto state.
- In response to cVDPV2 detection, the country continues to conduct acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance-strengthening activities including enhanced active surveillance visits and community sampling. The programme has also carried out an extensive search for type 2-containing vaccines (tOPV/mOPV2) in the areas surrounding where the virus is detected.
- The GPEI is working with regional and country counterparts and partners to support an outbreak response and plan the October [2018] sub-national immunization activity.
- At the same time, outbreak response to WPV1 continues, including efforts to address surveillance and immunity gaps in parts of Borno state.

Lake Chad Basin
- The detection of WPV1 and cVDPV2 in Nigeria continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad Basin.
- Emergency outbreak-response efforts continue across the Lake Chad Basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps in the region.
- These include efforts to vaccinate children at markets, in internally displaced persons and refugee camps, and at international borders.
- Preparations continue for a cross-border synchronized immunization activity in October.

Central Africa
- No new cases of cVDPV2 were reported this week [week of 11 Sep 2018] in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The total number of cases detected in the country in 2018 is 13.
- The most recent case, from Yamaluka district, Mongala province, had onset of paralysis on [22 Jul 2018].
- DRC is affected by 3 separate strains of cVDPV2, in the provinces of Mongola, Maniema, and Haut Lomami/Tanganika/Haut Katanga/Ituri.
- In response to recent geographic spread of one of the strains, including to Ituri province close to the border with Uganda, provincial governors on [26 Jul 2018] convened an urgent meeting and signed the "Kinshasa Declaration for Polio Eradication." The high-level meeting was convened by HE the minister of health, as well as the WHO director-general and the regional director for Africa. Provincial governors committed to providing the necessary oversight, accountability, and resources needed to urgently improve the quality of the outbreak response being implemented across the country. Outbreak response since cVDPV was 1st confirmed in 2017 has been marred by operational challenges, as too many children continue to remain un- or under-vaccinated. This level of oversight can help ensure that operational deficits are rapidly identified and addressed.
- The polio outbreak response is being conducted simultaneously with an ongoing Ebola outbreak affecting North Kivu province, in the east of the country (close to provinces affected by cVDPV2). As in the past, the polio teams are coordinating closely with the broader humanitarian emergency network to ensure both outbreaks are addressed in a coordinated manner (as was the case during the recent Ebola outbreak in Equateur province, which was successfully stopped).
- Partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative will continue to support authorities across the country to ensure that this new level of commitment rapidly translates into operational improvements on the ground.

Horn of Africa
- The Horn of Africa is currently affected by separate outbreaks of cVDPV2 and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 3 (cVDPV3), reporting both cases and environmental positives.
- 2 new cases of cVDPV2 were reported this week, both in Kismayo district, Lower Juba province, with onset of paralysis on [29 and 30 Jul 2018], respectively.
- Somalia has reported a total of 7 cases in 2018: 4 cVDPV2, 2 cVDPV3, and 1 cVDPV type 2 and 3.
- cVDPV2 was also detected in one environmental sample collected on [2 Aug 2018] in Waberi district, Banadir region.
- cVDPV2 has also been detected during 2018 in one environmental sample in Kenya.
- Outbreak response to both virus types is currently being implemented in line with internationally agreed-upon guidelines. Large-scale supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) have been implemented in Banadir, Lower Shabelle, and Middle Shabelle regions, Somalia, with additional SIAs planned or carried out in the affected zones of the Horn of Africa. Special surveillance activities are being undertaken to determine the origin of the viral circulation.
- WHO and partners continue to support local public-health authorities across the Horn of Africa in conducting field investigations and risk assessments.

Papua New Guinea
- 3 new cases of cVDPV1 were reported this week [week of 11 Sep 2018]: 2 from Eastern Highlands province, in Henganofi district (date of onset [24 Jul 2018]), in Kainantu district (date of onset [27 Jul 2018]), and one from the National capital district (date of onset [2 Aug 2018]).
- The total number of cases in the country in 2018 is now 12 (4 from Eastern Highland, 2 from Enga, 2 from Madang, one from National capital district, and 3 from Morobe provinces).
- Papua New Guinea officially launched its outbreak response campaign on [16 Jul 2018] in Morobe, Madang, and Eastern Highlands provinces. Round 2 of the outbreak response commenced [20 Aug 2018] in Madang, Morobe, and Eastern Highlands provinces, while vaccination activities in Chimbu, Enga, Hela, Jiwaka, Southern Highlands, and Western Highlands provinces began on [27 Aug 2018]. Nationwide campaigns are planned for October/November [2018].
- The geographic extent of the outbreak response is currently being reviewed and will be expanded as necessary.
- Intensified surveillance measures to improve detection of acute flaccid paralysis and poliovirus are being implemented across the country, with on-the-ground training for provincial and district staff being provided by NDOH and WHO.

[From the above weekly report, unfortunately the transmission of WPV1 in Pakistan and Afghanistan continue as seen by the confirmation of new cases of polio associated with WPV1 infection in the past week. Likewise, unfortunately the transmission of cVDPVs (types 1, 2, and perhaps 3) continues with newly confirmed cases reported in Papua New Guinea and Somalia during the past week. The good news is the absence of newly confirmed cases reported in the DRC and Nigeria, but given the insecurities in the affected zones of both these countries, delayed reporting would not be unexpected.

I highly recommend readers continue on to part [2] of this post for an excellent commentary from Prof. Dr. T Jacob John related to the cVDPV1 outbreak ongoing in Papua New Guinea.

Subject: PRO/EDR> Poliomyelitis update (41): Papua New Guinea 20180912.6025528
------------
Outbreaks of cVDPV1 have been extremely rare: in 2000, there was one in Hispaniola Island; in 2005, there was one in Madura Island in Indonesia; and now [there is an outbreak] in PNG. You have rightly pointed out that the risk factors are low type 1 population immunity due to insufficient b-OPV [bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine] coverage and the continued exposure to Sabin [OPV] type 1 virus in the bOPV. Why large islands are vulnerable remains a mystery.

I wish to speculate: the very wide circulation of cVDPV1 in PNG, with cases in Morobe (3), East Highlands (2), Enga (2), Madang (2), and National capital district (1) suggests contagious spread of the virus and not merely faecal-oral. Perhaps one of the reasons why Sabin 1 becomes cVDPV1 may be its rare ability to spread by person-to-person contact rather than ingestion as for vaccine inoculation. We know that wild polioviruses are highly contagious.

One case of polio with wild type 1 poliovirus occurs in 160-200 infected susceptible children; cVDPV1 has far lower neurovirulence, and a case may occur in 1600-2000 (or more) infected susceptible children. Thus, we can imagine the magnitude of the outbreak in terms of children infected. If only non-immune (hence, susceptible) children were to spread the virus, this magnitude of outbreak is difficult to imagine; thus, immune individuals -- including adults -- may also be participating in transmission. This is a known phenomenon.

The outbreak will soon cease, due mainly to widespread immunity provided by the cVDPV1 outbreak itself saturating the susceptible population, topped up by bOPV or mOPV1 [monovalent OPV1] campaigns. Eventually the world will have to discontinue all OPVs and use only the non-infectious inactivated polio vaccine in order to secure a totally polio-free world.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Prof. Dr. T Jacob John for this excellent discussion regarding the cVDPV1 outbreak ongoing in Papua New Guinea.

I'd like to add that if one looks at the WHO / GPEI data for cVDPV confirmed cases, since 2000, there have been a total of 115 cases of polio associated with cVDPV1, 819 cases of polio associated with cVDPV2, and 15 cases of polio associated with cVDPV3 (http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/this-week/circulating-vaccine-derived-poliovirus/). Additional outbreaks of cVDPV1 were reported from Laos in 2015-2016 and in Madagascar in 2014-2015.

Prof. Dr. T Jacob John's last sentence summarizes the situation beautifully: "Eventually the world will have to discontinue all OPVs and use only the non-infectious inactivated polio vaccine in order to secure a totally polio-free world." - Mod.MPP]
