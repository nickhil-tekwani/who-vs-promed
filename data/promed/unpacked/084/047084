A boy died from rabies in the Saryagashsky district in the Southern
Kazakhstan region, said the News agency with reference to press
service of Extreme Situation Ministry.

According to the press-service, information about the 12-year old
boy, who is dead from rabies, came from department of State sanitary
- epidemiological supervision at 17.55 on 23 Nov 2007. As it was
informed earlier, the child have been hospitalized in the infectious
hospital on November, 17 with suspicion of rabies. In the same day
this diagnosis was confirmed by consultation of physicians.

[The dead boy contracted rabies from a vagrant dog. It is an example
of the timely need for medical aid after bite of animal. The boy was
12 years old. It is known, that children exactly in this age category
most frequently contract rabies in connection with more frequent
contact with the source of infection. Since the beginning of 2007 it
is already 5th case of death from rabies in the Southern Kazakhstan
region. - Corr.BA]

Rabies has become more frequent in Zaporojye
--------------------------------------------------
Animal rabies has become more frequent in Zaporojye oblast. 175 cases
have been registered in this year vs. 78 cases during the last year.
Last week 17 groups of rangers and veterinarians went through wild
animal paths and put 15 doses of vaccine loaded baits in every sq.
meter. Every vaccine unit costs 1 euro and the oblast purchased 18
000 of them. We believe that the vaccination will help, the vets say,
as after the outbreak of rabies in Melitopolskiy region in 2005, when
wolf attacks were registered, the vaccination campaign helped to
reduce the risk and all the year of 2006 was comparably safe.[See
commentary].

This year, 62 people suffered from attacks of animals and 2500 people
received vaccination. The attacking animals were mainly dogs, however
some extraordinary cases happened, like the attack of a fox on
12-year-old girl in the doorway of the 5-floor house building, the
place where the fox could be expected the least. It is already
commonly accepted here that wandering animals are "the integral part
of the city infrastructure". People observe that the numbers of
homeless animals grow in geometrical progression, and most
importantly hungry animals gather in groups terrifying single
pedestrians. The control measure for this phenomenon in the region
was "old fashioned" [i.e., shooting]. Later the more "humane"
measures to kill appeared after the President's order, which is via
injection. Some time later this measure also was abandoned and the
problem was
not attended. Recently some called for return of "old fashioned"
control measures; however, a decision has not been taken yet. The
surveillance data does not support that the risk of rabies is more
from wandering animals. During the last 10 months 431 animals bites
have been registered and 113 children suffered. Pets have bitten 8
times more than homeless animals. The post-exposure vaccination was
offered to 54 people and 2 of them refused it. Most people think that
the fighting dogs are especially dangerous for bites, however they
account only for 2% of attacks and the majority of biters are
pekinese and poodle dogs, which are considered harmless.

[3] Human, animals - Russia (Kursk region)

Cases of rabies have been revealed in the Kursk region
-----------------------------------------------------
In the Kursk region [oblast] a local inhabitant with hydrophobia
signs has admitted to Timsky regional hospital. In July of this year
the man has been bitten by stray dog but he did not seek medical
care. The patient has died the next day after admission. In the
course of epidemiological investigation it was found out that one
more inhabitant of Timsky region has suffered from the same animal,
but she has passed a course of [post exposure] vaccination so that
the woman remained healthy.

Rabies among people were not registered for more than 4 years. In
spite of the fact that in Kursk region killing of vagrant animals
continued, basically red foxes, a situation with rabies remains
complicated. Quantity of sick animals has increased in 7.5 times in
comparison with last year.

Epidemiologists once again remind that rabies is fatal disease, and
vaccination [of exposed people] is the most effective way to protect
from this infection.

Vaccination should be started not later than in 3 days after contact
with sick animal.

[The most effective way, currently known to reduce and even eliminate
sylvatic rabies, and consequently rabies in domestic animals
resulting in exposure of humans, is oral rabies vaccination (ORV) of
wildlife. This method, performed by the controlled, periodic,
well-planned dispersion of baits with vaccine allowing identification
of the immunised animals, has been successfully applied, since the
early 80s, for vaccination of the red fox in western Europe, later of
racoons and foxes in North America and since 1998 also of jackals and
foxes in the Middle East (Israel). See WHO's review "Recombinant
vaccines for oral immunization of wildlife" at
<http://www.who.int/rabies/vaccines/recombinant/en/index.html>.

It is encouraging to note that the application of ORV has now been
attempted in a heavily-infected territory in Ukraine [item 2].
However, such application will deliver the expected results only if
carried out according to a long-term, well planned programme which
will include the dispersion of the baits (by foot, as the Ukrainians
tried, or from the air). The baits should be suitable to the targeted
species, dispersed in a timely and orderly manner and not
erratically. - Mod.AS].
