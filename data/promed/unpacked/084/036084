You cannot say anything with perfect confidence so it's not helpful or
even relevent to make such a statement. In short it's meaningless.
One can say that no avian species has a documented TSE, or has ever
succumbed to massive intracranial innoculation of BSE prion.
One can say that in neither laboratory tests nor a massive feeding of
heavily infected material countrywide did pigs succumb to BSE.

It would be cheaper, if you really want to know, to:
1) Restrict culling to a generously funded cohort cull.
2) Offer farmers a $100,000 reward for each case found.

See above.

A complete ban might well have environmental problems that ought also to
be considered. The disposal of a few million tonnes/yr of animal parts
is most efficiently and most ecologically done via consumed MBM. One
should also remember that feeding animal remains to pigs is a system
that has been in use for millennia as pigswill.
