Viet Nam: Another Human Case of Avian Influenza in Thai Binh Province
---------------------------------------------------------------------
A 36-year-old man from a northern province is battling for his life in a
Hanoi hospital after contracting the [H5N1] strain of avian influenza virus
that has been affecting Viet Nam since last year [2004]. The Director of the
Department of Preventive Medicine and AIDS Prevention Trinh Quan Huan said a
man from the Vu Van Commune in the Vu Thu District was treated at the
Infection Faculty at Thai Binh Province General Hospital before being tested
for the virus at the Bach Mai Hospital, Institute of Clinical Research for
Tropical Diseases in Hanoi last Friday [25 Feb 2005].
Doctors treating the man, who is in critical condition, have said
that he contracted bird flu after coming into contact with infected
poultry. He is the 5th person to contract the virus in Thai Binh
Province so far in 2005.
On Sat 26 Feb 2005, the Animal Health Department, under the Ministry
of Agriculture and Rural Development, reported that 14 out of 35
previously affected provinces and cities have not reported any new
outbreaks of the disease in the last 3 weeks. These localities
include Kien Giang, Ninh Thuan, Dong Nai, Tien Giang, HCM City in the
south, Quang Binh, Nghe An in the centre, Lam Dong in the Central
Highlands, Ninh Binh, Ha Nam, Thai Nguyen, Phu Tho, Thai Binh and
Hanoi in the north. However, on Fri 25 Feb 2005, 11 new infection
hotspots were detected at poultry farms in 9 communes of 8 districts
of the Cuu Long (Mekong) Delta provinces of Bac Lieu, Long An, Dong
Thap, Ben Tre and Tra Vinh.
As of last Saturday [26 Feb 2005] 6000 ducks and geese have been
culled in the communes as part of an eradication programme.

Viet Nam: Another Human Case of Avian Influenza Virus Infection in the North
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A 35-year-old poultry market cleaner in northern Viet Nam has
contracted avian influenza, which has killed 47 [42 as of 2 Feb 2005,
according to WHO] people in Asia, the Lao Dong newspaper reported on
Tue 1 Mar 2005
It said the woman was taken to hospital on Thu 24 Feb 2005, and tests
confirmed on Mon 28 Feb 2005 that she had contracted avian influenza
virus, which experts fear could mutate into a form that could pass
between people and unleash a global influenza pandemic that might
wipe out millions.
The woman, from a Hanoi district, is the latest bird flu patient
detected in northern Viet Nam, where fewer outbreaks have been
reported in recent weeks, but where the cool spring weather still
favours the spread of the H5N1 virus.
Officials said the virus killed a 69-year-old man last week and
infected another 2, all of them in the northern province of Thai
Binh, 110 km (70 miles) southeast of Hanoi and far from the southern
Mekong Delta where the outbreaks began in December. The 2 patients
have been treated in the same Hanoi hospital to which the latest
victim was taken.
Doctors there declined comment on their conditions, but state media
said one of the 2 from Thai Binh [province], a 21-year-old man, was
in critical condition and on a respirator after drinking duck blood
before the Lunar New Year festival last month. His 14-year-old
sister, suspected of having bird flu, is also being treated at the
Hanoi hospital. [It was reported that the girl had tested negative in
ProMED-mail post "Avian influenza, human - East Asia (38): Viet Nam
20050228.0629" - Mod.CP]
The H5N1 strain has killed 14 people in Viet Nam since December
[2004], taking the total in Asia to 47 since the virus erupted across
large parts of Asia at the end of 2003. Almost all the victims -- 34
Vietnamese, 12 Thais and a Cambodian -- have caught it directly from
poultry.

[It is presumed that the patient referred to above is either the
36-year-old male or the 35-year-old female referred to in parts [1]
and [2], respectively. It is difficult to establish the precise
number of human cases of avian influenza that have been confirmed in
Viet Nam with certainty on account of the practice of identifying
cases by their age. Also the WHO data and the local data are computed
from different start dates. The number of deaths can be established
with more certainty. The WHO cumulative count has not been updated
since 2 Feb 2005, when the number of deaths was given as 42 (29 in
Viet Nam, 12 in Thailand and one in Cambodia)-- see
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/en/. According to the
Vietnamese authorities, the number of fatalities in Cambodia and
Thailand has remained the same at 1 and 12 respectively, whereas the
number of deaths in Viet Nam has risen from 29 to 34, making the
overall total 47 for East Asia as a whole. - Mod.CP]
