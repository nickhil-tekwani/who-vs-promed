HANTAVIRUSES - BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA (6)
======================================
Subject: Re: PROMED-AHEAD-EDR: Hantaviruses - Bosnia-Herzegovina (5)

Dear Karl,
Happy New Year. In response to where the KHF (Hantavirus) studies asre
being done I would suggest they are probably being done by our colleague
Dr. Ana Stankova GLIGIC. Institute of Immunology and Virology, Torlak,
Vojvode Stepe 458, ll000 Belgrade, Yugoslavia.
I'am sure Charlie Calisher will concur in this. Best regards.
Joe Gibbs

- We have knowledge of related Baltic-Hantavirus research being done at
other institutes, for example Tatjana Avsic-Zupanc of Ljubljana, Slovenia.
