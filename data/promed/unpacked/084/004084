A day after 22 spotted deer died at the Kanan Pendari Zoo Park in Chhattisgarh [state], investigations have revealed that the deaths were caused by anthrax bacterial infection.

"Spotted deer died due to anthrax infection. Analysis of symptoms confirms that the animals were infected by bacteria called _Bacillus anthracis_," principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF) Ram Prakash told reporters at the zoo, located about 12 kilometres [about 7.5 miles] away from Bilaspur town.

"The dead herbivorous animals showed symptoms of anthrax bacteria, as blood came out through mouth and anus. The stomach swelled like a balloon because of infection," he pointed out, adding that there were 53 spotted deer, including 18 males and 35 females, in the cage.

He said anthrax is a communicable bacterium that spreads very fast through air. "Hence, we have buried all the dead animals instead of consigning them to flames. One of the apparent reasons for the outbreak of anthrax bacteria is high moisture content in the air due to continuous rainfall in the region. "Even 2 days ago, it rained heavily in Bilaspur region and there is still moisture in the air," he added.

Asked how only female animals died due to infection, Ram Prakash explained that male deer have a better immune system than female deer. However, he said the state forest department was starting a detailed investigation into all aspects of anthrax infection in animals in the zoo.

Stating that a 3-member committee, comprising DFO [divisional forest officer] Bilaspur Hemant Pandey, Achanakmar Tiger Reserve deputy director CL Agrawal and veterinary surgeon PK Chandan, has been constituted to further probe the matter, the PCCF said a team of experts from the Veterinary College at Anjora has also confirmed that the deaths were caused due to anthrax infection.

With this incident, Kanan Pendari zoo will remain closed to the general public for the next 10 days, as a team of doctors have begun vaccination of the animals in the zoo to prevent infection.

As the animals started dying under mysterious circumstances on Wednesday [15 Jan 2014], initially wildlife officials suspected that the herbivorous animals were poisoned by someone.

At least 22 spotted female deer were found dead Wednesday [15 Jan 2014] at the Kanan Pendari Zoo in Chhattisgarh [state]'s Bilaspur district, forest officials said.

Officials have yet to confirm the exact cause of the death but suspect that the deer died of poisoning. Divisional forest officer Hemant Pandey said the cause of death would be known after autopsy, but the sudden deaths shocked the forest department.

Sources said zoo staff spotted the dead deer when they went to feed them. The zoo, which attracts scores of visitors every day, is home to about 53 deer, 18 of them male.

Forest officials are not ruling out the possibility of poaching behind the deaths. Some of the deer were pregnant.

[A telling comment in the previous day's report: "zoo staff spotted the dead deer when they went to feed them." Unless this zoo has had previous outbreaks in this pen before, it is most likely that they were fed contaminated feed. Why 22/35 does were affected and none of the 18 males is hard to explain. As the does were pregnant, it may be that the sexes were running separately in the pen and the does were fed from one (contaminated) feed sack and the bucks from another (uncontaminated) feed sack. That so many died over what seems to have been a very short period, probably overnight, as penned animals are regularly checked both by staff and zoo visitors, would reinforce the probability of a contaminated source mimicking a poisoning.

OIE has a report of bovine anthrax outbreaks in Chhattisgarh state in 2005 (1 outbreak, 3 cases), in 2006 (2 outbreaks, cattle and sheep and/or goats affected), in 2009 (1 outbreak, 22 cattle affected), and in 2012 (2 outbreaks, 38 cattle affected). Chhattisgarh is an inland state on the western border of Orissa, a state with plenty of anthrax outbreaks; see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chhattisgarh. Thus we can assume that locally produced Orissa bone meal has a high probability of inadequate sterilization and thus a risk of initiating anthrax outbreaks.

In spite of what the PCCF Ram Prakash stated, the risk of anthrax spores being spread in the smoke from a carcass burning is trivial. Buried carcasses present a greater long-term risk, as ground water can later carry any surviving spores up to the soil surface. But presented by the urgent need to dispose of 22 does, his preference for digging a hole is understandable. Burning such a number would present problems.

Vaccinating other animals in the zoo exposed to the same feed is certainly wise, as would the laboratory investigation of the deer feed components. Speculation that the feed was contaminated is a preliminary step; confirmation is needed. There is always the risk of spread via biting flies, so every pen should be checked twice a day for any sick animals until it is believed that the risk is over. - Mod.MHJ
