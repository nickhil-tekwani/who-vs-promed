The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the State of
California announced today, 12 Oct 2006, that test results from the field
investigation of the outbreak of _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 [infection
associated with] spinach are positive for _E. coli_ O157:H7. Samples of
cattle feces on one of the implicated ranches tested positive based on
matching genetic fingerprints for the same strain of _E. coli_ that
sickened 199 people.
The trace back investigation has narrowed to 4 implicated fields on 4
ranches. The outbreak strain of _E. coli_ O157:H7 from cattle feces was
identified on 1 of these 4 ranches. At this time, testing of other
environmental samples from all 4 ranches that supplied the implicated lot
of contaminated spinach is in progress.
The positive test result is a significant finding, but is just one aspect
of this investigation. More information may come forward as the
investigation continues. These 4 fields, located in Monterey and San Benito
counties, are not currently being used to grow any fresh produce. While the
focus of this outbreak has narrowed to these 4 fields, the history of _E.
coli_ O157:H7 outbreaks linked to leafy greens indicates an ongoing
problem. As the FDA stated in its letter to the lettuce industry in Nov
2005, FDA continues to be concerned due to the history of outbreaks and the
on-going risk for product contamination of leafy greens
(<http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/prodltr2.html>).
This investigation is ongoing. The FDA, the State of California, the CDC
and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) continue to work
closely to determine the cause and scope of the _E. coli_ O157:H7 outbreak
linked to fresh spinach.

[This quote appeared in the media in regard to the above FDA report: "We do
not have a smoking cow at this point," said Dr Kevin Reilly, deputy
director of the Prevention Services Division of the California Department
of Health Services. Nevertheless, Reilly called the match "an important
finding." - Mod.LL]
