Date: 6 Apr 2003
From: Dick Hamilton <rihamilto@shaw.ca>

Readers have pointed out that I made a serious error in indicating that
citrus huanglongbing had been reported in Northern Territory, Australia.
That report is false.
According to the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service, neither HLB nor
its vector, the Asian citrus psyllid (_Diaphorina citri_), are present in
Australia.
I am indebted to Rob Duthie, Plant Biosecurity, Market Access and
Biosecurity, Agriculture Fisheries and Forestry - Australia and Richard
Davis, Plant Protection Service, Secretariat of the Pacific Community,
Suva, Fiji Islands for notifying me of the error.
I sincerely apologize for my mistake.
