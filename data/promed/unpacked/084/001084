Several sick ravens were spotted by a couple taking a walk in the
Wuhrlochpark (Neuchatel) on Tuesday (13 Dec 2011). Some were already
dead. "It was a death field," says Oliver Nicholas, one of the people
who found the birds. While they were there, even more birds fell down
from the trees. Overall, according to Nicholas, about 10 birds
ended-up on the ground.

The couple collected 5 birds that still had signs of life and brought
them to the veterinarian Mullheimer Elmar Breuer. One bird died on the
way there, and the other 4 remaining were still alive.

The veterinary diagnoses was clear: "The animals had the typical signs
of phosphoric acid poisoning," said Breuer. They were vomiting and had
diarrhea. In addition, the birds suffered from cramps. Three birds
died within a short time in the veterinary practice. A bird was nursed
overnight in the practice and will be released on Wednesday (14 Dec
2011) morning.

Whether the ravens were deliberately poisoned is still an open
question. Veterinarian Elmar Breuer believes that given the season, it
is not an accident, with herbicides or similar compounds. "There were
some individual cases in the past, but I've never experienced so many
together during my nearly 20 years of practice," says the vet.

There was a similar episode like this in the past in Neuchatel about 5
years ago, recalls Norbert Selz, clerk for nature conservation and
environmental protection.

An initial assumption -- that the birds might have been poisoned with
rat bait that had been laid out in the vicinity in mid-September
[2011] by the city government -- was then considered unlikely: The
bait blocks were set in metal boxes, the interior is accessible only
through a small hole. "The investigation [is now led by] our
environmental investigation service," explained Ulrich Brecht,
spokesman for the police headquarters in Freiburg. Two dead birds were
submitted for examination to the Chemical and Veterinary Investigation
Office in Freiburg.

Because of Christmas [holiday], the test results will [only] be ready
in January 2012. A deliberate poisoning would be a violation of the
Animal Welfare Act, which carries a penalty of 3 years imprisonment or
a fine.

[By far, the largest use of phosphoric acid is in the production of
fertilizers. Toxic effects on animals, including humans, comes from
inhalation and affects the respiratory system. The vet might be
referring to rat poisons containing phosphorus. Animals intoxicated
with this kind of poison present a locomotion disorder (staggering),
vomiting, and diarrhea. Symptoms may include pain in the abdomen and
convulsions.
