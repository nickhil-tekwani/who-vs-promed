The Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance of the Nizhny Novgorod Oblast and the Republic of Mari-El website reports that Schmallenberg virus disease has been found in the Nizhny Novgorod Region.

According to the site, 240 serum samples were collected from cattle in the Bogorodsky agricultural district in the Nizhny Novgorod region; 27 of the samples had antibodies to the Schmallenberg virus [SBV].

The study was conducted by FGBU, the Federal Centre for Animal Health [FGI-ARRIAH, Ministry of Agriculture of the Russian Federation], in the city of Vladimir. [This is an OIE Collaborating Centre for the Diagnosis and Control of Animal Diseases in Eastern Europe, Central Asia and Transcaucasia].

[The Nizhny Novgorod oblast (region) is situated some 350-400 km (218-249 mi) east of Moscow; Vladimir, where the diagnostic federal laboratory is located, is about halfway between them.

Earlier, SBV positive cattle were discovered in the town of Ramenskoye, nearly 50 km (31 mi) south east of Moscow (it can be found on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/r/6LHM).

It is not clear if the animals which have been tested and found seropositive for SBV in both locations are local or imported animals. This issue, as well as their breed, age, and reproduction status (pregnant?) are points deserving clarification in view of SBV's characteristic teratogenic potential.

SBV and its international impact, including issues recently raised by CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) countries, is expected to be among the topics on the agenda of OIE's 81st General Session, taking place in Paris from Sun 26 May 2013 to Fri 31 May 2013. - Mod.AS
