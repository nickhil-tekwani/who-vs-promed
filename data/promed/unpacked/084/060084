6 more cases of glanders are reported in Rio Grande do Sul
----------------------------------------------------------
The head of the Department of Agricultural Protection and Animal Health Protection Division (DSA), Marcelo Gocks, said on 23 Sep 2015, Rio Grande do Sul has 2 more confirmed outbreaks of glanders; 5 animals tested positive in a property of Santo Antonio das Missoes, and another in Sao Jorge.

In all, the state now has 9 cases. Over the weekend (19-20 Sep 2015), 2 more cases were confirmed in the municipalities of Alegrete and Uruguaiana, added to the case already recorded in the city of Rolante. According to the Federation of Municipal Associations of Rio Grande do Sul (Famurs), at the weekend the risk of contagion of the disease led at least 118 municipalities to cancel the traditional parades in honor of the Farroupilha Revolution in the state.

[For glanders-free countries, there are recommendations on importing equines. An international veterinary certificate is required attesting that the animals showed no clinical signs of glanders and were kept in an exporting country free of the disease for at least 6 months prior to shipment. See OIE regulations: http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Media_Center/docs/pdf/Disease_cards/GLA-EN.pdf.

How will this affect international competitors in the 2016 Olympic equestrian events in Brazil? - Mod.JW]
