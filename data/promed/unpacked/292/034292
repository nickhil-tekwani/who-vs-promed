----------------------------------------------------------------------
An ad hoc group of the Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food (ACMSF) looked into this matter following an increase in the incidence of bovine botulism in the UK associated primarily with exposure of livestock to poultry (broiler) litter.

Readers interested in this matter are directed to the ACMSF report (2006) which can be found at http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/botulismincattlereport1206.pdf.

The Group assessed the risk to the public from food produced by herds affected by botulism and concluded that for disease associated with toxin types C and D, "there should be no requirement to restrict sales of meat or milk from clinically healthy cattle from farms where there have been clinically suspected cases of botulism in cattle. In addition, there should be no requirement to restrict the slaughter of healthy cattle from herds where cases of confirmed or suspected botulism have occurred."
