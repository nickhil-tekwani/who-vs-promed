----------------------------------------------------------------------
I received additional information that may be of interest to your readers after sending the diagnostic information. The text below incorporates the diagnostic information sent in a previous e-mail.

On behalf of Veterinary Services, APHIS, US Department of Agriculture, I'd like to provide the following additional information on the 12 Jan 2013 posting "Avian influenza (03): USA (NY), H5N1 LPAI, poultry, RFI":

A Muscovy duck from a Brooklyn, NY, Live Bird Market tested positive by rRT-PCR specific for the hemagglutinin H5 gene and negative for the neuraminidase N1 gene of avian influenza virus.

Virus isolation is pending and we do not have an N-type at this time.

The amino acid sequencing at the hemagglutinin protein cleavage site is compatible with North American low pathogenic avian influenza.

The market underwent an immediate sell down, closure, and cleaning and disinfection (C&D). The C&D was completed on 11 Jan 2013.

Tracing and testing of the source flocks is underway.

[We appreciate Dr Levings sharing with us a larger and more accurate accounting of the situation in the New York live bird market. We will be anxiously waiting for the N-type.
