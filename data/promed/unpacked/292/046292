Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 - Nigeria [8 Aug 2018]
--------------------------------------------------------------------
On [5 Jun 2018], a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) outbreak was confirmed in Sokoto state, Nigeria. From [30 Jan 2018] through 23 May 2018, 10 environmental samples collected from 2 collection sites all tested positive for genetically-related VDPV2 viruses. No associated cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) have been detected with this cVDPV2.

Nigeria is also affected by an ongoing separate cVDPV2 outbreak. A cluster of cVDPV2 was detected in Yobe state from a stool sample from an AFP case with onset on [16 Jun 2018], and an environmental sample collected on 31 May 2018. The same cVDPV2 was detected in Gombe state from an environmental sample collected on [9 Apr 2018]. Previously, the same cVDPV2 was detected in Jigawa state from an AFP case with onset of paralysis on [15 Apr 2018] and 6 environmental samples collected from [10 Jan 2018] through 2 May 2018.

Public health response
----------------------
Detailed investigations were conducted within 48 hours of virus detection from the AFP cases and at each of the different environmental surveillance catchment areas. In addition, the detailed investigation included the search of any residual trivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV) and/or monovalent OPV type 2 (mOPV2), a community coverage survey, health facility retrospective case searching and community active case searching for AFP, and stool sampling among healthy children. In May 2018, 2 rounds of an outbreak response with mOPV2 were organized in 54 local government areas in Jigawa, Bauchi, Gombe, and Sokoto states, to address the 2 cVDPV2 outbreaks at the same time. Surveillance enhancement activities as well as routine immunization intensification activities were implemented and are ongoing.

Since September 2016, there has been no detection of either wild poliovirus type 1 or cVDPV2 in Borno state. However, a regional public health emergency across the Lake Chad subregion remains in place, following detection of both strains in 2016. Borno state continues to be affected by inaccessibility in some areas, hampering access for both vaccinations and surveillance.

WHO risk assessment
--------------------
A risk assessment that was carried out prior to the outbreak response concluded that there was a high risk of geographical spread of the 2 outbreak virus strains. The detection of these cVDPV2 strains underscores the importance of maintaining high levels of routine polio vaccination coverage at all levels to minimize the risk and consequences of any poliovirus circulation.

WHO advice
----------
It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for AFP in order to rapidly detect any polio case, implement preventive measures, and undertake rapid response if needed. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.

WHO's International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than 4 weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of OPV or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) between 4 weeks and 12 months prior to departure.

Countries affected by poliovirus transmission are subject to International Health Regulations Temporary Recommendations that request them to report a case of polio as a national public health emergency and consider vaccination of all international travellers. Any country that is currently exporting poliovirus should ensure vaccination of all international travellers before departure.

[Looking at the past 2 years, it appears as though cVDPVs (circulating vaccine derived polioviruses) are becoming more of a problem than the WPVs (wild polioviruses). Reviewing the most recent figures on laboratory confirmed cases of poliomyelitis as of 1 Aug 2018, in both years (2017 and 2018), cVDPV associated cases significantly outnumber WPV1 associated cases:

Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2018: 13
Total number of cVDPV cases in 2018: 21

Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2017: 22
Total number of cVDPV cases in 2017: 96

With the exception of a small WPV associated outbreak in a population unvaccinated for religious reasons, until the USA changed from an OPV exclusive vaccination policy to a combined IPV, OPV vaccination policy, vaccine associated disease was the primary picture of paralytic poliomyelitis in the USA (I'm referring to the 1970s through late 1990s). (Note that in those days we classified cases as vaccine associated cases in recipients, and vaccine associated cases in contacts of recipients -- with virus identification as "vaccine-like virus" and "wild poliovirus" -- pre-genetic testing of the viruses). So, with a switch to IPV for routine immunization worldwide, will that impact on vaccine associated cases (cVDPVs)? Or will there be a vicious cycle between the use of monovalent OPV (mOPV) for outbreak control, and continued suboptimal vaccination levels permitting continued development of cVDPVs? To use a 1960s expression, "that is the 64 000 dollar question".
