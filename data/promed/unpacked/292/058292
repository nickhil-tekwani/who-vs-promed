The Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (Taiwan CDC) has announced 2016's 1st case of botulism in a 66 year old woman who resides in Pingtung County. On 25 Feb 2016, she sought medical attention at a hospital after she developed slurred speech and some muscle weakness. During hospitalization, she subsequently developed difficulty in swallowing, double vision, weakness in limbs and difficulty in breathing. On 9 Mar 2016, botulism was confirmed in the case.

According to the epidemiological investigation, prior to the case's disease onset, the case had consumed canned eel, seaweed sauce and fish floss [fish floss is a variation on pork floss also called rousong, pork sung or yuk sung, which is a dried product with a light and fluffy texture similar to coarse cotton used as a topping for many foods, such as congee, tofu, and savory soy milk https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rousong. - Mod.LL]. A sample of the aforementioned foods has been submitted to the Food and Drug Administration for laboratory testing to determine the source of the case's infection. All of the samples tested negative for _Clostridium botulinum_. Currently, none of the 4 family members residing in the same household and coworkers have developed any symptoms.

Although it could not be confirmed that the source of the case's infection is canned food, spores of _Clostridium botulinum_, the bacterium that causes botulism, are ubiquitous in the environment. The sporulation of the bacterium occurs in an anaerobic environment. Any food product containing _C. botulinum_ spores can transmit the intoxication if the food product is not properly sterilized during the manufacturing and packaging processes. The toxin produced by _C. botulinum_ is sensitive to heat and can be destroyed by heating it at 100 C [212 F] for 10 minutes. Any homemade pickled products or vacuum-packaged food should be boiled for 10 minutes prior to consumption in order to ensure food safety.

Botulism infection can be fatal if left untreated. Taiwan CDC urges all physicians to remain vigilant for suspected cases of botulism. Physicians may consider the diagnosis if a patient displays gastrointestinal symptoms or fatigue accompanied by neurological symptoms and signs related to botulism such as deterioration of sight, dilated pupils, drooping eyelids and/or weakness of the arms and legs. Physicians should report such cases to the health authority immediately to facilitate provision of antitoxin to treat the case and lower the risk of death.

[ProMED-mail thanks Angela Huang for contributing a Chinese language version of the report: (http://www.cdc.gov.tw/pda/Info.aspx?treeid=45da8e73a81d495d&nowtreeid=1bd193ed6dabaee6&tid=BF27AEC5F333CDA1).

If the meal was the source, the canned eel would be the most likely vehicle. In cases of botulism associated with marine life, the likely serotype of botulism involved is type E, and it is particularly noteworthy in the native people of the USA and Canada. The following article is a review of type E: Horowitz BZ. Type E botulism. Clin Toxicol. 2010;48:880-895.

Abstract:
"There are 7 known serotypes of botulism, designated A through G [now 8 - Mod.LL]; almost all human cases of botulism are caused by types A, B, and E. Botulism type E is the predominant serotype causing disease associated with native Arctic foods. In the circumpolar regions of the world, the coastal soils are rich in botulism type E, and consumption of fish and marine animals in these areas are the sources of clusters of botulism. Unlike spores of type A and B, botulism type E can withstand freezing down to 3.5 C [38 F]. Alaskan native fermentation of fish heads, fish eggs, and beaver tail allow proper anaerobic conditions for botulinum toxin to be elaborated from _Clostridium botulinum_. The consumption of whale meat, "muktuk", has also been associated with outbreaks of botulism in Alaska and the Canadian Arctic. Elsewhere in the Arctic regions, type E botulism has been associated with Norwegian "rakfisk" prepared by a process similar to fermented Alaskan foods. Outbreaks in Egypt with the salted gray mullet "faseikh," in Israel and New York linked to salted uneviscerated whitefish "kapchunka", in Iran from eating "ashbal", an uncooked salmon, and in Japan with "izushi", a traditional fermented fish preserved in rice have occurred. Importation of vacuum-packed whitefish from Alaska and Canada has also been associated with sporadic cases of botulism type E in Europe. In March 2010, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released the heptavalent antitoxin (H-BAT) for use in the USA under an Investigational New Drug program as the preferred treatment for foodborne botulism, including type E, which had not been covered by the bivalent antitoxin, the prior approved antitoxin product in the USA."
