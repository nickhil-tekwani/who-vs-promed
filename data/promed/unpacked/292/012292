The health authorities are concerned over the alarming rise in the number of scrub typhus cases -- the mite-borne infectious disease. Sanitation workers are the worst hit. The DMO [District Medical Officer] has decided to convene a meeting with agriculture department and Suchitwa Mission [technical support in waste management in Kerala] to eradicate the rat population and ensure proper waste management. In 2018, around 269 scrub typhus cases and 2 deaths were reported in Thiruvananthapuram [state capital].

In the past 18 days, around 58 confirmed cases were reported in the state. The majority of the cases are from the state capital. According to officials, the Karakulam-Vattiyoorkavu belt is the worst hit in the city limits. According to experts, the number of cases is likely to go up in the coming weeks.

A top official of district medical office said that the situation was alarming as the rodent population was multiplying. Sanitation workers are the worst hit as they are directly exposing themselves to unhygienic surroundings. According to experts, it's impossible to eradicate rodent population as they come back in huge numbers within six weeks post-elimination.

"All sanitation workers should maintain cleanliness at the end of the day. It's one way to keep them safe from mite-bite," said the official. Patients infected with diseases have a high-grade fever with other symptoms of vomiting, respiratory distress and jaundice.

"Lack of waste management is one prime issue and food is available abundantly in the streets. We are planning to convene a meeting with the Suchitwa Mission and the agriculture department soon. The agriculture department is the agency responsible for controlling the rodent population," said the official.

[Thiruvananthapuram, a coastal city located near the tip of the mainland Indian subcontinent, is the capital city of the Indian state of Kerala (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiruvananthapuram). Karakulam is a village located approximately 10 km (6.2 mi) from Thiruvananthapuram (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karakulam) and Vattiyoorkavu is a residential suburb located 4.5 km (2.8 mi) south of Karakulam in the northeastern side of Thiruvananthapuram. A map showing the location of Karakulam and Vattiyoorkavu can be found at https://goo.gl/maps/emTPKtQiRCn.

Scrub typhus is a zoonotic illness caused by rickettsia-like bacterium _Orientia tsutsugamushi_ that is transmitted by chiggers, the larval stage of trombiculid mites, which feed on the skin cells of animals, including humans and rodents. After feeding on their hosts, chiggers drop to the ground and become nymphs, which then mature into adults that feed only on plant materials.

Rodents (rats and mice) are common hosts for trombiculid mites and may serve as reservoirs, although transovarial transmission in mites is the dominant mechanism for maintenance of _O. tsutsugamushi_ (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/9/12/03-0212_article). Humans become infected when they accidentally encroach in an area where the chigger-rodent cycle is occurring, most often areas of low-lying scrub brush or transitional vegetation.

Endemic regions for scrub typhus extend from Japan and eastern Russia southward to Australia and the Indian subcontinent, and westward to Pakistan and Afghanistan (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5687757/).

How the diagnosis of scrub typhus was made in these patients is not stated in the news report above. Scrub typhus presents clinically with chills, fever, headache, muscle pain, and sometimes with a macular or maculopapular rash and eschar at the site of the chigger bite; confirmation requires laboratory testing, usually by indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay, but this will require a 4-fold rise in antibody titer between acute and convalescent specimens. Results from a single acute serum sample are unreliable, as it takes 7-10 days for IgG antibody to be detectable and antibody will be present in a high percentage of healthy people in an endemic region. The Weil-Felix test, an agglutination test for the diagnosis of rickettsial disease, is based on the detection of antibodies to various _Proteus_ species, which contain antigens that cross-react with rickettsial antigens. The Weil-Felix test is unreliable but continues to be used in resource-poor regions (http://www.japi.org/august2006/O-619.pdf). Molecular methods like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are likely not available in endemic regions.

Patients infected were said in the news report above to have high-grade fever, vomiting, respiratory distress, and jaundice, which could also describe another disease, leptospirosis, also spread by rats. Hantavirus infection is an additional rodent-associated disease suspected in Kerala (ProMED-mail post Hantavirus update - Asia: India (KL) susp. 20140131.2247232). - Mod.ML]
