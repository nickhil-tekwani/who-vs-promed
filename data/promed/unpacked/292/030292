CDC study released on dura mater CJD.
Patients who received contaminated grafts during surgery have developed
fatal Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease as long as 16 years later, health officials
said Thursday. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 61 cases
of Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease (CJD) have been linked worldwide to dura mater
grafts manufactured by a German company since 1979. One of 43 graft-related
CJD cases in Japan involved a patient who developed the rapidly progressive
fatal illness 16 years and one month after receiving a dura mater graft,
the agency said. The average among the 43 patients was approximately seven
years.
Dr. Ermias Belay, CDC epidemiologist, said that the maximum latency period
from the time of exposure to the time patients had onset of CJD was 16 years.
The German manufacturer, B. Braun Melsungen AG, began screening donors in
1987 and stopped mixing dura obtained from different cadavers in its
product, called lyodura, Belay said. Their product substitutes for the
membrane covering the brain or spinal cord, but it has not been licensed
for marketing or distribution in the United States.
