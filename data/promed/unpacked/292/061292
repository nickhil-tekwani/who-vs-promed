We had a bobcat with rabies here in Michigan also try and get into a house
in Sault Ste. Marie in the 70's during a small epizootic in the area. The
cat was first seen sitting by the curb of the road in front of the house.
When the children went down the walk to catch the bus to school the cat
just sat there watching. However, when the children's mother went outside
to take a look, the cat charged. She got back inside the house just as the
cat hit the screen door. The father [was able to kill the cat. It was
submitted and found to be positive for rabies. This was during the time
that rabies was moving into southern Ontario from the Hudson bay area.
Bobcats are normally very shy animals.
The case in Vermont is only the second one I am aware of with a story
behind it. It may well be that any aggressive bobcat such as described in
Michigan and Vermont should automatically be considered as a rabies
suspect. Does anyone else have a similar experience to share?

[As bobcats are becoming more common -- we even get them down here in
southern Louisiana -- we should expect to see more rabid bobcat cases
reported. It is only in Stephen King novels that rabid animals look
different. (I do wonder what that Vermont Game officer was expecting to
see?) It is their behaviour that gives them away as possibly rabid. If the
European rabies model is anything to go by, rabid bobcats may be a dead end
host for the virus, if, like the rabid European badger, they both secrete
more virus and anyway leave more dead foxes & raccoons than wounded and
infected contacts. May I repeat John's request for any further information
on this topic. - Mod.MHJ
