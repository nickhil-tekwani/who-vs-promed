The Autonomous City of Ceuta, through its Animal Health area, which
reports to the Health and Trade Council, confirmed last September
[2010] the myxomatosis outbreak observed in wild rabbits in 2
locations, Monte Hacho and Garcia Aldave. The [diagnosis was based
upon the examination of] a sample taken at the end of September
[2010] from a dead animal in Monte Hacho.

The Animal Health [authority] who had already detected dead rabbits
some days ago, recently decided to send a tissue sample (eyelids and
eyes) to the Central Veterinary Laboratory in Algete. Soon
afterwards, the laboratory -- which belongs to the Rural and Maritime
Environment Ministry -- sent the positive results to the Autonomous
City of Ceuta. Since then, the decision about actions to be taken
became the responsibility of the affected autonomous communities. In
this case, it was decided to take no action in view of the
characteristics of the disease, which is reported to be quite common
in rabbits.

Myxomatosis has a high mortality rate in rabbits, but it is harmless
for humans and the reason why, as explained yesterday [1 Nov 2010]
from the Autonomous City, they decided to take no action. "As time
goes by, the disease will disappear, and only the fittest animals
survive and develop immunity against the virus", explained officers
from the Autonomous City Health Administration. However, if there
were a rabbit breeding facility in Ceuta, the consequences might have
been much worse, leading to extensive financial losses.

Transmission of myxomatosis is by mosquito vectors. A mosquito takes
its blood meal from a sick rabbit, picking up the virus and
inoculating it on another animal when the insect is about to take its
next blood meal. The disease develops shortly afterwards. The death
of affected rabbits is can be especially slow and painful, as these
animals become blind and they are not able to feed themselves
properly, starting to lose weight and wasting away.

Even though the disease is not transmitted to humans, it is worth
mentioning that the meat from a sick animal has a bad taste, and the
quantity is significantly reduced. Numerous reports of dead animals
have been received during recent weeks, corresponding to an outbreak
that has been active since last August [2010].

The upcoming winter season may be beneficial, since low temperatures
cause both mosquitoes and the virus to disappear.

[The item above, including its chronology, is somewhat blurred but it
provides a general idea on the potential impact of an outbreak of
myxomatosis, even in an endemic situation.

Myxomatosis, one of the 2 lagomorpha diseases on OIE's list of
reportable diseases (the other one is rabbit hemorrhagic disease), is
regarded endemic in Spain. It is a major disease of the European
rabbit caused by the Myxoma virus, a member of the _Poxviridae_
family. The disease is not zoonotic.

The diagnosis of myxomatosis, regardless of its clinical form,
depends on the isolation and identification of the virus or the
demonstration of its antigens. The presence of a humoral immune
response facilitates a retrospective diagnosis of a mild form of the
disease, and can provide an indication of the prevalence of infection
in a rabbit population. The disease is characterised by gross
myxomatous skin lesions.

Details on the etiological agent, relevant diagnostic techniques and
vaccines can be seen in chapter 2.6.1 of OIE's Manual of Diagnostic
Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals at
<http://www.oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/2008/pdf/2.06.01_MYXO.pdf>.

Modified live virus vaccines prepared from fibroma virus or modified
Myxoma virus strains are available for immunisation of rabbits.
