Total confirmed, probable, and suspect cases and deaths from Ebola virus disease in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone, as of 18 Aug 2014: Cases 2473 Deaths 1350.

Between 17-18 August 2014, a total of 221 new cases of Ebola virus disease [EVD] (laboratory-confirmed, probable, and suspect cases) as well as 106 deaths were reported from Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone.
[clip]

In the current outbreak, the majority of Ebola virus disease cases are a result of human-to-human transmission and failure to apply appropriate infection prevention and control measures in home care, some clinical settings, and in burial rituals. It is important to understand that EVD is not an airborne disease. Individuals may become infected as a result of contact with the bodily fluids (vomit, diarrhoea, sputum, blood, etc.) from persons who are confirmed to have EVD or who have died from EVD.

Companies bringing goods and services to the affected countries are at low risk for exposure to EVD and WHO, under the International Health Regulations, encourages companies and organizations to continue providing these necessary supplies.

Countries around the world continue to engage in active surveillance for cases of EVD. Reports have been received by WHO of suspected cases and systematic verification is underway in a number of countries to confirm whether these are actual EVD cases. Overall, these reports are a positive sign that surveillance is working and countries are stepping up their preparedness to respond. As of today, no cases have been confirmed outside Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, or Sierra Leone...

WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied except in cases where individuals have been confirmed or are suspected of being infected with EVD or where individuals have had contact with cases of EVD. (Contacts do not include properly-protected health-care workers and laboratory staff.) Temporary recommendations from the Emergency Committee with regard to actions to be taken by countries can be found at:

[Table] Confirmed, probable, and suspect cases and deaths from Ebola virus disease in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone, as of 18 Aug 2014: Total Cases 2473 Deaths 1350

The total number of cases is subject to change due to ongoing reclassification, retrospective investigation, and availability of laboratory results. Data reported in the Disease Outbreak News are based on official information reported by Ministries of Health.

The Minister of Health, Prof. Onyebuchi Chukwu, has dismissed reports that there are 5 fresh cases of the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in Lagos. He added that there was no evidence that discharged patients can transmit the disease.

Re-infection confusion
---------------------
A member of the World Health Organisation committee of experts on Ebola Virus Disease in West Africa, Prof. Victor Inem, has said a cured EVD victim could be re-infected with the same virus if fresh contact was made with carriers. He stated this on Wed [20 Aug 2014] at a one-day 'train the trainer' workshop on EVD prevention and control organised by the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital for the medical stakeholders. Speaking on the overview of the EVD Outbreak in West Africa Sub-Region, he said "It is very possible for a cured victim to re-contract the virus when he brings himself closer again with sufferers through sex, their other body fluids, eating of some animals which are reservoirs of the virus or through processes of burning victims."

[This is a misunderstanding. Recovered EVD patients are immune to re-infection. Recovered men may continue to secrete virus in their semen for a few weeks and infect their sex partners, unless they use condoms. - Mod.JW]

[3] Liberia: curfew, violence

Liberian authorities introduced a nationwide curfew on Tue [19 Aug 2014] and put the West Point neighbourhood under quarantine to curb the spread of the disease.

Police in the Liberian capital [Monrovia] fired live rounds and tear gas on Wed [20 Aug 2014] to disperse a stone-throwing crowd trying to break an EVD quarantine imposed on their neighbourhood, as the death toll from the epidemic in West Africa hit 1350. In the sprawling oceanfront West Point neighbourhood of Monrovia, at least 4 people were injured in clashes with security forces, witnesses said. It was unclear whether anyone was wounded by the gunfire, though a Reuters photographer saw a young boy with his leg largely severed just above the ankle. "The soldiers are using live rounds," said army spokesman Dessaline Allison, adding: "The soldiers applied the rules of engagement. They did not fire on peaceful citizens. There will be medical reports if (an injury) was from bullet wounds."

[Were they police or soldiers? - Mod.JW]
