A focus of rabies eliminated in Komi
------------------------------------
A meeting of the Commission for emergency situations was held in Komi [map at
<http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/ai141_folder/141_photos/141_371_komi_map.jpg>]
on 5 Mar 2008, addressing the measures required to control an
outbreak of rabies in several deer breeding farms and prevent
additional cases.

As noted by the Regnum Correspondent, 1200 doses of vaccine were sent
and several organizations were involved in the rabies control
activities.

As a reminder, between 13 - 26 Feb 2008, 46 deer died on 2 farms. The
laboratory tests confirmed rabies. The number of deer in the area as
of 1 Jan 2008 was found to be 8096. They were grazing in pasture land
located 40 km [24.8 miles] north of the village Petrun.

[Extensive outbreaks of rabies in (domestic or wild) ruminant herds
do occasionally occur. Even a single rabid carnivore, such as a fox,
can infect a considerable number of herbivores by bites. In many
cases, the victims get bitten in their muzzles when sniffing at the
intruder or trying to butt it. - Mod.AS]
