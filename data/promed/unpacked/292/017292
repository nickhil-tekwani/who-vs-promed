HPAI H7N3, poultry, additional outbreaks
----------------------------
On 3 Mar 2016, Mexico reported 4 new HPAI H7N3 outbreaks affecting 3 commercial and 1 backyard farm in 2 states: Puebla (n=2) and Jalisco (n=2).

Detected both in the framework of the active and the passive surveillance systems, outbreaks started between 14 Aug 2015 and 15 Feb 2016. Out of a susceptible population of 535 347 animals, 4130 birds were affected; 4110 died and 118 151 were destroyed. One of the farms has a vaccination program in place.

Another 5 positive viral isolates have been detected in farms in Jalisco, all belonging to the same company of an index outbreak (commercial layers farms with 413 086 birds).

HPAI H7N3 in Mexico was last reported between April and May 2015, when 2 commercial flocks in Puebla and Oaxaca and endemic wild birds in Chiapas were found infected.

Since its 1st incursion in Mexico in 2012, HPAI H7N3 detection has been reported yearly in Mexico.

H7N3 viruses have rarely been reported to infect humans but when it dies, it occurs primarily among poultry workers. Cases show mild symptoms characterized by conjunctivitis and possibly mild respiratory illness. 2 human cases were reported in Mexico in 2012.

[Avian influenza viruses are divided by subtypes, based on 2 proteins found in the viruses: a hemagglutinin, or "H" protein, and a neuraminidase, or "N" protein. There are 16 H types and 9 N types yielding a total 144 possible combinations.

The H5 and H7 subtypes are of particular concern, given the ability of these 2 H-types to mutate from low pathogenic to highly pathogenic strains. These 2 H-types have been known to cause serious disease and mortality in domestic poultry (http://www.inspection.gc.ca/animals/terrestrial-animals/diseases/reportable/ai/fact-sheet/eng/1356193731667/1356193918453).

Avian influenza can and does affect people and clearly has been in Mexico for several years. So one would expect them to have a very active surveillance program.
