On 21 Nov 2000 Spain reported its first cases of BSE, in 2 cows, originally
imported from Austria & the Netherlands, respectively. Austria has never
reported
a case of BSE, the Netherlands has reported only 5. The finding is due to
upgrading
of inspection procedures in Spain in preparation for a Europe-wide inspection
program to be introduced on 1 Jan 2001.
