A fish disease which has devastated some trout fisheries in
Montana and Colorado has now been found in a brood-stock pond
near the Auburn fish hatchery, according to the Wyoming Game
and Fish Department.
Whirling disease is caused by a parasite that is especially lethal to
rainbow trout. According to officials the disease was not found in
the hatchery itself, but the pond which has a different water source
than the hatchery. The disease has now been identified in several
Wyoming waterways, but so far has not had a major impact on the
state's fish population. Game and fish officials say they are taking
every precaution to prevent it from spreading, especially to state
hatcheries.
