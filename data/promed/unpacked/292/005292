LEAF SPOT, BANANA - CARIBBEAN REGION: CONTROL EFFORTS

The Prime Ministers of Dominica and St. Vincent and the Grenadines
will join their St. Lucian counterpart for a meeting that will
discuss plans to rescue the Windward Islands' banana industry. The
meeting is important in light of the problems faced by the industry
on the international market.

Agriculture Minister Ezekiel Joseph noted that the St. Lucia
government was moving to end the infighting by various stakeholders,
including the Tropical Quality Fruit Company Limited (TQFC) and the
National Fair Trade Organisation (NFTO), over efforts to control the
leaf spot disease.

Farmers who conduct business with TQFC say they are being denied
treatment to deal with the leaf spot disease. Such treatment is being
overseen by the NFTO. However, NFTO claims that the TQFC has violated
the terms of a signed agreement and has failed to make provisions for
its members to receive the necessary treatment.

Joseph has since called on both parties to end the dispute. "The
industry is far too important to St. Lucia, and, as a ministry, we
will continue to give support to our farmers," Joseph said. He warned
that failure to resolve the matter would result in a loss of income
to both farmers and the country as a whole, since they would not be
able to meet contractual obligations to consumers in Europe.

[In banana crops, the term "leaf spot disease" is most often used to
refer to yellow sigatoka (YS), caused by the fungus _Mycosphaerella
musicola_. However, it is sometimes also used for black sigatoka (BS,
black leaf streak) caused by _M. fijiensis_ as well as a number of
fungal pathogens in other genera causing similar symptoms in
different regions of the world. In areas where more than one leaf
spot pathogen is present, it is often difficult to distinguish
between them under field conditions, and laboratory analysis may be
needed for a clear diagnosis.

Both YS and BS have been reported to cause serious problems in the
Caribbean region. For example, in 2004, a major campaign was
conducted in St. Lucia to combat YS. The report above may refer to
one or both of the sigatoka diseases. Symptoms and epidemiology are
similar for BS and YS. BS is one of the most devastating leaf
diseases of bananas, while YS is considered less serious because
symptoms appear mainly on older leaves and, therefore, less damage is
caused to photosynthetic tissue. Also, there are more cultivars of
banana and plantain with degrees of resistance to YS than to BS. YS
has been replaced by BS in many areas, but YS is more adapted to
cooler temperatures and is often dominant at higher altitudes. (For
more information on BS and YS, see links below).

The pathogens are spread through water, wind, and with plant
material, including suckers, and can cause yield losses of up to 50
percent. Fruit produced on diseased plants can ripen prematurely
during commercial shipment and cause further losses. Disease
management includes frequent applications of fungicides,
phytosanitary measures, and cultural practices. It is most
unfortunate that control efforts in the Caribbean region appear to be hampered.
