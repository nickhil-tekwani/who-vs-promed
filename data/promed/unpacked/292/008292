8 more staff members at Children's Hospital Boston have tested
positive for whooping cough, bringing to 33 the number of workers
infected, city health authorities reported yesterday, 7 Nov 2006.
The outbreak at Children's Hospital is the largest in recent memory
at a Boston healthcare facility, said Dr. Anita Barry, Boston's
director of communicable disease control. With the latest
confirmatory lab results, the Children's outbreak has now eclipsed a
cluster of cases in September 2006 at St. Vincent Hospital in
Worcester [MA], where 30 staff members were diagnosed with the highly
infectious bacterial disease, also known as pertussis.
According to the state Department of Public Health, 15 to 35
healthcare workers statewide come down with the disease during a typical year.
Disease investigators have said they believe whooping cough was
carried into Children's Hospital by a 19-month-old patient. They
continue to investigate whether a 3-year-old girl who has the illness
contracted it at the hospital or before she arrived there.
Barry said the 8 additional cases reported yesterday do not reflect
recent infections. Instead, she said, most of those staff members
began displaying symptoms in mid-October 2006. So far, no hospital
workers or patients have faced life-threatening complications as a
result of the outbreak.
Michelle Davis, a Children's spokeswoman, said the hospital is
continuing to encourage staff members who show any signs of the
disease, which in its earliest phase mimics the common cold, to come
forward. Workers with symptoms are sent home for 5 days and told to
take antibiotics before they can return to their jobs. Yesterday, 138
staff members were still furloughed.
"It's certainly putting pressure on the system, but we're meeting the
needs" of patients, Davis said.

[A confirmative diagnosis of pertussis is not necessarily rapid,
thereby the delay in more cases being reported. This large cluster
underscores, in my mind, the need for consideration of mandatory
acellular pertussis booster immunization of hospital employees,
especially those involved with small children who are not fully
immunized and who are at risk for the complications of infection with
_Bordetella pertussis_. ProMED thanks Brent Barrett for this post. - Mod.LL]
