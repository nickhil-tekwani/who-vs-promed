[After years of relative calm, this epidemic in northeast France is a re-educating experience. Once these districts return to their normal state, it will be necessary to implement a compulsory annual vaccination policy each spring for at least the next 5-6 years. The losses in the early affected herds have been significant, reflecting a slow reaction in each case. As the farmers became more aware, the losses were minimal. A lesson to be shared. - Mod.MHJ
