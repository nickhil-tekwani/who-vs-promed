[1] News report

A North Carolina woman said Monday [18 Mar 2013] she wasn't surprised to learn that her child's father was the Air Force aviation mechanic whose rabies-infected organs were transplanted into other recipients, including a Maryland man who died. [AM], 20, of Trenton, North Carolina, told The Associated Press that she was dubious when the military told her that [WES] died of a stomach virus in September 2011 while training in Florida. But she said military officials assured her that was the cause. "He did a lot of trapping and hunting and stuff," she said. "He did the trapping, and he didn't care what the animal looked like. He just picked it up."

Military and state health officials visited [AM] last week [week of 11 Mar 2013] at her home and told her that [WES] had died of rabies, she said. At some point in his illness, she was told that he suffered food poisoning from fish. But then she was told he died of complications from a stomach virus, including severe dehydration. "I was very suspicious over that," she said. "At first they said it was poison from a fish, and he fished a lot. I knew he knew all types of fish. Then it came back it that it was a stomach virus. I just couldn't believe that." [AM's] mother said she was also suspicious of the cause of death and asked if the family should take any precautions for [their] son. "I accepted it because that was on his death certificate," she said. "But something just didn't set right with me." [AM's] sister said Monday [18 Mar 2013] that her family was told he died from fish poisoning that caused inflammation of the brain, seizures, dehydration and blood pressure [?]. She said she and her parents were surprised when they learned last week that rabies caused her brother's death.

Doctors in Florida didn't test the 20-year-old for rabies before he died. A man who received an infected kidney died. His heart, liver, and other kidney went to recipients in Florida, Georgia, and Illinois. They started getting the vaccine this month [March 2013], and none has had rabies symptoms. Public health officials in 5 states have been assessing the rabies risk for hundreds of people who may have had close contact with [WES]. They say the virus can be spread through the infected person's saliva and mucous membranes, but human-to-human [transmission] is rare.

[WES] went through basic training in Texas before going to Florida to train as aviation mechanic. He visited a clinic at the Pensacola Naval Air Station in August 2011 for abdominal pain and vomiting and was transferred to a civilian hospital 4 days later, a Defense Department spokeswoman said last week [week of 11 Mar 2013]. The organs were offered for transplant by LifeQuest Organ Recovery Services of Gainesville, Florida, said Kathy Giery, the group's director of donor program development. Giery said the hospital's diagnosis at the time of death was that his illness was caused by food poisoning from ciguatera, a toxin sometimes found in large saltwater fish including grouper, red snapper, and sea bass. The Defense Department has said the donor died of severe stomach and intestinal inflammation with complications including dehydration and seizure. The Florida Department of Health has said he died of encephalitis -- a brain inflammation -- of unknown origin.

[Merritt Clifton has provided the following comment in relation to the press report above and the fact that it has been established that the deceased organ donor died as a result of infection by a raccoon-variant rabies virus. - Mod.CP

"Raccoons are the species most commonly trapped for fur in the Carolinas and Florida, and that is also a raccoon rabies-endemic area. Raccoon trappers in the US usually use leghold traps. Usually they find the raccoon alive in the trap. They may kill the raccoon by drowning if near water and confident there are no alligators nearby (drowning is effected by dragging the trap into the water with a pole and then dragging it back out after the raccoon is dead), or by clubbing or shooting. (Drowning preserves the pelt; clubbing or shooting may damage the fur.). If the raccoon is clubbed or shot, the trapper will likely have contact with blood and brain tissue during skinning.

If the raccoon was collected as a roadkill, as indicated by [AM's] remark that, "He didn't care what the animal looked like. He picked it up," the likelihood of having contact with blood and brain tissue would be enhanced.

Trappers sometimes cut up the remains of the animals they catch for use as bait to catch others. Raccoons are not commonly eaten, but some people stew them. Cooking would of course kill the rabies virus, but preparation for cooking would not. Skinning and cutting up remains are both activities in which a trapper may cut himself on the hands. In cold climates trappers usually wear gloves, but in Florida and the Carolinas, most don't."]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
The recent identification of rabies virus in the brain tissue of an organ donor reminds me of the organ donor in Arkansas several years ago who was the source of the rabies virus that killed a number of organ recipients who had been immune suppressed prior to the receipt of the donated organs.

Recent evidence has also revealed that deceased animals of many species whose meat is used in less than developed countries will also contribute the rabies virus into humans, as even cooking the meat may not kill the virus in the meat products consumed by people. [I am unaware of instances of transmission via cooked food. - Mod.LM]

One wonders why "roadkill" and other deceased animal parts ever enter the food consumption chain ...what surprises me more is that a human who dies of an infectious process is ever considered as a suitable non-suspect organ donor.

The simple question emerges ... where was the "guard at the gate" in this recent episode of human tissue contributing rabies virus to unsuspecting recipients?

You have raised a very pertinent question. Organ transplants demand is more than supply -- this is part of the problem. Short time for decisions is another.

But as you have pointed out, we need to expand the safety net. Blood and transplantation safety routinely checks donor for absence of HIV, HBV, HCV chronic infections. For any one with suspected infectious diseases of CNS one must include rabies virus, and whatever else might be relevant -- I can't offhand think of many. Acute encephalitis should alert about West Nile, and other locally prevalent viruses and they should also be included in the system.

I agree better protocol for recipient safety is needed under such circumstances.
