A total of 4 new cases of [a] hantavirus [infection] in Los Santos province have been reported this morning [Tue 16 Oct 2018] by the provincial health authorities. Carlos Munoz, Los Santos Regional Epidemiology Coordinator, signaled that these new cases bring the overall number of reported cases in 2018 to 77.

He detailed that among the ill individuals are 2 children (one and 4 years of age) from Las Tablas. In addition to these 2 cases, there are an 80 year old patient and a 51 year old man from Pocri, Los Santos.

Munoz clarified that fortunately all these Los Santos individuals developed hantavirus fever and not hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome.

According to the district statistics, Tonosi reported 51 cases, Las Tablas 16, Pocri 5, Los Santos and Pedasi 2 cases each (4 total), while Guarare reported just one case and Macaracas continues to report no cases this year [2018].

Tonosi maintains the highest incidence, followed by Las Tablas district although in 2018 Pocri has the 2nd highest incidence rate due to the effect of the size population in this district.

[Although the above report indicates that none of the affected individuals had hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HPS), a 16 Aug 2018 report indicated that a 73-year-old patient who was maintained for more than 2 months in the intensive care unit of the Joaquin Pablo Franco in Las Tablas, died on Wed 15 Aug 2018 after having been infected by bacteria acquired in the hospital. The patient, from the Flores community in Tonosi in Los Santos Province, suffered HPS (see Hantavirus - Americas (50): Panama (LS) 20180817.5972602).

The number of cases of hantavirus infection continues to increase in Los Santos province, with a total of 77 cases in the region as of Tue 16 Oct 2018. Hantavirus infections occur in Los Santos province relatively frequently. The specific situations in which these patients acquired the infection are not mentioned.

There is no indication of which hantavirus is involved in this or in previous cases in Panama. However, as noted in comments in previous posts, Los Santos and adjoining provinces are endemic for Choclo hantavirus. Although no data on this or the previous cases in earlier years include an indication of which hantavirus is responsible, Choclo is the only one of the 3 hantaviruses known to be endemic in Panama that causes HPS (hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome) or hantavirus fever. However, Dr. Jan Clemens recently commented that Seoul hantavirus could also be present in Panama causing human infections. Appropriate laboratory tests would be required to differentiate Choclo and Seoul viruses. No vaccine is available for Choclo virus.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents live in and around agricultural areas and adjacent houses and buildings. They can be persistently infected with the virus and shed it in urine, feces, and saliva, the source of human infections. - Mod.TY
