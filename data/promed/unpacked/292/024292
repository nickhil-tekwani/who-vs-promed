Seven cases of visceral leishmaniasis in Neiva, Colombia
--------------------------------------------------------
The current outbreak of visceral leishmaniasis in Neiva [Huila Department] has focused the attention of world, Latin American, and national health authorities, on the prevention and control of the disease, which changes according to the environmental and social conditions of the resident population.

So far there have been 7 cases of infection in children in districts 8, 9, and 10, with no fatalities. 2 patients are currently receiving medical care at the Hernando Moncaleano University Hospital.

Although visceral leishmaniasis is a sylvatic disease, it adapts easily to urban living conditions, according to Ana Nilce Elkhoury, a Brazilian bacteriologist, coordinator of the World Health Organization (WHO) and Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) Leishmaniasis Program for the Americas, who arrived in the city to provide support in the education of medical and institutional authorities and the community about the disease.

"We are here to learn more about the situation. There is an outbreak of visceral leishmaniasis in Neiva, which is of great concern so, we are going to implement a strategic plan for integrated actions with the community," said the expert.

The main symptoms of the disease are constant high fevers, associated with involvement of the spleen and liver. Pallor is also a warning sign.

Elkhoury said that the priorities of health institutions are to ensure medical treatment of patients, to make the community aware of the disease, and that community leaders work in cooperation with the Ministry of Health.

"We must identify the sick people as early as possible, refer them to a health center, and ensure that they have comprehensive health care. Early detection generates appropriate care. The main concern is to prevent new infections," said Elkhoury.

For the Brazilian doctor, the current outbreak may generate a constant spread of visceral leishmaniasis over 2 years if cases are not properly identified and controlled.

"The fight against this disease, as with dengue, requires very fast control measures. Medium and long term work must be done and the collaboration between the community and local health authorities will achieve the desired goal: that no one dies of visceral leishmaniasis," she said.

The team of international, Colombian, and departmental [Huila] experts analyze the behavior of the vectors present in the area. "The studies conducted so far have not identified the foci, but we are working to identify them," said Elkhoury.

Visceral leishmaniasis is a complex disease. To determine a transmission area it is necessary to identify the circulating parasites and the reservoirs, which in this case are mammals that are natural carriers of the parasites.

The Brazilian expert said leishmaniasis vector control is performed by impregnating walls with special insecticides, which are activated at a later time. However, the effectiveness of control lies in [concentrating on] specific areas of transmission and not over large areas.

"It is a recent illness in the region. The community has to participate in this process to prevent the breeding of vectors. The reservoirs, which are the main focus of reproduction of visceral leishmaniasis, have to be recognized," she said.

There are important factors determining the disease, such as social, environmental, and climatic, so control is complex. "Deforestation is one of the determining factors, but the disease changes according to the environmental conditions of each locality," said the specialist.

The WHO coordinator said dogs carry the leishmania parasites. However, she stressed that mammals do not transmit the disease directly to humans or to other animals. Leishmaniasis transmission requires a vector.

"Today the transmission pattern in Brazil is urban and not rural and its control is much more difficult. In Neiva (Colombia) the population density is high and there are a considerable number of animal reservoirs of the parasite. The vectors have to be eradicated very well. It [the disease] is recent but has the ability to adapt to areas of low or abundant vegetation," she said.

Nancy Sarabia, coordinator of the International Centre for Disease Investigation (Cidein), said the situation in Neiva is becoming clearer and that the joint work of health workers, communities, and institutions will allow the situation to be handled properly.

"Dr Ana Nilce Elkhoury's experience is critical because there is visceral leishmaniasis in Brazil; it is a disease with which they live. But it is sporadic in Neiva and its appearance surprising, so preparation is essential and will allow for the evaluation of the results of its prevention," she said.

Sarabia also suggested joining forces with other affected departments in Colombia -- Bolivar, the Pacific Coast, and Tolima--, to help control the disease.

"The involvement of the National Institute of Health, the Ministry of Health, PAHO, and WHO, show that we are facing a pressing health problem that we can't ignore. We have an epidemic of dengue fever and an outbreak of visceral leishmaniasis simultaneously in Huila and Neiva," she said.

The experience of professionals from other countries will reinforce the technical-scientific team to give the community the attention it requires and that the problem does not get out of hand. "If we don't do it this way, we face a more serious situation," she stressed.

Emma Constanza Sastoque, Department Health Secretary, confirmed that the Ministry of Health has scheduled a visit to Neiva on Wed 27 Jul 2012, with the health ministers of Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. "The purpose of the meeting is to implement a long-term education strategy, which includes a massive publicity campaign, so that communities prevent dengue and leishmaniasis," she said.

The official said the outbreak of dengue fever is still present in Huila. "7 people have died, according to tests conducted by the INS [National Health Institute]. 5 deaths occurred in Neiva, one in Timana, and one in Campoalegre. To date, 3570 cases of dengue have been reported," she said.

WHO and PAHO issued an alert in Huila on the spread of dengue due to the increasing heat wave, which facilitates the circulation of the vector. "People have to understand that dengue does not disappear with the rain, but that the foci of infection are in the home in the pool, in the tank, or in any container where water residues are improperly stored," he said.

Sastoque said that the Huila and Neiva Health Secretariats have joined forces to overcome the current epidemiological crisis, assure the public of the design of protocols for environment and vector control, as well as train doctors in the region.

"Attention to the population must be comprehensive in prevention, promotion, and supply of the drugs required. All teams are working in different areas, for the community," she said.

[Visceral leishmaniasis is less common compared to cutaneous leishmaniasis in Colombia. Visceral leishmaniasis has a high mortality if not treated. Proper control is based on identification of the animal reservoir and control of the sandfly vector.

A recent review of leishmaniasis in Andean countries including Colombia underlines the complex epidemiology: Davies CR et al: The epidemiology and control of leishmaniasis in Andean countries. Cad Saude Publica. 2000; 16(4): 925-50; available at http://www.scielosp.org/pdf/csp/v16n4/3598.pdf.
