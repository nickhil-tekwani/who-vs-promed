A man died from the H7N9 strain of bird flu in east China's Shanghai Municipality on Wednesday [26 Jun 2013], local health authorities said. The 56-year-old Shanghai native died early Wednesday morning [26 Jun 2013], the Shanghai Municipal Health and Family Planning Commission said. It was confirmed that he had been infected with the H7N9 virus on Thu 11 Apr 2013.

Shanghai has so far reported 33 human infections. While 15 of these patients have made full recoveries and been discharged from hospitals, 16 died and the remaining 2 are still being treated, the commission said.

[The length of time between the patient's admission to hospital and subsequent death (75 days) suggests that one or more co-morbidities rather than influenza virus infection was the ultimate cause of death. Nonetheless, this death raises the total number of deaths, directly or indirectly, of patients infected by the A(H7N9) avian influenza virus to 40 during the course of the outbreak.

A preceding Xinhua report (9 Jun 2013) stated that a total of 131 A(H7N9) avian influenza cases has been reported on the Chinese mainland, including 39 that have ended in death. Of that total, 78 H7N9 patients have been discharged from hospitals after receiving treatment. The other 14 patients are being treated in hospitals, according to the National Health and Family Planning Commission. All of China's confirmed H7N9 virus cases have been isolated and there has been no sign of human-to-human transmission, the commission said (http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2013-06/09/c_132444838.htm). - Mod.CP
