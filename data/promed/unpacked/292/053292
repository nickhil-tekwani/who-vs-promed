The WHO/FAO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on
Leptospirosis, Queensland Health Scientific Services, Brisbane, Australia,
reports 58 confirmed leptospirosis cases for the first two and a half
months of 1999. This compares with 16 cases for the same period in 1998
and a total of 108 cases for that year. The majority of cases are from
North Queensland and involve a range of animal and agriculture based
industries. The reference laboratory associates higher, prolonged rainfall
and flooding episodes in North Queensland for placing humans at greater
risk of contracting the disease. Greater awareness of the disease amongst
the community and clinicians has resulted in increased testing and
diagnosis. At least 8 different serotypes of leptospiral infection have
been recorded in this period as infecting patients, with serotypes "zanoni"
and "hardjo" accounting for over 50% of the disease for 1998 and 1999.
The leptospiral organism is shed in the urine of rodents and domestic
animals contaminating soil, mud and water, and is able to survive for
extended periods (up to weeks) in favourable conditions. Humans are at
risk through exposure of abraded or sodden skin to these potentially
contaminated sources. The disease can cause a range of symptoms, which
vary from a mild flu-like illness to the more severe renal involvement,
liver failure and pulmonary haemorrhage.
