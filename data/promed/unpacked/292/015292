Root rot concerns garlic growers
--------------------------------
[Garlic] farmers in Barisal district [Barisal division] are concerned that if action is not taken immediately, a root-rotting disease could affect their expected output. The disease decomposes the root and bulb and withers the plants, ultimately killing them.

A farmer said, "Seventy per cent of my crop is damaged because of the disease." Another garlic grower said around 50 per cent crop of his crop has been damaged.

Plants are getting dry and roots are rotting rapidly. As a result, many farmers are harvesting their crop much earlier this year [2016].

[A number of fungi can affect garlic (_Allium sativum_) as well as onion (_A. cepa_) to cause root and basal rots, including species of _Fusarium_ (basal rot), _Phoma_ (pink rot) and _Sclerotium_ (white rot). Some nematodes have also been reported to cause similar symptoms (for example, ProMED-mail post 20111117.3388) but appear less likely in this case due to the fast onset of the disease. Root rot diseases are usually soilborne and also spread with infected plant and other materials, including agricultural implements. They are difficult to control. Disease management may include deep plowing, phytosanitation and crop rotation of several years. For fungal rots, appropriate fungicide regimes may be helpful, but agrochemicals are often of limited use for soil borne pathogens.

A suspected root rotting disease of watermelon due to excessive recent rains is also being reported from the same region (ProMED-mail post 20160324.4115462). The problem above may also have been favoured by that humidity.
