The Grant County [Washington] Health District [GCHD] announced on Tuesday afternoon [22 May 2018] that it is investigating 4 confirmed cases of whooping cough. Health officials say all 4 individuals are within a single household and risk to the community is low. However they are concerned about the risk of more cases. All family members with a "close" contact to those with whooping cough have been notified by GCHD and offered post-exposure prophylaxis with antibiotics.

The Grant County Health District urges parents to have their children vaccinated against whooping cough with the Tdap [tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis] shot.

The Eastern Idaho Public Health District [EIPHD] says 8 cases of pertussis (also known as whooping cough) have been reported in Bonneville and Madison counties since [10 Mar 2018]. That's the highest number of reported cases in the region since at least 2010. The only years that came close were 2013, 2014, and 2017 when 5 to 6 cases were reported each year.

"And the reports we get are probably just the tip of the iceberg," EIPHD epidemiologist Ken Anderson told EastIdahoNews.com. "I'm sure there are more out there that just don't get reported." Other years, there have [been] few or sometimes no cases reported.

The ongoing pertussis outbreak in Marin county, California is continuing to affect children, reported local health officials. "Most of the recent pertussis cases have occurred in school-aged children, with infants at the greatest risk for severe complications," said Dr Matt Willis, Marin county's public health officer, in a press release.

During April and May 2018, 36 pertussis cases were reported to the Marin County Department of Public Health, which is located north of San Francisco.

Previously, on [26 Mar 2018], the Marin County Health and Human Services' Communicable Disease Prevention and Control investigated 65 cases of pertussis in Marin county. The county reported 44 pertussis cases in 2017, and 30 cases in 2016. The largest pertussis outbreak in California was in 2010 when more than 9000 cases were reported.

"Other Bay Area counties are also seeing more pertussis this spring [2018]," Dr Willis said. "Only time will tell if we're heading for another outbreak of the magnitude of 2010."

There were 17 972 reported pertussis cases in the United States in 2016, including 6 infant deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
