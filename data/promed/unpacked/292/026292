According to El Mercurio (Internet edition, Feb 7), reports from Guayaquil
place the number of human leptospirosis cases at 20 (confirmed) in Guayas
and 6 possible cases in Manabi. Laboratory confirmation of serovars will
come - maybe next Monday - from CDC Puerto Rico, where the samples were
sent. Six patients died, only 3 have been confirmed as leptospirosis until
now.
According to the report, leptospirosis is usually seen as a rare disease in
Ecuador. Since 1984 when reporting began, the annual number of cases has
been around 10/yr.
The El Nino phenomenon is being held responsible for this outbreak, due to
intense heat and heavy rains. El Nino is also seen as responsible for 123
cases of malaria and 52 of dengue in Huaquillas, where insecticide spraying
has been going on since last Monday, Feb 6.

According to press reports (El Comercio) the total cases of leptospirosis
in Ecuador has increased to 26 with 20 in the province of Guayas and 6 in
the province of Manabi. Of the 8 deaths ascribed to the disease only 3 had
been confirmed as due to leptospirosis. The other cases awaited
confirmation.
Authorities are surprised by the mortality seen and ascribe it to delays in
seeking treatment. The increase in cases (10/year is the usual incidence)
is ascribed to rats leaving flooded areas and entering [nearby homes. The
report further states that PAHO has recommended that rat eradication not be
carried out in flooded areas because of possible secondary consequences.

[This carries echoes of the previous severe epidemic of human & livestock
leptospirosis in Nicaragua. I hope this time we will know which serovars
are involved. While I can guess at why PAHO is correctly playing down
rodent control, maybe one of their people would care to share their
reasons. - Mod.MHJ ................................................mhj/es
