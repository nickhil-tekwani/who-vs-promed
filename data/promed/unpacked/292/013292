Epidemiological comments: The increase of numbers of livestock in Mongolia, the lack of domestic production of vaccines and nomadic pastoralism continue to contribute to the spread of the disease.

Control measures at event level
Domestic control measures applied: Surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; vaccination in response to the outbreak(s); movement control inside the country; quarantine; disinfection

[The following information comes from the project titled "Emergency assistance for the control of Foot and mouth disease in central and western regions of Mongolia," September 2020, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (http://www.fao.org/3/cb1467en/CB1467EN.pdf):

"Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious transboundary animal disease (TAD), which affects not only animals, but also livelihoods and markets through severe economic impacts. Mongolia has a nomadic livestock production system with a large FMD-susceptible population, consisting of around 30 million sheep, 27 million goats, 4 million head of cattle, 0.4 million camel and a few pigs. In recent years, the country has made great efforts to control FMD. However, the introduction and spread of the virus has remained a constant threat for livestock in Mongolia, as both neighboring countries, Russia and China, have regularly reported outbreaks over the last years.

"Between 2000 and 2017, a total of 14 FMD outbreaks occurred in Mongolia, mainly in the eastern part of the country, but the disease was not as yet endemic. In 2017, an emerging FMD epidemic was first reported near the southeastern international border with China. The virus was confirmed by the State Central Veterinary Laboratory (SCVL) as serotype O. By March 2018, the disease had spread widely and deeply in the country, including the capital city and 13 aimags (administrative subdivisions) and about 44 soums (secondary subdivisions), and became endemic in eastern Mongolia. In view of this, the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Light Industry (MoFALI) requested that FAO provide technical assistance to improve livestock health through the effective control, containment and prevention of outbreak of new cases of FMD in the eastern region, and avoidance of the spread in the central and western parts of the country."
