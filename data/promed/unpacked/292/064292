[The listed previous ProMED reports in the See Also section below are limited to 2020-2022 to save space.

Anthrax is a zoonotic disease affecting humans and livestock. "Small ruminants" are mentioned being vaccinated in South Sudan. "Animals" died and were vaccinated in Uganda. It must be emphasised time and again that to control this disease, and thereby prevent human cases, livestock in known risk areas must be vaccinated annually, and that with any suspect deaths, after laboratory samples have been taken, the animal carcasses must be burnt or buried, the contaminated ground disinfected, and the livestock vaccinated. Despite claims of spore immortality, the spores do die and after 5-6 years they can lose their toxic phages, limiting the risk further. But don't count on it. Annual vaccination is the answer and the Stern vaccine is very cheap. Thanks to Mahmoud. - Mod.MHJ
