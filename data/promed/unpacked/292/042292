All the 28 people who have had contact with 2 dead animals suspected to have been suffering from anthrax have been tested negative for the disease. Yesterday [20 Jul 2015], 22 out of the established 26 individuals who had had contact with the anthrax-infected meat had tested negative for anthrax.

It was announced on Saturday [18 Jul 2015] that a 53-year-old man from the village of Mlada Gvardiya, municipality of Vetrino, district of Varna, and his cow were infected with anthrax. Both the man and the animal died recently.

[So far so good. There are no results quoted yet for the 2nd cow that died, but for the moment, things are quiet. And the local community had the benefit of an anthrax lesson, with only one attention-catching human case. Fortunate. - Mod.MHJ
