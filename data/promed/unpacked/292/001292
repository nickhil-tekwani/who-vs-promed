At least 8 people were reported dead in Dandu division of Mandera District
following an outbreak of a mysterious disease. The dead, who include a
16-year-old Standard Seven pupil and 2 expectant mothers, succumbed to the
disease, whose symptoms include excessive vomiting, diarrhea and headache.
Speaking to The Standard in Mandera, town area councillor Muhamud Hussein
said most victims died less than 12 hours after developing the disease,
adding that children and women were the most affected. Councillor Hussein
lamented that the lack of medical officers in the expansive division had
worsened the situation, noting that the nearest dependable health facility,
Mandera District Hospital, was about 300 km away. He said drugs donated by
Danida [the Danish International Development Agency. - Mod.JW] were going
to waste at Dandu Dispensary, since there were no nurses to dispense the
medicine.
He appealed to the Ministry of Health to send a team of medical officers to
the area, saying that 6 other people had been admitted in hospital.
A medical officer at Mandera District Hospital said they had dispatched a
team of medical officers to take samples of the blood of patients to
identify the disease. The medical doctor, who declined to be named, said
the deaths might have been caused by an outbreak of malaria. He said
personnel had been dispatched to the division to contain the disease.

[Mandera lies at the border between Kenya, Ethiopia, and Somalia. Without
further information, any attempt to suggest the cause of this outbreak
would be only an educated guess. Malaria (as suggested) is certainly a
possibility, but diarrhoea and vomiting point to gastrointestinal illness
-- like typhoid -- as a likely course. Any further information would be
appreciated. - Mod.EP]
