Yellow fever alert in Minas Gerais state, Brazil
------------------------------------------------
The Minas Gerais State in Brazil is on alert due to an outbreak of yellow
fever that has killed at least one person. Since 25 Dec 2002, 26 suspected
cases of yellow fever have been notified and 5 cases have died in the city
of Lucas located 326 km from Belo Horizonte (state capital) in the rural
area of the state.
Disease transmission has occurred close to the Guanhaes River and most
cases were young farmers. In order to avoid new cases, teams of specialists
have been sent to the region to conduct vaccination of the population and
to try to identify new cases. Six blood samples were analyzed by FUNED
(state referral laboratory) and 4 came out positive. Out of these 4
confirmed cases, one died last Friday (10 Jan 2003). Two other confirmed
cases are recovering well and one presented neurological complications
(hemorrhagic stroke).
The 35 cities around the outbreak region should be avoided by
non-vaccinated people. The last yellow fever outbreak in Minas Gerais state
occurred in 2001, in the mid-west region of the state, in the city of
Leandro Ferreira, 144 km from Belo Horizonte. At that time, 32 cases were
notified with 16 deaths.

[According to a report in the Jornal do Brasil of 18 Jan 2002 (see Yellow
fever - Brazil (Minas Gerais) 20020121.3343), a case of sylvatic yellow
fever was notified and confirmed in Bom Despacho, west-central region of
Minas Gerais. This is the same region where 38 cases occurred in late
summer 2001. Another case of sylvatic yellow fever was suspected. Although
Brazil only recommends, and does not require, yellow fever vaccination of
visitors to the endemic areas, it is advisable for travellers to be
vaccinated. - Mod.CP]
