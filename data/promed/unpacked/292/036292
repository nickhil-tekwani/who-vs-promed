POSPIVIROIDS, TOMATO SEED - AUSTRALIA: QUARANTINE INTERCEPTIONS

_Columnea latent viroid_ (CLVd) was intercepted by Australian quarantine authorities in a shipment of tomato seed sent from a country in the Middle East in recent weeks. Samples from the shipment were tested by reverse transcription PCR, and genetic sequences were matched to CLVd sequences in the international databases.

The shipment was also found to be carrying _Citrus exocortis viroid_ and _Pepper chat fruit viroid_. CLVd is the 5th viroid species intercepted in tomato seed shipments by Australia [see also ProMED-mail post 20121115.1410163] since PCR testing was implemented for all shipments.

A decision to re-export or destroy the consignment by the seed importer is pending, according to Australian regulations. Australian authorities have not intercepted CLVd before and have not detected it in field surveys. Australia began testing tomato seed for a range of pospiviroids in 2012.

More details about this detection will be published shortly on the website of the International Plant Protection Convention (https://www.ippc.int/index.php).

[_Columnea latent viroid_ (CLVd), _Pepper chat fruit viroid_ (PCFVd), and _Citrus exocortis viroid_ (CEVd) are all members of genus _Pospiviroid_ with type member _Potato spindle tuber viroid_ (PSTVd). These 4 (and additional) pospiviroids have been found in naturally infected tomatoes. They can also infect potatoes and other solanaceous crop and weed species. In tomato, symptoms may include chlorosis, discolouration, and distortion of leaves, flower, and fruit production may cease, and plants may be stunted. However, severity of symptoms may vary.

The viroids are exceptionally stable and can survive in sap or dry plant matter for considerable times. They can be spread with infected plant material (including tissue cultures), by or on seed, and by mechanical means. Only in the presence of _Potato leafroll virus_ can PSTVd also be transmitted by an aphid vector (_Myzus persicae_). Information on possible insect transmission of the other pospiviroids is still lacking.

Disease management may include plant hygiene measures (removal of pathogen reservoirs), crop rotation, and use of certified clean seed and other propagation materials. Quarantine measures based on reliable diagnostic methods, as mentioned above, are needed to prevent viroid introductions into new areas.

Due to their potential effects on a number of very important crops, pospiviroids are also considered an emerging phytosanitary threat, for example, in Europe (see links below).
