Aussie holiday-makers are being struck down by a debilitating and potentially fatal mosquito-borne virus [The mortality statement is inaccurate. Unlike dengue virus infections, chikungunya virus infections are seldom if ever fatal. - Mod.TY].

The number of people returning from vacations to Bali and other parts of Asia with the chikungunya virus has skyrocketed this year [2013] and is expected to climb further during the upcoming wet season.

There is no cure for the virus that is carried by only 2 species of mosquito and causes fevers, nausea, a rash, and intense joint and muscle pains that can linger for months and leaves some victims hospitalised or bed-bound for weeks.

Medical experts say too many travellers are complacent about the threat of mosquitoes in Southeast Asia and neighbouring regions, including tourist hot spots like Bali, India, and Singapore, and in Papua New Guinea.

Unlike malaria, there are no medications to prevent chikungunya [virus infection], but mosquito researcher Dr Cameron Webb said the chances of avoiding being bitten improved 10-fold when reliable repellents were used properly. Dr Webb, of the University of Sydney, said trusted insect repellents that contain the ingredients DEET or picaridin should be bought in Australia to be taken on overseas travel and should be applied liberally throughout the day. "There's a tendency sometimes in Australia that we spray repellent as if we're spraying perfume ... but it must be used more like sunscreen," Dr Webb said.

A potentially fatal mosquito-borne virus is leaving travellers bed-bound for weeks. "If people don't take the repellent with them on holidays, there may not be an available supply in the destination (they are visiting), or those available may not meet the standards (we expect in Australia)."

Unfortunately, he said, warnings about dangerous mosquitoes were too often being ignored. "I think that probably people are becoming complacent," Dr Webb said. "Once they get to the destination, the mosquito populations might not be as abundant as they're used to in Australia (which creates a) false sense of security and complacency."

The mosquitoes that carry chikungunya [virus] are breeding in many of the busy tourist areas of popular holiday destinations, surprising travellers, who only expect to encounter them outside the cities, Dr Webb said. "They're not in the jungles and not in the wetlands; they're breeding in urban areas of Southeast Asia, around your accommodation, the cities, and towns that you're visiting."

A record number of Australians have contracted chikungunya [virus infection] this year [2013], 107 in the 1st 9 months compared to only 19 last year [2012] and 37 in 2011.

Dr Richard Gair, director of Tropical Public Health Services, said that of the 2 mosquito species that spread the virus, only one is found in Australia. The species [_Aedes aegypti_], which is also responsible for spreading dengue fever, only survives in the tropical climate of far north Queensland and has so far not caused a domestic outbreak of chikungunya [virus infection]. But authorities are on high alert, and a team is dedicated to closely monitoring for any cases.

[This is yet another example of frequent arrival of infected individuals in localities where these diseases do not occur. Given the presence of competent chikungunya virus mosquito vectors in northern Queensland state, there is risk of ongoing transmission. That is what happened when a chikungunya viremic individual came to Italy where a different vector, _Aedes albopictus_, was established, triggering a limited outbreak. The advice to avoid mosquito bites in both urban and rural settings when abroad in endemic areas is sound.
