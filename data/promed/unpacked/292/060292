Potato farmers in Hoshiarpur and Jalandhar are advised to spray
fungicide on their crop as traces of infection of late blight have
been found in some fields in the regions. Recent visits by scientists
of Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) Department of Plant Pathology
to growers' fields in the regions have shown signs that potato crops
may be infected with late blight, a PAU spokesman said here
[Ludhiana] today [12 Nov 2007].

He said cloudy weather and intermittent rain during November-December
favour the rapid development of this disease. Since the weather is
becoming favourable and infected potato seed has been used at some
places, the disease may develop, he said, adding that the timely
protective fungicide spray would help save the crop from late blight
induced losses.

Farmers are advised to immediately go for spraying the crop. It
should be ensured that the foliage be covered completely with
fungicide.

[Potato late blight (PLB) is caused by the fungus _Phytophthora
infestans_, which can also infect other solanaceous crops such as
tomato or eggplant. It is one of the most important potato diseases
worldwide and affects leaves as well as tubers. The fungus is spread
by plant material (including seed tubers), wind and water, and
solanaceous weeds can serve as pathogen reservoirs. Other fungi and
bacteria often invade blight-infected tubers resulting in total tuber
breakdown. Disease management includes preventative fungicide
treatments of seed tubers, but the report above states that this has
not been applied at all locations in the region.

In India, infected seed potatoes are typically the main source of
disease inoculum, and losses of up to 75 percent have been reported
previously in some areas. In the subtropical plains, conditions
favourable for PLB are generally limited, but in the hills the
conditions are highly congenial for the disease. Several PLB
resistant varieties are being deployed around the country. PLB is
considered an increasing problem in India and a forecasting model has
been developed to determine the timing of fungicide applications.

Worldwide, considerable variation in aggressiveness between different
isolates of _P. infestans_ has been observed. There are 2 mating
types, A1 and A2. Where both are present, reproduction occurs
sexually as well as asexually, leading to greater variation and
fitter strains with higher fungicide resistance and increased yield
losses. A1 occurs worldwide; A2 was 1st recorded in India in the
northwestern hills in 1990, and is also present in northern Europe,
northern and Central America, and parts of Asia. A severe form of PLB
was responsible for the Irish potato famine in the late 1840s, which
resulted in large-scale population loss from that country due to
deaths and emigration. New and even more virulent strains continue to
emerge, some of which can destroy a potato plant in a matter of hours
and a complete crop within days.
