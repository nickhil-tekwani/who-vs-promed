Republic of the Congo: 33 More Ebola Cases Reported
--------------------------------------------------
7 people have died in northwestern Congo after 11 died earlier this
month, say health officials. The latest outbreak of Ebola is believed
to have started when a family ate a wild boar they had found dead.
Health workers have blamed the rapid spread of the disease on
traditional practices, such as washing and kissing the body of the
dead. The same region was quarantined last year, after an outbreak of
the highly contagious disease killed 100 people. The new deaths were
recorded in Mbomo and Mbanza in Cuvette Ouest province.
33 more cases have been reported in the area, but heavy rains are
hampering efforts to fight the outbreak. Aid agency Medecins sans
Frontieres (MSF) says it took their team 4 days to travel the 728 km
from Brazzaville to the affected area. MSF is training burial teams
using culturally sensitive yet safe techniques for preparing and
burying the dead. "It is most distressing that 5 trained health
workers have now died of Ebola in Cuvette Ouest since 2002, and yet
we see very little effort to improve access to healthcare, train new
staff, or care for the victims of this and other sickness in the
Republic of Congo," said MSF head of mission Paul Foreman.
Ebola passes quickly from person to person, through bodily fluids
such as mucus, saliva, and blood. It causes massive internal
haemorrhaging and leads to death in as many as 90 percent of those
who become infected.
