The brains of an ibex and a chamois from the affected alpine area in
Switzerland were examined histologically at the Reference Center for
Spongiform Encephalopathies in Animals in Berne, Institute of Animal
Neurology, P.O. Box 2735, CH-3001 Bern, and both indeed showed the typical
lesions of a tickborne encephalitis. The strong suspicion was issued
already last week and the definite report on October 15 1997. Though the
animals usually graze on high altitude, they are occasionally met lower
down in forested areas. Their habitat is no argument against tickborne
encephalitis. It must be emphasized that there was no lesion suggesting a
spongiform encephalopathy as obviously feared by some.
[Thanks very much for the difinitive diagnosis of this disease situation in
Switzerland. Thanks also to Ivo Foppa for his previous suggestion of tick
borne encephalitis. -Mod. PC

It would be nice to have a detailed description of the encephalic
histopathological changes. It would be an excellent point to start (or to
arrive) to a diagnosis.
Amongst the differential diagnoses I would like to include:
1) Listeriosis: _Listeria monocytogenes_ is very common in sheep and it is
present in other ruminants. _Listeria_ can induce epidemics, especially
when contaminated silage is used to feed animals. Sometimes in the Alps
the "rangers" help the wild ruminant population feeding them during the
winter. _Listeria_ induce a pathognomonic lesion in the brainstem
consisting of a non suppurative perivascular rombencephalitis with
microabscesses. The bacteria are present in large number and easily
detectable with immunohistochemistry on tissue sections. The central
nervous system is often well preserved even when the viscera of the body
cavities are severely autolysed. The diagnosis can be obtained also from
frozen tissues. Bacteriology and the recently developed PCR (see M.
Wiedmann et al.) are also powerful diagnostic procedures.
2) Parasitic migration: ruminants can be often paratenic hosts of helminth
larvae, which produce severe mechanical damage in the central nervous
system during their migration. They induce a characteristic migration
track. In North America _Paraelaphostrongylus tenuis_ is a good example:
it is well adapted to white tail deers but it induces fatal lesions in
sheep and other ruminants. _Ascaridae larvae_ are also responsible.
Generally these conditions does not occur in epidemics, but they need to be
ruled out.
3) Viruses: to the viruses previously discussed, I would like to include
caprine arthritis encephalitis virus, which is able to induce encephalitis,
pneumonia, mastitis and arthritis. The lesions in the CNS are targeting
mainly the white matter. The transmission is often vertical through the
colostrum.
In the area of the epidemic there are several governmental diagnostic
laboratories and veterinary schools (e.g. Turin, Zurich, Bern, Milan,
Padova, Munich, Lyon, Bologna, Parma, Brescia, and many others); all of
them have veterinarians and other specialists which could resolve this
problem.
The staff of Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine would be
also more than happy to be of assistance.
