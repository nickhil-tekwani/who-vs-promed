Viet Nam: German measles casts shadow over Ho Chi Minh City
-----------------------------------------------
Up to 798 people, mostly female workers, in Viet Nam's southern Ho
Chi Minh City have suffered from rubella -- a contagious viral
infection with mild symptoms associated with a rash -- since November
2004. Most of the patients are from Cu Chi District, and they work in
industrial parks in the city, the local newspaper Labor reported on
Fri 18 Mar 2005.
To deal with the situation, local health agencies are strengthening
vaccination among residents, especially young women at universities
and factories, and children aged 12-24 months. They are also urging
people to improve hygiene in their living and working environments.
German measles, also known as rubella, or 3-day measles, is caused by
a virus that is spread through the air or by close contact. It can
also be transmitted to a fetus by a mother with an active infection,
causing severe disease in the fetus. In children and adults, rubella
is usually mild and may even go unnoticed.

[Rubella is endemic world-wide. It is a vaccine-preventable disease,
and vaccination is universal in most developed countries.
Consequently, ProMED-mail rarely reports outbreaks of rubella. The
current outbreak in Ho Chi Minh City attracts attention because of
its extent and the age groups affected, which suggest either a
breakdown in vaccine coverage or an inadequacy of the vaccine
employed. Unlike many other infectious disease problems afflicting
Viet Nam at the present time, no vector or alternate host is
involved. (_Rubella virus_ is the sole representative of the genus
_Rubivirus_ of the family _Togaviridae_). The disease rubella, or
German measles, is generally benign in children and adults.
Congenital transmission is the most serious consequence of rubella
virus infection, and virus infection of the fetus during the 1st
trimester of pregnancy can result in a constellation of serious
immunological and neurological birth defects known collectively as
the congenital rubella syndrome. In view of the involvement in Ho Chi
Minh City of a large number of young adult women, it will be
advisable for the local health-care authorities to undertake
surveillance for congenital rubella syndrome in the wake of such an
outbreak. - Mods.MPP/CP]
