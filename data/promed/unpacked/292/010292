15 cases of tick-borne encephalitis [the exact diagnosis, given the
fatality reported below, is unclear - Mod.LL] were registered in the Omsk
region of Russia.
In the Omsk region, 2262 people were bitten by ticks this summer
[presumably these were the tick bites reported to the authorities -
Mod.LL]. 15 of them, including 4 children, were diagnosed with tick-borne
encephalitis or Lyme disease [one or the other? - Mod.LL], according to
information provided by the regional center of Federal Sanitary
Epidemiological Surveillance.
One young man from Bolsherechye admitted to a regional infectious diseases
hospital died from encephalitis, according to Valentina Pahotina, chief of
the parasitological department of the regional center of Federal Sanitary
Epidemiological Surveillance.
The highest level of tick activity was registered in Tarsk, Sedelnikov,
Kolosov, Znamensk, Bolsheukovsk, Krutinsk, Muromzevsk, and Tevriz
regions. No cases of tick bites were registered in [areas where]
children's camps [are located]. August-September is the time of high
activity of meadow ticks, which can be transmitters of encephalitis. Tick
activity decreases when daily temperature dip below 8 C.

[ProMED would like more information regarding these cases. Lyme disease is
caused by _Borrelia burgdorferi_, whereas classical tick-borne encephalitis
is a viral disease. The neurological symptoms of lyme borreliosis are an
aseptic meningitis or a 7th cranial nerve paralysis (which may be bilateral).
TBE is caused by tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), a member of the
family Flaviviridae, initially isolated in 1937. A closely related virus
in Far Eastern Eurasia, Russian spring-summer encephalitis virus (RSSEV),
is responsible for a similar disease with a more severe clinical
course. Ticks act as both the vector and reservoir for TBEV.
The main hosts are small rodents, with humans being accidental hosts. Large
animals are feeding hosts for the ticks, but do not play a role in
maintenance of the virus. The virus can chronically infect ticks and is
transmitted both transtadially (from larva to nymph to adult ticks) and
transovarially (from adult female tick through eggs). TBE cases occur
during the highest period of tick activity (between April and November),
when humans in rural areas are infected through tick bites. Infection also
may follow consumption of raw milk from goats, sheep, or cows. Laboratory
infections were common before the use of vaccines and availability of
biosafety precautions to prevent exposure to infectious aerosols.
Person-to-person transmission has not been reported. Vertical transmission
from an infected mother to fetus has occurred.
The incubation period of TBE is usually between 7 and 14 days and is
asymptomatic. Shorter incubation times have been reported after milk-borne
exposure. A characteristic biphasic febrile illness follows, with an
initial phase that lasts 2 to 4 days and corresponds to the viremic phase.
It is non-specific, with symptoms that may include fever, malaise,
anorexia, muscle aches, headache, nausea, and/or vomiting. After about 8
days of remission, the second phase of the disease occurs in 20 to 30
percent of patients and involves the central nervous system with symptoms
of meningitis (e.g., fever, headache, and a stiff neck) or encephalitis
(e.g., drowsiness, confusion, sensory disturbances, and/or motor
abnormalities such as paralysis) or meningoencephalitis. In contrast to
RSSE, TBE is more severe in adults than in children.
During the first phase of the disease, the most common laboratory
abnormalities are a low white blood cell count (leukopenia) and a low
platelet count (thrombocytopenia). Liver enzymes in the serum may also be
mildly elevated. After the onset of neurologic disease during the second
phase, an increase in the number of white blood cells in the blood and the
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is usually found. Virus can be isolated from the
blood during the first phase of the disease. Specific diagnosis usually
depends on detection of specific IgM in either blood or CSF, usually
appearing later, during the second phase of the disease. In general,
mortality is 1-2 percent, with deaths occurring 5 to 7 days after the onset
of neurologic signs. - Mod.LL]
