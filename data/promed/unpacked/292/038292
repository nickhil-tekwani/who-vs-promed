CITRUS CANKER - USA (FLORIDA): ERADICATION FAILURE

The state program to remove citrus trees infected with canker and those within
1900 feet of sick trees ended last month, but the disease itself marches on.
Discoveries since the U.S. Department of Agriculture cut off canker
eradication funding to the state Department of Agriculture and Consumer
Affairs on 11 Jan 2006 have been made in DeSoto, Charlotte and Sarasota
counties.
Additionally, infected trees have been found on numerous residential yards in
Englewood and Cape Coral.
As of now, the state will not force tree removal.
A Florida law remains on the books commanding the state to find infected trees
and remove all citrus trees within 1900 feet. While that law was enforced,
almost 12 million commercial citrus trees and 800 000 residential trees were
destroyed.
The law forcing such destruction withstood several court challenges from
homeowners and growers.
But when the USDA pulled federal funding from the canker eradication effort,
the state opted to stop destructive control measures. There was no money to
reimburse growers or homeowners for further losses.
Some grove owners said compensation expenses could total $600 million for
destroyed trees and lost income in the past 18 months. On Thursday, the USDA
announced it will provide another $100 million in funds to repay grove owners
for trees destroyed by the state in the failed war on canker. The total from
the federal government is now $436 million.
State field inspectors -- their ranks trimmed by 500 last week -- continue
combing commercial groves and finding canker.
The week the USDA declared that the war on canker couldn't be won, as a Cape
Coral orange tree tested positive for the disease.
The next week, canker turned up on 8 residential properties in Englewood and 3
more in Cape Coral. Prior to Hurricane Charley on 13 Aug 2004, Charlotte had
been free of canker. But the state says it believes Charley's winds picked up
bacteria from infected Cape Coral trees and blew it into Charlotte.
Since Charley, Charlotte has lost 36 percent of its commercial groves to
canker. In number of trees, Charlotte had 1 094 176 citrus trees uprooted and
burned. Its percentage of destruction is the highest in the state.
DeSoto lost 855 932 trees, but many others set for destruction were saved when
the USDA stopped funding the destruction.
In the most recent week of reports, 22-28 Jan 2006, the state found canker at
Tri-County grove and J Bar E grove in DeSoto; and in the Ben Hill Griffin C&S
grove in Charlotte County.
That same week, a grapefruit tree in an Englewood backyard also was confirmed
to have the disease.
Canker causes unsightly blemishes on fruit and premature fruit drop, the state
says. Blemished fruit cannot be marketed as fresh fruit, the most lucrative
segment for citrus products, the state notes.
The disease is not harmful to people, however, and fruit from an infected tree
can be consumed. The bacteria are believed to be spread by windblown rain,
birds and some animals.
Fieber said the state is now telling homeowners to call their local county
agricultural extension agent for advice on what to do with a canker-infected
tree in a residential yard. Funding to repay homeowners for destroyed trees
dried up in 2005.
"We're trying to get the extension offices up to speed," she said, "so if they
start getting a flurry of calls, they'll know what to say. Right now," she
continued, "homeowners can remove diseased trees, but they'll be doing that at
their own expense."
For grove owners, any response to news of a canker discovery is their
choice. "Any positive (infected) trees right now are being removed on a
voluntary basis," Fieber said. "In fact, all trees can be left. It's up to the
grove owner now."
The current canker outbreak is the 3rd such epidemic in the history of Florida
citrus. In all outbreaks, the only control measure has been to uproot and burn
all trees near every infected tree. The current outbreak began in 1995 in Dade
County.

[Citrus canker (CC), caused by the bacterium _Xanthomonas axonopodis_ pv
_citri_, continues to be present in Florida following a severe year for the
disease in 2005. This article provides an update on new finds of citrus canker
in January 2006 in DeSoto, Charlotte, and Sarasota counties. It puts them into
perspective with changed policies in Florida regarding citrus tree
removal/eradication since the recent (11 Jan 2006) withdrawal of federal
funding for this action. Disease management depends upon use of integrated
management programs, exclusion/sanitation procedures, selection of pathogen-
free citrus budwood with field resistance to CC, cultural control and use of
preventive sprays of copper-based bactericides. Eradication of infected
trees, a technique used heavily in every past major outbreak of CC in Florida,
is now no longer going to contribute to the management of the current ongoing
epidemic fueled in part by frequent recent hurricanes. Note that 12 million
commercial citrus trees and 800 000 residential trees were destroyed under the
now abandoned policy.
