A comment on EEEV in Venezuela
------------------------------
Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) was first recognized in Venezuela
in 1975: Walder R and Suarez OM. Studies of arboviruses in southwestern
Venezuela: I. Isolations of Venezuelan and eastern equine encephalitis
viruses from sentinel hamsters in the Catatumbo region. Int J Epidemiol
1976; 5: 375-84. [In the preceding post, the date of first isolation was
given as 1973, as implied in the abstract. - Mod.CP]
The epidemiologic/virologic situation is not as simple as it might appear.
EEEV is present only in the Western Hemisphere, but does have North
American and South American varieties (Casals J. Antigenic variants of
eastern equine encephalitis virus. J Exper Med 1964; 119: 547-65; Calisher
CH, Maness KSC, Lord RD, et al. Identification of 2 South American strains
of eastern equine encephalomyelitis virus from migrant birds captured on
the Mississippi Delta. Am J Epidemiol 1971; 94: 172-8). The early studies
have been confirmed and extended by viral genetic studies (Brault AC,
Powers AM, Chavez CL, et al. Genetic and antigenic diversity among eastern
equine encephalitis viruses from North, Central, and South America. Am J
Trop Med Hyg 1999; 61: 579-86).
Whereas the North American variety comprises a single, highly conserved
lineage and has most often been associated with pathogenicity for equines
and humans, the single South American variety has now been shown by
nucleotide sequencing, phylogenetic analyses, and serologic testing to
comprise 3 major South/Central American lineages, including one represented
by a single isolate from eastern Brazil, and 2 lineages with more
widespread distributions in Central and South America. Thus there are now
recognized one North American and 4 South and Central American subtypes.
The South and Central American subtypes have not been associated with
outbreaks or epidemics of human or equine disease, although clusters or
cases and individual cases of EEE have been reported. Most isolates of EEEV
in Venezuela have been obtained from mosquitoes and sentinel hamsters
(Walder R, Suarez O, Calisher CH. Arbovirus studies in the Guajira region
of Venezuela: Activities of eastern equine encephalitis and Venezuelan
equine encephalitis viruses during an interepizootic period. Am J Trop Med
Hyg 1984; 33: 699-707).
The recent detection of EEEV in a horse in Yaracauy State either may
reflect an isolated incident or be indicative of changing virulence of the
virus -- and warrants further study and more intense surveillance.
