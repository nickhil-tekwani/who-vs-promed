The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources reports that more fish
infected with the fish-killing viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS)
virus have been found in Lake Superior.

The lake herring netted off the Apostle Islands are the 3rd confirmed
discovery of the virus in Lake Superior after announcements in
January 2010 that fish from the Twin Ports harbor and near Whitefish
Bay in Michigan had traces of the disease.

Mike Staggs, Wisconsin fisheries director, told the Duluth News
Tribune on Tuesday [13 Apr 2010] that there's no longer any doubt VHS
is in Lake Superior and all 5 Great Lakes.

VHS is harmless to people but often lethal to fish. It can cause fish
to die of internal bleeding.

Officials say they will work to keep the virus from spreading to other waters.

[Viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS) virus is an extremely serious
pathogen of fresh and saltwater fish and is causing an emerging
disease in many lakes of the United States and Canada.

Viral hemorrhagic disease affects freshwater and saltwater fish. The
causative virus is in the family _Rhabdoviridae_ and is a
_Novirhabdovirus_. The disease can be transmitted by asymptomatic
carriers, or by clinically ill fish. It can be transmitted through
the water or through direct contact. The virus is also carried in
sexual fluids, urine and feces. When the water has an overall
temperature of 20 C [68 F], the infectivity of the virus is lost in
approximately 24 hours. Conversely, the infectivity is maintained for
several days when the water temperature is a constant 4 C [39.2 F].
Therefore, it stands to reason that the incubation time is related to
water temperature and ranges from between 7 and 15 days.

The disease transmits easily between fish of all ages. Mortality is
highest at low water temperatures between 37-54 F (2.7-12.2 C). Some
fish will show no external signs, while others show signs that
include bulging eyes, bloated abdomens, inactive or hyperactive
behavior, and hemorrhaging in the eyes, skin, gills, and at the base
of the fins. Infected fish may also have lesions that look like those
caused by other fish diseases, therefore testing is necessary to
determine whether the fish is infected with VHS virus.

There are 3 different syndromes associated with the virus outbreak.
Those 3 symptoms include nervous, chronic and acute. They may overlap
to the point that all of these may be seen at one time during an
outbreak. Some fish may hemorrhage, some may be seen to have
neurological signs, such as swimming in circles. It is considered a
reportable disease in many states in the USA.

VHS has been found specifically in the waters of Lake Huron, Lake St
Clair, Lake Erie, Lake Ontario, and the St Lawrence River. Due to its
high mortality and severe economic consequences, VHS is classified as
a reportable disease by the World Organisation for Animal Health
(OIE). - Mod.TG]
