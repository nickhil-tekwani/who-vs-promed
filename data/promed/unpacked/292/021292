Indonesian woman dies of suspected bird flu
-------------------------------------------
A 30 year old Indonesian woman died of suspected bird flu on Saturday [3
Nov 2007], the country's Health Ministry said here. The woman from
Tanggerang town on the outskirts of Jakarta died on Saturday in a
designated bird flu hospital of Persahabatan in east Jakarta, said Harris
Subiantro, an official of the anti-bird flu center of the Ministry. One of
2 laboratories' tests, which are needed for confirmation, indicated that
she was positive for avian influenza, said the official. "One of laboratory
tests has showed positive," he told Xinhua.

The woman had history of contact with some of hundreds chickens that
suddenly died last month [October 2007] in her residence, he said. "She had
contact with dead chickens belonging to her neighbors," said Subiantoro. If
the woman's case is confirmed, it will [raise] the death toll to 90 out of
112 cases in the bird flu hardest-hit country, he said. Her child and niece
who were suspected of having the disease, were not under suspicion, said
the official.

The woman began to [exhibit signs of avian influenza virus infection] on 23
Oct 2007 and went to clinics 5 days later in the town, said the official.
She was admitted to a hospital in Tanggerang town on 30 Oct 2007 and was
shifted to Persahabatan hospital in East Jakarta one day later, said
Subiantoro.

[The huge extent of the country], the traditional way of rising chickens in
back yards, and lack of obedience to provincial administration in
implementing the Jakarta decision to stop the virus spread are among the
obstacles to fighting bird flu in this country.
