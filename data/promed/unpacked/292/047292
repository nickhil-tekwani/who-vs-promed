Foot and mouth disease in South Africa:
Immediate notification report.
Information received on 7 Aug 2006 from Dr Botlhe Modisane, Senior
Manager of Animal Health, National Department of Agriculture, Pretoria:
Report date: 7 Aug 2006.
Reason for immediate notification: re-occurrence of a listed disease
or infection in a country or zone/compartment following a report
declaring the outbreak(s) ended.
Identification of agent: foot and mouth disease (FMD) virus serotype SAT3.
Date of first confirmation of the event: 31 Jul 2006.
Date of start of the event: 31 Jul 2006.
Clinical disease: yes.
Nature of diagnosis: clinical and laboratory.
Details of outbreaks:
Two outbreaks were detected, both in the province Limpopo,
district/municipality Vhembe - Thulamela, affecting bovines.
The specific locations were 2 dipping tanks in a communal farming
(rural) area next to the Kruger National Park within the FMD buffer
zone of South Africa.
One - in Matiane, Lat 22.44.38.S, Lon 30.58.53.E;
the other one in Joseph, Lat 22.46.19.S, Lon 30.58.09.E.
Out of 1300 susceptible bovines, there were 41 cases. No deaths; no
destruction or slaughter of the affected/exposed animals practiced.
Source of outbreaks or origin of infection: contact with wild animals.
Control measures undertaken:
1. control of wildlife reservoirs;
2. quarantine;
3. screening;
4. vaccination;
5. disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s).
Other details/comments:
The outbreak occurred within the vaccination area of the FMD buffer
zone of South Africa. The area is almost completely fenced off.
Strict permit control is enforced. The outbreak area has been
quarantined, roadblocks have been implemented and gate control at the
gates in the fences has been improved.
The area was vaccinated against FMD in April 2006 and again in June
2006. [This might explain the low morbidity rate. - Mod.AS]
A portion of the Kruger National Park fence was not secure in the
area due to construction work being done on the fence. It is assumed
that contact between infected Kruger National Park African buffalo
(_Syncerus caffer_) and cattle took place.
This outbreak occurred well within the OIE recognised buffer zone of
the FMD control zone of South Africa adjacent to the Kruger National
Park. The status of South Africa's "FMD free zone without
vaccination" has not been affected by this outbreak, and therefore
South Africa's FMD status has not changed and the export of animals
and animal products from South Africa is not affected (i.e. the
zoosanitary status remains unchanged).

[The OIE notification provides the information requested earlier (see
1st ProMED-mail reference below)
Recent FMD outbreaks in neighbouring Botswana were caused by
serotypes SAT 1 (see 20060625.1765) and SAT 2 (see 20060610.1622).
The current outbreak in Limpopo is a reminder of the continued
presence of the 3rd "South African Territory" (SAT) serotype in the
region, namely SAT 3.
The list of 7 OIE Member Countries having an FMD free zone where
vaccination is not practised, according to the provisions of Chapter
2.2.10. of the Terrestrial Code, currently includes Argentina,
Colombia, Malaysia, Namibia, Peru, Philippines and South Africa. For
details of their respective free zones, see
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/en_fmd.htm#Liste>. - Mod.AS].
