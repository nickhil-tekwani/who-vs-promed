North Dakota health officials say 3 people have contracted Legionnaire's disease linked to a hotel water park in Casselton [North Dakota].

The 3 people became sick between last July [2018] and January [2019], and all 3 reported spending some time at the Days Inn of Casselton.

The Health Department says anyone who spent time at the hotel this month [February 2019] and has become sick should see a doctor.

Legionnaire's is a type of pneumonia caused by _Legionella_ bacteria. Symptoms include fever, fatigue, headache, muscle aches, chills, shortness of breath, loss of appetite and coughing. 10 cases were reported in the state last year [2018].

[The Days Inn hotel of Casselton, ND/Governors' Conference Center (http://www.governorsinnnd.com/rooms.html) has a fitness center (http://www.governorsinnnd.com/fitnesscenter.html) and an indoor water park that features a 2-story water slide, a 5-level "Kiddie Structure," 2 swimming pools, a "Leap Pad Water Walk," water basketball, water volleyball, and a large hot tub (http://www.governorsinnnd.com/indoorwaterpark.html).

According to the US CDC, about 20-25% of all legionnaires' disease reported to CDC is travel-associated (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5648a2.htm and http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2016/conveyance-transportation-issues/cruise-ship-travel). Travelers typically disperse to their homes widely separated from one another and perhaps at a very great distance from the source of infection before developing symptoms, so that a cluster of cases of legionnaires' disease in travelers associated with the same source may not be readily appreciated. A travel history is essential and should be actively sought from patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and _Legionella_ testing should be performed for those diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia who have traveled in the 2 weeks before onset of symptoms.

The news report fails to say whether any suspected water source at the hotel has been closed and cultured for _Legionella_ and, if positive, whether these water sources have been remediated.

Genotyping the clinical isolates from the 3 cases of legionnaires' disease being investigated in people who visited the Days Inn hotel of Casselton, ND water park will help establish whether this is a common source outbreak, if the genotypes matched. Matching the genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_ will identify the environmental source for the individual cases. However, if the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping. - Mod.ML
