SALMONELLA MENSTON (02)
=======================
[see
Salmonella menston: RFI 970409111238]
Date: Wed, 09 Apr 1997 12:03:40 -0800
From: Roshan Reporter <rreport@dhs.co.la.ca.us>
Salmonella serotype Menston in the United States
Data from 1985-1994 human isolates
1991 2 ( both from South Carolina)
1992 2 (1 New Mexico and 1 South Carolina)
Reference: CDC Salmonella Surveillance Annual Summary,
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
I do not have data for 1995 or 1996 yet-perhaps someone
from the CDC's Foodborne and Diarrheal Diseases Branch
could comment.
