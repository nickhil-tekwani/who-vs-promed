The first Asian soybean rust [ASR] of 2007 for Louisiana has been
confirmed in a kudzu patch in New Iberia Parish, in south-central
Louisiana. The find this early and in a place that could be a source of
rust for the Midwest is of concern, officials said.
Clayton A. Hollier of Louisiana State University said in an advisory that
his associate, Rose Berggren, found the rust on 8 May [2007] in a patch
that was infected last year [2006]. The official report on
<http://www.sbrusa.net> was made last week. The find joins 20 other
reports of soybean rust in 4 other states so far this year [2007].
"This observation is 53 days ahead of last year's 1st find," in Louisiana,
Hollier said, "which brings up many questions about the initial inoculum
source and the overall implications for the soybean crop in Louisiana and
the rest of the mid-section of the country." Hollier commented on the
delay in the announcement of 3 days: "Such an early find in the Deep South
has implications for our industry and the industry north of us. It was
indicated last year (2006) that Louisiana was probably the source of
inoculum for the Mid-South and the Mississippi and Ohio River states north
of us. That being said, the same could happen this year, especially if the
weather is wetter than last year's.
"Because of these implications, and the fact that our strategies may have
to change because of ASR's earlier presence, the delay in announcement has
everything to do with making certain that the diagnosis was correct," he
said. "Initial microscopic observations indicated to us (pathologists)
that ASR was present, but there were some abnormally shaped spores
present. The 2nd tier of results from the immunoassay test strips
indicated ASR's presence, but PCR [polymerase chain reaction] is the true
litmus test for such an important pathogen."
The soybean rust sample was positive by PCR [polymerase chain
reaction, a very fast, highly specific test - Mod.JW], too, Hollier said.

The discovery of Asian soybean rust in Louisiana last week [6-12 May 2007]
indicates this disease could move further north this summer.
Greg Shaner, Purdue University Extension plant pathologist, notes the rust
discovery in Louisiana is 53 days earlier than the first detection of rust
in that state last year[2006]. Although Florida, Georgia, and Alabama
remain dry, Louisiana has had heavy rains this month, and scattered
showers are predicted during the coming week. The weather appears ideal
for rust development.
Late last October [2006], rust appeared in Indiana. The spores that gave
rise to these infections most likely came from Louisiana, carried by
southerly winds over a 2- to 3-day period in late September.
The fact that rust is now present in the Mississippi Delta means a storm
system moving up the Mississippi and Ohio River Valleys this summer [2007]
could bring spores to Indiana in time to cause damaging disease to
soybeans, Shaner says. Purdue specialists will continue to monitor rust
development in the Delta region and watch for weather patterns that could
bring spores north. They will regularly scout sentinel plots for Asian
soybean rust.

[3] Soybean rust - USA: crop insurance

The 2007 growing season is now underway, and farm operators in some areas
have already planted many of their soybeans, and other in areas will be
planting soybeans in the next couple of weeks.
Throughout the winter and early spring, there has been considerable
discussion about the potential for Asian soybean rust in 2007, scouting
for the disease, treatment options, etc. One topic that has been discussed
recently is how an incidence of soybean rust will be handled for crop
insurance indemnity claims.
This is a rather complex issue and insurance coverage will be largely
dependent on the management practices followed by farm operators. The USDA
[United States Department of Agriculture] Risk Management Agency (RMA) has
published several pieces of information regarding crop insurance coverage
regarding crop losses from Asian soybean rust. The crop losses from
soybean rust are covered by crop insurance if the losses are unavoidable
and were due to naturally occurring events. The grower must follow "good
farming practices," work with local experts, and be able to document all
actions taken to control and manage soybean rust.
In addition to the basic Crop Insurance policy provisions, RMA has
expanded the definition of "good farming practices" relative to disease
control measures. To determine if disease control measures are considered
"good farming practices," 4 questions must be answered by agricultural
experts:
Will the recommended disease control measure:
1 - Allow the insured crop to make normal progress toward maturity?
2 - Produce at least the yield used to determine the production guarantee
or amount of insurance, including any adjustments for late planted
acreage?
3 - Not reduce or adversely affect the yield, if it is applied or not
applied to the crop?
4 - Be generally recognized for the area, or be contained in the organic
plan, if applicable?
The answers to these questions must be "positive." RMA states that if the
answer to any of the above questions is "negative," the disease control
measure would not be considered a "good farming practice." RMA does not
consider the cost or economics of the control measure for determining if
"good farming practices" have been followed.
RMA recommends documentation of the following data and information for
good documentation of soybean rust control efforts by producers:
1 - Data from local weather stations, Farm Service Agency (FSA) reports
and published articles in newspapers, newsletters and magazines.
2 - Printed and Web site information from land grant universities, the
Extension Service, crop consultants or other agricultural experts.
3 - Journals and logs that list the date of control measures and
application method, product, conditions, etc. (Include
fungicide labels).
4 - Producers should save any information, articles, etc., that may have
been used in the decision-making process for controlling Asian soybean
rust.

[Soybean rust is caused by the fungus _Phakopsora pachyrhizi_ and was
introduced into the USA in 2004. New strains with increased virulence are
emerging. Kudzu (_Pueraria lobata_), also called Japanese arrowroot, is an
introduced weed species. Soybean rust has been placed on the EPPO alert
list due to its recent and rapid spread in the Americas - see
<http://www.eppo.org/QUARANTINE/Alert_List/fungi/PHAKPA.htm>.
It is widespread in Asia and Africa, data are lacking concerning its
establishment in Europe. PCR - polymerase chain reaction - is a highly
specific molecular method using information on genetic sequences for the
reliable diagnosis of pathogens.
