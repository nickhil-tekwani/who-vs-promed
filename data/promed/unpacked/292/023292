Cause of Sea Lion Deaths Still Unknown
This is the sixth in a series of written updates on the New Zealand sea lion
mass mortality event. The updates will be issued by the Department of
Conservation on a regular basis as new information comes to hand, and will
also be available on its website, "www.doc.govt.nz".
The cause of the deaths of the threatened New Zealand sea lions is still
unknown, the Department of Conservation says.
DOC spokesperson Mike Donoghue said preliminary results from the Institute
of Virology at Erasmus University in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, had been
received. The tests proved negative for seal herpes viruses, and are, so
far, inconclusive for other types of viruses known to affect seals,
including morbilliviruses. The lab will need another 4-6 weeks before any
definitive conclusions could be drawn.
Investigations at Massey University's Cetacean Investigation Centre into the
cause of the mystery deaths were continuing. Some strains of pathogenic
bacteria, including several kinds of Salmonella, had been found in samples.
"No single bacterium identified in the test results to date is a strong
candidate for causing all the observed deaths."
DOC and Massey University are sending further samples to The Netherlands and
may consider other overseas laboratories.
The mystery disease has killed at least 53 percent of this year's pup
production (over 1600 pups) and is estimated to have killed at least 20
percent of the adult population. The total loss of adult female sea lions
could not be estimated with confidence until at least the next breeding
season in December and, possibly, until three years of pup production had
been monitored.
For further information, please contact Nicola Patrick, DOC Public Awareness
Unit on 04-4713117 or 025-571503.

[It is interesting to note that the veterinarians at the Massey University
have not, apparently, posted the gross and histological lesions presumeably
noted in the various sea lions delivered to them. There seems to have been a
consensus that the widespread deaths were due to an infective agent. Would
it be possible for someone in the know to share with us what the lesions
were, how various conditions were ruled out, and the reasons for searching
for an infective cause. - Mod.MHJ
