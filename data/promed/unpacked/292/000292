Will WHO accept notification by individual laboratories/hospitals? In our
experience WHO insists on notification through governmental channels. In
the absence of a functional reporting system within a country,
communication of information to governmental bodies and hence to WHO
becomes impossible.

[Rumina is correct -- WHO is obliged by its charter to report publicly only
what has been cleared by its Member States; but it can act on a report from
a lab or hospital by querying the WHO Representative on the spot.
Likewise, if an outbreak report appears in the media -- or on ProMED-mail
-- WHO can use it to bring pressure on the relevant government to report
it. In countries with no central government, such as Afghanistan, Somalia,
Sudan, reports have to come from hospitals & aid organizations. - Mod.JW
