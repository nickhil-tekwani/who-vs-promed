Toxic algae found in Hidden Lakes area
--------------------------------------
The west bay of Hidden Lake has been placed on health alert status by the
Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) due to toxic algae in
the water.
People who have contact with the water can develop a rash, and any animals
who drink the water could die, said Rich Webster, public information
officer with the Department of Environmental Quality. In extreme cases,
which are rare, people who have ingested water contaminated with the toxic
algae have died, he said. The west bay tested at high levels, but the rest
of the lake was low, he said.
The tests were done on samples taken the weekend of 19 Jun 2004. A DEQ
staff member was visiting the area and saw a blue-green algae that he
considered suspicious, Webster said. The man took samples of the west bay
water and algae to DEQ headquarters in Lincoln for testing.
Webster said staff members returned to Hidden Lake on Monday to collect a
second sample. The results of that test are expected today or Friday and
will be posted on the DEQ's Web site, <http://www.deq.state.ne.us>, he
said. When a lake tests high, it is tested weekly until the numbers go
down, he said.
The blue-green algae is naturally occurring, Webster said. DEQ officials
are studying the algae to determine why there is more of it this year and
why it is more toxic than in previous years. Officials have speculated that
the conditions are simply right for algae growth, he said.
Webster suggests that people who want to use the large lake at the Hidden
Lakes subdivision should use caution and stay away from blue-green algae.
Scummy-looking water and a bad smell are also signs of toxic algae, he
said. DEQ officials began testing water throughout Nebraska about 2 months
ago after an outbreak of suspicious-looking algae in a lake near Bellevue.
10-20 lakes have been sampled because either blue-green algae was found or
citizens called the DEQ with concerns, he said. Toxic algae has also been
found in the water at Mormon Island State Recreation Area near the Grand
Island Interstate 80 interchange and Windmill State Recreation Area near
the Gibbon I-80 interchange. Those lakes are on the DEQ's health advisory,
listed as low risks to the public. According to the DEQ's website, the
designation means samples indicate the amount of toxins in the water are at
a level safe for full-body recreational activities, such as swimming and
water skiing. A health advisory is in effect when toxins have been
identified and are still at detectable levels in the lake. However, they
aren't at concentrations that should pose a danger. Because these levels
are variable, people should use caution and, if an algae bloom returns, the
water should then be avoided, according to the website.
When a water health alert is in effect, the Department of Environmental
Quality advises people to avoid swimming in or consuming the contaminated
water, keep children and animals away from the water, and avoid algae
blooms, especially those that are blue-green, smell bad, or make the water
appear scummy.

[There are various blue-green algae, which can produce a variety of toxins.
Some of these toxins are very fast-acting, resulting in fatalities when
swallowed. Some of the toxins when ingested can produce liver failure. The
DEQ does not state which blue-green algae is present on the lake or which
toxic substance is being produced. Clearly, the DEQ is concerned if they
are issuing alerts. - Mod.TG]
