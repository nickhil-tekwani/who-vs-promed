Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) has killed 1 person in south eastern Iran over the past 2 months, Abbas Abbasi of Iran Veterinary Organization said on [Sun 28 May 2017]. The fatality occurred in Sistan-and-Baluchestan Province, with 2 more deaths also unofficially reported in Isfahan Province and the western province of Kermanshah via social media, he said.

People mainly contract the CCHF virus from infected ticks or contact with infected animal blood and tissue. Abbasi said those people who work with livestock or process meat products are susceptible. Shepherds, people who work in slaughterhouses, butchers, and distributors are at risk, while nurses dealing with CCHF patients could also contract the virus.

There are no vaccines available to immunize animals but precautionary measures include disinfection of livestock pens, submerging livestock in solutions for decontamination, and meat packaging safeguards. Besides, he advised the public to purchase meat from dependable outlets and avoid purchases from unregistered sources.

In 2015, the disease took the lives of 3 people in Iran, which neighbors Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iraq where the virus has had a presence.

According to the World Health Organization, CCHF's mortality rate is about 30 per cent and it is endemic to Africa, the Balkans and Ukraine, the Middle East and Central Asia. CCHF was 1st detected in the Crimea in 1944 and then in the Congo in 1969. In 2011, it was detected for the first time in ticks in Spain.

[Although sporadic surveys of CCHF in livestock and humans have been undertaken since 1970, it was not however until the 1999 outbreak that CCHF was recognized as a major public health problem http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/45102426/Crimean-Congo_hemorrhagic_fever_in_Iran_20160426-29271-ip9if.pdf.

As many as 23 out of the 30 provinces of Iran are endemic for CCHFV and Sistan-va-Balouchistan, Isfahan, Fars, Khozestan are respectively the most heavily infected provinces. The report above also refers to human cases reported from 2 of the above mentioned endemic regions.

Many different factors that affect the prevalence criteria for CCHF still remain unknown. Climate changes such as drought and warming in Iran and adjacent countries have increased tick populations and consequently numbers of CCHF cases in recent years. Therefore, human and veterinary surveillance of CCHF is an important aspect of monitoring the evolution of the virus as well as related vector distribution. - Mod.UBA
