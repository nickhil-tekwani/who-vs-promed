Walmart recalls Better Homes and Gardens Essential Oil Infused Aromatherapy Room Spray with Gemstones due to rare and dangerous bacteria; 2 deaths investigated
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Name of product: Better Homes and Gardens Essential Oil Infused Aromatherapy Room Spray with Gemstones

Hazard: Tests conducted by the CDC determined that a bottle of the room spray contained the rare and dangerous bacteria _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ which causes melioidosis, a condition that is difficult to diagnose and can be fatal. CDC has been investigating a cluster of 4 confirmed cases of melioidosis including 2 deaths in the USA. Though the source of these 4 infections has not been confirmed by the CDC, the bottle with the same type of bacteria was found in the home of one of the melioidosis decedents.

Remedy: Refund

Recall date: 22 Oct 2021

Units: About 3900

Description: Walmart is recalling about 3900 bottles of Better Homes and Gardens-branded Essential Oil Infused Aromatherapy Room Spray with Gemstones in 6 different scents due to the possible presence of a rare and dangerous bacteria and risk of serious injury and death.

The CDC tested a version of the product and determined that it contained the dangerous bacteria _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ which causes melioidosis. CDC has been investigating a cluster of 4 cases of melioidosis in the USA, including 2 deaths. Cases were reported in Kansas, Minnesota, Texas and Georgia, including a child fatality. Samples taken by CDC from a bottle of the Better Homes and Gardens Lavender & Chamomile aromatherapy room spray in the home of the Georgia victim found the presence of these dangerous bacteria.

The aromatherapy room spray was sold at about 55 Walmart stores nationwide and online at walmart.com from February 2021 through October 2021 for about USD 4. "Better Homes and Gardens Aromatherapy" is printed on the label on the front of the 5-ounce glass bottle.

[This is the US Consumer Product Safety Commission notice regarding the recalled product, which was manufactured in India.

Presumably the contamination of the product occurred there during manufacture. While the Indian subcontinent does not receive the reporting of melioidosis that areas further eastward in South Asia and North Australia receive, the disease occurs there as documented by Koshy (Koshy M. Melioidosis: An emerging infection in India. Curr Med Issues 2020;18:94-7; https://www.cmijournal.org/text.asp?2020/18/2/94/282788):

"While the true burden of melioidosis in India remains poorly understood, a 2016 modeling study has predicted a global incidence of approximately 165 000 cases worldwide with an estimated case fatality of 89 000 (54%). This study suggests melioidosis to be endemic to India with an annual incidence of approximately 52 500 cases (7). The only serosurveillance study done in India in the Southwest coastal town of Udupi estimated seroprevalence of 29% (titer 1:20 or greater) (10). Studies attempting to identify _B. pseudomallei_ from the environment have been limited (11). Periods of heavy rainfall are known to be associated with an increase in number of cases, particularly acute septicemic and pneumonic presentations (12)."
