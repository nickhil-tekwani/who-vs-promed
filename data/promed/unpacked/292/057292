The Local Health Council (Conselleria de Sanidad) agreed that 2 car
washing facilities were responsible for causing the _Legionella_
outbreak reported in June 2010, which affected 16 persons, according
to an official response from the Health Council officer, Manuel
Cervera, to a request from socialist deputy Rebeca Soler. In
June/July 2010 there were 7 additional cases in the Health Area 15,
which were classified as isolated occurrences.

Mr Cervera's report states that the origin of this outbreak "was
localized in 2 self-service car washing facilities within Alcoy
[city, province of Alicante]. These facilities complied with the
current preventive protocols and were sealed off on 29 Jun and 3 Jul
[2010]." A 3rd facility was sealed off in July 2010 and the 3 remain closed.

The aforementioned report states that since May 2010, 140 inspection
procedures have been carried out in facilities considered to be at
risk, in addition to another 2423 inspection procedures carried out
as part of active surveillance of facilities at risk, which included
the use of a helicopter that proved to be useless, according to the
health officer.

With respect to the outbreak reported in June and July 2010, the 16th
outbreak since 1999, 16 cases were reported between 31 May and 13 Jul
2010. Last June 2010 there were 5 cases not related to this outbreak,
which were consequently classified as isolated cases; 2 additional
cases were reported in July 2010. 46 field tests were performed in
the affected persons' households, but no positive results were reported.

[Legionellosis is generally acquired by inhalation of an infectious
dose of aerosolized _Legionella_. Water temperatures of 25-40 deg C
(77-104 deg F) support the highest concentrations of the organism in
water storage tanks of plumbing systems. Aerosolization of the
contaminated warm water can occur in showers, spa pools, sprays in
groceries, fountains, cooling towers, and car washes. - Mod.LL]
