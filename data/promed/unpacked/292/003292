Veterinarians for Animal Welfare Zimbabwe (VAWZ) has expressed serious concern at the "increasing" number of rabies cases in the country amid reports the disease has killed a child.

VAWZ, a Harare based animal well-being non-profit organisation, said a dog from Arcturus [Mashonaland East Province] outside the capital and a feral cat from Avondale [suburb of Harare] recently tested positive for rabies.

A young boy from Chegutu [Mashonaland West Province], added VAWZ, succumbed to the deadly disease after a neighbour's dog bit him.

There have also been unconfirmed reports of a mild rabies outbreak in rural Shurugwi.

"VAWZ is deeply concerned with the increasing number of confirmed rabies cases throughout Zimbabwe," said the organisation. It added: "We cannot stress enough the importance of having ALL your pets vaccinated annually against this deadly disease. Should you come into contact with an unknown animal, particularly one displaying unusual behaviour, please seek medical advice immediately." It said children must be warned not to interact with strange animals.

The animal welfare organisation advised people to report sightings of suspect animals to VAWZ on 0778431528 and 0775722449 or the nearest veterinary surgery.

In the absence of early detection and treatment, rabies is about 100 percent fatal.

[I think we can assume that rabies is presently widespread in Zimbabwe, and only a minority of animal & human cases are being reported. And when that happens there is minimal disease control.

For a map of Zimbabwe, go to: http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/africa/zimbabwe_physio-2002.jpg. Arcturus is in Mashonaland East Province and at: http://www.fallingrain.com/world/ZI/04/Arcturus.html. Avondale is a suburb of Harare and at: http://www.fallingrain.com/world/ZI/04/Avondale.html. Chegutu is in Mashonaland West Province to the south west of Harare, and at: http://www.fallingrain.com/world/ZI/00/Chegutu.html. - Mod.MHJ]
