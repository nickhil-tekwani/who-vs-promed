Why volcano victims [infected?
1) Disrupted sandfly environment: Sandflies normally feed on small rodents
at the forest edge. Disturb or alter the host population on that edge and
the insects seek alternative hosts.
2) Disrupted human environment: Assuming damaged civil infrastructure, or
loss of habitat, more people now in the sandfly environment. Humans become
the alternative host. Also seen when forests are cut down: the small
rodents flee that area where the forest edge used to be. The sandflies then
feed on humans cultivating that zone.

I was interested in the comment on the temporal relationship between a
supposed upsurge in cutaneous leishmaniasis and volcanic activity.
In the late 1960s there was an outbreak of plague in Central Java. The
local lore was that when there was plague the local volcano would erupt. It
did.
It was postulated that the natural reservoir of plague lived near the top of
the mountain and when the temperature of the mountain increased before
eruption the rodents headed down to mingle with the commensal rodents and
then off to man. I dont know if this legend has ever been scientifically
documented, but don't underestimate local lore. Maybe the sandflies can't
take the heat.
I mentioned this years ago to an engineer from the National Earthquake
Center and he said, Wow. We can use this as a justification for a
satellite of our own!
