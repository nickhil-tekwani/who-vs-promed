An elderly woman dies after eating red tide-contaminated oysters in El Salvador
-----------------------------------------------
A 78-year-old woman died and another 7 persons were intoxicated in El
Salvador after eating oysters presumably contaminated with red tide, a
medical source said last Tuesday [22 Nov 2005].
The elderly woman, 81 years old, died last Monday [21 Nov 2005] night after
eating oysters in Chiltiupan community, 55 km southeast of San Salvador.
Karen Gudiel, head of a health unit in Puerto La Libertad, where the victim
was cared for, said that the victim showed symptoms of intoxication, but
she added that laboratory tests will reveal the true cause of her death.
Another 7 persons, all of them relatives of the 1st victim, also were taken
care of in the same health unit after eating the same shellfish, and they
were referred afterwards to San Rafael Hospital in Santa Tecla, 12 km west
of Capital City, San Salvador.
Last Monday [21 Nov 2005], authorities from the El Salvador Agriculture and
Cattle Farming Ministry announced that a prohibition on consuming,
commercializing and extracting shellfish will still be in force in the
country, since shellfish is contaminated with red tide, and it is highly toxic.
"Monitoring indicates that toxicity levels are still high, which is
hazardous for consumers, and this is the reason why we still maintain the
prohibition for fishing and consuming shellfish in the country," Mr. Mario
Salaverria of the Agriculture Ministry said.
The prohibition on commercialization, consumption and extraction includes
black shells, clams, mussels, oysters, and sea snails.
Last week [4th week November 2005], the Health Ministry reported around 15
persons intoxicated in the country's eastern region, adding that 7 persons
had now been intoxicated in Puerto La Libertad.
Red tide develops because of high concentrations of _Karenia brevis_ algae,
which is quite toxic for humans.

[Red tide is caused by several toxic algae. Depending upon the effect the
toxin has, it is also known as paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), because
it causes shellfish to be toxic for consumption.
PSP is a significant problem in several geographic areas, especially on
both the east and west coasts of the U.S. Produced by several closely
related species in the genus _Alexandrium_, PSP toxins are responsible for
persistent problems due to their accumulation in filter-feeding shellfish,
but they also move through the food chain, affecting zooplankton, fish
larvae, adult fish, and even birds and marine mammals.
_Alexandrium_ blooms generally do not involve large-cell accumulations that
discolor the water and may instead be below the water surface, where they
are not visible. Low-density populations can cause severe problems due to
the high potency of the toxins produced. Furthermore, _Alexandrium_ spp.
can grow in relatively pristine waters, and it is difficult to argue that
anthropogenic nutrient inputs are stimulating the blooms. These
characteristics are important when considering mitigation and control
strategies.
Often PSP is associated with red tides or algal blooms. Red tide is caused
by an organism called _Karenia brevis_, which in high concentration can
make the water look red. The organism releases a toxin that paralyzes the
respiratory system of fish and other marine life.
Airborne toxins, water spray, and splashes in an outbreak have kept people
from beaches while leaving others with irritated eyes and throats. Red tide
irritates the skin of people exposed to it and can cause itchy eyes,
scratchy throats, and coughs.
Harvesting from affected areas for personal consumption is discouraged. Red
tide poisoning symptoms include nausea and dizziness and may last for
several days.
Previously, the organism causing red tide was known as _Gymnodinium breve_,
but it has been reclassified in the taxonomy of dinoflagellates. Its new
name is _Karenia brevis_, or _K. brevis_. Karenia was chosen in honor of
Dr. Karen Steidinger, a prominent red tide scientist from the Florida
Marine Research Institute in St. Petersburg, Florida.
