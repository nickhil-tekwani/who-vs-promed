[This is now the 9th newly confirmed case reported from Saudi Arabia since 1 Jan 2016; 8 out of the 9 cases gave a history of contact with camels (direct or indirect -- see WHO update below) in the 14 days prior to onset of their illness (this current case as well). It appears as though nosocomial transmission has not been identified in Saudi Arabia since 16 Dec 2016 (see prior postings). Of concern is the source of infection in the case reported in Riyadh on 1 Feb 2016, where preliminary reports ruled out direct contact with camels. The most recent prior case reported in Riyadh was on 1 Dec 2015 (see prior reports).

The location of Taif can be seen on the map available at the source URL above. - Mod.MPP]
