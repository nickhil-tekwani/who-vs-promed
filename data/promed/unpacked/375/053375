A national outbreak of a potent and rare type of salmonellosis has
health officials puzzled. Since mid-October 2008, 36 cases of
_Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium phage type 42 have been
reported nationwide, with 16 of them in Canterbury.

Environmental Science and Research started a national investigation
about a week ago, with public health units and the Food Safety
Authority trying to identify the source of the bacteria. The source
is likely to be some form of food product.

Most of the Canterbury people hit by the bug are female, with many
children and middle-aged women among them. Ministry of Health chief
adviser of population Greg Simmons said the outbreak was a
significant one.

There have been 16 confirmed cases of type 42 in Christchurch, 9 in
Dunedin, 5 in Nelson, 2 in Auckland, and 1 each in Greymouth,
Rotorua, Whakatane, and Waikato. There were 15 cases of type 42 in
2007 and 28 in 2006.

At least 5 people nationwide had needed hospital treatment.
