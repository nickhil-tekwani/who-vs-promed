Foot-and-mouth disease stalks Egypt
-----------------------------------
A new strain of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in Egypt could aggravate discontent among the rural poor and prolong the country's political turmoil.

As Egypt struggles to make a vaccine, agriculture experts fear a vicious circle has begun: political disarray helps spread animal disease, which deepens poverty and discontent -- and breeds more political disarray. Meanwhile neighbouring countries fear Egypt's virus could soon reach them.

FMD kills young cattle, buffalo, and other ruminants, weakens older ones and slashes farms' productivity. At a meeting in Bangkok, Thailand, last week, the member countries of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) launched a plan to get FMD under control worldwide by 2027 [see 20120628.1184291]. Yet the FAO cannot get money to have vaccine made out of existing stocks of ingredients for the Egyptian outbreak.

Egypt already harbours 2 strains of the FMD virus [serotypes O and A], but its livestock have some resistance to them, through either exposure or vaccination. They have none to the new strain, SAT2.

In February [2012], migrant herders also brought SAT2 to Libya, although there are slight genetic differences between the viruses in Libya and Egypt. Political upheaval in both countries means "the ability to do the right surveillance and control has been quite diminished," says Juan Lubroth, head of animal health at the FAO in Rome. He fears what could also happen if the virus turns up in Syria or Iraq.

In Egypt, where endemic H5N1 bird flu decimates poultry as well, the new losses have inflated meat prices, adding to discontent -- frustrated farmers have dumped dead animals outside government veterinary offices. New cases of FMD are now on the wane, but without widespread vaccination, says Lubroth, there will be successive waves of the disease.

With 14 million livestock at risk, Egypt says it has imported 4 million doses of SAT2 vaccine, from Botswana and the vaccine firm Merial, and that it has made 4.6 million more -- although it has had to dispense with time-consuming quality controls. Some 750 000 livestock have received the vaccine, but they will need a booster dose before they are immune, and the effectiveness of the campaign may not be clear until the next wave hits. Given Egypt's limited capacity to administer the vaccine strategically to stop the new strain spreading, for instance at live animal markets, it will simply persist, Lubroth fears.

That puts the whole region at risk: FMD is the most contagious animal virus known. European Union officials are said to be preparing contingency plans. Israel has vaccinated livestock along its southern border and given vaccine to Palestinian authorities, who have contained the virus after infected animals came to Gaza through smuggling tunnels from Egypt.

Although FAO member countries have endorsed its plan to stop outbreaks over the next 15 years using vaccination, there are no plans to eradicate the virus worldwide, partly because it persists in wildlife, such as buffalo. Regions that have eliminated it, like western Europe and North America, remain at risk from the 100 countries where outbreaks continue to occur.

[Egypt has officially submitted 5 reports on the current epizootic to the OIE, addressing a total of 49 outbreaks as of 24 Jun 2012. According to the reports, the accumulated number of cases is as follows: buffaloes -- 1955 clinical cases, 56 deaths; cattle -- 1070 cases, 83 deaths; sheep/goats -- 38 cases, 26 deaths). According to the reports, the Egyptian SAT-2 epizootic started on 12 Feb 2012, was confirmed on 4 Mar 2012, and was 1st reported to the OIE on 14 Mar 2012. The epizootic spread throughout the entire country; all 5 reports and an interactive map are available at http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=11748.

Egyptian press, citing the minister of agriculture, have mentioned numbers of cases and deaths which were at least 30-fold higher.

There are at least 2 other FMD virus circulating in Egypt, of serotypes O and A; this may have aggravated the situation. In this respect, subscribers are referred to the recent statement of WRLFMD:

"In addition to the recent cases due to serotype SAT2, a new FMDV type A lineage (which we have named A/AFRICA/G-IV[ISM-12]) was also detected in Egypt in 2012. This was found to be most closely related to viruses from Sudan and Eritrea suggesting yet another recent introduction of FMDV from sub-Saharan Africa.

"Therefore, the FMD situation in Egypt has become extremely complex with the presence of at least 5 distinct FMDV lineages between 2010 and 2012, requiring at least 3 different vaccine virus strains."

For the details of the different FMDV lineages present in the region in the last few years, subscribers are referred to the full statement, including the descriptions of the above mentioned strains, in posting 20120507.1125683.

In view of the difficulties to perform in Egypt a detailed surveillance, the actual pathogenicity and infectivity of the circulating FMD SAT-2 virus strain are in need of further study. Notably, the virus was swiftly controlled by the Palestinian veterinary authorities in the Gaza strip, where the disease remained restricted to the 1st 2 foci in cattle holdings adjacent to the Egyptian border, and did not spread. Interestingly, the (about 80 000, unvaccinated) sheep and goats in the Gaza strip have, reportedly, remained (clinically) unaffected. One might wish for serological surveillance to be carried out in the said small-ruminant population, to try to check if subclinical infection has taken place. - Mod.AS
