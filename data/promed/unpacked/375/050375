Anthrax outbreak in Saskatchewan
--------------------------------
Several cattle died earlier this month in Saskatchewan's first anthrax
outbreak since 1994.
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) said 5 cattle died from the
bacterial disease near the town of Guernsey. Several infected animals
recovered after they were treated. Connie Argue of the CFIA said she did
not know how the outbreak occurred. But Argue said anthrax [_Bacillus
anthracis_], a bacteria [bacterial species] that forms spores, can remain
stable in soil for many years. If the soil is disturbed by flooding or
drying or other activities, animals can be exposed and infected. "Cattle
may be grazing in areas that they aren't normally in. It might be a slough
area that has dried up. Excavations can also expose the virus [sic]," said
Argue.
The bodies of the cattle have been treated so the spores will not spread.
Anthrax is found all over the world and has been present on the North
American Great Plains for centuries, says Larry Shuler, North Dakota's
state veterinarian.
"Anthrax is a warm-weather disease," said Shuler. "Once we get into fall
and cooler temperatures, we will see the outbreak stop."

[Larry Shuler is correct. Early October is usually the end of the anthrax
season in the Canadian plains. Without further information it is hard to
know what started this outbreak unless it was recent earth moving
activities where carcasses had been buried in the past or a quiet ongoing
series of deaths that had been ignored until the numbers triggered the
owner to get veterinary advice. I will attempt to get the background on
this. - Mod.MHJ]
