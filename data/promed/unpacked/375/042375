Health officials in Weld County [Colorado] say they've seen an increase in the number of cases of pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, this year [2014]. County officials said they've encountered the same number of cases through early October 2014 that they saw throughout 2013. Weld County health officials have diagnosed 116 cases of pertussis this year. Students at 7 Windsor area schools are infected [Windsor, a town with a population of 18 644 in Larimer and Weld counties, is 59 miles (95 km) north of Denver, the Colorado State Capitol]. The health department notified administrators at each affected school.

"Take this seriously. It is a cough, but it is a horrible cough. It will last for months. It can cause vomiting, incredible discomfort," Eric Aakko with the county's health department said. Pertussis affects the respiratory system, causing stubborn and persistent coughing. It is very contagious and can be fatal. The best protection against pertussis is vaccination, although it does not provide life-long immunization.

Health officials said that for every diagnosed case of whooping cough, there are 9 or 10 that are not diagnosed.

[Pertussis has been on the increase throughout most of the world. This has been attributed in part to increased virulence and other genetic changes in the circulating clones of _Bordetella pertussis_, as well as waning or an ineffective immune response after vaccination. For a discussion of these problems, see moderator LL's comments in prior ProMED-mail posts on pertussis and moderator ML's comments in ProMED-mail post Pertussis - USA (04): (MT, CA) increased incidence 20140424.2426383.
