F.D.A. Finds Traces of Poison in 2 Jars of Baby Food in California
--------------------------------------------------
Tiny amounts of the poison ricin have been detected in 2 jars of baby
food that had been tampered with before being sold by a Southern
California supermarket, the authorities said Wednesday.
But the authorities said the contaminant was ground-up castor beans,
from which ricin is derived, not the purified form of the toxin,
which is far deadlier. 2 babies who ate some of the food were not
harmed.
"There is a big difference between purified toxin and crude castor
beans," said Dr. David Acheson, chief medical officer at the Food and
Drug Administration's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition.
"It is unlikely there would be serious injury from the level of
castor beans we found it the product."
The ground-up beans were found in jars of Gerber Banana Yogurt
Dessert bought from a Ralphs supermarket in Irvine, which is south of
Los Angeles in Orange County, according to the Federal Bureau of
Investigation and the Irvine Police Department.
Tony Rackauckas, the district attorney of Orange County, called it a
"localized incident."
The jars contained similar notes inside warning that the jars were
contaminated. They were discovered by parents after they had already
fed some of the food to their babies. The notes also referred to a
member of the Irvine police force. The authorities would not identify
the police officer nor indicate what was said about him or her in
the note.
The authorities released a photo of a 47-year-old man, Charles D.
Cage, whom they said they want to question.
Mr. Rackauckas said at a news conference in Irvine that was partially
televised here that he would not call Mr. Cage a suspect or even a
"person of interest." Still, Mr. Rackauckas said, "he's someone who
was in the area at a relevant time" and the authorities believe he
may have information about the matter.
The first incident was discovered on 31 May 2004. A couple brought
their 9-month-old baby to the hospital after finding a note in a jar
of baby food. The baby had eaten some of the food, authorities said.
The police reported the 2nd case after being called to a house on 16
Jun 2004. A father had found a note while rinsing out a jar of the
same type of baby food after feeding some to his 1-year-old son.
There was no food left in the jar for testing, but the Irvine police
found another jar on the family's shelf that also had a note inside,
Lt. Jeff Love, a police spokesman, said.
The news conference was held Wednesday because the results of the
tests on the food, done by the F.D.A.'s forensics laboratory, showed
that ricin and some other components of castor beans had been found.
The authorities said they wanted to warn people to make sure that
food packages they buy have not been tampered with.
Lieutenant Love said that in these cases, the parents thought the
food had not been tampered with. Baby food is supposed to make a
popping noise when opened, and the families thought they had heard
that noise, he said. But he said the vacuum that creates the popping
noise could be restored after a jar was tampered with.
"It is possible to open a jar, put something in it and then, using
heat and so forth, put it back in an appearing sealed condition," the
lieutenant said, adding that consumers should buy food that had a
seal around it for protection.
Kurt T. Schmidt, president of Gerber Products Company, said he did
not know the details of what happened in Irvine or how easy it is to
restore the seal. Mr. Schmidt said vacuum-sealed jars with pop tops
were the "industry standard'' for baby foods.
But he said Gerber had already added an additional protection, a
plastic seal, to some of its products and would now speed up plans to
add it to all its products.
The authorities said Gerber had been cooperating with the inquiry.
Gerber, which is based in Parsippany, N.J., and is a unit of the
Swiss giant Novartis, said in a statement, "We have been informed by
the authorities that Gerber was not a target and that the tampering
occurred post-production."
Gerber said it would immediately remove all of the banana yogurt
product from Southern California store. It had already been removed
from the one supermarket in Irvine

[Ricin is a toxin of the castor bean _Ricinus comunicus_. It is a
by-product of the production of castor oil. Ricin can be administered
by injection, ingestion, or inhalation. Ricin has some potential
medical uses, such as bone marrow transplants and cancer treatment
(to kill cancer cells).
In 1978, Georgi Markov, a Bulgarian writer and journalist who was
living in London, died after he was attacked by a man with an
umbrella. The umbrella had been rigged to inject a poison ricin
pellet under Markov's skin.
Production and use of Ricin as a poison is a deliberate act,
therefore the likelihood of accidental exposure is unlikely.
Furthermore, ricin poisoning is not contagious and cannot be spread
from person to person. Depending on the route of exposure (such as
injection or inhalation), as little as 500 micrograms of ricin could
be enough to kill an adult. A 500-microgram dose of ricin would be
about the size of the head of a pin. A greater amount would likely be
needed to kill people if the ricin were swallowed. The route of
exposure also determines the signs and symptoms, and there are
usually multiple organs involved. Signs and symptoms usually occur
within 8 hours of inhalation exposure but within 6 hours of ingestion.
It is likely that ricin was used in the Iran-Iraq war during the
1980s and that quantities of ricin were found in Al Qaeda caves in
Afghanistan.
Within a few hours of inhaling significant amounts of ricin, the
likely signs and symptoms would be respiratory distress (difficulty
breathing), fever, cough, nausea, and tightness in the chest. Heavy
sweating may follow as well as fluid building up in the lungs
(pulmonary edema). This would make breathing even more difficult, and
the skin might turn blue.
Excess fluid in the lungs would be diagnosed by x-ray or by listening
to the chest with a stethoscope. Finally, low blood pressure and
respiratory failure may occur, leading to death. In cases of known
exposure to ricin, people having respiratory symptoms that started
within 12 hours of inhaling ricin should seek medical care.
Someone exposed by the respiratory route is likely to have eye and
skin exposure as well. The eyes and skin are likely to be reddened
and there may be pain in both locations. Swallowing a significant
amount of ricin would result in vomiting and diarrhea that may become
bloody. Severe dehydration would result, followed by low blood
pressure. Other signs or symptoms may include hallucinations,
seizures, and blood in the urine. Within several days, the person's
liver, spleen, and kidneys might stop working, and the person could
die.
Death from ricin poisoning may be within 36 to 72 hours of exposure,
depending on the route of exposure (inhalation, ingestion, or
injection) and the dose received. If death has not occurred in 3 to 5
days, the victim usually recovers.
No antidote exists for ricin. If exposure cannot be avoided,
decontamination or removal of the ricin from the body is the next
best course of action. Supportive care is the best treatment for
ricin poisoning. The types of supportive medical care would depend on
several factors, such as the route by which victims were poisoned
(that is, whether poisoning was by inhalation, ingestion, or skin or
eye exposure). Supportive care includes respiratory support,
intravenous fluids and supportive care to minimizing seizures, low
blood pressure, nausea, etc. Flushing the stomach with activated
charcoal (if the ricin has been very recently ingested) may be
helpful in removing the toxin from the body, or washing out eyes with
water if eyes are irritated.
