Swedish health authorities have warned an outbreak of rabbit fever (tularemia) is expected to grow, with hundreds of people affected so far.

A total of 212 confirmed cases have been reported to The Public Health Agency of Sweden (Folkhallsomyndigheten) so far in 2019, sharply increasing from late July 2019. That is twice as many as in a normal year.

But Sweden has not yet seen the end of it, the authority warned on [Mon 12 Aug 2019]. "Since the number of cases (of rabbit fever) is usually at its highest in September, the outbreak is expected to grow further in the coming weeks," it wrote in a statement.

Most cases have been reported in Dalarna, Gavleborg, and Orebro counties in central Sweden, but in the past week Vasterbotten and Norrbotten have also seen an increase, often limited to a specific area.

Many of those affected by the disease have been infected via mosquito bites.

[_Francisella tularensis_ subsp. _tularensis_ (type A) is associated with lagomorphs (rabbits and hares). Wild rodents are also frequently infected, and occurrence of human cases is usually linked to these host species. _F. tularensis_ is transmitted primarily by ticks and biting flies, and is highly virulent for humans and domestic rabbits.

Tularemia is largely confined to the Northern Hemisphere and is not normally found in the tropics or the Southern Hemisphere. _F. tularensis_ subspecies _holarctica_ naturally infects several mammalian wildlife species in northern Europe, in particular, mice, rabbits, hares, beavers, voles, lemmings, and muskrats. The ticks _Dermacentor reticularis_ and _Ixodes ricinus_ are vectors for the bacterium, although previous research has suggested that mosquito bites are the most frequent route of transmission to humans in Sweden.

In addition to vector transmission, tularemia may be spread via contact with infected animals or environmental fomites by inhalation, or by ingestion of the poorly cooked flesh of infected animals or contaminated water.

Tularemia can be transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with, or ingestion of, infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbit) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional lymphadenitis), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially [pathogen remains with the vector from one life stage ("stadium") to the next] and transovarially [transmission of a pathogen from an organism (as a tick) to its offspring by infection of eggs in its ovary], making them efficient reservoirs and vectors.

The manifestations of infection in this growing outbreak in parts of Sweden are not stated. If vector borne, the most common form would be ulceroglandular with an ulcer at the introduction site and enlarged lymph nodes in that area. If waterborne, oropharyngeal would be most common. Among flying vectors, deer flies are often brought up but mosquitoes are also relevant as shown in this Swedish publication:

Thelaus J, Andersson A, Broman T, et al: _Francisella tularensis_ subspecies holarctica occurs in Swedish mosquitoes, persists through the developmental stages of laboratory-infected mosquitoes and is transmissible during blood feeding.

"Abstract
--------
In Sweden, mosquitoes are considered the major vectors of the bacterium _Francisella tularensis_ subsp. _holarctica_, which causes tularemia. The aim of this study was to investigate whether mosquitoes acquire the bacterium as aquatic larvae and transmit the disease as adults. Mosquitoes sampled in a Swedish area where tularemia is endemic (Orebro) were positive for the presence of _F. tularensis_ deoxyribonucleic acid throughout the summer. Presence of the clinically relevant _F. tularensis_ subsp. _holarctica_ was confirmed in 11 out of the 14 mosquito species sampled. Experiments performed using laboratory-reared _Aedes aegypti_ confirmed that _F. tularensis_ subsp. _holarctica_ was transstadially maintained from orally infected larvae to adult mosquitoes and that 25% of the adults exposed as larvae were positive for the presence of _F. tularensis_-specific sequences for at least 2 weeks. In addition, we found that _F. tularensis_ subsp. _holarctica_ was transmitted to 58% of the adult mosquitoes feeding on diseased mice. In a small-scale in vivo transmission experiment with _F. tularensis_ subsp. _holarctica_-positive adult mosquitoes and susceptible mice, none of the animals developed tularemia. However, we confirmed that there was transmission of the bacterium to blood vials by mosquitoes that had been exposed to the bacterium in the larval stage. Taken together, these results provide evidence that mosquitoes play a role in disease transmission in part of Sweden where tularemia recurs."
