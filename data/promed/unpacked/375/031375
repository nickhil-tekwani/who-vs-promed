The number of cholera cases in the city has risen from 305 last week to 511
at the moment in the 5 divisions of Kampala. This was revealed by the
city's director of health services, Mesach Mubiru on yesterday, 14 Dec 2006.
Dr Mubiru and a team of health inspectors that included representatives
from the WHO, Uganda Red cross, Ministry of Health, Plan Uganda, National
Water and Sewerage Corporation, and UNICEF were going around the city
sensitizing people on how to promote personal hygiene and prevent
themselves from contracting cholera while providing patients with oral
rehydration salts.
"People should only take boiled water, use latrines well and wash hands
with soap before and after meals, eat only properly prepared food and
report any cholera cases immediately," he said. In the process, the team
led by Dr Mubiru and the town clerk Ms Ruth Kijambu closed 8 residential
and commercial buildings in Kawempe Lubaga and Makindye divisions due to
poor sanitation.
Houses in Kinyogoga, an area in Namuwongo, Makindye division, Nateete in
Lubaga and Kawempe division were closed because they lacked proper latrine
facilities. Dr Mubiru said KCC would continue closing houses with poor
sanitation to check the spread of cholera, which has has taken root in the
city.
Kawempe division health inspector, David Katwere, attributed the cholera
outbreak in Bwaise, Karerwe, Nsooba and other slums to the practice of
emptying pit latrines in flooded water channels during the rainy season.

Two cholera victims were flown in from Sudan yesterday, 12 Dec 2006. The
Ugandan women were employed in Sudan. Josephine Muwanguzi, a nurse at the
cholera camp at Mulago Hospital, said a test confirmed they had cholera.
However, one of them was discharged in the morning. The resident of Ntinda,
a city suburb, said she worked as a bar attendant in a hotel. "I have been
working for Civicon Oasis Hotel in Sudan for 7 months. The hotel paid for
my transport from Sudan to Kampala," Nakandi said.
She said the hotel management decided to bring her back to Uganda for
treatment when her situation became worse.
Winnie Bukenya, a senior nurse at the cholera camp, disclosed that the
number of patients had risen to 509 from 463, but the death toll remained at 5.
