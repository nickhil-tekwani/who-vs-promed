The Seneca County Health Department held its final vaccination clinic Thursday in response to the hepatitis A cases confirmed in food service workers in November 2015. The department said it now has confirmed 5 cases of hepatitis A in Seneca County, all known to be close contacts.

The most recent publicly reported case involved an employee of the Waterloo Mark's Pizzeria restaurant. People who ate cold foods from Mark's Pizzeria between 19 and 28 Nov 2015 and close personal contacts of those people are urged to get vaccinated. Close personal contacts include people living in the same household, sexual contacts and people who have shared illicit drugs.

"Individuals who may have been exposed but were unable to receive treatment, or those who choose not to receive treatment, are advised to monitor themselves for signs and symptoms of Hepatitis A infection over the next 4-6 weeks," the health department said in a press release.

Earlier in November 2015, the health department held a series of vaccination clinics after a Waterloo McDonald's employee was confirmed to have hepatitis A.

Health officials said symptoms to look for are fever, fatigue, and loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine and jaundice.

"The best way to prevent Hepatitis A is by getting vaccinated and practicing good hygiene," the health department said. "Simply washing your hands well and often can help protect you from infection with a number of viruses and bacteria. Wash after using the bathroom, before preparing food or eating, and after changing a child's diaper. In addition, do not share towels, eating utensils, toothbrushes or injection drugs."
