Gwanda has been hit by an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD]
following an incident where cattle in the area mixed with buffaloes,
Newsday has learned.

The outbreak was reported on Tuesday [11 Jan 2011], leading to the
veterinary department in the Matabeleland South capital announcing a
"high surveillance" of the affected areas.

Dr Msongelwa Mangena, the provincial veterinary officer, told Newsday
the absence of fences to demarcate farms had led to domestic animals
mixing with animals such as buffaloes and getting the disease.

"The absence of boundary fences has made our work very difficult. One
beast can move from Gwanda right up to Plumtree. If it is infected,
it will mix with uninfected cattle, thereby spreading the disease,"
he said. He said the most affected areas were farms surrounding
Gwanda town, the Tuli-Magwe area, as well as Guyu.

Mangena said the veterinary department had already started
vaccinating cattle in the affected areas but said the militating
factor was the high cost involved. "It costs more than a dollar per
beast to vaccinate. Some farmers may find this a bit prohibitive," he said.

Mangena said 2 buffaloes had been spotted near the Mtshabezi River on
Sunday [9 Jan 2011]. "The problem is that buffaloes are highly
mobile, so if we get a report, by the time the hunter gets to the
area, the animals would have left. Again, the problem of boundary
fences comes into the picture because it is difficult to confine them
to one farm," he said.

Mangena said farmers should report cases of infection early so that
the department could move into the area and report once they spotted
a buffalo. He also said farmers should desist from moving cattle to
other areas without permits.

"Farmers should also inspect their cattle daily for signs that
include mouth ulcers and blisters on hooves," he said, adding that
the department hoped to have contained the disease within the next 18 months.

[The African buffalo _Syncerus caffer_ (picture at

play a significant role in the epidemiology of FMD in southern
Africa, being a long-term carrier of the FMD virus.

The most recent information ProMED-mail obtained on the FMD situation
in Zimbabwe dates back to 19 Nov 2010. Derived from the EUFMD 3rd
quarterly report for 2010, it was included in archived post
20101119.4186. The data pertaining to Zimbabwe were:

"The FMD situation following 4 outbreaks of SAT 2 between May and
June [2010], at Mangwe, Matebeleland South, is unclear. Animals are
suspected to have been in contact with previously infected animals
during a previous outbreak that occurred in September 2009 at a
feedlot in the area." See at

FMDV serotype SAT2 was identified in Zimbabwe's eastern neighbor
Mozambique during January 2011. - Mod.AS]
