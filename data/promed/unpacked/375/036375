Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) has turned up in a huge national park in
southwest England, agriculture officials said Sunday [4 Mar 2001, raising
fears it will be spread by wildlife to livestock grazing there.
Nearly 60 separate outbreaks of the highly contagious livestock disease
have been reported in Britain and Northern Ireland, and about 45 000
animals - sheep, cows and pigs - have been destroyed in an effort to stop
the spread of the ailment.
The outbreak in the Dartmoor National Park was found at a tenant farm
inside the sprawling moor in Devon, in southwest England. The National
Farmers Union called the spread of the disease to the park - where about 46
000 cattle and sheep graze - a "nightmare scenario."
Hikers and horseback riders had already been told to stay off the moor, but
the virus could easily be spread among the park's livestock herds by the
park's teeming wildlife. Many animals can carry the disease without
catching it themselves.
Since the first cases were discovered 19 Feb 2001 at a slaughterhouse in
southern England, authorities have banned exports of British milk, meat and
live animals. At outbreak sites, herds are being destroyed, with pyres of
carcasses burning around the clock.
The first suspected cases were reported in continental Europe last week,
with the discovery of blisters - one of the telltale signs - on the snouts
of 3 pigs in northern Belgium.
Authorities immediately created a buffer zone around the farm, which
specializes in British pig imports, banned horse races through the weekend,
and imposed a 3-day ban on the transport of all farm animals in Belgium. On
Saturday [3 Mar 2001, 323 pigs were destroyed.
On Sunday, authorities closed Belgium's 2 biggest zoos, in Antwerp and
Plankendael, as a precaution as they awaited full test results on the pigs,
expected Tuesday. Initial tests were negative. Petting zoos in Belgium were
closed Saturday.
The livestock ailment, which poses no danger to humans, has already dealt a
heavy blow to British farmers, and could do the same to their counterparts
elsewhere in Europe if the outbreak spreads.
It is extremely difficult to contain an outbreak of FMD, which infects
cloven-hoofed animals like sheep, cows and pigs. The virus can be carried
for miles by the wind, people, clothes or cars, surviving for lengthy
periods on boots and clothing. It can also be spread by contaminated hay,
water and manure.
The outbreak has triggered cancellations of scores of sporting events and
other large gatherings. Hundreds of parks, zoos, nature preserves and
countryside trails in Britain have been closed.
