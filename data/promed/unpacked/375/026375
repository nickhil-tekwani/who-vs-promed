The outbreak: 4 cases of invasive meningococcal disease were reported
between 22 and 24 Mar 2006 in newly recruited soldiers in Skwierzyna in
Lubuskie, a western province of Poland. Two soldiers had been referred to a
physician on 21 Mar 2006 with influenza-like symptoms, and one of them had
consulted a physician in a local hospital but was not admitted to hospital
for treatment. On 22 Mar 2006, both soldiers had sudden onset of petechial
rash, general discomfort and fever.
They were immediately admitted to the intensive care unit of the regional
hospital in Gorzow Wielkopolski. A 3rd soldier had similar symptoms of
malaise and signs of meningeal irritation on 23 Mar 2006. He was admitted
to the local hospital for observation, where he developed a petechial rash.
A 4th soldier developed pharyngitis on 23 Mar 2006 and was also admitted to
the local hospital for observation, where he developed severe headache and
vomiting on 24 Mar 2006. Both soldiers were admitted to the intensive care
unit in Gorzow Wielkopolski immediately after symptom onset.
Preliminary investigation of blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples at the
National Reference Center for Bacterial Meningitis revealed that all cases
were caused by _Neisseria meningitidis_ serotype C.
Further investigations: An investigation was begun, led by epidemiologists
at the Wojewodzki Osrodek Medycyny Prewencyjnej (Military Preventive
Medicine Center) in Wroclaw. The laboratory facilities of 3 military
centers (Wroclaw, Bydgoszcz and Krakow) and the provincial
Sanitary-Epidemiological Station in Gorzow Wielkopolski were used for this
investigation. All 4 soldiers had recently been recruited to this army unit
and had lived in the army barracks for 14 days. If the sub-unit living in
the barrack is considered as the exposed group, the overall attack rate was
4/250 (1.6 percent). The affected soldiers lived in 4 different rooms on
the same corridor (Table 1). [For Tables, see original URL. - Mod.LL]
Investigation of throat swabs collected from close contacts (roommates,
n=61) between 23 and 27 Mar 2006 revealed that 6 were carriers of _N.
meningitidis_ serotype C. Molecular typing indicated that strains collected
from all 4 cases and 6 contacts were identical (serogroup C, clonal type
ST11/ET37, serotype PFGE A2) and were identical to a strain isolated in
2005 from a soldier residing in the same army unit. Samples collected from
all other residents of the Skwierzyna Army Unit (n=1300) revealed different
_N. meningitidis_ strains.
Control measures: The affected army sub-unit was quarantined from 24 Mar
until 4 Apr 2006, and all soldiers of this sub-unit (n=250) received
prophylactic treatment of 500 mg of ciprofloxacin. After confirmation of
the bacterial strain causing the outbreak, prophylactic treatment was
extended to all residents of the unit, including civil personnel (n=1300).
Movement of soldiers within and outside the army unit was restricted
between 21 Mar and 4 Apr 2006. All staff members in the intensive care unit
in Gorzow Wielkopolski were given rifampin as prophylactic treatment.
Discussion: Invasive meningococcal disease is an acute bacterial disease,
characterized by early onset of symptoms of meningitis, septicemia and/or
other syndromes, and a moderate to high case-fatality rate (1). In recent
years, the incidence of meningococcal disease has been decreasing in
Poland, but the proportion of cases caused by group C strains has been
increasing (Table 2) [for Table, see original URL. - Mod.LL], causing
small-scale outbreaks each year (2). The incidence of meningococcal disease
is underestimated in Poland.
Surveillance of the disease was implemented in the 1970s and was based on
passive reporting of diagnosed cases by physicians to local health
departments. Up to 2004, only neuroinfection cases were reported. Since
2004, it has been mandatory to report all cases of meningococcal disease.
Meningococcal vaccine is recommended for children over 2 months of age, and
for all people without a spleen, but is not available free of charge.
According to recent official data, fewer than 2000 doses of meningococcal
vaccine have been administered each year.
Meningococcal vaccine uptake is low compared with other vaccines which are
also not usually available free of charge, such as _Hemophilus influenzae_
b (given to 7 percent of children under 4 years in 2004) influenza (over
1.3 million doses given to people of all ages in 2004), streptococcal
vaccine (given to 6658 people in 2005) and chickenpox vaccine (given to
4452 people in 2005). Poland's routine childhood immunization schedule can
be seen at the World Health Organization's Centralized Information System
for Infectious Diseases (CISID) website
<http://data.euro.who.int/cisid/>.
The outbreak described here was extensively reported in the Polish media,
making the investigation and implementation of control measures very
difficult. All 4 patients were severely ill with fulminant septicemia (3
cases) or meningitis (1 case), but there were no deaths. The index patient
is still in intensive care, and a rehabilitation of several months is foreseen.
Since this is not the 1st outbreak of invasive meningococcal disease among
newly recruited soldiers in Poland, a discussion of how to protect this
population group has begun at the national level, expressing a need to
better monitor their health status and adopt procedures for immediate
prophylaxis and treatment. Other countries, such as the United Kingdom,
have introduced vaccination against meningococcal disease after
establishing that armed forces recruits had a significantly increased risk
of disease when compared with age- matched civilian counterparts (4).

Meningococcal vaccination for serotypes A, C, Y, and W-135 is recommended
in the US and UK for American military basic trainees as well as other
high-risk groups. The vaccine that has been utilized starting with US
licensure in 1978 is an unconjugated one, but a conjugated one using the
same serotypes became licensed in the US in January 2005. The development
of a vaccine against serogroup B poses the biggest problem due to the
similarity between the B capsular polysaccharide structure and a polysialic
acid containing glycopeptides that are a part of human brain tissue; this
similarity induces immunogenic tolerance to the B capsular coat. Outer
membrane protein vaccines are being studied for serotype B prevention.
A vaccination program for military recruits in Poland could reduce more
cases than prophylaxis and treatment programs. As discussed in the posting,
vaccination rates are quite low, as seen by a 7 percent immunization
percentage for _H. influenzae_ type b. Universal immunization is difficult
to achieve if the vaccines are not given free of charge. - Mod.LL]
