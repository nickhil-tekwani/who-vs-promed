[In relation to the recent posting on the differences between this severe
epidemic and previous RVF epidemics, the following comments might provide
members with a feel of some of the field realities. - Mod.MHJ
> From our correspondent in Kenya
Here's an interesting fact -- tell me if you have seen this: I have been
surprised at the number of carcasses of livestock that are left virtually
untouched to rot in situ. I mentioned this at one of the villages, and the
elder said that the hyenas and the vultures won't eat them ... anyway,
today, I was doing some planning with the MSF-Belgium people, and they sent
a sanitation/engineer up to Garissa to work with us. I mentioned this in
passing while we were discussing the disposal of the animal carcasses, and
he said that it was funny that in the last Ebola cleanup he did last year,
he noticed that the monkey carcasses were not eaten [scavenged either.
Blue tongue has been identified from some of the sheep samples sent to Vet
Labs in Kabete. I saw the most unusual presentations in a couple of camel
herds ... complete ballooning of the head and upper neck only, death by
asphyxia, eyes very swollen, and huge mucoid membranous sloughs in mouth
covering some nasty ulcers. No foot involvement. From what the DVO says, he
and the vets who work with him have never seen anything like this ... It is
a virus soup out there!
