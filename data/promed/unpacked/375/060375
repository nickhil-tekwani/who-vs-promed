A Quebec duck farm says it has detected a case of avian flu in one of its breeding facilities.

Brome Lake Ducks says in a news release that the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain of avian influenza was confirmed Tuesday [12 Apr 2022] on a farm in St-Claude, about 160 kilometres [99.4 mi] east of Montreal.

The company says it has quarantined the farm as well as another facility in Knowlton, Que., and is working with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency to put biosecurity measures in place.

Quebec's 1st bird flu cases were detected in 3 wild geese earlier this month [April 2022], and several other provinces have already reported outbreaks in wild and domestic populations.

While most forms of avian flu are mild, H5N1 can cause serious disease and death in birds.

No human cases have been detected in Canada, and the CFIA says avian influenza is not a significant public health concern for healthy people who are not in regular contact with infected birds.

State and federal agriculture authorities announced Wednesday [13 Apr 2022] Nebraska's 6th case of avian flu had been found on a hen farm in Dixon County.

The case was found among a flock of 1.7 million egg-laying hens in a northeast Nebraska county which are now in the process of being killed, according to a release from the Nebraska and U.S. Departments of Agriculture (NDA and USDA) as well as the Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). It's the largest flock in the state that has been impacted by highly pathogenic avian influenza, also known as HPAI.

With the latest report, HPAI cases around the state have now caused the killing of about 2.7 million birds, including about 970 000 broiler chickens in Butler County, and dozens of other chickens or waterfowl in Merrick, Holt, and Scotts Bluff counties.

Millions of birds have also been killed in Iowa in recent months because of bird flu cases found there. Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium has also taken precautions to protect its bird populations.

Per USDA policy, NDA is also establishing a 6.2-mile [10 km] control zone around the Dixon County hen farm.

HPAI is a highly contagious virus among birds spreading through nasal and eye secretions as well as manure, or through contact with contaminated equipment, clothing, or shoes -- from flock to flock. The virus can be also transmitted through wild birds without them becoming sick.

State Veterinarian Dr. Roger Dudley also said in Wednesday's release [13 Apr 2022] the authorities had lifted surveillance procedures in Merrick and Holt counties, and the control zone in Butler County as well.

State agricultural authorities encourage anyone who sees signs of bird flu to call them or contact the USDA, or reach out to your local veterinarian.

Signs of HPAI in poultry include sudden death, decreased water consumption, lack of energy and appetite, decreased or odd egg production, signs of a "cold," incoordination, or diarrhea.

[3] Indiana (Elkhart County): commercial ducks

Avian influenza has been found at a 2nd duck farm in northern Indiana, the State Board of Animal Health (IBOAH) said Tuesday [12 Apr 2022].

It's the 8th commercial flock of birds in Indiana to be affected by bird flu in 2022.

The state had reported Thursday [7 Apr 2022] a commercial duck farm in Elkhart County tested positive for the H5N1 avian flu virus. The 2nd farm was found Tuesday [12 Apr 2022], also in Elkhart County. Both flocks have more than 10 000 ducks. The state did not identify the farms.

The Indiana Board of Animal Health has begun testing 78 commercial bird flocks around the duck farm where the bird flu was first found in an effort to confirm if the virus has spread.

The board also has reached out to 320 backyard poultry owners and people who raise birds as a hobby near the Elkhart County farm where bird flu was first found to conduct testing for them at no charge. People can schedule testing by calling the IBOAH.

The Indiana Department of Agriculture says the state ranks No. 1 in commercial duck production.

In February and March [2022], I-Team 8 reported avian flu was found in 6 Indiana turkey farms. At least 171 000 turkeys were euthanized to control the virus, the state said. All 6 turkey farms have had controls lifted since.

The Indiana State Board of Animal Health is keeping people updated on its website.

Indiana isn't the only state seeing flocks contracting avian flu. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is keeping a database of outbreaks. Some zoos have changed how their birds are displayed to protect against the virus.

Officials emphasize bird flu doesn't jeopardize the safety of meat or eggs or represent a significant risk to human health. No infected birds are allowed into the food supply, and properly cooking poultry and eggs kills bacteria and viruses. No human cases have been found in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

[4] Idaho (Gooding & Caribou Counties): chickens

The Idaho State Department of Agriculture has received confirmation of multiple cases of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) virus in 2 separate flocks of domestic chickens in Gooding County and Caribou County. Officials say the affected flocks appear to be unrelated.

HPAI is a viral disease and requires rapid response because it is highly contagious and often fatal to chickens. Idaho officials are working with the U.S. Department of Agriculture to respond to cases. The public is encouraged to check the ISDA website for updates, including affected counties and number of cases.

It is uncommon for humans to become infected with avian influenzas, but symptoms may include conjunctivitis, fever, lethargy, aches, coughing, or diarrhea. Being in direct contact with domestic birds is the highest risk activity. When USDA guidelines for cooking are followed, HPAI is not a foodborne illness.

HPAI is carried by waterfowl (geese and ducks) along their migratory path. Idaho is within the Pacific Flyway. Domestic birds and poultry are very susceptible to morbidity and mortality once infected, say officials. HPAI is transmitted between birds through close contact, fecal matter, and sometimes as an aerosol. It is often carried on objects such as tools, vehicles, clothes, and boots, which can transfer the virus from one location to another.

With fair season approaching, ISDA has developed guidance for organizers of poultry exhibitions and exhibitors. These materials can be found on the ISDA website at https://agri.idaho.gov/main/animals/avian-species/avian-disease/avian-influenza-resources/.

[5] Michigan (Livingston County): backyard poultry

Avian influenza has been confirmed in a backyard poultry flock in Livingston County, the state Department of Agriculture and Rural Development said Friday [15 Apr 2022], bringing to 4 the number of southeastern Michigan counties where the virus has been detected.

The premise where the bird flu was found is under quarantine and the birds have been destroyed to prevent further spread of the virus, the department said. The flock contained about 20 birds of multiple species, it said.

The finding underscores the "ongoing high risk for the disease in Michigan," the department said in urging poultry owners "to implement every strategy necessary to protect their flocks."

Bird flu can spread in various ways, including by wild birds, through contact with infected poultry, by equipment, and on the clothing and shoes of caretakers, the department said.

"We are strongly encouraging all flock owners to take steps to better protect their poultry and help reduce the spread of this disease. Now is the time for action," State Veterinarian Dr. Nora Wineland said.

The department recommends preventing contact between domestic and wild birds by bringing them indoors or ensuring their outdoor area is fully enclosed, washing hands and disinfecting gear before and after handling birds and when moving between different coops.

It also recommends keeping poultry feed secure to ensure no contact between the feed/feed ingredients and wild birds or rodents.

[Almost any type of fowl, from chickens to ducks, geese, privately owned or commercially raised domestic birds are at risk for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). HPAI is spread by wild birds who seldom display any signs of illness but our domestic birds have no immunity to this pathogen. Consequently, the virus is devastating to your commercial, backyard, and pet birds.

Extreme protection for your birds is recommended. Keep them inside the barns, the houses, the shelters. Be sure to provide a means of cooling for them, but be meticulous with your approach to biosecurity. Flu flies with wild birds and can just as easily walk into a facility with dirty boots or coveralls. Clean coveralls, foot coverings, hair coverings, and gloves are recommended each time you enter a facility, even if it is your own backyard chicken coop. You simply cannot be too cautious about protecting your birds. - Mod.TG]
