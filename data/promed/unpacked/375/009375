Paddy output in Haryana plummets
--------------------------------
Paddy output in Haryana fell almost 11 percent to 48 lakh [4.8
million] tonnes in the kharif season [autumn] 2008-09 as acreage
increased this year to 11.79 lakh [1.179 million] hectares [2 913 372
acres] from 10.75 lakh [1.075 million] hectares [2 656 382 acres] in
2007-08.

"Because of the attack of white backed planthopper insects and neck
blast disease in the month of October this year, the paddy crop,
mainly PUSA 1121 varieties, were adversely affected, resulting in
overall fall in output," said a senior official of Haryana
Agriculture Department.

Insects caused extensive damage to the paddy crop in several growing
areas such as Rohtak, Jhajjar, Karnal, Sonepat and Panipat. "Because
of the substantial damage to the paddy, the rice production of
Haryana has dipped. Moreover, the yield of crop per hectare has also
plummeted," he said.

[Rice blast is caused by the fungus _Magnaporthe grisea_ (synonyms
_Pyricularia grisea_, _P. oryzae_) with potential yield losses of
more than 50 percent. The fungus can affect leaves, neck, collar and
nodes. Spread occurs with infected plant material, by mechanical
means, water, and wind. Disease management may include fungicides and
cultural practices, but relies mainly on resistant varieties.
However, the fungus is highly variable and this favours the emergence
of new strains with increased virulence. For more information on rice
blast see links and previous posts below.

The white backed planthopper (_Sogatella furcifera_) is a serious
pest of rice. While it acts as a vector for at least 2 viruses of
grassy hosts (_Pangola stunt virus_, _Echinochloa ragged stunt
virus_), these do not include major pathogens of rice.
