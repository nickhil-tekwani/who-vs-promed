A man died on Fri 28 Jun [2019] at Guwahati's Nemcare hospital where he had been undergoing treatment for Japanese encephalitis for the past 8 days. He was a resident of Guwahati's Birkuchi area.

It should be noted that this is the 1st death reported in the city due to the brain infection this year [2019]. However, across Assam, 10 people have died because of the disease so far, and 35 more are infected with it.

[Although most of the recent cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) and acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) have been reported from Bijar state so far this year [2019], Assam state is also endemic for JE.

This is the busy Japanese encephalitis virus transmission season in northeastern India, including Assam state. The report above uses the term "Japanese encephalitis" without mentioning "acute encephalitis syndrome" that has been used in previous reports from Assam. Where laboratory confirmation is available, usually these encephalitis cases are attributed to Japanese encephalitis (JE) as a minority of cases, with acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) of unspecified etiology for the majority. This is the season for JE virus, but AES also occurs at this time. As noted in many earlier posts, the determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive.

Vaccination for JE was carried out in the affected areas last year (2018). It is not mentioned whether vaccination was carried out again this year (2019). The type of JE vaccine used previously is not mentioned. If it is an inactivated vaccine, the duration of immunity may not be long-lasting. Attenuated live vaccine would provide longer immunity. - Mod.TY
