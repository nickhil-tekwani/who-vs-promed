Future Reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[Sheep and Goat Pox is comparatively common in the surrounding region with the following countries reporting the disease to OIE WAHID database since 2008: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, China, India, Iran,Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. Additionally, some of these countries are reporting outbreaks in large numbers ranging from dozens per year to hundreds. This is the first time Kyrgyzstan has reported quantitative data but one suspects they may not have been reporting events previously.

The clinical description in this report indicates smallpox rashes which is a confusing term, at best, because smallpox only exists in two laboratories in the world and would be an extremely unlikely candidate as the cause of the pox rashes reported in this OIE report.

The generalized and typical pox lesions described here were almost certainly caused by a caprivirus, not the smallpox virus associated with human disease. Both sheep pox and goat pox are viral diseases of sheep and goats characterised by fever, generalised papules or nodules, vesicles (rarely), internal lesions (particularly in the lungs), and death. Both diseases are caused by strains of capripoxvirus, all of which can infect sheep and goats but not humans.
