[1] Pakistan (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa), 2 new cases

Two new cases of polio virus have been reported in northwest Pakistan, an official said on Tuesday [23 Apr 2019].

With the new cases, reported in Bannu and North Waziristan districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, the total number of reported polio cases in the country has risen to 8 since the beginning of this year [2019].

Six polio cases were reported in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and tribal districts, while one case was reported each in Punjab and Sindh provinces.

"Only anti-polio vaccination could protect children from [this] crippling virus, and people should vaccinate their children in every campaign to attain full immunity against the virus," Babar Atta, head of polio eradication program of Pakistan, told Anadolu Agency.

Pakistan is among 3 countries in the world, including Afghanistan and Nigeria, where polio virus still exists, and the country remains under a polio-linked travel restriction imposed by the World Health Organization (WHO).

In 2014, the WHO made it mandatory for all people traveling from Pakistan to carry a polio vaccination certificate.

Armed assailants belonging to militant groups have frequently targeted polio vaccinators and their security detail in several parts of Pakistan. The groups see the anti-polio campaigns as part of an elaborate anti-Muslim and Western conspiracy, and often issue death threats to vaccinators, many of whom are women, for administrating the vital vaccines to children.

According to Pakistani officials, around 88 people associated with the drive have been killed across Pakistan since December 2012. [See the media report in section [2] just below this for the latest incident. - Mod.MPP]

[According to the Stop Polio Pakistan website, the 6 cases reported from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province are split between districts in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (3 cases) and districts in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Tribal Districts (3 cases) (see http://www.endpolio.com.pk/polioin-pakistan/polio-cases-in-provinces), with the most recent date of onset 9 Mar 2019 (see http://www.endpolio.com.pk/polioin-pakistan/polio-cases-district-wise-2019).

Reading the media reports in the remainder of this post, one can understand why Pakistan is significantly challenged in meeting the goal of polio eradication. (See my comments further down in this post.)

[2] Pakistan (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa), violence

Pakistani police say gunmen have killed a policeman assigned to escort polio workers during a 3-day nationwide campaign against the crippling disease.

Local police officer Wahid Noor says Tuesday's [23 Apr 2019] attack took place in the northwestern town of Bannu.

The incident took place a day after parents rushed hundreds of school children to hospitals in the northwestern city of Peshawar, claiming their children complained of nausea and vomiting after being given polio vaccinations.

According to Shaukat Yousafzai, a government spokesman in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, their investigations show no student suffered illness because of a reaction to the vaccine.

He said panic gripped the province Monday [22 Apr 2019] when a rumor spread there that scores of children are not feeling well after taking polio drops. He said a man who initiated this rumor has been arrested.

[3] Pakistan (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa), 2nd violence episode

Gunmen in Pakistan shot and killed a police officer guarding a polio immunization team on Wednesday [24 Apr 2019], the latest attack on efforts to protect children from the crippling and sometimes deadly disease.

Polio workers are often targets in Pakistan, where hardline clerics and Islamist militants have claimed the government's polio eradication campaign is a foreign ploy to sterilize Muslim children or a cover for Western spies.

The police constable was on duty with a polio team in the remote Buner district in northern Pakistan when unknown gunmen opened fire, police chief Irshad Khan Yousafzai said.

"He was shot in the head and shoulder and died immediately," he said, adding that officers had been assigned to polio teams in the district after a rise in threats against workers.

Pakistan is one of the only 3 countries, along with Afghanistan and Nigeria, that suffers from endemic polio, a childhood virus that can cause paralysis or death.

The polio eradication campaign has had success with an intense program based around vaccinating vulnerable children. Only 4 polio cases have been reported since January [2019] [6 cases have been reported in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa since 1 Jan 2019, and one each were reported from Punjab and Sindh. - Mod.MPP].

However, suspicion of immunization drives threatens to undermine the government campaign.

A dozen people were arrested in northern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province this week [week of Mon 22 Apr 2019], accused of organizing a campaign against polio vaccination and setting fire to public health facilities in the provincial capital Peshawar, the health minister said.

Hisham Inamullah Khan blamed "fake and malicious propaganda" for 44 000 children taken to provincial hospitals by parents fearing they had received bad polio vaccine, which, he said was "obviously was not true."

On Tuesday [23 Apr 2019], a polio worker was stabbed in the eastern city of Lahore after a heated argument with residents of an apartment building, police said.

That same day, a police officer was shot and killed by unknown assailants while on his way to join a polio team in the northwestern district of Bannu, police said.

[4] Pakistan - fake news re: campaign

Anti-polio panic (editorial):
Pandemonium gripped KP amidst a province-wide polio eradication drive, threatening to stop this critical campaign in its tracks, which was ultimately the agenda of those who instigated the mass hysteria.

Thousands of children were rushed to hospitals by their panic-stricken parents on Monday [22 Apr 2019] after malicious rumours of adverse reactions to the oral polio vaccine [OPV] were disseminated over community and mosque loudspeakers, and via WhatsApp and other social media platforms, and picked up and reported, uncritically and without verification, by sections of the mainstream media.

The fake news was soon exposed as a total, willful fabrication in footage that soon emerged, but disinformation had already been spread, precisely because it fed into misconceptions about the OPV that have persisted despite the best efforts of public officials to dispel religious and medical concerns.

And though public officials scrambled to calm the public, holding a press conference within hours of the emergent crisis, by then, far too much damage had already been done.

In Mashokhel, where the rumour mill apparently originated, the local health unit was torched by rioters, and across the province, streets and hospitals were overwhelmed by a terrified public.

In the days ahead, there may be severe short- and long-term repercussions. Only yesterday [Tue 23 Apr 2019; see [2] above] [and today, Wed 24 Apr 2019; see [3] above], a police ASI assigned to a polio team was killed on his way to report for duty, and 2 new cases of the polio virus were detected in the province.

That a few malevolent individuals could hijack the vaccination drive, thus undermining the effort, dedication, and courage of polio workers, is proof of how tentative the gains have been in building public confidence in vaccinations.

There are already doubts about the extent of coverage this polio drive is able to achieve in the face of what has transpired.

The government must now examine measures to anticipate the possibility of fake news proliferating via social media, which can spread like wildfire in the absence of basic digital literacy among the masses.

The mainstream media, however, should have known better. For years, it has reported on the lives lost -- children who succumbed to the virus, and workers to the attacks of obscurantist elements -- and the disease burden on the country.

There must be a wholesale adoption of strict coverage protocols recognising the sensitivity, fragility, and security concerns of the anti-polio campaign. This is a dire setback, but it must not be allowed to derail the fight to eradicate this crippling, deadly disease once and for all.

[Reading the media reports above is very disheartening, to say the least. It is beyond my comprehension how people can direct their political "activism" into anarchy that endangers the lives of innocent children. Creating fake news stories to scare people away from vaccination campaigns and directing violent acts on people involved in vaccination campaigns is more than I am able to understand. And this occurred in close temporal proximity to the senseless killing of a WHO consultant doctor working on the Ebola outbreak in Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. Another media report mentions the Taliban has not permitted the vaccination activities in parts of Afghanistan (see https://www.voanews.com/a/official-taliban-is-deprive-1m-afghan-children-of-polio-vaccine/4882669.html). What has happened to this world?
