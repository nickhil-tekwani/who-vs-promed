A total of 14 Parisian worshippers were poisoned on [Mon 14 Dec 2015] after their synagogue's electronic lock was daubed with poison.

Members of the Jewish community of Bonneuil-sur-Marne, in the southeastern suburbs of Paris, called emergency services to report a sudden strong burning sensation in their eyes and itchy rashes on their skin.

It is believed 25 firemen rushed to the synagogue, where they treated congregants and traced their condition to the daubed lock.

The substance was described as a "nonlethal irritant" and was sent to a police forensic lab for analysis.

The shul [Yiddish word for synagogue], which is under police and military protection when open, is believed to have been targeted when closed with no guard present.

[While this was fortunately not lethal, it nevertheless is a huge threat to realize the toxic agent is transmitted to 14 individuals through a door handle.

There is obviously some "sticking" agent or something to make the toxic agent stick to the skin, yet without the entire amount of the agent affecting only one person.

It may be something on the order of an acid, or alkali, but the lab results have not been released. ProMED-mail would be interested in receiving information about those results. - Mod.TG
