A strain of bird flu, also known as avian influenza, was discovered [Mon 5 Dec 2016] at Moshav Be'er Tuvia and Kibbutz Revadim, just East of Ashdod [HaDarom/Southern district].

At the same time, teams from the Agriculture and Rural Development Ministry have been working since yesterday [Sun 4 Dec 2016] at the henhouse in Kibbutz Ein Tzurim in Gush Etzion [HaDarom/Southern district] to eradicate the flu that was discovered there. Ministry inspectors continue actively monitor the area.

As part of the monitoring, samples have been taken from chicken coops within a radius of 10 kilometers [6.2 mi] from the affected farm.

The Ministry is also encouraging those who raise poultry or ornamental birds in the area to keep the birds inside for now to reduce the risk of infection from wild birds.

The Veterinary Institute [Kimron Veterinary Institute, Beit-Dagan] is reporting that the subspecies of virus in the recent outbreak is identical to the subspecies that was discovered recently in several European countries. It was spotted in Israel for the 1st time 2 weeks ago at Kibbutz Heftsiba, in the North, between Afula and Beit She'an.

The finding reinforces the theory that migrating birds passing over Israel at this time from Eastern Europe and Asia are responsible for bringing the disease to Israel.

Agriculture Ministry officials have emphasized that it is safe to continue consuming poultry and eggs, but are encouraging people to only buy eggs that are sold in completely enclosed cartons or plastic and to consume them only after proper cooking.

An outbreak of HPAI H5N8 has been diagnosed today [Sun 4 Dec 2016] in a turkey farm in the Kibbutz Ein Tzurim [HaDarom/Southern district], affecting a 10-week-old turkey flock of 30 000 birds. Adjacent to it, there is a 4-week-old turkey flock with 15 000 birds.

Further to the information on HPAI H5N8 outbreak in Ein Tzurim, the Veterinary Services have diagnosed 2 additional foci of the disease. One, in a broiler breeder flock (15 000 birds) in Beer Tuvia and the other one in a turkey flock in Kibbutz Revadim (11 000 males, 10 weeks old) [HaDarom/Southern district]. The recent events are located in one of the most densely populated poultry regions in Israel, characterised by the diversity of the branches. Additional outbreaks in the area should not surprise.

The virus is, most probably, introduced by migrating birds from Asia/Eastern Europe. The virus has recently been detected also in Egypt (wild birds), Iran, and Tunisia and has been speedily spreading in several European countries.

[We are indebted to Drs Elkin and Shamir for bringing the information to our attention.

Israel applies stamping-out policy addressing HPAI in poultry; compensations are paid as prescribed in the Animal Disease Ordinance and its regulations.

The numbers and diversity of migrating birds flying over Israel is one of the global highest; avian influenza surveillance among them, yet to be applied, could be helpful in the international epidemiological studies of the disease.

Detected in early June 2016 in wild birds in Tyva (Russian Federation), HPAI H5N8 has been reported since mid-October 2016 in several species of wild or domestic birds in Southern Asia (India), in 13 countries in Europe (Hungary, Poland, Croatia, Austria, Germany, Switzerland, The Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Russia, Finland, Romania, France), in 3 countries in the Middle East (Israel, Iran, and Egypt), and suspected in migratory birds in the Maghreb (Tunisia, final serotyping pending). With winter and cold weather approaching in many regions of Europe, South Asia and Northern Africa, more countries are expected to have virus incursions over the next few weeks and months as it moves along migratory flyways. - Mod.AS
