Pakistan
- 5 WPV1 cases were reported in the past week: 3 from Bannu district and 1 from Charsadda district, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, and 1 from South Waziristan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. All cases had onset of paralysis in July 2019. There are 53 WPV1 cases in 2019, and 12 WPV1 cases were reported in 2018. [These cases were reported in Poliomyelitis update (66): Pakistan (KP) 20190807.6610623 - Mod.MPP]
- 5 WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week: 1 each from Lahore, Multan, and Faisalabad districts, Punjab province; 1 from Landhi Town, Karachi district, Sindh province; and 1 from Quetta district, Balochistan province. The samples were collected between [17 and 20 Jul 2019].

Nigeria, Lake Chad and West Africa
Nigeria
- 2 cases of cVDPV2 were reported in the past week: 1 each from Ankpa and Ibaji districts, Kogi State. The onsets of paralysis were on [13 and 20 Jun 2019]. There are 16 cVDPV2 cases reported in 2019. There were 34 cVDPV2 cases in 2018.
- 1 cVDPV2-positive environmental sample was reported in the past week from Ilorin East, Kwara State. The sample was collected on [13 Jul 2019].

Lake Chad
- No case of cVDPV2 has been reported in the past week.
- In the Lake Chad region, cVDPV2 linked to the outbreak originating in Nigeria has been detected in Niger (1 case in 2019 and 10 cases in 2018), and Cameroon (1 positive environmental sample, collected on [20 Apr 2019] in Extreme Nord).
The risk of further cVDPV2 spread across the Lake Chad subregion remains high.

West Africa: Benin and Ghana
- 1 cVDPV2 case was reported in the past week in Benin in Kalale district, Borgou State, with onset of paralysis on [7 Jul 2019] outbreak in Nigeria [??? -- perhaps this sentence referred to the virus being genetically related to an outbreak in Nigeria. - Mod.MPP]. This is the 1st-ever cVDPV case reported in Benin.
- No cVDPV2-positive environmental sample was reported in the past week. One cVDPV2-positive environmental [case] had previously been reported from Ghana, linked to virus circulating in Nigeria.
- Surveillance is being strengthened in neighbouring Togo, Cote d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso.
- The risk of further cVDPV2 spread across West Africa remains high.

Central Africa
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
- 2 cases of cVDPV2 have been reported this week: 1 each from Mukanga and Wembo-Nyama districts in Haut Lomami and Sankuru provinces, respectively. There are 17 reported cases of cVDPV2 in 2019. There were 20 cVDPV2 cases reported in 2018. The DRC is currently affected by 9 separate cVDPV2 outbreaks: 1 each originated in Haut Katanga, Mongala, Sankuru, Tanganika, Tshopo, Kasai, Kasai Central, and 2 in Haut Lomami provinces.

Angola
- 2 cases of cVDPV2 have been reported this week in Zacaria Amando and Xa Muteba districts, Lunda Norte State. The onsets of paralysis were on 1 and 21 Jun 2019. There are a total of 5 cVDPV2 cases from 3 outbreaks reported in 2019.

Central African Republic (CAR)
- There are 4 reported cases from 4 different outbreaks of cVDPV2 in 2019. Additional confirmed cVDPV2 community contacts have been reported in CAR.
- No environmental samples were reported.

Horn of Africa
- No case of cVDPV2 has been reported in the past week.
- Somalia has reported a total of 15 cVDPV cases (8 type 2, 6 type 3 and 1 coinfection of both type 2 and type 3) since the beginning of the outbreaks. The most recent cVDPV3 virus was from an AFP case from Runingod district, Middle Shabelle province with an onset date of paralysis on [7 Sep 2018]. cVDPV2 has also been detected during 2018 in one environmental sample in Kenya collected on [21 Mar 2018]. There is also one reported case of cVDPV2 in Ethiopia, linked to Somalia, with onset on 20 May 2019.

Papua New Guinea
- No new cases of cVDPV1 were reported this week. There were 26 cases reported in 2018.

Mozambique
- No case of cVDPV2 outbreak has been reported this week. There was one case reported in 2018.

- This outbreak is not linked to the cVDPV1 in neighbouring Papua New Guinea.

Iran
- No new WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week. In total, 3 WPV1-positive environmental samples have been reported in 2019, all from Sistan and Balochistan province. The isolated viruses have been detected in environmental samples only, and genetic sequencing confirms they are linked to WPV1 circulating in Karachi, Pakistan.

China
- No cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in the country remains one.

[The list of countries demonstrating poliovirus circulation (WPV or cVDPV) in the past 2 months through isolation of the virus from cases of AFP (acute flaccid paralysis), from healthy community contacts of cases of AFP, or from environmental sampling keeps growing, with Benin joining the list of countries with cVDPVs.

It is unclear whether there have been 15 or 16 cases reported from Nigeria during 2019, albeit the grand total of 51 cVDPV cases reported during 2019 is consistent with 16 total cases reported from Nigeria. Also it is unclear if the genetic studies of the cVDPV2 identified in Benin is related to one of the outbreaks ongoing in Nigeria.

If one looks at a map of Africa, one is struck by the current "clusters" of countries reporting cVDPVs. In West Africa, Nigeria has 2 or 3 independent outbreaks of cVDPV2, and all 3 neighboring countries sharing a border with Nigeria (Benin, Cameroon and Niger) plus Ghana (which is on the western side of Togo, which shares its eastern border with Benin) have reported cases. Then there is the DRC, which shares borders with the Central African Republic (which also shares a border with Cameroon) and Angola. The next cluster is in Eastern Africa with Somalia sharing borders with Kenya and Ethiopia. The isolated country as yet not clustered with other countries is Mozambique. A major concern are the other countries making up Western, Central and Eastern Africa that have not as yet reported cases, including those in the Lake Chad region, where vaccination coverages are suboptimal. A question that remains unanswered is whether the use of the mOPV2 (monovalent type 2 oral polio vaccine) is the way to permanently interrupt cVDPV2 transmission in an area with challenges in routine vaccination coverages or whether its use (and subsequent flooding such an area with the OPV2 virus) creates a vicious circle.

As done in previous posts, to visualize all of this activity, I am putting links to HealthMap/ProMED-mail maps of countries with poliovirus activity during the past 12 months below. The size of the list remains impressive now with 19 countries -- 12 in Africa, 5 in Asia, and 2 in the Western Pacific.
