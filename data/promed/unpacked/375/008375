Biologists in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park have a mystery on
their hands. Something is killing snapping turtles at Cades Cove, and 44
turtles have turned up dead in the past 2 months. Biologists are looking
closely at a microscopic organism previously unknown in reptiles but have
not ruled anything out, other than cold weather or a predator.
"I am not ashamed to say we don't know what's going on right now," said
Wastewater treatment operator Ron Click first began noticing the dead
animals in December 2002 around wastewater treatment ponds at Cades Cove
campground and developed areas. "To see what may be all of the turtles in
one pond dying within a few weeks of each other is an extremely unusual
event," said Grace
McLaughlin, wildlife disease specialist with the National Wildlife Health
Center in Wisconsin.
Keith Langdon, park supervisory biologist, said dead turtles have been found
only in that area. But park officials want visitors to be on the lookout for
wildlife "die-offs." The dead turtles in the Smokies have been both male
and female and all sizes. Park staff members captured one dying turtle and
have sent the carcass to the National Wildlife Health Center. The center
discovered the presence of a microorganism found in birds. Ben Cash,
ecologist and assistant professor of biology at Maryville College in
Maryville, Tennessee, said he does not believe the parasite has been found
in reptiles before. It can be fatal. "It is a potential player," Cash said.
The dead turtle had elevated levels of iron in its liver. McLaughlin said
the turtle examined at the Wildlife Health Center had no fat reserves and
was "very, very anemic."

Dr. Mark Mitchell from LSU School of Veterinary Medicine, Baton Rouge, LA
has tested a variety of wild chelonian species originating from West Nile
virus-positive areas in Louisiana. These animals were tested for West Nile
infection and exposure by PCR and serology, respectively. Despite a rather
extensive search, they found little to no evidence of West Nile virus
infection in turtles. The results of their study were published in the 2002
proceedings of the Association of Reptilian and Amphibian Veterinarians.

I would like to clarify that our parasitologist found a rickettsia that is
similar to _Aegyptianella_, a genus that has been found in birds and frogs.
We do not know at this time if it is an _Aegyptianella_, and if so, if it is
one of the previously recognized species. We do not know if the rickettsia
is pathogenic, or if there is another disease process causing the mortality.
We are very interested in receiving information on other aquatic turtle or
amphibian mortalities in the region, and people can contact me by e-mail to
report other events.
