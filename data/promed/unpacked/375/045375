Austria has called on the European Commission to play a more active role in fighting the cattle disease lumpy skin disease [LSD]. Some Member States supported the call. They want the European Commission to take a leading role on the purchase and distribution of vaccines against the disease. This has been reported by the State Secretary for Economic Affairs, Van Dam, in a letter to the parliament in which he addressed the European Agriculture and Fisheries Council meeting of 18 Jul [2016] in Brussels.

LSD is a disease in cattle caused by a pox virus. In August 2015 the disease was established for the first time in the European Union. There are many infections in large parts of northern Greece, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Serbia, Kosovo and Albania.

The fight against LSD is compulsory under European regulations. The main measures include the culling of infected farms in conjunction with vaccination of cattle nearby. Experts from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) indicate that without preventive vaccination against LSD the measures will not be sufficiently effective, with a high risk of developing an endemic situation in Europe.

Austria and other EU countries call for new rules to allow preventive vaccination in countries or regions threatened by the disease. Changes in European health legislation are necessary to adapt the approach to the disease.

[The suggested changes in the EU animal health legislation, allowing preventive LSD vaccination, are long due. If/when applied, the selected vaccine and its supply will have to be decided upon. At present, south-eastern (Balkan) European countries use the (homologous) live-attenuated Onderstepoort (South Africa) Neethling LSD vaccine. On the other hand, the Russian Federation countries affected by LSD, and other countries in the Caucasus region, have reportedly been using another capripox vaccine strain namely the heterologous live-attenuated sheep-pox vaccine (ARRIAH vaccine strain). The application of a live capripox vaccine in countries hitherto uninfected has been subject to discussions in the past, and steps have been undertaken to try to develop a potent, safe inactivated vaccine.

During the recent EFSA workshop on LSD, held in Brussels in May 2016, some preliminary results about a LSD vaccine evaluation trial using an optimized infection model were reported by Dr Kris De Clerq from Veterinary and Agrochemical Research Centre (CODA CERVA).

The objectives of the CODA-CERVA study were twofold: i) optimize a LSDV infection model and ii) evaluate and compare LSDV live and inactivated vaccines under standardized conditions using the optimized challenge model. In order to achieve the 1st objective 2 challenge viruses were compared in vivo. Not only clinical signs were compared, but also virological parameters (viraemia and virus secretion), humoral (seroconversion) and cellular immunological (IFNg release) parameters. Although certain parameters were very similar, such as a fever spike on 7/8 dpi and seroconversion, others were quite different (clinical signs, viraemia, IFNg release). Based upon the gathered data, the most suited challenge virus for the vaccine evaluation experiments was selected. This optimized challenge model was subsequently used to compare several commercially available live attenuated (LSDV, sheep pox- and goat pox-based) vaccines and newly developed inactivated LSDV vaccines. Each vaccine group comprised of 7 animals, and 5 unvaccinated control animals were used per trial. Vaccinated and unvaccinated animals could be clearly distinguished using the different virological, humoral and cellular immunological parameters. Among the vaccinated groups, different parameter patterns could be observed pre- and post-infection, suggesting differences in safety and efficacy properties between the analyzed vaccines. Based upon these data it was possible to distinguish between unsuitable, moderately suitable and suitable vaccine candidates.

It will be useful to obtain the detailed results of the said trials, indicating the very vaccine(s) recommended in Europe at present.
