Kansas: First Confirmed Human Cases of West Nile Virus Infection
-------------------------------------------------
The Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) has confirmed 5 human
cases of West Nile virus infection. These are the first confirmed human
cases in Kansas. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
notified KDHE of 3 positive cases in Rice County, one in Shawnee County, and
one in Wyandotte County. All of the patients survived.
Rice County Cases: 29-year-old with onset of symptoms 16 Aug 2002;
58-year-old with onset of symptoms 15 Aug 2002; 72-year-old with onset of
symptoms 28 Aug 2002. Shawnee County Case: 28-year-old with onset of
symptoms 30 Aug 2002. Wyandotte County: 52-year-old with onset of symptoms
12 Aug 2002.
While the human specimens were sent to the Centers for Disease Control
several weeks ago, CDC is testing specimens from all across the U.S., and it
takes several weeks to get the results back. Therefore, it's important to
note that this is not an outbreak, because the patients were sick at
different times and in different locations.
Because it is late in the mosquito season and the weather is becoming
cooler, mosquito populations are declining, reducing the risk to humans for
mosquito-borne disease. "We are getting very close to the time of year when
mosquitos aren't a problem in Kansas: without mosquitoes, the virus doesn't
spread," Dr. Hansen noted. "We plan to continue the surveillance for West
Nile virus throughout the state. Mosquito control and protection is the best
defense against West Nile virus."
West Nile Virus has been confirmed in birds, horses, mules, or mosquito
pools in 98 counties with the newest addition of Chautauqua County. This
involved a horse and brings the total number of horses affected by West Nile
virus in Kansas to 530.
