Please note that "cuys" certainly have epidemiological importance in the
Andean countries, as they are found frequently inside houses. But they are
domesticated Cavia, a rodent, not _Didelphis marsupialis_ opossum/not
_Didelphus_, a marsupial!

[Whilst like you I was puzzled by this, especially as opossums are
nocturnal and therefore hard to find and observe their corpses, I took our
informant's information at face value as he was the person there and
transliterating the local animal names, rightly or wrongly. Domestic guinea
pigs would make a lot more epidemiological sense as sentinels and maybe as
contributors as they are a regular component of the Andean diet, and their
slaughter & preparation would have formed part of the funeral activities. -
