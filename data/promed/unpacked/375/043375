The number of victims struck down by an outbreak of legionnaires' disease
in London has doubled to 12 in less than a week, worried health officials
confirmed today, 6 Sep 2005. 12 adults have contracted the infection in the
Lewisham area of south east London in the last 8 weeks, half of them in the
last week alone.
Health experts desperately trying to track down the source of the bug have
ruled out several possible locations. However they admitted they are no
nearer to discovering the source. A spokeswoman for the Health Protection
Agency said that 6 new cases had come to light in the Lewisham area over
the weekend. She said: "Experts are carrying out tests, but each sample
will take between 5 to 6 days to grow. We have cancelled out a couple of
possibilities and there is always the chance these cases are not related.
Members of public in the area need to be aware of the symptoms of the
disease and, if in doubt, to contact their GP immediately."
A 2nd alert letter has now been issued to GPs, NHS hospitals and NHS Direct
in London and the South East advising them of the legionnaires' disease
cases, alerting them to the symptoms and asking them to notify any cases to
the South East London Health Protection Unit.
Dr Rachel Heathcock, lead Consultant in Communicable Disease Control at the
South East London Health Protection Unit, said: "We are working closely
with local environmental health officers in the boroughs of Lewisham,
Bexley and Wandsworth, Health Protection Agency Legionella specialists, and
the Health and Safety Executive to investigate all possible sources of the
infection and whether there are any links between the cases.
"We are continuing to carry out investigations to determine whether there
is a common source or sources; any recognized potential sites have been
visited and tested and where appropriate asked to carry out a precautionary
disinfection. All tests to date have proved negative. Therefore there is a
possibility we are simply seeing an increase in detection of single cases
in line with the national picture.
"If any common sources are found, immediate action will be taken to protect
public health and prevent further cases. We would like to reassure the
public that legionnaires' disease cannot be spread from person to person."
Britain's worst outbreak of legionnaires' disease, in which 7 people died
and another 172 were infected, followed an outbreak at a council-owned arts
centre in Barrow, Cumbria, during the summer of 2002.
