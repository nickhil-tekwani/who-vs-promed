Pepper leafroll virus: a new begomovirus from Peru
--------------------------------------------------
In Peru, a new begomovirus has been identified from a yellow Peruvian chilli pepper (_Capsicum baccatum_ var. _pendulum_) plant showing severe leaf curl symptoms and collected from a crop located in La Libertad department. The name Pepper leafroll virus (PepLRV) was proposed. Further studies showed that PepLRV could [also] be detected in different parts of Peru [and] from several other cultivated species, such as tomato (_Solanum lycopersicum_), bean (_Phaseolus_ species), [as well as] the weed species _Nicandra physaloides_.

Pepper chlorotic spot virus: a new tospovirus from Taiwan
---------------------------------------------------------
Since 2009, unusual symptoms resembling those of a virus disease have been observed in Taiwan on glasshouse crops of sweet pepper (_Capsicum annum_). Affected plants presented mottling and deformation on leaves and fruits. Studies have shown that the causal agent is a new tospovirus which has tentatively been called Pepper chlorotic spot virus (PCSV). Further studies are needed on to its distribution, epidemiology (eg, thrips and seed transmission) and management strategies.

Citrus vein enation virus: a new virus associated with citrus vein enation disease
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Citrus vein enation disease is a graft- and aphid-transmitted disease of citrus which is thought to be of viral etiology. Recent molecular studies (deep-sequencing) conducted in Spain have shown that a new virus belonging to the genus _Enamovirus_ and provisionally named Citrus vein enation virus (CVEV) was present in diseased plants. Specific diagnostic tools have been developed for CVEV and have been adopted within Spanish sanitation, quarantine and certification programmes.

Citrus leprosis virus cytoplasmic type 2: a new virus associated with citrus leprosis
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Citrus leprosis is an important disease of citrus in South and Central America which is associated with 2 types of virions: one found in the cytoplasm (_Citrus leprosis virus_ cytoplasmic type CiLV-C) and another one in the nucleus (_Citrus leprosis virus_ nuclear type CiLV-N). CiLV-N is restricted to the states of Sao Paulo, Rio Grande do Sul, and Minas Gerais in Brazil and Boquete district in Panama, whereas CiLV-C has been spreading rapidly in South and Central America. In Colombia, symptoms resembling those of citrus leprosis were observed in multiple locations [see ProMED-mail post 20060408.1059]. Recent molecular studies have indicated that a new virus closely related to CiLV-C and belonging to the genus _Cilevirus_ was present in diseased plants. This new virus was tentatively called Citrus leprosis virus cytoplasmic type 2 (CiLV-C2).

[[Item [1]
---------
Begomoviruses (type member _Bean golden yellow mosaic virus_) are transmitted by different whitefly vectors (which are a serious pest in themselves) and many can also be transmitted by mechanical means and grafting, but they are not seed transmitted. Begomovirus control is particularly difficult in open field crops due to the widespread presence and wide host range of whiteflies. Disease management may include pathogen exclusion, vector control and elimination of possible pathogen and/or vector reservoir plants. In some cases, crop cultivars with increased virus resistance are available.

Item [2]
--------
Tospoviruses (type member _Tomato spotted wilt virus_) are an extremely important group of plant viruses capable of infecting a large range of crops. They are transmitted exclusively by thrips species which are found worldwide. Weed species can serve as pathogen or vector reservoirs and tospovirus epidemiology is complex. Disease management is difficult but may include vector control (for glasshouse crops), use of clean planting material, control of weed hosts of virus and vectors, phytosanitary measures and use of resistant crop cultivars. Due to their agricultural importance, research on tospoviruses has increased dramatically in recent years. As a result, many new species are being found and many more can be expected to exist.

Item [3]
--------
Citrus vein enation disease (CVED) leads to tree decline and was previously suspected to be caused by a virus. It may not be limited to citrus and is also thought to be related to other woody gall problems. Field diagnosis by symptoms is difficult since leaf enations (distortions) may be hard to recognise and woody galls on trunks or branches may also be due to other factors (such as insects). In many citrus hosts, infection is symptomless. CVED has been shown to be transmitted by several aphid species and grafting, but not with seed. CVED development is favoured by cool temperatures. Thermotherapy and shoot-tip grafting can be used to produce disease-free grafting material. The study above has now identified and characterised an associated virus. Its provisional genus _Enamovirus_ belongs to the family _Luteoviridae_.

Item [4]
--------
Citrus leprosis is a devastating disease caused by _Citrus leprosis virus_ (CiLV; only member of genus _Cilevirus_, not assigned to a family or order). So far, it has only been reported from the Americas where it appears to be spreading, and it has been placed on the A1 quarantine list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO). Symptoms may include lesions on fruits, leaves, and twigs, premature leaf and fruit drop, defoliation, severe necrosis of new shoots, dieback of branches, bark scaling, as well as reduction of the canopy leading to serious tree decline and significant yield losses. CiLV only affects _Citrus_ species, and primarily sweet orange varieties (_C. sinensis_) are susceptible. Other species and hybrids have variable levels of resistance and some may not show symptoms serving as latent virus reservoirs.

Two forms of CiLV exist, one occurring in the cytoplasm, the other in the nucleus of infected host cells. Cytoplasmic CiLV (CiLV-C) has been shown to be the prevalent type in orchards. Both types are spread by the flat mite (or false spider mite, _Brevipalpus phoenicis_) and other related mite species. Unlike many other plant viruses, CiLV does not become systemic, which means each lesion represents a feeding puncture of an infected vector. Infectious mites may be spread with plant material such as budwood or rooted plantlets, and the leprosis risk is particularly high for areas where vector species are already present.

Disease management may include cultural methods to reduce virus and vector reservoirs, but mainly relies on controlling the mites. Most currently available miticides are effective and are applied once the vector reaches economic thresholds. Biological control by mite predators is being used occasionally. Disease levels often increase when crop prices fall due to farmers saving costs by reducing chemicals. Crop varieties with increased levels of resistance are available, but none of the commercial sweet orange varieties are resistant to leprosis.

Citrus leprosis in Colombia was previously shown to be caused by cytoplasmic Citrus leprosis virus. CiLV-C was first reported there in 2006 (ProMED-mail post 20060408.1059) with high sequence homology to Brazilian isolates. Item [4] above has now differentiated the Colombian strain as a different species.
