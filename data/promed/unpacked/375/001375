Further evidence of West Nile virus in birds in New York City
-------------------------------------------------------------
New York City Health Commissioner Neal L. Cohen, M.D., announced that
evidence of West Nile virus (WNV) was confirmed today by the New York State
Department of Health in 15 additional birds collected in New York City,
including a crow collected on 25 Jul in northern Manhattan, where evidence
of WNV had not previously been confirmed this year. Another crow was
collected in Central Park in Manhattan on 23 Jul, a day before the earlier
spraying effort took place in Central Park. The other 14 birds were
collected in Staten Island from 18-24 Jul.
In Central Park and Alley Pond Park, mosquito trapping indicates a possible
re-emergence of mosquitoes. We are scheduling spraying in those areas as a
preventive measure to protect the public health," Dr. Cohen said.
The two birds identified in Manhattan were crows. The 14 birds collected in
various areas of Staten Island include 8 crows, 3 sparrows, 2 blue jays,
and one cockatiel [an exotic species -- not stated whether caged or feral.
- Mod.JW]. To date, a total of 32 WNV-infected birds have been identified
in New York City (27 in Staten Island, 3 in Queens, and 2 in Manhattan),
and WNV has been confirmed in 3 pools of mosquitoes (2 in Staten Island,
one in Manhattan).
