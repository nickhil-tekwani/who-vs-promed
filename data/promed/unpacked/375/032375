Doctors are seeing more dengue and chikungunya cases in the city. "The irregular rainfall has to be blamed for this. We see many fever cases than the usual ones," said a senior doctor at a government hospital. Apart from dengue, the doctor says they are also seeing viral fever that is similar to dengue. "When tested, such fever shows negative for dengue, so we treat it as viral fever," he adds.

Dr Sivamurugan, orthopaedic surgeon of Soundarapandian Bone and Joint Hospital, says that he has been treating chikungunya cases for a few weeks now. "We had a chikungunya outbreak in 2006 with more elderly people getting affected. But this is not that severe, and the platelet count is not coming down. I have seen at least 20 patients in just 15 days with more people in the age group of 45-50 years. They complain of severe joint pain and swelling," he said.

Chikungunya virus is transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_ mosquitoes during daytime. Viral fever with upper respiratory infection and joint pain should be tested immediately, say doctors.

When contacted, a senior health official said the corporation had intensified its anti-mosquito operations to reduce the incidence of dengue and chikungunya cases in the city. "Fogging is being carried out to prevent breeding of _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes. We are also educating people to clean water containers," the official said, denying chikungunya cases in the city.

[There have been scattered outbreaks of chikungunya virus infections in several localities around India this year (2013). This is the 1st report of an outbreak in Tamil Nadu state that has come to ProMED's attention. The total number of chikungunya cases in this outbreak is not given, but the number of cases seeking medical attention over the past 2 weeks is a clear indication that an outbreak is under way. It is not clear whether the diagnoses of chikungunya virus infection are based solely on clinical grounds or whether some or all are laboratory diagnosed as well. Cleaning or eliminating water containers is more likely to affect vector mosquito control than fogging would.
