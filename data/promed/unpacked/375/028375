Federal authorities are testing chickens from a western Arizona Indian
reservation to determine whether they were infected with a deadly and highly
infectious bird virus.
The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) sent a veterinarian
to the Colorado River Indian Tribes' reservation this week after a farmer
near Poston reported that about 30 of his chickens had died suddenly, tribal
officials said Friday.
The rest of the flock, about another 20 birds, was immediately euthanized,
and the tribal government quarantined all domestic birds on the reservation,
which is on the Arizona-California state line, said Eric Shepard, acting
tribal attorney general. Shepard said the quarantine is just a precaution.
A US Department of Agriculture (USDA) lab is testing the birds to determine
whether they had contracted Exotic Newcastle Disease, which has led to the
slaughter of hundreds of thousands of chickens in Southern California.
Officials have also placed a quarantine on poultry and pet birds from
California to southern Nevada. The disease is highly contagious among
poultry and [other] birds but poses no health risks for humans.
"We are working very closely with USDA officials to make sure this incident
remains as isolated as possible," said tribal Chairman Daniel Eddy Jr. "We
want to make sure we do as much as possible in cooperation with the federal
authorities to address this situation and make sure poultry in this region
is not affected." The tribe said the test results will be released as soon
as they're available. Shepard said there are no commercial poultry
operations on the reservation.
