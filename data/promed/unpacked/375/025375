As many as 3 villages in Turkey's northwestern province of Kocaeli were quarantined after anthrax was diagnosed in cattle on a local farm, the Diken news website reported on [Sun 9 Sep 2018].

Anthrax was 1st found in cattle imported from Brazil before the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha, causing the death of 50 cattle on a farm in Ankara province. Hospitals in Ä°stanbul and Sivas also detected anthrax in 9 people who were sent for medical screening. In another case in Bitlis, more than 100 cattle died in one day from anthrax.

According to reports in the Turkish media, the cattle import agreement with Brazil omitted a health inspection of the animals by Turkish officials.

[We commend Turkey for its prompt reporting of cases. Livestock cases occurred in Kocaeli in 2007 and 2012. Livestock anthrax is less frequently reported in western Turkey and this farm is distant from the other outbreaks reported so far this year.
