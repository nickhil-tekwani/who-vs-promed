French Polynesia has confirmed 541 cases of the mosquito borne illness chikungunya in the last 3 weeks of October [2014].

The most recent surveillance report by health authorities says 509 of those cases were from Tahiti.

Chikungunya outbreaks are also ongoing in American Samoa, Samoa and Tokelau [territory of New Zealand]. More than 3000 people in the region have been affected by the current epidemic, mostly in French Polynesia.

[The outbreak of chikungunya fever continues to spread rapidly and is intensifying in French Polynesia. Tahiti is part of the Society Islands archipelago and capital of the collectivity that is French Polynesia. Given the inter-island movement within French Polynesia, it is not surprising to see chikungunya virus appear on Tahiti and spread to other islands with suspected cases of chikungunya virus infection on Tubuai, Raiatea and Apataki atoll. Since there are no commercially available vaccines available yet for chikungunya virus, the only preventive measures are vector control and avoidance of mosquito bites.
