York State Department of Health and Rockland County Department of Health Alert the Public to A Case of Polio In the County
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rockland County Community Members Can Schedule a Vaccine at http://rocklandgov.com/departments/health/clinics-and-immunizations/

The New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) and the Rockland County Department of Health today [21 Jul 2022] alerted the public to a case of polio in a Rockland County resident. State and County health officials are advising medical practitioners and healthcare providers to be vigilant for additional cases.

As the polio vaccine continues to be included on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) standard child immunization schedule, those already vaccinated are considered to be at lower risk. Notably, the polio vaccine is part of the required school immunization schedule for all children, and therefore school-age children are vaccinated before they start school. However, individuals who are unvaccinated, including those who are pregnant, those who have not completed their polio vaccine series previously, or community members who are concerned they have might have been exposed, should get vaccinated by Rockland County -- who will be hosting local vaccine clinics -- or partnering health agencies and providers in the area. Individuals who are already vaccinated but are at risk of exposure should receive a booster.

"Based on what we know about this case, and polio in general, the Department of Health strongly recommends that unvaccinated individuals get vaccinated or boosted with the FDA-approved IPV polio vaccine as soon as possible," State Health Commissioner Dr. Mary T. Bassett said. "The polio vaccine is safe and effective, protecting against this potentially debilitating disease, and it has been part of the backbone of required, routine childhood immunizations recommended by health officials and public health agencies nationwide."

A viral disease that can affect the nervous system and cause muscle weakness, the polio virus typically enters the body through the mouth, usually from hands contaminated with fecal matter of an infected person. Respiratory and oral-to-oral transmission through saliva may also occur.

Polio is very contagious, and a person can spread the virus even if they aren't sick. Symptoms, which can be mild and flu-like (fatigue, fever, headache, stiffness, muscle pain, vomiting), can take up to 30 days to appear, during which time an infected individual can be shedding virus to others. Though rare, some polio cases can result in paralysis or death.

In this case, sequencing performed by the Wadsworth Center -- NYSDOH's public health laboratory -- and confirmed by CDC showed revertant polio Sabin type 2 virus. This is indicative of a transmission chain from an individual who received the oral polio vaccine (OPV), which is no longer authorized or administered in the U.S., where only the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) has been given since 2000. This suggests that the virus may have originated in a location outside of the U.S. where OPV is administered, since revertant strains cannot emerge from inactivated vaccines.

"Many of you may be too young to remember polio, but when I was growing up, this disease struck fear in families, including my own," County Executive Ed Day said. "The fact that it is still around decades after the vaccine was created shows you just how relentless it is. Do the right thing for your child and the greater good of your community and have your child vaccinated now."

Due to the success of the vaccine, which was introduced in 1955, and a national vaccination program, polio cases were cut dramatically in the late 1950s and early 1960s, with the last naturally occurring cases of polio in the U.S. recorded in 1979. More recent polio cases were not wild strains, with the last known case in the U.S. recorded by CDC in 2013.

"Vaccines have protected our health against old and new viruses for decades," New York City Health Commissioner Dr. Ashwin Vasan said. "The fact is, the urgency of safe and effective vaccines has always been here, and we need New Yorkers to protect themselves against completely preventable viruses like Polio."

NYSDOH is coordinating with the Rockland County Department of Health and the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYCDOHMH) to continue the case investigation, proactively respond, and protect communities against spread through urging vaccination, which will be supported by this multi-agency, county-led effort.

"The Rockland County Department of Health is working with our local health care partners and community leaders to notify the public and make polio vaccination available. We are monitoring the situation closely and working with the New York State Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to respond to this emergent public health issue to protect the health and wellbeing of county residents," Rockland County Health Commissioner Dr. Patricia Schnabel Ruppert said.

Beginning on Friday [22 Jul 2022], Rockland County will host a polio vaccination clinic at the Pomona Health Complex (Building A) at 50 Sanatorium Road in Pomona, New York from 10:00 am-12:00 pm. A second clinic at the same location will be held on Monday [25 Jul 2022] from 1:00 pm to 4:00 pm. Anyone who is unvaccinated -- including those who are pregnant -- has not completed their polio vaccine series, or are concerned they have might have been exposed, should get vaccinated at the clinics. Individuals who are already vaccinated but are at risk of exposure should receive a booster, which will also be available at the clinics.

New Yorkers can pre-register for a free appointment at http://rocklandgov.com/departments/health/clinics-and-immunizations/ or call 845-238-1956 to schedule. Walk-ins will also be accepted.

Vaccines are also available through local healthcare providers, including Federally Qualified Health Centers.

Unvaccinated Rockland County, N.Y. man diagnosed with polio
-----------------------------------------------------------
The 1st U.S. case of polio in nearly a decade has been confirmed in an unvaccinated individual in Rockland County, N.Y., local and state health officials announced Thursday [21 Jul 2022].

While the origins of the case are still being investigated, the 20-year-old man had traveled to Poland and Hungary earlier this year [2022] and was hospitalized in June [2022], according to a public health official close to the investigation who was not authorized to speak on the record. He was initially diagnosed with a possible case of acute flaccid myelitis, caused by inflammation of the spinal cord that results in severe muscle weakness and paralysis. But subsequent testing detected a type of polio that indicates transmission from outside the United States, according to a joint alert Thursday [21 Jul 2022] from the New York State Health Department and Rockland County.

The patient has since been discharged and living at home with his wife. He is able to stand, but is having difficulty walking, the official said.

Rockland County and New York State health officials on Thursday [21 Jul 2022] alerted clinicians to be vigilant for additional cases. Asked about the possibility of more polio cases emerging locally, Rockland County Health Commissioner Patricia Schnabel Ruppert said at a news conference, "We only have the one case. Let's hope that's all we find."

Rockland County Executive Ed Day said the patient who is infected is not contagious.

"Right now, the risk to the vaccinated public is low, but experts are working to understand how and where this individual was infected," the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement.

Polio is a life-threatening viral disease that causes permanent paralysis in people who are not fully vaccinated in about 5 out of every 1000 cases. Most of the U.S. population has protection against the disease because they were vaccinated during childhood. But in areas with low vaccination coverage, such as the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community in Rockland County, people who are not vaccinated are at high risk. There is no treatment for polio, but vaccination prevents the disease.

Due to the success of a national vaccination program after the vaccine was introduced in 1955, polio cases were cut dramatically. The last naturally occurring cases in the United States were recorded in 1979.

While still rare, more recent polio infections in the United States were imported through travel or contact with someone who had received oral polio vaccine in another country. The last known U.S. case was recorded by the CDC in 2013.

Polio is very contagious, and a person can spread the virus even if they aren't sick. Symptoms, which can be mild and flu-like, can take up to 30 days to appear, during which time an infected individual can shed the virus to others. Though rare, some polio cases can result in paralysis or death.

The virus typically enters the body through the mouth, usually from hands contaminated with the fecal matter of an infected person. Respiratory transmission and oral to oral transmission through saliva may also account for some cases.

Up to 95% of people infected with polio have no symptoms, yet they can still spread the virus. About 4 to 5% of infected people have minor symptoms such as fever, muscle weakness, headache, nausea, and vomiting. One to 2% of infected people develop severe muscle pain and stiffness in the neck and back. Less than 1% of polio infections result in paralysis.

The Rockland County man lives in a community that has been historically undervaccinated and was the epicenter of the measles outbreak in 2019, according to the public health official who spoke on condition on anonymity.

In this case, genetic sequencing performed by the Wadsworth Center, New York state's public health laboratory, and confirmed by the CDC, showed a type of polio virus that indicates transmission from someone who received the oral polio vaccine, according to an alert issued Thursday [21 Jul 2022] by the New York State Health Department and Rockland County, N.Y.

There are 2 types of vaccine that can prevent polio. Inactivated poliovirus vaccine, or IPV, is given as an injection in the leg or arm, depending on the patient's age. Only IPV has been used in the United States since 2000.

Oral poliovirus vaccine, or OPV, is still used throughout much of the world. The oral polio vaccine is no longer authorized or administered in the United States because of its potential to cause vaccine-derived poliovirus. This case suggests that the virus may have originated in a location where the oral vaccine is administered, outside of the United States, the alert from New York state and Rockland County said.

Wild type polio is the naturally occurring form of the virus. However some people can become infected from a weakened strain of the virus that was used to make the oral polio vaccine early on. Most countries, including the U.S., immunize children using vaccine made from a form of the virus that is no longer alive.

Vaccine-derived polio can emerge if the weakened live virus contained in the oral polio vaccine, shed by vaccinated children, is allowed to circulate in under-immunized populations for long enough to genetically revert to a version that causes paralysis, the CDC said in its statement. Cases of vaccine-derived polio "are not caused by a child receiving the polio vaccine."

"Many of you may be too young to remember polio, but when I was growing up, this disease struck fear in families, including my own," Day said in a statement. "The fact that it is still around decades after the vaccine was created shows you just how relentless it is. Do the right thing for your child and the greater good of your community and have your child vaccinated now."

The coronavirus pandemic has resulted in a drop in routine immunization rates, according to recent reports. Nearly 400 000 fewer children entered kindergarten in the United States during the last school year because of pandemic-related disruptions, raising concerns that no one knows how many kids received childhood vaccinations for common diseases, according to federal health data released this spring [2022]. All states require childhood vaccinations for illnesses such as polio, measles and whooping cough.

Rockland County plans to host polio vaccination clinics starting Friday [22 Jul 2022]. Health officials are urging anyone who is unvaccinated, including those who are pregnant, or are concerned they might have been exposed, to get vaccinated. Individuals who are already vaccinated but are at risk of exposure should receive a booster, which will also be available at the clinics.

[This announcement comes exactly 1 month following the identification of a VDPV2 in environmental samples in London, England, in the UK. To date, no associated AFP (acute flaccid paralysis) cases have been identified in the UK. (see Poliomyelitis update (26): VDPV2 (UK) ES 20220622.8704024).

In this report from Rockland County, there is an AFP case associated with infection with a VDPV2 -- a 20-year-old unvaccinated male with apparent lower extremity involvement. Unfortunately, this individual lives in a community that does not have adequate levels of vaccination coverage which may forebode additional cases being identified -- if the virus circulates further in the community. The suggestion in the report is that this is not a circulating VDPV, but rather a VAPP (vaccine associated paralytic polio) cases associated with contact with a recently vaccinated individual. (see https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/polio/hcp/vaccine-derived-poliovirus-faq.html#:~:text=A%20vaccine%2Dderived%20poliovirus%20(VDPV,wild%20or%20naturally%20occurring%20virus.) hence the statement the individual is not contageous.

The last outbreak of WPV1 in the USA occurred in another population group also not accepting vaccinations. When the outbreak was over there were a total of 17 cases in North America -- 15 in 4 different states in the USA and 2 cases in Canada. (see https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00050435.htm for more details). The last WPV1 case reported in the USA was in 2013 -- an imported case involving an infant travelling from India to the USA.

There is mention of travel to Poland and Hungary this year (2022) -- according to WHO, Poland uses exclusively IPV (https://immunizationdata.who.int/pages/schedule-by-country/pol.html?DISEASECODE=POLIO&TARGETPOP_GENERAL=, as does Hungary (https://immunizationdata.who.int/pages/schedule-by-country/hun.html?DISEASECODE=POLIO&TARGETPOP_GENERAL=). Hence, one is hard pressed to claim that travel was responsible for the infection.

The occurrence of importations of VDPVs into countries that have interrupted WPV circulation, and countries that have discontinued use of OPV is further documentation of the changed picture with polio infections globally -- there are more cases of AFP due to infection with VDPVs globally than AFP cases due to infection with WPVs. In 2021 there were 6 cases of AFP attributable to WPV1 and 698 cases of AFP attributable to VDPVs. (see Poliomyelitis update (29): WPV1 ES (Pakistan) VDPV2 (new country Algeria) WHO 20220715.8704423). Vaccine-associated AFP cases contribute to the growing vaccine hesitancy globally.

Rockland County is located to the Northwest of New York City, with regular communications with similar population groups in New York City.
