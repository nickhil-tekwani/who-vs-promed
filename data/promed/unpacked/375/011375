1st case of bat rabies in Finland
---------------------------------
The Finnish Food Safety Authority (Evira) received a bat (Daubenton's
bat, _Myotis daubentoni_) for laboratory analyses. The bat had bitten
a researcher and his assistant several times earlier that day.
Laboratory analyses conducted during the 15, 16 and 17 Aug 2009,
confirmed that the bat had clinical rabies. The virus was identified
as European Bat Lyssavirus 2 (EBLV-2) by RT-PCR. Also cell culture is
positive. More precise typing is ongoing.

The bat originated from Turku (Abo) in south western Finland. This is
the 1st case of bat rabies in Finland. The researcher and his
assistant had been vaccinated against rabies. However, preventive
[post-exposure] medication was started on Fri 14 Aug 2009. Evira has
issued a press release concerning the case.

[The Evira press release reads as follow: "Current issues - Research
on animal diseases and food 19.08.2009 - 12:58. Bat rabies has been
confirmed for the 1st time in Finland. The bat (Daubenton's Bat or
_Myotis daubentoni)_ was sent to Evira from the Turku area on 14 Aug
2009. European Bat Lyssavirus-2 (EBLV-2) was isolated from the bat."

European Bat Lyssaviruses (EBLVs) 1 and 2, commonly referred to as
bat rabies, are 2 strains of rabies-related lyssaviruses found in
bats across Northern Europe. On rare occasions EBLVs have been known
to infect other animals and humans. The risk of EBLV infection to
humans is thought to be low. However, since 1977 there have been 5
human deaths in Europe (3 confirmed, 2 possible) from EBLVs, all in
cases where the human had been bitten or scratched by bats and had
not received rabies vaccination either before or after being bitten by bats.
