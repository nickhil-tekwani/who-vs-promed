NSW Food Authority on [Sat 8 Sep 2018], said 23 cases of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Enteritidis had been confirmed in Sydney, leading to egg supplier Eggz on the Run to voluntarily recall some products sold under the Glendenning Farm brand. Consumers are advised not to consume any Glendenning Farm whole shell eggs sold in NSW with best before dates of Sep 8, 10, 15, 17, 22, 24, 29 or Oct 1 [2018]. The products were sold in small independent supermarkets and retailers.

"Either bin or return them to the place of purchase for a full refund," NSW Food Authority said in a statement. "You do not require proof of purchase for a recalled item."

Fever, headache, diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting are symptoms of salmonellosis and usually start about 6 to 72 hours after the contaminated food is eaten. Illness can last 7 days or longer.

The government has restricted the movement of livestock, eggs, manure and disposables at the farm and ordered the disinfection and decontamination of equipment.

Investigations are still ongoing.

[Salmonellosis is often thought to be associated with cracked eggs or eggs dirty with fecal matter, a problem controlled by cleaning procedures implemented in the egg industry. It is clearly the case, however, that most of the salmonellosis outbreaks linked to eggs were associated with uncracked, disinfected grade A eggs, or foods containing such eggs. The undamaged eggs become contaminated during ovulation, and thus were contaminated with the bacteria before the egg shell was formed. To avoid this, uncooked eggs should only be used as an ingredient, if pasteurized. - Mod.LL
