The Ministry of Public Health of Sonora reported that this year [2010]
a total of 44 people have been infected by rickettsiae, 5 of whom
died. The director of the Epidemiology Department of the state agency,
Sergio Olvera Alba, said that the southern region of the state
[Sonora] is where most cases of the disease have occurred, spread by
the bite of lice, ticks, fleas and mites.

He said that to date, the disease has been detected in the
municipalities of Guaymas, Ciudad Obregon, Hermosillo, Navojoa,
Nogales, Quiriego, Huatabampo, Puerto Penasco and Etchojoa. Of the
deaths attributable to this disease, 2 were reported in the
municipality of Miguel Aleman and the other 3 in Nogales, north of the
town, he said.

The bacteria are transmitted to humans through the bite of ticks, he
said, which are carried by household pets such as dogs. The doctor
said that keeping dogs and cats clean reduces the possibility of them
having parasites which may be agents of disease. He added that
children are the age group most at risk, as they have more direct
contact with dogs and play on the floor.

According to information from the state SSP [health secretariat], it
is maintaining a campaign to inform communities about the importance
of measures to prevent rickettsiosis.

[The species of rickettsia here is not specifically mentioned, but the
attention to dogs and ticks suggests that the illness is due to
_Rickettsia rickettsii_.

_R. rickettsii_ infections have been identified in southern Canada,
the USA, northern Mexico, Costa Rica, Panama, Brazil, and Argentina.
Some synonyms for Rocky Mountain spotted fever in other countries
include tick typhus, Tobia fever (Colombia), Sao Paulo fever and
fiebre maculosa (Brazil), and fiebre manchada (Mexico). - Mod.LL]
