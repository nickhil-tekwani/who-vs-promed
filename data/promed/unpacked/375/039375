U.S. researchers studying the bird flu that sparked a public panic
announced Monday they had completed a Hong Kong survey regarding possible
human-to-human transmission and would announce the first results in six
weeks. "We have two critical questions to answer and hope that the data we
have collected will give us those answers," said Dr. Keiji Fukuda, who
headed the survey conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. "We are looking for evidence of human-to-human transmission of
the H5N1 (bird flu) virus and we hope to identify any risk factors and any
behaviors that may put someone at greater risk for contracting the virus,"
Fukuda added in a statement. The last American specialists in Hong Kong
will return to the United States this week, the CDC said. They are expected
to deliver their results to Hong Kong medical officials by the end of
February.
During their two-month epidemiological survey, the researchers collected
roughly 3,300 blood samples from nearly 2,900 people who may or may not
have been infected by the virus. The center said earlier this month it had
isolated the virus' protein, taken from a three-year-old boy who died in
May. Some 18 confirmed cases and another suspected case of bird flu have
been identified since the virus was first reported last year. So far, 11
people have recovered, six have died and two are still being treated.
