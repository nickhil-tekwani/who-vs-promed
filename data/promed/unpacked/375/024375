Kenya: 5 More Die of Rift Valley Fever
-----------------------------------------
5 people have died of complications associated with Rift Valley fever
(RVF) in North Eastern Province, a doctor said yesterday [27 Mar
2007]. Provincial medical officer of health Ahmed Omar told
journalists in his office that the 5 contracted the highly contagious
viral disease last December [2006]. They were treated and discharged
but died of post-recovery and treatment complications in Garissa and
Ijara districts.
He also warned that the fever could reemerge in the region with the
onset of long rains, which have pounded parts of Ijara in the last 2
weeks. According to Dr. Omar, the 5 died after developing
meningo-encephalitis, a condition linked to post-recovery, a nervous
system and brain disorder that attacks those who had contracted RVF
but were discharged after recovery.
A surveillance medical team that visited parts of Garissa and Ijara
districts last week found 3 of the victims had died in the Liboi and
Fafi areas of Garissa. They had, in December [2006], been admitted to
the isolation unit of Garissa Hospital after testing positive for
RVF; 2 of the victims were women, while the 3rd was an 18-year-old
herdsman. The other 2 who died in Ijara had previously been admitted
to Masalani health centre in January 2007. The 2 herdsmen are said to
have died on their way to seek medical attention at Masalani district hospital.
Dr. Omar also said the medical team had further found several cases
of blindness among patients who were discharged from hospital between
December 2006 and January 2007. He asked those who had been
discharged from various health centers to report back to hospital
should they show post-recovery complications. According to the
doctor, 354 people infected at the height of the fever outbreak
recovered, while 106 died in Garissa, Ijara and Wajir, which had been
the epicenter of the disease before it spread to other parts of the country.
Most of those affected by the fever, which mainly affects livestock
but spreads to humans through mosquito bites, were herdsmen. Their
infections were attributed to their close contact with infected animals.
According to Dr. Omar, flooding could fuel a resurgence of the fever
because the _Aedes_ mosquitoes -- which transmit the fever -- get the
virus after feeding on infected animals. They then transmit the virus
to their eggs, and new generations of infected mosquitoes may hatch
from such eggs. The eggs hatch during heavy rains, leading to an
increase in the number of mosquitoes.
