----------------------------------------------------------------
We have recently confirmed the cause of taro blight in Nigeria as
_Phytophthora coloasiae_ [Plant Disease 2011; 95(5): 618, DOI:
10.1094/PDIS-12-10-0890; see link below].

The Centre for Pacific Crops and Trees (CePaCT) at the Secretariat of
the Pacific Community (SPC) has sent us some taro blight resistant
clones bred by the Taro Improvement Programme (TIP) in Samoa. These
clones will be evaluated in Nigeria against local isolates of the
pathogen by the National Root Crops Research Institute [NRCRI] in
collaboration with IITA [International Institute of Tropical
Agriculture].

We hope to find a lasting solution to this devastating disease soon
in Nigeria, which can also benefit the rest of the West African region
where taro blight is causing serious damage.

[Taro [_Colocasia esculenta_] leaf blight caused by the fungus
_Phytophthora colocasiae_ has been causing serious crop losses in
parts of Asia and the Pacific. In 2010, it was reported for the 1st
time from Africa (see ProMED-mail post 20100715.2365).

Symptoms include foliar lesions killing the leaf within 10-20 days
and resulting in reduced plant vigour and tuber weight. The pathogen
can be spread by wind, splashing rain, mechanical means (including
insects and human activities), and infected planting material. Disease
management using an integrated approach has been successful in the
Pacific, including cultural methods (such as crop rotation,
intercropping), fungicides, phytosanitation, and development of
cultivars with reduced levels of susceptibility.

Varying levels of disease intensity in different areas have led to
the suggestion that different strains of _P. colocasiae_ may exist, in
addition to differences in the genetic background of local crop
varieties. The assessment of the cultivars resistant to taro blight in
Samoa for their suitability to the African scenario, as reported
above, is therefore important.

We are most grateful to Dr Bandyopadhyay for this update.
