About 40 percent of banana plants in the country are affected by a bacterium destroying crops and affecting the livelihood of farmers. _Ralstonia solanacearum_ was 1st detected in Johor in 2007 [see ProMED-mail post 20081215.3937]. It has spread extensively to other states, namely Kedah, Perak, Negri Sembilan, Malacca, Pahang and Kelantan.

Bananas cover more than 26 000 ha, over 11 percent of the country's total fruit-growing areas. About 50 percent of the banana-growing area is cultivated with pisang berangan or the cavendish type. Pisang awak, Abu and nipah -- the most popular bananas used in cooking -- have almost "disappeared" due to the destroyed crops.

Mardi (Malaysian Agricultural Research and Development Institute) said the disease was believed to have been inadvertently brought into the country by farmers who carried with them planting equipment stained with soil. They said most farmers were shocked to see their crops destroyed, and all they could do was abandon their farms.

A survey in Johor showed that about 60 percent of 3212 ha of banana-plantings [in that state] were affected.

[Blood disease of banana (BD) was 1st reported in 1905 from a small island south of Sulawesi, Indonesia. In 2005, 3 million plants in Indonesia were affected with an estimated crop loss of over 60 000 tonnes.

BD, as well as the other bacterial wilts of banana known as Moko and Bugtok, are caused by members of the _Ralstonia solanacearum_ species complex. The pathogens can be clearly distinguished by their host range and other biological and biochemical properties.

Symptoms of BD may include yellowing and wilting of leaves, vascular discolouration of pseudostems and reddish to black discolouration of the interior of fruits, which makes them inedible. The bacteria may be spread by mechanical means, water splash, contaminated plant material or equipment and insects (especially from male bud to male bud). Disease management relies mostly on exclusion from new areas, but removing male buds just after fruit set has been shown to be effective in limiting pathogen spread.

All banana genotypes are affected, but susceptibility may vary between cultivars. "Pisang awak," one of the most widely distributed types, is highly susceptible. Varieties with levels of resistance or tolerance have been identified (such as "Pisang kepok") and may prove useful in resistance breeding programmes.

This is the 1st appearance of blood disease outside Indonesia. It is suspected to have spread across the Strait of Malacca from Sumatra. The spread of BD is considered a threat to food supplies for Asia, Africa and Latin America.
