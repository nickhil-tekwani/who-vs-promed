These days, finding living mussels in the creek is a far less grim task, said Sasson, a freshwater conservation manager with the Nature Conservancy.

Still, the massive die-off that stretched along almost 60 miles of Big Darby hung over a group of mussel experts this month [August 2017] as they wrapped up a diagnostic survey of the waterway."We're just trying to see if the die-off last year [2016] knocked out any species," Sasson said. "We haven't even had time to sit down and go over the numbers yet."

Big Darby is home to 44 recorded mussel species, about half of which are on state or federal lists as endangered, threatened or of special concern. The designated National Scenic River has been called Ohio's equivalent of the Great Barrier Reef.

Worries that last fall's [2016] die-off could unravel decades of conservation efforts in the creek have yet to be quelled. Initial results of last month's 3-week survey [Aug 2017] across a dozen sites in the Big Darby are mixed.

The group found federally listed mussels at several sites; elsewhere, rare species were conspicuously suffering or missing altogether. On one outing, surveyors collected hundreds of healthy mussels, but close to 90 percent of the sample belonged to a single common species.

"Some sites have been OK; other sites we have real questions about," Sasson said.

Early last October [2016], Sasson and Charlie Staudt, a Darby Creek Association member, 1st noticed mussels with their shells wide open strewn along the Big Darby. "We started seeing them everywhere. It was horrible. It was upsetting," Staudt said. "It's natural to see a few dead mussels here and there. Not dozens and hundreds."

From there, a coalition of state agencies and conservation groups documented common and endangered mussels dying in droves along the Big Darby from the Logan County line to the Franklin-Pickaway counties line.

A group of wetsuit-clad mussel experts and enthusiasts donned scuba masks and began methodically scraping the bottom of the stream. Every few minutes, a sharp eye or noodling finger spotted a mussel. After gently loosening the mussels, the surveyors tucked them in mesh bags to be counted and identified. "When you're looking for something you can't see, you have to be careful and conscientious," said Andrew Boose, a Metro Parks ecologist.

After an hour, the group sorted its collection by colorfully named species -- piling the fragile paper mussels away from the purple wartybacks, pocketbooks and pistol grips. Once the mussels were measured and recorded, the surveyors returned them to the water, where they quickly burrowed.

Nearby, Ohio State mollusk curator Tom Watters scanned the water with a wand, hoping to check in on some of the 12 000 federally endangered clubshell and northern riffleshell mussels brought there from the Allegheny River in Pennsylvania since 2008.

The transplant stands as the largest relocation of an endangered species in state history, Watters said. "The problem is finding them again. You throw them in a creek and they burrow out of sight and you'll never find them again," he said.

Mussels reproduce by releasing microscopic larvae that attach to the gills or fins of a fish, where they develop into juveniles just a 0.5 millimeter in size.

It can take years before those teeny mussels mature and reproduce as adults, so the offspring of the transplanted mussels are likely still too small to find and use as evidence that the relocation effort was successful, Watters said. And many of the parents have been swept by high water from their original sites.

"We think they're out there and we're going to keep looking," he said. "I don't see why they shouldn't take off."

It's challenging for any mussel surveyor to know whether the creatures are in good health, tucked out of sight -- or missing entirely. But when the long-lived filter feeders start dying en masse, it's an unmistakable red flag, experts say. "These are the canary in the coal mine," said Caitlin Byrne, who manages the mollusk collection at Ohio State's Museum of Biological Diversity.

And experts still don't know what last year's massive die-off signaled about Big Darby's health. Water and tissue analyses don't indicate potential contaminants, pathogens, toxins from algae, parasites, bacteria or fungi as a clear culprit.

Officials have "pretty much exhausted all potential pathways," said Deborah Millsap, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist and contaminants specialist.

For now, Sasson said, it appears last year's die-off was a one-off.

But according to Darby Creek Association President John Tetzloff, the event is just the most recent and intense symptom of the creek's declining mussel population. "In the last 30 years, the trajectory is clear: We're going to lose all of our sensitive species," Tetzloff said. "To see that slipping away is sad. It's not just the die-off. It's a trend."
