12 persons in a Dalit colony at Torenur in Somwarpet taluk of Kodagu
district are reported to be suffering from anthrax, according to the
Department of Health and a District Surveillance unit on Tuesday. One of
the 12 affected persons has been moved to K.R. Hospital in Mysore. The
others are being treated at Torenur at a special clinic. It is said that
the 12 had developed skin lesions and ulceration.
More than a dozen cattle died at Torenur recently under mysterious
circumstances. A few days ago deaths of vultures, crows, and stray dogs
that had fed on the carcasses of dead cattle came to light. One calf died
today.
Vishwanath Kumar, District Health Officer, told The Hindu on Tuesday that
the infected cattle had been inoculated [sic] and the situation was under
control.
Anthrax cases were noticed at Shirangala in Hassan district a few days ago.
Deputy Director Srinivasulu of the Department of Communicable Diseases,
Bangalore, visited the affected areas and instructed those concerned to
take care to prevent the disease from spreading.
The District Surveillance Officer, Dr. Devadas, told The Hindu that blood
samples of the 12 affected persons would be sent to the National Institute
of Communicable Diseases, New Delhi, for examination. Penicillin was the
best [treatment] for the disease, he said.
About anthrax entering Kodagu, Dr. Devadas said that 2 months ago several
pigs transported to Kodagu from Tamil Nadu died, and their carcasses were
thrown away at Torenur.
Cattle feeding on the grass where the carcasses lay could have contracted
the disease. Dr. Devadas said a sanitary worker from the Torenur Gram
Panchayat, Kushala, had removed the skin from the carcasses of the cattle,
which were not buried, and allegedly supplied the meat of the animals to
some residents of the Dalit colony.
The last detected anthrax case in the State at Heggdadevanakote was in
Mysore district in July 1999, where 5 tribal people who ate deer meat died.
The disease is restricted to Torenur. The Forest Department and the Animal
Husbandry Department have been told to report to the Department of Health
any animal deaths.
The carcasses should be buried 6 feet deep only after conducting
postmortem. Quick lime and soil in the proportion of 1:3 should be applied
to kill the bacilli. Otherwise, they could be alive even deep inside the
soil for several years, Dr. Devadas said.

[Anthrax is hyperendemic in Tamil Nadu, so it is not impossible that some
sick incubating pigs would die in transit. It is now probably too late to
tell whether they died from anthrax, as much of the above report is
anecdotal and speculative. That people handling the various carcasses came
down with cutaneous anthrax is as one would expect. So far there are no
reports of gastro-enteric cases, but it is early days. Birds, including
vultures and crows, are normally resistant to this infection, so if any did
die, it would have been from something else.
It is strongly advised that anthrax carcasses not be cut open, but instead
should be burnt. Burial is a poor third option, even with quick lime;
skinned and butchered carcasses are certain to have a plenitude of spores
that will rise from the grave to cause problems another day. Postmortems
are unnecessary if one has first obtained and examined a fixed and stained
blood smear, even if only with Gram's stain; a stain such as Loefflers or
McFadian will show the capsule nicely. Necropsy of anthrax cases only adds
significantly to the existing environmental contamination and if not done
carefully, can result in skin lesions for the field pathologist. - Mod.MHJ]
