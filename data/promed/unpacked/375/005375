Cattle ranchers in the northwestern region of Honduras are concerned about an outbreak of brucellosis and bovine tuberculosis that is affecting cattle in the country. Jorge Handal, chairman of the Cattlemen's Association (Agas, by its initials in Spanish) said that unless action is taken these [outbreaks] can turn into an epidemic that could deal a serious blow to Honduran livestock because the bacteria affect the breeding cow, which would not be able to breed again.

"The livestock sector in Honduras has been given a real hit. If this [outbreak) becomes an epidemic, and we hope to God that it will not, all the cattle could be lost," said Handal, who has called upon President Porfirio Lobo to revive a [livestock] health program to control the outbreak of the bacteria.

Livestock producers attended a seminar given by Julio Paredes, a veterinarian and microbiologist from Ecuador, on how to detect positive cases of the bacteria in cattle and what measures to take. These bacteria are a problem that occurs in all countries that have livestock.

[We do not often hear of simultaneous outbreaks of bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis, but it can happen.

Bovine brucellosis, caused by the bacterium _Brucella abortus_, is an economically important cause of abortions in cattle. _B. abortus_ also affects other species including bison, buffalo, and elk; some species are maintenance hosts for this organism. Infections in wildlife can hinder eradication efforts in cattle. In addition, _B. abortus_ is a human pathogen. In humans, brucellosis can be a serious, debilitating, and sometimes chronic disease that may affect a variety of organs. Most cases are the result of occupational exposure to infected animals, but infections can also occur from ingesting contaminated dairy products.

In animals, _B. abortus_ frequently causes abortion, especially in bovine, and is usually transmitted by contact with the placenta, fetus, fetal fluids, and vaginal discharges from infected animals. Animals are infectious after either abortion or full-term parturition. _B. abortus_ may also be found in the milk, urine, semen, feces, and hygroma [cystic swelling containing a serous fluid] fluids. Shedding in milk can be prolonged or lifelong, and may be intermittent. Many infected cattle become chronic carriers.

Understanding the epidemiology of the disease, where it came from, and how it came to be in a particular herd are important aspects of controlling the disease. This investigation allows one to determine how far the disease has spread, and therefore, how to contain it.

_B. abortus_ can be eradicated from a herd by test and removal procedures, or by depopulation. It is possible, using this method, to become brucellosis free.

Bovine tuberculosis is a chronic bacterial disease of cattle that occasionally affects other species of mammals. This disease is a significant zoonosis that can spread to humans, typically by the inhalation of aerosols or the ingestion of unpasteurized milk. In developed countries, eradication programs have reduced or eliminated tuberculosis in cattle, and human disease is now rare; however, reservoirs in wildlife can make complete eradication difficult. Bovine tuberculosis is still common in less developed countries, and severe economic losses can occur from livestock deaths, chronic disease, and trade restrictions. In some situations, this disease may also be a serious threat to endangered species.

Bovine tuberculosis results from infection by _Mycobacterium bovis_, a Gram positive, acid-fast bacterium in the _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ complex of the family _Mycobacteriaceae_.

_M. bovis_ can be transmitted by the inhalation of aerosols, by ingestion, or through breaks in the skin. The importance of these routes varies between species. Bovine tuberculosis is usually maintained in cattle populations, but a few other species can become reservoir hosts.

Tuberculosis is usually a chronic debilitating disease in cattle, but it can occasionally be acute and rapidly progressive. Early infections are often asymptomatic. In countries with eradication programs, most infected cattle are identified early and symptomatic infections are uncommon. In the late stages, common symptoms include progressive emaciation, a low-grade fluctuating fever, weakness, and inappetence. Animals with pulmonary involvement usually have a moist cough that is worse in the morning, during cold weather or exercise, and may have dyspnea or tachypnea. In the terminal stages, animals may become extremely emaciated and develop acute respiratory distress.

Bovine tuberculosis can be controlled by test-and-slaughter or test-and-segregation methods. Affected herds are re-tested periodically to eliminate cattle that may shed the organism; the tuberculin test is generally used. Infected herds are usually quarantined, and animals that have been in contact with reactors are traced. Only test-and-slaughter techniques are guaranteed to eradicate tuberculosis from domesticated animals.

While there is a vaccine to control brucellosis in bovines, until recently there has not been a vaccine for tuberculosis in bovines. There is a vaccine showing promise and is under development.
