Rise in Malaria Cases in La Convencion Related to Temperature Increase
The phenomenon of El Nino is causing a rise in the temperature in El Valle
de La Convencion, to the north of Cusco, where increased numbers of proven
cases of malaria have appeared according to Regional Director of Health,
Carlos Gonzales Campana.
He explained that until this year, in the tropical regions of Cusco, above
all, Echarati, Palma Real, Quellouno, Yanatile, Kiteni an Lares, among
other communities, there exist 4 thousand cases of malaria, and cases have
increased by 25 per cent.
According to reports form La Convencion, the climatic variation that is
rooted in the phenomenon of El Nino is effecting the increase of mosquitos,
above all Anopheles, that propagate malaria. Currently, he said there has
been an outbreak from 1000 to 1200 cases of malaria.
Gonzales Campana assured that he has coordinated with authorties of
Education, Health, Agriculture, local governments, and community and
non-governmental organizations to bring about efforts to control malaria
that is causing havoc in the tropical valleys of Cusco.
While authorities of the Ministry of Health are reporting around 5 thousand
proven cases of malaria, local officials maintain that those ill with the
disease exceed 10,000 adults, youths, and children.
The residents of El Valle de La Convencion have asked the government to
declare a health emergency in the valleys where malaria is endemic since
cases of the disease increase day by day.
The Director of Health maintained that the World Bank and the Swiss Agency
for Development and Cooperation have shown their interest in helping to
control the disease. In this undertaking, the Director noted the
collaboration of medical personnel, the Ministry of Health,
non-governmental organization, and communities of farmers and indigenous
peoples in the affected areas.
He reiterated that according to studies of last year in different endemic
regions of the Department (above all in La Convencion), there have been
more than 4,000 cases of malaria. He reported that the World Bank has sent
group of experts to survey the situation of those who live in the edemic
areas of the region.
The Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation will discuss the donation
of basic services, above all potable water and latrines with the objective
of creating an awareness in the rural population of the importance of
having health education in homes.
The joint project, he said, will drain stagnant ponds in the endemic areas
to prevent the growth of mosquitos that transmit malaria. In addition,
power sprayers for fogging and other equipment will be used.
A report from the Director of Mixed School No. 50165 of Putucusi (Yantile),
Justino Huaman Cervantes, reports that a total of 112 students and teachers
have been affected by malaria, and many students have had been been
treated (some as many as five times) in clinics in Calca and Cusco.

[A few words about the elephant in the El Nino room. It is entirely
possible that all deaths in humans, animals and some plants will be
attributed to El Nino in some way for the forseeable future. In this case,
it is not difficult to see a clear causal pathway between increased
rainfall, more mosquitos and a 25% or greater increase in malaria.
Furthermore, this is a newspaper report and we can't expect the
establishment of causal pathways from such sources. However, I think
discussions about the effects of El Nino should have strict demarcations
between speculation concerning dislocations caused by El Nino and proven
effects of El Nino. While I don't doubt the substantial increase in the La
Convencion malaria problem may be due to climatic sources, I would like to
see data establishing the causal linkages. - Mod. pc]
