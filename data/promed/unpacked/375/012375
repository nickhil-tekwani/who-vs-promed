The Mekong Delta's Soc Trang province has reported another bird flu [avian A/H5N1 influenza virus infection] death, the 2nd case in [Viet Nam] in 2012, according to the Department of Preventive Medicine under the Ministry of Health. This is also the 2nd person having succumbed to the H5N1 virus in the Mekong Delta this year [2012] after the case in Kien Giang province, said Nguyen Van Binh, head of the department.

The 26-year-old female patient in Thanh Tri district was brought to the local hospital on 23 Jan 2012 after showing fever symptoms. She was then transferred to Bac Lieu Province General Hospital on 25 Jan 2012 with a viral pneumonia diagnosis since the illness still persisted. She died in the hospital 3 days later.

Tests conducted by the Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi Minh City [HCMC] have shown that the patient was infected with influenza A virus subtype H5N1, also known as "bird flu." According to a recent epidemiological investigation, the patient had slaughtered birds and eaten infected meat in an area where there had been mass poultry deaths.

The Ministry of Health has directed Soc Trang Province's Department of Health to strengthen anti-epidemic measures to monitor and prevent the disease from spreading further locally. The HCMC Pasteur Institute has also sent a team of anti-epidemic servicemen to support the local health department to investigate and implement preventive measures.

[Viet Nam has recorded one of the highest numbers of fatalities from bird flu in Southeast Asia, with 61 deaths since 2003, according to WHO. Winter is the season when the virus tends to boom. Since early January 2012, more than 3000 birds have been culled in Viet Nam's Mekong delta area in an effort to contain bird flu outbreaks.

As of 1 Feb 2012, the global total of human cases of avian A/(H5N1) virus infection is now 584 cases, with 345 deaths (see: "Cumulative number of confirmed human cases for avian influenza A(H5N1) reported to WHO, 2003-2012" at: http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/H5N1_cumulative_table_archives/en/index.html).

Indonesia with 184 cases, Egypt with 159 cases, and Viet Nam with 121 cases head the list of the 15 countries reporting human cases of avian A/(H5N1) influenza virus infection.
