Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1 (OIE/Report/IN/VOLI/3): Dabel, Golo, Moyale, Eastern [Marsabit County]
Date of start of the outbreak: 19 Jan 2016
Outbreak status: Continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Village
Total animals affected
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Camelidae / 66 000 / 31 000 / 257 / 0 / 0
Affected population: The affected population consists of herds of camels reared under pastoral system of production.
Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]:
Species / morbidity rate / mortality rate / case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Camelidae / 47 / 0.4 / 0.8 / 0.4
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: vectors
Epidemiological comments: _Ehrlichia ruminantium_ was also confirmed in amblyomma ticks collected from affected camels. First confirmation of the disease in camels in the country.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; screening; dipping / spraying; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; control of vectors; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); treatment of affected animals (oxytetracyclin and amoxicillin)
Measures to be applied: surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Martin Luscher Emerging Infectious Diseases (ML-EID) Laboratory, International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE) (Regional Laboratory)/ Camelidae / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 3 Aug 2016 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods, please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2016, Chapter 2.1.9 "Heartwater" at, http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.09_HEARTWATER.pdf, from which the following commentary is quoted:

"Heartwater (also known as cowdriosis) is an acute, fatal, non-contagious, infectious, tickborne rickettsial disease of ruminants caused by _Ehrlichia ruminantium_ (formerly _Cowdria ruminantium_) and transmitted by amblyomma ticks. It occurs in nearly all sub-Saharan countries of Africa, in its neighbouring islands, and also in the Caribbean, threatening the American mainland. The disease can cause high mortality (up to 90 per cent) in susceptible domestic ruminants. Goats and sheep are more susceptible than cattle, and European breeds are generally more susceptible than indigenous African breeds.

"Clinically, the disease most commonly presents as an acute form characterised by a sudden high fever, depressed demeanor, nervous signs and a high mortality. "Hydropericardium and hydrothorax and lung edema are commonly associated post-mortem signs. Acute and peracute clinical forms of the disease occur: in the former, there are high death rates without many clinical manifestations and in the latter, there is a higher recovery rate.

"Recovered animals become carriers of infection. Certain wild animals can play a role as reservoir; Rusa deer, white tailed deer, and springbok are susceptible to this infection and can experience high mortality".

Available literature on heartwater in Camelids is a bit sparse. "Reports of possible fatal heartwater in an African elephant (_Loxodonta Africana_) and a dromedary camel are unproven, and could have occurred from other causes" http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/heartwater.pdf. The literature also indicates that, "The mortality rate in susceptible livestock ranges from less than 10 per cent to 90 per cent, depending on the animal's species, breed and previous exposures. Morbidity and mortality rates are normally higher in non-native than indigenous breeds, and sheep and goats are usually affected more severely than cattle" http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/heartwater.pdf. The high morbidity rate in these camelids (almost 47 per cent) should draw some interest -- has the pathogen changed to increase the susceptibility in this species?

"_E. ruminantium_ is not thought to be zoonotic, but recently, positive PCR results for this organism were obtained in 3 fatal cases of human ehrlichiosis in South Africa: 2 cases occurred in children with encephalitis, vasculitis of the brain, and pulmonary edema. Clinical details were not available for the other case. _E. ruminantium_ was not proven to be the cause of death in any of the 3 people, and it remains to be determined whether this organism can cause human disease. However, it should be kept in mind that _E. ruminantium_ infects easily human endothelial cells in vitro and that immature amblyomma ticks (potentially infected) can bite humans. It has thus a zoonotic potential". http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/docs/pdf/Disease_cards/HEARTWATER_FINAL.pdf

Moyale is a market town on the border of Ethiopia and Kenya, which is split between the 2 countries: the larger portion is in Ethiopia (in the Oromia Region), and the smaller is in Marsabit County, Kenya (the former capital of the defunct Moyale District) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moyale.
