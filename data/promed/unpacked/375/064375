RVF in Jizan causes livestock deaths
-----------------------------------
4 heads of cattle have died in the Damad District since the
announcement of an outbreak, during the past few days, of Rift Valley
Fever (RVF) in the Jizan area, according to the Arabic daily, Okaz.
Cattle owner Mohammad Ahmad Mutahhiri said that he had informed the
agricultural branch in Abu Araish of the deaths.
The Abu Araish agricultural branch corresponded with its branch in
Sabia, and an examination of the cattle was conducted, while samples
of their blood have been sent for lab analysis.
The cattle owner said that he owns 30 heads of cattle, out of which
one head of cattle is in its last stage of RVF.

[We are told that heavy rainfall and the presence of mosquitoes are
still being reported in the region.
Adult cattle are known to be less susceptible to RVF than young
animals; sheep are more susceptible than cattle. Laboratory
investigations are necessary to confirm RVF in these 4 cases. -
