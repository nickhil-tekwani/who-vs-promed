Relative to [one of the comments of William Barnes and [the reply by the
Moderator, concerning the involvement of veterinarians in the early
detection of West Nile virus, an article in the November 15 issue of the
Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association may be of interest.

[We thank Dr. Vogel for providing this web site and article. Before we cut
this nonproductive string, I would like to present my opinion, in order to
prevent any misunderstanding of what I had said. Barnes said, "The
veterinary community must develop an infrastructure capable of identifying
and responding to these threats. Veterinarians should be more aware of the
vital role they play in protecting the public health." I took exception to
part of this and responded by saying, "The veterinary community already has
an infrastructure capable of identifying and responding to threats similar
to this one. It was U.S.D.A. that identified the virus [West Nile virus in
New York City in the first place. As for the suggestion that
veterinarians be more aware of the vital role they play in protecting the
public health, I agree completely."
The AVMA article is fluffy, light weight, inaccurate and misleading in
places. You can read it if you want, but it isn't very informative. It
suggests that veterinarians are on the front line of disease surveillance,
which is only true if one considers diseases of interest to veterinarians
or zoonotic diseases. There is no doubt in my mind that Dr. Tracey
McNamara, the Bronx Zoo pathologist, the one person who got out of the box
and necropsied dead crows and then sent samples to U.S.D.A. for virus
isolation, is one of the two heroines [the physician who reported the first
human cases is the other in this West Nile virus story. The folks at
U.S.D.A. isolated the virus and the rest is history. I have no quibbles
with any of this. I wasn't inferring criticism of veterinarians.
I have been in more than a few countries of the world and I have never,
anywhere, seen regular, high level communication between veterinarians and
physicians. There are individual veterinarians and physicians who actually
speak with each other, but this is not either the usual case or official
policy. Nowhere. Not the U.S., not Mexico, not western Europe or eastern
Europe, not Africa, not Australia, nowhere. One could point out where such
a statement is incorrect in a particular instance, and certainly when a
zoonotic situation is discovered, an epidemic is in full bloom, everyone
talks with everyone else. That's not my point.
Here's my point: Dr. McNamara began making her observations in early
August, well before the first human cases were observed. As far as I know,
she did not (could not reasonably be expected to) call the C.D.C. and say,
"Crows are dying with a disease I have never seen. Have there also been
odd cases of illness in humans?" She did not send the bird tissues to
C.D.C., she sent them to U.S.D.A.; she knew the people at U.S.D.A. U.S.D.A.
isolated but did not identify the virus, they sent it to C.D.C. where it
may not (I do not know) have received top priority because there was a
supposed St. Louis encephalitis epidemic occurring in New York City and
they were busy.
Why did U.S.D.A. not identify the virus? How could they? The lab in Ames
is not a reference center, they do not have reagents for such work. They
are intentionally focussed. They did all they could. They reported that
the virus was NOT western equine encephalitis, eastern equine encephalitis,
Venezuelan equine encephalitis, and perhaps others. They might have added
that it was not a herpesvirus, not HIV, not measles, not a lot of things.
They are not in a position to identify every virus that arrives there. This
is a reality.
Whether veterinarians are or are not aware of the "vital role they play in
protecting the public health", such awareness is irrelevant unless someone
puts the tools in their hands to do something about the situation. Absent
that, close and continuous collaboration and communication between
veterinary and human public health officials seems required if there is to
be an immediate response, not collaboration and communication to close the
barn door after the horse is out (or dead).
I see only one realistic mechanism for immediate intercommunications
between such various interest groups, ProMED-mail. Call it "preliminary",
"non-peer reviewed", "informal", "jumping the gun", and, worst of all,
"unofficial", but ProMED-mail provides hour-to-hour updates and a means of
communication between people with apparently disparate interests and
responsibilities. Veterinarians do not have human health as their prime
interest; C.D.C. likewise has its own constituency. Until mechanisms of
communications between veterinarians and physicians improve, I see
ProMED-mail as all we have, and I believe this is unfortunate. - Mod.CHC
