Regarding the recent posting of an outbreak in Kyrgyzstan, this
country may have the highest rate of brucellosis in the world. Annual
rates exceed those of adjacent countries and even traditional
"hot-spots" in southern Europe. See:
<http://exhibit.gideononline.com/Brucellosis-Kyrg.jpg>.
The incidence of human brucellosis in Kyrgyzstan in the table
compares Kyrgyzstan with Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Greece, Malta and
Turkey. The approximate statistics for Kyrgyzstan [extracted by
Mod.LL] are shown below:
Year / Cases/10 000 Population in Kyrgyzstan
1993 / 24
1994 / 18
1995 / 15
1996 / 19
1997 / 19
1998 / 20
1999 / 21

[Again, ProMED thanks Dr. Steve Berger for his continuing
contributions. The data illustrate a dramatic incidence in reported
cases since 2000. The etiology of this rise in cases is not clear. -
