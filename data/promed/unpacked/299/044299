This suggestion might be off the wall but, investigate Spirochetal
diseases.

I ran this through the GIDEON software program. Assuming a single
infectious diseases, the differential diagnosis might also include
trichinosis, loiasis (is this the 'filaria' tested for ?), toxocariasis and
HIV infection. Eosinophilia is not a feature of trypanosomiasis per se.

From: Robert S. Lewis <macaque@bigfoot.com>

Was the patient in contact with these monkeys at any time and/or with their
body
fluids? Many species of the Subfamily Cercopithecinae (baboons, macaques,
mangabeys, Patas monkeys, etc) actively shed the Herpes B virus, which is a
mere
annoyance to the monkey but deadly to humans. Does anyone on the list know
how
effective anti-viral therapy is after the patient becomes symptomatic?
When is
the best time to start anti-viral therapy?
