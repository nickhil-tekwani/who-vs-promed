Pneumonia in Guangdong Province: Background Report from Guangzhou
---------------------------------------------------
The past 2 weeks have seen the province of Guangdong in southern China
become victim to a serious pneumonia epidemic that seized its people with
fear and caused major temporary economic damage, but that eventually turned
out to have relatively slight medical impact. By last week, there had been
8 deaths.
However, considerable anxiety was created by an "epidemic of rumours."
During the first week of February 2003 the public became aware of a
mysterious respiratory illness which apparently had a very high mortality
and caused death within hours. Symptoms included cough, fever, and
breathing difficulty.
Rumours abounded about the source of the infection: a pneumonic plague
spread by rats, an avian acquired respiratory infection from chickens or
crows, a new strain of influenza, or even bioterrorism. The timing
coincided with Chinese New Year, and a week long public holiday was under
way. People spread their fears and new-found information by telephone,
mobile phone, text messages, email, and word of mouth. In the absence of
public statements and official information the media communicated very little.
The news spread that the condition had no apparent cure but that vaporising
white vinegar would help kill the infective agent. The newspapers reported
dramatically increased sales of white vinegar, cold and flu preparations,
and Chinese herbal tea. Unscrupulous pharmacists were selling preparations
that normally cost 4 yuan (GBP 0.30; USD 0.50) for 60 yuan, and shop
vendors were selling vinegar at 12 times its original price.
Meanwhile, people wore protective face masks in buses and on the street and
avoided restaurants and other crowded areas. 2 of the 4 international
schools in Guangzhou announced they would remain closed after the Chinese
New Year holiday, and some foreigners made plans to send their children
overseas.
The rumour spread that many of the victims of the illness were hospital
staff and that a number of them had died. As a result outpatient
departments almost emptied.
Another rumour was that 100 people had been struck with the mystery illness
at the World Trade Centre building in the centre of Guangzhou, escalating
fears of legionella or even bioterrorism. The centre's managers responded
by disinfecting the whole building, and they subsequently vaporised white
vinegar through its ventilation system.
It was not until Tue 11 Feb 2003 that an official statement was made by the
Guangdong Department of Health. In the interim it had been very difficult
for doctors and other health professionals to respond to the barrage of
inquiries. The officials announced that the first case had occurred in
November 2002, but as it was common for influenza-like infections to
afflict the community in the winter months, there had been no undue concern.
To date there have been 345 cases in 8 cities throughout Guangdong (which
has a population of 80 million), but the number of new cases is declining.

[This article mentions a total of 345 cases in 8 cities throughout
Guangdong with an associated 7 deaths, an increase in numbers of cases and
deaths from earlier newswires we have posted on ProMED-mail (see references
below). What this article also mentions is the power of rumor-mongering
that goes along with "unknown" etiology outbreaks. The statement "In the
absence of public statements and official information the media
communicated very little" may refer to the local media, but on the
international level, the media were rife with articles on the outbreak,
many of which would be better characterized as rumor mongering than real
information exchange. This is a reminder of the need for official sources
to report information on outbreaks and findings of outbreak investigations
sooner rather than later. In today's environment, with increased
telecommunications worldwide, combined with heightened concerns about
bioterrorism, news of disease outbreaks travels much faster and more widely
than in the past. - Mod.MPP]
