In Thailand, a disease contracted from rat urine has killed at least 182
people and infected more than 5 000. Thailand's Health Ministry says the
high toll has been caused by heavy flooding, which makes conditions more
hospitable for the bacteria which [cause the disease.
The Ministry says the strain of the disease in Thailand appears to be more
dangerous than that found in other countries. Symptoms include influenza,
fever, aching muscles, chills and often jaundice and nausea. Transmission
is through the skin or by ingesting food or water contaminated with
infected urine.

[GIDEON data previously posted on ProMED-mail indicate that _Leptospira
interrogans_ serovar. bataviae predominates in Bangkok, and serovar.
autumnalis in rural areas. These outbreaks occur with some regularity
during periods of flooding in Thailand, but this year's caseload appears to
be higher than usual. - Mod.ES
