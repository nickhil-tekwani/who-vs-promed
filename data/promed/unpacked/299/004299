Guetersloh district: avian flu not yet overcome
-----------------------------------------------
LPAI [low pathogenic avian influenza] has been found again in
Guetersloh, namely in birds on 2 holdings, which tested positive for
LPAI H7N7. The outbreaks occurred on a farm with 4500 laying hens and
a holding with turkeys for fattening.

Since the 1st confirmation of LPAI, 10 holdings have tested positive
and the number of birds killed and disposed of is more than 90 000
(including the latest holdings affected).

[The recent H7N7 spread in Germany started in the Guetersloh
district, Northrhine-Westphalia (NW), on 23 May 2011. Germany notified
the outbreak to the OIE, and subsequently notified 9 additional
outbreaks in 4 follow-up reports. A summary, as of 20 Jun 2011, with
an interactive map, is available at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=10633.
In June, 2 contact holdings to one of the holdings tested positive for
LPAI H7N7 in Guetersloh, were found infected outside NW state, namely
in Baden-Wurttemberg (south west, near the Swiss and French borders)
and in Bavaria (central-east); OIE notification and map are available
at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=10714.

Germany's neighbour on the north west, the Netherlands, notified the
OIE on 13 May 2011 of an LPAI H7N7 outbreak in Gelderland, affecting
free range laying hens (20110515.1479); map at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=10580.

On 24 Jun 2011, the Netherlands notified the OIE of a LPAI H7N7
outbreak in Flevoland, similarly affecting free range laying hens;
notification with map at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=10739.
In both cases, similarly to Germany, stamping out and quarantine
measures were applied in line with EU requirements. - Mod.AS]
