Graziers in Southern Queensland are urged to vaccinate their livestock against anthrax following another case near St George, a year since about 80 head died on a local property.

Minister for Agricultural Industry Development Mark Furner said only a small number of cattle had died in the recent case. "Our officers moved quickly to contain the disease on that individual property by immediately restricting all movement of livestock on and off that location," he said. "The owners undertook vaccination of all remaining cattle to minimise the risk of further spread."

Biosecurity Queensland's Chief Veterinary Officer Allison Crook said the property was no longer under movement restrictions. "This incident indicates that anthrax spores may be present in and around the St George district and livestock grazing locally may be at risk of infection," she said.

The previous outbreak was reported on 3 Mar 2017. When 80 animals die from anthrax I think one can confidently assume that there will be a measure of soil contamination. Therefore I am puzzled that come the following Spring, October-November 2017, why the stock were not re-vaccinated and ditto the livestock on the adjoining farms. The immunity from anthrax vaccination is short lasting, barely a year. Natural immunity from clinical exposure is also short, a few years. Both humans & livestock are known to suffer the disease if re-exposed. Considering the probable level of soil contamination on the index farm, re-vaccination for 6-7 years would be a good decision to start with; and if I were a neighbour I would do the same.
