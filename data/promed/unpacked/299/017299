Borna virus occurs mainly in Bavaria. In the Rottal-Inn, a woman became infected with the life-threatening pathogen. The risk of infection is low, but the consequences of the disease transmitted by shrews are serious.

What else is known?
Perhaps the virus never left the district of Rottal-Inn, it is difficult to say for sure with this rare and mysterious pathogen. One thing is certain: the Borna virus is here. In the western part of the district, an infection with the life-threatening Borna disease virus 1 -- BoDV-1 for short -- was detected recently. The sick woman is currently being treated in a hospital outside the district, said a spokesperson for the SZ district office. No further information can be given at the moment, one is in contact with the responsible authorities.

The most recent Borna virus case is the 3rd known this year [2022] in Bavaria. That sounds insignificant, is little, and is nevertheless striking: Of the approximately 40 BoDV-1 infections that have been detected in humans nationwide in recent years, more than 90 percent can be located in the Free State of Bavaria. The district of Mühldorf is also considered a risk area. At the beginning of August [2022], a child died of an infection in Maitenbeth, it was the 2nd death in the small town since 2019. The virus causes encephalitis in humans, a severe brain inflammation that often ends fatally.

The State Office for Health and Food Safety (LGL) assesses the risk of infection as low: according to the current state of knowledge, transmission of BoDV-1 to humans is very rare. In 2021, a total of 7 people in Germany were infected with the Borna virus, and 5 of them came from Bavaria. Experts are nevertheless puzzled by the pathogen that causes Borna disease. It actually causes animal diseases, and in the 19th century, it killed numerous cavalry horses in Borna, Saxony. However, the 1st BoDV-1 infection in humans was only detected in 2018. Accordingly, research into this zoonosis is still in its infancy, and a trend in the number of infections cannot be read off "due to the short observation period", according to the LGL. Outside Germany, other, smaller endemic areas are only found in Austria, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein.

The field shrew, which lives in fallow land, gardens, and fields, is considered the vector. As a so-called reservoir host, it probably does not contract the virus [disease] itself but excretes it [the virus] via saliva, urine, and faeces. It is not yet known exactly how the virus is transmitted from animals to humans. It is at least conceivable that people could become infected through direct contact with the shrew or its droppings, writes the Rottal-Inn District Office in a statement. "Furthermore, transmission could also occur via contaminated food, water or inhalation of contaminated dust." Dead shrews should therefore only be removed with rubber gloves and FFP2 masks, contaminated surfaces should be cleaned with household cleaner.

Not only does the rarity of the virus make it difficult to diagnose, but the symptoms are also rather unspecific at the beginning. "A large proportion of those known to have contracted BoDV-1 suffered from headaches, fever, and a general feeling of illness at the beginning," says an information page of the LGL. Only later did behavioural problems, speech and gait disorders, and severe brain inflammation develop. Of all the people known to have contracted the disease so far, only 3 survived "with severe consequential damage".

Several projects are currently underway to find out more about the virus. Above all, Maitenbeth and its approximately 2000 inhabitants are the focus of research interest: The Friedrich Loeffler Institute as the Federal Research Institute for Animal Health is investigating the local shrew population. At the end of July [2022], the LGL and the University Hospital Regensburg asked volunteers to take blood samples and nasal swabs in the multi-purpose hall. The samples will be tested for BoDV-1 antibodies, among other things, similar to what is known from Coronavirus, in order to detect any unknown infections and draw conclusions about the spread of the virus. Results are expected in autumn.

[Bavaria is again the focus of Borna virus infections this year (2022). Cases of Bornavirus disease occur sporadically in Germany and have been diagnosed in Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and Austria. A 2018 article in the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control provides a good overview of the Borna disease virus (BoDV) complex and the disease BoDV-1 can cause in animals and its association with disease in humans (see Borna virus - Germany: fatal 20180328.5714656).

"Main conclusions and options for response" in the article follow:

"Borna disease virus 1 (BoDV-1) has been associated with human disease in 4 cases in Germany resulting in the deatsh of 3 people. As 3 of the cases belong to a cluster of solid organ recipients from a single donor, donor-derived BoDV-1 transmission is possible. There is no evidence that the donor had any clinical manifestation of the disease.

"BoDV-1 in humans occurs rarely; however considering the severity of this disease, Member States may consider adding BoDV-1 to the list of pathogens included in the differential diagnosis of causes of human encephalitis. The fact that the virus could be transmitted through solid organ transplantation raises concerns about the possibility of transmission through other types of substances of human origin (SoHO). This should be further investigated.

"Clinicians and transplantation professionals should be aware of possible BoDV-1 related encephalitis and the possibility of transmission through donated organs, especially in areas where Borna disease is endemic. Endemic areas so far have been identified in central Europe including eastern and southern Germany, the eastern part of Switzerland, Liechtenstein, the most western federal state of Austria and more recently in Upper Austria.

"The bicoloured, white-toothed shrew (_Crocidura leucodon_) has been proposed as the animal reservoir of BoDV-1. The routes of transmission of BoDV-1 to humans from the animal reservoir remain unknown and the zoonotic transmission pathways should be further investigated."
