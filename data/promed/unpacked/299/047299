Cases of hand, foot and mouth disease virus Infection in Daycares
-----------------------------------------------------------------
A total of 5 to 10 cases of hand, foot and mouth disease virus
infection have been reported at area daycares, Waco physician Dr. Tim
Martindale confirmed on Thu 27 Oct 2011. This common virus usually
affects infants and children younger than 5, although it can sometimes
occur in adults. Symptoms include sores in the mouth and a skin rash
along with congestion, fever and body aches.

It typically runs its course in 3 to 5 days, Martindale said. The best
defense against the virus is frequent hand washing and avoidance of
close contact such as kissing, hugging or sharing eating utensils with
those who have the disease.

It shouldn't be confused with foot and mouth disease, which affects
cattle, pigs and sheep, but not humans.

[Large outbreaks of hand, foot, and mouth disease are not common in
the United States, and the disease is rarely reported. However, in
some countries in Asia, outbreaks are large and occur often. Thousands
of people may get infected during these outbreaks. Some people,
particularly young children, may have severe disease requiring
hospitalization or even causing death.

Hand, foot, and mouth disease is caused by several different viruses
classified in the genus _Enterovirus_, which comprises the
polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and enteroviruses.
Coxsackievirus A16 has been the most common cause of hand, foot and
mouth disease in the United States, but other coxsackieviruses have
been associated with the illness. Currently in several Asian countries
enterovirus 71 is associated with more severe forms of hand, foot and
mouth disease.

The current outbreak in Texas appears to be dispersed and affecting
relatively few children. A detailed account of hand, foot and mouth
disease can be obtained from the CDC website at:
