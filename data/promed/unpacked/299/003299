Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Virus - WHO Update 66
-----------------------------------------------------
Weekly update:
--------------
In the temperate regions* of the northern hemisphere, influenza
activity remains widely variable. In North America, the United States
is reporting increases in influenza-like-illness activity above the
seasonal baseline, most notably in the southern, southeastern, and
parts of the northeastern United States.

In Canada, influenza activity remains low. In Europe and Central Asia
influenza activity remains low overall, except in France, which is
reporting increases in influenza-like-illness activity (for week 37)
above the seasonal epidemic threshold. Geographically localized
influenza activity is being reported in several countries (Austria,
Georgia, Ireland, Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal, the Czech Republic,
Cyprus, and Israel). In Japan, influenza activity remains stably
increased above the seasonal epidemic threshold with the most notable
increases being reported on the southern island of Okinawa.

In the tropical regions of the Americas and Asia, influenza
transmission remains active. Geographically regional to widespread
influenza activity continues to be reported throughout much of South
and Southeast Asia, with increasing trends in respiratory diseases
being reported in India and Bangladesh. Geographically regional to
widespread influenza activity continues to be reported for the
tropical regions of Central and South America without a consistent
pattern in the trend of respiratory diseases (continued increases are
being reported in Bolivia and Venezuela).

In the temperate regions* of the southern hemisphere, influenza
activity continues to decrease or has returned to the seasonal
baseline in most countries. In Australia, later affected areas are
also now reporting declining levels of influenza-like-illness. In
South Africa, influenza activity appears to have recently passed over
the 2nd peak (the 1st peak was due to seasonal influenza A (H3N2) and
2nd peak was due to pandemic (H1N1) 2009).

WHO Collaborating Centres and other laboratories continue to report
sporadic isolates of oseltamivir resistant influenza virus; 26 such
virus isolates have now been described from around the world, all of
which carry the same H275Y mutation that confers resistance to the
antiviral oseltamivir but not to the antiviral zanamivir. Of these, 12
have been associated with post-exposure prophylaxis, 5 with long term
oseltamivir treatment in patients with immunosuppression. Worldwide,
more than 10 000 clinical samples and isolates of the pandemic (H1N1)
2009 virus have been tested and found to be sensitive to oseltamivir.
WHO will continue to monitor the situation closely in collaboration
with its partners.

Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus continues to be the predominant
circulating influenza virus, both in the northern and southern
hemisphere. See below for detailed laboratory surveillance update.

*Countries in temperate regions are defined as those north of the
Tropic of Cancer or south of the Tropic of Capricorn, while countries
in tropical regions are defined as those between these 2 latitudes.

Weekly update (Virological surveillance data):
----------------------------------------------
As of 18 Sep 2009, since since the beginning of the pandemic (from 19
Apr to 5 Sep 2009), a total of 80 countries reported to FluNet**. The
total number of specimens reported positive for influenza viruses by
National Influenza Centres (NICs) was 105 002. Of these, 62 719 (59.7
percent) were pandemic H1N1, 5899 (5.6 percent) were seasonal A (H1),
15 284 (14.6 percent) were A (H3), 17 313 (16.5 percent) were A (Not
subtyped) and 3782 (3.6 percent) were influenza B.

For this reporting week (30 Aug to 5 Sep 2009), a total of 31
countries reported to FluNet. Total number of specimens reported
positive for influenza viruses by NICs was 7495. Of these, 4317 (57.6
percent) were pandemic H1N1, 283 (3.8 percent) were seasonal A (H1),
1612 (21.5 percent) were A (H3), 1167 (15.6 percent) were A (Not
subtyped), 116 (1.5 percent) were influenza B. On average, the
pandemic A (H1N1) accounted for 58 percent of all flu detections (57
percent in northern hemisphere and 94 percent in southern hemisphere).

All pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza viruses analysed to date have been
antigenically and genetically similar to A/California/7/2009-like
pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus.

Region / Cumulative total as of 13 Sep 2009 / Cases** / Deaths

WHO Regional Office for Africa (AFRO) / 8125 / 40
WHO Regional Office for the Americas (AMRO) / 124126 / 2625
WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean (EMRO) / 10533 / 61
WHO Regional Office for Europe (EURO) / over 52000 / at least 140
WHO Regional Office for South-East Asia (SEARO) / 25339 / 283
WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific (WPRO) / 76348 / 337

Total / over 296471 / at least 3486

**Given that countries are no longer required to test and report
individual cases, the number of cases reported actually understates
the real number of cases.
