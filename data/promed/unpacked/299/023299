On 1 Dec 2015, Miluo Center for Disease Control received a laboratory report from Yueyang showing that of 3 water samples sent from Miluo, 1 was found positive for H7N9 avian influenza. This is the 1st positive sample found in the area of Yueyang City in 2015.

On 23 Nov 2015, Miluo took 3 samples from the outside environment and sent them to Yueyang for testing.

On 1 Dec 2015, Miluo Center for Disease Control received the news that of the 3 samples sent for testing, 1 water sample from Miluo Zhongxin Jimao Market was found positive. Zhu Xinchun of Miluo Center said that H7N9 virus found in the environment means that birds kept in the area could be infected.

"But for now we haven't found any human cases of H7N9 infection" said Zhu Xinchun.

[The zoonotic H7N9 virus strain responsible for human infections in China has been reported from Eastern China since March 2013, circulating mostly in live poultry markets. This virus strain is of low pathogenicity in poultry (LPAI H7N9), which means the disease symptoms in birds are slight or absent, i.e., subclinical. The birds are, in fact, the reservoir of the virus without becoming sick, their being infected discovered only by tests applied to apparently healthy animals, or -- as seen multiple times -- following human infection, humans playing the unfortunate role of virus sentinels.

The occurrence of H7N9 in humans in China has a seasonal pattern, peaking in winter months. Reportedly, the case fatality rate in humans is above 25 percent.

China's final report (No 18) to the OIE on H7N9 was submitted on 31 Aug 2015, when the outbreak was declare "resolved", with no additional reports to be submitted. Links to all reports and an interactive map showing all "outbreaks", most of them discovered in live animal markets, not on farms, since the start of the event in Apr 2013, is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=13225.

OIE's Q&A on LPAI H7N9 is available at http://www.oie.int/en/for-the-media/press-releases/detail/article/questions-and-answers-on-influenza-ah7n9/. China's Ministry of Agriculture LPAI H7N9 information is available in Chinese at http://www.moa.gov.cn/sjzz/syj/dwyqdt/. - Mod.AS
