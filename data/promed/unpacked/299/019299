The Plateau State Commissioner for Health, Dr Kuden Deyin on [Tue 25 Jul 2017] confirmed another case of Lassa fever in the state.

Deyin who made the confirmation to our correspondent in Jos, said the patient who was brought-in from Garkawa in Mikang Local Government Area was displaying symptoms of Lassa fever.

"After blood sample was taken from the patient, the result came out positive and the patient is currently responding to treatment at the Jos University Teaching Hospital (JUTH).

"The state has so far recorded 4 cases of Lassa fever and 3 out of the 4 patients are responding to treatment at the Jos University Teaching Hospital while one patient died,'' he said.

The commissioner advised the public to ensure that they maintain a very high standard of personal hygiene and ensure that their environments are kept clean.

"Food stuffs should be kept in rodent-proof containers and people should also desist from drying their food stuffs on the highway, as they never can tell when rats will defecate or urinate on them.

"Health workers should be on the alert while private medical practitioners are advised not to keep patients who manifest symptoms of Lassa fever for long. Rather such patients should be referred to tertiary health institutions for prompt medical attention as time was of the essence in treating Lassa fever,'' the commissioner said.

On [Sat 8 Jul 2017], students from Federal Government Girls College, were rushed from the school clinic to the Jos University Teaching Hospital and it was observed that they were displaying symptoms of Lassa fever.

Their blood samples were taken to Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH) were it was discovered that 3 out of the 4 samples were positive.

Lassa fever, also known as Lassa hemorrhagic fever (LHF), is a type of viral hemorrhagic fever caused by the Lassa virus. Many of those infected by the virus do not develop symptoms.

When symptoms occur they typically include fever, weakness, headaches, vomiting, and muscle pains.

The virus is commonly transmitted by rats and is said to be responsible for about 5000 deaths every year.

Recently the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) alerted Nigerians on the need to raise their guard against another outbreak of Lassa fever and Ebola.

Dr Tunde Olawepo, the Chairman of the association in Kwara told our correspondent in an interview that Nigeria must not let down its guard against the deadly viruses, Ebola and Lassa fever.

According to him, surveillance of travellers entering the country has stopped just as people had relaxed with personal hygiene like regular washing of hands and use of sanitizers. "People have stopped using hand sanitizers and frequent hand washing as before. We need to step up with preventive measures and this means people must keep up with hygiene at all times," he said.

[Cases have increased by 3, confirmed cases by 3 and deaths by one in the past week.

Once again, ProMED thanks Dr Olutayo Olajide Babalobi for sending in the Epidemiological Report above. - Mod.TY]

[As noted in earlier comments, Lassa fever remains a problem in Nigeria because the virus is endemic there. Virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or their excreta. Transmission also occurs in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed and barrier-nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients.

Images of _Mastomys_ mice, the rodent reservoir of Lass fever virus, can be seen at http://www.ispot.org.za/node/255877.
