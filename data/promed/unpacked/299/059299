Chocolate spot threat
---------------------
Further reports have been received of chocolate spot symptoms in
winter bean crops, says PGRO [Processors and Growers Research
Organisation]. This is the result of the harsh winter predisposing the
plants to disease. Damage is mainly on older leaves, showing up as
blackened areas, with more typical chocolate spot symptoms tending to
be on the younger leaves.

Fungicides for chocolate spot control are protectant and so will not
cure existing disease but as soon as new growth becomes more apparent
over the next 2 or 3 weeks, and where chocolate spot is developing on
the new growth, a fungicide application will provide protection for
new foliage, says PGRO.

[Chocolate spot caused by the fungus _Botrytis fabae_ or the more
virulent _B. cinerea_ is an important disease of broad bean (_Vicia
faba_; also called winter bean, horse bean, Windsor bean, field bean,
faba bean) and other leguminous crops. For example, it is one of the
most destructive diseases of pulses in tropical African regions. _B.
fabae_ is prevalent throughout the season, while _B. cinerea_ affects
crops intermittently and is usually confined to flowering time.

Symptoms start as brown spots on lower leaves, and this is considered
the 'non-aggressive' phase thought to have little effect on crop
yield. However, if warm, humid conditions persist for several days,
the disease will spread quickly and be termed 'aggressive' with
symptoms of leaf blight, defoliation, and loss of flowers and pods.
Stems can weaken and collapse, and flowers and pods may also develop
lesions although affected seeds are still edible. A plant toxin
produced by the pathogens is thought to be responsible for the damage
to the host tissue.

A strong relationship exists between disease incidence and seed
yield, with an average of 3 percent yield loss per percent of crop
infection for _B. c._ and 0.5 percent loss per percent of _B. f._
infection. Disease management includes cultural and phytosanitary
measures (such as burning of plant residue at the end of cropping,
wide spacing of plants, limiting the amounts of nitrogenous
fertilisers, crop rotation), use of clean seed, control of volunteer
crop plants, and fungicides. Host cultivars with varying levels of
tolerance are being developed.
