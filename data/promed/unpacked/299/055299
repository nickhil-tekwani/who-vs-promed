Re: ProMED mail Avian influenza (22): Japan (AI) LPNAI H7N6 1st
report 20090306.0927
----------------------------------------------------------------------
I refer to the text of the posting above stating the following:
"According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries,
the first H7N6 infection was reported in 1981 in Australia in chickens."

Outbreaks in Australia occurred in 1976, 1985, 1992, 1994, and 1997
(none in 1981).

In none of the outbreaks or any subsequent investigations was H7N6
found in chickens.
1976 - H7N7
1985 - H7N7
1992 - H7N3
1994 - H7N3
1997 - H7N4

[George Arzey's observation refers to H7N6 "not found in chickens" in
Australia. It may be assumed that the Japanese Ministry of
Agriculture's media-cited comment on the apparent first reported H7N6
in chickens from Australia may have been based upon the following
Australian reference, published in 1981, which dealt with (earlier)
H7N6 isolates from ducks and chickens:

Westbury HA, Turner AJ, Amon L (Department of Agriculture, Attwood
Veterinary Research Laboratory, Westmeadows, Victoria, Australia):
Transmissibility of two avian influenza a viruses (H7N6) between
chickens. Avian Pathol 1981 Oct; 10(4): 481-7.

Abstract
--------
"Differences were demonstrated in the transmissibility of 2 strains
of avian influenza virus among chickens. One strain,
A/duck/Victoria/76 (H7N6) spread quickly and infected all incontact
chickens, whereas A/chicken/Victoria/75 (H7N6) spread slowly and
failed to infect all incontact chickens. These strains were isolated
in the same locality at about the same time in a region where the
viruses, and the disease fowl plague, had not been previously recognized."

A clarification from the commenting Japanese authorities and/or
Australian authors will help in straightening out this (mere
history/chronology) issue. - Mod.AS]
