Scientists of St. Petersburg's Smorodintsev Research Institute of Influenza have conducted a genetic study of the SARS-CoV-2 virus detected in a cat for the 1st time [sic; see comment] in Russia, discovering that the strain is identical to the one circulating in Russia, the institute reported on Thursday [14 Jan 2021].

"Within the framework of the Coronavirus Russian Genetic Initiative (CoRGI), scientists of the Smorodintsev Research Institute of Influenza of the Russian Healthcare Ministry conducted the 1st Russian genetic study of the SARS-CoV-2 virus detected in a domestic cat," the statement on the institute's VKontakte page said.

According to the institute, owners of the domestic animal, who earlier had had mild COVID-19 signs, were the most likely source of the infection. The animal had an elevated body temperature, became apathetic, and lost its appetite. The institute's specialists together with veterinarians of the Burlakov clinic took swabs of the animal's mucous lining of the larynx and nasal cavity, where the coronavirus was detected.

"Pathogens isolated in the owner and the cat are practically identical. The sequenced strains demonstrated that they belong to the most common GR clade circulating in Russia and do not carry any specific deviation from viruses obtained earlier from the infected patients. Currently, the animal is in a stable condition; the appetite has returned, and the pet is recovering," the institute noted.

The institute also added that cases of the infection of pets have been noted since the very beginning of the 2020 pandemic. Cats endure the infection with varying degrees of severity, and in the absolute majority of recorded cases, the animal recovers.

According to the institute, taking into account that cases of novel coronavirus infection among pets are highly rare, it is still possible to assert that, in all cases, the owners remain the single source of the infection, while the animals themselves can neither transmit the virus to other pets nor to their owners [see comment].

[Russia reported its 1st lab-confirmed COVID-19 case in a cat in May 2020 (20200526.7379578). Human-to-cat COVID-19 infections, involving housed domestic cats, are likely to be more common than reported, occurring globally. Probably, and as apparent from serological surveillance (Wuhan, 20200403.7179946) and experimental infection trials, most such infections remain subclinical. Under experimental conditions, inoculated cats infected cohabiting cats. No case of cat-to-human COVID-19 infection has been known to occur so far.

For a paper addressing a recent experimental infection trial in cats carried out by the University of Wisconsin - Madison School of Veterinary Medicine, Wisconsin, USA, please refer to Ref 1.
