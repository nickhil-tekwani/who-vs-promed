Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome - Chile (comment) 970926232810]
I spoke with one of my former students, Eduardo Palma, who is a mammalogist
in Chile, and he tells me the increase in _Oligoryzomys_ sp. densities is
believed to be due to the flowering and resulting primary production of
bamboo. Other plants may also be secondarily involved. This situation is
analogous to other hantavirus outbreaks in other countries. If true it
will be hard to blame this one on Argentina.

[A rose is a rose is a rose, but it is not true that a rat is a rat is a
rat. See my comments in "Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome - Chile (comment),
archive 970926232810". We had heard this bamboo:_Oligoryzomys_ story
previously but have not, until now, been able to post it. Seems the
explosive flowering of bamboo might be related to a changed weather
pattern, perhaps another result of the El Nino/Southern Oscillation effect.
One can kill all the shipboard rats one wants and not affect the
population of _Oligoryzomys_ (the ostensible vertebrate host of the Chilean
hantavirus) if they are not on ships. -- Mod CHC]
