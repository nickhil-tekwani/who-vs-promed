More than 200 goats have died in the village "Torrit Ekarkaren" from Targua n'touchka in Chtouka Ait Baha province, over the past few days and the reasons are still unknown.

According to the owner of the dead herd, the incident caused a financial, environmental, and sanitary disaster. The foul smells and stray dogs that gather at the place where these dead animals were disposed of, threaten the safety of the citizens.

Hespress newspaper learned that the local authority had previously informed the veterinary services of the incident. A unit moved to the place where samples were taken to conduct laboratory analysis to determine the cause of the deaths of the large number of goats.

[Any available information on the event, in particular results of the investigation by the veterinary services, including laboratory tests applied and their results, will be appreciated. It will be interesting to note if the death of the animals was sudden/acute or preceded by a period of illness/clinical signs.

In juvenile goats, sudden mortality could be attributed to infectious or non-infectious etiologies, such as enterotoxaemia (_Cloridia_ spp) and FMD virus. Though being a remote risk, Rift valley fever, a pathogen which may kill young ruminants, hitherto not reported from Morocco, deserves exclusion as well, in view of its reported past circulation in neighbouring Mauritania. Other etiologies to be considered, in all age groups, include anthrax and various toxic agents, among others.
