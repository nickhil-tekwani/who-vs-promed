Kroger Co, the largest USA grocery chain, is recalling a bean salad sold at
its deli counters in 14 states because of potential contamination that
might cause botulism in consumers. The tri-bean salad was sold in Ohio,
Kentucky, Indiana, Colorado, Illinois, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri,
Nebraska, New Mexico, Utah, Washington, West Virginia, and Wyoming, Kroger
said in a statement.

The beans were sold to Kroger by New Era Canning Co, which issued an
earlier voluntary recall of all canned green beans and garbanzo beans
produced in the last 5 years, because they might be contaminated with germs
that cause botulism, the FDA [US Food and Drug Administration] said on its
website.

Kroger, based in Cincinnati, said no illnesses have been reported, and
other salad products weren't affected by the recall, according to the
statement.

[Additional recalls like this one may occur among the recipients of the
institutional-sized cans of beans. Because of the potential severity of
botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there
are no human cases associated with the food. Most of the food recalls are
related to defective preparation procedures which could, but do not
necessarily, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium
botulinum_. However, during the original part of this recall, it was stated
that the organism was indeed identified. - Mod.LL]
