More than 130 goats died in a month in Kuradposhi village under Reamal block in the district [Debagarh district, Odisha state]. The goats died allegedly after being injected with vaccine to prevent peste des petits ruminants (PPR) disease by the district veterinary department. The PPR disease is an acute viral disease of goats and sheep characterised by fever, stomatitis, gastro-enteritis and pneumonia. With several villagers in goat and sheep rearing, the veterinary officials had administered vaccine to prevent the disease among the animals in July [2016]. Villagers alleged that after the animals were injected by the vaccine, they started dying.

The villagers said after the goats began dying one after another, they informed veterinary officials but none turned up nor paid any attention to the deaths. RP, who lost 19 goats, said the entire village depends on goat farming for a living. The deaths of goats have pushed them back into poverty, he added. However, Chief District Veterinary Officer Dr Rabi Narayan Behera feigned ignorance about the incident and admitted that vaccine was administered on goats across the district to prevent PPR. He assured to inquire into the incident with Block Veterinary Officer on Friday [26 Aug 2016].

[The report does not include data on the clinical signs, the duration of illness and the age distribution among the (around 130) affected goats. In addition, the number and age distribution among the animals remaining unaffected in the village's vaccinated flocks are requested, as well as confirmation that no disease has affected unvaccinated and animals of other species kept on the same premises. It will also be interesting to note if the same vaccine batch has been applied in other locations and if similar cases have been recorded elsewhere.

In the past, live-attenuated rinderpest vaccine was applied for the vaccination of small ruminants against PPR. This application of such vaccine has been banned worldwide since the global eradication of rinderpest; only homologous, live-attenuated PPR vaccines are permitted and currently applied. The requirements for such vaccines, particularly addressing their testing for efficacy and safety, are laid out in OIE's Manual, chapter 2.7.10 "Peste des petits ruminants (Infection with peste des petits ruminants virus)", available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.07.10_PPR.pdf. The seed should be controlled and tested free from bacterial, fungus and mycoplasma contamination. It should be tested free from pestivirus and any other known extraneous virus. Each batch of the final product is required to undergo prescribed safety tests.

PPR is endemic in India. The most recent OIE-reported outbreaks (10) in Orissa (Odisha) occurred during the 1st semester of 2012. - Mod.AS
