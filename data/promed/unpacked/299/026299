Viet Nam was once a hotbed of avian flu -- and human H5N1 infections -- but it has been more than 4 years since the last human case was confirmed in that country [see WHO Chart at URL above], and outbreaks in poultry -- while they still occur -- have been greatly subdued. Despite this remarkable success story, over the past few years 2 new avian threats have been added to the mix, which have raised concerns.

During the summer of 2014, shortly after China reported their 1st H5N6 fatality in Sichuan Province, Viet Nam began to report scattered outbreaks in poultry. Since then, China has reported nearly 2 dozen human cases, but thus far Viet Nam has only seen the virus in poultry.

Although China has largely controlled their H7N9 crisis, the virus has been reported several times near the border with Viet Nam -- and there are serious concerns it could turn up in Viet Nam (see China's Nervous Neighbors https://afludiary.blogspot.com/2017/03/chinas-nervous-neighbors.html). And last year's [2018] one-off human infection with H7N4 (see Jiangsu China Reports 1st Novel H7N4 Human Infection http://afludiary.blogspot.com/2018/02/jiangsu-china-reports-1st-novel-h7n4.html) is just the latest in a long line of examples proving that nature's laboratory continues to come up with new novel flu threats.

This week is the Lunar New Year. In Viet Nam, it is called Tet Nguyen Dan or Feast of the First Morning, or Tet for short. During this time, millions of Asians will travel home for traditional family gatherings, taking part in the largest annual human migration on earth.

As always, with this much intermixing of people, and traveling -- often in crowded conveyances -- we worry about the carriage and transmission of communicable diseases. Avian flu is often mentioned, but there are other common threats as well, including measles, mumps, and seasonal flu, for example.

Although it may well turn out to be something far less exotic, overnight there are multiple reports in the Vietnamese press of 2 patients admitted with severe pneumonia who are being tested for avian flu at the Bach Mai Hospital in Hanoi.

Typical of the reporting is this translated report, from the VN Express [Fri 8 Feb 2019 15:35 (GMT+7)]:

"Two people with severe pneumonia are suspected to be infected with bird flu. These are 2 suspected cases after many years without detecting any cases of influenza A (H5N1) infection.

"According to a quick report of the Ministry of Health, on [6 Feb 2019], the 2nd Lunar New Year, Bach Mai Hospital (Hanoi) recorded 2 people with severe pneumonia suspected of being infected with dangerous bird flu.

"These 2 cases are being investigated by the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology and samples [have been taken] for testing. Results will be available in the next few days.

"According to the Department of Animal Health, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, there is no outbreak of avian influenza in poultry in the country, but it does not exclude the possibility that avian influenza appears [in] humans."

Although Viet Nam's recent history suggests these cases are something other than avian flu, 6 years ago this month [February 2013] we were watching 3 pneumonia cases in Eastern China that more than a month later were announced to be the 1st human cases of H7N9.

So we remain ever vigilant, just in case.

[ProMED thanks Viki Hansen-Landis for this contribution. It is not clear from the blog post which avian influenza subtype is suspected in these human cases, although the mention of the Ministry of Heath report indicates that some admitted cases are being investigated.

Any further updates on epidemiological data and laboratory confirmation of the cases would be highly appreciated. - Mod.UBA
