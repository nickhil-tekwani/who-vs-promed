Russia: Six people in Rostov Region contract West Nile fever
------------------------------------------------------------
Six people contracted West Nile fever infection, a rare and dangerous
disease, in the Rostov Region (Oblast) in 2006. All the cases have
been recorded between the end of August and mid September [2006]. The
affected patients stated that they spent their spare time in the
country-side near water. Laboratory studies indicated that infection
had been contract through the bite of blood-sucking insects. The
Deputy Director of the Rostov Regional Center for Hygiene and
Epidemiology, Pavel Savchenko, stated that West Nile virus infection
can affect internal organs. Signs of general intoxication and
meningoencephalitis may be observed and the extent of this determines
the outcome of infection. Mortality from West Nile fever may be 4 to
11 percent. West Nile fever was recorded first some 6 years ago in
the Volgograd and Astrakhan Regions. Infection has now reached the
Rostov Region by migrant birds, rodents and mosquitoes.

[West Nile fever has been endemic in the Volgograd and Astrakhan
Regions since 1999. During the last 6-7 years single cases and
outbreaks of this disease have been reported in the Rostov Region
(Oblast). The lower regions of the river Don provide nesting sites
for huge number of waterfowl, and migrant birds are the source of
infection. The vectors are mosquitoes. There are many cases of
disease especially during hot summers, when additional generations of
mosquitoes may be observed. Possibly the same scenario applied this
year. A risk awareness campaign needs to be implemented since the
general population has no immunity and no vaccine has been approved
for use in humans. - ProMED RUS Corr.VM].
[Cases of West Nile fever in the territory of South Federal Area are
not uncommon. The disease has been recorded in the Rostov, Astrakhan,
Volgograd, Krasnodar and Stavrapol Regions. During 2005, 15 people
contracted West Nile fever in the Rostov Region, whereas so far there
have been only 6 cases in the region. The largest outbreak of
infection was recorded in the in Astrakhan Region in 2005, where 75
people contracted infection and 2 died. The actual number of cases of
West Nile fever in South Russia may be greater. It may be the [virus]
was present before 1999 but appropriate diagnostic laboratory tests
were not available.
The Rostov-on-Don Region is located in the southern part of the
East-European plateau and partly in the North Caucasian region,
covering a vast territory in the basin of the Don River and coastline
of Taganrog Bay in the Sea of Azov. The distance between Moscow and
Rostov-on-Don is 1226 km. The region occupies an area of 100.9
thousand sq. km, that is 0.6 percent of the territory of Russia. It
borders on Stavropol and Krasnodar territories in the south, Ukraine
in the west and northwest, Voronezh Region in the north, Volgograd
Region in the northeast and east, and the Republic of Kalmykia in the
east, southeast, and south. - ProMED-RUS Mod. NP].
[West Nile virus infection of humans and mammals (horses in
particular) throughout its African and Eurasian ranges is sporadic
and infrequent, in contrast to its recent epodemic progression
through North America. But significant outbreaks have occurred such
as in the Astrakhan Region of the Southern Federal District of Russia
in 2005. According to a previous ProMED-mail post -- West Nile virus
- Russia 20051106.3246 -- in the outbreak in the Volgograd, Rostov
and Astrakhan regions of the southern Federal district of Russia in
the late summer of 2005 at least 150 people fell ill with West Nile
fever and 36 died (see:
<http://www.rian.ru/analytics/20051031/41945669.html>). An epidemic
in Romania involved hundreds of human cases with 17 fatalities, and
sporadic West Nile virus cases have been recorded in Israel over
several years. Recently outbreaks have occurred in horses in France
and Italy. West Nile virus-seropositive birds have been recorded in
Poland, the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom. - Mod.CP]
