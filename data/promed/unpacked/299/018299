The discovery of whirling disease in Rocky View County's (RVC) Lott Creek [Alberta] on [6 Oct 2016] marks the 1st time the disease has been spotted outside of Banff National Park. According to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), whirling disease poses "no risk" to human health or food safety.

"Whirling disease is an infectious disease of finfish," said Tammy Jarbeau, media relations with CFIA, in an email to Rocky View Weekly. "To date, there has been one confirmed case of whirling disease in water bodies in RVC, upstream from the confluence of Lott Creek and the Elbow River."

According to Jarbeau, trout and mountain whitefish found in Alberta are susceptible to infection, but may not always show signs of the disease. Affected fish may exhibit a whirling swimming pattern, display skeletal deformities of the body or head, or have a tail that appears darker or even black.

"Whirling disease can be spread by moving finfish, bait, contaminated equipment, or contaminated water," she said.

"People can control the spread of whirling disease by cleaning equipment between uses and avoid transporting those items from one body of water to another."

The disease was initially detected late August [2016] in Johnson Lake in Banff National Park. 7 more cases have since been confirmed in the park but this is the 1st instance of whirling disease in RVC. According to Jarbeau, CFIA will determine further disease declarations on the status of whirling disease when the complete results of this year's [2016] surveillance plan testing have been received.

"The CFIA response to reportable diseases begins with a disease investigation," she said. "Depending on the results of an investigation, the CFIA may make a disease declaration specifying water bodies or geographic areas to be infected. The CFIA may also implement controls, such as permits, to contain aquatic animal reportable diseases within areas of Canada where they are known to occur."

Once this year's [2016] testing is complete, she said the CFIA will update the declared infected area for whirling disease, which will help establish the boundaries for applicable federal domestic movement controls.

"Fish are an important part of local ecosystems and sport fishing in Alberta generates significant economic activity," Jarbeau said.

[Whirling disease affects salmonids (that is, trout, salmon, grayling, whitefish). The etiologic agent, _Myxobolus cerebralis_, is a protozoan that was introduced to the United States from Europe in the 1950s. It needs to infect a tubificid oligochaete (_Tubifex tubifex_, a kind of segmented worm) to complete its life cycle (in fact, _T. tubifex is the definitive host of _M. cerebralis_, and fish are intermediary hosts).

Infection by the parasite in fish does not always lead to development of the disease or to population losses. However, this can occur under certain circumstances and whirling disease has been associated with major fishery losses and economic costs.

The impact on wild salmonid populations is associated with the lineage of _T. tubifex_ present in the area, as some are more prone to be infected.

Whirling disease cannot infect humans, mammals, or fish that are not members of the salmonid family. - Mod.PMB
