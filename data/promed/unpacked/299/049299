French health authorities have asked doctors on the Riviera to be on
the alert after a 2nd case of the mosquito-borne chikungunya virus
was detected in the region this weekend. In the town of Frejus, 2
12-year-old girls have caught the virus that causes fever, headaches
and arthritic-type symptoms that leave victims stooped, officials
said Sunday [26 Sep 2010]. They noted that both cases were "native,"
meaning that the victims had not travelled to the parts of eastern
Africa, southeast Asia or the Indian subcontinent were the virus is widespread.

The tiger mosquito [_Aedes albopictus_] transmits the chikungunya
virus. The insect has moved north in recent years.

There is no known vaccine or treatment for chikungunya [virus
infection], which has infected millions of people in Africa and Asia
and can cause debilitating pain and, in extreme cases, death [death,
very rarely - Mod.TY].

A region in Italy suffered an outbreak of chikungunya that hit 240
people over a 2-month period.

An outbreak on the French Indian Ocean island of Reunion in 2005
infected a quarter of the population in less than 2 years, causing
some 250 deaths.

[The occurrence of 2 locally acquired chikungunya virus infections in
southern coastal France is not surprising. The risk was pointed out
in an official French government warning issued on 27 Jul 2010 (see
ProMED-mail archive no. 20100731.2564). This risk is due to the
presence of the Asian tiger mosquito (_Ae. albopictus_), mosquito
populations in southern France, and frequent imported cases of
chikungunya virus-infected travelers (see ProMED-mail archive no.
20100616.2008). One hopes that the rapid response to the appearance
of these 2 cases will preclude an outbreak similar to the chikungunya
virus outbreak in Italy in 2007 that also was transmitted by _Ae.
albopictus_ (see ProMED archive no. 20071210.3980).

An excellent assessment of _Ae. albopictus_-related disease risks,
including maps from the European Center for Disease Control, can be
