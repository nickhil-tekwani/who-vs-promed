[JP], a 39-year-old resident of Khedbrahma taluka in Sabarkantha district, was tested positive for Congo fever [Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever]. JP is currently taking treatment at VS [Sheth Vadilal Sarabhai] Hospital and is likely to be discharged on [Sat 11 Nov 2017]. Top sources in the civic body-run hospital confirmed that JP had been tested positive for Congo fever.

"[JP] had been admitted on [Sat 4 Nov 2017] and was tested positive for Congo fever on [Tue 7 Nov 2017]. She had been showing symptoms since [Sun 29 Oct 2017], such as fever with shivering, vomiting, headache and haematuria [presence of red blood cells in urine]," said the source.

At that time, [JP] was admitted at a private hospital in Idar, and later brought to a private hospital in Ahmedabad. After this, she was shifted to VS Hospital. "Her condition is better, and she is recovering at the hospital. If her reports are fine, she may be discharged on [Sat 11 Nov 2017]. Doctors will take appropriate decisions based on her condition," said the top source.

[The 1st cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) were reported in Gujarat state of India in January 2011, resulting in 3 deaths in confirmed and suspected cases of CCHF, which included 2 health care workers (http://www.searo.who.int/entity/emerging_diseases/topics/cchf/en/). Another notifiable outbreak occurred in July 2013 in Karyana Village, Amreli district, Gujarat State. Anti-CCHF virus (CCHFV) immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were detected in domestic animals from the adjoining villages of the affected area, indicating a considerable amount of positivity against domestic animals https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25229708.

During 2012-2015, several outbreaks and cases of CCHF transmitted by ticks via livestock and several nosocomial infections were reported in the states of Gujarat and Rajasthan. Cases were documented from 6 districts of Gujarat (Ahmadabad, Amreli, Patan, Surendranagar, Kutch, and Aravalli) and 3 districts of Rajasthan (Sirohi, Jodhpur, and Jaisalmer).

In 2014, a serosurvey was carried out to determine the prevalence of CCHFV among bovine, sheep, and goat populations from 15 districts of Gujarat State, India. A total of 1226 serum samples from domestic animals were screened for IgG antibodies using a CCHF animal IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Antibodies were detected in all the 15 districts surveyed; with positivity of 12.09 percent, 41.21 percent, and 33.62 percent in bovine, sheep, and goat, respectively. This necessitates the surveillance of CCHFV IgG antibodies in animals and hemorrhagic fever cases in humans.

Health-care workers are an important risk group, as evidenced by the large number of nosocomial infections often associated with CCHF outbreaks. Infected patients should be isolated and subjected to barrier nursing techniques. Health-care workers should mandatorily wear minimum essential personal protective equipment while attending the patients or while performing any allied procedures. It is interesting to note that no tertiary cases were reported in AIIMS hospital, Delhi, where the positive CCHF case was handled. This could be due to effective biosafety measures followed during nursing the case and administration of Ribavirin to all potential hospital contacts. The state government of Gujarat has made efforts for the cautious handling of suspected CCHF cases. A high level of preparedness plan was implemented in India at the country level during the Ebola outbreak situation in the year 2014 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12879-016-1971-7, and CCHF belongs to the high-risk group of diseases and should also be given priority. - Mod.UBA
