A new disease called chikungunya that causes painful and sometimes crippling symptoms has spread in the capital Dhaka, raising a public health alarm. [Chikungunya virus infections may be new to some areas in Dhaka, but it is certainly not new to the general area or the country. - Mod.TY]

The mosquito-borne chikungunya virus 1st broke out in the northern Chapainawabganj district in 2008 and a year later it was found in the north-western Santhia, and in 2011 again in northern Shibganj Upazila. The same year it was also found in the Dhaka suburb of Dohar.

But the government's disease monitoring arm, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), on Wednesday [30 Apr 2014] only confirmed its presence in the capital after testing bloods from households of 4 different corners. Director of the IEDCR Prof Mahmudur Rahman, however, urged people not to be panicky, rather be aware of the disease and prevent mosquito bites.

_Aedes aegypti_, which causes dengue [transmits dengue viruses], aka breakbone fever, carries the virus.

Chikungunya causes fever and severe joint pain. Other symptoms include muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue and rash. According to the World Health Organisation, the disease shares some clinical signs with dengue, and can be misdiagnosed in areas where dengue is common.

There is no cure for the disease. Treatment is focused on relieving the symptoms.

Since 2004, chikungunya fever has reached epidemic proportions, with considerable morbidity and suffering, WHO says. It caused an epidemic that began in Kenya in 2004 and spread to several Indian Ocean islands including the Comoros, Mauritius, the Seychelles, Madagascar, Mayotte and Reunion.

India reported an estimated 14 million cases since December 2005.

The joint pain is often very debilitating, but usually lasts for a few days or may be prolonged for weeks.

Director Prof Rahman said their team had collected blood samples in August and September last year [2013] from every 10th house of Sutrapur, Dhanmondhi, Motijheel and Mohakhali areas. More than 600 samples have been tested from people between 15 years and 60 years old.

Analysing the report, he said they had found recent infections in 33 per cent of people among the tested blood, and 3 per cent have been found with past infections.

Chikungunya virus is a type of virus called an arbovirus that _Aedes albopictus_ mosquitoes can also spread. But this type of mosquito is seen mostly in rural areas. Monsoon is the season of virus [transmission].

Prof Rahman said they would look further to ascertain how many people among the sample tested had fever. "We just drew samples from one in every 10th house, did not consider whether he/she suffered fever or not," he said. He said internationally it was established that in 25 per cent of cases the virus could be 'asymptomatic' in a person. But he asserted that doctors have to take chikungunya [virus infection] into their consideration when they diagnose a patient with symptoms similar to dengue.

The IEDCR tests any blood samples doctors refer for chikungunya without any charge, he said. The test is also available in some big private facilities, but in those it is expensive.

The director said they would study further at least 10 districts to understand the spread of the mosquito-borne disease. "I feel it's an emerging public health problem for us," he said.

Mosquito-borne disease is a worldwide concern that prompted the WHO to observe this year's health day on the issue. Bangladesh has 6 mosquito-borne diseases that include malaria, kala-azar, filariasis, and Japanese encephalitis, as well as dengue and chikungunya.

Mosquito prevention is the key, Prof Rahman said, adding that "chikungunya patients should be kept within mosquito nets." The disease does not spread person to person, but mosquito bites spread it, he said. _Aedes aegypti_ mostly breeds in domestic containers in clean water.

[As indicated in the above report, there have been sporadic reports of outbreaks of chikungunya virus infections in several localities in Bangladesh in 2008 and 2011. Interestingly, although avoidance of mosquito bites is recommended by Bangladesh health authorities, which is very good advice for reducing the risk of infection, no mention is made of the need for elimination of vector mosquito breeding sites in and around houses and other buildings to reduce the risk of virus transmission.

ProMED thanks Roland Hubner for sending in this report as well.
