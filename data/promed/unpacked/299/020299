The National Director of Epidemiology of the Bolivian Ministry of
Health, Rene Barrientos, reported that one person has died from
yellow fever [YF], the 1st case this year [2007]. The 17-year-old
man died last week in a hospital in La Paz, but was infected in the
tropical township of Asunta, in the Yungas region [an endemic area]
of La Paz department.
In 2006, 8 people died from YF in Bolivia. In April [2007] the
Ministry of Health will conduct a YF vaccination campaign targeting
the age group 2-49 years.

[This case raises the question about the occurrence of the YF virus
vector, _Aedes aegypti_, in the Bolivian Yungas. Not only is a
well-focused vaccination program prudent, a mosquito vector survey
would also be important, not just to assess current risk, but for
future risks in this YF virus endemic area. There is no danger of
virus transmission in La Paz, where the patient was hospitalized,
because of colder temperatures and no _Aedes aegypti_. La Paz is at
nearly 4000m above sea level,and temperatures are much cooler than
the tropical Yungas. This case illustrates the need for residents or
visitors going to endemic areas to be vaccinated against YF virus,
even if international travel regulations may not require it.

Andes. Location map:
