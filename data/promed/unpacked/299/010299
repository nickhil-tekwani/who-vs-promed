Uganda: deadly cattle disease breaks out in Nakapiripirit District
------------------------------------------------------------------
An infectious livestock disease has broken out in Nakapiripirit District
[north-eastern Uganda, bordering Kenya; see map at
<http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/uganda.pdf>. - Mod.AS],
killing hundreds of animals, the district production officer, Dr Godfrey
Orengen has said. The disease is believed to have started 2 months ago.

Dr Orengen says bovine pleuropneumonia [contagious bovine pleuropneumonia,
CBPP] has hit mainly Karita Sub-county leaving several livestock especially
cattle and goats infected dying instantly [see commentary]. He revealed
that, whereas the disease is usually dormant, it flares up during the dry
season when the pastoralists move long distances in search for water and
pasture. Once infected, the livestock gets diarrhoea, nasal discharge,
emaciates, and later dies.

Efforts are already in high gear to control the disease. Local authorities,
who declined to be named said the strange disease could have been imported
from neighbouring Kenya particularly Turkana and Pokot through cross border
cattle raids by the warriors.

Information availed to Daily Monitor indicates that about 100 animals have
so far died in the last one month.

Dr Orengen said that, whereas vaccination is the only way to save the
livestock, efforts by the district authorities to have pastoralists pay
Shs300 [USD 0.18] per animal in cost-sharing to have the animals vaccinated
have not yielded any results. The pastoralists have rejected payment
because they claim not to have the money.

The Kenyan government has already vaccinated animals in the Kenya pastoral
communities for safety. Whereas there are a lot of fears here that the
disease could affect human beings, Dr Orengen declined to comment and
referred this reporter to the Ministry of Agriculture, but no response has
been obtained from the authorities.

[CBPP, a disease of cattle caused by _Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides
SC_ (bovine biotype) (SC = small colonies), is manifested by anorexia,
fever, and respiratory signs such as dyspnoea, polypnoea, cough, and nasal
discharge. Diarrhoea is definitely not one of its clinical manifestations
(but is of rinderpest, which should be excluded). Goats are not infected by
the CBPP agent but by a specific caprine mycoplasma, causing contagious
caprine pleuropneumonia (CCPP).

CBPP is regarded to be endemic in Uganda. If the descriptions in the above
newswire are accurate, with diarrhoea being one of the prevailing disease
symptoms in the affected cattle, then other or additional causative agents
should be considered. It is, however, possible that the report confuses
between peste des petits ruminants in goats (present in Uganda, with
diarrhoea as a symptom) and CBPP in the cattle. Anyway, clear, accurate
disease descriptions in cattle and goats and clarifications are essential.

The diagnosis of CBPP depends on the isolation of the aetiological agent.
The main problems for control or eradication are the frequent occurrence of
subacute or asymptomatic infections and the persistence of chronic carriers
after the clinical phase.

CBPP is not zoonotic. Laboratory diagnosis is anticipated. - Mod.AS]
