The Ramatlabama border post between Botswana and South Africa has
been closed for entry and exit of livestock and fresh products
following the outbreak of anthrax disease in the North West Province
of South Africa. The [Botswana?] Department of Animal Health and
Production has advised people not to eat any meat from livestock that
has died from anthrax, as it can cause localised skin lesions and
sudden death. A news release from the department requests farmers to
bring their cattle for vaccination next month, January 2003.
Travellers are advised to use the Pioneer Border Post near Lobatse
until further notice. The outbreak of the disease is along the border
with Botswana in the Ramatlabama district.
In a bid to control the disease, the release states, the department
will conduct regular surveillance in animals along the border for
signs suggestive of anthrax. People are asked to report any animal
suspected to have the disease to the nearest veterinary office or
police station.

[This confirms a hint in the previous report that the situation may
be worse than reported in north-west South Africa. Logically it
implies a fear in Botswana that South African commercial herds may be
affected. It also addresses the uncontrolled marketing of fresh meat
from domestic slaughtering and butchering of sick animals. Why the
livestock vaccination in Botswana has been delayed until January 2003
is not immediately clear, except that it may relate to preset days
for animals being treated for ticks at communal cattle dips. -
