[It is now 18 days since the last report of a locally transmitted case in Wuhan -- 4 days more than 1 incubation period (an outbreak is usually declared over/transmission declared interrupted after 2 incubation periods without newly confirmed cases). In today's (21 Apr 2020) report, there are 7 new reports of locally transmitted infection, all 7 in Heilongjiang, and 23 newly confirmed imported cases bringing the total of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours to 30. It has now been 28 days since restrictions were lifted in Guangdong and Heilongjiang, and it appears as though local transmission has been established in both Heilongjiang and Guangdong over the past 17 days or so, albeit the number of reported cases from Guangdong is decreasing and no newly confirmed cases were reported today (21 Apr 2020).

According to the report above, a total of 82 788 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 4632 deaths, representing an increase of 30 cases mentioned above, in the 24 hours since yesterday's (20 Apr 2020) report, and there were no newly reported deaths. 4 new cases were reported from Hong Kong, where numbers of newly confirmed cases continue to be reported daily but are decreasing. And Macau has reported no newly confirmed cases.

As best as I can decipher from the machine-translated report above, there were 42 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic people in the past 24 hours, 7 in imported cases. There was 1 conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The total number of asymptomatic individuals currently under observation (and isolation) is 991, 172 of these are importations from abroad. It would be helpful to know what proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals went on to be symptomatic to start developing projections of actual infection rates and adjust reported case fatality ratios accordingly.

As reported, on 24 Mar 2020, China ended the lockdown in Hubei and elsewhere, and ended it in Wuhan on 7 Apr 2020. There is much caution and skepticism in the media over the reality of the zero case reports. The world is watching carefully to see whether this is safe timing. There do appear to be chains of transmission ongoing in Guangdong and Heilongjiang that are of concern, but clearly the most concerning are the imported cases returning to China.

Testing of clusters:
- From testing of contacts linked to Uijeongbu St Mary's Hospital in Gyeonggi Province, 1 additional case was confirmed. The case was a contact of a previously confirmed case and was confirmed when tested for release from mandatory home quarantine. (Close contacts must test negative before being released from quarantine.)

- From testing of contacts linked to Fatima Hospital in Daegu City, 1 additional case (a healthcare staff) was confirmed. The case was a contact of a previously confirmed case in this cluster. The case was confirmed positive when tested for release from home quarantine.

Social distancing:
- KCDC asked everyone to actively participate in and follow the current Social Distancing campaign/policy effective until [5 May 2020]

KCDC recommended that any facility that makes it easy for people to come in close contact with other people in an enclosed space should refrain from operating as much as possible. Such facilities that have to remain in operation should comply with infection prevention/control guidelines including checking all users for fever or respiratory symptoms, keeping a log of all users, requiring everyone to wear facemasks and keep distance from each other, and disinfecting and ventilating the space.

KCDC stressed that reducing contact with other people as much as possible and maintaining personal hygiene are highly important to preventing COVID-19.

People who cannot avoid visiting an enclosed/crowded place should keep at least 2 meters of distance from others, wear a facemask, and maintain hand hygiene by washing hands or using hand sanitizers.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 183 957 cases, including 24 648 deaths, up from 181 228 cases and 24 114 deaths reported on 20 Apr 2020. The 24-hour change between 20 and 21 Apr 2020 was 2729 newly confirmed cases, compared with 2256 newly confirmed cases between 19 Apr 2020 and 20 Apr 2020 -- a slow vacillating decline. Cases continue to be concentrated in the northern part of the country, in Lombardy, the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Piedmont. These 4 provinces combined account for 75.8% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Lombardy is the main contributor representing 35.2% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. 6 provinces reported less than 10 newly confirmed cases and another 3 provinces reported less than 50 newly confirmed cases. All signs of decreasing local transmission.

[4] Iran: 84 802 total cases, 5297 deaths

Iran's tally of confirmed COVID-19 cases neared 85 000 on Tuesday [21 Apr 2020], as the country continued to report double-digit numbers of deaths, health officials said. Infections from the coronavirus disease rose by 1297 to reach 84 802 and the death toll increased to 5297, with 88 new deaths in the past 24 hours, Health Ministry Spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour was quoted as saying by ISNA [Iranian Students News Agency].

"So far, 60 965 patients have recovered and been discharged from hospitals," he said, adding that more than 3300 remain in critical condition. Iran has carried out 365 723 tests across the country to identify those who have contracted the infectious disease.

The health official said, "We hope that people will help combat COVID-19 by observing personal and public hygiene as well as adhering to smart distancing." Iran launched its Smart Distancing Initiative after the 13-day Iranian New Year [20 Mar 2020] holidays to address the pandemic without fully hitting pause on the economy. Under the plan, low- and medium-risk businesses have resumed operations after committing to comply with strict guidelines devised by the Health Ministry, although the public are still urged to stay at home.

Downtrend
---------
According to Jahanpour, 126 laboratories across the country are currently equipped to test patients suspected of having caught the deadly virus. The official noted that the downtrend has continued in the past few days and "we hope to bring better news to the people in the coming days".

Following the identification of 2 patients in the central city of Qom, Iran closed schools and later dormitories and universities to stem the spread of the outbreak. Schools, universities, ceremony halls, sport and cultural centers, as well as high-risk businesses, remain closed. Low- and medium-risk businesses were allowed to reopen in a phased manner but high-risk lines of work such as beauty salons, gyms, and swimming pools are still on lockdown.

Iran is handing out cash payments to those most vulnerable to the economic ramifications of the pandemic and offering financial incentives for small- and medium-sized enterprises that have not laid off employees.

Confirmed coronavirus cases around the world crossed 2.5 million on Tuesday [21 Apr 2020] and death numbers rose above 170 000. The United States accounts for a quarter of deaths caused by the respiratory illness.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA, as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 819 164 including 26 405 deaths, an increase from 792 759 cases and 42 514 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York state, with 256 555 (31.3%) cumulative case reports and 4461 (16.9%) newly confirmed cases over the past 24 hours, is clearly the epicenter of the outbreak in the USA, although case reporting elsewhere is increasing. New York City had a cumulative total of 134 874 as of 1:00 PM on 21 Apr 2020, including 9562 confirmed deaths and an additional 4865 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

Daily reported case counts are high in New Jersey (3581 -- 13.6% of total), California (2105 -- 8.0%), Massachusetts (1556 -- 5.9%) and Illinois (1551 -- 5.9%). In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by New Jersey, Massachusetts, California, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Michigan, Florida, Louisiana, and Texas.

There have been 863 cases reported from federal prisons (an increase of 59 cases in the past 24 hours), and 1321 cases reported from the Navaho Nation (an increase of 124 cases in the past 24 hours). Puerto Rico has reported 1298 cases (an increase of 46 cases in the past 24 hours).

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) has 2 epidemic curves. One focuses on date of confirmation of disease, the other on date of onset of illness.

[Spain is 2nd globally in terms of the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19. There were 3968 newly confirmed cases reported today (21 Apr 2020) and 4266 cases reported yesterday (20 Apr 2020). I suspect a gradual decrease in daily cases starting to show down from the plateau levels of 4000-5000 cases newly confirmed each day.

As of today (21 Apr 2020), totals of 204 178 cases and 21 282 deaths have been reported, up from 200 210 cases and 20 852 deaths in the preceding 24 hours (20 Apr 2020). The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population is now 135.4, a continual slow decrease over the past 14 days from a high of 214.43 on 7 Apr 2020 to 135.4 today (21 Apr 2020). Spain has the highest case count in Europe and is 2nd globally behind the USA in terms of absolute numbers of cases. Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease, and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times. There is also a clear growth curve showing the trajectory of the epidemic at https://covid19.isciii.es/; it is updated daily.

Of the 204 178 cases, approximately 77 076 (37.7% have been hospitalized and 7705 (3.8% -- similar decrease observation) admitted to the ICU (there is a note mentioning that some of the communities are providing daily prevalence data, hence my use of "approximately" for hospitalization and ICU data).

A map of Spain showing provinces (autonomous communities) can be seen at https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/spain-administrative-map.htm and a HealthMap/ProMED-mail map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=7253115,43. La Rioja, Navarre, and Basque Country, the most affected communities by population-based rates, are located together in the north of the country. Madrid is in the northern part of central Spain, and Castile-La Mancha is just to the south of Madrid, with Toledo as its capital. - Mod.MPP]
