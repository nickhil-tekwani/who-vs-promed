Avian influenza weekly update number 766
Human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) virus
--------------------------------------------------
Between [30 Oct and 5 Nov 2020], one new case of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) virus was reported to WHO in the Western Pacific Region. The case is a one-year old female from Saravan province, who had exposure to domestic poultry. She developed cough, fever, and difficulty breathing on [13 Oct 2020]. On [16 Oct 2020], she was hospitalised and had her sample collected. She was discharged on [19 Oct 2020]. All household contacts tested negative for Influenza A.

As of [5 Nov 2020], a total of 239 cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) virus were reported from 4 countries within the Western Pacific Region since January 2003 (Table 1). Of these cases, 134 were fatal, resulting in a case fatality rate (CFR) of 56 percent. The last case was reported from Lao PDR, with an onset date of [13 Oct 2020] (one case, no death).

[Influenza viruses are constantly changing and animal flu viruses can change such that they may gain the ability to infect easily and spread among people. Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk for sporadic infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments.

Human infections with novel avian influenza virus like Asian H5N1 are concerning because of their pandemic potential.

Globally, from January 2003 to 5 Nov 2020, there were 862 cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) virus reported from 17 countries. Of these 862 cases, 455 were fatal (CFR of 53%). As of 5 Nov 2020, a total of 239 cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) virus were reported from 4 countries within the Western Pacific Region (Cambodia, China, Laos, and Viet Nam) since January 2003. Of these cases, 134 were fatal, resulting in a case fatality rate (CFR) of 56%. The most recent case is the one reported above from Laos, with an onset date of 13 Oct 2020 (one case, no death) (https://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/H5N1_cumulative_table_archives/en/).

With continued incidence of avian influenza due to existing and new influenza A(H5) viruses in poultry, there is a need to remain vigilant in the animal and public health sectors. Community awareness of the potential dangers for human health is essential to prevent infection in humans. Surveillance should be continued to detect human cases and early changes in transmissibility and infectivity of the viruses. -Mod.UBA
