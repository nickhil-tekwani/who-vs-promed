the latest outbreak was reported at the end of December 2008.

The number of patients reported from Embilipitiya in the Ratnapura district
is 1106 while another 200 patients have been reported from Polonnaruwa and
the outbreak is now dwindling, deputy epidemiologist, Dr Paba Palihawadana
said.

Healthcare and Nutrition Ministry sources said between 300 to 400 patients
were reported per day during the 1st few days of the outbreak. About 3000
Chikungunya patients have been discovered from affected areas.

Provincial health director Dr Kapila Kannangara said arrangements have been

location of the current cases nor if they were laboratory confirmed as
well. The report above gives specific locations and numbers of chikungunya
cases.

Chikungunya disease has hit around 300 people in 6 sub districts in Madiun
Regency and many of the sufferers are paralyzed [presumably reluctant to
move due to severe arthralgia (joint pain) caused by their chikungunya
virus infection. - Mod.TY]

Paramedics in Madiun said they have been overwhelmed by the number of
patients since a month ago.

One chikungunya sufferer from Bacem Village, Kebonsari Sub-District,
Nursarifah, said that her joints had been painful for the last 2 weeks.

Head of Health Department in Madiun, Sudijo, said that they are spreading
abate powder to kill the mosquito larva. "We have not yet reached all
areas," he said.

As many as 1569 residents of the Indragiri Hulu Regency, Riau, [Sumatra]
were attacked by chikungunya [virus] a last week [week of 28 Dec 2008]. The
situation caused this area to be maintained in the status of an
extraordinary incident [emergency] due to this illness.

Section head Kesehatan Indragiri Hulu Helmi Manaf, on Monday (5 Jan
[2009]), said that this infectious disease, resulting from mosquito bite
[transmitted virus] attacked 18 villages in 5 sub districts there.

This illness that attacked joints was found for the 1st time in the Lirik
Sub district, specifically in the Lambang Village as the main focus. The
residents who were attacked by this illness experienced fever, which was
accompanied by joint pain [arthralgia].

"We had coordinated and sent blood samples for testing to the Department of
Health." Results of the laboratory tests were positive and confirmed
[chikungunya virus infection], Helmi indicated.

In anticipation of continued expansion of the chikungunya outbreak in this
territory, Helmi confirmed dropping the team off in order to carry out mass
medical treatment in the affected area. Medical treatment was given free.

Moreover his group carried out spraying (fogging) in the outbreak area. "We
also carried out education and involvement of the community to live in a
clean [environment]. And [we] recommended to the community to carry out 3M
[drain, bury, cover to eliminate _Aedes_ mosquito breeding sites for these
vectors of the virus. - Mod.TY]," he indicated.
