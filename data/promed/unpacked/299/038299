Headache, fever, cough, sneezing and myalgia. These are the main
symptoms of a viral disease that is again devastating Salvador. The
disease, known as "Quebra ae" [locally], also comes accompanied by
gastrointestinal complications such as vomiting and diarrhea. On
average, the [disease course] lasts between 2 and 4 days.
Increasing numbers of cases have been registered in private
hospitals, at the Portuguese Hospital, and at health posts such as
the 5th Center. However, these units have not informed us of the
exact number of [patients] that have been treated during the past
week. The outbreak is also affecting the productivity of businesses,
due to employees who have been out on sick leave.
