A horse in Bottineau County has tested positive for a disease caused by an equine virus, North Dakota animal health officials said Thursday [26 Dec 2019].

The horse was confirmed positive for EHM (equine herpes myeloencephalopathy), a disease caused by equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1). Since October [2019], several outbreaks of EHM have been reported in Oklahoma, Virginia, Pennsylvania and California.

The virus can be spread through the air and on contaminated equipment, clothing and hands. Horse owners can reduce the risk of spreading the disease by avoiding shared food or water containers and preventing nose-to-nose contact among horses.

The virus can cause respiratory disease, abortion and neonatal death in horses. Out-of-state horses entering North Dakota for any length of time must be accompanied by a certificate of veterinary inspection.

The North Dakota State Board of Animal Health and the North Dakota Department of Agriculture's Animal Health Division are reminding horse owners to protect their horses from the virus. Although highly contagious among horses, EHV-1 poses no threat to human health.

[This article does not tell us if this animal was vaccinated against the nasal form of the virus. None of the available vaccines have a label claim to prevent the neurologic form of EHV-1 infection. It has been suggested vaccines may assist in limiting the spread of outbreaks of equine herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHM; EHM is an alternative name for a neurologic disease associated with EHV) by limiting nasal shedding of EHV-1 and dissemination of infection. For this reason, some experts hold the opinion there may be an advantage to vaccinating in the face of an outbreak. If this approach is pursued, only afebrile and asymptomatic horses should be vaccinated, and protection against clinical EHM should not be an expectation. The vaccines with the greatest ability to limit nasal shedding and viremia of the neurovirulent strain include the vaccines licensed for control of abortion (Pneumabort-K and Prodigy) and the modified live vaccine (Rhinomune and Calvenza).
