The Arizona Department of Agriculture (ADA) has announced [that] a
single steer in a Pinal County rodeo stock operation tested positive
for bovine tuberculosis (bovine TB). The event cattle operation has
been placed under quarantine. The affected steer was recently imported
into the state of Arizona from Mexico and tested negative for bovine
TB at the time of importation. The positive diagnosis was determined
when the steer was retested to meet another state's entry
requirement.

"This diagnosis is a reminder of how important it is to keep high
risk imported steers and spayed heifers separate from domestic beef
and dairy breeding cattle," stated Acting State Veterinarian John
Hunt. Hunt says since there is no treatment for cattle infected with
bovine tuberculosis, exposed cattle must be either tested or
depopulated. Given that the time from an animal's exposure to a
positive test can be several months, it can take months of testing to
ensure the disease is eradicated from a herd.

Arizona has been declared free of bovine tuberculosis since 1978.
"Free status" was temporarily suspended due to an incident in 1979 but
was reinstated in 1981 after prompt elimination of the disease.

The State Veterinarian and the ADA veterinary staff are working
closely with USDA officials to implement the best course of action to
eliminate the disease.

[Bovine tuberculosis is a chronic problem in Mexico, albeit mainly in
the states away from the US border. It would probably be fruitful to
recheck other Mexican steers intended for US rodeos that crossed the
border in the same week as this steer but which went to other
destinations. If there was a shedder somewhere along the route, either
within Mexico or the US, there will be other infected steers beginning
to reveal themselves, if retested. - Mod.MHJ]
