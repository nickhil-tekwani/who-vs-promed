On 7 Feb 2021, 5 people with signs of foodborne illness were admitted to the infectious diseases department of the Bulungur District Medical Association in Samarkand region in southeastern Uzbekistan. They were later diagnosed with botulism at the hospital.

Despite the efforts of the doctors, one of the admitted, a 20-year-old man, died. Four more are in intensive care.

According to preliminary data, all 5 the day before, during lunch at the house of one of the victims, ate canned tomatoes prepared at home.

Botulism is a rare but serious illness caused by a toxin produced by _Clostridium botulinum_ bacteria. When ingested, the toxin attacks the body's nerves. Symptoms typically start with muscle weakness in the face and neck, which then spreads to the torso, arms, and legs. The toxin weakens muscles used for breathing, which can lead to death. It is important that anyone ill with symptoms of botulism visit a health care provider immediately to be assessed.

[Classically, botulism is a foodborne disease caused by the ingestion of foods containing preformed toxin in a situation where spores are able to germinate, although there also exists wound botulism (in which _Clostridium botulinum_ spores germinate in a wound), and infant botulism (in which the spores germinate in the intestinal tract). Low acid foods, such as tomatoes and olives, more easily promote the germination.

Types A, B, and E of human botulism are the commonest. Although all types have a similar symptom complex, Hughes and colleagues report that type E is much more likely to produce initial lethargic mental status and more autonomic dysfunction. In eastern Europe, many of the cases are type E related to the ingestion of salted or dried fish. Once suspected, polyvalent botulism antitoxin can be used to minimize morbidity and mortality, but deaths still occur.

Recently, a newer technology has been developed for delivering a non-toxic derivative of the botulinum toxin into the neuron cytoplasm and inhibit toxin effects.

Abstract
----------
Botulism is caused by a potent neurotoxin that blocks neuromuscular transmission, resulting in death by asphyxiation. Currently, the therapeutic options are limited, and there is no antidote. Here, we harness the structural and trafficking properties of an atoxic derivative of botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) to transport a function-blocking single-domain antibody into the neuronal cytosol where it can inhibit BoNT serotype A (BoNT/A1) molecular toxicity. Post-symptomatic treatment relieved toxic signs of botulism and rescued mice, guinea pigs, and nonhuman primates after lethal BoNT/A1 challenge. These data demonstrate that atoxic BoNT derivatives can be harnessed to deliver therapeutic protein moieties to the neuronal cytoplasm where they bind and neutralize intracellular targets in experimental models. The generalizability of this platform might enable delivery of antibodies and other protein-based therapeutics to previously inaccessible intraneuronal targets. - Mod.LL
