Dengue Fever Outbreak in Havana
-------------------------------
Cuban President Fidel Castro said that outbreaks of dengue fever have
occurred in Havana, but he was convinced the island had "the
experience and resources" necessary to defeat the disease. Castro
presided over a ceremony for "Latin American Medicine Day" on Mon 3
Dec 2001, an event first celebrated in 1933 in honor of Cuban
scientist Carlos J. Finlay, who identified the _Aedes aegypti_
mosquito [as the carrier of yellow fever.
At the ceremony, Castro said that: "Some cases of dengue have been
reported in the capital, and we are using our experience and all the
means at our disposal to combat them." "The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito
that transmits the disease can develop resistance to pesticides,"
Castro said, adding that "never before in this capital have there been
such low numbers (of this insect). Insecticides and more effective
equipment are being used, but tremendous discipline and cooperation
are also necessary to deal with the disease."
Castro referred to the "battle" waged in the summer of 1981, when
"more than 350 000 people became infected with virus two [dengue virus
type 2, which when combined with the antibodies left by virus one
[dengue virus type 1, produced hemorrhagic dengue. The situation
we're facing now is not the same," Castro said.

Imported and Local Dengue Fever Cases in the Cook Islands
---------------------------------------------------------
The Cook Islands have recorded 3 cases of dengue fever last month.
[These most recent cases were reported between 26-28 Nov 2001 and all
3 victims contracted the illness in the capital, Rarotonga.
News that mosquitoes carrying the disease are at large in the Cook
Islands comes almost a month after 2 tourists arriving from French
Polynesia were hospitalized with the illness. It is the second time
this year that local cases have been reported after imported cases
were discovered.
The health ministry said it had carried out an eradication programme
to wipe out the disease-carrying insects in the areas where the cases
were reported. However, the recent bad weather delayed the spraying
operations by several days. Other parts of the Pacific have
experienced high levels of the potentially fatal disease this year.
The Secretary of the Ministry of Health, Tupu Araiti, said that there
had been no further reports of the disease in the last 2 weeks. A
total of 9 cases has been reported to authorities in the Cook Islands
this year, although 5 of these have been imported from abroad. The
situation in the Cook Islands is far less serious than in other
Pacific Nations. Samoa and French Polynesia have suffered from major
outbreaks of the mosquito-borne disease recently. Araiti said that the
current situation was similar to another minor outbreak in the country

in July.
