5 farms have been mysteriously affected by an outbreak of salmonella
in Skane, southern Sweden. The Swedish Board of Agriculture has so
far not discovered the outbreak's [source]. Speaking to Dagens Nyheter
newspaper, the Board of Agriculture's veterinary inspector Elod Szanto
described the outbreak as one of biggest salmonella outbreaks of the
last decade.

The farms are now been sanitised and a total of 700 calves, lambs, and
bulls have had to be put down. Szanto believes that the infection
could have come via wild birds or rodents, and they are currently
investigating that possibility.

_Salmonella_ bacteria are not airborne but are passed on orally or
through faecal matter.

[The stamping out of 700 domestic ruminants, including bulls and
calves, because of contamination with _Salmonella_ bacteria may seem
an excessive zoosanitary measure but deserves to be seen in the
context of Sweden's unique _Salmonella_ control policy.

The control of _Salmonella_ in Swedish animal production was started
as early as 1961 with the (seemingly pretentious) aim to keep meat-
and egg-producing animals free from _Salmonella_. This was, among
other things, prompted by a major food borne outbreak in 1953,
involving more than 9000 people.

All serotypes of _Salmonella_ are regarded as unacceptable
and the legislation on salmonella control includes all serotypes
because they are considered potentially pathogenic for humans.

The present Swedish salmonella control programme was approved by the
EU in 1995 and is supervised by the Swedish Board of Agriculture and
the National Food Administration. The salmonella control is governed
by the Law on Zoonoses and several regulations. Any suspicion of
_Salmonella_ in animals is notifiable, and restrictions must be put
on the _Salmonella_ infected holding, such as a ban on all animal
movements. The overall strategy of the Swedish salmonella control
programme is to prevent _Salmonella_ in any part of the production
chain, from feed to food of animal origin, to monitor the whole
chain, and to eliminate infection/contamination with salmonella
whenever found.

In case of positive samples, trace back and trace forward
investigations are made. A stamping-out policy is practised whenever
_Salmonella_ is detected in poultry. This is followed by thorough
cleaning and disinfection, and environmental sampling before
repopulation is permitted. In other animal species, the on-farm
eradication strategy depends on the situation and type of production.

According to the prevailing regulations, restrictions are not lifted
until cleaning procedures are completed and 2 whole herd samplings, 4
weeks apart, have shown negative results.

A separate feed legislation regulates _Salmonella_ control in feed
production plants, and mandatory actions in case of positive feed
samples. Several regulations describe surveillance procedures in
different animal species as well as on-farm eradication procedures.
Preventive hygiene measures and restrictions regarding animal
purchases are included in voluntary programmes that allow affiliated
producers a higher level of compensation for losses caused by
eradication measures in case _Salmonella_ is detected. The majority
of pig producers and many of the large dairy operations as well as
beef cattle breeders are affiliated to the programmes.

Official confirmation of the outbreak will be appreciated; if
affirmative, it will be interesting to note which _Salmonella_
serotype(s) was (were) identified on the 5 farms found infected in
Skane.

It will also be interesting to note the reasons for the decision to apply
stamping out policy in this (non-poultry) case. Was this related to the
identity of the serotype involved? Its pathogenicity or zoonotic
history? Otherwise? - Mod.AS.
