The Minnesota Department of Health has connected dozens of cases of salmonellosis with 17 Chipotle restaurants in Minnesota, including one in St. Cloud. The department received reports of 45 cases of salmonellosis. Because many people with salmonellosis don't seek medical care and get tested, the number of people affected is likely larger.

Doug Schultz, spokesperson for the department, said the likely culprit is a produce item, but couldn't confirm which one. The investigation is not related to other reports of salmonella associated with cucumbers in Minnesota, which was a separate strain, he said. The DNA of the salmonella in all 45 cases was matching or very similar. Of 34 people interviewed to date, 32 ate or likely ate at 17 Chipotle restaurant locations between 16 and 26 Aug 2015. They became ill between 20 and 29 Aug 2015. The Minnesota cases range in age from 15 to 67 years and 56 percent are male. The cases are from 8 metro and outstate Minnesota counties.

Between those dates, the restaurant served more than 560 000 customers in Minnesota. Locations included the 5th Avenue South location near downtown St. Cloud, as well as 7 Corners in Minneapolis, Bloomington, Calhoun, Crystal, Hopkins, Maple Grove, Maplewood, Minnetonka, Richfield, Ridgedale, Rochester, Shoreview, St. Louis Park, St. Paul Lawson, Uptown and US Bank Plaza in Minneapolis. It is also possible that other locations in Minnesota could have been affected as well. At this time there is no indication that locations outside of Minnesota are involved. 5 cases have been hospitalized and all are recovering.

Officials are working to identify the food item source of the outbreak. Chipotle has changed the source of the suspect produce item under investigation. They are confident the ongoing transmission of the outbreak has ended. Chipotle released a statement saying the safety and well-being of its customers are its highest priority. The company has offered full cooperation in the investigation, said Chris Arnold, communications director. The entire supply of the suspect ingredient in Minnesota has been replaced, he said, to ensure food safety.

[ProMED awaits additional information regarding the scope of the outbreak. The serotype of _Salmonella enterica_ and the identity of the "suspect ingredient" are not elaborated in this post, but apparently it was not Mexicann cucumbers. - Mod.LL/JW
