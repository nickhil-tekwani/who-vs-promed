A species of _Aedes_ mosquitoes found in New Zealand
----------------------------------------------------
An exotic mosquito found near Gisborne [North Island has been identified
as _Aedes squamiger_, the Southern Salt Marsh variety, which is usually
found in California. Australian experts announced the finding after
examining adult insects and larvae taken from breeding sites in a lagoon
south of Gisborne. A group of scientists and other experts meets in
Wellington tomorrow to make recommendations on what to do about the
mosquito. Surveys have indicated its presence in Poverty Bay is limited to
the Wherowhero Lagoon and at nearby Brown's Beach.
