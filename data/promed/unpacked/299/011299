Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 - update 104
---------------------------------
As of 6 Jun 2010, worldwide more than 214 countries and overseas
territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of
pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including more than 18 156 deaths.

The WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through
frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and Member States
and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.

Situation update:
-----------------
Active but declining transmission of pandemic influenza virus persists
in limited areas of the tropics, particularly in Southeast Asia and
the Caribbean. As countries of the temperate southern hemisphere enter
winter, only sporadic influenza activity has been detected so far,
except in Chile and Uruguay, both of which have recently reported
small numbers of pandemic influenza virus detections. Although
seasonal influenza B viruses have been the predominant type of
influenza virus circulating worldwide since the end of February 2010,
there have been increasing but low level detections of seasonal
influenza H3N2 viruses, particularly in South America and in East
Africa.

In the tropics of the Americas, overall pandemic influenza activity is
low, however, both seasonal influenza H3N2 and type B viruses are
actively circulating in parts of tropical South America. Active but
declining transmission of pandemic influenza virus continues to be
detected primarily in Cuba. Since early 2010, pandemic influenza virus
has circulated at low levels in Costa Rica. Sporadic detections of
pandemic influenza virus continue to be reported in Brazil. During the
most recent reporting week (last week of May 2010), both Brazil and
Venezuela reported regional spread of influenza activity associated
with an increasing trend of respiratory diseases. In Venezuela, recent
influenza activity (which began during early May 2010) has been
predominantly due to circulating seasonal influenza A viruses. In
Bolivia, circulation of seasonal influenza viruses, predominantly type
B, was observed between March and May 2010 and now appears to be
subsiding.

In Asia overall pandemic influenza virus transmission remains low,
except in parts of tropical South and Southeast Asia, particularly
Singapore, Malaysia, and Bangladesh. In Singapore, overall levels of
ARI remained slightly below the epidemic threshold and the proportion
of respiratory samples testing positive for pandemic influenza virus
increased slightly to 34 percent. In Malaysia, limited data suggests
that pandemic influenza virus transmission has begun to decline since
plateauing during May 2010. In Bangladesh, there has been stable
persistent low level co-circulation of pandemic and seasonal influenza
B viruses since March 2010. Sporadic detections of pandemic influenza
virus continued to be reported across other parts of Asia. In East
Asia, overall influenza activity remains low, however, seasonal
influenza B viruses continue to circulate at low and declining levels.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, pandemic influenza virus continued to circulate
at low levels in parts of West Africa, most notably in Ghana. During
the most recent reporting week, 13 percent of all respiratory samples
tested positive for pandemic influenza virus in Ghana. Small but
significant numbers of seasonal H3N2 viruses have been detected in
Kenya and Tanzania since late May 2010.

Overall, in the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, pandemic
influenza viruses have been detected only sporadically during the past
month. In the temperate southern hemisphere, only 2 countries, Chile
and Uruguay, have recently reported small numbers of pandemic
influenza virus detections. In Chile, there was low level
geographically limited circulation of pandemic influenza virus during
May 2010; 3.4 percent of respiratory samples tested positive for
pandemic influenza virus during the last week of May 2010. Of note, in
Uruguay, 11 (44 percent) of 25 samples tested positive for pandemic
influenza during the most recent reporting week (the last week of May
2010); however, the corresponding intensity of respiratory diseases in
the population is not yet known.

Other respiratory viruses, most notably RSV, are known to be
circulating in Chile and Argentina. There have been no recent
detections of pandemic influenza virus in South Africa. In New Zealand
and Australia, overall levels of ILI remain low; only sporadic
detections of seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses have been
recently reported in Australia.

The Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN) continues monitoring
the global circulation of influenza viruses, including pandemic,
seasonal and other influenza viruses infecting, or with the potential
to infect, humans including seasonal influenza. For more information
on virological surveillance and antiviral resistance please see the
weekly virology update (Virological surveillance data, below).

Description: Displayed data reflect the most recent data reported to
Flunet (<http://www.who.int/FluNet>), WHO regional offices or on
Ministry of health websites in the last 2 weeks. The percent of
specimens tested positive for influenza includes all specimens tested
positive for seasonal or pandemic influenza. The pie charts show the
distribution of virus subtypes among all specimens that were tested
positive for influenza. The available country data were joined in
larger geographical areas with similar influenza transmission patterns
to be able to give an overview
(<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/transmission_zones/en>)

Qualitative indicators (Week 29 to Week 21: 13 July 2009 - 29 May 2010)

The qualitative indicators monitor: the global geographic spread of
influenza, trends in acute respiratory diseases, the intensity of
respiratory disease activity, and the impact of the pandemic on
health-care services.

The maps below display information on the qualitative indicators
reported. Information is available for approximately 60 countries each
week. Implementation of this monitoring system is ongoing and
completeness of reporting is expected to increase over time.
