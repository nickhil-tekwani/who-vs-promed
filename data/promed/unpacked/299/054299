A serious fish disease has broken out in Likapai Ward in Lukulu
District. Likapai ward councilor, Mulako Mate, has confirmed the
development to ZANIS, saying the outbreak has destroyed uncountable
barbell fish in most of the fishing ponds in the area.
Mr. Mate said most of the affected fish were found dead with round
blisters on the skin. The councilor said the disease started early
this month [July 2007] and has expressed worry for people who are
eating the affected fish in the area.
He also feared that the disease may destroy the fish species if the
government delays to mitigate the effects of the epidemic. Mr. Mate
has since called on the government to send some fish specialists to
Lukulu to investigate the cause of the disease. He has also advised
people in his ward to refrain from eating dying fish in order to
safeguard their lives.
The civic leader further said Lukulu would experience severe economic
shocks if the fishing industry is depleted, adding that the disease
will also affect household food security, since fishing is the major
source of income for many people. And Lukulu District Fisheries
Officer Duckson Nsangu confirmed having received reports of the
disease but referred all queries to the Provincial Fisheries Officer in Mongu.

[The described disease is, most probably, epizootic ulcerative
syndrome (EUS), which is clinically characterized by necrotizing
ulcerative lesions typically leading to a granulomatous response.
EUS, a seasonal epizootic condition of great importance in wild and
farmed freshwater and estuarine fish, is a fungal disease considered
to be an infection with an oomycete known as _Aphanomyces invadans_
or _A. piscicida_. EUS has been recently identified in the Zambezi
river; see 20070718.2301.
A laboratory investigation in Zambia is anticipated. - Mod.AS]
