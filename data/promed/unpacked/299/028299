[In keeping with the global picture in 2020 and 2021, cVDPVs are causing more AFP cases in numerous countries. Nigeria and Tajikistan seem to be the current "hotspots" but many countries have had transmission during 2021 to date.

As for WPV1 (wild poliovirus type 1), after an interval of 4 weeks with no WPV1 detected in neither AFP cases, environmental samples nor asymptomatic individuals in areas with documented positive environmental samples, this week there is a positive environmental sample for WPV1 in Sindh. Since the beginning of 2021, there have been positive environmental samples for WHO in all 4 major areas in Pakistan (Sindh, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan and Punjab).

At the risk of sounding like a broken record, globally, right now, the risk of disease from the vaccine is greater than the risk from the disease from the wild virus.

A map showing the locations of each confirmed case of polio worldwide in the past 12 months can be found at https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/. One can see cases of cVDPV in a band across Africa and in Afghanistan and Pakistan, cVDPV1 in Madagascar and Yemen, and WPV1 in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

The Defence-C police arrested 2 young men for allegedly manhandling polio workers, including a woman, when they were visiting the area in a door-to-door vaccination campaign. Police booked 4 men, including 2 suspects who had fled the scene after attacking the polio worker.

According to the first information report (FIR), the arrested suspects, UB and SB, had refused to get their children vaccinated against poliovirus when the vaccinators, reached the home of the latter. As the polio workers insisted on vaccination, both the men manhandled them. 2 other local residents joined the suspects and attacked the polio workers, the FIR said.

The police later arrested UB and SB while their neighbours managed to escape.

A policeman who was assigned to guard polio vaccination workers in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province, was shot dead by unidentified gunmen, according to officials. The miscreants, riding on a motorcycle, opened fire at the victim in the Kot Attal Sharif area of Dera Ismail Khan district on Monday [2 Aug 2021], Xinhua news agency quoted a senior police official as saying.

The policeman was on his way to perform duties with an anti-polio team when he was attacked, said the official, adding that the attackers fled the scene afterwards, and a search operation is under way to arrest the culprits.

This was the 3rd attack in 2 days on Pakistani policemen assigned to protect anti-polio workers in the province. On Sunday [1 Aug 2021] , a police officer, who was returning home after security duty with polio vaccination workers, was killed by unidentified gunmen in Peshawar, the capital of KP province. Similarly, another policeman was injured when a roadside bomb hit a police van escorting a polio vaccination team in the Ladha area of South Waziristan district later in the day [Sun 1 Aug 2021].
