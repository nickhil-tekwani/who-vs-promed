More and more people are falling prey to the dengue outbreak. In Lahore,
157 more cases were reported on Monday [1 Nov 2010]. The total number of
patients in Punjab alone has reached a staggering 1959. The situation in
Sindh and Karachi is equally dismal where so far around 1700 patients have
been registered. However, some doctors believe that the actual number of
patients is far bigger than what is officially stated by the health
authorities. Likewise, the hospitals seem to be running short of medical
kits necessary for the treatment of the dengue fever. Worse still, in
Karachi, some of the government hospitals were found to be treating
patients with fake and substandard medical kits.

[Interestingly, a report issued a week later reports fewer dengue cases in
Punjab province, making one wonder how reliable case statistics are in the
face of this widespread outbreak in the country (see brief reports below).
If the report of the use of fake medical materials is true, that is
alarming news, indeed.
