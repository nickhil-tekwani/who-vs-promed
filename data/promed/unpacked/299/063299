Farmers join call for cat registration laws
-------------------------------------------
Tasmanian farmers want cats to be registered to help stop mass abortions in
sheep. The Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association has joined calls for
the State Government to introduce compulsory registration of cats. At the
association's last meeting on 26 Aug 2005, members voiced strong support
for cat registration and strategies such as desexing and micro-chipping to
try and bring down huge cat numbers around the state.
TFGA Wool Council executive officer Nick Steel said private shooters could
sometimes kill 2 to 3 cats a night but were having a negligible effect on
the overall population. With extermination failing, the focus was now
shifting to control of the domestic population.
"We have tried a lot of things, and now we want to try and stop the
population by using other methods," Mr Steel said. "Cat numbers have been
huge for a long time, and it is getting out of hand. It is now time to work
with councils and people in cities to make them aware of the problems cats
are causing."
The main problem for farmers is toxoplasmosis, a disease carried by many
feral cats that can be transferred to livestock through bites and
scratches. If contracted by a flock of pregnant sheep, the disease can
cause mass abortions, described by some vets as a "toxo storm." The disease
can also be transferred to humans through cat feces in gardens or sandpits,
causing flu-like symptoms and even human miscarriages.
Wool council chairman and sheep farmer Marcus McShane said at its worst,
toxoplasmosis could claim 15 to 20 per cent of lambs. At around AUD 50 (USD
38.5) a lamb, that cost can quickly add up. "From an environmental point of
view, they eat native birds and marsupials. Ask anybody; there is a huge
number of feral cats out there."
The State Government has been non-committal on feral cat control, instead
choosing to focus resources on fox eradication. It took nearly 20 years and
hundreds of hours of man-power to eradicate cats from Macquarie Island,
where they were introduced in the 1800s. The last cat was shot on the
island in 1999 and since then bird species thought to have been wiped out
by cats have returned to nest.
With such a small island posing such a massive challenge, there is little
hope mainland Tasmania will ever be free of feral cats.
Department of Primary Industries, Water and Environment general manager of
resource management and conservation Dr John Whittington said: "Broad-scale
feral cat eradication is not feasible on mainland Tasmania, because they
are so well established. We are taking whatever practical steps are
available to ... reduce the number of feral cats in the state." That has
included trapping programs on Flinders Island and Wedge Island.
The development of a cat-specific toxin called Para aminopropiophenone on
the mainland was also being closely monitored. Farmer and cat control
campaigner Gwendolyn Adams said cat owners needed to take more
responsibility for their animals and to lock them in at night. As a
cat-lover, she said it was a difficult but necessary task to shoot any cats
found on her Perth property. "Once I discovered my little white cat was
capable of killing a ring-tail possum, then I realized feral cats are not
just wild cats, they are also domestic cats that are allowed to stray," she
said.

[Toxoplasmosis is one out of 39 zoonotic disease agents listed in the 2005
Feline zoonoses guidelines from the American Association of Feline
Practitioners (Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery (2005) 7, 243-274).
The list includes 18 bacteria, 6 nematodes, 4 protozoans, 3 ricketsiae and
chlamydia, and (2 each) cestodes, ectoparasites, fungi and viruses (rabies
and cowpox). Most of them can be effectively controlled if cats are owned
and kept at home.
Environmental damages by feral and stray cats, seriously affecting wildlife
and especially birds (to the verge of extinction of endangered species), is
not restricted to Australia. Similar and worse situations have been
observed wherever cats are allowed to stray freely, reaching high
densities. In urban areas, the detrimental effect of stray cats upon the
environment are accompanied by underlined public health aspects, especially
related to children in playing grounds and sandpits. It has been shown that
straying has deleterious effects on the welfare and health of the cats
themselves.
The Australian call for responsible maintenance of owned cats, including
their registration and identification, is valid for all continents. Its
implementation will serve the environment, public health and the welfare
and health of the cats. - Mod.AS]
