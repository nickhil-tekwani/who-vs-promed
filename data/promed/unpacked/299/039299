I would like to comment that we were able to isolate living virus from the brain of experimentally infected mice up to at least 14 days after euthanasia.

In one experiment, mice were inoculated intracerebrally with the rabies virulent CVS-11 laboratory strain. At 6 days after inoculation, mice were euthanized and the intact cadavers were kept at 21 deg C [69.8 deg F] for maximum 14 days. At 0, 1 ,3, 7, and 14 days after euthanasia, the brains were collected, homogenized in cell culture medium, containing foetal calf serum and a high dose of antibiotics, and passed through a microfilter. We were able to isolate virus in neuroblastoma cells even at 14 days after euthanasia, indicating that the virus, or viral RNA, remains somehow infectious in the decomposed brain material, even at this advantaged stage after death.

This little experiment was done in the frame of our ISO17025 accreditation to validate the use of the neuroblastoma virus isolation test on cadavers of wild animals, which are collected in the wild and for which the time of death is often uncertain. We did not test other organs.

The duration of time that rabies virus will remain infectious in a dead animal carcass depends upon the environment that the infected tissue is exposed to. As the tissue decomposes the virus will lose infectivity.

When a rabid animal is decapitated, so that the head may be sent for rabies diagnosis, there is always a potential for virus transmission to the personnel removing the head. Necessary precautions are always advised: rabies vaccination, wearing proper PPE [personal protective equipment] (goggles or face shield to prevent splashing into the eyes, N-95 mask, gown, gloves). Tissues containing large amounts of virus are severed in a proper decapitation; namely, salivary glands, numerous nerves, and most certainly the spinal cord will contain live rabies virus. Cuts from the knives used in a decapitation are considered an exposure to the virus. Other potential exposures to rabies virus such as splashes to mucous membranes or contamination of abraded skin with fluids may occur. Heads kept at refrigeration temperature will contain live rabies virus for weeks. A frozen head will contain live virus until the head is thawed. Essentially a dead rabid animal is still a threat until it is properly disposed of.
