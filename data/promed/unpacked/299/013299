The director for immunization at the Ministry of Health says there are currently 29 reported measles cases in Grand Gedeh, with 7 of those cases confirmed.

Director for immunization at the Health Ministry Adolphus T. Clarke said reports of the outbreak in Tchien district 1st emerged on [Wed 17 Oct 2018]. Speaking to The Bush Chicken in an exclusive interview, Clarke said out of the 29 cases reported, health officials in the area realized that 11 children under 5 years of age were affected by the disease. The other children were older than 5.

"The 29 cases identified were managed at the Martha Tubman Memorial Hospital in Zwedru, and the affected children fully recovered with no death reported."

With support from the Ministry of Health, Clarke said the county responded quickly with vaccinations. "The exercise has concluded, and health officials were able to reach a total of 1551 children not less than 5 years," he said. "So I can say that the county responded swiftly to the outbreak of the disease and recorded zero deaths."

However, things did not go smoothly. Due to the poor road conditions in the southeastern region, Clarke said some health officials who left Monrovia with vaccinations for Grand Gedeh endured difficulties during the journey. "Others had to travel through neighboring Ivory Coast to reach the country," he said.

The director indicated that, due to the challenge in attaining high vaccination coverage, health authorities in the country knew that, at some point in time, there would be sporadic outbreaks of the disease in the county.

Clarke said the current outbreak was not severe, because the ministry has dealt with sporadic outbreaks of measles in the past. He noted that health officials in Grand Gedeh have now been encouraged to carry out vaccination campaigns in affected and nearby communities as the dry season approaches.

"We have encouraged mothers to make use of the health facilities in the county and ensure that their children are vaccinated against all the diseases the ministry is preventing," Clarke said.

Eleven children have died, and more than 40 others have been hospitalised in the past 5 weeks in a measles outbreak in Somalia's Middle Shabelle region.

According to Intersos, which runs the local hospital in Jowhar as well as a number of health posts in the region, dozens of families in several villages in the region have been affected by the measles outbreak since [20 Sep 2018].

The 1st measles cases were reported in Dha'afo in Mahaday district and Burane in Jowhar district.

Dr Abdirahman Ali Abdirahman, director of the Intersos hospital, confirmed the deaths of 11 children, adding that hundreds of others are highly vulnerable to death or permanent disability due to low levels of immunisation.

"The last time a vaccination campaign was carried out in these villages was 2017," Dr Abdirahman said. "The affected children were mostly those who were not brought for the vaccination because their parents do not understand the importance."

A father of 7 who lives in Dha'afo village told Radio Ergo that 3 of his children, a girl and 2 boys, were infected with measles. He had been using an herbal solution made from a local plant called Marer (_Cordia sinensis_) to treat the children.

He said the 2 boys recovered from the disease after several days, but his daughter's condition deteriorated, leading to her becoming blind. "We have been using Marer to treat the children, and the boys fully recovered, but the girl has been sick for 22 days. We later realised that the girl could not see anything, and we rushed her to the hospital, where the doctors confirmed that she had lost her sight," Jafar said.

[Another parent] who lives in Burane village 20 km [about 12.4 mi] from Jowhar town lost his 8-month-old daughter. Four of his children were infected with measles.

"I lost a girl to the disease, but the other 3 are now healthy. We don't have a dispensary in this village, and it is difficult to get any treatment if one falls sick," Adan said.

A mother who lives in Dha'afo village also lost her 4-year-old daughter. She blames the death of her daughter on the fact that she was not vaccinated. "Five of my children have contracted the disease. Four of them were immune to the disease and recovered quickly, but the daughter, who was never vaccinated, died of the disease," the bereaved mother said.

As the number of measles cases continues to grow across Rockland County (NY), 2 additional vaccine clinics have been added for residents who have not received a vaccination against measles, mumps, and rubella [MMR].

The MMR vaccine clinics are in response to 15 confirmed cases to date in Rockland, said Rockland County Executive Ed Day and County Health Commissioner Dr. Patricia Schnabel Ruppert.

"We encourage everyone to be up-to-date with the MMR vaccine to help protect them in case of any future exposure to measles in Rockland," said Dr. Ruppert. "Measles is highly contagious, so anyone who is not protected against measles is at risk of getting the disease, and they may spread measles to people who cannot get vaccinated because they are too young or have specific health conditions."

The new free clinics are [listed at the URL above].

During this clinic, the Health Department will be offering non-immune residents (age 6 months through 60 years) one dose of MMR vaccine at no cost. If you were born before 1 Jan 1957, you do not need to be vaccinated. If needed, additional clinics will be held.

The Health Department has also ordered non-immunized students to stay home from Thu 25 Oct 2018 until Sat 3 Nov 2018, which is 21 days from the last known exposure on 12 Oct 2018.

To prevent the spread of illness, the department is advising individuals who may have been exposed and who have symptoms consistent with measles to contact their healthcare provider, a local clinic, or a local emergency department before going for care. This will help to prevent others at these facilities from being exposed to the illness.

Measles outbreaks have been reported in Williamsburg, in Monsey (Rockland County [see previous post]), in many communities in Israel, and now in Lakewood, New Jersey. Health officials in Lakewood are warning the community about a suspected case of measles and confirmed cases of pertussis and varicella.

The CHEMED [Center for Health Education, Medicine, and Dentistry] Health Clinic in Lakewood tells The Lakewood Scoop that an individual showed signs and symptoms of measles, including a large rash on his body. The patient had just returned from a trip to Israel.

Additionally, there have been confirmed cases of pertussis and varicella. Pertussis, also known as whooping cough, is a highly contagious respiratory disease. Pertussis is known for uncontrollable, violent coughing that often makes it hard to breathe. The highly contagious respiratory tract infection is easily preventable by vaccine.

CHEMED released the following statement to TLS regarding the cases:

"CHEMED would like to make the community aware of a suspected case of measles in Ocean County and confirmed cases of pertussis and varicella. Symptoms of measles include fever, coughing, and a rash that usually starts on the face.

"There is a very real danger for those who are not immunized, such as infants, and those who are immuno-compromised, who may come in contact with an infected person. [Exposure to a] non-immunized pregnant woman could result in exposure to the fetus, for example.

CHEMED would like to remind everyone of the vital importance of being up-to-date with immunizations to protect you and our community."

There have been dozens of stories published by YWN in the past few months of measles alerts issued by authorities involving Frum people who have not been vaccinated.

Last Wednesday [17 Oct 2018], YWN published a story about a measles outbreak in New York, with 6 residents of Williamsburg and 7 residents of Rockland County confirmed to have the disease. An additional 8 suspected cases in Rockland County were being investigated involving a mix of adults and children. Many are linked to recent travel to Israel, which has been dealing with the disease for months.

On Thursday [18 Oct 2018], the Visnitz Monsey Girls School announced that any child who is not immunized can't return to school for 21 days. No "religious exemption" is accepted. A religious exemption does not work when there is a measles outbreak.

Three weeks ago, YWN reported about the Menahel of Breslov Mosdos in Tzefas having been infected with the measles. He was listed in critical condition at the time of the news story.

Earlier Wednesday [17 Oct 2018], YWN published an article where MK (Yisrael Beitenu) Yulia Malinovsky on Monday [15 Oct 2018], during a session of the Knesset Health Committee, blasted the chareidi public of intensifying the spread of measles in Israel because so many of the community refused to vaccinate.

[The suspected case in Ocean County is at least the 2nd measles scare in New Jersey this month [October 2018]. Earlier this month, officials warned that an international traveler, later diagnosed with measles, passed through Newark Liberty International Airport on 28 Sep 2018. The traveler returned on a flight from Israel and then traveled to Rockland County, NY. - Mod.LK
