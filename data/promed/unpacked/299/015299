UK investigators puzzled by anthrax outbreak
--------------------------------------------
Ongoing anthrax outbreak raises concerns the
disease could become endemic in drug users.

Heroin laced with anthrax has killed 16 people in
the UK [13 in Scotland, 3 in England - Mod.MHJ]
over the past 9 months. The ongoing outbreak is
the largest the country has seen for decades, and
the 1st ever recorded in injecting drug users.
With cases still turning up [the last case was
reported in England in late August 2010, some 7
weeks after the last Scottish case. - Mod.MHJ],
questions linger as to whether the infection will
persist in this population, and how the drug
became contaminated in the 1st place.

Since December 2009, infection with anthrax
bacteria has been confirmed in 47 people in
Scotland, and officials have investigated
hundreds more suspected cases, said Colin Ramsay,
consultant epidemiologist at Health Protection
Scotland, earlier this month at the UK Health
Protection Agency (HPA) annual conference. By
February 2010 cases of the disease started
appearing in England, where 3 people have now
died and another recovered from their infection.
At least 2 cases linked to the outbreak were also spotted in Germany.

Only one case of anthrax in an injecting drug
user has ever been seen before, in Norway in
2000. Medics involved in this case coined the
phrase 'injectional anthrax' to describe the
route of transmission and appearance of the
infection. Both the transmission route and
symptoms of injectional cases of anthrax differ
from the existing 3 forms of the disease, which
are known as cutaneous (skin), gastrointestinal
or inhalational anthrax. As a result of the
current outbreak, injectional anthrax is now
recognised as a new form of the disease.

Speaking at the conference, held in Warwick,
Ramsay said he fears the number of cases
confirmed in the UK outbreak may only be the "tip
of the iceberg." Although he is "reasonably
confident" that investigators in Scotland have
identified all cases that occurred in the country
since December 2009, it is not clear that was
when the outbreak began. "It seems improbable
that the 1st ever case was seen in December," he
says. Officials are investigating the possibility
of earlier infections by testing the blood serum
of drug users for the presence of anthrax
antibodies, which would suggest a previous exposure to the bacteria.

Heroin usually passes through England on the way
to Scotland, which raises questions over the
large difference in case counts between England
and Scotland. "It may be something that makes
them [heroin users in Scotland] more susceptible
to the disease," Ramsay tells EHTF News. This
could be alcohol-related liver damage, infection
with hepatitis C, or immune system differences
related to vitamin D deficiency, he suggests.
Undiagnosed cases or less serious ones may be
"slipping under the radar" too, he adds.

But even within Scotland, not all drug users
appear to run the same risk of getting infected
with the bacteria. In some instances, people who
used heroin prepared in the same spoon as a
confirmed case did not contract the bug. "We have
found that it has mostly affected older drug
users, who may have more drug-related pathology
than younger ones," says Ramsay.

Tests on infecting strains of bacteria isolated
in the UK have been completed for all but the
most recent anthrax case. The results have
revealed that the strains behind each case are
"genetically indistinguishable," said Ramsay at
the conference, leading investigators and the
police to believe that a single rogue batch of
heroin is laced with the bug. But this idea goes
against previous police intelligence about
heroin, which suggests that once the drug enters
the country it is used up within days, explains Ramsay.

The latest case, that of a 29-year-old drug user
who died in late August [2010] in the English
county of Leicestershire, has prompted
speculation that heroin supplies could be
chronically contaminated with the bacteria. This
could lead to the disease becoming endemic in UK
drug users, according to Ramsay.

But speaking to EHTF News, he said that although
the most recent case raises these concerns, there
is currently no evidence to support this theory.
"[The latest case] may have had belated access to
the contaminated batch, or a new contaminated
batch," he explains. "We have no way of knowing
[at the moment]." Tests on the infecting strain in this case are ongoing.

Delegates at the conference heard that the
anthrax strain behind the outbreak had never been
seen anywhere before. But Ramsay told EHTF News
that the strain is only new to the UK. The
bacteria isolated from affected drug users in the
UK belong to the 'trans-Eurasian' or
'trans-Caucasian' branch of the anthrax family,
and most closely resemble anthrax strains found
in the Near-East and Middle East, according to
Ramsay. [Those working on the
molecular-epidemiology of anthrax usually refer
to them as "industrials." - Mod.MHJ] Work is
continuing to further characterise the strain, he says.

Phil Luton, a press officer at the HPA, was
unsure whether anthrax has been found in any
samples of heroin tested in England and Scotland.
Ramsay says that although kilograms of the drug
have been scrutinised, experts have found no sign of the bacteria.

The latest theory as to how the drug became
contaminated, according to Luton, is that at some
point along the supply chain, the suspect heroin
was transported while stored in
anthrax-contaminated goat skin. Anecdotal reports
from a prison inmate have confirmed that goat
skins are used to smuggle heroin, delegates heard
at the conference -- but it remains unclear how
widespread the practice is, or whether further
batches of the drug could become contaminated in this way.

On the investigators' initial list of possible
causes of contamination was a biological terror
attack. "We couldn't rule out the possibility
that it wasn't Al Qaeda trying to get anthrax
into the UK," Ramsay said at the conference.
Although this has now been largely dismissed, the
coroner presiding over the death of a case in
England was not satisfied that this suspicion had
been ruled out entirely, Ramsay added.

Aside from the possibility that the heroin itself
is tainted with the bug, a cutting agent used in
the preparation of the drug could also be to
blame for the contamination. Heroin is thought to
be 90 percent pure when it leaves the supplier,
but only 10 percent pure by the time it reaches the user, according to Ramsay.

In the current outbreak, 15 anthrax patients in
Scotland were treated with an experimental drug:
anthrax immunoglobulin, secured from the US
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The
treatment was previously used only in 3 patients,
and tests into its effectiveness are ongoing.
