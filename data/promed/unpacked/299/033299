[This letter (and reply) in Lancet follows up some correspondence
previously posted in ProMED-mail in relation to outbreaks of disease in
Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat attributed to Chandipura virus infection. As
noted previously in ProMED-mail, Chandipura virus was isolated first in
1967 from blood samples from 2 patients during investigation of an outbreak
of another arbovirus disease in Nagpur, India. Subsequently Chandipura
virus was also isolated from phlebotamine sandflies in West Africa.
Chandipura virus (genus _Vesiculovirus_, family _Rhabdoviridae_) is a
ubiquitous infectious agent on the Indian subcontinent, which can infect
humans and many other mammalian species. The high background of specific
antibodies and virus RNA in the population of India combine to obscure the
potential role of this virus in pediatric illnesses, and the significance
of Chandipura virus as a human pathogen is unresolved. The following letter
is a contribution to this debate. - Mod.CP]

Chandipura Virus, Encephalitis, and Epidemic Brain Attack in India
-------------------------------------------------
The report by B Rao and colleagues (1; see references below and ProMED-mail
archives) details an outbreak of encephalitis associated with Chandipura
virus in children in Andhra Pradesh, India, in June-September, 2003.
However, in an analysis of the outbreak (2, see references below), I note
the illness to be encephalopathy, not encephalitis. Typically, a rural
child aged 2-15 years would go to bed normally, but wake up ill in the
early hours of the next morning. Vomiting was followed by loss of
consciousness that deteriorated to a deep coma and decerebrate posturing
within several hours.
Cerebrospinal fluid was clear, under pressure, and without pleocytosis.
Many children died within 48-72 h of onset of symptoms. Early treatment
with mannitol to reduce brain edema was life-saving. Also, in a report in
the Journal of Pediatric Neurology (3), the epidemic is not reported as
encephalitis, nor is the role of Chandipura virus confirmed.
The authors of both reports (1,3) have done excellent work in their
respective specialties -- virology and neurology. The virological studies
established Chandipura virus infection in some children, apparently leading
to the conclusion that it caused the outbreak. A brain disease caused by
viral infection ought to be called encephalitis, hence the outbreak was
described as encephalitis. The detailed neurological findings and erudite
argument by P N Rao and colleagues (3), however, convincingly establish the
outbreak as one caused by an acute catastrophic event in the brain.
The illness mimics Reye's syndrome, with gross brain edema, but there are
important differences (3). The site of the lesion was the area supplied by
the middle cerebral artery (3). There was no clinical evidence of invasion
by a pathogen. The nature of the arterial pathology is likely to be spasm
or transient obstruction due to vasculitis, rather than thromboembolism (3).
That such a disease could arise as an epidemic is new information (4). If
Chandipura virus is the cause, the disease is mediated via vasculitis, not
encephalitis (3). Otherwise another infectious agent, probably viral, might
be involved (3.4). Infection is invoked to explain an epidemic (3,4).
Outbreaks of acute encephalopathy with high case fatality reminiscent of
this outbreak have been reported repeatedly in several northern Indian
towns and villages (1). To assume an illness is infectious just because it
affects a group of people could be misleading. Sriramachari (5) has
suggested the clinical features of the recurrent encephalopathy outbreaks
in northern India could be due to high environmental temperature, with or
without secondary factors. He believes that the heat-related encephalopathy
has all the brain features of Reye's syndrome. B Rao and colleagues(1) note
that the summer temperature in the outbreak region was 36-49 deg C. Both
reports (1,3) state that fever was a consistent feature. Some children
indeed had hyperpyrexia (1). Cases were widely scattered. The subject is
well worth further research.
Outbreak investigations are incomplete without the basics of epidemiology.
Case definition should be made and applied. Epidemiological links between
cases should be ascertained, and risk factors explored. India is not short
of competence in medicine and research, but epidemiology skills, training,
and field application are inadequate.

Author's Reply Appended to the Above Letter in Lancet
--------------------------------------------------
T Jacob John concludes in his letter that the outbreak we describe is of
acute encephalopathy; e.g. Reye's syndrome. However, minimum criteria set
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (1) for this disorder are
not met. 11 magnetic resonance imaging scans of patients from Karimnagar,
Andhra Pradesh, showed hypodensity indicative of damage in the cortical
region and in the frontal and temporal lobes more frequently than in the
parietal and occipital lobes. Young mice infected with Chandipura virus
intra-peritoneally developed CNS lesions, with necrosis particularly
affecting neurons and ependymal cells (4). In our experiments in animals
(unpublished data), we also observed areas of mononucleocyte infiltration
and accumulation of inflammatory cells in the brain after challenge with
Chandipura virus. Furthermore, clinical and biochemical examination of
patients indicated no liver dysfunction -- e.g., liver not palpable, and
serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and ammonia
concentrations within the normal range. As stated in our article, there was
a strong association between Chandipura virus and disease. All cases had
acute onset of fever.
P N Rao and colleagues (3) have attempted to negate the role of Chandipura
virus in the outbreak by analysing 55 cases in 2 groups -- 28 individuals
positive for Chandipura virus, and 27 negative. They note that clinical
findings in the positive group were no different to those in the negative
group, and conclude that the virus therefore had no role in encephalitis.
However, when dealing with arboviral diseases, laboratory confirmation of
samples obtained during investigations of outbreaks is limited because of
sampling time, non-availability of convalescent sample, host factors, viral
load, effect of temperature, and efficiency of the assay systems.
Generally, laboratory confirmation of a specific agent in 40-50 percent of
cases is considered conclusive. We propose that laboratory confirmation
could be done only in the 28 cases; i.e., misinterpretation of the data
resulted in the wrong conclusions being drawn.
P N Rao and colleagues state that all patients presented with fever and
that 60 percent had focal neurological signs, indicating direct involvement
of the brain as a result of infection. We have proof (MRI scans and results
of experiments in animals) of brain inflammation. Thus there is enough and
clear evidence for brain inflammation and focal neurological signs, which
are signs of encephalitis. Endothelial damage, resulting in thromboses,
infarction, and vasculitis in the brain, is an effect of encephalitis (4).
Fever in all cases is clinical evidence of infection. Our laboratory
findings with respect to isolation and detection of virus, serological
status, and viral antigen presentation in brain biopsy by immunofluorescent
assay provide evidence of an association between the virus and the outbreak.
Spotty distribution of the cases and detection of the virus in sand flies
also indicate involvement of some arthropods, which could be the
epidemiological link between the cases.
Fever with altered sensorium is the standard case definition for viral
encephalitis. I believe that the investigation was complete, and we
followed not only basics of epidemiology but also advanced molecular
epidemiological methods to arrive at proper conclusions. For the past 50
years, different hypothetical diagnoses have been put forward for these
outbreaks without any evidence. Now, when a methodical investigation has
produced an evidence-based diagnosis, at least for this outbreak, it would
be prudent to avoid further confusion.
