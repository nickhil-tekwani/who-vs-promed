[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 276 474, with 81 008 cases reported by China. There are now a total of 194 733 confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported from 184 countries/locations outside mainland China representing an increase of 30 168 cases when compared with the data on 19 Mar 2020, with Italy accounting for 5986 of the newly reported cases, Iran for 1237 of newly reported cases, and South Korea for 147 of the newly reported cases. Spain (3433), Germany (4528), France (1617), and the USA (5257) are major contributors to this increase as well. The total number of confirmed cases reported from outside of China now represents 70.4% of the total number of reported cases. The epicenter has shifted outside of China to Western Europe and the USA is accelerating rapidly as more testing has become available. A global total of 11 417 deaths have been reported, 8162 outside mainland China.

For the 23rd consecutive day, more cases have been reported from outside mainland China than within mainland China. The total number of deaths reported from outside of mainland China is now greater than the total number of deaths reported by mainland China. Mainland China has now gone 3 days without any locally transmitted cases; South Korea has slowly decreased daily new case counts with a significant increase in the past 24 hours. But cases in the USA are escalating very rapidly and Europe's rise is equally daunting. It would be interesting to see an epidemic curve by date of onset to see what the true curve of transmission is as I suspect, now that more testing is being done, many of those tested have been sick for days awaiting testing. - Mod.MPP]

[The big news, this is now day 3 with no newly confirmed, locally acquired cases in China in the past 24 hours. While 3 days isn't a definitive interruption of transmission it certainly is a very promising early trend. The challenge will be to identify all imported infections before they can escape from detection and start spreading in the community.

According to the report above, a total of 81 008 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, representing an increase of 41 cases in the past 24 hours since yesterday's (19 Mar 2020) report was prepared. In addition, 7 deaths were reported, all of them by Hubei province. 48 new cases were reported from Hong Kong, which bears watching as the cases have been slowly but steadily climbing. Macau reported no additional newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours.

All 41 newly confirmed cases were imported cases into China representing 100% of all reported cases in the past 24 hours. Cases were reported by Guangdong (7), Beijing (14), Shanghai (9), Fujian (4), 2 each in Zhejiang, Shandong, and Shaanxi, and 1 in Sichuan, bringing the total number of imported cases to 269.

From the English language update on 20 Mar [covering 19-20 Mar 2020] [https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030]:

- Epidemiological links have been found for 80.6% of the total cases; 19.4% are either under investigation or sporadic cases. More details on the epidemiological links within each province or city are shown in Table 2. Case distribution by sex and age group is shown in Table 5. Weekly trend of imported cases by period and region of origin is provided in Figure 1. [Tables and figures are available at the URL above].

- From Guro-gu call center in Seoul, 7 additional cases (11th floor = 2; contacts = 5) were confirmed. The current total is 146 confirmed cases since [8 Mar 2020]. (11th floor = 89; 10th floor = 1; 9th floor = 1; contacts = 54)

- From Bundang Jesaeng Hospital in Gyeonggi Province, 5 additional cases were confirmed. The current total of 40 confirmed cases since [5 Mar 2020]. (Hospital staff = 22; patients = 7; family/caregivers of patients = 6; contacts outside the hospital = 5)

- In Daegu, every person at high-risk facilities is being tested. 10 additional cases have been confirmed from 3 convalescent hospitals.

- In light of the recent surge in the number of COVID-19 cases in the European region including Italy, Spain, France, the UK, as well as the rise in the number of imported cases found both at airport quarantine and in local communities (total imported cases = 86; imported cases from Europe = 50), stronger entry procedures will be implemented from [22 Mar 2020] for persons traveling from Europe. All persons arriving from Europe will be required to answer a questionnaire on their health condition, get checked for fever, and get tested after being escorted to an appropriate facility -- quarantine facility for persons with symptoms and designated temporary living facilities for those without symptoms. Those whose tests are positive will either be moved to a hospital or a Life Treatment Center based on the severity level assessed for each case. In principle, Korean citizens or resident aliens who test negative go into self-quarantine at their place of residence. Those without a place of residence in Korea will be quarantined at a facility. Foreigners who are temporarily staying in Korea for a short time will subject to active monitoring during their stay in Korea. Travel histories of all travelers entering Korea will be provided to healthcare providers via the International Traveler Information System for reference. The names of all entrants will be provided to local public health centers for a more active monitoring of potential imported cases for the 1st 14 days upon their arrival.

- The KCDC also strongly recommended that all non-urgent international travel plans be canceled or postponed. Persons who are unable to avoid traveling for a critical reason are advised to refrain from visiting any enclosed facilities or healthcare facilities. Upon entering Korea, they should voluntarily disclose any symptoms and their international travel history and follow appropriate guidelines and instructions, including minimizing movement and interpersonal contact for 14 days.

- In light of the continued emergence of outbreaks in healthcare facilities, call centers, and church clusters, the KCDC stressed the importance of strengthening prevention management for such community facilities. The KCDC urged people to continue to follow social distancing and personal hygiene practices. To minimize contact with other people, attending religious gatherings or visiting any place with a lot of people in an enclosed space should be refrained. The KCDC also recommended that workplaces enable and actively encourage employees to use remote working options. Those with fever or respiratory symptoms should refrain completely from going to work or school and watch their symptoms or the next 3-4 days.

- Any person who suspect onset COVID-19 symptoms are advised to call the KCDC call center (1339) or local call centers (area code +120), ask a local public health center, or visit a screening facility, before visiting a regular healthcare provider directly. All persons who visit a screening center should arrive wearing a mask and in their own car if possible.

- In a recent survey, 58.4% of respondents said they have heard hate speech related to COVID-19 within the last week, and 62.6% said they fear the blame or discrimination they might face if they become infected. KCDC reminded everyone that COVID-19 is an infectious disease that can affect anyone and that infection shouldn't be grounds for blame or social stigma. The KCDC asked citizens to send warm regards and encouragement to those who are affected by the virus, including confirmed patients and their families, people under self-quarantine, and recovered patients. Excess blame can cause patients to suffer the aftermath of psychological trauma even after recovering from the infection. Such a culture can potentially result in people refusing to be tested for the fear of social stigma, causing in turn more infection to spread to local communities. The transparent, timely disclosure of infection-related information is provided for the purpose of infection prevention only, as it helps to find potential cases unable to be traced by epidemiological investigation by informing those who may have been exposed to the virus. The KCDC asked reporters and others to refrain from citing or reporting on privacy-sensitive information or information that can identify the patient.

[Note that the reporting interval is now midnight to midnight, presenting the full calendar day. In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 147 cases and 8 deaths as compared with yesterday's 24 hour period (19-20 Mar 2020) when there were 87 newly confirmed cases. Unfortunately the 24 hour case count has returned to above 100; hopefully this will be a continuing trend toward interruption of local transmission. Daegu continues to stand out as a focal point for transmission with 72.1% of the total cases reported followed by Gyeongbuk with 14.1% of the total cases reported. Looking at recent activity, Daegu reported 46.9% of the newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by Gyeongbuk with 27.2% newly confirmed cases, Seoul reporting 10.2% of the newly confirmed cases and Gyeonggi with 8.2% of the newly confirmed cases. Looking at the graphics on the English language website from 21 mar 2020, one sees the sudden increase in reported cases from Daegu and Gyeongbuk province, albeit the text accompanying the 20 Mar 2020 update doesn't identify a specific cluster as yet. (see https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030 for tables and graphs of the ongoing outbreak.

It is interesting that like China, Korea is identifying increasing numbers of imported cases coming from Europe (and I would suspect they are beginning to notice a similar trend in people coming from the USA). Like China there is strict surveillance and follow-up of these individuals, reversing the pattern of the western countries strengthening screenings of individuals from South Korea and China. Obvious concerns re: initiating new clusters that might escape into the community.

The head of civil protection, Angelo Borrelli, has announced that he has signed an order for the advance payment of pensions in post offices. Payment will be made from [26 to 31 Mar 2020] and so in the coming months.

Regarding health monitoring related to the spread of the new coronavirus [SARS-CoV-2] on the national territory, there are 47 021 total cases. At the moment 37 860 people are positive for the virus. 5129 people have recovered. There are 16 020 patients hospitalized with symptoms, 2655 in intensive care, and 19 185 are in home isolation.

There have been 4032 reported deaths, however this number can only be confirmed after the Istituto Superiore di Sanita has established the actual cause of the death.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 47 021 cases, including 4032 deaths, up from 41 035 cases and 3405 deaths reported on 18 Mar 2020. The 24-hour change between 19 and 20 Mar 2020 was 5986 newly confirmed cases, compared with 5322 newly confirmed cases between 18 and 19 Mar 2020. Cases continue to be concentrated in Lombardy (22 264), the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna (5968), and Venice (4031), all in the northern part of the country, but there are signs the case loads may be increasing outside of these 3 northern provinces. While it had looked as though other provinces were picking up, unfortunately things have not slowed down in the northern provinces with their representing 68.6% of all newly confirmed cases in the country. There is an excellent interactive map at http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1 to visualize the caseloads per region in near real time.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was changed to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of non-essential businesses. As for seeing an impact, one shouldn't expect to see an impact until at least one incubation period has passed, as there are newly infected individuals who are still in their incubation period for up to 14 days. That being said, there is no trend for stabilizing or decreasing the daily number of new cases that are confirmed. As mentioned before, the Public Health world is looking at Italy to see if this is feasible and if it has an impact in terms of slowing down transmission of the virus.

C. Iran: 19 644 cases, 1433 deaths
Date: Fri 20 Mar 2020
Source: Daily Nation, Agence France-Presse (AFP) report [edited]
https://www.nation.co.ke/news/world/Irans-coronavirus-death-toll-rises-to-1433/1068-5498370-cgi8a8z/index.html


Iran said Friday [20 Mar r2020] that coronavirus has killed 149 more people in the Islamic republic, raising the country's official death toll from the disease to 1433. Deputy Health Minister Alireza Raisi said 1237 more cases have been confirmed over the past 24 hours and 19 644 people are now known to have been infected in Iran, one of the world's worst-hit countries.

The latest figures come as Iranians celebrate Nowruz, the Persian New Year [20 Mar 2020] which ushers in a 2-week holiday during which Iran's roads are normally filled with people visiting family. The authorities had urged the public to avoid family visits or days out this year to stem the spread of the coronavirus. But footage aired by state television showed hundreds of vehicles pouring out of Tehran on Thursday evening [19 Mar 2020].

Remote sensors installed at tollbooths checked the body temperatures of motorists and their passengers, but there was no mass stay-home as called for by the authorities.

The number of cases continues to grow at an alarming rate, with reports of deaths of many notable figures in the country and of international fame. This seems to be a repetitive story, countries' health sectors being overwhelmed with the pandemic. Wuhan China began, followed by Italy, and now Iran.

The disturbing news is the significant translocation of the population, which unfortunately may lead to continued intra country/provincial exportations of the virus.

Abstract
--------
A new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has recently emerged to cause a human pandemic. Whereas molecular diagnostic tests were rapidly developed, serologic assays are still lacking, yet urgently needed. Validated serologic assays are important for contact tracing, identifying the viral reservoir and epidemiological studies. Here, we developed serological assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing, spike- and nucleocapsid-specific antibodies. Using serum samples from patients with PCR-confirmed infections of SARS-CoV-2, other coronaviruses, or other respiratory pathogenic infections, we validated and tested various antigens in different in-house and commercial ELISAs. We demonstrate that most PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals seroconverted, as revealed by sensitive and specific in-house ELISAs. We found that commercial S1 IgG or IgA ELISAs were of lower specificity while sensitivity varied between the 2, with IgA showing higher sensitivity. Overall, the validated assays described here can be instrumental for the detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies for diagnostic, seroepidemiological, and vaccine evaluation studies

["Long awaited" serologic testing should now be available shortly. This will greatly facilitate many of the outstanding questions, such as true infectivity rate and true case fatality ratio. Information on the proportion of sub-clinical/asymptomatic patients has been a noticeable gap. While much has been learned about this organism in almost 3 months, there still remains much to learn. And as pointed out by the authors, serology will be necessary to evaluate the efficacy of a new vaccine. - Mod.MPP]

A. Cruise Ships - Australia
Date: Sat 21 Mar 2020 3:56PM AEDT
Source: News.com.au [edited]
https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/health-problems/coronavirus-australia-five-cruises-from-sydney-infected-with-covid19/news-story/5c0e5a4e6f68112f160f628ee5437768


NSW [New South Wales] Health has named 4 cruise ships as having confirmed cases of coronavirus with one of those ships having done 2 trips, bringing the total number of cruises identified to 5. More than 2600 passengers who were on the Ruby Princess cruise ship, operated by Princess Cruises, disembarked in Sydney on Thursday morning [19 Mar 2020]. At least 3 passengers and a crew member have since tested positive for coronavirus.

A couple who left the ship in Sydney and then flew to Darwin are among the positive results. In an update on Saturday afternoon [21 Mar 2020], the health department said, "NSW Health has identified 4 separate cruises affected by COVID-19, in addition to the Ruby Princess reported previously."

The additional cruises are as follows:
- Ovation of the Seas, leaving Sydney on [11 Mar 2020] and returning on [18 Mar 2020]
- Voyager of the Seas, leaving Sydney on [25 Feb 2020] and returning on [7 Mar 2020]
- Voyager of the Seas, leaving Sydney on [7 Mar 2020] and returning on [18 Mar 2020]
- Celebrity Solstice, confirmed case joined the ship in Auckland on [10 Mar 2020], docked in Sydney on [20 Mar 2020]

NSW Health said all passengers are being contacted to ensure self-quarantine although self isolation of "well passengers" on the trip arriving back on [7 Mar 2020] is no longer required as the 14-day advisory period has passed.

Ovation of the Seas
-------------------
NSW Health has identified a 67-year-old man who travelled from Canada before boarding a week-long cruise from Sydney on [11 Mar 2020] to [18 Mar 2020] as being diagnosed with coronavirus [COVID-19]. The Ovation of the Seas trip did not stop at any overseas locations.

"There are no known linked cases, no evidence of an outbreak of respiratory illness on the ship, or people who developed symptoms on the last day of the cruise," the health department said in a statement on Saturday [21 Mar 2020] . "The ship is now at sea with only crew on board." Passengers are advised to be alert for the development of any symptoms and should self-quarantine.

Voyager of the Seas
-------------------
Passengers on back-to-back Voyager of the Seas trips have tested positive for COVID-19. The 1st case was a young woman in her 20s travelling from [25 Feb 2020] to [7 Mar 2020]. The cruise ship visited the South Pacific and New Zealand. "There are no known linked cases, and no evidence of an outbreak of respiratory illness on board," NSW Health said. At 6.30am on Saturday [21 Mar 2020] it had been 14 days since the ship arrived back in Sydney. "Although self-isolation of well passengers is no longer required, all passengers are being contacted with advice to seek COVID-19 testing if unwell," the state's health department said.

Earlier on Saturday [21 Mar 2020], health authorities sent an email advising Voyager of the Seas passengers that a passenger was "infectious while on the ship" for the [7 Mar 2020] to [18 Mar 2020] cruise. A 66-year-old man from South Australia was confirmed as having the coronavirus on Friday [20 Mar 2020]. He is in a Sydney hospital. "There are no known linked cases and no evidence of an outbreak of respiratory illness on board," NSW Health repeated.

The department urged those who travelled on the Royal Caribbean-operated cruise ship, that arrived in Sydney on Wednesday [18 Mar 2020], to self-isolate for 14 days at home following the revelation. The Voyager of the Seas had taken passengers on an 11-night South Pacific cruise. Royal Caribbean sent a statement to guests "in conjunction with NSW Public Health and in an abundance of caution" in the early hours of Saturday [21 Mar 2020] morning. "This person was diagnosed after disembarking and was infectious while on the ship," the health department said in the email," seen by http://news.com.au. All passengers have been advised they are "considered a close contact" and needed to remain in home isolation for a fortnight after they disembarked, up to the morning of [1 Apr 2020].

"We are working with public health authorities in Australia and New Zealand. We appreciate their efforts and are co-operating with their requests," a Royal Caribbean International spokesperson told news.com.au on Saturday [21 Mar 2020]. The ship was called into Sydney early on Tuesday [17 Mar 2020] for a medical evacuation after a guest suffered a stroke. It resumed sailing before returning to Circular Quay on Wednesday [18 Mar 2020].

Celebrity Solstice
------------------
Celebrity Solstice, which docked in Sydney on Friday [20 Mar 2020], is the 4th of the vessels to have a passenger diagnosed with the coronavirus. "New Zealand has advised that a male passenger on the Celebrity Solstice, which docked in Sydney on [20 Mar 2020], was reported today to have COVID-19," NSW Health said on Saturday [21 Mar 2020]. "The case had joined the ship at the beginning of the cruise in Auckland on [10 Mar 2020] and left it in Dunedin on [15 Mar 2020]. "There are no known linked cases and no evidence of an outbreak of respiratory illness on board, all passengers are being contacted to ensure self-quarantine and to provide advice to monitor for symptoms."

[The cruise ship sagas continue... One can't help but wonder how compliant people are with voluntary self-quarantine as a recommendation. It awaits to be seen if there are chains of transmission that lead back to passengers on one of these cruise ships. As I said in yesterday's post, given the nature of this pandemic organism (SARS-CoV-2) that seems to transmit rapidly and somewhat silently before the storm, one has to seriously consider if there should be a moratorium on cruise ship sailings. - Mod.MPP]

B. Hong Kong 48 new cases in one day
Date: Fri 20 Mar 2020 23:55 HKT
Source: Government of the Hong Kong SAR, Centre for Health Protection press release [abridged, edited]
https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202003/20/P2020032000844.htm


The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) announced that as of 4pm today ([20 Mar 2020]), the CHP is investigating 48 additional confirmed cases of COVID-19, taking the number of cases to 257 in Hong Kong so far (comprising 256 confirmed cases and one probable case).

The Public Health Laboratory Services Branch of the CHP provides testing for 5000 samples from the relevant persons per week. Persons under quarantine aged 65 or above or persons under quarantine residing with elderly persons aged 65 or above are target individuals at this stage. If a sample tests positive, the CHP will notify the person concerned and arrange for admission to a public hospital for treatment as early as possible. In general, if no notification is received within three working days after returning a sample, it means the test result is negative and the person concerned is required to continue the quarantine until the quarantine period ends.

Today's [20 Mar 2020] cases involve 26 males and 22 females aged between 4 and 69. Among them, 35 had travel history during the incubation period. For case details, please see Annex I [annexes are available at the source URL above]. The CHP's epidemiological investigations and relevant contact tracing on the confirmed cases are ongoing. For the progress on the contact tracing of the cases, please see Annex II.

For information on flights that patients of the confirmed cases have taken, please refer to the following website: (http://www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/flights_trains_en.pdf). Passengers who travelled on the same flights and sat within 2 seats surrounding those patients are urged to call the CHP hotline 2125 1111 and 2125 1122.

The CHP again urged members of the public to maintain an appropriate social distance with other people as far as possible in their daily lives. In particular, they should go out less and avoid social activities such as meal gatherings or other gatherings to reduce the chance of contacting infected persons, who may not present any symptoms, and minimise the risk of outbreak clusters emerging in the community.

A spokesman for the CHP said, "In view of proliferation of the disease and continuous increase in the number of cases reported around the world, members of the public are strongly urged to avoid all non-essential travel outside Hong Kong." The spokesman said, "The CHP strongly urges the public to maintain at all times strict personal and environmental hygiene, which is key to personal protection against infection and prevention of the spread of the disease in the community. On a personal level, members of the public should wear a surgical mask when having respiratory symptoms, taking public transport or staying in crowded places. They should also perform hand hygiene frequently, especially before touching the mouth, nose, or eyes.

"As for household environmental hygiene, members of the public are advised to maintain drainage pipes properly, and regularly pour water into drain outlets (U-traps); cover all floor drain outlets when they are not in use; after using the toilet, they should put the toilet lid down before flushing to avoid spreading germs."

Moreover, the Government has launched the website "COVID-19 Thematic Website" (http://www.coronavirus.gov.hk) for announcing the latest updates on various news on the COVID-19 infection and health advice to help the public understand the latest updates.

[It appears that similar to China and South Korea, recent upticks in numbers of cases of confirmed infection with the SARS-CoV-2 are related to imported cases. In this case 35 of the 48 newly confirmed cases were in international travelers. Checking Annex I, there were only 6 individuals without a history of travel and no known epidemiologic link to another case. Annex II provides a very detailed history of epidemiologic links of each of the identified patients. - Mod.MPP]

[7] WHO situation report 60 (as of 20 Mar 2020)
Date: Fri 20 Mar 2020

https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200320-sitrep-60-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=8894045a_2


*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 00:00 CET

Highlights
----------
- Six new countries/territories/areas (African Region [2], and Region of the Americas [2], and Western Pacific Region [2]) have reported cases of COVID19.

- To increase access to reliable information, WHO has partnered with WhatsApp and Facebook to launch a WHO Health Alert messaging service. This service will provide the latest news and information on COVID-19, including details on symptoms and how people can protect themselves. The Health Alert service is now available in English and will be introduced in other languages next week. To access it, send the word "hi" to the following number on WhatsApp: +41 798 931 892.

- The 1st vaccine trial has begun just 60 days after the genetic sequence of the virus was shared by China. This is an incredible achievement. To ensure clear evidence of which treatments are most effective, WHO and its partners are organizing a large international study, called the Solidarity Trial, in many countries to compare different treatments.

- WHO and Global Citizen launched #TogetherAtHome, a virtual, no-contact concert series to promote physical distancing and action for global health. Chris Martin, lead singer of Coldplay, kicked it off earlier this week with a performance from his home. More Solidarity Sessions are planned to promote health, show support for people who are staying at home to protect themselves and others from COVID-19, and encourage donations to the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund. (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/donate)

These data come from Table 1: Countries, territories or areas with reported laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths. Data as of [12:00 AM 20 Mar 2020], available at the source URL above.

Terms:
- Community transmission is evidenced by chains of transmission for a large number of cases, or by increasing positive tests through routine screening of samples.
- Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.
- Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside `the location of reporting.
- Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.
- Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined).

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside China continues to grow and now totals 174. This includes 15 countries (including 3 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 58 countries (including 6 territories) from the European region, 8 from the Southeast Asia region, 19 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 42 countries (including 10 territories) from the Americas region, and 32 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

Looking at the European region, transmission was at a very low level until 22 Feb 2020, when Italy reported an increase from 9 cases to 76 cases overnight (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200223-sitrep-34-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=44ff8fd3_2, now in less than 1 month, the total number of cases in Europe has surpassed 100 000 cases (compare with it taking almost 3 months for the global case count to reach 100 000). Italy accounts for 39.2% of the total confirmed cases in the region and 30.4% of the newly confirmed case in the 24 hours covered by this report. Spain, Germany, and France account for 37.3% of the total reported cases and 31.3% of the newly confirmed cases.

Sobering information is the time it took to reach the 1st 100 000 cases (almost 3 months) and the time it took to reach the 2nd 100 000 cases -- 12 days and at the rate we are progressing, arrival at 300 000 cases will be in the next 24 hours (see the Worldometer data in section [1] above).

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported outside of China, by date of report and WHO region through [19 Mar 2020], at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic in China, juxtaposed with the increasing epidemics outside of China. One sees the contribution of the ongoing epidemics in Europe and now the increasing cases in the Americas region, fueled by the USA but other countries are following suit. It would be very nice to see an epidemic curve based on date of onset of illness.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: it is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the Hopkins table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4). - Mod.MPP]
