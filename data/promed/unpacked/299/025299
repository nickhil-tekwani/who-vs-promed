Spray park illness cases keep rising
---------------------------------------
Health officials say the parasitic illness that originated at the Seneca
Lake State Park spray-ground has spread to more than 3000 people and could
be one of the worst outbreaks of a waterborne sicknesses in the United
States in a decade.
The last time a similar outbreak affected more people, nearly 5500, was in
1995 in Georgia. Contaminated drinking water in the Milwaukee area sickened
more than 400 000 people in 1993, according to the Centers for Disease Control.
The State Health Department said the number of reported illnesses possibly
linked to the park is now 3131, with 394 cases confirmed as the intestinal
illness cryptosporidiosis. Those affected have come from 32 counties across
the state, and from several states, Mexico and Canada. Nearly 1000 people
from Ontario County have reported symptoms, along with 417 from Seneca, 650
from Wayne, and 175 from Yates.
"We recognize this is a significant outbreak, and our priority is to
continue working with counties to increase public awareness about the
precautions everyone should take to stop further spread of illness," said
state Health Department spokesman Jeffrey Hammond.
Recreational water illnesses aren't uncommon, but in his more than 2
decades as an area pediatrician, Dr. Robert Weinberg of Geneva can't recall
seeing a single case of cryptosporidiosis. Symptoms of the illness include
diarrhea, abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, fever, headache and loss of
appetite. "I can't recall a case [of cryptosporidiosis] in children
before," said Weinberg, a pediatrician with Finger Lakes Medical Associates.
Although the spray park closed on 15 Aug 2005, the number of reported cases
continues to rise, with increased reporting and the spread of the disease
through secondary means, such as contact with an individual carrying the
highly infectious disease. But even as the number of confirmed cases
continues to rise, Weinberg suspects the disease will dissipate within the
next 3 to 4 weeks. More and more people are becoming aware of how to stop
its spread, he said, explaining that preventative measures include washing
hands after using the bathroom and before meals and disinfecting surfaces
regularly. State health officials have been reluctant to comment on the
cause of the outbreak, noting that they are still investigating how
cryptosporidium ended up in 2 storage tanks that supply water to the park.

[The reporting of cases from Mexico and Canada shows that the infection has
been spread to other countries by visitors to New York, and more cases from
other countries will most probably be reported. The number of suspected
cases now exceeds 3000, but it is important to notice that few have been
confirmed, and patients with diarrhea who have visited New York will
probably be diagnosed as having cryptosporidiosis even without
investigation. - Mod.EP]
