Schmallenberg: Investigated samples and new evidence
----------------------------------------------------
The Institute of Virology and Immunoprophylaxis (IVI) has received, up to 19 Aug 2012, submissions from 71 farms in 18 different cantons related to notified abortions or foetal malformations. This included a total of 74 diagnosed animals: 37 cattle, 23 sheep, and 14 goats. So far, only one malformed calf tested positive for the Schmallenberg virus [SBV].

Acute cases in adult cattle with diarrhea and fever have recently been reported from 77 farms, 72 of which tested positive for SBV. [The figures, as of 12 Aug 2012, were respectively 44 and 34]. The laboratory results have been based either on the detection of the virus or of specific antibodies.

[Thanks to the active surveillance undertaken by the Swiss veterinary authorities, the SBV situation there is clear, transparent and updated. The spread of the virus is continuing and indeed increased: on 12 Aug 2012, the reported number of SBV-positive cattle farms with acute clinical signs (fever and diarrhea), in north-west Switzerland (see map at the source URL), was 34; during one week, the number more than doubled (38 new affected farms). Is this spread limited to Switzerland? Active surveillance may provide the answer, if/when undertaken in neighbouring countries and in other parts of Europe which have not been affected during the previous vector season (2011). Subscribers may recollect the multiple diarrhea cases seen during July 2012 in bovines from north-west Ukraine; ProMED-mail's request for information on the etiology of the event have, so far, remained unanswered.

Interestingly, according to "unpublished data" included in a letter to Veterinary Record (Ref 1), novel clinical manifestations have recently been noted in Israeli cattle, which could also be attributed to Simbu teratogenic serogroup infections. Reportedly, they included adult cows with encephalitis and increased mortality of periparturient cows in herds with a high level of fetal or calf malformations. Other possibly associated clinical signs, such as fever, milk yield reduction, abortion, fetal resorption, exemplified by empty cows and increased numbers of insemination failures were also seen. In addition, apparently healthy calves and adult cows were found Akabane-virus positive in the blood and brain. The issue is, reportedly, under investigation; details and definite results, when available, will be appreciated.
