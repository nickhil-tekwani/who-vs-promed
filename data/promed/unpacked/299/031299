Between January 2017 and December 2018, 6 countries and territories in the Region of the Americas reported confirmed cases of yellow fever: Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, and Peru. The number of cases reported during this period in the Region of the Americas exceeded the number reported in several decades.

In 2019, Brazil and Peru reported confirmed cases that occurred between December 2018 and January 2019. The following is a summary of the epidemiological situation in both of these countries.

In Brazil, it is currently the period which has historically been recognized as having the highest transmission (seasonal period), which occurs between December and May. The expansion of the historical area of yellow fever transmission to areas previously considered risk-free led to 2 waves of transmission (Figure 1), one during the 2016-2017 seasonal period, with 778 human cases, including 262 deaths, and another during the 2017-2018 seasonal period, with 1376 human cases, including 483 deaths.

In the current seasonal period (2018-2019), 12 confirmed human cases, including 6 deaths, have been reported in the municipalities of Eldorado (9 cases), Jacupiranga (1 case), Iporanga (1 case), and Cananeia (1 case), all of which are located in the southern part of Sao Paulo State. Among these confirmed cases, 83 percent (10/12) are male, the median age is 45 years, and 83 percent (10/12) are rural workers. Additionally, the Parana Secretariat of Health reported that the tests performed on dead monkeys in Antonina, on the Parana coast, were positive for yellow fever.

Human cases reported during the current 2018-2019 seasonal period in 4 municipalities in Sao Paulo State, as well as the confirmation of epizootics in the state of Parana, mark the beginning of what could be a 3rd cycle and a progression of the outbreak towards the Southeast and South regions of the country (Figure 2).

Given the gradual geographical expansion of the epizootic wave that Brazil has faced during the last 2 seasonal periods, the country has had to adapt its immunization policies for yellow fever. The number of areas with recommended vaccination has increased from 3526 municipalities in 2010 to 4469 municipalities in 2018, and to the entire country starting in 2019. In line with the World Health Organization guidelines, Brazil has adopted a single dose vaccination scheme for yellow fever since April 2017. The use of fractional doses to respond to outbreaks and the risk of urbanization of yellow fever, especially in large cities, was also adopted. This strategy was implemented in 77 municipalities with the greatest risk for yellow fever in the states of Sao Paulo (54 municipalities), Rio de Janeiro (15 municipalities), and Bahia (8 municipalities).

As of epidemiological week (EW) 39 of 2018, preliminary results of the mass vaccination campaign against yellow fever indicate that 13.3 million people in Sao Paulo, 6.5 million in Rio de Janeiro, and 1.85 million in Bahia states were vaccinated, which represent vaccination coverage of 53.6 percent, 55.6 percent and 55.0 percent, respectively.

In Peru, between EW 1 and EW 52 of 2018, there were 20 cases of yellow fever reported, including 6 deaths; of the total cases, 10 were laboratory-confirmed, and 10 remain under investigation. This figure is higher than that reported during the same period in 2017 when 6 cases of yellow fever were reported. Of the total confirmed cases, 11 are male and 9 are female.

In 2018, the confirmed cases were from the departments with forests: Loreto, San Martin, Ucayali, and Madre de Dios.

The occurrence of the 1st confirmed human cases of yellow fever in Brazil marks the beginning of the seasonal period (December to May) and, therefore, the highest risk of transmission to unvaccinated humans. Thus, the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) reiterates its recommendation that Member States with areas at-risk for yellow fever continue efforts to immunize the at-risk populations and to take the necessary actions to keep travelers informed and vaccinated prior to traveling to areas where yellow fever vaccination is recommended.

The guidelines pertaining to laboratory diagnosis and vaccinations are the same as those published in the 7 Dec 2018 PAHO/WHO Epidemiological Update 2.

[The situation for Brazil is of concern, since the yellow fever (YF) transmission season for the current year (2019) is just beginning. The percent vaccination coverages for the affected municipalities in Sao Paulo state are not mentioned. State-wide, the 6.5 million individuals already vaccinated represent just 53.6 percent coverage of the population, far short of the 80 or more percent or more necessary to provide good YF coverage. One hopes that the nation-wide vaccination campaign planned for this year (2019) will focus on the areas where the YF cases have occurred. Since 10 of the 12 cases occurred in rural residents, they represent spill-over of the sylvan (forest) transmission cycle, as was the case in the previous 2 YF outbreaks in Brazil. The circumstances under which the other 2 non-rural infected individuals acquired their infections are not mentioned but perhaps occurred during visits to more rural, forested areas. These sylvan YF cases are of concern because of the risk of introduction of the virus into urban and suburban settings where _Aedes aegypti_ vector mosquitoes are abundant and could initiate a rapidly-spreading urban outbreak.

Although the Peruvian cases occurred last year (2018), YF virus is endemic in forests of the Amazon Basin areas, and there is an ongoing risk of cases if individuals resident or visiting in these area are not vaccinated.
