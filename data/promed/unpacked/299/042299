Correction: The exotic species identified is _Aedes camptorhynchus_
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for publicising the information about exotic mosquitoes of public
health significance being found near Gisborne. However, the species was
actually the southern saltmarsh mosquito, _Aedes camptorhynchus_. This was
confirmed by Professor Richard Russell an Australian mosquito expert.

Mosquito Containment Programme Recommended
-------------------------------------------
On 13 Oct 2000, an expert Technical Advisory Group (TAG) to the Ministry of
Health has recommended that a programme to contain the exotic southern
saltmarsh mosquito, _Aedes camptorhynchus_, should begin as soon as
possible, while a decision is being considered about future management of
the mosquito in the Gisborne area. The TAG, which was initially set up to
advise on steps to be taken after the mosquito was first identified in
Hawke's Bay in December 1998, includes various New Zealand experts as well
as Australian mosquito expert, Associate Professor Brian Kay. [The southern
saltmarsh mosquito has been declared an unwanted organism in New Zealand. In
Australia it is thought to be the main carrier of Ross River virus. To date
there have been no confirmed cases of Ross River virus in Napier or
Gisborne. The southern saltmarsh mosquito is known to be an "aggressive"
biter. The Ministry of Health advises people in the Gisborne area to avoid
being bitten by any mosquitoes by screening open doors and windows, using
insect sprays or mosquito coils indoors, wearing long clothing and repellent
when outdoors.
The recommendation comes after an intensive survey of 9000 hectares of land
in the Gisborne area identified 15 areas where _Aedes camptorhynchus_ larvae
were found and 4 sites where adult _Aedes camptorhynchus_ were captured.
Deputy Chief Technical Officer (Health) Sally Gilbert said the results of
surveys to date suggest that the southern saltmarsh mosquito is limited to a
36 hectare area around the Wherowhero Lagoon at Muriwai, 20 kilometres south
of Gisborne, plus a very small area of 0.6 ha directly opposite at Sponge
Bay. She said a containment programme, as recommended by TAG would include
treatment of any site returning positive samples, as well as disinsection of
all aircraft departing Gisborne. "Although the survey has confirmed that
there are limited potential breeding sites in the Gisborne area, and the
existing establishment is a long way from the airport, we don't want to take
any chances. While the mosquito is largely limited to the Wherowhero Lagoon
area, we have a good chance of containing the spread of _Aedes
camptorhynchus_." "The containment approach was also employed in Hawke's Bay
using the biological spray Bti, until the decision was made to progress with
eradication. Bti, which is a biological spray, has undergone a full health
impact assessment. It is specific to mosquito, blackfly (known as sandflies
in New Zealand) and gnat larvae. The spray leaves no long term residue and
has no known impact on the environment or people." [_Bacillus thuringiensis_
(Bt) strains and varieties are pathogenic to a number of insect pests. The
discovery of _B. thuringiensis israelensis_ (Bti), a variety specific to
_Diptera_ (especially mosquitoes and blackflies) in Israel in 1978, has led
to the development of many products based on this bacterium. These products
have been used extensively in mosquito and biting fly control programmes,
especially in Australia, Africa, USA and Germany.
Associate Professor Brian Kay said the discovery of the southern saltmarsh
larvae in Gisborne through routine surveillance was clear evidence that the
national surveillance programme was working well. "It was pleasing to see
that an action plan was put in place, and surveys began within 72 hours of
the Ministry of Health being advised on the find. "It's also encouraging to
know that no adult mosquitos have been found in Napier since April, and
tests have shown that 8 out of the 9 mosquitoes captured prior to
April were infertile as a result of the treatment programme in Hawke's Bay."
TAG advised the Ministry that information at this time suggested the
eradication programme was achieving results and recommended it continue
pending a long term decision about the action required in Gisborne.
