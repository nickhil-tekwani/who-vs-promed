Regarding comments in the MMWR Editorial Note, "The findings in this report are subject to at least 4 limitations. First, co-circulating arboviruses (that is, dengue and JEV) share the same vector and cause similar symptoms."

In fact, both DEN [dengue] and CHIK [chikungunya] viruses share the same vectors, _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_, while JEV [Japanese encephalitis virus] is transmitted exclusively by _Culex_ genera (_Culex_ subgenera) mosquitoes.

[ProMED-mail thanks Michael Bangs for alertly noting the error in the MMWR editorial note, and sending in the correction. The habits of _Aedes_ DENV and CHKV vectors and _Culex_ JEV vectors are quite different, although both can be found concurrently in villages in Cambodia. - Mod.TY]
