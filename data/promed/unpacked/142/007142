Germany's national disease control center says another person has
died in the European _E. coli_ outbreak and 160 more people have been
reported ill, but that the rate of new sicknesses is continuing to
decline.

The Robert Koch Institute said today that 2808 people, 722 of whom
are suffering from hemolytic-uremic syndrome that can cause kidney
failure, have now been reported sickened in Germany, the country at
the epicenter of the _E. coli_ [O104:H4] outbreak whose origin has not
yet been found.

The WHO says 97 others have fallen sick in 12 other European
countries, as well as 3 in the USA. A total of 27 people have died, 26
in Germany and 1 in Sweden.

Though the number of those sickened is still rising, the Koch
institute says the newly occurring cases being reported have been
dropping for several days.

[2] Enteroaggregative phenotype

Germany's deadly _E. coli_ [O104] strain is found mainly in humans
rather than animals, the Tagesspiegel newspaper reported on Tue 7 Jun
2011, citing scientific research. The bacterium, responsible for [now
27] deaths and over 2000 contaminations, does not belong to typical
strains of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC), but rather to an
enteroaggregative _E. coli_, known as EAEC, characterized by
substantial diarrhea.

EAEC strains are not found in the digestive track of cattle, but
rather in that of humans, according to Lothar Beutin, an expert at
Germany's Federal Institute for Risk Assessment. "Such pathogens are
well adapted to man," said Beutin, who believes it very unlikely the
bacteria could have been passed on by liquid manure from animals. The
bacteria is especially dangerous to man because it sticks to the human
gut and produces poison known as Shiga toxins.

[3] Outbreak strain genetics
Date: Tue 7 Jun 2011

The culprit behind Europe's deadly _E. coli_ outbreak appears to be
an evolved and extremely toxic version of a bug first identified in
Munster, Germany, in 2001, according to genetic analyses done by 2
separate teams of scientists.

Identifying the bug's ancestor may help scientists identify the
origin, spread and source of the disease. Such genetic comparisons
could also help researchers explain the biological mechanism that
makes the 2011 bacterium so virulent, while providing clues for future
diagnostic tests or effective drugs.

Researchers said the quick genetic analysis will help unlock the
mystery. "Everything we know so far indicates it is an evolved
strain," said Alexander Mellmann of the University Hospital of
Munster, who was involved in one of the genetic analyses. "If it was
completely unknown, we'd struggle a lot more in our effort to fight
it."

In addition to Dr Mellmann's group, a separate team from BGI,
formerly known as the Beijing Genomics Institute, and University
Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf compared the genetic material of the
2001 and 2011 strains. They found that 7 genes crucial to both bugs'
survival are identical, as are 12 virulence/fitness genes shared by
both.

The 2001 strain caused fewer than 5 identified cases worldwide, and
scientists never did identify its natural reservoir, where a new
strain of the _E. coli_ bug can originate, such as in cattle. But the
genetic analysis showed that as the 2001 bug likely swapped genetic
material with other bacterial strains, some big changes occurred.

The 2011 version turns out to be resistant to 8 classes of
antimicrobial agents, including penicillins, streptomycin, and
sulfonamides. The likely reason is that rapid evolution "resulted in
the gain of more genes during the last 10 years" that conferred
immunity against many more antimicrobial agents, according to BGI.

The twin sets of genetic analysis of the 2011 bug were conducted at
unprecedented speed thanks to a new kind of gene-sequencing machine
used by both teams. Most DNA sequencers use light beams to read the
code of an organism's genome, and the process can take a week to
complete. A newer machine, known as an ion torrent, does the job more
quickly. For example, it took 3 days to complete the process of
sequencing the 5.4 million "letters" of the latest bug's genetic
code.

The outbreak organism is probably better referred to as
enteroaggregative verocytotoxin-producing _E. coli_ (EAggEC VTEC)
O104:H4 since it has characteristics of both EHEC and EAEC.

Such organisms are rare but have been linked to outbreaks of
hemolytic uremic syndrome before as apparently first reported in 1998
regarding an outbreak of HUS in France (1). Like our current isolate,
this strain (2), was subsequently found to be a hybrid of
enteroaggregative and enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ strains but was a
O111:H2 serotype. It was eae negative and produced Shiga toxin 2, not
Shiga toxin 1.

The stx2 gene of the organism showed 100 percent homology with an
O157:H7 stx2 gene. The O111:H2 hybrid was shown to demonstrate the
typical aggregative pattern of EAEC as described below. No mention of
whether the O111:H2 strain contained the "high-pathogenicity island"
(HPI) seen in _Yersinia_ species (pestis, enterocolitica and
pseudotuberculosis), which apparently was found in the current
outbreak strain. This HPI has been described before in pathogenic _E.
coli_ but not in EHEC strains (3).

The outbreak in France (1), however, was more typical of usual HUS
outbreaks, involving mostly children. Additionally there was no
mention of prominent neurological symptoms as in our current outbreak
strain.

Enteroaggregative _E. coli_ were initially described in 1987 as an
isolate from a Peruvian child with diarrhea and subsequently been
associated with acute and chronic diarrhea in children throughout the
world and as a significant cause of traveler's diarrhea (4) and is
more likely to be resistant to antimicrobials as compared to
enterotoxigenic _E. coli_. These are primarily human pathogens rather
than zoonotic as EHEC strains are.

The EAEC strains appear to be pathogenic via their ability of
aggregate intimately with each other and to cells. One of the
characteristics of EAEC is the ability to form "stacked-brick"
formation when cultured with HEp-2 cells primarily mediated through
`the AggR gene. EAEC strains do not have characteristic O antigens as
EHEC strains do (5).

Although the chimeric combination of genes of the current O104:H4 has
not entirely been reported, ProMED-mail awaits more information
regarding the combination of genes in the hybrid. It is possible that
the aggregative characteristics of the strain may allow it to deliver
more toxin to the host, rather than producing more toxin. Perhaps the
characteristics of the binding of this specific pathogen may allow it
to bind better to adult female intestinal cells, explaining the high
rate of attack in this cohort.
