There are 20,000 families at risk from Bolivian hemorrhagic fever, caused
by Machupo virus, in the Provinces of Cercado and Itenez in the Department
of the Beni. The Ministry of Health [is attempting to ensure they are
taking the necessary precautions. Three suspected deaths have occurred and
only one has been confirmed. Machupo virus is endemic in this region.
Methods of prevention are:
1. clean and weed up to 20-30 metres around houses and to avoid the field
mouse (_Callomys callosus_).
2. avoid contact with faeces and urine from mice and avoid sweeping to
cause dust.
3. hang food up to protect food and protect other areas so as to be
inaccessible to mice.
4. consume only well cooked food.
The [virus can be contracted from contaminated food, airborne dust and
sexual contact. People with clinical symptoms should not have sex. Clinical
symptoms in humans are; temperature greater than 38C, headaches, and
similar to flu with fever, vomiting, and vomiting with blood. You should
visit the health centre as there are sufficient medications available.
Chances of death are high, between 19 and 68% of all people that contract
the disease. The disease is endemic to these provinces and the Ministry of
Health does not think it will spread to other regions.

Just before the 1970's, the Provinces of Itenez and Mamore in the Beni were
affected by this disease. It begins with minor symptoms of a cold and then
vital organs: brain, lungs, liver, kidneys, skin begin bleeding, shock,
coma and cardiorespiratory arrest. Deaths occurred mostly in Magdalena,
capital of Itenez, and San Joaquin, capital of Mamore.
Between 1959-1970, 1,500 persons died from hemorrhagic fever, and this set
back development in the Provinces by 20 years, the equivalent of US$40
million. The areas were also affected by people who moved away and
relocated in other regions.
The cause of the haemorrhagic fever epidemic was discovered by the efforts
of nationals and two foreign scientists: Karl Johnson and Ronald MacKenzie,
from the MARU [Middle America Research Institute in Panama. The initial
outbreak was [attributed to years of indiscriminate hunting of the
regional feline, "Tigrillo" or mountain cat.The skins are sold for US$10
and this is enough money to cover the families needs for 2 days. This small
cat is the natural predator of the mouse (_Callomys callosus_). The mouse
is the vector [reservoir of the Machupo virus that causes hemorrhagic
fever. The virus was named after the river that runs close to the city of
San Joaquin.
There are three new cases of probable hemorrhagic fever in the Beni, two in
Cercado and one in Itenez. One person has died. It is alarming, that these
cases have occurred in an area abundant with the mouse and the epidemic
scenary is repeating. The vector could move to new areas and reproduce. The
vector has an insatiable appetite and can affect rice, maize, yuca, bananas
and meat with Machupo virus.
There is a need for monitoring the population of the mouse vector,
education to warn local people of the danger, precautions to be taken with
contaminated food and what people should do if they suspect they have
hemorrhagic fever. Whatever action is taken to avoid this new disaster in
the Beni, it will be priceless in the fight against poverty.
