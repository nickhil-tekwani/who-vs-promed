[The OIE notification does not specify the species involved (the reporting authorities applied a term which does not discriminate between sheep and goats). This missing information is available in the official web-site of the Luxembourg government (in French) at http://www.gouvernement.lu/salle_presse/communiques/2012/02-fevrier/20-moutons/). It indicates that the case relates to a flock of sheep located in the north.

The identification of SBV in Luxembourg is not surprising, in view of the country being surrounded by infected territories (Belgium, Germany, France; see map attached to the OIE notification at the source URL. - Mod.AS]

Information received on 20 Feb 2012 from Prof. Dr. Romano Marabelli, Chief Veterinary Officer, Department for Veterinary Public Health, Food Safety and Collegial Bodies for Health Protection, Ministry of Health, Rome, Italy

Summary
Report type: Immediate notification
Start date: 6 Feb 2012
Date of 1st confirmation of the event: 16 Feb 2012
Report date: 20 Feb 2012
Date submitted to OIE: 20 Feb 2012
Reason for notification: Emerging disease
Morbidity 1 scale 05
Mortality 1 scale 05
Zoonotic impact: No
Causal agent: Schmallenberg virus

New outbreaks
Outbreak 1 (IT Sch 01): Sarmede, Treviso, VENETO
Date of start of the outbreak: 6 Feb 2012
Outbreak status: Continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Farm
Affected animals
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0
Goats / 6 / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0

Affected Population: The number of susceptible animals is the number of breeding goats (one male - 5 females) present on the farm. A pregnant goat delivered one healthy small sized kid, and, due to some complications, died the day after. At necropsy, a dystocic malformed foetus was found, which resulted positive. It was not possible to perform diagnostic examinations on the dead goat.

Summary of outbreaks Total outbreaks: 1

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: The breeding goats present on the farm were born on 1 Feb 2011 and introduced on 27 Apr 2011. The bovine was introduced on 12 Dec 2011 from an Italian farm [see comment]. No other movements or aborted/malformed foetuses were recently registered.

Control measures
Measures applied: No vaccination; No treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Experimental Zooprophylactic Institute (IZS), Teramo (National laboratory)
Tests and results
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Goats / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 16 Feb 2012 / Positive

[This notification confirms the SBV case reported as suspected in ProMED-mail's posting 20120218.1045818. The data provided by the Italian authorities in relation to the dates of the introduction of the goats and cattle into the affected premises are interesting epidemiologically. Since the goats were introduced in April 2011, they were present on the site during the vector season while pregnant. This may explain the appearance of the congenically affected kid. The cattle apparently arrived there after the vector season.

The puberty age of goats is 5 to 9 months; of cattle, 8 to 15 months. In both species, puberty age is influenced by several factors, predominantly genetic (breed).

So far, SBV has been identified in 7 EU member countries: Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, France, UK, Luxembourg and Italy.

For the accumulated OIE information on each of the 1st 5 affected countries, with maps, please go to the following sites:
- Germany (5 follow-up reports, 485 outbreaks): http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=11514 (updated as of 17 Feb 2012).
- Netherlands (5 follow-up reports, 100 outbreaks): http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=11447 (updated as of 14 Feb 2012).
- Belgium (a single follow-up report, 15 outbreaks): http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=11485 (data not updated recently).
- France (no follow-up reports, 29 outbreaks): http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=11568 (data not updated recently).
- UK (3 follow-up reports, 53 outbreaks): http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=11539 (updated as of 17 Feb 2012).

The SBV-affected territories, closest to northern Italy, are east France/south Germany. For an updated SVP map showing all affected countries, see http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/638/tmpempresdownloadmap291.png/.

The true SBV situation and history within the affected countries, their neighbours in western Europe, and elsewhere in Europe and other parts of the eastern hemisphere can be determined only when a validated serological test for mass testing becomes applicable. - Mod.AS]
