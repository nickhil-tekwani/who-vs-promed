I attach here a message I received today from The Game, Fish and Parks
(GF&P) Department officials on the bighorn sheep loss at Custer State Park
in South Dakota. Clearly more needs to be done on this if we are to
understand it.

The results to date are limited and from conversations with Dr Holler at
the Vet Diagnostic Lab. We sacrificed 3 animals, a collared
non-symptomatic ewe, and a yearling ewe observed coughing on 2 Feb [2005],
and a 4-year-old ram observed coughing on 23 Feb [2005]. Histology on the
1st 2 specimens identified bacterial pneumonia in the ewe coughing and none
in the other. Bacteriology was inconclusive. A _Mycoplasma_ spp was
cultured and was sent out for species identification.
The ram was sacrificed and sampled to try and get a positive culture on the
primary pathogen. Again histology was conclusive for bacterial
pneumonia. Gross examination when samples were being collected showed
large adhesions of the anterior right lung lobe to the chest cavity with
large abscesses. Adhesions to the diaphragm were also present. Pneumonia
was extensive. Examination at the lab also showed adhesions to the pericardium.
Gross and histological examinations were consistent with _Pasteurella_
pneumonias observed by Dr. Holler from feedlot domestic lambs. Bacteriology
was only successful in culturing _Arcanobacteria_, which was considered to
be a secondary pathogen. Dr. Holler thought there should have been
_Pasteurella_ present and considered it may have been the primary pathogen,
and for one reason or another was unculturable (successfully fought off by
the animal, which died before sampling).
Discussions with other bighorn biologists indicate _Pasteurella_ is often
very difficult to successfully retrieve from samples. There seems to be
some thought that the _Pasteurella_ had already run its course and was no
longer present, and the symptomatic sheep were survivors that were fighting
secondary infections. We have noted mortality across all age classes and
sexes. Current estimates are that mortality has approached 75 percent. Rams
have dispersed, and a full assessment of mortality, especially of mature
rams, won't be possible until the rut next fall.
