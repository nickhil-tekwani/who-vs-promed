Montana: Fourth Case of Hantavirus Infection in Month of May
------------------------------------------------
A Toole County man was diagnosed late Thu 27 May 2003 with hantavirus
infection, but he had already been discharged from hospital and is
recovering, health officials said on Friday. The man, in his 30s, was
hospitalized for several days and was on his way to recovery when
officials diagnosed his ailment as hantavirus infection, said Ken
Pekoc, a spokesman for the Department of Public Health and Human
Services. Health officials said the man had a history of exposure to
rodents in the Shelby and Cut Bank areas.
This hantavirus case is Montana's fourth in the past month and the
first ever in Toole County, health officials said. It is the 21st
case of the disease in Montana since it first appeared in the state
in 1993. 5 Montanans have died from the disease, including a
27-year-old man from Lewis and Clark County who died last week in
Helena. A 26-year-old Cascade County woman died of hantavirus on 8
May 2003, and a Dillon man in his 60s tested positive for the virus a
week later. He was released from a Dillon hospital and was expected
to recover.
Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is a severe respiratory infection
spread by rodent urine, feces, or saliva. People typically become
sick about 2 weeks after breathing airborne virus particles that are
stirred up in a rodent-infested space. No cure for the disease has
been developed, but it is treated by putting the patient on a
respiration device in a hospital. It is not considered contagious
from person to person in the United States, according to the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention. "One thing we would like to
emphasize to the health-care community, if someone is ill and the
symptoms are consistent with hantavirus infection, there is a very
simple diagnostic blood test that can be done at the state public
health lab," he said.
Health officials have said most cases of the virus come from
prolonged exposure to rodents in a home or workplace. They have said
the best way to prevent the disease is to make sure to keep mice out
of your house and to take precautions when cleaning out places that
might have harbored mice, such as old barns or sheds.
