Around 40 buffaloes have died within 4 days due to suspected Sahana disease (hemorrhagic septicemia) in a number of villages located in the Garadapur block of Odisha's Kendrapara.

"The disease is currently confined to 5 villages under the Garadapur block [map at https://tinyurl.com/wrfv34u]," Prasanna Kumar Patnaik, the chief district veterinary officer of Kendrapada, said.

"The people of the affected villages have been instructed to keep away from the dead animals and inform officials. If they must handle the carcasses, they should cover their hands with gloves. They have also [been] told to bury the dead animals in deep holes to prevent the spread of the disease," he added.

The villages include Bantala, Tarada, Purunagopinathpur, and Bhagabarpur.

Hemorrhagic septicemia is a severe bacterial disease caused by certain strains. The disease is also spread through contact with infected animals, contaminated clothing, equipment, and through ingestion or inhalation of the bacteria, Patnaik said.

Primary symptoms include swishing tails, reduced cudding, undigested food in faeces and reduced milk yield, he added.

"We sent blood samples of 12 affected buffaloes to the Animal Disease Research Institute (ADRI) in Cuttack to know the exact disease. A team from ADRI also rushed to the affected villages to examine the buffaloes on 23 Jan 2020," Patnaik said. However, locals said the response of the government has been tardy.

"The officials did nothing to curb the disease that was 1st detected in the 1st week of January 2020. It was only after it spread to more villages that they finally began to plan prevention measures," Dibakar Sandha of Tarada village, who lost 2 buffaloes on 21 Jan 2020, said.

Many locals used to earn their livelihoods by selling milk, cheese, and curd in the villages and nearby towns. They are now worried about their future.

"I used to earn around Rs 10 000 [USD 140.20] per month by selling milk from my 2 buffaloes. On 22 Jan 2020, they died," Samir Das of Tarada village, said.

[Hemorrhagic septicemia (HS), an OIE-listed disease, is a highly fatal bacterial disease seen mainly in cattle and water buffalo. HS results from infection by _Pasteurella multocida_ subsp. _multocida_; only 2 serotypes of this organism classically cause HS. In susceptible animals, the clinical signs often progress rapidly from dullness and fever to death within hours. Because the disease develops so quickly, few animals can be treated in time, and recovery is rare. Subclinical carriers can introduce hemorrhagic septicemia into a herd. Young animals are mainly affected in endemic regions, and outbreaks are particularly common during rainy weather, when the organism can spread readily. In areas where cattle have no immunity, severe disease is expected to occur in all ages.

HS is endemic in India. The most recent data pertain to 2018 (2019 report yet to be submitted). In 2018, HS wad reported from Odisha in February, affecting a herd of 216 susceptible water buffaloes, of which 182 got sick, of which 78 died.

This disease can be eradicated with quarantines, movement controls, tracing of contacts, euthanasia of infected and exposed animals, and cleaning and disinfection of the premises. In endemic areas, HS is mainly prevented by vaccination. The 2 HS serotypes of _Pasteurella_ do not infect humans.
