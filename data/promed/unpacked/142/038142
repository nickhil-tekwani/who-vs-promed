Highly pathogenic influenza A viruses (infection with) (non-poultry including wild birds), France
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Information received on Wed 2 Dec 2020 from Dr. Loic Evain, Directeur General adjoint, CVO, Direction generale de l'alimentation, Ministere de l'Agriculture et de l'Alimentation, Paris, France

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 23 Nov 2020
Date of confirmation of the event: 27 Nov 2020
Report date: 1 Dec 2020
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence of a listed disease
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza [HPAI] A virus
Serotype: H5
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced), necropsy
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Riantec, Morbihan
Date of start of the outbreak: 23 Nov 2020
Outbreak status: resolved 23 Nov 2020
Epidemiological unit: not applicable
Total animals affected
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Brent Goose: _Branta bernicla_ (Anatidae) / - / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0

Affected population: A Brent goose (_Branta bernicla_) was found dead following passive surveillance in wildlife carried out by the SAGIR network (French Biodiversity Office and National Hunters' Federation). The municipality is located in a wetland area considered as being at particular risk with regard to avian influenza linked to migration corridors.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Brent Goose: _Branta bernicla_ (Anatidae)/ ** / ** / 100 / **
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter
**Not calculated because of missing information

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: animal in transit, contact with wild species

Epidemiological comments: The first-line diagnosis limited to the M protein was confirmed by the national reference laboratory by a rapid, unofficial method and then by a sequencing method. Neuraminidase could not be identified due to the low viral load. Sequencing analyses carried out by the national reference laboratory on [1 Dec 2020] show that the virus is closely related to the sequences of the highly pathogenic H5 clade 2.3.4.4b viruses circulating in recent weeks in Russia, Northern Europe and France.

Control measures
Measures applied: surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; zoning; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Anses - Ploufragan-Plouzanet-Niort Laboratory, Ploufragan site (National laboratory) / Brent Goose / gene sequencing / 1 Dec 2020 / positive
Anses - Ploufragan-Plouzanet-Niort Laboratory, Ploufragan site (National laboratory) / Brent Goose / real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 27 Nov 2020 / positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[Given the presence HPAI H5N8 in the region, there is a high likelihood that these recent outbreaks reported by France and Ukraine are also associated with this same subtype.

"In Europe, the 1st outbreaks of HPAI H5N8 were reported in August 2020 in Russia in both poultry and wild birds. Since then, a new wave of outbreaks of H5N8 have been continuously reported in several of the European countries especially in wild birds but also in poultry starting from mid-October. The H5N8 virus has also reassorted with other wild bird influenza viruses to form new strains of H5N5 and H5N1 HPAI virus, which were also reported by countries. A few Asian countries also reported HPAI H5N8 outbreaks in poultry and/or wild birds. It is more likely that the source of introduction in these outbreaks is through migratory wild birds and onward local spread. Report of increased number of outbreaks in wild birds indicate periods of heightened risk in countries due to migratory flyways during this season. Consequently, improving on-farm biosecurity measures is a priority to reduce the likelihood of exposure to poultry".
