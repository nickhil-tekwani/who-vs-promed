-------------------------------------
Key points
----------
Table 1: Summary of current week (8), cumulative from epiweeks 1-8, 2020 and comparison with previous year (2019).
Current week (7) [10-16 Feb 2020] / Cumulative weeks 1-7 / Cumulative 2019 weeks 1-7
Suspected cases: 456 / 2633 / 1249
Confirmed cases: 102 / 689/ 381
Probable cases: 0 / 9 / 15
Deaths: 13 / 118 / 83
Case fatality rate (CFR): 12.7 % / 17.1 % / 21.8 %
Number of states affected: 18 / 27 / 21
Local government areas (LGAs) affected: 46 / 115 / 66

Highlights
- In week 08, the number of new confirmed cases decreased from 115 cases in week 07, 2020 to 102 cases. These were reported from 18 States (Ondo, Ebonyi, Edo, Bauchi, Plateau, Benue, Lagos, Enugu, Gombe, Kaduna, Katsina, Kogi, Sokoto, Taraba, Delta, Rivers, Adamawa, and Nasarawa) (Table 3).
- Cumulatively from week 1 to week 08, 2020, 118 deaths have been reported with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 17.1%, which is lower than the CFR for the same period in 2019 (21.8%).
- In total for 2020, 27 states have recorded at least one confirmed case across 115 Local Government Areas (Figure 2 and 3).
- Of all confirmed cases, 72% are from Edo (34%), Ondo (32%) and Ebonyi (7%) states.
- The predominant age-group affected is 21-30 years (Range: under one to 78 years, Median Age: 33 years). The male to female ratio for confirmed cases is 1:1.2 (Figure 4).
- The number of suspected cases has significantly increased compared to that reported for the same period in 2019.
- 4 new Health Care Workers were affected in Edo and Ondo states in the reporting week 08.

Response activities
- The National Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) has been activated to coordinate response activities across states. Of the states with confirmed cases, 8 of them have activated state- level EOCs
- National Rapid Response Teams have been deployed from NCDC to support response activities in 9 states.
- State Public Health Emergency Operations Centre activated in affected States.
- The 5 molecular laboratories for Lassa fever testing in the NCDC network are working full capacity to ensure that all samples are tested and results provided within the shortest turnaround time.
- NCDC is working to support every state in Nigeria to identify one treatment centre, while supporting existing ones with care, treatment and IPC commodities.
- Risk communications and community engagement activities have been scaled up across states using television, radio, print, social media and other strategies

Notes on this report
--------------------
Data source
-----------
Information for this disease was case based data retrieved from the National Lassa fever Emergency Operations Centre.

Case definitions
----------------
- Suspected case: any individual presenting with one or more of the following: malaise, fever, headache, sore throat, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, myalgia, chest pain, hearing loss, and has either a) history of contact with excreta or urine of rodents or b) history of contact with a probable or confirmed Lassa fever case within a period of 21 days of onset of symptoms. OR Any person with inexplicable bleeding/hemorrhagia.
- Confirmed case: any suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody, PCR or virus isolation).
- Probable case: any suspected case (see definition above) who died or absconded without collection of specimen for laboratory testing.
- Contact: anyone who has been exposed to an infected person, or to an infected person's secretions, excretions, or tissues within 3 weeks of last contact with a confirmed or probable case of Lassa fever.

*Healthcare worker (HCW) infections may not necessarily be of nosocomial origin; proposed study to differentiate nosocomial healthcare worker infection from community infection.

Calculations
------------
- Case fatality rate (CFR) for this disease is reported for confirmed cases only.

[The 102 new confirmed and 456 new suspected cases in week 8 (17-23 Feb 2020) indicate that Lassa fever (LF) virus transmission is continuing at a relatively high level, although declining somewhat. There are now 118 deaths among confirmed cases so far this year (2020). There are 4 new infected healthcare workers during the current week (week 8).

The report above confirms that Ondo and Edo states have the majority of cases. The area affected continues to grow. There are now 27 states and 115 local government areas with at least one case. Nigeria is now well into the period of the year when more cases usually occur, as illustrated in the graph in Figure 6 (available at the source URL above). There has been a peak in case numbers between weeks 1 and 11 (January-March) over the past 3 years, and it appears that this will be the case again this year (2020).

Transmission of LF virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir host excreta or are within healthcare facilities. It is encouraging to learn that risk communications and community engagement activities have been scaled up across states using television, radio, print, social media, and other strategies for avoidance of contact with rodent virus reservoirs and their excreta.
