A novel virus that can be transmitted by tick bites has been discovered in Japan. Dubbed Yezo virus (YEZV), it can cause fever and other symptoms in humans.

A case of the mysterious disease was recorded in 2019 after a 41-year-old man was admitted to a hospital with symptoms, including fever and leg pain, Hokkaido University noted in a news release. The man was bitten by an "arthropod believed to be a tick", but tests revealed he was not infected with any of the known viruses carried by ticks in the region.

Although the man was discharged from the hospital after 2 weeks, another case of the disease was reported a year later [in 2020], with the patient displaying similar symptoms.

Novel orthonairovirus
---------------------
In a study [reference below] published in the journal Nature Communications, a team of researchers identified the new orthonairovirus likely behind the illnesses through genetic analysis of the blood samples collected from the 2 patients. They also tested blood samples of 248 patients suspected of having a tick-borne disease and found that, in total, there were actually 7 cases from 2014 to 2020.

"YEZV is phylogenetically grouped with Sulina virus detected in _Ixodes ricinus_ ticks in Romania," the researchers wrote. The name of the novel virus is a reference to the historical Japanese name of Hokkaido, the place where the disease was discovered.

To determine the natural reservoir of the virus in Hokkaido, the team screened serum samples that were collected from wild animals in Hokkaido from 2010 to 2020. They found antibodies to YEZV in Hokkaido shika deer [sic: Sika deer, _Cervus nippon_] and raccoons [_Procyon lotor_), and the YEZV RNA in "3 major tick species" collected from 2016 to 2020.

"We demonstrated that at least 7 patients were infected with YEZV since 2014, and that wild animals and ticks may be potential reservoirs for the virus, suggesting that YEZV infection is endemic in this area," the researchers wrote.

Investigations beyond Hokkaido
------------------------------
While some of the patients showed rather serious features such as "abnormal liver function", no confirmed deaths have been linked to the new disease so far. The researchers said it is important to investigate its spread beyond Hokkaido, where the virus appears to have already been established.

"All of the cases of Yezo virus infection we know of so far did not turn into fatalities, but it's very likely that the disease is found beyond Hokkaido, so we need to urgently investigate its spread," Keita Matsuno, study co-author and virologist at Hokkaido University's International Institute for Zoonosis Control, said in the news release. "Furthermore, because the epidemiology and pathogenicity of Tamdy and Sulina group viruses are not yet fully elucidated, these emerging viruses in Asian countries could represent a larger burden on public health than currently recognized," the researchers wrote. "Comprehensive understanding of orthonairoviruses is highly desired to develop prophylaxes and therapeutics."

This is the second report of a tickborne orthonairovirus human infection in Japan and the first report originally published in English. The initial report was in Japanese and translated into English (see ProMED. Yezo virus - Japan: (HK) new virus, research 20200201.6937053). It describes the clinical course of the disease and it is similar to the disease of the patient described in the reference above.

The report above is drawn from the 20 Sep 2021 published report [citation above] that describes the case, identification of the virus, and its genetic analysis. One hopes that additional studies will define the geographic range of the virus in Japan and beyond; identify additional human cases or serological evidence of infection; and determine wild and domestic animal host range, reservoir status, and tick virus vector capacity. - Mod.TY
