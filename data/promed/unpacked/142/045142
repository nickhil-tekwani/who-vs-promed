Pneumonia claims 17 more bighorn sheep
--------------------------------------
JACKSON, Wyo. - Wyoming Game and Fish Department officials are considering
a reduction in bighorn sheep hunting licenses this fall due to a pneumonia
outbreak affecting the Gros Ventre herd.Twenty-nine dead sheep have been
found on the National Elk Refuge and in nearby areas, up from 12 at the end
of January, according to department spokesman Mark Gocke. The herd has
about 500 sheep.
"We're going to have to back off on licenses," Gocke said. "That 29 is just
what we've found. There will be more that have died." Twenty-eight hunting
licenses were issued for the herd last year. The number may be reduced to
20 this year. The department plans to hold public meetings this month and
next month to discuss the proposal.
Terry Kreeger, supervisor for the veterinary services branch of the Game
and Fish Department, said pneumonia is to blame for all the deaths but what
is causing the pneumonia remains a mystery. "We don't know if we will ever
find the cause," he said. Pasteurella pneumonia is often the cause of
wildlife deaths, he said, but that has not been found in overwhelming
numbers of dead sheep. Kreeger said the outbreak will probably end on its
own and animals with stronger immune systems will ward off the illness. "It
sounds bad, but the sooner they die the better in some instances," he said.
The disease does not spread from dead sheep.
