35 children have died of an unknown disease in Kalikot district over the
last 2 months, according to the Kalikot District Public Health Office (DPHO).
Local leading media group's website THT Online reported on Monday [25 Jun
2007] that in Khin of Kalikot district, some 380 km north west of the
capital Kathmandu, the children developed a cough at first, followed by
fever, chest pain, and finally died after profuse discharge of blood, Katak
Mahat, a health worker at the DPHO said. A mobile health team was sent to
the region to bring the disease, which has gripped over 1000 children
there, under control, he added.
Katak, who returned from the affected area to the district headquarters in
connection with controlling the epidemic, said although the epidemic was
not brought under full control, the situation was not so serious. Some
health personnel have stayed behind, and medicines were left there to
control the epidemic, he added.
Local newspaper The Kathmandu reported the same case last week, as 30 kids
in Khin of Kalikot district died of a diarrhea epidemic between [16 May
2007] and [21 Jun 2007]. Most of the dead belong to dalit communities,
belonging to lower castes. The outbreak has also spread into the
neighboring villages.

[According to the World Bank Development Indicators for Nepal, in 2005, the
reported infant mortality rate (IMR) was 56 per 1000 live births, and the
crude reported mortality rate (CMR) in children under 5 years of age was 74
per 1000 (see
<http://devdata.worldbank.org/external/CPProfile.asp?PTYPE=CP&CCODE=NPL>).
The information provided above suggests there is a respiratory disease
outbreak with an associated case fatality rate (CFR) of about 3.5 per cent.
While this CFR is lower than that of some serious infections [say, invasive
meningococcal infection. - Mod.SH], if one "assumes" that the affected
population is the under 5 year old population, then, if the associated
mortality of the above described outbreak is 35 per 1000, it represents
about 50 per cent of the child mortalities expected for the year, given the
background child mortality rates. More information about this outbreak and
its possible etiology would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
