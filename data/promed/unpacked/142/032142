There is little that can introduce or reintroduce a infectious disease back to a country than the chaos that surrounds war and political and social instability. We see numerous examples of this today to include diphtheria, measles, and malaria reappearance in socialist Venezuela or the humanitarian crisis that continues in South Sudan. However, no country is facing more serious problems than the poorest country in the Middle East -- Yemen.

Besides the starvation and destruction brought on by years of war and a current blockade, cholera has become nearly synonymous with Yemen with well over 900 000 cases reported since April [2017].

Now returning to Yemen for the 1st time since 2012 is the deadly vaccine preventable disease, diphtheria. And it's back with a force. According to a Sputnik-Mundo report (computer translated), World Health Organization (WHO) spokesman Christian Lindmeier said that Yemen has seen more than 100 cases of diphtheria since the beginning of the month [November 2017].

"By [8 Nov 2017] in Yemen were recorded 118 cases in which diphtheria was suspected and 11 deaths from that disease in 10 provinces. It is an endemic disease for Yemen, but the current outbreak is differentiated by a high level of mortality and its widespread spread," he said. The WHO representative denied that there was a direct relationship between the epidemic and the blockade of the country, but said the outbreak is due to the general situation in Yemen. Lindmeier stressed that his organization plans to start a vaccination campaign in that country on [18 Nov 2017], but to carry it out it is essential to suspend existing restrictions.

[Diphtheria is a vaccine-preventable disease. Diphtheria toxoid vaccine is not manufactured as a monovalent vaccine; it is available combined with tetanus toxoid, both in full-strength doses (denoted by upper case letters "DT") in pediatric formulations and in reduced-strength dose combined with full-strength dose of tetanus toxoid (denoted by upper case T and lower case d, "Td") in adult formulations. These are combined with acellular or whole-cell pertussis antigens in full strength in pediatric formulations (DTaP, DTwP) or in reduced strength in the adolescent/adult-formulations (Tdap).

In the United States, a total of 5 DTaP doses are recommended to be given to children, one dose each at ages 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, with booster doses at ages 15-18 months, and 4-6 years (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/downloads/child/0-18yrs-child-combined-schedule.pdf). The fully immunized person who is exposed can become a carrier of the bacterium but may only develop a mild case, or may not get sick at all. But if not fully vaccinated, the risk of getting severely ill is 30 times higher (http://www.vaccinews.net/diseases_vaccines.php).

Many of the complications of diphtheria, such as myocarditis and polyneuropathy, are due to toxin production. Respiratory difficulties can result from paralysis of the diaphragm and obstruction of the airways due the membrane that forms on the pharynx, tonsils, and soft palate that may extend to the larynx and trachea. Without treatment, as many as 1 out of 2 patients can die from the disease. Survival requires access to antibiotics, anti-toxin, and intensive medical care, which may not be available in war-torn regions. - Mod.ML
