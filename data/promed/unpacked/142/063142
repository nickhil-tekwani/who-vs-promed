From: Dr. Steve Berger <mberger@post.tau.ac.il>

I went back to the primary sources for the GIDEON note - the figures are
largely
derived from Kour_ G, et al (1998) Reemergence of Dengue in Cuba: A 1997
Epidemic in Santiago de Cuba, Emerging Infectious Diseases (Electronic
version)
4: 1-6.
Dr. German noted:
> <> 1977-1980 - Mod.JW. >>
In fact, the EID paper states that "Cuba had its first dengue epidemic of
modern
times in 1977; transmission continued probably until 1981...more than 500,000
mild cases were reported.
<>
The 158 fatalities did indeed occur during the 1981 epidemic, and not the
1977 to
1981 epidemic. This overlap is obviously confusing; however, GIDEON is merely
quoting the primary source (this will be reworded in the software).
> <<10,312 cases of DHF (158 fatal) were reported during 1981 to 1996...">>
GIDEON reports summary data for entire time periods (this is less tedious than
stating "0 in 1982; 0 in 1983; 0 in 1984; 0 in 1985.....0 in 1996"). The note
will be expanded as recommended to reflect specific data for 1981.
<1996. The Santiago epidemic had actually 3,012 cases which were reported
from January to October 1997.>>
The GIDEON note referring to cases reported during January to July is
accurate as
stated (2,946 cases). The subsequent revision to 3,012 was published ex post
facto.
Thank you for your comments and updates.
