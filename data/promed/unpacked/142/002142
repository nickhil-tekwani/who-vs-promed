A growing number of children are worryingly being brought in to clinics and hospitals across the city with symptoms -- high fever and full-body rash -- of a mystery illness. The problem is that these symptoms are not associated with any single type of illness, foxing doctors and diagnosticians.

Paediatricians are unsure whether the illness is dengue fever, scrub typhus or just a run-of-the-mill viral infection. A few classify it as viral exanthema, which has been endemic in the city this season, and has become the most common reason for children missing school.

Dr Preeti Galagali, a senior paediatrician, says, "There have been many cases, and out of 30 to 40 cases every day, at least 10 children have presented with these symptoms. These symptoms could signal dengue, viral infections or scrub typhus. I have seen children who are as young as 4 months old present with these symptoms, and the toughest thing about this is prevention, as many times the fever may be transmitted from family members. The only advice we can give is to stay away from school and ask patients to build their immunity and to eat fruit. In many cases children lose their appetite and many also become nauseous; due to this their blood pressure dips and they may eventually develop hypotension and shock."

The biggest threat is, however, when parents come in late for an examination, as by that time the blood count has already deteriorated. If it is detected early, the condition can be managed through symptomatic treatment.

Dr Girish S V, consultant neonatologist, Cloudnine Hospital, says, "These rashes are seen in children in between the age of 15 months and 2 years. Another age group affected is school-going children. The rashes have been seen in almost 20 per cent of the paediatric population. The classic pattern of viral fever this season is that it peaks in 3 days and then subsides. It may recur and the rashes appear during the convalescence."

The rashes are seen usually in the ears, nose, hands, feet and buttocks. Dr Chetan Ginigeri Consultant Pediatric Intensivist, People Tree Hospitals, says, "We have seen cases that have 40 per cent similarity with scrub typhus. When we test them it may not be positive but on clinical examination it indicates all the symptoms. When we treat them for scrub typhus, they recover."

There are 2 types of tests that detect scrub typhus: One is the Weil-Felix test, which diagnoses rickettsial infections; another is the _Rickettesia_ IgM [antibody] test, which is not available in most laboratories here.

Dr Ginigeri says, "The Weil-Felix test is not the most accurate test, as it shows only 40-50 per cent positivity, even though it may be 100 per cent positive. Going by the numerous test results, we have seen 3 positive cases recently."

Symptoms: Fever; Rashes near nose, ears, etc after 3 days; Sore throat following the rashes.

Scrub Typhus is prevalent mostly in rural areas because of the proximity to mites. Dr Asha Benakappa, paediatrician at Vani Vilas Hospital, said, "This season we have seen a large number of cases of viral exanthematous fever, which is mainly classified as fever with rashes. Out of 525 cases of viral infection we have seen 5 positive [positive for what?] cases but have not seen any deaths."

What is a viral exanthema? This is an eruptive skin rash, which is associated with fever or other symptoms and is most common in children. It may [be] because of infectious pathogens, unhygienic environment and in a few cases allergy to medication. This season there has been an outbreak of the epidemic among children.

[The illness described in the news report above is compatible with a diagnosis of scrub typhus. However, the news report above fails to mention in the description of the clinical picture the presence of an eschar, a black lesion at the site of the chigger bite, that is often a useful diagnostic clue. More information on this outbreak from knowledgeable sources would be greatly appreciated.

Outbreaks of scrub typhus have previously been reported from South India (http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12098-012-0721-0). Because scrub typhus can present in a non-specific manner, its diagnosis can be difficult and sensitive, and specific diagnostic tests may not be widely available.

Scrub typhus is caused by the rickettsia-like bacterium _Orientia tsutsugamushi_ that is transmitted by the bite of a chigger mite present in shrubberies. Symptoms develop 6 to 21 days after the chigger bite. Fever, headache, lymphadenopathy, and myalgias are common. A characteristic black eschar that is useful for making the diagnosis may be seen at the site of a chigger bite and a maculopapular rash may also be present. A picture of the eschar can be found at http://medind.nic.in/icb/t10/i8/icbt10i8p918.pdf.

Pneumonitis, meningoencephalitis, jaundice, renal failure, and myocarditis can develop if treatment is delayed. Because death rates for untreated scrub typhus patients are 1-30 per cent, treatment with doxycycline should begin immediately upon suspicion of scrub typhus without awaiting laboratory confirmation (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/content/12/2/pdfs/v12-n2.pdf). Treatment with azithromycin has been found to be equally effective (http://aac.asm.org/content/51/9/3259.full, http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/39/9/1329.full, and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3957884/).

The Weil-Felix test is an agglutination test based on the detection of antibodies to various _Proteus_ species, which contain antigens that cross-react with rickettsial antigens. The Weil-Felix test continues to be used for the diagnosis of scrub typhus in resource-poor regions, but it has poor sensitivity and specificity (http://www.japi.org/august2006/O-619.pdf). The gold standard for the diagnosis of scrub typhus has been the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay to detect _O. tsutsugamushi_-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies, but the fluorescence microscopes that are required for performance of this assay are often not available in resource-poor settings where scrub typhus is endemic.

In one study of an outbreak of scrub typhus in South India (1), 67 children were diagnosed using an IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which was said to be 91 percent sensitive and 100 percent specific. The children's ages ranged from 2 months to 11 years. Almost 60 percent resided in urban areas. Fever, edema of the face and extremities (due to a capillary leak syndrome), cough, vomiting, altered sensorium, anemia, low platelet count, and elevated liver enzymes were common. Almost 50 percent had an eschar at the site of the chigger bite. A rash (papular, petechial or erythematous) was seen on over 35 percent of patients; shock, in 45 percent; and respiratory failure, in 34 percent. Doxycycline was used for treatment in 46 children and azithromycin to 17 children. Of the 67 children, 8 children died with case fatality rate of 12 percent. Fatal cases were presented with refractory shock (100 percent), multiorgan failure (62 percent), acute renal failure (50 percent), acute respiratory failure (37 percent), or disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (12.5 percent).

Bangalore, with a population of about 8.42 million is the capital of the Indian state of Karnataka and is located in southern India inland on the Deccan Plateau, at a height of over 900 m (3000 ft) above sea level (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore). Karnataka is located along the Arabian Sea to the west and the Indian states of Maharashtra to the north and Kerala to the south.
