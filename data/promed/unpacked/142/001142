[The use of the term "birds" for species is a general one; specifying the avian species involved (such as, chickens, turkeys, ducks, quails, pigeons, etc.) would be helpful. The report includes an interactive map, showing the location of the outbreaks.

Since the 1st OIE notification, on 4 Apr 2013, a total of 27 cases from 8 locations have been tested; 20 536 birds have been destroyed (in a single location). A summary report of all, with map, is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000013249_20130410_171644.pdf.- Mod. AS].

Currently no positive samples of H7N9 found in pigs: WHO
--------------------------------------------------------
No positive samples of the H7N9 virus have been found in pigs or farms in China so far, the World Health Organization (WHO)
announced on Tuesday [9 Apr 2013].

WHO spokesperson Gregory Hartl said animal samples that tested positive were from poultry markets, including live bird markets. "So the focus at this point is on poultry markets," said Hartl.

However, Hartl told reporters that for the moment, "we don't have 100 percent surety on what the source of infection is. That might not be the correct source or the only source."

He added close contacts of confirmed cases of the deadly disease had been closely monitored with none so far testing positive for H7N9. "At this point, there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission," he said, adding that there are some "suspected but not yet confirmed cases of perhaps very limited transmission between close family members." "They are still being investigated," he said.

H7N9 found in more poultry samples in China
-------------------------------------------
China's agriculture authority said on Wed [10 Apr 2013] that its tests have found 14 more H7N9-positive poultry samples in east China.

The avian flu virus, so far responsible for the deaths of 9 people nationwide, was detected in 11 chicken samples from Jiangsu, 2 duck samples from Zhejiang, and one duck sample from Anhui Province, the Ministry of Agriculture said in a statement.

All of the samples were collected from poultry markets in those regions.

After gene sequence analysis, the national avian flu reference laboratory concluded that the strain of the H7N9 virus found on those 14 samples was highly congeneric with that found on a pigeon on 4 Apr 2013.

The ministry has ordered the 3 provinces to shut down the marketplaces from which the samples were taken and cull all live poultry there. Thorough disinfection is obligatory.

[4] News report
Date: Wed 10 Apr 2013

China's avian flu outbreak that has killed 9 people since March [2013] is being driven by at least 2 closely related viruses, a situation that may make it more difficult to contain in humans and birds, researchers said.

The H7N9 flu has shown signs of genetic diversity since the 1st 3 patients were diagnosed, said Richard Webby, director of a World Health Organization collaborating center for the virus at St Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis [Tennessee, USA]. It already appears more infectious than the H5N1 strain of bird flu that has been circulating since 2003, infecting 600 people and killing 60 percent of them, he said.

Scientists from around the world are working together to understand the virus because of the potential devastation caused by novel infections. The pandemics of the past century include the 1918 Spanish flu that killed as many as 50 million people and the 2003 SARS outbreak that killed 774.

"This virus might be getting more infectious to humans", Webby said in a telephone interview. "If this is let spread from where it is now, it will evolve further. That's what viruses do. If it isn't contained now, that will almost certainly happen".

Scientists tracking the H7N9 virus need more information about the ecosystems of birds in China, including those in live markets, feeder farms, and wild populations, to better understand and tackle the virus, said Maria Zambon, director of the UK's national influenza center. That will provide a clearer view of how easily H7N9 spreads and how best to control it.

[According to the latest information from Chinese sources, the number of confirmed human cases as of 10 Apr 2013 is 33, of which 9 died. These sources indicated that preliminary information from a Chinese Academy laboratory suggested that pigs did not play the role of intermediate host in the event (see, in Chinese, at http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2013-04-10/195926788335.shtml). Obtaining a definite picture from an OIE/WHO/FAO reference laboratory will be helpful.
