Ebola virus disease, West Africa - update 23 Jul 2014
-----------------------------------------------------
Between 18 and 20 Jul 2014, 45 new cases and 28 deaths [of Ebola virus disease (EVD)] were reported from Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. These include suspect, probable, and laboratory-confirmed cases. As of 20 Jul 2014, the cumulative number of cases attributed to EVD in the 3 countries stands at 1093, including 660 deaths.

Disease update
--------------
New cases and deaths attributable to EVD continue to be reported by the ministries of health in the 3 West African countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Between 18-20 Jul 2014, 45 new cases of EVD, including 28 new deaths, were reported from the 3 countries as follows:
- Guinea: 5 new cases and 4 deaths;
- Liberia: 28 new cases with 11 deaths;
- Sierra Leone: 12 new cases and 13 deaths.

These numbers include laboratory-confirmed, probable, and suspect cases and deaths of EVD.

The distribution and classification of the cases are as follows:
- Guinea, 415 cases (304 confirmed, 98 probable, and 13 suspected) and 314 deaths (204 confirmed, 98 probable, and 12 suspected);
- Liberia, 224 cases (77 confirmed, 68 probable, and 79 suspected) and 127 deaths (56 confirmed, 44 probable, and 27 suspected);
- Sierra Leone, 454 cases (405 confirmed, 35 probable, and 14 suspected) and 219 deaths (182 confirmed, 32 probable, and 5 suspected).

Health sector response
----------------------
The regional director, WHO African Region, began official visits to the 3 West African countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone on 21 Jul 2014. On the 1st leg of his mission, the regional director visited Liberia from 21-22 Jul 2014. The goal of the visit is to make a 1st-hand assessment of the EVD outbreak, review the current outbreak response and challenges, and explore the best ways to rapidly contain the EVD outbreak in West Africa.

The regional director held official meetings with the president of Liberia and the minister of health, including senior government officials. The president and the regional director also participated in the Ebola national coordination meeting at the Ministry of Health. During this meeting, the regional director emphasized the need to step up implementation of key outbreak containment strategies, including community engagement and involvement, effective contact tracing, cross-border collaboration and effective coordination.

Discussions were also held with international and local non-governmental organizations, UN agencies, and other stakeholders to enhance collaboration and effective coordination. The regional director called upon all partners to be fully involved in the EVD outbreak response. Following his visit to Liberia, significant financial contributions and commitments were made, including from the government and partners.

In Liberia, the minister of health launched the national strategic plan for accelerated response to the EVD outbreak. The plan is aligned to the inter-country strategy for accelerated response to the outbreak, adopted in the Accra ministerial meeting. It is expected that the launch and subsequent implementation of this strategic plan will bring tangible improvement and scale up effective outbreak containment measures at field level. Similarly, the Ministry of Health and partners in Guinea and Sierra Leone are conducting planning meetings to re-strategize and come up with concrete, action-oriented national operational plans to accelerate the response to the EVD outbreak response.

Efforts are currently ongoing to scale up and strengthen all aspects of the outbreak response in the 3 countries, including contact tracing, public information and community mobilization, case management and infection prevention and control, and coordination.

Sierra Leone: news analysis of state of fight against Ebola
-----------------------------------------------------------
A very important Sierra Leone citizen was this week quoted as saying "We have to ensure that within the next couple of weeks or so, we will put the whole issue of Ebola behind us." Clearly, this very important citizen is under a huge illusion based on gross misinformation he might have been given by those in whom he has placed trust. This very important citizen has shown, with those words, that he really has no idea of the extent of gravity of what is now unfolding inside Sierra Leone with respect to Ebola virus disease [EVD].

Family members of 2 prominent doctors in Kenema [3rd largest city in Sierra Leone] have confided to this newspaper that the doctors are currently stricken with EVD-like symptoms. One of them (name withheld) is said to be awaiting his test results whilst the other, Dr Sheik Umar Khan was last evening, 22 Jul 2014, announced by the Health Ministry, as being confirmed positive for EVD. Dr Khan is the specialist doctor in charge of the Ebola Unit in Kenema Government Hospital.

Simultaneously, a national broadcaster last evening [22 Jul 2014] reported that following the deaths of 8 nurses within one month, ostensibly from infection, the Kenema city Ebola Unit is now abandoned by nurses who accuse the Health Ministry of being "incapable" of protecting health workers. Kenema EVD patients lie abandoned in a manner similar to those who were left to their own devices in Kissi Teng, when this crisis first broke.

Dr Khan has last evening [22 Jul 2014] been moved to the Kailahun Ebola center built and operated by the international NGO [non governmental organisation], Medecins Sans Frontieres. There have been widespread ironical comments over the move of the infected medical doctor from Kenema to Kailahun. It could be recalled there were vehement protests against the move of EVD patients from the remote epicenter of Kissi Teng, Kailahun to Kenema, which is a metropolitan city. Those protests had been met with government's insistence that it was only in Kenema that EVD patients could be effectively treated.

The opponents of the Kailahun to Kenema move had firmly insisted that, by international protocol, health facilities in the remote epicenter should have been instantly upgraded; with field hospital services speedily created on the very day the outbreak happened.

Less than 2 months after [that], we will today, 23 Jul 2014, have recorded over 500 laboratory confirmed, suspected and probable EVD cases in just Sierra Leone. No-one knows actual number of deaths from EVD in Sierra Leone. [Officially reported to WHO as of 20 Jul 2014 in [1] above: 454 cases (405 confirmed, 35 probable, and 14 suspected) and 219 deaths -- have there been 50 more cases reported since then? - Mod.JW]

Meanwhile, another eerie similarity to Kissi Teng happened over weekend [19-20 Jul 2014] in Freetown, when irate relatives of a suspected EVD patient forcibly removed her from the PCMH Cottage Hospital [in Freetown] and took her home out of fear she would be "killed" [see ProMED-mail archive 20140722.2626215]. This brought memories of what happened between 26-27 May 2014 when Health Ministry said Kailahun's Kissi Teng residents forcibly removed suspected EVD patients from health facilities and took them home. Back then, reports were that Kailahun residents had feared their loved ones would be "killed" by health workers. In reaction, those Kailahun residents had been described by Health Minister as 'gullible' people. It will now appear Freetown also has "gullible" people.

Religious leaders have now urged for prayers against a still-unfolding plague.

Ebola [virus disease] outbreak update
-------------------------------------
As of today, 23 Jul 2014, we have 108 cumulative number of survivors, 427 confirmed Ebola virus disease [EVD] cases [including] 144 EVD confirmed deaths [estimated case fatality rate (CFR) 34 per cent]. 65 patients are currently admitted at the EVD treatment centers in Kenema and Kailahun.

The Ministry of Health and Sanitization and the World Health Organization have established a dedicated Ebola Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at the WHO Country Office in Freetown. The EOC is co-directed by the minister of health, Ms Miata Kargbo and the WHO representative for Sierra Leone, Dr Jacob Mufunda and consists of leaders and partners involved in our fight against EVD.

The EOC will serve as the Sierra Leone National Central Command and Control Center for Outbreak Response activities and meets every day. The EOC members under the leadership of the hon. minister of health and sanitation unanimously decided at the 22 Jul 2014 meeting that the following actions be effected immediately:

- That all new confirmed cases be admitted at the Treatment Center in Kailahun while the Ministry and its partners work on relocating the Treatment Center in Kenema out of the Kenema Government Hospital premise to another location as requested by health workers and the people of Kenema.
- The existing patients at the treatment center in Kenema continue to be cared for at that center with enhanced Infection Prevention Control and nursing care.
- More health personnel be trained in Infection Prevention Control and nursing care.
- Tulane University to stop ebolavirus testing during the current EVD outbreak.
- Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to officially send their findings and recommendations from the assessment of the laboratory and treatment center in Kenema.
- Ministry of Health and Sanitation to proceed with the procurement of 3 vehicles currently in country for contact tracing and surveillance.

The EOC wishes the general public and all partners working in the healthcare sector to know that Dr Shiekh Umar Khan is still alive and responding to treatment, contrary to social media report of his demise.

Liberia: Ebola strikes doctor at Phebe
--------------------------------------
A doctor at the Phebe Hospital in Bong County has been tested positive for the deadly Ebola virus disease [EVD], barely a month after a head doctor at the Redemption Hospital in the Borough of New Kru Town died of the disease at the John F Kennedy Memorial Hospital in Monrovia.

The doctor, whose name has not been disclosed was transferred to Monrovia along with 4 nurses, 3 of whom died yesterday [23 Jul 2014]. The doctor and nurses were said to have come in contact with an EVD patient from Lofa County, who had earlier told health workers at the hospital that she resides in Gbarnga, Bong County.

The doctor is being quarantined by health authorities for additional days to monitor his status. The latest incident from the Phebe Hospital has increased panic among health workers, with many of them expressing fear for their lives on the job. In Monrovia, several hospitals have shut their doors to the public, including Redemption Hospital and the James Davies Memorial Hospital in Nee-Zoe community, Paynesville after nurses and doctors refused to report for work.

Lack of PPE (personal protective equipment)
-------------------------------------------
Health workers [in Liberia] lack protective garments to handle suspected EVD patients, so much so that several nurses have contracted the virus while attending to patients and subsequently died of the disease. The government of Liberia has complained of lack of funds to equip health facilities across the country with protective garments for health workers.

[5] Liberia: protests

Man sets Liberia's Health Ministry ablaze
-----------------------------------------
What seemed an unprecedented form of protest against the Liberian government's handling of the deadly Ebola virus disease erupted on Wednesday [23 Jul 2014] when a Liberian man set the conference room at the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare in Congo Town on fire in the early afternoon. Workers at the ministry were constrained to use a ladder to burst open the glass windows of the conference room when they saw the smoke, which billowed out of the building, which saved the entire building, restricting the fire to only the conference room.

The Liberia Fire Service arrived after the health ministry employees had already put out the fire and made a citizen arrest of the culprit. The situation saw many employees running for their lives and it brought a halt to normal working activities at the Health Ministry. Reports gathered by FrontPageAfrica indicate that [the man] has been engaging the Health Ministry, informing them that his 14 year old relative died as a result of the deadly Ebola virus.

Eyewitnesses, some whom work at the ministry say the aggrieved Liberian who called the fire 'A miracle' said he wanted to set the entire building ablaze because he blames the lack of doctors and nurses at major government hospitals to cater to his sick relative as what led to the relative's death.

Health minister Dr Walter Gwenigale said "I came out I saw a group of people standing over a young man, whom they say confessed that he started the fire because a relative of his died of EVD and nobody paid attention to him, that's all I know," said Dr Gwenigale. "The offices are okay, it is the conference room here, where we can have the major conferences, that actually burned completely and is destroyed" [he said].

The man is the 1st Liberian to publicly protest the government's handling of the disease in this manner since the outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus disease, which has now caused 50 confirmed deaths and over 100 cases. The suspect was quickly arrested by health ministry employees and turned over to the Liberia National Police.

Protest from ELWA residents
---------------------------
As the fire raged in the conference room at the health ministry, a sizeable number of residents from Kpelleh Town and surrounding communities in the ELWA [Eternal Love Winning Africa] area blocked the main entrance of the ELWA compound housing the ELWA hospital to protest against the establishment of an EVD isolation center in the area. A resident expressed fear over the setting up of the EVD isolation center because they say it could lead to infecting people living in that area with the ebolavirus.

[From Sierra Leone comes the bad news that 2 more local doctors have been infected, including Dr Sheik Umar Khan who last evening, 22 Jul 2014, the Ministry of Health said had been confirmed positive for EVD. Dr Khan is the specialist doctor in charge of the Ebola Unit in Kenema Government Hospital. Hopefully, given the excellent clinical care of MSF, they will be among the survivors. The latest WHO figures in [1] above show that in Sierra Leone, half the EVD patients survive (according to Serra Leone's figures in [4] above, 2/3 survive). It would be good if Guinea could bring their 25 per cent survival rate up to at least that level.

The news media in Sierra Leone appear to understand the EVD situation very well, but there is obviously still a lot of misinformation among the public, even at high levels.

From Liberia, there is a disturbing report of a violent protest action.

2 things are urgently needed in the 3 EVD-infected countries:
- better communication with the public about the risk of infection, and
- more PPE (personal protective equipment).

There is absolutely NO NEED for health workers to continue dying from treating EVD patients. - Mod.JW]
