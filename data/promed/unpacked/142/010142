[Virus isolation is the gold standard for confirmation. If virus was not
isolated & these were confirmed by serology on a single blood specimen, we
would be interested to know the test used: Single IgM? Single IgG? Higher
serum titer to YF virus than to dengue? Perhaps someone in Brazil can tell
us. - Mod.CHC
