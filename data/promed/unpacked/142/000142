----------------------------------------------------
A novel filovirus has been detected in bats in the Iberian Peninsula. A
full length genome sequence has been obtained in a collaboration between
the Instituto de Salud Carlos III and the Center for Infection and Immunity
at Columbia University. Preliminary phylogenetic analysis indicates that
this virus is taxonomically distinct from ebolavirus and Lake Victoria
marburgvirus. There is no evidence that this virus has infected humans.

[ProMED-mail is indebted to Antonio Tenorio for providing the above
information clarifying the status of the filovirus isolated from bats in
the north of Spain.

Currently, the family _Filoviridae_ consists of 2 distinct genera
_Ebolavirus_ and _Marburgvirus_ (Virus Taxonomy, 8th Report of the ICTV,
Elsevier, 2005), embracing viruses predominately associated with outbreaks
of haemorrhagic disease in the African continent. It is likely that this
novel virus found in bats in the north of Spain, and as yet not associated
with disease in humans, may have to be ranked by the International
Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) as a novel genus in the family
_Filoviridae_. Further characterization of the properties and host range of
this novel bat virus is awaited with great interest by the virology community.
