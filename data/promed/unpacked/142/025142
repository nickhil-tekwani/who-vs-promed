The world may no longer be Sydney's oyster
------------------------------------------
Sydney's world-famous rock oysters, one of the high points of Australian
cuisine, are slowly starving to death. A mystery parasite is threatening to
wipe out the succulent delicacies, which are held in the same esteem by
Australian diners as abalone is at Asian tables and truffles by French and
Italian gourmets. Unique to the east coast of Australia, the Sydney rock
oysters are prized around the world for their exquisite taste, long shelf
life, and, some suggest, aphrodisiac properties.

The disease threatens to destroy an AUD 30 million (USD 23.1 million) a
year industry, taking with it the livelihoods of hundreds of oyster farmers
whose families have harvested the molluscs for generations. The disease has
hit so hard that a 3rd generation of oyster harvesters might be the last to
make their living from Sydney rock oysters, which take 4 years to reach
maturity and require meticulous farming. They must be tended daily. Unlike
other oysters, Sydney rock oysters can survive for up to 3 weeks out of
water and can be delivered alive to restaurants worldwide.

23 Hawkesbury oyster farms may go out of business after total losses of AUD
10 million (USD 7.7 million) since the parasite 1st attacked in 2004. Last
year [2004], the parasite was found in about 30 per cent of the Hawkesbury
oysters. Now almost all are affected. Illustrating the extent of the
disease, a harvester shucked open about 50 of his oysters before he found
one alive.

As well as being fast-moving, the QX parasite -- "Q" for Queensland state,
where it is thought to have originated, and "X" for unknown -- also has
close to a 100 per cent mortality rate. It kills by attacking the oysters'
gut and starving them. It spreads rapidly, but the oysters suffer a
lingering death.

So far, the QX disease has been unstoppable. It destroyed the industry in
southern Queensland in the 1970s and reappeared in the Georges River, which
cuts through southern Sydney, 10 years ago, wiping out farmers there. Now
it is devouring oysters in the Hawkesbury, the 2nd-largest producer behind
a system of rivers in northern New South Wales.

New South Wales Fisheries (NSW), the state agency responsible for the
industry, says the disease is caused by the parasite _Marteilia sydneyi_,
whose origin is uncertain and whose life cycle is thought to include an
unknown intermediate host. After the Georges River outbreak, NSW Fisheries
selectively bred what it believes are QX-resistant oysters from the few
that survived. These are now being put to the test in Hawkesbury.

The Sydney rock oyster industry is among Australia's oldest. Aborigines had
harvested the native oysters for centuries before the arrival of European
settlers, who began commercial oyster farming in the 1890s.

In the meantime, Hawkesbury farmers have asked the New South Wales
government to contract them to clean the river of dead oysters so as to
generate much-needed income. They say healthy oysters even play an
important role in river environments by keeping pollution levels down.
Having oysters in the river is like having a oil filter in your car. They
help improve the river's health.
