Anthrax confirmed in bison at Wood Buffalo National Park
--------------------------------------------------------
Hot, dry weather created prime conditions for an outbreak, official says

Parks Canada has confirmed that anthrax is to blame for the recent deaths of dozens of bison. 52 bison have died in the latest outbreak at the park. "The risk to humans is very, very low," said Stuart MacMillan with Parks Canada. "What we advise people to do is if they do see a carcass, don't approach it, report it to the Park office so that we know where it is." MacMillan says most of the bison have died in remote areas, which virtually eliminates the risk to humans.

Parks officials believe the worst is over, now that the weather has turned cooler. They say dry, hot weather earlier this summer [2015] allowed the anthrax spores to surface, creating prime conditions for an outbreak. "As conditions become a little bit less dry and hot over the course of the summer, as the summer proceeds and the days get a little bit shorter and perhaps we get some cooler weather, we already feel like we've passed the peak of the outbreak," MacMillan said.

"We'll continue to do surveillance to see if that's true."

[The statement "most of the bison have died in remote areas" indicates that the deaths are not all in one place but scattered. Parks Canada are very efficient in air surveillance during the summer for this disease in their wood bison. Using temperature sensing devices on their helicopters they can "see" dead bison hidden under the tree cover as the decomposing carcasses generate heat for 5 days. Burning the 52 carcasses is a challenge but they are very efficient with their hot-shot burning crews.

For a description of the park, go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood_Buffalo_National_Park. If you are ever in Alberta, I strongly recommend that you consider visiting this park. It is a singular experience. - Mod.MHJ]
