1st detection of Schmallenberg virus antibodies in the Republic of Serbia
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Since its emergence in 2011 Schmallenberg virus (SBV) has spilled over into new regions of Europe. At the beginning of 2013, SBV infection was confirmed in Hungary and Slovenia [see comment]. No clinical cases of SBV infection have been, so far, diagnosed in the Republic of Serbia.

Due to the epidemiological situation in the region, a serosurvey to SBV in dairy cattle has been carried out in the Republic of Serbia.

Blood samples were collected between 17 May and 3 Jun 2013 from cows kept in 8 barns located in the northern part of the country (119 cows in total; 4-30 cows in each barn). No cows have been introduced into these barns during at least the last 6 months. All animals had access to pastures and thus could have been exposed to vectors of SBV. The samples were serologically tested on 12 Jun 2013, using ID Screen Schmallenberg virus indirect (IDvet Innovative Diagnostics).

Seropositive cows were detected in 2 barns: 15 (all tested cows) in one barn and 1 cow in the other barn. There was also one barn with one doubtful result.

This is the 1st report of SBV infection from the Republic of Serbia.

[ProMED-mail is very grateful to Dr Kaba and his co-authors from Serbia, Germany, and Romania for the firsthand information above.

We are informed that the serological tests on Serbian cattle described above were performed in the Laboratory of Veterinary Epidemiology and Economics, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Warsaw University of Life Sciences-SGGW, Warsaw, Poland.

Suspected SBV infections were reported by ProMED-mail from Hungary and Slovenia in January 2013; confirmation or otherwise was requested in postings 20130106.1484643 and 20130126.1516151, respectively. No response from the said countries has become available so far; hence, the RFI is being hereby repeated. - Mod.AS

[2] UK (Scotland): clinical case, bovine

A virus spread by midges has been found in a calf born on a farm in Aberdeenshire. Schmallenberg virus (SBV) has been confirmed after the calf -- born to a homebred suckler heifer -- was found to be severely deformed. The disease, first identified on German and Dutch farms, is not thought to pose a risk to humans. A vaccine has been approved by government vets.

In April [2013], there was another confirmed case on a Dumfriesshire farm. Scotland's Rural College (SRUC) advised any farmers who encounter foetal abnormalities, stillbirths, or newborns showing signs of disease to contact their vet.

Last year [2012], a ram from Shropshire was also confirmed with the virus after being transported to Orkney.

According to the SBV page of the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut (FLI) in Germany, last updated 11 Jun 2013, "so far infections with Schmallenberg virus have been detected in the following (17) European countries: Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, UK and Northern Ireland, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Spain, Denmark, Estonia, Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Poland, Austria, and Switzerland. According to unconfirmed reports, there could be infections in additional European countries."

The Serbian Republic can now be added to the 17 countries above; information from other countries, and in particular from Hungary and Slovenia, is anticipated. - Mod.AS
