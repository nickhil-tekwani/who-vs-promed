At least 60 people have been affected by an outbreak of monkeypox in
the northern department of Likouala in the Republic of Congo, a
health official has said.
"We had registered 62 probable cases, which were confirmed through a
rapid laboratory test," Jean-Vivien Mombouli, the director of
research at the national public health laboratory (Laboratoire
national de sante publique), said on 24 Sep [2007]. According to
testimonies from the villagers, Mombouli said, there were at least
150 cases in the district. Most of those affected were refugees from
the Democratic Republic of the Congo younger than 15. "The clinical
signs confirmed the disease," he said.
Monkeypox is a rare viral disease found mostly in the rainforest
countries of central and West Africa, characterized by a high fever
accompanied by intense fatigue and [pox-like] lesions, Mombouli said.
"There is no treatment or vaccine for the disease," he said. "The
recovery is spontaneous." [In fact, smallpox vaccination protects
against infection, or failing that, mitigates the severity. -
Mod.JW] Infection follows physical contact with animals, especially
monkeys, during the preparation of meat, he said. According to
Mombouli, the virus had adapted to the human species. "If we neglect
the virus and let it evolve, it will become more virulent and lethal," he said.
The outbreak started in January [2007], with the last case being
registered at end-August [2007]. The disease was spread out over a
200km [124-mile] radius in Likouala and affected villages along the
River Oubangui. The river is a natural border between the Congo
Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the Central African
Republic [see map URL below].
Meanwhile, 4 experts from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, GA, are expected in Brazzaville this
week [24-28 Sep 2007] to analyse samples taken by Congolese health
experts in the affected areas in order to identify the origin of the
outbreak, which so far remains unknown.

[A recent review by Parker, Buller and Schultz (Future Microbiology
2: 17-34, Feb 2007) has identified monkeypox virus infection as an
emerging zoonotic disease. Zoonotic monkeypox virus is maintained in
a large number of rodent and, to a lesser extent, nonhuman primate
species in West and central Africa. Although monkeypox virus was
discovered in 1958, the prototypic human cases were not witnessed
until the early 1970s. Before this time, it is assumed that
infections were masked by smallpox, which was then widely endemic.
Nevertheless, since the 1970s, reported monkeypox virus infections of
humans have escalated, as have outbreaks with reported human-to-human
transmission. This increase is likely due to numerous factors, such
as enhanced surveillance efforts, environmental degradation and human
urbanization of areas where monkeypox virus is maintained in its
animal reservoir(s) and, consequently, serve as a nidus for human
infection. Furthermore, viral genetic predispositions enable
monkeypox virus to infect many animal species, represented in
expansive geographic ranges.
Monkeypox virus was once restricted to specific regions of Africa,
but its range has expanded, suggesting that human monkeypox
infections could continue to intensify. As a zoonotic agent,
monkeypox virus is far less sensitive to typical eradication measures
since it is maintained in wild-animal populations. Moreover, human
vaccination is becoming a less viable option to control poxvirus
infections in today's increasingly immunocompromised population,
particularly with the emergence of HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa. An
increased frequency of human monkeypox virus infections, especially
in immunocompromised individuals, may permit monkeypox virus to
evolve and maintain itself independently in human populations.
The apparent increased frequency of human monkeypox virus infections
in Africa may be a consequence of the increased prevalence of
immunocompromised individuals in the human population, promoting
maintenance of the virus in humans and possibly enhanced virulence. - Mod.CP]
[Although monkeypox virus has been isolated from monkeys and human
cases have been associated with contact with monkeys, the reservoirs
of the virus most likely are rodents. The giant pouched rat
(_Cricetomys_), rope squirrels (_Funisciuris_ sp.) and dormice
(_Graphiuris_ sp.) are suspected. All of these were incriminated in
the epidemic spread by exotic pets in the USA in 2003 -- see Hutson
et al. 2007 & ProMED refs. below. In that epidemic, spread was not
from meat but by the respiratory route and possibly from handling the
animals (hand-to-mouth contact). More field research is needed to
define the range of the virus and its relationship to its mammalian
reservoirs. There is just one documented instance of human-to-human
transmission.
