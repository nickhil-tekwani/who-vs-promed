Peru updated its official death toll from COVID-19 on Monday [31 May 2021], adding more than 110 000 fatalities than previously reported.

As the raging pandemic in Argentina prompted co-hosts of the Copa America soccer tournament to pull out, the decision was made to move the premier South American sports event to Brazil. Brazil, which has the 3rd-most COVID-19 cases in the world, is clearly not a risk-free setting to host the matches. But the local soccer league kicked off its season last weekend without fans in the stands, and Brazil has few, if any, restrictions to enter the country beyond a negative PCR test.

Chancellor Angela Merkel is ready to allow Germany's lockdown law to lapse, the latest sign that the pandemic is releasing its grip on Europe's largest economy. Germany passed mandatory restrictions in hard-hit areas, including curfews, in April [2021]. The powers were set to expire at the end of June [2021], and Merkel confirmed that those "can run out now", she said on Monday [31 May 2021] in Berlin.

The country has gradually been easing restrictions as infections fall and vaccinations accelerate. On Monday [31 May 2021], Germany had had 35.1 cases per 100 000 people over the past 7 days, the lowest level since mid-October [2020], and as of Sunday [30 May 2021], 43% of the population had received at least one vaccine dose. Meanwhile, Brussels has proposed lifting all quarantine rules starting 1 Jul 2021 for those who are fully vaccinated, the Guardian reports.

US hospital beds occupied by COVID-19 patients on 28 May 2021 held steady at the lowest rate since 14 Mar 2020, while the country reported the lowest level of infection since the early days of the pandemic. Hospital beds occupied by COVID-19 patients totaled 25 393. Two US disease experts said on Sunday [30 May 2021] that the world needs the cooperation of the Chinese government to trace the origins of COVID-19.

Argentina reported 28 175 new COVID-19 cases on Monday [31 May 2021], for a total of 3.8 million, according to the country's evening report. It reported 638 deaths in the past 24 hours, bringing the total to 78 093.

Brazil reported a confirmed 30 434 new COVID-19 cases in the past 24 hours, according to Health Ministry data. The country's coronavirus death toll rose by 860 in the past 24 hours to 462 791.

Starting on Tuesday [1 Jun 2021], the Guardian reports that a system will be in place to let European Union member states issue a digital COVID passport to citizens proving their status and allowing them to travel. A deadline will be set for 1 Jul 2021 for all 27 EU countries to accept the documentation as sufficient proof of vaccination. Also, the Guardian reported that scientists are urging the UK government to speed up 2nd doses of COVID vaccines and delay a decision on easing lockdown restrictions on 21 Jun 2021 in an effort to tackle the creeping spread of new cases.

[In Peru,] 180 764 people have died from coronavirus through 22 May 2021, according to a report by a group of experts convened by the government to clarify the real number of victims in the country of some 32 million people. That's 165% higher than the previous official tally of 68 053 and would place [Peru] 5th globally in total deaths after the USA, Brazil, India, and Mexico, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.

Denmark's government has asked the national health authority to review whether the country can resume use of AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine and include Johnson & Johnson (J&J) in its inoculation program, after initially judging they were too risky, health minister Magnus Heunicke tells state broadcaster DR. J&J was removed from the Danish vaccine program in May [2021] amid concerns it was linked to blood clots. Denmark suspended AstraZeneca's vaccine in April [2021].

Restaurants and cafes in Turkey, which have been effectively closed for weeks except for takeaway and delivery, in a partial easing of lockdown measures will be allowed to open in June [2021] from 7 am until 9 pm, except for Sundays, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after a Cabinet meeting on Monday [31 May 2021]. Gyms and parks will also reopen in June [2021].

Pfizer wants to include teenagers ages 12 and older in its COVID-19 vaccine package leaflet, Brazil's health regulator known as Anvisa said in a statement. Currently, the vaccine is authorized in Brazil for those 16 and older. Studies will be needed to demonstrate a safety and efficacy relationship for the age group, Anvisa says.

Myanmar will continue to push for COVID-19 vaccination after cases soared in the last week of May [2021], according to the Ministry of Health and Sports. The country is set to administer more than 800 000 doses of AstraZeneca and Sinopharm vaccines in 15 provinces.

The Philippines kept its capital under loose movement restrictions under which most businesses can operate in a limited capacity. Metro Manila and other nearby economic areas will remain under the 2nd-lowest level of curbs called "general community quarantine" until 30 Jun 2021, president Rodrigo Duterte said in a televised briefing on Monday [31 May 2021]. The surge in COVID-19 cases has subsided in the past weeks, prompting renewed calls from officials for reopening to aid an economy that remained in recession last quarter. Vaccinations have been picking up, with almost 5.2 million doses administered as of Sunday [30 May 2021].

The Thai government's main COVID-19 panel decided to delay a plan to ease restrictions on some businesses in the capital. That was only 6 hours after it was announced that Bangkok, the epicenter of Thailand's latest outbreak, would allow some venues including museums, nail salons, beauty clinics and massage parlors to resume operations from Tuesday [1 Jun 2021]. This means the establishments will remain closed until 14 Jun 2021. Thailand recorded 5485 new infections and 19 deaths on Monday [31 May 2021], taking the cumulative caseloads to 159 792 and 1031, respectively. The majority of new infections reported were still found in Bangkok.

Taiwan's outbreak has been easing based on recent data, while the situation remains challenging, president Tsai Ing-wen said in an online briefing. Tsai urged the public to avoid unnecessary outings and gatherings as its COVID-19 alert remains at the 3rd level.

Singapore will probably ease restrictions in mid-June [2021] as it gets a new outbreak driven by variants under control. Prime minister Lee Hsien Loong said that if the number of community cases falls further, authorities should be able to ease curbs that had been put in place for 4 weeks after 13 Jun 2021. As part of the strategy, school kids will be inoculated next month [June 2021], and every adult who wants a shot would have one by early August [2021]. "Barring another super-spreader or big cluster, we should be on track to bring this outbreak under control," Lee said in a national address. "We will know for sure in another week or so."

Germany is investigating reports of fraud by some of the country's 15 000 centers offering free coronavirus tests, according to health minister Jens Spahn. Some centers have been drastically inflating the number of tests carried out and cashing in on government funds, local media have reported, and Spahn said he will discuss the claims with counterparts from Germany's 16 states Monday morning [31 May 2021].

Australia's Victoria state recorded 6 new local COVID-19 infections on Monday [31 May 2021] in addition to the 5 reported earlier, taking active cases to at least 54. "I want to be very clear with everyone, this outbreak may well get worse before it gets better," acting state premier James Merlino told reporters in Melbourne. "In the past 24 hours we identified many more points of concern." The nation's 2nd-most populous state has been under stay-at-home orders since 27 May 2021 and will remain so until at least 3 Jun 2021, when officials will assess if the latest outbreak is under control.

The Japanese government is considering requiring spectators of the Tokyo Olympics to be either tested or vaccinated, the Yomiuri newspaper reported, citing officials who weren't identified. The government's draft plan calls for spectators to present proof of a negative result from a test taken within a week of the event they're viewing. Those who present certification of vaccination would be exempt from that requirement. Meanwhile, Japan's medical establishment is becoming increasingly anxious about bringing together 78 000 people from 200 countries for the games. The country is struggling to keep coronavirus infections under control and speed up vaccinations.

[2] Peru: case count
Date: Tue 1 Jun 2021 02:46 EDT
Source: The Guardian [edited]
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/01/peru-has-worlds-worst-per-capita-covid-toll-after-death-data-revised


Peru has almost tripled its official COVID-19 death toll to 180 764 after a government review, making it the country with the highest death rate per capita, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Peru has been among the hardest hit Latin American countries during the pandemic, with its hospitals overcrowded and demand for oxygen outstripping availability. The government said it would update its death count, which was 69 342 as of Sunday [30 May 2021], in part because of a lack of testing that made it difficult to confirm whether a person had died due to the virus or some other cause.

According to Johns Hopkins data, Hungary had the highest number of COVID-19 deaths per capita, at about 300 per 100 000 people. With its updated death toll, Peru stands at more than 500 COVID-19 deaths per 100 000 people.

"We think it is our duty to make public this updated information," said the Peruvian prime minister, Violeta Bermudez, at a news conference announcing the result of the review. "What is being said is that a significant number of deaths were not classified as caused by COVID-19," the health minister, Oscar Ugarte, said. Ugarte said that previously only those who had received a positive diagnostic test were considered to have died from the virus, but other criteria have since been incorporated.

Questions about Peru's death toll surfaced soon after the pandemic struck. Scenes of cemeteries filling up with new burials and hospitals buying refrigerated containers to act as makeshift morgues suggested the situation was far worse than the official data showed.

In Latin America, Brazil has the highest total COVID-19 death toll with more than 450 000 lives lost because of the pandemic. Based on population, however, Peru's per capita death toll is more than double that of Brazil, according to the data.

Peru's updated numbers are in line with so-called excess death figures, which researchers have used in Peru and other countries to measure possible undercounting during the pandemic. Excess deaths data measures the total number of deaths over a period of time and compares it with the same period pre-pandemic.

Variants can avoid antibodies, but not T cells
----------------------------------------------
One of the dangers of variant versions of COVID-19 is their ability to escape our immunity, potentially rendering current vaccines less effective. Now 2 new studies -- one in vaccinated people and one in those with immunity acquired from a previous infection -- have found that while antibodies generated by the original strain of the virus are less able to recognize variants, another part of our immune system, the T cells, had no such problem. And that may be enough. A 3rd study found that T cell immunity can compensate for a lower or absent antibody response.

Vaccines work for cancer patients
---------------------------------
Many people undergoing treatment for cancer are taking drugs that suppress the immune system, which could make vaccines for COVID-19 less effective. But a new study has found that around 90% of cancer patients undergoing active treatment who received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine had adequate antibody responses to the vaccine, though the level of response was lower than in healthy controls.

Low testosterone linked to more severe COVID-19 in men
------------------------------------------------------
Men with COVID-19 tend to fare worse, on average, than women, and many doctors and researchers have speculated that hormonal differences, possibly in testosterone levels, may be to blame. But new research has found that it is actually low testosterone levels in men that is associated with more severe disease. The low hormone levels do not necessarily cause severe disease -- they could be a marker of some other physiological effect -- but the researchers urge caution on some treatments being studied that focus on blocking or lowering testosterone to treat COVID-19 in men.

The burden of long-term COVID-19 on families
--------------------------------------------
The ongoing, persistent, and often debilitating symptoms that many people experience even after recovering from COVID-19 are placing a huge burden on both the patients and the family members who must care for them. A survey of COVID-19 survivors and their families found that almost all of them were plagued by feelings of worry, frustration, and sadness, and many experienced disruptions to family activities, sleep, and their sex life. More than half reported an increase in family expenses. The number of families experiencing these issues is likely to be significant. Another study found that 45% of people hospitalized for COVID-19 left hospital in significantly worse physical condition than before their illness, and nearly 20% of patients lost so much ability they were no longer able to live independently after their release.

Opioid deaths spiked in Ontario during the 1st wave
----------------------------------------------
The weekly number of opioid-related deaths in Ontario rose by 135% during the 1st 6 months of the pandemic, with the most rapid increase occurring among those under the age of 35. In total, 1237 people died of opioid-related causes during that time period, compared with 766 in the same 6 months of the previous year [2019]. The researchers say that increased social isolation and reductions in addiction services due to pandemic-related public health measures contributed to the increase in opioid deaths.

[Gomes T, Kitchen SA, Murray R. Measuring the burden of opioid-related mortality in Ontario, Canada, during the COVID-19 pandemic. JAMA Netw Open. 2021; 4(5): e 2112865; doi: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.12865.]

How well you taste bitter flavours is linked to COVID-19 outcomes
---------------------------------------------------------------
People who experience low intensity of bitter tastes, or no bitter tastes, are significantly more likely to test positive for COVID-19, to be hospitalized, and to be sick for longer. Conversely, those who experience greater intensity of bitter tastes are less likely to get sick. The researchers suggest that the genes linked to bitter taste receptors are closely associated with genes related to the strength of the innate immune system.

[Barham HP, Taha MA, Broyles ST, et al. Association between bitter taste receptor phenotype and clinical outcomes among patients with COVID-19. JAMA Netw Open. 2021; 4(5): e2111410. doi: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.11410.]

How COVID-19 causes rare inflammatory disease in children
-----------------------------------------------------------
Less than 1% of children infected with COVID-19 go on to develop a dangerous condition called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, or MIS-C, and researchers have now uncovered the mechanism that causes that complication. They found that viral particles remaining in the gut long after an initial COVID-19 infection can travel into the bloodstream, where they cause the hyperinflammatory immune response that is typical of MIS-C. The good news is that this mechanism also suggests a possible way to treat the condition, which the researchers intend to test in clinical trials soon.

[Yonker LM, Gilboa T, Ogata AF, et al. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children is driven by zonulin-dependent loss of gut mucosal barrier. J Clin Invest. 2021; doi: https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI149633.]

Mass gatherings boosted COVID-19 during Malaysian election
-----------------------------------------------------------
Mass gatherings during an election in the Malaysian state of Sabah directly caused 70% of COVID-19 cases detected in the state after the election, and indirectly caused 64% of cases elsewhere in Malaysia. The election involved mandated in-person voting and political rallies, both of which resulted in a significant increase in interstate travel and in-person gatherings by voters, politicians and campaign workers.

Before the election, Malaysia had an average of 16 newly diagnosed COVID-19 cases per day for nearly 4 months. After the election, that number jumped to 190 cases per day for 17 days until lockdown policies were reinstated. The research highlights the importance of maintaining public health measures and finding alternative methods for holding elections during a pandemic.

[4] News scan: reinfections rare
Date: Tue 1 Jun 2021

COVID-19 infection was 94% less likely in people previously infected than in those never infected, according to a research letter late last week in JAMA Internal Medicine. However, the researchers note, their study concluded before COVID-19 variants became dominant. The researchers followed 1579 COVID-positive patients and 13 496 COVID-negative patients who received reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) diagnoses from February to July 2020 in Lombardy, Italy. After an average follow-up time of 280 days (end date, 28 Feb 2021), 5 previously COVID-infected patients tested positive again via RT-PCR (0.3%), and 528 people were infected for the 1st time (3.9%).

The hazard ratio for reinfection compared with initial infection was 0.06 (95% confidence interval, 0.05 to 0.08). Incidence density was 1.0 per 100 000 person days for those with a prior infection and 15.1 for those without. Patients were a median age of 59, and most were older or from the industrial area of Legnano. Reinfection was defined as a 2nd positive RT-PCR test at least 90 days from the 1st positive diagnosis and with at least 2 consecutive negative diagnoses in between.

"Because it is likely that immunization plus history of natural infection is better protection than natural infection alone, all persons should be encouraged to get vaccinated even if they have been previously infected with SARS-CoV-2," adds Mitchell H Katz, in an editor's note.

Editor's note 28 May 2021
Katz MH. Protection because of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. JAMA Intern Med. 2021; doi: 10.1001/jamainternmed.2021.2966.

"How much protection against future infections does prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 infection provide? This is an important question for advising individual patients, as well as for projecting future outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2.

"In this issue of JAMA Internal Medicine, Vitale and colleagues (1) use the results of diagnostic reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction tests in Lombardy, Italy, to compare the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among persons with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection with persons who tested negative for the virus.

"The differences were dramatic. The incidence density per 100 000 person days was 1.0 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.5-1.5) for persons with a history of infection and 15.1 (CI 14.5-15.7) for persons without a history of infection. These results complement those of Harvey and colleagues from the US, who found that patients with a positive diagnostic nucleic acid amplification test result for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were much less likely to develop SARS-CoV-2 infection at 90 days than persons without antibodies.

Before assuming that people with documented SARS-CoV-2 infections, whether by polymerase chain reaction diagnostic testing or by presence of antibodies, are protected against future infections, there are 2 caveats: 1st, we do not know how long natural immunity lasts; 2nd, we do not know if natural immunity to the wild-type virus is equally protective for SARS-CoV-2 variants (viruses with genetic variations). As has been indicated by Spellberg and colleagues, achieving herd immunity through natural infection is a long and painful process, and, historically, the only human disease to be eradicated, smallpox, was eradicated through vaccination, not natural infection.

Because it is likely that immunization plus history of natural infection is better protection than natural infection alone, all persons should be encouraged to get vaccinated even if they have been previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Although unproven, it is possible that vaccination provides broader immunity to variants than natural infection. And because we do not know how long vaccine protection will last or whether there will be variants that escape protection from vaccination, we may need immunization boosters and or reformulated vaccinations in the future." - Mod.LK]

[5] News scan: adverse events post-infection and vaccination
Date: Tue 1 Jun 2021

An increased risk of adverse events after the 1st Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-vaccine dose was associated with previous COVID-19 infection, according to a letter to the editor late last week in the Journal of Infection. The researchers surveyed 974 UK healthcare workers (mean age, 48.9 years) who received their 1st dose of the Pfizer vaccine. One in 4 (27.2%) had a previous positive PCR or antibody test result, and 30 of them said they were experiencing long COVID (median duration, 9.3 months).

Female sex and younger age were associated with increased risk of COVID-19 vaccination adverse events, but data also showed that those with previous COVID infections were associated with more vaccine symptoms (1.61 vs 0.89) and vaccine symptom severity (2.7 vs 1.5 symptom-days) after adjustments were made for age and sex. The commonest symptoms were fever, fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain, and lymph node pathology. Long COVID-19 was not linked with an increase in adverse events post-vaccination.

"Importantly, among those with prior COVID-19, there was no significant relationship between illness-vaccine time interval and other composite score [of symptom nature and severity]," write the researchers, "nor any difference in mean time interval based on presence of any of the symptoms."
