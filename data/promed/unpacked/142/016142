Health authorities indicate that cases of hantavirus [infection] are the
consequence of climatic changes and environmental damage in the Chaco
region of Paraguay, where the cases of the disease have occurred.

Currently, there are 25 suspected [hantavirus infection] cases, based on
symptoms, which are compatible with those of the disease. Of these, 3 have
been laboratory confirmed, and to date there have been 4 deaths, all from
the endemic area in Central Chaco.

Health authorities are concerned due to the upcoming Chaco rally event,
which will begin on [21 Sep 2008].

The health surveillance director, Dr Ivan Allende, stated that cases of
hantavirus [infection] can occur through out the year, "in fact, at this
time the outbreak is related to changes that have taken place in the
ecological niche, involving an extensive area of deforestation, which
modifies the biodiversity of the natural predators, the mice that transmit
the disease [virus]," the doctor emphasized.

The vice minister of health, Dr Edgar Gimenez, mentioned that "the Ministry
of Health has activated a joint effort with SEAM [Paraguayan government
Secretariat for the Environment] to evaluate the environmental damage in
the outbreak zone, in order to take measures related [to the damage] so
that the deforestation [situation] can be corrected. " Also, all the
surveillance units of the 18 health regions have been activated before the
appearance of any [hantavirus infection] symptoms."

He indicated, also, that during the coming week a concrete plan focused on
the rally will be advanced through the communications media, on the theme
of management of food, camps, and appropriate actions in the deforested
areas to prevent spread of the disease.

In this sense, he announced that they are carrying out follow-up of people
exposed to the disease [virus] during the same period as those who
developed symptoms. "The surveillance has been extended to the whole
country, because they have taken note that some 400 people left the Chaco,
and currently are in their home places." The incubation period is up to 6
weeks, so that people who were in the Campo Bello or La Patria farms
[Boqueron department] should consult [with a doctor] should they develop
symptoms such as headache, fever, myalgia, depression or prostration,
nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.

[This is a continuation of the outbreak reported in ProMED-mail archive no.
20080826.2667. There is still no information concerning which hantavirus is
involved in this outbreak.

Hantaviruses that cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome and could be involved
in these cases include Bermejo virus (in _Oligoryzomys chacoensis_, Chacoan
pygmy rice rat) found in Paraguay; Laguna Negra virus (in _Calomys laucha_,
small vesper mouse; and _C. callosus_, large vesper mouse) found in west
Paraguay, Bolivia, west Brazil; and Oran virus (in _Oligoryzomys
longicaudatus_, long-tailed pygmy rice rat) found in north western
Argentina, southern Bolivia, and probably is present in Paraguay.

Alto Paraguay virus (in _Holochilus chacarius_, Chaco marsh rat) is found
in NW Paraguay but is not associated with human disease.

ProMED-mail thanks Dr James Mills for an inventory list of hantaviruses.

CDC (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) has an excellent
PowerPoint presentation on hantaviruses available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/hanta/hps/noframes/hpsslideset/hpsslides1-12.htm>.

The Chaco region of western Paraguay includes the departments of Alto
Paraguay, Boqueron, and Presidente Hayes, which can be located on the map
