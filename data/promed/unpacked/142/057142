Nobody likes ticks to begin with, but an increase in cat illness could give pet owners yet another reason to hate the parasites.

Local [Lebanon, Laclede County, Missouri] veterinarian Dr Dane Frazier told the Daily Record that he has seen 6 cases of bobcat fever in 2 weeks, compared with the 2 cases per year that he usually sees. More properly called cytauxzoonosis, bobcat fever is a usually fatal tickborne disease that infects the red blood cells of domesticated cats. As the disease's name suggests, it also affects bobcats, but bobcats usually recover from the ailment.

[According to the Merck Veterinary Manual:
"Cytauxzoonosis caused by _Cytauxzoon felis_ was 1st reported in the USA in 1976; since then, it has become an important emerging infectious disease in domestic cats. _Cytauxzoon_ spp are protozoan parasites classified within the family Theileriidae, along with _Theileria_ spp and _Gonderia_ spp. More recent molecular characterizations of these organisms have resulted in some dispute about the taxonomic status of _Cytauxzoon_ spp, but its multiplication by schizogony in mononuclear phagocytes (macrophages), rather than lymphocytes as for _Theileria_ spp, is a strong argument for maintaining its classification in a separate genus."

_Cytauxzoon felis_ has been previously reported in domestic cats in Missouri, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia, so this outbreak in Missouri is not unexpected.
