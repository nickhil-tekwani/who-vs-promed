28 Apr 2004, SARS epidemic situation issues paper
-------------------------------------------------
From the Medical Department Public Office News release 28 Apr 2004
Between 10 AM 27 Apr 2004 and 10 AM 28 Apr 2004, Beijing reported the
isolation of a [new] patient suspected of having SARS. There are no
additional case reports from other provinces.
The new case reported by Beijing is a 49 year old woman, a retired doctor
from Beijing Xuanwu district. On 9 Apr 2004, the patient had a chest
infection with fluid in the chest cavity and was admitted to the Xuanwu
Hospital emergency medical treatment ward. Three days later she was
transferred to another hospital in Beijing when information became
available that she had shared a hospital ward with the nurse who had cared
for the index case [hence this patient would be a 3rd-generation case -
Mod.MPP]. On 22 Apr 2004 bilateral pulmonary infiltrates were noted and she
was transferred to another hospital for isolation. On 27 Apr 2004 she was
diagnosed as a suspected case of SARS based on clinical and epidemiologic
findings. At present the patient is in a serious condition with bilateral
infiltrates and respiratory failure.
An update on the cases in Beijing: The nurse who cared for the index
patient in Anhui is stable, now with 12 consecutive days without fever;
there are 6 suspected cases in isolation and one close contact with fever.
13 individuals have been released from observation.
In Anhui, the index patient continues to improve, now 5 consecutive days
without fever. No close contacts in Anhui under observation have developed
signs of pneumonia, and 38 individuals have been released from observation.
In addition, there have been no reports of undiagnosed pneumonia since 20
Mar 2004 from other provinces where increased surveillance has been
implemented.
Information on visitors from Australia, Russia, South Korea and Japan to
the viral laboratory [the China CDC virology laboratory] during the period
1-18 Mar 2004 was reported to the countries in question and WHO, and to
date, no illness has been reported among these visitors.
In summary, since 22 Apr 2004, Anhui Province has reported one [probable]
case of SARS and 1 suspected case of SARS; Beijing has reported one
[probable case of SARS] and 6 suspected cases of SARS. There have been no
reports of additional cases from other provinces.

[The additional 3rd generation case (the newly reported case) is
unsurprising, as identification of SARS as an etiology was delayed until
after the onset of illness in a 2nd generation case. This "allowed" for
continued contact of 1st and 2nd generation cases with others before
appropriate infection control/isolation precautions were implemented.
The newswires are filled with statements on international actions directed
at early detection of possible SARS, reminiscent of the activities in 2003.
Many of the Asian and Pacific Rim countries have implemented the use of
thermal scanners at ports of entry (airports particularly mentioned);
further distant, countries in the Western Hemisphere have been distributing
health advisory notices to passengers arriving from China similar to those
used in 2003 -- a sign of increased international concern to avoid a repeat
of 2003's multi-country outbreak. - Mod.MPP]
