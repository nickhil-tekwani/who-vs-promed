Concern over levels of brown rust reported in winter wheat crops is growing and the disease will require monitoring and early treatment in the worst cases. Rampant brown rust 'could be the worst since 2007', the previous bad brown rust season.

The warmest December [2015] on record has resulted in some crops drowning in a soup of disease, with septoria, yellow rust, and mildew all widespread - particularly in early-drilled fields. Warmer temperatures have shortened the latent period.

Winter wheat crops are under threat from very active yellow rust with a bad disease year now in prospect. A disease alert [has been issued]. A mild and wet winter is ideal for the disease's spread and reports were seen as early as November [2015] with some susceptible wheat varieties plastered with the yellow spores.

Levels of yellow rust reached the highest on record in 2014, and with mild weather and aggressive disease strains it looks a safe bet that the disease will be serious this [2015/16] season. Many growers will be unable to get on rain-soaked fields, so those with yellow rust should monitor fields and may have to treat before the traditional March timing if possible.

Growers are also reporting mildew and septoria in wheat, phoma and light leaf spot in oilseed rape.

Agronomists are reporting higher level of aphids in crops putting them at risk from diseases such as Barley Yellow Dwarf Virus (BYDV) in cereals and Turnip Yellows Virus (TuYV) in oilseed rape.

[Diseases mentioned above are:

Wheat
-----
Leaf rust (also called brown rust), caused by the fungus _Puccinia recondita_ (synonym _P. triticina_); stripe rust (also called yellow rust), caused by the fungus _Puccinia striiformis_ (previously var. _striiformis_ or _tritici_); septoria disease complex (_Mycosphaerella graminicola_, previously _Septoria tritici_ and _Phaeosphaeria nodorum_); powdery (_Erysiphe graminis_ f. sp. _tritici_, _Blumeria graminis_) and/or downy mildew (_Sclerophthora macrospora_, crazy top); barley yellow dwarf (BYD) disease caused by viruses in several species in the family _Luteoviridae_ (mostly in the genus _Luteovirus_).

Oilseed rape
------------
Light leaf spot (LLS) of _Brassica_ species caused by the fungus _Pyrenopeziza brassicae_; blackleg (also called phoma stem canker or leaf spot) caused by the fungus _Leptosphaeria maculans_; _Turnip yellows virus_ (TuYV), genus _Polerovirus_ (_Luteoviridae_).

These pathogens can seriously affect crop yields. For more information on the diseases, see links below and previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives.
