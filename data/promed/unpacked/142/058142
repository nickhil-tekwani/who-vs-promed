Parents are being warned of the dangers of not getting their children vaccinated following an outbreak of rubella across the county. Latest figures have revealed that there have been 14 confirmed cases of the potentially dangerous infection in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight between January and July this year [2012] compared to none during the same period in 2011. Although the infection can easily be prevented by youngsters receiving their measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) jabs, if caught, it can be dangerous, particularly to pregnant women, causing rubella-associated miscarriages and birth defects.

Rubella is a viral infection that is spread in a similar way as a cold and will normally pass [end] within 7 to 10 days. But it becomes serious if a pregnant woman catches the infection during the 1st 16 weeks of pregnancy as it can disrupt the development of the baby, causing congenital rubella syndrome which could include cataracts, deafness, heart abnormalities and brain damage.

It is believed the outbreak has been caused by a dip in the number of children getting vaccinated, forcing health bosses to urge parents into action. To reduce the risk of such outbreaks, health bosses aim to get 95 per cent of 3-year-olds vaccinated, but between January and March this year [2012], only 89 per cent in Hampshire and 91 per cent in Southampton received their pre-school booster MMR jab. Parents are being asked to speak with their health visitors for advice about vaccinations and arrange for their child to get their jabs at their local surgery.

Dr Ruth Milton, director of public health in Hampshire, said: "The uptake for MMR1 should be even better, but we are most concerned about the MMR2, the pre-school booster given after your child is 3. Every child requires 2 doses of the vaccine to protect them from all 3 diseases. When we reach the 95 per cent target, we have herd immunity, where enough of the population is immunised to protect those that aren't. Parents have a really important role to play in this by making sure they get their children vaccinated when sent reminder letters."

[Rubella is an acute, contagious viral infection. While the illness is generally mild in children, it has serious consequences in pregnant women, causing fetal death or congenital defects known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). The rubella virus is transmitted by airborne droplets when infected people sneeze or cough. Humans are the only known host. In children, the disease is usually mild, with symptoms including a rash, low fever (under 39 C), nausea and mild conjunctivitis. The rash, which occurs in 50-80 percent of cases, usually starts on the face and neck before progressing down the body and lasts 1-3 days. Swollen lymph glands behind the ears and in the neck are the most characteristic clinical feature. Infected adults, more commonly women, may develop arthritis and painful joints that usually last from 3-10 days. Once a person is infected, the virus spreads throughout the body in about 5-7 days. Symptoms usually appear 2-3 weeks after exposure. The most infectious period is usually 1-5 days after the appearance of the rash.

When a woman is infected with the rubella virus early in pregnancy, she has a 90 percent chance of passing the virus on to her fetus. This can cause miscarriage, stillbirth or severe birth defects known as CRS. Infants with CRS may excrete the virus for a year or more. Children with CRS can suffer hearing impairments, eye and heart defects and other lifelong disabilities, including autism, diabetes mellitus and thyroid dysfunction, many of which require costly therapy, surgeries and other expensive care.

The rubella vaccine is a live [naturally] attenuated strain that has been in use for more than 40 years. A single dose gives more than 95 percent long-lasting immunity, which is similar to that induced by natural infection. In the UK, rubella vaccine is usually administered as part of the triple MMR vaccine. The occurrence of rubella disease is an indication of less than adequate uptake of MMR vaccine. That apart, it is not clear why the incidence is currently so high in Hampshire.
