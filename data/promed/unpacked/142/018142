One person has died while 11 others are being treated for suspected anthrax after consuming meat from hippos that died a fortnight ago in Binga's Mlibizi area.

The Ministry of Health and Child Care has since deployed a team to the area to fight the outbreak. The Matabeleland North Provincial Medical Director Dr Nyasha Masuka said the death of the 19-year-old man at Siansundu Clinic on [Wed 18 Apr 2017] is suspected to be related to an anthrax outbreak in the area. "A man who showed signs and symptoms of anthrax admitted to have eaten hippo meat which he was given by a relative living in Saba ward. Anthrax infected hippos started dying as from [27 Mar 2017] and this man consumed the meat on [12 Apr 2017]. He had ulcers on the mouth and face and complained of severe headaches. He visited the hospital a few das ago and died within 7 days," he said.

"It is unfortunate that our health team focused on Saba ward villagers only, since this man from a neighbouring village was least suspected to have anthrax because they were not aware of the outbreak." Dr Masuka said that health officials were facing a challenge fighting the outbreak as villagers were not opening up or being honest as to whether they consumed the meat from hippos or not. He said 1.5 kg [3.3 lbs.] of hippo meat was found mixed with 45 kg [99 lbs.] of goat meat on sale in a butchery at Binga Centre and has since been destroyed to eliminate human contact with the contaminated meat.

"We had dispatched a team which went into Saba village and had to check for signs and symptoms on the villagers' bodies after many denied to have eaten the meat. It is after receiving the report on the now deceased that we realized that we had to recheck all the people in surrounding villages. Apparently, they are now opening up to having shared the meat with relatives in neighboring villages," said Dr Masuka.

He said awareness campaigns will be intensified to warn villagers of dangers associated with eating meat from animals that die under unclear circumstances. "They are being notified of the signs and symptoms of human anthrax so that the affected seek treatment as soon as possible." Dr Masuka said. He said that there were 58 villagers, including children, whom health workers were following up on for possible infection.

"We have so far treated 11 people from Siansundu village for anthrax and our teams are closely monitoring 58 others who also ate meat from the dead hippos for any signs or symptoms of the disease. The samples were sent to the National Reference Laboratory in Harare for confirmation," Dr Masuka said.

For a description of Matabeleland North on the western border of Zimbabwe with Zambia, go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matabeleland_North_Province. Binga District lies along the border with Zimbabwe and the Zambezi River valley; see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binga_District. It can be seen on the map at http://tinyurl.com/kkn6l9s.

This article above has a good map showing where this is happening in NW Zimbabwe, on the border with Zambia. There is also a picture of a decomposing bloated hippo carcass floating in the river.

I am puzzled why the Binga Centre butcher mixed just 1.5 kg of hippo with 45 kg of goat meat. I suspect that there is a typo here as it would more likely be just 4.5 kg from a single goat carcass. 1.5 kg mixed in 45 kg adds little value. Yesterday's [20 Apr 2017; 20170420.4983066] account also had these weights of 1.5 and 45 kg so there might have been some unchecked journalistic plagiarism going on.

The Heath Service folk are to be congratulated on admitting a mistake and for their hard work in finding exposed and possibly sick people. - Mod.MHJ]
