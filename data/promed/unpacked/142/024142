To date 16 people have died and 123 taken ill after they consumed spurious liquor in Lucknow and bordering Unnao district [Uttar Pradesh]. The incident took place on Sunday evening [11 Jan 2015] when people had gathered to watch a local cricket match.

Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, who has called an emergency review meeting, has suspended 10 officials, including Malihabad's Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Circle Officer (Deputy SP [superintendent of police]), Station House officer, District Excise Officer, Assistant Excise Commissioner (Enforcement) and Excise Inspector. He has sought explanation from Excise Commissioner and ordered departmental action against Joint Excise Commissioner.

Police have arrested [a resident] of Datali village in Lucknow's Malihabad area. "It appears that a majority of the people who had come to watch the (cricket) match, had purchased the liquor from [him] and fell ill," said SP of Lucknow (Rural) Habibul Hasan.

Police claimed to have recovered 50 litres of spurious liquor from [the man's] house. IG [inspector general] (Lucknow Zone) Subhash Chandra said the seized liquor would be sent for examination and police will probe the source of the toxic methyl alcohol that was supplied to the accused.

Chief Medical Officer SNS Yadav said the symptoms, so far, indicates that methyl alcohol was mixed with the country-made liquor leading to the deaths. According to him, the condition of nearly 15 patients is critical and 7 are on ventilator.

Chief Minister has announced ex-gratia of Rs 2 lakh (USD 3222) each to the kin of the deceased and free treatment to those admitted in the hospitals.

At least 10 people have died and 45 others have been left seriously ill after consuming fake alcohol in India.

Illicit alcohol has killed at least 10 people in India and left 45 others seriously ill. The incident occurred in the Malihabad area of Lucknow, the capital of the state of Uttar Pradesh.

Those taken ill were rushed to King George's Medical University Trauma Centre and doctors say at least 6 more people are critically ill, reported the Hindustan Times.

Police and administrative teams rushed to the village and are now investigating the casualties, which were believed to have been caused by the consumption of fake alcohol.

"Some of the victims have come and several others are there," said Doctor SN Sankhwar, head of the Trauma Centre. "Therefore we have sent 4 ambulances to the village in Malihabad to bring more of them."

Illicit alcohol trading has blighted the alcohol industry for decades causing hundreds of deaths all over the world.

At the end of last year [2014], figures released showed more than 50 people in Iran had died after consuming fake alcohol between March and September the same year.

[Methanol (wood alcohol) is produced from the destructive distillation of wood. Epidemics of methanol toxicity have resulted from the consumption of methanol-contaminated whiskey or other alcohol products. The formation of 2 toxic metabolites, formaldehyde and formic acid, causes methanol poisoning. The elimination rate depends upon the folate pool. In primates, it is generally small, and, consequently, primates (including humans) are more sensitive to methanol toxicity than other animals.

Methanol is widely available in formulations including antifreeze, windshield washer fluid, Sterno canned heat, shellacs, various paints, paint removers, varnishes, duplicating fluids, and gasoline additives.

Fatalities have been reported after ingestion of 15 ml or 3 teaspoons of a 40 per cent solution, although 30 ml is generally considered a minimal lethal dose. With aggressive medical care, it is possible to survive the ingestion of 500-600 ml. However, consumption of as little as 10 ml may cause blindness, depending on the amount and individual tolerance.

Methanol is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and peak levels occur generally within 30-90 minutes. It is distributed into tissues, so concentrations in the vitreous humor and optic nerve are high. The highest concentrations are found in the kidney, liver, and gastrointestinal tract, with smaller concentrations in the brain, muscle, and adipose tissues.

Methanol is oxidized 10 times more slowly than ethanol. Consequently, there is a longer elimination half-life.

Onset of symptoms varies between 40 minutes and 72 hours after ingestion. Co-ingestion with alcohol will delay the appearance of symptoms, but the absence of symptoms does not exclude serious toxicity. The usual latent period is 12-24 hours.

Clinical signs may include headache, vertigo, lethargy, and confusion, which are common in mild to moderate ethanol intoxications. Coma and convulsions appear in severe cases, probably as a result of cerebral edema. Methanol produces little to no euphoria, unlike ethanol.

Blurred vision, decreased visual acuity, and photophobia (sensitivity to light) are common complaints. Constricted visual fields, fixed and dilated pupils, retinal edema, and hyperemia of the optic disk are common clinical findings. Prompt initial therapy is necessary to reverse symptoms, though visual defects have persisted in up to 25 per cent of severe cases.

Methanol is a mucosal irritant and may produce nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, not unlike large doses of ethanol.

Early in the clinical course, gut decontamination with ipecac or lavage may be indicated. However, if the methanol is mixed with ethanol, these patients may not realize something is out of the ordinary until it is too late for this type of treatment to be helpful.

Intravenous administration of ethanol in a 10 per cent dextrose solution may be helpful. As ethanol prolongs the elimination half-life of methanol, the treatment may take several days, and the patient should be hospitalized. Dialysis may be necessary to prevent kidney failure as well. Hemodialysis remains an effective treatment.
