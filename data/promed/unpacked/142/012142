The authorized person for children's rights in Uzbekistan, Aliya Yunusova, jointly with the first deputy prosecutor of the region, the head of the regional health department, and other responsible persons on 24 Dec [2022] conducted an inquiry into the child [deaths] presumed to be due to taking Dok-1 Max [compound pharmaceutical preparation].

From September to December [2022], 21 patients with acute renal failure were examined and treated at the Samarkand Regional Children's Multidisciplinary Medical Center. The patients were from the Jizzakh, Kashkadarya, Navoi, and Samarkand regions; 3 patients were treated at home, and 18 died. Some children were under 6 years of age, and 15 of them were under 3 years of age.

Parents stated their children had symptoms of a cold and their condition worsened after taking Dok-1 Max.

According to experts, instructions for use of Dok-1 Max indicate the drug can be used from the age of 2, but drugs from other companies with this composition (paracetamol 500 mg, guaifenesin 200 mg, phenylephrine hydrochloride 10 mg) are generally allowed to apply after [restricted to use by children over (is how I read this. - Mod.SH)] 12 years of age.

Under Article 40 of the Law 'On the Protection of the Health of Citizens', pathological-anatomical studies are carried out in healthcare institutions for a lifetime, and post-mortem diagnostics (biopsy, autopsy) as well as monitoring the correctness of clinical diagnosis and treatment of the disease, obtaining reliable data on causes of death. 'However, none of the deceased patients were subjected to the post-mortem examination,' the report said.

At the moment, a working group formed by the Ministry of Health continues to study this case. The prosecutor's office of the city of Samarkand is investigating every cause of the casualty. 'Dear parents, do not neglect the health of your children! Do not give them over-the-counter medications without a doctor's recommendation. Incorrect use of medicines can cause serious harm to the health of your child,' the message reads.

The Ministry of Health of Uzbekistan has confirmed that the number of children who have died since September [2022] after using the Doc-1 Max syrup is 18. This was previously reported by children's ombudsperson Aliya Yunusova. It was reported earlier about 15 deaths of children.

The report of the Ministry of Health, published on Tuesday [27 Dec 2022], provides the results of an investigation conducted by a special working group.

Tablets and syrup Doc-1 Max, produced by the Indian Marion Biotech, were registered in Uzbekistan in 2012 and released for sale from the same year. Each party of the drug was tested and given a certificate of conformity, the Agency for the Development of the Pharmaceutical Network. The medicine is imported to Uzbekistan by Quramax Medical.

The investigation confirmed that after taking the syrup Doc-1 Max, 21 children were hospitalized with acute respiratory diseases; 18 of them died. The Ministry noted the deceased children before admission to the hospital took the drug at home with other drugs for 2-7 days, 3-4 times a day, at a dosage of 2.5-5 ml, which was higher than the dose suitable for children.

"All children were given the drug without a doctor's prescription. Since the main substance in the drug is paracetamol, Doc-1 Max syrup was incorrectly used as a remedy for colds on their own by parents or on the recommendation of pharmacy sellers," the Ministry added.

The Ministry said primary laboratory studies showed the presence of ethylene glycol in the Doc-1 Max syrup. This drug is toxic, its 95% solution, when applied at 1-2 ml/kg, causes serious changes in the patient's health, namely vomiting, loss of consciousness, an epileptic attack, problems in the circulatory system, and acute renal failure.

Seven officials were relieved of their posts, and disciplinary measures were applied to a number of specialists for negligence in official duties, including failure to take necessary measures related to the death of children.

All collected documents were sent to law enforcement agencies to initiate a criminal case, the Ministry of Health reported. Tablets and syrup Doc-1 Max were withdrawn from all pharmacies in Uzbekistan. The shortcomings and the issue of responsibility of medical workers will be considered at a special meeting of the ministry, the report says.

[This is a most tragic situation. Our sympathies to the affected families.

The symptoms of the children are not well described, but if symptoms worsen after taking the medication, it should be discontinued immediately, and the person/child should be taken to a medical provider.

Ethylene glycol is toxic.

"Ethylene glycol's toxicity mainly results from the accumulation of its toxic metabolites.

"Ethylene glycol is a central nervous system (CNS) depressant that produces acute effects similar to those of ethanol. These CNS effects predominate during the 1st hours after exposure.

"If undetected or untreated, ethylene glycol ingestion can cause serious or fatal toxicity."

"A 3-stage theory of ethylene glycol poisoning was introduced in the 1950s (Berman et al, 1957; Kahn and Brotchner, 1950). These stages are theoretical descriptions of ethylene glycol poisoning, but the onset and progression of the clinical course is frequently not consistent or predictable. One stage might predominate, whereas another stage might be absent (Jammalamadaka and Raissi, 2010).

"The 3 stages include the following:
- Stage 1 (the neurological stage) occurs within 30 minutes to 12 hours after ingestion.
- Stage 2 (the cardiopulmonary stage) occurs between 12 and 24 hours after ingestion.
- Stage 3 (the renal stage) occurs between 24 and 72 hours after ingestion."
(https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/csem/ethylene-propylene-glycol/toxicological_effects.html)

The time frame of each stage may be more or less and depends upon the individual's state of health. Ethylene glycol can affect almost every system in the human body and is quite serious, needing immediate medical attention.

While these individuals are gone, and families have a lot of healing to do, we certainly hope an investigation reveals how this horrible situation occurred and can be rectified so it never occurs again. - Mod.TG
