One person who contracted legionnaires' disease amid a cluster of cases in the Morris Park section of the Bronx has died, the authorities said on [Wed 30 Sep 2015], as health officials ordered cooling towers infected with the bacteria to be cleaned. 13 people in the area, all of whom had serious underlying medical conditions, began to experience symptoms in September [2015]. The disease is caused by legionella bacteria, which inspectors discovered in recent days in 15 nearby cooling towers on top of buildings.

The cluster was unrelated to an outbreak of the disease in the South Bronx in July and August [2015] that killed 12 people and sickened more than 120, health officials have said. Those cases stemmed from a contaminated cooling tower atop a hotel.

City officials responded to that outbreak by putting into effect a host of legislative and regulatory programs to help prevent the disease. These included a new measure requiring building owners to conduct quarterly inspections of cooling towers, and to certify that their towers have been inspected, tested, cleaned, and disinfected -- efforts that health officials said sped up the investigation into the Morris Park cluster.

On Wednesday afternoon [30 Sep 2015], mayor Bill de Blasio, the city health commissioner and several elected leaders visited the Morris Park Association, a senior center, to discuss the flurry of cases and urge residents to visit a doctor if they notice any flu-like symptoms. The latest cluster was "different than what we experienced a couple of weeks back in the South Bronx," Mr de Blasio said. "This is a much more limited situation."

He said it was a good sign that all 13 who were sickened had started experiencing symptoms by [21 Sep 2015], and that there was no uptick in emergency room visits for pneumonia. Health officials have not said when the single death occurred.

Inspectors took samples from 35 cooling towers in the Morris Park area over the weekend [26-27 Sep 2015], and 15 of them tested positive for legionella. Among those were towers at Lehman High School, the Bronx Psychiatric Center, and 6 buildings associated with the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. The commissioner of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, Dr Mary T Bassett, ordered those buildings "to begin cleaning and disinfection immediately," the health department said in a statement on [Wed 30 Sep 2015].

Some of the patients live in Morris Park and others work there; all of them are middle-aged.

The city planned to hold a town-hall-style meeting on Thursday evening [1 Oct 2015] to answer residents' questions, as the city health department continues to interview patients and try to home in on the source of the cluster. City officials consulted with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday [28 Sep 2015], and also notified the state health commissioner on [Sat 26 Sep 2015].

Every year, there are about 200 to 300 cases of legionnaires' disease in New York City, though clusters like the one in Morris Park are considered more rare.
