From 1 Jul 2017 through 14 Jan 2018, 35 confirmed human cases of yellow fever were reported in Brazil (Figure 1), including 20 deaths and 145 suspected cases who are under investigation. In recent weeks, the number of confirmed human cases of yellow fever has tripled in Brazil, mainly in the states of São Paulo and Minas Gerais. Confirmed cases were notified in the states of São Paulo (20 cases, including 11 deaths), Rio de Janeiro (3 cases, including one death), and Minas Gerais (11 cases, including 7 deaths), and in the Federal District (one fatal case).

All confirmed cases are likely to have acquired their infections in geographic locations where there are documented epizootics in non-human primates. In Minas Gerais cases are reported in municipalities where no human cases were detected during the outbreak in 2016/2017. In São Paulo, the highest proportion of cases is reported in Mairiporã, an area located 15 km [9 mi] from the northern area of the municipality of São Paulo. The new cases in Rio de Janeiro [state] are reported in the municipalities of Valença and Teresópolis; the latter is located 96 kilometers [60 mi] from the city of Rio de Janeiro.

On 11 Jan 2018, a case of yellow fever was confirmed in The Netherlands (PCR positive) in a returning traveller with history of stay in the municipality of Mairiporã and Atibaia, state of São Paulo, Brazil, from 19 Dec 2017 through 8 Jan 2018, an area where the circulation of yellow fever virus is currently occurring. The case has no history of yellow fever vaccination. The onset of illness was 7 Jan 2018, when the patient reported symptoms of high fever, headache, myalgia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea.

Although epizootics have been reported throughout 2017, there was a significant increase from September 2017. The high number of epizootics and animals [non-human primates] concerned indicates a high level of circulation of the virus in ecosystems favorable for transmission. From 1 Jul 2017 through 14 Jan 2018, there were 2442 epizootics in non-human primates reported in 21 federal entities, including areas that were previously not considered to be at risk for yellow fever. Of these, 411 were laboratory-confirmed, 747 are under investigation, 817 were classified as indeterminate and 467 were ruled-out. The confirmed epizootics for yellow fever were reported by 4 states (Mato Grosso, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo); however, the majority (88 percent) of the confirmed epizootics were registered in the state of São Paulo.

Public health response
----------------------
Since September 2017, when yellow fever was confirmed in human cases and epizootics in São Paulo, national authorities have been intensifying vaccination activities through routine and preemptive immunization campaigns. In addition, state and municipality health authorities have been strengthening healthcare services for management of cases and have been carrying out risk communication.

In early January 2018, to reduce the risk of a large yellow fever outbreak, the Brazilian Ministry of Health announced plans to conduct mass yellow fever vaccination campaigns, which will include both standard (0.5 mL) and fractional (0.1 mL) doses. The campaigns will take place in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, from 25 Jan through 17 Feb [2018] and in Bahia, from 19 Feb through 3 Mar [2018]. The aim is to vaccinate 21.8 million people (16.5 million with the fractionated dose and 5.3 million with the standard dose) who live in 77 municipalities in these 3 states.

WHO risk assessment
------------------
The number of epizootics reported since July 2017 continues to be a concern, especially near urban areas of large cities, such as São Paulo, and in municipalities that were previously not considered at risk for yellow fever.

While measures implemented by the Brazilian authorities during the 2016/2017 outbreak have contributed to the occurrence of a smaller number of cases when comparing the periods from 28 Nov 2016 through 15 Jan 2017 with 27 Nov 2017 through 14 Jan 2018. The large number of unvaccinated people who continue to live in areas with ecosystems favorable for transmission of the yellow fever virus represent a elevated risk for the change in the current transmission pattern.

It is expected that the decision of the Brazilian authorities to carry out a mass vaccination campaign against yellow fever, including standard (0.5 ml) and fractional (0.1 ml) doses, can effectively limit the transmission of yellow fever. It is important to note that, due to its scale and scope, this mass vaccination campaign will likely be characterized by significant logistical challenges.

The recent occurrence of a confirmed yellow fever case in an unvaccinated traveller reveals the need for State Parties to reinforce the dissemination of recommendations for international travellers.

The current WHO recommendations for international travellers going to Brazil were updated on 16 Jan 2018 and are available at http://www.who.int/entity/ith/updates/20180116/en/index.html

Travellers returning with viraemia may pose a risk to the establishment of local yellow fever transmission cycles predominantly in areas where the vector is present.

To date, there has been no evidence of yellow fever transmission by _Aedes aegypti_. In entomological studies conducted during the 2016/2017 outbreak in some of the affected states, it was found that the isolated _Haemagogus_ mosquitoes were positive for yellow fever [virus].

WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and review the risk assessment based on the latest available information.

The Minas Gerais government this [Sat 20 Jan 2018] decreed a public health emergency in 3 regions of the state for 6 months, due to yellow fever. The measure covers the regional health units of the municipalities of Belo Horizonte, Itabira, and Ponte Nova -- 94 cities in total.

The decree, issued by the Governor, Fernando Pimentel, authorized adoption of administrative measures necessary to contain the outbreak, especially the public acquisition of supplies and materials. In addition to this, the measure assures contracting of necessary services to attend to the emergency situation.

Cases
-----
With the 2nd epidemiologic period under epidemiological monitoring of cases of yellow fever in Minas Gerais, 22 cases of the disease were confirmed in the state from July of last year [2017] up to the beginning of this year [2018]. According to the state Secretariat of Health, of these, 15 died. During this period, 40 suspected cases were discarded and there are 46 cases in 24 municipalities under investigation.

Currently, the yellow fever vaccine coverage in the state of Minas Gerais is around 82 percent. According to the epidemiological report issued on [Wed 17 Jan 2018], it is estimated that there are in the state a few more than 3 million of these people who have not yet been vaccinated, especially in the 15-59 year age group, which was also the group most affected by sylvan (forest) yellow fever in the epidemic that occurred in 2017.

[The case fatality numbers reported above, at least 15 deaths, are more than the 11 cases including 7 deaths reported in the 22 Jan 2018 WHO report. The dates of coverage of the 2 reports seem to be different and that may account for this difference. Curiously, the WHO report does not mention the health emergency in Minas Gerais state.. - Mod.

[3] São Paulo: vaccine reactions, fatal
Date: Fri 19 Jan 2018

In the Brazilian state of São Paulo, 2 people died from negative reactions to yellow fever vaccinations at a time when thousands of people are jamming into medical centers to be immunized, in view of the big increase in deaths from the disease, officials announced on [Fri 19 Jan 2018].

As Municipal Health Secretary Wilson Pollara stated on the G1 online news site, the victims were 2 people with "low immunity," a woman age 76 and a man whose identity has not yet been revealed.

The vaccine is currently recommended for those between the ages of 9 months and 59 years. People older than that need a medical exam to find out the state of their immune system and to see if they have a high risk of being infected by the vaccine virus or not.

Dr Expedito Luna, an epidemiologist and professor with the Tropical Medicine Institute at the University of São Paulo, said to G1 that since the year 2000 it has been identified in Brazil and other places in the world that a small proportion of those who are vaccinated could develop a serious case of the yellow fever itself.

"In the study of those rare cases with adverse reactions, it turned out to be common among those over age 60, with diseases of the thymus and the immune system, which led to a greater restriction of administering the vaccine in those cases," the doctor said.

Specialists categorize 2 types of yellow fever [transmission], which are differentiated by the infecting mosquito: one is the "wild" [sylvan or forest] kind transmitted by the _Haemagogus_ and the _Sabethes_ species [mosquitoes], which mainly attack monkeys, and the "urban" type, which is transmitted by the _Aedes aegypti_ [mosquito], and also is the vector of dengue, Zika, and chikungunya [viruses].

For several years, however, not one case of yellow fever caused by the urban [transmission] type has been recorded [in Brazil, since 1942].

Southeast Brazil, chiefly the states of Minas Gerais, São Paulo, and Rio de Janeiro, for several weeks have seen an outbreak of this infectious viral disease that is transmitted by mosquito bites and has caused at least 15 deaths.

[Because the yellow fever (YF) vaccine is a live, attenuated virus, there is an extremely small risk that generalized disease may occur in approximately 1 in one million vaccinees. As the report above indicates, the elderly and individuals with co-morbidities are most at risk for adverse vaccine reactions. However, because the risk of death for unvaccinated individuals infected with YF virus in nature is about 30 percent and the risk of an uncontrolled outbreak in an unvaccinated population is extremely high, vaccination is an important individual and public health measure . In localities where active YF virus transmission is occurring, individuals should not hesitate to become vaccinated, nor should public health agencies hesitate to launch aggressive vaccination campaigns. - Mod.TY]
