The death of a 7 year old child, 78 confirmed canine rabies cases, as
well as 11 children bitten by a rabid dog recently demonstrate the
vulnerability of Cochabamba department to rabies.

Throughout this year [2011], Cochabamba department has been one of the
areas most affected by rabies virus, found mainly in stray animals.

"Rabies virus will continue to circulate in the environment, so rather
than worry about influenza A, which will go away, we are angry about
rabies and the cases of these children from Independencia and the
death of this child due to her dog and months-old unvaccinated
puppies," stated the director of epidemiology of SEDES [El Servicio
Departamental de Salud; Departmental Health Services], Efrain
Vallejos.

Last weekend, a 7 year old child died as a result of rabies virus
[infection], and in recent days, a group of 11 children were also
bitten by a [rabid] puppy in the Independencia community. They are
currently undergoing anti-rabies [post exposure] treatment to save
their lives.

"They were playing with a 2 month old puppy, which became aggressive
and behaved strangely. The mother of the children then took them to
Cochabamba [city], and they were attended to in the Viedma Hospital,
where they received vaccine and anti-rabies immunoglobulin and are in
treatment and follow up," Vallejos added.

According to Vallejos, the main cause of rabies in pets is the
proliferation of animals in streets and plazas, where trash cans
become improvised homes for wandering dogs that do not have the
necessary vaccinations. The greater part of the populace has more than
one pet at home and sometimes are unconcerned about the care that
their pet needs.

"In Cochabamba, despite the rabies vaccination campaigns that we have
carried out, people have dogs and raise them without control. The
latest human rabies case is due to a puppy, and in the case of the
Independence [community], there was another [rabid] puppy bought from
a field [vendor]."

The Municipal Council is working on writing new ordinances that will
regulate the sale and keeping of animals, establishing sanctions and
parameters for raising domestic animals.

"We are awaiting the new ordinance approval with its 50 articles; no
one will be able to say that they did not know what is required, not
the vendors nor the populace. Nobody can have a dog without committing
to its care, feeding, and giving it affection," said council member
Ninoska Lazarte.

According to data from SEDES, every year, rabies vaccination campaigns
have been programmed in the entire department. On Sunday [2 Oct 2011],
around 250 000 domestic animals were immunized against the virus; even
during the course of the year, the populace can vaccinate their pets
without cost in health centers.

"When rabies virus enters the nervous system of a person, then nothing
can be done. A patient can still save themselves if they receive
vaccine in time: immediately. What has to be done if there is a dog
bite is to wash out the bite wound with plenty of water and soap,
notify parents [in the case of children], identify the animal so that
it can be put under observation [in quarantine] and, most importantly,
go to the physician to receive [anti-rabies post-exposure] treatment,"
explained the director, Guido Sanchez.

[This report is a continuation of the 13 Oct 2011 ProMED-mail post
(archive 20111013.3064), with more details and information about the
development of new regulations. The fatal case [7 year old girl] is
the same case as reported before.

Maintaining a high degree of rabies immunity in a large, ever-changing
un-owned population of street dogs is difficult. A
vaccination/neutering program may help to stabilize the population and
maintain a higher level of herd immunity. More frequent vaccination
campaigns may be necessary in Cochabamba department. One hopes that
the new ordinances in Cochabamba will also be helpful but these will
require public education and enforcement to be effective.

In the past 6 months, rabies has been a significant problem in other
departments in Bolivia as well. Canine rabies cases have also been
reported in Oruro, La Paz, and Santa Cruz departments this year
(2011).
