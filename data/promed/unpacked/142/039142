2000/152 Details on the occurrence of beet necrotic yellow vein benyvirus
in Sweden [edited.
----------------------------------------
As reported in EPPO RS 2000/058, beet necrotic yellow vein benyvirus
(BNYVV-EPPO A2 quarantine pest) now occurs in Sweden. Surveys on
rhizomania and _Polymyxa_-transmitted sugar beet viruses have been carried
out since 1986. [Testing of soil and sugar beet root samples showed that
both _Polymyxa betae_ and beet soil-borne furovirus are widespread in sugar
beet-growing areas. The occurrence of BNYVV in Sweden was confirmed in
1997. Molecular studies [showed that there are 2 major strain groups of
BNYVV in Europe (A and B types). The A type is widespread in southern
Europe and also in the Netherlands, whereas the B type is prevalent in
Germany and France. The virus was detected in 2 small areas, one on the
island of Oland [A type and one in the south-eastern part of Scania [B
type. In UK, both types [are present and cases of mixed infections have
been reported. [The authors suggest that BNYVV may [have been introduced
into Sweden [from at least 2 different sources.

[According to the authors, the A- and B- [types of BNYVV differ by [about
5% of the nucleotides in their RNAs. The B-type occurs mainly in France
and Germany, and in some places in Sweden, Poland, and Hungry and
Britain. The A-type is found in Southern Europe (Italy, Spain, former
Yugoslavia) and Eastern Europe and neighbouring areas (parts of Sweden,
Poland, [Ukraine, Iran) but also in the Netherlands.
New information provided by Renate Koenig shows that the P-type is more
similar to the A-[type than to the B-type [at the molecular level. It
seems to be the most aggressive one, possibly due to the fact that it is
associated with a fifth RNA species. [Surprisingly the P-type is found in
a small area near in France [near Pithiviers, but not in any other
sugar-beet production area in Europe, and in [Kazakhstan, approximately
4000 km east. A reference to this work is the following: R. Koenig & B.-L.

necrotic yellow vein virus and detection of the rare P type in
