Health authorities say there is no link between a patient who was seen at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) for listeriosis and the consumption of contaminated rockmelons from Australia, according to preliminary investigations.

The Ministry of Health (MOH) told The Straits Times on Friday [9 Mar 2018] that there is still no report of anyone here having contracted the bacterial disease as a result of eating the rockmelons, which have made 17 people ill in Australia and killed 4. All rockmelons from Australia are in the process of being recalled by authorities.

The ministry said it was notified by SGH of a case of listeriosis on Tue 6 Mar 2018. Further tests are ongoing to determine the source of infection.

A WhatsApp message that circulated on Friday [9 Mar 2018] claimed that someone who ate rockmelons from Sheng Siong[*] ended up as the "first case of listeria in SGH."

The outbreak in Australia is linked to contaminated rockmelons from a farm in New South Wales. Consignments of melons from the farm were found to have been exported to Singapore.

There is an incubation period of between 3 and 70 days after consuming _Listeria_-contaminated food. Consumers should seek medical attention as early as possible if they develop fever and muscle aches that are preceded by diarrhoea or other gastrointestinal symptoms appearing within 70 days of eating Australian rockmelon, the ministry said.

Doctors have been asked to refer suspected cases of listeriosis for testing and treatment and to notify MOH of suspected cases. "We will continue to monitor the situation closely," said the MOH spokesman.

The Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) on Thursday [8 Mar 2018] announced a recall of all rockmelons [cantaloupes] from Australia as a "precautionary measure." This is because it received new information from Australian authorities indicating that more _Listeria_-affected consignments had been exported to Singapore.

The _Listeria_ outbreak has so far been traced to a specific grower in the state of New South Wales. AVA had a few days ago recalled 2 consignments of rockmelon from this grower. Rockmelons from those 2 consignments were sold at Sheng Siong[*] stores and wet markets between 12 Feb and 2 Mar 2018. "We expanded the recall to include all rockmelons from Australia immediately after receiving the latest updates from the Australian authorities," said AVA in a media release.

"The Australian authorities confirmed that the farm had stopped production on 23 Feb [2018] and that there are no other affected farms in Australia. AVA will continue to work with the Australian authorities on this matter."

In Australia, 4 people have died, and 13 others fell ill after consuming melon contaminated with _Listeria_. Singapore authorities said that to date, there have been no such cases reported here.

"We had earlier taken samples of locally sold rockmelons for food safety tests, including testing for _Listeria_. The results are pending," added AVA.

It also advised food retail establishments to temporarily stop selling rockmelons from Australia as well as to stop using them in dishes immediately until further notice. "If retailers are unsure of the source of their rockmelons, they should also stop the sale or use of such rockmelons as a precaution," said the authority.

Consumers who have bought rockmelons from Australia -- or who are unsure where the rockmelons they bought come from -- are advised not to eat them, AVA added. Those who do not feel well after consuming rockmelon should seek medical attention.

_Listeria_ is a bacterium that causes listeriosis, a form of food poisoning that is treatable with antibiotics if diagnosed early. Symptoms include fever and muscle aches, preceded by diarrhoea or other gastrointestinal symptoms that appear within 70 days after consumption of the contaminated food item.

[Sheng Siong is the 3rd largest chain of supermarkets in Singapore (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheng_Siong).

A report mistakenly said that listeriosis in a hospitalized patient at Singapore General Hospital was linked to eating a melon, but the melon was called a Hami melon, which is a type of muskmelon, originally from Hami, Xinjiang, China. This report was in Chinese and machine translated (https://www.channel8news.sg/news8/singapore/2080309-sg-sgh-listeria/3977428.html). Pictures of Hami melons are available at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hami_melon.

Singapore recalled all rockmelons [cantaloupes] imported from Australia as a "precautionary measure" several days ago in response to the outbreak in Australia that had been traced to a specific grower in the Australian state of New South Wales, No cases of listeriosis have been linked to consumption of Australian rockmelons in Singapore.
