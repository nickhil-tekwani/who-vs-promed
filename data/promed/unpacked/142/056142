[This is the 2nd part of the daily update following the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on selected countries of interest. To reduce the size of these posts, there will be changes over the coming days. The tables will be reduced but are available at the source URLs and will be referred to in the summaries of daily changes for each country. Countries that have almost interrupted transmission and have been lifting restrictions (China, South Korea) and have lessons to learn as they attempt to prevent explosive 2nd waves will continue to be profiled. We will attempt to select countries from each region on a daily basis. - Mod.UBA]

[According to the report above, in the past 24 hours, there have been 28 newly confirmed cases in China, 4 of which were imported and 24 acquired locally (21 in Beijing municipality, 2 in Hebei province and 1 in Tianjin municipality). No new deaths were reported. 8 new cases were reported in Hong Kong. A total of 1860 imported cases have been reported. There have been no new deaths reported for several weeks, which may change with the significant increase in newly reported cases.

There were 8 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic individuals in the past 24 hours; 2 were imported. There were no cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The recent previous reports of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic were on 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 13 Jun 2020, when 1 conversion was reported each time and 2 cases were reported on 14 Jun 2020. Prior to that, there were 2 cases on 1 Jun 2020, and a single case was reported on 18 May 2020 (COVID-19 update (194): China, S Korea, countries w/ high local trans, Italy phase 2 20200519.7352327).

[In the past 24 hours, according to the report at the source URL, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 59 cases and 1 new death, compared with 43 cases and 1 new death during the previous day (16 Jun 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 70 consecutive days. Today's (17 Jun 2020) breakdown of cases: 51 cases were locally transmitted, and 8 were imported cases. Locally acquired cases were in Seoul (24), Gyeonggi (15), Daejeon (7), Chungnam (3), Jeonbuk (1) and Sejong (1). Imported cases were in quarantine (4), 1 each in Gyeonggi, Seoul, Incheon, and Daegu. Note that 9 provinces did not report any newly confirmed cases.

The impression (hasn't changed): Lifting of measures has been accompanied by increases in locally acquired infections through increasing clusters related to gatherings of people at employment (bringing it outside employment to contacts) and in houses of worship, and bars and clubs. It just takes one super-spreader in a crowded place to transmit and lead to a sizeable cluster.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 237 828 cases, including 34 448 deaths, up by 329 cases and 43 deaths in the past 24 hours. The previous day's (16 Jun 2020) 24-hour change was 210 cases and 34 deaths. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are still in decline. As it has been, the major increase in cases was in Lombardy, reporting 210 newly confirmed cases.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in Lombardy, the original epicenter of the outbreak, (see tables at http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_notizie_4903_0_file.pdf and http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_notizie_4903_1_file.pdf). Lombardy again reported the largest number of newly confirmed cases in the 24-hour period (242) and was the only province reporting more than 50 new cases. Also, 17 provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (6 provinces reported no new cases), with only 3 other provinces reporting 10 or more but fewer than 50 newly confirmed cases (Piedmont, 41 cases, Emilia-Romagna, 14 cases, and Lazio, 10 cases).

The top 5 provinces by cumulative case count remain unchanged and are Lombardy, followed by Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Tuscany.

Italy is now 44 days post phase 2 initial opening up and 28 days post 2nd stage of phase 2 opening up.

[4] Iran: 195 051 total cases, 9185 deaths

As many as 2612 people have been infected with the coronavirus (COVID-19) in the past 24 hours in Iran, said Sima Sadat Lari, spokesperson for Iran's Ministry of Health and Medical Education, Trend reports citing the ministry.

According to Sadat Lari, 120 more people have died from the coronavirus over the past day. Sadat Lari added that the condition of 2789 people is critical, and said that the situation is more dangerous in Iran's Khuzestan, East Azerbaijan, Kermanshah, Hormozgan, Kurdistan, and Razavi Khorasan provinces.

So far, more than 1.31 million tests have been conducted in Iran for the diagnosis of coronavirus. Iran continues to monitor the coronavirus situation in the country. According to recent reports from the Iranian officials, over 195 000 people have been infected 9185 people have already died. Meanwhile, over 154 800 have reportedly recovered from the disease.

The country continues to apply strict measures to contain the further spread. Reportedly, the disease was brought to Iran by a businessman from Iran's Qom city, who went on a business trip to China, despite official warnings. The man died later from the disease.

The Islamic Republic announced its 1st infections and deaths from the coronavirus on [19 Feb 2020]. The outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan -- which is an international transport hub -- began at a fish market in late December 2019. The World Health Organization (WHO) on [11 Mar 2020] declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Some sources claim the coronavirus outbreak started as early as November 2019.

[As of 17 Jun 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran is 195 051, including 9185 deaths, an increase of 2612 cases and 120 deaths since 16 Jun 2020.

Iran has started relaxing restrictions on a more widespread basis in the country. As stated previously, with the increasing daily case reports having overtaken the prior peak in late March-early April 2020, it is clear that there is now a 2nd wave, most likely due to the lifting of restrictions too early. As observed during the course of this pandemic, the increase in cases preceded the increase in deaths by about 2 weeks. That being said, the major increase in cases was seen in Iran about 4-6 weeks after the lifting of restrictions. Iran is not alone in this observation/occurrence; it is being seen in other countries/provinces/states where restrictions were lifted while major active transmission was continuing. This is a tenacious virus, and the overwhelming majority of the world is still susceptible to it ...

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 2 234 471, including 119 941 deaths, an increase from 2 208 400 cases and 119 132 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York City had a cumulative total of 207 821 as of 13:00 EDT (GMT-4) on 17 Jun 2020 including 17 487 confirmed deaths and an additional 4684 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

The top 10 states in terms of daily reported cases in descending order are California, Texas, Florida, Arizona, North Carolina, Georgia, Louisiana, New York, Maryland, and Illinois.

In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by New Jersey, California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Texas, Pennsylvania, Florida, Michigan, and Maryland, unchanged from yesterday (16 Jun 2020). California, Texas, and Florida have high daily newly confirmed cases and may well change the ordering of this list over the coming week or so. A total of 38 states and entities have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html) has data on cases, hospitalization, testing, and epidemiologic variables such as age, race, ILI (influenza-like illness), surveillance, and emergency room visits, definitely worth reviewing, a welcome series of analyses.
