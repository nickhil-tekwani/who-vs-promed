A total of 30 university students who were allegedly poisoned by the food they ate in Konya were taken to hospitals. Some of the students who ate at the KTO Karatay University cafeteria in the central Karatay district, Akabe District, complained of nausea and dizziness. Thereupon, university officials asked for help from the 112 Emergency Service team. It was learned that 30 students, who were taken to hospitals with the suspicion of food poisoning, were in good health.

In the statement made by KTO Karatay University, "It was seen that some people were affected due to a meal in our university cafeteria, and medical attention was given quickly. It is important that our students and valuable educators who feel unwell because of the food they consume in our university cafeteria contact us quickly."

It was learned that the number of those who applied to the hospital was around 250.

[ProMED thanks Mahmoud Orabi for these submissions.

Although one of the 2 reports mentioned liver as a possible source of this outbreak, which presented with fever, nausea and vomiting, it is
not stated how long after the meal (the incubation period) the symptoms began. Foodborne illnesses with primarily nausea and vomiting tend to occur without fever (i.e., staphylococcal enterotoxin induced). ProMED would appreciated more information about this outbreak.

The city of Konya is the capital of Konya Province in southwest-central Anatolia. - Mod.LL
