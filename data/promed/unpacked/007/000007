results. The National Veterinary Research and Quarantine Service

The initial negative results of the "penside test" (details will be
helpful) underlines the maintained importance of traditional
diagnostic procedures. The efficiency of the South Korean State
Veterinary Services obtaining an early diagnosis is commendable. It
remains to be seen if no animal movements or other contacts with
other animal holdings had taken place since mid December 2009, which
may have led to spread elsewhere.

South Korea had experienced its previous FMD outbreak in 2002, caused
by the virus serotype Middle East-Southern Asian (ME-SA) topotype of
FMDV-O, which spread during those years throughout 2 continents.

In North Korea, an FMD outbreak was recognised in January [2007] and
reported as due to serotype O.

Serotyping of the current isolate is anticipated the soonest; this
will, hopefully, enable identifying its source. - Mod.AS]
