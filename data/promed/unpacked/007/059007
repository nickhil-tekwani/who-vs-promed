Description of affected population: a 7-year-old ewe kept with other
adult ewes in a ewe 'corp'' ready for lambing, which starts in
October 2005. All lambing occurs outside in lambing paddocks. The
affected animal was homebred. The farm is a family farm of 4705 hectares.
The sheep was discovered by the owner of the premises and a staff
member of the Department of Agriculture while [they were] driving
through the property. Whereas all the other sheep ran away from the
vehicle, this animal stood still and appeared to be unaware of the
vehicle's presence. It was in very poor body condition and was
constantly nibbling at its feet. It was imminently due to lamb, but
at post-mortem the lamb was poorly developed. Lungs were collapsed --
looked like pneumonia.
Diagnosis: atypical case.

Laboratories Agency (VLA), Weybridge, United Kingdom (OIE Reference
Laboratory for scrapie)

Date: 1 Nov 2005

Diagnostic tests used: immunostaining for PrP using VLA monoclonal
antibody R145 at 1:500
Date: 1 Nov 2005
Results: positive
Source of outbreak or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive.
Final report: yes.

[For more information on atypical Scrapie, see comments of Mod.TG in
Scrapie, atypical, ovine - Falkland Islands 20051120.3371, referenced
below. The inclusion of bovines in this report is because they are on
the farm, I assume. Sheep and goats are susceptible to scrapie,
while cattle are not. - Mod.PC]
