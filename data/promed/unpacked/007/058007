Animal health officials in Ivory Coast reported highly pathogenic H5N1 avian flu outbreaks in poultry, according to the latest notifications from the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE).

Ivory Coast reported 2 separate events, both linked to the introduction of new poultry into flocks. One of the outbreaks began on 10 Nov 2021 at a layer farm in Grand-Bassam [Como√© district], about 25 miles [about 40 km] east of Abidjan. The virus killed 174 of 11 000 susceptible birds.

The other event started on 21 Nov 2021 at a poultry breeding farm in Abidjan, killing 5000 of 32 000 susceptible birds.
