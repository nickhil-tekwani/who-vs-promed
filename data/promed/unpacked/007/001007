Brazil confirmed 846 cases and 260 deaths for the period 1 Jul 2017 - 6 Mar of this year [2018]. During the same period last year there were 597 confirmed cases and 190 deaths.

This [Wed 7 Mar 2018] the Ministry of Health updated the information sent in by the state secretariats of health about the yellow fever situation in the country. During the monitoring period [1 Jul 2017 to 6 Mar 2018] there were 846 confirmed cases of yellow fever in the country that led to 260 deaths. In total, during this period there were 3234 reported suspected cases, of which 1560 were discarded and 828 remain under investigation.

Last year from [1 Jul 2016 to 28 Feb 2017], there were there were 597 confirmed cases and 190 confirmed deaths. These reports of yellow fever cases show a pattern of disease seasonality, occurring mainly in summer, with the period of analysis considered to be [1 Jul-30 Jun] of each year.

Although the number of cases of the current monitoring period have been higher than during the previous season, yellow fever today circulates in metropolitan regions of the country that have the greatest contingent of the population, hitting 32.5 million, including people who live in areas that never had recommendations for [yellow fever] vaccination. In the past season, for example, the outbreak hit a population [at risk] of 8.4 million people. This explains why the incidence of the disease in this period is lower than in the past period. The incidence of the disease in the monitoring period until [6 Mar 2018] is 2.4 cases for 100 000 inhabitants. In the past season, 2016/2017, the incidence was 7/100 000 inhabitants, in the same period [but with a smaller population at risk].

Campaign
--------
To increase vaccine coverage, the states of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo decided to continue the strategy of vaccination of the population. This effort counts on the help of the Ministry of Health. Preliminary data from the Secretariats of Health of the states of Bahia, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo to the Ministry of Health indicates that as of [6 Mar 2018], 17.3 million people were vaccinated, including cumulative numbers of the public vaccinated in the municipalities. The number corresponds to 76 percent of the number targeted for the campaign. The Ministry of Health emphasizes the importance of vaccinating the population in the states of Rio de Janeiro, Bahia and São Paulo during the campaign against yellow fever. According to the data sent in to the Ministry of Health by the states, as of [6 Mar 2018] 8.4 million people (90 percent) were vaccinated in Sao Paulo and 7.1 million (71.5 percent) in Rio de Janeiro. Currently in the state of Bahia, 1.8 million people were vaccinated for a total of 55 percent of the targeted public.

[Cases of yellow fever (YF) continue to increase, albeit slowly. The YF vaccination campaign has been catching up quickly to the targeted coverage. The above report provides a good update on the current yellow fever (YF) situation in Brazil. There is no indication that the outbreak has ended. Although there have been no reports of cases from the urban, _Aedes aegypti_, cycle of transmission the risk remains that spill-over from the sylvan (forest) cycle could occur. _Aedes aegypti_ vector mosquitoes are present in the area and responsible for the transmission of dengue, Zika and chikungunya viruses. It is important to note that cases of YF in humans and monkeys are occurring in areas outside of the 3 states where the outbreak is occurring. There is risk of new human cases and outbreaks in other areas, so that surveillance in a broad area of Brazil is important.

The Pedro de Toledo municipal administration in the Vale do Ribeira region, in the interior of Sao Paulo [state] , confirmed on this [Fri 2 Mar 2018]) the presence of yellow fever virus in a monkey that was found dead in the limits with the city of Iguape. Residents of nearby regions have to be vaccinated against this expected disease.

According to the issued information, the monkey was found in the Despraiado neighborhood. Given its proximity to the neighboring city, a team from the Pedro de Toledo government collected it to carry out tests. The result came out this week and confirmed the presence of the virus in the animal, whose species was not given.

Both municipalities declared special attention to the locality. Residents of the area who have not been vaccinated are targets of a task force for immunization to occur. According to information from the Health agencies, there are no registered cases of yellow fever among the residents of the 2 cities.

[This was predictable. After identifying circulation of yellow fever virus in the Baixada Santista, it is more than expected that the virus spread not by the green corridors, but by the "green avenue" that is the Atlantic Forest to the Ribeira Valley. The identification of the virus in the Ribeira Valley ratifies the importance (necessity) of the expansion of the vaccination recommendation areas in the state of São Paulo. A previous 2018 post stated, "As important as the increasing number of confirmed cases (and deaths) of yellow fever in the state of São Paulo is the apparent progressive expansion of virus (and transmission) circulation to different areas of the state including the coastal regions. The current scenario further ratifies not only the importance of intensifying vaccination strategies in areas where the recommendation is already in force but the need to plan the rapid incorporation of the recommendation for yellow fever vaccination in every state."

The Ribeira Valley is a region located in the south of the state of São Paulo and in the eastern state of Paraná, Brazil. It is named after the river basin of the Ribeira de Iguape River and the Lagunar Estuary of Iguape, Cananeia and Paranaguá. Its area of 2 830 666 hectares [1092926 sq mi] is home to a population of 481 224 inhabitants and fully includes the area of 31 municipalities (9 from Paraná and 22 from São Paulo). There are also 21 other municipalities in the state of Paraná and another 18 municipalities in the state of São Paulo, which are partially included in the Ribeira basin. It houses 61 percent of the Atlantic Forest remaining in Brazil, 150 000 hectares [57 915 sq mi] of restinga [coastal tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forest] and 17 000 [6563 sq mi] of mangroves (Source: https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vale_do_Ribeira. - Mod.RNA

This case of YF in a dead monkey in a new locality underscores the importance of local surveillance support by rapid laboratory-based diagnosis as a basis for focused vaccination efforts. - Mod.TY]
