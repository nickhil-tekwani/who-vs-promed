The CSS laboratory that produces medicines counts on operation permits, but
none of the 24 types of remedies that were manufactured have sanitary
registry. According to the explanation given, the law does not demand that
they have the sanitary registry. Physician and pharmacy professional
associations have placed the quality of medicine production of CSS under a
magnifying glass and the controls enforced by pharmacies and drugs of the
Ministry of Health. An administrative and penal investigation begins.
Another 10 persons were added to the list of those affected by the acute
renal insufficiency syndrome (SIRA). This brings to 44 the total of
reported cases.
In the meantime, another 7 persons are under observation as "suspected
cases" according to the last report of the Ministry of Health (MINSA)
released yesterday. This syndrome has already caused 21 deaths.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States (CDC),
found a compound in an expectorant syrup without sugar that should not be
there: diethylene glycol, used as a cooling product in the automotive
industry [antifreeze].
As a result of this finding, the MINSA ordered a recall of 7 of the 24
medicines produced by the laboratory of the Social Security Agency (CSS),
all of which were used to alleviate symptoms of the common cold and/or
influenza.
A product with the name and almost similar texture -- propylene glycol --
is used in the pharmaceutical, food and cosmetic industries, and is known
by the Agency of Toxic Substances and Registry of Diseases of the
Department of Health of the United States as a "generally innocuous" additive.
The function of propylene glycol is to absorb excess water and maintain the
moisture content of the products.
The authorities now base their hopes on the antidote fomepizole, which
arrived in the country yesterday and was used immediately in patients who
remain hospitalized in the Arnulfo Arias Madrid Hospital Complex of the CSS.
The national director of the Medication Commission, Marcos Llerena,
indicated that the laboratories of the organization relies on operating
permits from the Direction of Pharmacies and Drugs of the Ministry of
Health in order to make the medicines, but none of the drugs has a sanitary
registry.
The director of CSS, Rene Luciani, explained that there are a series of
analyses performed on the medications in order to guarantee their quality,
"but unfortunately in this case they did not detect the toxic substance".
Luciani assured that at the present time, the CSS, the Department of
Pharmacies and Drugs of the Ministry of Health, and the Public Ministry are
trying to determine if the presence of diethylene glycol in the expectorant
syrup without sugar produced by the institution [CSS] was an "intentional
malicious act", a human error or an adulterated product at the time of
production. "All the possibilities are being examined", he stated.
The hypothesis of a human error "is one of the possibilities, we are
studying all of the raw materials and the final products, the sites and
locations where they were put together and the process of the production
line", he assured.
Once it was known there was the presence of this substance [diethylene
glycol] in the medicines, the Directorate of Pharmacies and Drugs assumed
control over the case investigation and has sole access to the investigators.
During the conference, Luciani explained that the facility where the
medicines are produced operates a press, some transport offices, and others
who care for HIV patients who are on triple therapy.
The director of the CSS specified that as a result of this incident, he
will conduct a cost-benefit evaluation to determine if the laboratories
should be closed and in its place, to purchase these medications from
external suppliers.
Since 1969, the CSS has been producing medicines. At present there are 24
types of medicines produced, of which at least 9 are syrups.
Information given by the CSS states that every month the institution
dispatches 10 000 bottles of the expectorant [that was contaminated] and in
May of this year [2006] it made 100 thousand units of the same [medication].
Directives from the CSS detailed the shipments from the months of June,
July and August [2006] to the Juan Diaz polyclinic, where they received 142
boxes, each [box] containing 48 bottles, and of the San Miguelito
polyclinic where there were 159 boxes distributed. They did not give other
details and they explained that at present there is an inventory underway
to see which pharmacies were sent the products, how much was delivered and
how many remain in the institutions.
Medications that leave the CSS laboratory, according to Luciani and his
team, do not have sanitary registries as required for private laboratories.
The pharmacological production practices determine that before a medicine
is dispatched it must pass through a series of tests to confirm that
everything is in order. The verifications begin from the moment the raw
material is received until it is combined with other compounds to
individually package [the product].
Luciani has said that they are "studying all the raw material and the final
products, the sites and places where they are gathered together and the
production lines."
At this time, the importation and production of medicines is based on Law 1
of 10 Jan 2001. According to the ex-director of the CSS, Marianella
Morales, the State demands that private laboratories have production
permits and sanitary registries whereas the CSS laboratory is only required
to have a permit. "One never thought that medicines from the CSS required a
certificate of sanitary registry", he stated.
This same observation was also made by the National Association of
Physicians and Dentists of the CSS, which pointed out that the Directorate
of Pharmacies and Drugs of the Ministry of Health had not given sufficient
supervision over the production of medicines in the country. In addition,
the National College of Pharmacists said that if there was good supervision
over quality control in the laboratory, and Pharmacies and Drugs oversaw
that there were good manufacturing practices, there would not have been a
problem.
At the beginning of the 1960s, in the Amador Guerrero de Colon Hospital
something strange occurred. People who entered walking and with symptoms of
a common cold ended up hospitalized and with renal problems. There were at
least 15 deaths.
In the analyses conducted at that time, it was found that they had ingested
some type of glycol, and the measure taken at that time was to suspend the
prescriptions of syrups that contained this product.

Quality control of medicine production in the Social Security Agency (CSS)
is in doubt. The director of Medical benefits, Rosario Turner, admitted
that the drugs produced by CSS do not have sanitary registries even though
the laboratory does operate with the permission of the Directorate of
Pharmacies and Drugs of the Ministry of Health.
Gustavo Arosemena, from the Specialized Institute of Analyses (IEA) of the
University of Panama, said yesterday that since 2002, the IEA has not
inspected medicines coming from the CSS. In addition, The Association of
Physicians, dentists and Related Professions of the CSS stated that in
Panama medicines are being administered without adequate quality control.
For its part, the National College of Pharmacists asked that the
authorities clearly state how many persons of the persons who died had
taken lisinopril or the altered syrup.
Yesterday, 10 new cases were identified, and the Public Ministry inspected
the production laboratory of the CSS that is now under the charge of the
[Directorate] of Pharmacies and Drugs [in the Ministry of Health].

[It now appears as though contamination/adulteration of an expectorant
syrup with diethylene glycol is considered the definitive etiology of the
"acute syndrome of unexpected renal insufficiency" in Panama. The present
case count is 44 with 21 associated deaths. From the background information
in the newswire [1], it appears as though there had been a similar
occurrence in the early 1960s, with about 15 reported deaths. There is
still insufficient evidence to determine whether this was an intentional
poisoning, or an accidental poisoning either due to incorrect product
labeling or incorrect product use in the production of the implicated syrup.
Of interest, Dr Monir Taha, associate medical officer of health, Halton
Region Health Department, Ontario Canada <Monir.Taha@halton.ca> provided a
very relevant reference (see ref 1). In this occurrence, there was an
outbreak of acute renal failure in children associated with diethylene
glycol (DEG) contamination of a pediatric acetaminophen product resulting
from contamination of imported glycerin used in production. Of interest, at
the time, there were 17 liquid medications that were likely to have been
contaminated with the DEG, although only the acetaminophen syrup was
epidemiologically associated with illness. The authors postulated that the
acetaminophen may have provided an "additive or potentiating effect for DEG
toxicity since both are toxic to the liver and may alter the metabolism of
DEG". Studies indicated that the concentrations of DEG in the acetaminophen
syrup were greater than in other products. Reflecting back to the current
situation in Panama, it is still unclear if other products were
contaminated by the DEG (and the MOH has withdrawn 7 products from the
market), but it does appears as though expectorant syrup without sugar is
epidemiologically linked to the cases. Outbreak reports of medications
contaminated with diethylene glycol can be found at:
