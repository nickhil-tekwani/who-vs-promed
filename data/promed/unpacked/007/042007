On 1-2 Apr 2015, a total of 16 patients from Bardibas (Mahottari district [Central Region], south-eastern Nepal), who developed sudden onset of high fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea and vomiting after consuming food at a Bratabandha party (Hindu ceremony), were admitted to Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital (STIDH), Kathmandu. Most of the patients were between 14 and 45 years old. The symptoms appeared approximately 12 to 72 hours after eating food. All patients are being treated in STIDH. It was a vegetarian party and some 150 people have attended the party. Although they (patients) said that food samples have been collected for laboratory testing, the etiology of this outbreak may not be identified, if it is of viral origin such as norovirus or adult diarrhea rotavirus (group B rotavirus), due to either lack of sophisticated laboratory or not including in the differential diagnosis, which are already known to cause food poisoning in Nepal.
