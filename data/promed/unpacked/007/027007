A posting has gone viral on Facebook. In it, a local woman claims several of her friends contracted a dangerous fungus while tubing down the Little Wolf River. Blastomycosis is a fungal infection [that] causes flu-like symptoms and respiratory issues.

[The patient] says a month ago she and a group of friends came to the Wolf River Campground in New London [Wisconsin] to go tubing. Afterwards she and 3 friends became ill, all diagnosed with the same fungal infection, blastomycosis, eventually landing her and another friend in the hospital. "It makes sense that all the people who got sick were with me at the time," said [the patient].

According to the CDC, blastomycosis [disease-causing spores] live in soil in decaying organic matter. Fungal spores become airborne when soil is disturbed, and a person becomes ill after breathing in those spores.

[The patient] recalled when she believes she was exposed: "Usually, you float down, and there is a little island you stop at; so we were climbing up, and on top, there is a bunch of wood, and it's really muddy," [the patient] said.

But at the Wolf River Campground, managers question [the patient]'s claim since no one who became ill ever contacted them. "I don't feel there is anything wrong out on the water," said Richard Flease, a campground manager. "If any health officials have anything to say about it, we'll definitely look into it. But as of now, we have not heard from anybody except from this group of 4 people."

Outagamie County's Health Department says they have one confirmed case, know of one in another county, and have alerted the state. The Waupaca County Health Department says they have no complaints.

"It really is scary; that is why I'm trying to get the word out," [the patient] explained. But at the Wolf River Campground, for now, it's business as usual. "We have lots of people out here each weekend, and I would have thought we'd have a few more reports on it," Flease said.

An infectious disease expert told Local 5 that all who became ill also work at the same business and that it's too early to say with any certainty how they contracted the illness.

[The news report above tells of 4 cases of blastomycosis that occurred among friends one month following their tubing down the Little Wolf River in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. The Wolf and Little Wolf rivers flow through the forests and farmlands of central Wisconsin in 2 adjacent counties, Waupaca and Outagamie Counties, in the north-central part of the state. A map of Wisconsin showing the location of its counties can be found at http://www.digital-topo-maps.com/county-map/wisconsin.shtml. A map showing the location of the Little Wolf River tubing campground, 6 miles west of the town of New London, can be found at https://maps.yahoo.com/directions/?lat=44.39089297895648&lon=-88.81536483764648&bb=44.42752811%2C-88.89527321%2C44.35429627%2C-88.73545647&o=Chester%2C%20PA&d=E8130%20Flease%20Rd%2C%20New%20London%2C%20WI%2054961-8021. The length of the tubing trip is either 1.5 or 4 miles down the not very rapid Little Wolf river (http://wolfrivertrips.com/river-trips/first-time-tubing-useful-info/).

Blastomycosis is a potentially fatal infection caused by the soil-based dimorphic fungus _Blastomyces dermatitidis_, which exists in the environment at ambient temperature as a mold and in the animal host at body temperature as a yeast. The fungus likely resides in moist soil with decomposing organic debris. It appears that only under quite specific conditions of humidity, temperature and nutrition can the fungus grow and produce the infecting spores. The spores become airborne when soil in which the fungus is growing is disturbed. Fungal spores may be inhaled and initiate an acute or chronic lung infection, which, if untreated, may disseminate to the skin, bone, joints, urinary tract, prostate, and brain. The incubation period can range from 3 weeks to 3 months, but many infected people remain asymptomatic.

The diagnosis of blastomycosis is based on isolation of _B. dermatitidis_ from specimens obtained from sputum, skin, or tissue biopsy (growth of organisms in cultures may take at least 4 weeks), or the demonstration of characteristic broad-based budding yeast cells by direct microscopic examination of wet unstained clinical specimens, cytology preparations, or histopathology slides. PCR-based assays may also be available to detect DNA of _B. dermatitidis_ in cultures or clinical specimens (http://jcm.asm.org/content/50/5/1783.full). The drug itraconazole is used to treat mild or moderate disease and amphotericin B is used for patients with central nervous system involvement, patients who are severely immunocompromised, or patients who do not respond to itraconazole therapy (http://www.idsociety.org/uploadedFiles/IDSA/Guidelines-Patient_Care/PDF_Library/Blastomycosis.pdf). Blastomycosis more commonly affects people involved with outdoor activities, in proximity to waterways (http://www.cdc.gov/Mmwr/PDF/wk/mm4528.pdf), and the symptoms may be more severe in people with a weakened immune system.

The infection is endemic throughout much of the Midwestern USA, including the area on both the Canadian and U.S. sides of the Great Lakes and the St Lawrence River valley. Most cases are sporadic, but cluster of cases have occurred in a close geographic area within a short period of time. Although blastomycosis is not nationally notifiable in the U.S., it is reportable in Wisconsin since 1984, following 2 outbreaks (Centers for Disease Control: Blastomycosis -- Wisconsin, 1986-1995. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 1996; 45(28): 601-3, http://www.cdc.gov/Mmwr/PDF/wk/mm4528.pdf; and Wisconsin Department of Health Services, https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/disease/blastomycosis.htm).

The Wisconsin Division of Public Health (DPH) reports that 90-100 cases of blastomycosis occur in the state annually. Although cases of blastomycosis have been reported from all areas in Wisconsin, there appears to be an increase in the number of reported cases occurring in the northern and central counties (https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/publications/p4/p42030.pdf). An outbreak, said to be the largest ever reported, occurred in Marathon County, Wisconsin during the 10-month period between September 2009 and June 2010, in which outdoor activities were not apparently a risk factor. This outbreak involved 55 people, 70 percent of whom were hospitalized, 2 (5 percent) died, and 20 (45 percent) were Hmong people (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23735332). The reasons for the large number of Hmong affected were unclear, but may have involved genetic predisposition. Marathon County is located in north-central Wisconsin, near Waupaca County, the location of the Little Wolf River, said to be the site of the current outbreak.

We are not told in the above news report whether any of the 4 patients were immunocompromised (e.g., have HIV infection or are recipients of organ transplants) or have other host characterictics that would predispose them to developing blastomycosis, and whether they were exposed to other possible environmental sources, which are usually characterized as disturbed soil that contains decomposing organic matter, common in damp wooded areas. ProMED-mail would appreciate more information in this regard from knowledgeable sources.
