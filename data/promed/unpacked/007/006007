Suspected anthrax outbreak in West Sumba results in 5 people dead.
-----------------------------------------------------
The deaths of 5 people in 2 villages in West Sumba region, East Nusa
Tenggara [Nusa Tenggara Timor], have led authorities to quarantine
both areas due to a suspected outbreak of anthrax. The residents,
from Kapaka Madeta and Kawangohari villages, died after consuming
beef at the end of last month [March 2007].
Laboratory results from Makassar, South Sulawesi [Sulawesi Selatan],
showed meat samples taken from buffaloes, horses and cows positively
infected with the _Bacillus anthracis_ bacteria, which causes anthrax.
The local administration says the outbreak in the 2 villages is an
extraordinary situation and a number of relevant agencies are making
efforts to vaccinate and treat thousands of hot-blooded animals,
including goats, pigs, sheep and deer.
Head of the Animal Health Division at the East Nusa Tenggara [Nusa
Tenggara Timor] Husbandry Office, Maria Geong, said in Kupang on
Friday [13 Apr 2007] that anthrax was a fatal disease.
"Anyone infected by the virus has little chance of surviving," she
said. "Spores which protect the bacteria probably surfaced due to
floods or the dry weather. Anthrax spores can live up to 60 years
underground," she said.
According to data at the provincial husbandry office, anthrax started
appearing on Sumba, Flores, Timor and Rote islands between 1906 and
1957, attacking hot-blooded livestock. It reoccurred in Aesesa
district, Ngada regency in 1954, causing the deaths of hundreds of
horses, goats and sheep.
The last outbreak occurred in 1987 on Sabu Island, Kupang regency,
resulting in one human death as well as the death of dozens of
animals. During that outbreak, hundreds of people also suffered from
malignant, blister-like swellings of pus.
"Data shows that 40 people in East Nusa Tenggara [Nusa Tenggara
Timor] have died of anthrax so far," Maria said. Clinically, anthrax
attacks only hot-blooded animals. Human infection occurs by direct
physical contact with an infected animal. The disease can also be
transmitted to humans by inhaling air containing the anthrax spore or
(eating meat from infected carcasses)," said Maria.
Animals suffering from the disease will have blood coming from their
mouth, nose, ears and anus. They will have a high body temperature
and difficulty breathing.

[Many thanks to Joe Dudley and A-lan Banks for submitting the same or
similar articles. The general location of the outbreaks can be seen
at: <http://www.answers.com/topic/east-nusa-tenggara>. The islands
are part of a volcanic arc, the Lesser Sundra Islands, extending from
Bali to Timor.
The case fatality rate for gastrointestinal anthrax is high according
to World Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines for the Surveillance
and Control of Anthrax in Humans and Animals, which can be seen here:
<http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/anthrax/WHO_EMC_ZDI_98_6/en/ >.
Mod.MHJ who usually handles these posting but is "off duty" presently
is a contributor to the document. It indicates that 95 percent or
more of the cases globally are cutaneous in nature. Overt
gastrointestinal and pulmonary cases of anthrax are more often fatal
as treatment is often not administered in a timely fashion.
Serological evidence does indicate recovery in some individuals.
Gastrointestinal anthrax is of two forms, intestinal and
oropharygeal. The latter can be fatal in half the cases, even with treatment.
I can only guess the term "hot blooded animals" in the article means
warm blooded mammals, of which herbivores are most susceptible. It is
true that spores are extremely long lived in soil and that outbreaks
often occurred after either rain and/or drought. The WHO surveillance
guidelines indicate further research is needed to clarify the
interaction of rain, temperature and drought in producing outbreaks of anthrax.
Finally, it appears that outbreaks such as this are relatively common
in Indonesia. Interested readers can find a discusion about
surveillance and control in a previous posting referenced below - see
