[1] Thailand - amantadine resistance

Thai bird flu strain found to be resistant to drug
-----------------------------------------------
Scientists have found that a strain of the H5N1 bird flu virus
circulating in Thailand is resistant to the flu drug amantadine, and
they called for rigorous study of H5N1 strains to better treat human victims.

While the World Health Organization has long recommended that Tamiflu
be used as the 1st line of defense against H5N1, it said last May
[2006] that a "dual therapy" combining amantadine and Tamiflu may be
considered in case of an outbreak.

Yong Poovorawan, a medical professor at Chulalongkorn University in
Bangkok, said an H5N1 strain in the central part of Thailand had
become resistant to amantadine, casting more doubt over its use to
fight the disease. "It would be very dangerous if we don't know the
sensitivity or resistance of the strain to amantadine and we use
amantadine (to treat people infected with this strain of H5N1)," Yong said.

He urged more rigorous surveillance and study. "If you follow any new
strain you will know the genetic changes, you analyze its molecular
structure, make experiments to see which drug it is sensitive to and
find out which is the best antiviral for any given strain," he said.
"It's like a jigsaw [puzzle], we have to find the pieces and see the
big picture."

Yong and his researchers came to the latest conclusion after studying
the molecular structure of the strain, which has been circulating in
Thailand, Cambodia and Viet Nam since 2004. "We need to conduct in
vitro experiments," he said, referring to experiments in a laboratory
or other controlled settings. However, he could not say how effective
a dual Tamiflu-amantadine therapy may be, as Thailand has not tried
administering such a treatment. Their findings were published in the
March 2007 issue of the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases.

There are 2 H5N1 strains circulating in Thailand, one in the
northeast and the other in the central part of the country. Yong
identified the strain in the northeast province of Nakhon Phanom as
[a] Fujian-like strain, which an international group of virologists
said in October 2006 may start another wave of H5N1 outbreaks in
poultry in Southeast Asia and Eurasia. The Fujian-like strain was 1st
isolated in China's southern Fujian province in 2005. "The Nakhon
Phanom strain is the same as the Fujian-like strain ... which is also
in (the Chinese provinces of) Anhui and Zhejiang, and Laos," Yong
said. "From its molecular structure, we would say it is sensitive to
Tamiflu and amantadine."

Although H5N1 mostly affects birds, the big concern is that it could
mutate into a disease that easily passes between people, triggering a
global pandemic. The emergence of various strains of H5N1 is a matter
of deep concern because each one may respond differently to different
antiviral drugs and vaccines. "If there are too many strains and they
are very different, we will not know the efficacy of the vaccines," Yong said.

[2] Thailand - Tamiflu use

Tamiflu given to suspected avian flu patients
-----------------------------------------------
The Director-General of the Department of Disease Control revealed
that 6 Mukdahan people who had contact with poultry that died of bird
flu have taken Tamiflu medicine for 7 consecutive days, starting from
16 Mar 2007.

The Director-General of the Department of Disease Control, Md. Thawas
Suthrajarn stated that he [had received reports of] a bird flu
outbreak in poultry in the Muang District of Mukdahan Province. The
district [had already been designated] as a red zone area. The
Savannakhet Province [of Laos], which is adjacent to Mukdahan, has
also been declared a bird flu outbreak area. The bird flu situation
in Savannakhet is likely to escalate, as the pandemic there is spread
mainly by wild birds.

The Public Health Minister has instructed Md. Panya Sonkhom, Md. Prat
Boonyawongwirote, and Md. Thawas Suthrajarn to visit residents in
Mukdahan today [20 Mar 2007] and educate them about the pandemic. Md.
Panya Sonkhom is the Prime Minister's advisor, and Md. Prat
Boonyawongwirote is the Permanent Secretary of Public Health.

[3] Japan - Prohibition of Tamiflu use
Date: Wed 21 Mar 2007

Japanese doctors censured concerning Tamiflu use
-----------------------------------------------
Japanese doctors were warned on Wed 21 Mar 2007 against prescribing
Tamiflu -- one of the few medicines believed effective against bird
flu -- to teenagers, after several young patients reportedly
exhibited dangerous behavior. But the maker of the drug insisted it was safe.

The Health Ministry issued emergency instructions on Tue 20 Mar 2007
to a Japanese Tamiflu distributor, Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., to warn
doctors not to give the drug to teenagers, a Chugai official said on
condition of anonymity, citing policy.

Chugai began warning doctors, hospitals and pharmacies nationwide on
Wednesday [21 Mar 2007], the official said. Concerns over the effects
of Tamiflu, an anti-flu drug also known as oseltamivir, have spiked
in Japan after a boy and a girl, both 14, fell to their deaths from
their condominiums while taking the drug in separate incidents in
February 2007.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said it had received more
than 100 reports of delirium, hallucinations and other unusual
psychiatric behavior, mostly in Japanese children treated with
Tamiflu, between 29 Aug 2005 and 6 Jul 2006. The Japanese government
has not released detailed figures. The drug, manufactured by the
Swiss company Roche Holding AG, already carries warnings in Japan and
the United States that such abnormal behavior could occur.

Two 12-year-old boys also taking Tamiflu both broke legs after
jumping out of their houses in separate incidents in February and
March 2007, the Chugai official said. However, Roche announced on Tue
20 Mar 2007 that new data from Japan and the U.S. showed no causal
link between Tamiflu and neuropsychiatric symptoms. "We don't
understand the rationale for these actions undertaken by the Japanese
government," a Roche spokeswoman, Martina Rupp, told The Associated
Press. "No causal relationship has been established between Tamiflu
and these reports, and we don't see this as an appropriate course of
action." Rupp said the new data showed that psychiatric symptoms are
lower in influenza patients treated with Tamiflu than in patients who
haven't received the drug. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and
Roche have also said that severe cases of flu can trigger the
abnormal behavior displayed by some patients.

Tamiflu [has been] widely used in Japan to treat influenza.

[These disparate reports highlight perceived risks associated with
indiscriminate prescription of 2 of the 3 antiviral drugs known to be
active against influenza viruses. In Thailand, amantadine-resistant
virus continues to circulate and reduces treatment options, and the
anti-neuraminidase drug Tamiflu is being used to protect presumed
contacts of avian influenza patients thereby risking selection of
resistant virus and further reducing treatment options in the event
of appearance of a novel pandemic virus. In this respect, the
prohibition of Tamiflu prescription in Japan can only be beneficial.
The anti-neuraminidase drugs, Tamiflu and Relenza, remain the
antivirals of choice, especially as neuropsychiatric symptoms can no
longer be attributed to the use of Tamiflu in treatment of influenza. - Mod.CP]
