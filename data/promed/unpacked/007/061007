----------------------------------------------------------------------
Please correct the wrong information published [in the post referenced above] regarding a suspected outbreak of infectious pancreatic necrosis at a Marine harvest fish farm in the municipality of Flatanger in Nord Troendelag.

The correct information should be suspicion of an outbreak of salmonid alphavirus 2 (SAV), commonly referred to as pancreatic disease (PD) in Norway.

[I apologize for mistakenly attributing this suspicion to infectious pancreatic necrosis (IPN). Thanks to Dr Halldorsdottir for pointing this out. Dr Leo Foyle also sent a correction message.

IPN is caused by an aquabirnavirus and salmon pancreas disease (PD) by the salmonid alphavirus 2 (SAV). While the disease caused by the former also affects the pancreas, SAV also causes pathological lesions in the heart and skeletal muscle.

PD was first described in farmed Atlantic salmon in Scotland in 1976. SAV was first isolated from Atlantic salmon in Ireland and shown experimentally to induce PD in 1995.

In western Norway, serious outbreaks of PD have been diagnosed in Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout in seawater fish farms yearly since 1995, and the affected area has been expanding north- and southward since 2003. - Mod.PMB
