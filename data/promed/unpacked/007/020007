More than 400 people in northern India have died in the past month
from encephalitis, a rare condition that causes inflammation of the
brain, government officials said on Wednesday [5 Oct 2011].
Encephalitis is most often caused by a viral infection from eating or
drinking contaminated food or water, from mosquito or other insect
bites, or through breathing in respiratory droplets from an infected
person. Around 347 people have died in the Indian state of Uttar
Pradesh, while 54 children have died in the neighbouring state of
Bihar. Over 2000 cases have been reported in the last 3 months.

"Acute encephalitis syndrome has 2 types of infections -- Japanese
encephalitis [virus], which occurs due to mosquitoes, and enteroviral
encephalitis, which is caused due to unsafe drinking water," said
Dinesh Kumar Srivastava from the Community Medicine Department in
Uttar Pradesh's Gorakhpur district, where patients are receiving
treatment.

Officials said the main areas where the outbreak of the virus has been
noticed have been poor, flood-hit areas of the region, where this
year's [2011] monsoons have left pools of stagnant water that have
allowed mosquitoes to breed and infect villagers. The floods have also
led to the contamination of clean water sources such as wells, leaving
many people with no option but to use the same dirty water for both
drinking and sanitation. The infection spreads every year in
impoverished parts of Uttar Pradesh during the monsoon season,
resulting in hundreds of deaths.

According to the World Health Organisation, viral encephalitis causes
high fever, headache, stiff neck and back, vomiting, confusion and, in
severe cases, seizures, paralysis, and coma. Infants and elderly
people are particularly at risk of severe illness.

Officials say the government has earmarked 22 million rupees (USD 450
000) to tackle problems like the unavailability of clean drinking
water, lack of sanitation, and water logging, to prevent the virus
from spreading. But local aid workers say efforts need to be stepped
up. "The infection started in the early 1970s and since then it has
become an annual feature. The government is adopting short term
measures to deal with the infection instead of making any long term
plan to get rid of the virus," said Sanjay Kumar Srivastava from
Action for Peace, Prosperity and Liberty (APPL), a charity doing
research on the disease. "Besides, no preventive measures are taken to
stop the outbreak," he added, suggesting that vaccinations be more
readily available to adults as well as to children.

[Previous reports of unspecified acute encephalitis syndrome
implicated contaminated water as a source of the infectious agent,
suggesting, without stating, that enteroviruses might be involved. The
report above states that enteroviruses are involved, but does not
indicate which ones are responsible for the encephalitis cases that
are occurring. At least, this points to the source of the problem and
suggests preventive measures that might be taken. There is no
indication that a vaccination campaign for Japanese encephalitis is
being planned.
