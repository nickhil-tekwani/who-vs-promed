All oyster farms in Katama Bay were ordered shut on Mon 9 Sep 2013 by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) because of bacterial contamination that has caused at least 3 confirmed cases of illness on Martha's Vineyard, according to Edgartown shellfish constable Paul Bagnall. DPH ordered a recall for all oysters shipped from Katama Bay after 1 Aug 2013.

"We recognize the impact these actions have on many of our local businesses, and we do not take them lightly," said Cheryl Bartlett, Massachusetts Commissioner of Public Health in a news release. "We will continue to partner with federal and local health officials and industry to ensure the public's health and safety."

Mr. Bagnall said he expects oyster production from 12 active farms in the bay to be curtailed for at least 4 weeks. The July through December period is the most productive and lucrative harvest time for Katama Bay oyster farmers, Mr. Bagnall said. Production approaches 5 million commercially harvested oysters annually. Mr. Bagnall said the bacteria could threaten the entire industry. "If I owned a farm, I would be really worried about 2014," he said.

Similar outbreaks have forced closure of aquaculture operations on Cape Cod, Plymouth Bay, and in Connecticut this summer [2013].

The bacterium that prompted the shutdown of Katama Bay farms is _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_. A naturally occurring bacteria that thrives when water temperatures get warmer than 81 F, it can live and reproduce in temperatures as low as 60 F, either in the ocean or in the shells of harvested oysters. The bacteria causes severe stomach distress.

In 2012, there were 9 confirmed cases of illness from _V. paramaemolyticus_ statewide, according to DPH. The illnesses prompted regulators to order a control plan for the 2013 season. The plan included earlier icing of the shellfish after harvest, among other precautions. But with 3 cases confirmed at the Martha's Vineyard Hospital in recent weeks, DPH ordered production shut down.

"If you get a confirmed case, there are probably some cases out there; either people didn't present, or didn't feel it was necessary to go to the hospital, or doctors missed it," Mr. Bagnall said.

[The following is from the CDC regarding _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ (http://www.cdc.gov/nczved/divisions/dfbmd/diseases/vibriop/.):

_V. parahaemolyticus_ is a bacterium in the same family as those that cause cholera. It lives in brackish saltwater and causes gastrointestinal illness in humans. _V. parahaemolyticus_ naturally inhabits coastal waters and is present in higher concentrations during summer; it is a halophilic, or salt-requiring organism.

When ingested, _V. parahaemolyticus_ causes watery diarrhea often with abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, fever, and chills. Usually these symptoms occur within 24 hours of ingestion. Illness is usually self-limited and lasts 3 days. Severe disease is rare and occurs more commonly in persons with weakened immune systems. _V. parahaemolyticus_ can also cause an infection of the skin when an open wound is exposed to warm seawater.

Most people become infected by eating raw or undercooked shellfish, particularly oysters. Less commonly, this organism can cause an infection in the skin when an open wound is exposed to warm seawater.

An estimated 4500 cases of _V. parahaemolyticus_ infection occur each year in the USA. However, the number of cases reported to CDC is much lower because surveillance is complicated by underreporting. Laboratories rarely use the selective medium that is necessary to identify this organism, and it is likely that many cases are undetected. To improve our ability to monitor trends, infections caused by _V. parahaemolyticus_ and other _Vibrio_ species became nationally notifiable in 2007. State health departments report cases to CDC, and these reports are summarized annually.

_Vibrio_ organisms can be isolated from cultures of stool, wound, or blood. For isolation from stool, use of a selective medium that has thiosulfate, citrate, bile salts, and sucrose (TCBS agar) is recommended. If there is clinical suspicion for infection with this organism, the microbiology laboratory should be notified so that they will perform cultures using this medium. A physician should suspect _V. parahaemolyticus_ infection if a patient has watery diarrhea and has eaten raw or undercooked seafood, especially oysters, or when a wound infection occurs after exposure to seawater.

Treatment is not necessary in most cases of _V. parahaemolyticus_ infection. There is no evidence that antibiotic treatment decreases the severity or the length of the illness. Patients should drink plenty of liquids to replace fluids lost through diarrhea. In severe or prolonged illnesses, antibiotics such as tetracycline or ciprofloxacin can be used. The choice of antibiotics should be based on antimicrobial susceptibilities of the organism.

Vibrio is a naturally occurring organism commonly found in waters where oysters are cultivated. When the appropriate conditions occur with regard to salt content and temperature, _V. parahaemolyticus_ thrives.

Most infections caused by _V. parahaemolyticus_ in the USA can be prevented by thoroughly cooking seafood, especially oysters. Wound infections can be prevented by avoiding exposure of open wounds to warm seawater. When an outbreak is traced to an oyster bed, health officials recommend closing the oyster bed until conditions are less favorable for _V. parahaemolyticus_.

Martha's Vineyard (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha's_Vineyard) is an island located south of Cape Cod in Massachusetts known for being an affluent summer colony. It includes the smaller Chappaquiddick Island, which until 2007 was part of the same land mass before becoming detached by a storm. Often called just "The Vineyard," the island has a land area of 100 square miles and is the 58th largest island in the USA and the 3rd largest on the East Coast of the USA. It is also the largest island not connected to the mainland by a bridge or tunnel on the East Coast of the USA. It is located in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as a part of Dukes County. - Mod.LL
