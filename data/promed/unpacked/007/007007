As an addendum to yesterday's posting (Smallpox outbreak, 1971 - Soviet
Union (04) 20020622.4570):
It is well documented in the literature that the hemorrhagic form of
smallpox occurred in 2-3 percent of the total cases of variola major in
Asia, and was rarely seen elsewhere (1). Dr. A. Ramachandra Rao (who
treated nearly 30 000 cases of variola major) has stated that the
hemorrhagic form was "rare" in children and "far more common" in adults and
pregnant women. However, if you look at his data, 10% (early hemorrhagic
type) and 20 percent (late hemorrhagic type) was still occurring in
children less than 14 years of age! (2) In the medical literature, if an
event lies outside the 90 percent central range or outside the large
majority (i.e. two standard deviations of the mean) then it may be a
statisitically significant event. It may even be clinically signficant. But
if hemorrhage in children less than 14 years of age occurs 1 out of 5 (20
percent late) to 10 (10 percent early) times, it is not "rare" but
"occasional."
Furthermore, Dr. Rao actually did not support the idea that this
hemorrhagic form of smallpox was due to a different strain of virus (ie.
the India strain) based on epidemiologic evidence in his own study of 254
infected families reported in 1968.(3) Dr. Rao produced the hemorrhagic
form in monkeys by cortisone adminstration before variolation in
1968.(4) In fact, the variola infection in cortisone-treated monkeys
behaved in an almost identical manner to pregnant monkeys and pregnant
women. In addition, the hemorrhagic variety is as prevalent in the
vaccinated as in the unvaccinated. These observations suggest that it is
not a lack of immunity alone that is repsonsible for this highly fatal
variety. If lack of immunity were responsible, this variety should have
been very common in young unvaccinated children, which is not the case.(2)
For these reasons, I am not swayed by the argument that the presence of 2
infant cases of the hemorrhagic form of the disease in 10 patients
represents a signficant event; or that it implies a new strain and/or
weaponized smallpox virus; or that it requires the radical change of our
current smallpox vaccine, and/or empiric antiviral therapy with cidofovir
derivatives, to achieve control of any future bioterrorist attack with
smallpox.
