According to the polio eradication website, there is an advanced
report of isolation of a wild poliovirus (WPV) from a case with onset
of paralysis on 9 Apr 2006. There is a notation stating that "all
cases are importation related".

[Information on the age, gender, geographic location of case within
the country, history of vaccination, history of travel, history of
exposure to travellers from known polio endemic countries is not
available, nor are results of genetic testing of the WPV isolate to
determine probable country origin of the WPV. The last confirmed
case of WPV-associated polio in Myanmar (prior to this case) had date
of onset of paralysis on 13 Feb 2000. More information on this case
when available would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]

According to the polio eradication website, there is an advanced
report of isolation of a wild poliovirus (WPV) from a case with onset
of paralysis on 23 Apr 2006. There is a notation stating that "onset
of paralysis outside of Singapore. Exact history being confirmed".

In Nepal, a new polio case was reported from the west-central region
in the interior of the country. It is the 1st case of wild
poliovirus transmission in the country in 2006. Classification of a
2nd case -- from a contact (close to the border with Bihar state,
India) -- remains outstanding. Both cases are undergoing genetic
sequencing to determine their origins. An appropriate outbreak
response to these most recent cases is currently being finalized.

[The above summary is unclear as to the date of onset of the 1st and
2nd cases to know if the presumed importation case (with presumed
contact with individuals from the known polio-endemic area of Bihar
India) may have been related to the local transmission of WPV noted
as responsible for the case in the west-central region of the country.
On the polio eradication website case count page
<http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/casecount.pdf> there
is a notation that all cases from 2005 onward are
importation-related. As with the cases in Myanmar and Singapore,
more information on the descriptive epidemiology of these cases in
Nepal would be very much appreciated.
While all of the above reports mention importation-related disease,
in the case of Singapore the onset of paralysis occurred outside that
country, suggesting that infection with WPV occurred elsewhere
(specific information on dates of onset and travel are not given).
In contrast, the report on the case in Myanmar mentions "all cases
are importation related" rather than "infection occurred outside of
Myanmar". This differential choice of wording suggests that the
infection with the WPV occurred within the country, either from
exposure to a traveller from a polio-endemic country, or was based on
information from genetic studies of the WPV isolated, putting the
genetic origin of the virus coming from another country where local
transmission of WPV is known to be ongoing. In the case of Nepal, all
cases are described as importation-related, although the specific
information given suggests that there is now a 2nd case associated
with local transmission, leading to the obvious concerns as to
potential re-establishment of persistent chains of local transmission
of WPV. Of note, there was an imported case of WPV in Bangladesh
earlier this year (see below), genetically similar to WPVs identified
in Uttar Pradesh India. More information on both of the above
mentioned cases would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
