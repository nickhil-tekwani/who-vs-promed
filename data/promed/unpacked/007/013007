ref: Brooks JT, Butler JC, Redfield RR. Universal masking to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission--the time is now. JAMA. Published online July 14, 2020. doi:10.1001/jama.2020.13107
-------------------------------------
In this issue of JAMA, Wang, et al. present evidence that universal masking of healthcare workers (HCWs) and patients can help reduce transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. In the largest healthcare system in Massachusetts with more than 75â€¯000 employees, in tandem with routine symptom screening and diagnostic testing of symptomatic HCWs for SARS-CoV-2 infection, leadership mandated a policy of universal masking for all HCWs as well as for all patients. The authors present data that prior to implementation of universal masking in late March 2020, new infections among HCWs with direct or indirect patient contact were increasing exponentially, from 0% to 21.3% (a mean increase of 1.16% per day). However, after the universal masking policy was in place, the proportion of symptomatic HCWs with positive test results steadily declined, from 14.7% to 11.5% (a mean decrease of 0.49% per day). Although not a randomized clinical trial, this study provides critically important data to emphasize that masking helps prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

This change and its association with universal masking is unlikely to be artifactual; throughout the intervention, the number of symptomatic HCWs tested per day appears to have remained steady, while at the same time, the daily number of new SARS-CoV-2 infections in the greater Massachusetts community was continuing to increase or had plateaued.

The authors rightly note that other community-wide and hospital-specific interventions may have contributed to their observation, including the statewide declaration of emergency (10 Mar 2020), new hospital policies to restrict visitors (12 Mar 2020) and elective procedures (14 Mar 2020), statewide school closures and hospital restrictions on business travel and on-site working (16 Mar 2020), local public transportation reductions (17 Mar 2020), issuance of statewide stay-at-home orders (24 Mar 2020), and automation of screening and testing (30 Mar 2020). Nonetheless, it was only after the universal masking policy had been in operation for approximately a week that the temporal trend in positivity of SARS-CoV-2 testing among HCWs declined (as shown in the Figure in the report by Wang, et al).

Covering mouths and noses with filtering materials serves 2 purposes: personal protection against inhalation of harmful pathogens and particulates, and source control to prevent exposing others to infectious microbes that may be expelled during respiration. When asked to wear face coverings, many people think in terms of personal protection. But face coverings are also widely and routinely used as source control. For instance, if given the choice between having surgery performed by a team not wearing some covering over their mouths and noses vs a team that does, almost all patients would reject the former. This option seems absurd because it is known that use of face coverings under these circumstances reduces the risk of surgical site infection caused by microbes generated during the surgical team's conversations or breathing. Face coverings do the same in blocking transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

Early in the pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended that anyone symptomatic for suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) should wear a face covering during transport to medical care and prior to isolation to reduce the spread of respiratory droplets. After emerging data documented transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from persons without symptoms, the recommendation was expanded to the general community, with an emphasis on cloth face coverings that could be made more widely available in the community than surgical masks and to preserve personal protective equipment such as N95 respirators to the highest-risk exposures in healthcare settings. Now, there is ample evidence that persons without symptoms spread infection and may be the critical driver needed to maintain epidemic momentum.

While community use of face coverings has increased substantially, particularly in jurisdictions with mandatory orders, resistance continues. Some have raised concerns that homemade face coverings made from household fabrics may be inferior compared with commercially manufactured products. Cloth face coverings can substantially limit forward dispersion of exhaled respirations that contain potentially infectious respiratory particles in the 1-10 micrometer range that includes aerosol-sized particles, and recent research of household textiles' performance when used as source control suggests cloth face coverings may be able to do so with acceptable efficiency and breathability.

Data from a large healthcare system may be generalizable to the greater community insofar as the findings represent the contribution of masking when individuals are physically close to one another and social distancing is not possible. Like herd immunity with vaccines, the more individuals wear cloth face coverings in public places where they may be close together, the more the entire community is protected.

For the person assessing personal exposure risk when going out in public, minimizing the number of non-household contacts, maintaining a physical distance of at least 6 ft [about 2 metres], and limiting the amount of time around others, especially while indoors and in poorly ventilated areas, are all important considerations. An additional factor in this calculus is the extent that individuals and communities will also be practicing source control by wearing masks. Several state and local governments have issued temporary mandates for face coverings in public places, and some business are requiring mask wear by customers and employees. However, face covering is not needed all the time. It is probably safe for individuals and safe for others to drive alone or to walk or jog alone on an uncrowded route without a face covering. But when individuals choose to go out or must be close to others in public, a cloth face covering can help reduce the spread of COVID-19 from asymptomatic individuals or others. With cloth face coverings, personal protection is derived from their use by all members of the community.

How then can individuals make the most of this intervention? 1st, public health officials and leaders need to ensure that the public understands clearly when and how to wear cloth face coverings properly and continue building the evidence base for their effectiveness. 2nd, although cloth face coverings are generally well tolerated for short periods, with prolonged use they can be irritating or difficult for some people to breathe through, especially in hot or humid environments. Innovation is needed to extend their physical comfort and ease of use. 3rd, the public needs consistent, clear, and appealing messaging that normalizes community masking. At this critical juncture when COVID-19 is resurging, broad adoption of cloth face coverings is a civic duty, a small sacrifice reliant on a highly effective low-tech solution that can help turn the tide favorably in national and global efforts against COVID-19.

[Community-level protection afforded by use of cloth face coverings can reduce the number of new infections and facilitate cautious easing of more disruptive community interventions such as stay-at-home orders and business closings with their own implications. How long we need to maintain these measures in place is still an unanswered question. - Mod.UBA]

[2] Brazil: meat plants as source of COVID-19 outbreaks
Date: Wed 15 Jul 2020 06:32 EDT
Source: The Guardian [abridged, edited]

Brazilian meat plants helped spread COVID-19 in at least 3 different places across the country as the virus continues to migrate from big cities to the country's vast interior, experts have said. At the beginning of this week, the country was 2nd only to the US with 1.88 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and 72 833 deaths. Meat plants have stayed open during the pandemic, and staff work closely together, often in refrigerated areas. Other countries, including the US, Canada, Ireland, and Germany, have also seen clusters around slaughterhouses. The conditions can create perfect COVID-19 breeding centres.

"We see a lot of workers infected," said Priscila Schvarcz, a prosecutor from the Public Ministry of Labour (MPT), a branch of the federal prosecution service charged with supervising labour laws, and a member of a national meat plant taskforce based in Rio Grande do Sul state in southern Brazil. Rio Grande do Sul has been hard hit. As of 23 Jun [2020], 4957 meat workers had tested positive at 32 plants in the state, 1/3 of the total coronavirus cases in the area, prosecutors said. Five employees and 12 people in contact with them had died.

A study for the MPT showed that COVID-19 cases in central and southern Brazil were clustered around towns where meat plants were located and workers lived. "There is a direct relationship," said Ernesto Galindo, the researcher who produced the study.

At a JBS plant in Dourados, in Mato Grosso do Sul state in the centre-west region, more than 4000 employees were tested and nearly a quarter were positive, prosecutors said. The company suspended 1600 workers on full pay but did not close the plant. As of 14 Jul [2020], the town had 3481 cases, a quarter of the state's total.

The JBS plant in Dourados "was the initial focus for the outbreak," said Andyane Tetila, an infectious diseases specialist in Dourados who works for the state health service. The JBS plant has 103 indigenous workers, many of whom live in nearby reserves where more than 150 people were subsequently infected, said Indianara Machado, an indigenous nurse who works in the reserve. Another 85 people tested positive at a BRF plant in the town. The company said workers in this situation are suspended on pay, given medical attention, and monitored by occupational health specialists at the company until they recover.

[JBS] said that the health and safety of its team members was its key priority. It had adopted a strict protocol on control, prevention, and safety at all processing units, in full compliance with government-mandated rules.

JBS said it followed guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization as well as "specialised" physicians. "Each test assessment takes place on a case-by-case basis," the company said. It disinfects factories daily and takes workers' temperatures; it has increased its fleet of buses and puts those in risk groups and anyone with symptoms on paid leave.

[3] Selected countries
[A] China: National Health Commission, 83 612 total cases, 4634 deaths
[B] South Korea: 13 612 confirmed cases, 291 deaths
[C] Italy: 243 506 total cases, 34 997 deaths
[D] Iran: 264 561 total cases, 13 410 deaths
[E] USA: 3 616 747 total cases, 140 140 deaths

[These countries have been selected based on having had significant surges with SARS-CoV-2 infections, but different responses. In some cases, transmission was almost interrupted, but resurgences have occurred, and countries have handled them differently. One observation is that lifting of restrictions has led to major resurgences in some areas; in others, early new threats seem to be importations, but community spread does recur. Good contact tracing has helped to shorten the time with new clusters, and temporary new restrictions have impacted. Countries not implementing restrictions have done more poorly with major resurgences. - Mod.UBA]

[The 1 new confirmed case in the past 24 hours was imported, and it is now 10 days that no new cases have been reported from Beijing.

There were 2 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic individuals (1 imported) and no new conversions from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. Since 18 May 2020, China has reported 37 cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic infection.

Hong Kong reported 19 new cases. The newly reported cases involve 8 males and 11 females aged between 17 and 75 years. Among them, 5 had travel history during the incubation period (https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202007/15/P2020071500824.htm). Hong Kong has implemented new restrictions: 1) masks mandatory on public transport; 2) dine-in services banned 6 pm to 5 am, maximum 4/table; 3) bars, gyms, karaoke lounges, and amusement parks closed; public gatherings back from 50 to 4 people maximum; 4) passengers from high-risk countries must produce proof of negative PCR before boarding flight to Hong Kong (https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3092920/coronavirus-hong-kong-toughen-social-distancing).

Takeaway message: China continues to have importations of infected individuals with SARS-CoV-2. Hong Kong is dealing with increased local transmission associated with the lifting of restrictions; new severe restrictions have been announced.

[In the past 24 hours, according to the report at the source URL, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 61 cases with 2 new deaths, compared with 39 cases and 0 new deaths in the previous day (14 Jul 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 93 consecutive days. There were 14 locally transmitted cases: Seoul (6), Gyeonggi (3), Incheon (2), Gwangju (1), Daejeon (1), Gangwon (1); and 47 imported cases: airport quarantine (20), Gyeonggi (18), Deagu (2), Gangwon (2), Seoul (1), Ulsan (1), Incheon (1), Chungbuk (1), and Gyeongnam (1). Seven provinces reported no newly confirmed cases (compared with 12 provinces yesterday, 14 Jul 2020).

The overall impression hasn't changed: Lifting of measures has been accompanied by increases in locally acquired infections through increasing clusters related to gatherings of people at employment (bringing it outside employment to contacts) and in houses of worship, and bars and clubs. However, that being said, importations are also playing a major role in the country as well.

The coronavirus pandemic in the Iranian capital Tehran has reached critical levels, spurring health authorities to call for reintroduction of restrictions including a halt in religious gatherings. Iran's daily death toll is now hovering around 200.

Iranian authorities do not announce the death toll of the pandemic for individual cities or provinces but from what they have said it appears the capital Tehran now has a very high death toll, possibly even around 50 a day.

According to Alireza Zali, chief of the Coronavirus Combat Headquarters of Tehran, 890 COVID patients were hospitalized in Tehran since [Tue 14 Jul 2020]. Zali said the situation in the capital is "very complex "and a new approach is required for dealing with it.

This week some restrictions including closure of gyms swimming pools were reintroduced in Tehran but Zali said more activities including Friday prayers and all tests and exams should come to a halt for the time being. On [Wed 15 Jul 2020] it was announced that mosques will be closed for a week in Tehran.

New York City had a cumulative total of 216 834 cases as of 13:00 EDT (GMT-4) on 15 Jul 2020 (+366 since 14 Jul 2020) including 18 708 (+26 since 14 Jul 2020) confirmed deaths and an additional 4619 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

The top 10 states in terms of daily reported cases in descending order are Texas, Florida, California, Georgia, Arizona, Tennessee, Louisiana, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Alabama. This list includes states that are showing major increases in daily cases reported beginning with the lifting of restrictions around the end of May 2020. All of the top 10 states reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, with the range being 1812 to 12 235. In terms of cumulative case reports, the order is unchanged from previous days with New York as number one, followed by California, Florida, Texas, New Jersey, Illinois, Arizona, Georgia, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania. A total of 43 states and entities have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.

In the past 24 hours, the proportion of newly confirmed cases was 1.9%. The 7-day average of newly confirmed cases for the past 7 days is 22.2% higher than the 7-day average for the preceding 7 days, consistent with the ongoing pandemic in the country.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html) has data on cases, hospitalization, testing, and epidemiologic variables such as age, race, ILI (influenza-like illness), surveillance, and emergency room visits, which are definitely worth reviewing, as a welcome series of analyses. According to CDC data, as of 14 Jul 2020, the percentage of laboratory specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 with a molecular assay remains at 9% out of 45 429 824 tests performed, consistent with the ongoing, not-yet-under-control pandemic in the country (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html).

[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of reported cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 13 683 781, with reports of cases by 217 countries and territories worldwide. The global case count rose by 1.7% in the past 24 hours. The USA and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts. In the past 24 hours though, the USA reported the most newly confirmed cases (71 670) followed by Brazil (39 705) and India (32 682). The total cumulative case counts for the top 5 countries (USA, Brazil, India, Russia, and Peru) represent over half of the total cases reported globally (55.7%). A global total of 586 194 deaths have been reported, an increase of 5593 deaths in the past 24 hours.

In descending rank order, the USA is number 1 for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by Brazil, India, South Africa, Mexico, Russia, Colombia, Argentina, Peru, and Bangladesh. The same 10 countries as yesterday (14 Jul 2020), in a slightly different order. All these countries are currently experiencing major community-based transmission and considered global hot spots. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed cases goes from 3533 to 71 670. The number of daily newly confirmed cases is climbing rapidly in the USA. Also worthy of note is that 6 out of the top 10 countries for daily reported newly confirmed cases are from the Americas region, consistent with the continued dominance of SARS-CoV-2 activity.

Impression: The SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts. - Mod.UBA]
