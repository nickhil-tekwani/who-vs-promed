The Indiana Department of Natural Resources were forced last week to
destroy about 110 000 fingerling steelhead (trout) at a hatchery
after discovery of the deadly IPN virus.
"The detection came in the nick of time, as the winter-run steelhead
were due to be released soon in Trail Creek and the Little Calumet
rivers. We hated to destroy these fish, but it would have been
irresponsible for us to stock them," said DNR hatchery supervisor
Gary Armstrong. "We had to avoid the spread of the virus to other
fish at the hatchery and we didn't want to release (the virus) into
Lake Michigan where it could infect other fish."
Armstrong said that IPN has been detected in Great Lakes fish before,
but that there never has been an outbreak of the contagious fish
virus.
