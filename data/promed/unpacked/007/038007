I would appreciate your help in reporting in ProMED-mail a new rural
anthrax outbreak.

Location: Navarro, Buenos Aires Province - Argentina (highway 47 between
Navarro and Lujan).

9 animals suddenly died within a 300 head herd of 2 year old steers; none
showed blood from natural openings.

2 animals showed blood in spleen, mesenterium, and lymph nodes at necropsy.
The big vessels showed uncoagulated blood. The animals had not been
vaccinated and the farm did not have a history of anthrax.

The outbreak occurred after a long dry period followed by rain. During
necropsy the veterinarian recalled being stung by mosquitoes and 48 h after
started showing clinical signs of skin anthrax in his left arm, generalized
edema, and enlarged axilar lymph node. He was treated with ciprofloxacin.

[If one does not expect anthrax it can be quite a surprise when that is
what it turns out to be doing a necropsy! And necropsy-related human
cutaneous cases are not at all uncommon, with or without mosquito bites.
Mosquitoes are not normally regarded as mechanical vectors of this disease
but scratching said bites with a bloody hand or fingers (with or without
gloves) would inoculate any bites. It is always wise to wash one's hands
and forearms after any necropsy.

Hot dry weather interrupted by a rain shower is not an unusual scenario for
an anthrax outbreak. What probably happens is that the heat-stressed
animals, with climate lowered innate resistance, graze the newly sprouting
grass where the rain has collected and softened the soil, and thus get
infected. This would presume that there was an old anthrax site/grave on
this estancia in spite of the anecdotal evidence to the contrary.

Our thanks to Ramon for this interesting report. - Mod.MHJ]
