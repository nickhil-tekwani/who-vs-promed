Date of previous outbreak of rabies in Switzerland reported to the OIE: September
2002 [in a bat].
[Date of previous outbreak of rabies in France reported to the OIE: 27 September
2002 in a dog, ex North Africa -- see ref. at end. - Mod.JW]

Information received on 29 Jul 2003 from Dr Hans Wyss, Director of the
Federal Veterinary Office, Bern:
Report date: 29 Jul 2003.
Background:
----------
In May 2003, a stray dog of unknown origin -- then aged 3 months -- was
caught on a road in the Canton of Geneva. It was brought to an animal
shelter in Bernex, Canton of Geneva.
On 25 Jun 2003, the dog was adopted by a family living in Nyon, Canton of
Geneva.
On 15 Jul 2003, the dog showed neurological signs, and the consulted
veterinarian subsequently euthanised it.
On 24 Jul 2003, rabies was confirmed by direct immunofluorescence at the
National Reference Laboratory.
The most likely origin of the dog is illegal transport as an infected
'holiday animal' from a rabies area into Switzerland. Given the short
distance (2 km) between the place where the dog was found and the French
border, it is also possible that the infected animal was abandoned in
France and crossed the border to Switzerland.
Control measures: prophylactic vaccination of persons exposed to the dog
after 15 Jun 2003. Potential contact animals are being traced and subject
to veterinary examination. Vaccination of cats and dogs is compulsory in
the Canton of Geneva.

[This report does not specifically request that human contacts be alerted
so that they can receive post-exposure prophylaxis. However, it does
indicate that people exposed to the dog after 15 Jun 2003 should receive
such prophylaxis. From 1991 to 2000, there were only 4 cases of rabies in
dogs in Switzerland. In 2001 this jumped to 14. Over that time period
there were no cases of human rabies, imported or otherwise.
Rabies, of course, remains an important public health problem, with over 50 000
deaths per year [worldwide]. For people who normally live in rabies-free
countries, rabies exposure can occur via dogs from endemic areas that are
transferred to rabies-free countries, or by people traveling to endemic areas.
Petting a stray puppy can pose a risk. If bitten by a puppy that might have rabies, it
is imperative not to neglect post-exposure prophylaxis. Twice in recent years this
has been neglected in the United States and has resulted in the death of the person
bitten. - Mod.PC]
