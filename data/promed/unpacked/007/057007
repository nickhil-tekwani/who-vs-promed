"Bioterrorism-Related Inhalation Anthrax: The First 10 Cases Reported in
the United States" is now on-line in the JED available at:
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/index.htm>
Abstract: [reset to make it easier to read. - Mod.MHJ] From 4 Oct to 2 Nov
2001, the first 10 confirmed cases of inhalational anthrax caused by
intentional release of _Bacillus anthracis_ were identified in the United
States. Epidemiologic investigation indicated that the outbreak, in the
District of Columbia, Florida, New Jersey, and New York, resulted from
intentional delivery of _Bacillus anthracis_ spores through mailed letters
or packages. We describe the clinical presentation and course of these
cases of bioterrorism-related inhalational anthrax.
The median age of patients was 56 years (range 43 to 73 years), 70% were
male, and except for one, who was a journalist (n=1), all were postal
workers (n=6), mail handlers or sorters (n=2) known or believed to have
processed, handled, or received letters containing _B. anthracis_ spores.
The median incubation period from the time of exposure to onset of
symptoms, when known (n=6), was 4 days (range 4-6 days).
Symptoms at initial presentation included fever and chills (n=10), sweats
(n=7), fatigue or malaise (n=10), minimal or nonproductive cough (n=9),
dyspnea (n=8), and nausea or vomiting (n=8). The median white blood cell
count was 9.9 X 10 3 /mm 3 (range 7.5 to 13.3), often with increased
neutrophils and band forms. Of the patients, 7 had elevated serum
transaminase levels, and 5 were hypoxic.
All 10 patients had abnormal chest X-rays; abnormalities included
infiltrates (n=7), pleural effusion (n=8), and mediastinal widening (7
patients). Computed tomography of the chest was performed on 8 patients,
and mediastinal lymphadenopathy was present in 7. With multidrug antibiotic
regimens and supportive care, survival of patients (60%) was markedly
higher (<15%) than previously reported.
p12:
No predominant underlying diseases or conditions were noted in the patients
with bioterrorism-related inhalational anthrax. One patient (Case 5) had a
remote history of sarcoidosis but had been free of clinical illness or
treatment associated with this diagnosis for the past 25 years. One other
case of inhalational anthrax associated with underlying sarcoidosis has
been reported (12). The patient in case 5 also had diabetes mellitus, a
condition present in one previously reported case (12). Smoking did not
appear to be a risk factor for inhalational anthrax.
[So far we have only speculation for the upper age range on these cases. -

Anthrax Traces Found in 5 Offices
---------------------------------
WASHINGTON -- Trace amounts of anthrax have been discovered in 5 more
Senate offices in the same building where a letter containing the bacteria
was opened 15 Oct 2001. Capitol Police Lt. Dan Nichols said the latest
findings
were not unexpected. Police believe letters delivered to other offices in
the Hart Senate office building may have been contaminated by the
anthrax-filled letter sent to Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D.
Anthrax spores were found in the offices of Sens. Max Baucus, D-Mont.; Russ
Feingold, D-Wis.; Joe Lieberman, D-Conn.; Barbara Mikulski, D-Md.; and
Arlen Specter, R-Pa, Nichols said Sunday. All are in the same general area
of the Hart building as Daschle's offices.

Feinstein, Kyl Introduce Bill on Possession and Use of Select Agents
----------------------------------------------------------
Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Jon Kyl (R-AZ) yesterday introduced S.
1661, a bill that seeks to tighten the rules and regulations regarding the
possession and use of select agents. According the Sen. Feinstein's floor
statement on the bill, among other provisions, the bill would require:
(a) Labs to be certified with the Department of Health and Human Services
before they can possess or use select agents;
(b) Individuals in those labs who have access to the agents to go through
background checks;
(c) Labs to institute stricter safety procedures; and
(d) Any entity wishing to possess select agents to demonstrate a legitimate
purpose for that possession.
Additional details will be provided after a review of the legislation is
completed.

Thousands Infected With Natural Anthrax
---------------------------------------
The 17 people who have been infected by the disease in recent weeks in the
United States are not suffering alone. But in places as far afield as
Zimbabwe, Kyrgyzstan and Indonesia, authorities are more worried about
suspicious cows than suspicious envelopes. The cattle-borne form of the
disease -- not the weaponized version created in a laboratory -- can be
found in nearly every region of the globe with grazing animals.
"Anthrax is not strange. This has always been here and people get along
with it," said Eliphas Nyamogo, a teacher in Kenya. "I think it has been
much scarier in the United States because it is not something they have had
for many years."
Last year, at least 2000 people around the world contracted the disease
from animals, according to incomplete statistics from the World
Organization for Animal Health, which tracks human anthrax infections as
well as animal outbreaks. The animals get the disease themselves from
spores in the ground.
Anthrax thrives in cattle, sheep, and goats. Its spillover into humans is
purely an accident of nature, said Dr. Ottorino Cosivi, an official at the
World Health Organization. The vast majority of human cases are skin
infections, caused by handling tainted meat. A few people get the more
deadly intestinal infections by eating the infected meat, and on very rare
occasions, anthrax is inhaled, usually by people working with wool or hides
from infected animals. Some epidemiologists roughly estimate that for every
10 infected animals one person gets skin anthrax. When an animal catches
the disease and dies, infected fluids drip into the ground, [and] if
another animal [grazes that part of] the field, it too can become infected.
The spore can live in the ground for decades, and in at least one case has
been found to live for centuries.
Heavy rains often trigger outbreaks, uncovering spores that had been buried
under the surface. But droughts trigger outbreaks too, concentrating the
spores that may have blown into shrinking water holes. "It stays in the
soil for so long we can have an outbreak any day," said Gerhard Schutte,
general manager of South Africa's Red Meat Producers Organization.
In southwestern Zimbabwe, at least 40 people have been infected with the
disease since 20 Oct 2001, and a child died 26 Oct 2001, probably after
handling
meat from infected cattle, said Dr. Christopher Zishiri, the local medical
director.
In Kenya, 2 people in the central district of Nyeri contracted skin anthrax
last month after skinning a cow that had mysteriously died. They recovered
after treatment.
A total of 396 people contracted anthrax in Turkey last year. All of them
survived, according to the Turkish Health Ministry.
The disease is widespread throughout central Asia. Tajikistan reported 338
human cases last year, and 33 people were infected last October in one
outbreak in Kazakstan, mostly after illegally slaughtering sick cattle
without veterinary supervision. India and Indonesia have also experienced
recent outbreaks.
Last year 6 members of a Minnesota farm family were treated for anthrax
when 2 of them showed signs of intestinal anthrax after eating meat from an
infected cow they had raised and slaughtered. [It was not confirmed. -
Mod.MHJ] But cases of natural anthrax [in humans] are extremely rare in the
United States, where stringent slaughterhouse regulations weed out bad meat.

[Which is why I will always insist that human cases of anthrax follow from
veterinary mistakes. When we do our job right, there are no human cases.
