Lumpy Skin Disease in Greece - Preliminary Outbreak Assessment [for references, please go to the origin]
-----------------------------------------
1. Disease Report
Greece has reported to the EU Animal Disease Notification System outbreaks of lumpy skin disease [LSD] in the Evros region on the European border with Turkey (see map inset; OIE, 2015) in 2 holdings of beef cattle. The source of disease is likely to be vector spread from the outbreaks reported not only in June 2015 but also in the last few days in Turkey in Edirne region. Disease control measures are in place including movement controls and culling infected animals. Greece also has in place a 20-km surveillance zone. Vaccination is not currently allowed in the EU as there are no approved vaccines for use.

Turkey has been reporting disease regularly since 2013 and, in June 2015, reported the disease had jumped into the European side of the country. Please see our previous POA on Turkey at: https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/437163/poa-lumpy-skin-turkey-201506.pdf.

***This is the 1st time the disease has been reported in the EU.***

2. Situation Assessment
The main pathways for disease transmission are vector transmission (mechanical, not biological transmission and over shorter distance), movement of live animals (for long distance "jumps"), or contact with contaminated material including fresh skins and hides from infected animals. The virus can remain active in skin scabs and dried hides for up to 6 months if kept in the dark.

A Defra-commissioned risk assessment in 2014 assessed the current level of risk for entry into the UK of sheep pox/goat pox or lumpy skin disease through trade of one untreated cattle hide or skin from an EU Member State (MS) was low, given the herd prevalence of SPGP in Greece in 2013/14 and assuming LSD, if introduced to Greece, would reach similar prevalence levels. That assessment considered the likely viral load in a subclinical animal and high chance of survival of the virus during the journey together with the chance of an infected hide being legally exported from an EU MS. The level of LSD virus on an infected hide remaining after dispatch would probably be very low.

Due to lack of data on legal trade volumes for EU dispatched products, it was not possible to assess the annual risk of entry of LSDV through such imports. EFSA carried out a more in depth analysis of the transmission routes and concluded that the trade in hides and skins was a risk pathway which required further investigation, particularly around whether processing is capable of inactivating the virus. To date, the risks from illegal importation of skins and hides have not been addressed due to lack of data.

In response to the outbreak, the EU has implemented some short term protective measures which mean there will be change to the current regulations governing the movement of live animals, products of animal origin, and unprocessed animal by-products, prohibiting the dispatch from the Evros region unless for disposal. In addition, the likely contact between such products and cattle herds in the UK is mitigated by sensible biosecurity arrangements. Therefore, the risk of outbreak of disease in the UK from such imported hides and skins is likely to be low.

3. Conclusion
Although the risk of introduction of LSD into the UK remains very low and has not significantly increased as a result of these outbreaks in Europe, it highlights the general concerns about the region with respect to transboundary diseases and effectiveness of controls in place.

No approved vaccine is available in the EU for prevention of LSD, but rapid detection, movement restrictions and culling infected herds should control disease. Raising awareness with livestock keepers and veterinarians in regions at risk is also paramount. We will continue to monitor the situation.
