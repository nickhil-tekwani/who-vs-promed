Federal Minister of Health Bahar Idris Abu Garda has acknowledged the mortality cases owing to the spread of haemorrhagic fever in several states in Darfur. He has told the press that his Ministry has deployed medical teams to intervene and investigate the deadly fever.

His teams will prepare "detailed reports" on how to take appropriate action against the fever. A medical team from the federal Ministry of Health already arrived in Ed Daein, the capital of East Darfur, on Wednesday [21 Oct 2015], transferring suspect cases among patients into quarantine.

Medical sources have confirmed to Radio Dabanga that the spread of the epidemic haemorrhagic fever has reached "critical stages." They said that the health authorities in the states of Darfur lack medicines to combat the disease, pointing to the spread of the disease in Central and East Darfur.

The medical sources warned people of the swift transmission of infections throughout the region. They stressed the need to declare a 'State of Health Emergency' in Darfur in order to allow the intervention of international organisations that are able to rescue the infected people.

Earlier this week, the coordinator of the Central Darfur camps reported that 39 camp residents in Zalingei locality were afflicted by the viral fever. 16 of them had died.

In statements to Sudan Tribune on Thursday [22 Oct 2015], South Darfur Health Minister Yacoub Ibrahim El Dmoki stressed that the "state is free of viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) diseases," adding they are "closely monitoring the situation."

He confirmed the arrival of a federal medical team to Nyala on its way to East Darfur state to investigate reports about the outbreak there.

Also the Director of the Epidemiology Department in East Darfur state, Mohamed Joda, told Sudan Tribune that he had ruled out the spread in the region.

[It is of serious concern that this outbreak has been going on in the Darfur region for over 2 weeks without a diagnosis. ProMED-mail 1st reported the outbreak on 8 Oct 2015 (see archive no. 20151008.3700659). Halting the outbreak without benefit of a diagnosis of the etiological agent involved will be difficult. As noted in the previous post, undiagnosed hemorrhagic fever cases have been reported sporadically in various parts of the Sudan, including Darfur, in recent years. Mod.ML commented concerning previous cases, "Hemorrhagic fever can be caused by a variety of viruses that have been known to occur in Sudan. Viral hemorrhagic fever [VHF] can be caused by 4 distinct viral families: arenaviruses (Lassa fever virus), filoviruses (Ebola virus and Marburg virus), bunyaviruses (hantaviruses that cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome [HFRS], Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever [CCHF] virus, Rift Valley fever virus), and flaviviruses (dengue, yellow fever). Most VHFs are zoonoses and the viruses are usually geographically restricted to the areas where their host species live. Certain bacterial infections can also cause hemorrhagic fever, such as scrub typhus, leptospirosis, and plague."

As Mod.ML noted with previous cases, and is relevant to these, "There is no information provided in the report above that suggests any specific virus, nor is it indicated that samples are being taken to permit laboratory diagnosis of the disease. ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving additional information from knowledgeable sources as it becomes available" (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20141101.2921031).

Many of the past undiagnosed outbreaks in Darfur occurred in camps of internally displaced refugees. There was a serious outbreak of yellow fever (YF) in the Darfur states in 2012 to 2013. If these current cases are due to YF or Ebola virus disease, urgent diagnosis and control measures, especially vaccination for YF, are needed, as the situation can get out of hand rapidly, as it did in the previous YF outbreak in Darfur and the Ebola virus disease outbreak in West Africa.
