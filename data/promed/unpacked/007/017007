An alarming outbreak of Legionnaires' disease in Melbourne and Adelaide has been linked to industrial cooling towers in both of the cities.

A total of 7 people have been hospitalized after contracting the pneumonia, with 4 aged between 45 and 78 years in Victoria [Melbourne] and 4 aged 58 to 77 in South Australia [Adelaide].

The outbreak in Melbourne is suspected to have originated from several cooling towers near a Cranbourne shopping center, southeast of the CBD [central business district]. Building operators in Adelaide's south are also being urged to decontaminate air-conditioning and industrial cooling towers following 3 cases of Legionnaires' disease. SA [South Australia] Health says 2 men and one woman from the southern suburbs have been hospitalized after contracting the respiratory infection.

It is not yet clear if the cases are related and the source has not been identified.

Samples have been taken from the cooling towers to determine the true source of the infection.

People who have been exposed to areas near the cooling towers could still develop symptoms over the next 10 days, health experts warn.

Only last month [April 2017] 5 cases of Legionnaires' disease were found to have involved individuals who spent time in the eastern half of Melbourne's CBD and at Southbank. It can be contracted by inhaling fine droplets of water, which have been infected, such as the spray, which emits from cooling towers.

Those most susceptible to Legionnaires' include men and women aged over 50, heavy smokers, heavy drinkers, people with diabetes, people suffering from chronic lung disease and those with lowered immunity.

So far this year 47 people have contracted the illness.

[Melbourne is the capital and most populous city of the Australian state of Victoria and the 2nd-most populous city in Australia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne). The Legionnaires' disease outbreak of 4 cases in Melbourne is suspected to have originated from cooling towers near a shopping center in Cranbourne, a suburb 43 km (26.7 miles) southeast of Melbourne's central business district.

The news report above says that 5 additional cases of Legionnaires' disease last month [April 2017] were linked to the eastern half of Melbourne's CBD and at Southbank, which is an inner urban neighborhood, 1 km (about 0.6 miles) south of Melbourne's central business district.

Adelaide is the capital city of the Australian state of South Australia, and the 5th-most populous city of Australia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide). The 3 cases there are said to be linked to Adelaide's southern suburbs.

Genotyping the clinical isolates from the patients with Legionnaires' disease will help establish whether these are common source outbreaks. Matching the genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_ will identify the environmental source for the individual cases.

More than 70 percent of cases of Legionnaires' disease are due to _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1, except in Australia and New Zealand, where _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 has accounted for only 45.7 percent of cases of community-acquired legionellosis and 30.4 percent are _Legionella longbeachae_ (Yu VL, et al: Distribution of _Legionella_ species and serogroups isolated by culture in patients with sporadic community-acquired legionellosis: an international collaborative survey. J Infect Dis. 2002; 186(1): 127-8).

Legionnaires' disease due to _L. longbeachae_ is associated with exposure to aerosols generated during use of non-sterilized potting soil, which apparently contains free-living amoebae and elevated storage temperatures may foster the intra-amoebic growth of _L. longbeachae_ in the potting soil (Ross IS, Mee BJ, Riley TV. _Legionella longbeachae_ in Western Australian potting mix. Med J Aust 1997; 166(7): 387).
