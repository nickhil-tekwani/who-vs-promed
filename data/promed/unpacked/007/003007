Jaundice continues to spread in the areas of Tripoli, where it first appeared, and has spread to neighboring areas as well, including Akkar. Despite the uproar around the spread of the disease, the infected cases are treated at home, and admissions to hospitals in Tripoli are declining.

Similar to Tripoli, jaundice disease has reached Akkar, and there are many cases that are spreading in regions and villages. There is no doubt that the spread of the disease has created a state of fear among the parents for their children. The fear was present as soon as they heard about the disease in Tripoli. However, the greatest fear stems from the parents' inability to take their children to hospitals. The high costs of hospitalization is the cause in the absence of any guarantee of support.

Fear also stems from the fact that most mothers do not know about the disease and its symptoms. As soon as they see symptoms such as yellowing of the face or diarrhea appear in the children, the thinking goes directly to the possibility of jaundice, without knowing what methods to follow and treatments for such a disease.

"There is no need for all this panic, and the matter is not out of the ordinary. This is a seasonal disease that recurs every year, and it is not a new, emergency epidemic that medicine knows nothing about, as is the case for the coronavirus epidemic, for example." With these words, Dr. Kifah Al-Kassar began his statement to Nida Al-Watan and added: "Roughly from the end of Ramadan [1 May 2022] until now, such cases have passed us by, and I do not see that there is an unknown epidemic or the like. This is hepatitis A which is viral hepatitis and is the least dangerous among the types [of hepatitis], and its treatments and medications are known, and a doctor's review is necessary in order to determine the treatment program required for several days that do not exceed a week."

Al-Kassar stressed the need for prevention in all cases, for the people to know the sources of water, and for the water to be clean, in addition to maintaining sterilization. As for vegetables, it is better to wash them with salt. Dr. Al-Kassar reassured that this disease does not require hospitalization unless the presence of immunologically related diseases coincides with the affected patient, which leads to complications that require hospitalization. Although the Ministry of Health did not specify the reasons behind the cases and the spread of jaundice in Tripoli, most of the information in this regard intersects with the issue of ensuring the quality of water used for drinking and domestic use, in addition to the mixing of groundwater with sewage water, which is one of the main reasons for the emergence of this disease.
