Botulism is being reported more frequently in the territory of the
Rostov region. Cases of botulism are connected to dried fish prepared
in domestic conditions or purchased from others, and also from tinned
vegetables, prepared in domestic conditions.
Annually, most patients are found in the Taganrog, Azov,
Rostov-on-Don, Neklinovsky, Azov, and Dubovsky districts. During the
1st 6 months of 2007, 14 inhabitants felt ill with botulism in the
Rostov region.
Recent cases have been registered in Neklinovsky and Azov districts
and in Rostov-on-Don. [A patient in the Neklinovsky district cooked
with] vegetables canned at home and was hospitalized in serious
condition. Botulism toxin type A was found in his blood.
A schoolgirl felt ill in the Azov district; she had eaten dried fish
of domestic manufacturing. Botulism toxin type E was found in her blood.
The case of botulism in Rostov-on-Don is also connected with
consuming dried fish of domestic manufacturing. Botulism toxin type E
was identified in the dried fish that caused the intoxication.
With [the aim of preventing] botulism, Rospotrebnadzor (the Federal
Services for Consumer Protection and Human Welfare) of the Rostov
region recommends that [people abstain from purchasing food in places
not authorized for trade, or in the markets from private persons, as
well as dried or smoked fish of domestic preparation.

[More than 20 cases of botulism were reported in the Rostov region in
2006. For the period 2005-2006, a total of 10 persons died from
botulism in the region. Most frequently, lethal outcomes were
connected with late access to medical care (2-3 days after onset).
Cases of the disease related to the consumption of dried and smoked
fish are prevalent in the southern areas of the region, located in a
steppe zone in the mouth of the river Don and on the coast of the
Taganrog Gulf of the Azov sea.
Botulism associated with the consumption of canned mushrooms more
often is reported in the northern forest-steppe areas. The disease
linked to the consumption of home-canned vegetables occurs
everywhere. Botulinum toxin type E, usually associated with marine
sources, prevails in the region. - Mod.NP]
