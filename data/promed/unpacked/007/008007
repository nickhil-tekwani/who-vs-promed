Local officials and farmers in Akre, Duhok province, warn that an unknown disease will ravage this year's [2019] fig harvest, destroying almost half of the area's crops. On average, 3600 tons of figs are produced in Akre every year, but this figure is set to drop by 45%, Akre agriculture department [said].

A farmer [said], "There is no product. All the [figs] have fallen. I have sprayed the trees with pesticides twice, but it seems to be ineffective." Some of his figs have already yellowed and fallen from their trees.

Though unable to specify which disease is blighting [the] trees, [the local] agriculture directorate put forward a whole host of reasons behind the outbreak, [including] an instant change in weather, improper pruning and watering, and not using medicine that protects trees. Seasonal diseases that harm fruit harvests in the Kurdistan region and threaten farmer livelihood often rear their head.

Last year [2018], an apple scab disease saw an unprecedentedly low harvest yield in Duhok province [ProMED-mail post 20181113.6141388]. Turkish shelling forced many farmers on the Turkey-Iraq border to abandon their farms. [The farmers] were unable to treat their trees with preventative products, leading to the spread of disease.

[A number of fungal pathogens (causing, for example, leaf rust, leaf spot, anthracnose), as well as _Fig mosaic virus_ (genus _Emaravirus_, transmitted by mites) and root knot nematodes (_Meloidogyne_ species) have been reported as causing the main diseases affecting cultivated edible figs (_Ficus carica_). Physiological disorders due to environmental factors are also known to affect these trees. Furthermore, combinations of pathogen infections, insect pests, and/or environmental factors may be possible. From the symptoms described above, no conclusions can be drawn as to the causes of the problems in Dahuk.

Reliable molecular diagnosis of any pathogen(s) involved will be needed in order to be able to design suitable management strategies for the region. The forced neglect of trees described above would certainly make disease control very difficult.
