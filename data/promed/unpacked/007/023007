A new cucumber variety with "intermediate resistance" (that is tolerance, see comment below) to _Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus_ (CGMMV) has been released. It maintains high yield and good fruit quality even under intense disease pressure.

The 1st incidence of the dreaded CGMMV in Germany for 2016 has already been reported in mid-April. In the summer of 2015, there had been considerable losses for various producers so that supply contracts could not be fulfilled. In addition to complete losses of plants, infection also leads to a decrease in fruit quality.

The virus was reported for the 1st time in Europe in 1965 and has developed into a massive problem for cucumber production over recent years.

[_Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus_ (CGMMV; genus _Tobamovirus_) is a major pathogen of cucurbit crops with reported yield losses of around 15 per cent. The virus has a narrow host range. Many strains, including the type strain occurring in Europe, are limited to Cucurbitaceae, but some isolates have been reported which can also affect a number of species in other families, including Amaranthaceae and Solanaceae. Symptoms vary in different host species and may be masked in field crops. They may include severe leaf mosaic, deformation of vines, and internal fruit symptoms such as discolouration and rotting of flesh.

CGMMV is both seed and pollen transmitted. It is extremely stable and can also be spread by mechanical means (human activities, insect damage, plant-to-plant contact), with contaminated agricultural tools, infected plant material, in water, and contaminated soil. Spread by specific insect vectors appears doubtful. Disease management may include removal of virus reservoirs, phytosanitary practices and use of certified clean seed or other planting material. Transgenic rootstock lines of some cucurbit crops (such as watermelon) with resistance to CGMMV have been or are being developed.

The plant breeders above define the term 'intermediate resistance' as cultivars that limit, but do not prevent, multiplication of the respective pathogen and show only mild symptoms, if any (see link below). Such cultivars would correctly need to be called tolerant, rather than resistant. In contrast, resistant cultivars are denominated by them as having 'high' or 'standard' resistance. This misuse of the terms is unfortunate.
