[From 19-22 Aug 2016, there were 4 consecutive days with no active cases of MERS-CoV -- a rare occurrence since these types of daily reports have been issued. There were 2 cases reported since then, 1 on 23 Aug 2016 and the 2nd today, 26 Aug 2016. The case reported on 23 Aug 2016 was a household contact of an earlier case reported on 8 Aug 2016 from Huraymla, whereas the case reported today is classified as a primary case although there is ongoing investigation to determine possible high risk exposures including contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness.

During the month of August 2016 through today (26 Aug 2016) there have been a total of 7 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV. Five of these 7 cases were classified as primary cases and 2 were classified as secondary cases, one in a household contact and the other healthcare acquired in a healthcare worker.

A map showing the locations of these 2 newly reported cases can be found at the source URLs.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -- Thailand
-------------------------------------------------------------------
On 30 Jul 2016, the Ministry of Public Health, Thailand, announced a laboratory-confirmed case of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) in an 18-year-old Kuwaiti man who arrived in Thailand on 25 Jul 2016 with his family.

The patient developed symptoms on 25 Jul 2016 during a flight from Kuwait to Bangkok. On 26 Jul 2016 he sought medical treatment at a hospital in Bangkok. Although there was no history of direct contact with camels or with a suspected human case of MERS-CoV infection, he had a history of travel in the Middle East in the previous 14 days. On 28 Jul 2016, he tested positive for MERS-CoV in 3 separate laboratories.

He was then referred and admitted to an isolation ward in the national referral hospital for infectious diseases.

The patient's condition rapidly improved and 2 subsequent laboratory tests on 31 Jul 2016 and 1 Aug 2016 returned negative results for MERS-CoV from 4 reference laboratories. Specimens collected from his family contacts were also negative. Contact tracing showed no evidence of infection in identified contacts.

The patient was discharged from hospital and left Thailand with his family on 4 Aug 2016.

WHO risk assessment
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has caused severe human infections resulting in high mortality and has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans especially in health care settings with the potential to lead to large-scale outbreaks. Nevertheless the risk of human-to-human transmission is low if adequate infection prevention and control measures are taken.

Infection with novel coronavirus is an emerging disease in humans. Imported MERS CoV cases had been reported in Thailand before (June 2015 and January 2016). The source of infection is most likely outside of Thailand. Exported cases have been detected in the past in several other countries.

WHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restriction be applied on Thailand based on the information currently available for this event.

WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to animals or animal products (for example, following contact with dromedaries) or human source (for example, in a health care setting). The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.

[The above confirmation of the earlier reported then supposedly ruled out case in a Kuwaiti visitor to Thailand exemplifies the risks of being dependent upon 3rd party sources of information -- in this case media reports. There were 3 media reports that discussed this case during the period 31 Jul 2016 through 5 Aug 2016. In the final report above, re-reading the earlier media reports, there was some ambiguity suggesting that repeat testing was negative -- now clearly referring to the individual no longer having active virus detected after initial tests confirmed the illness. I clearly misinterpreted the media reports and declared this a non-case, when in fact it was a mild case who resolved fairly quickly with no further virus detection (see MERS-CoV (89): Saudi Arabia (MD), Thailand ex Kuwait NOT 20160805.4395219, MERS-CoV (88): Saudi Arabia, Thailand ex Kuwait 20160802.4388931, MERS-CoV (86): Thailand ex Kuwait, RFI 20160731.4382012). I apologize for all of the confusion I may have created at the time.

Since April 2012 there had been a total of 4 cases including 2 deaths reported to WHO from Kuwait. From the above description, there is a subtle suggestion that this newly reported case in Thailand from Kuwait may well have travelled outside of Kuwait within the Middle East during the 14 days preceding onset of illness.

Again, Thailand is to be commended for the rapid response to a suspected case of MERS-CoV infection and adequate infection control procedures preventing nosocomial spread of the virus.
