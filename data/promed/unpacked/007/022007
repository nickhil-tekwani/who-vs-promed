Final test results have confirmed bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE) in a mature cross-bred beef cow from Manitoba. The Canadian
Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) is conducting a comprehensive
investigation.
Officials have confirmed the animal was purchased by the owner as
part of an assembled group of cattle in 1992. This means that the
animal was at least 15 years of age and would have been born well
before the 1997 introduction of Canada's feed ban. As a priority,
investigators are attempting to locate the birth farm, which will
provide the basis needed to identify the animal's herd-mates and feed
to which it may have been exposed at a young age. Given the animal's
age, investigative efforts may be constrained by few surviving
animals and limited sources of information, such as detailed records.
A calf born to the affected animal in 2004 is also being traced.
The safety of Canada's food supply remains protected through the
removal of specified risk material (SRM) from all cattle slaughtered
for human consumption. SRM are cattle tissues that have been shown in
infected cattle to contain concentrated levels of the BSE agent. This
measure is internationally recognized as the most effective means to
protect the safety of food from BSE. On 26 Jun 2006, the CFIA
announced regulatory enhancements to Canada's feed ban, which further
strengthen the animal feed system.
The detection of this case demonstrates the ongoing effectiveness of
Canada's surveillance program, which targets cattle most at risk of
BSE. Based on the over 115 000 animals tested since Canada's 1st case
in 2003, the CFIA is confident that the level of BSE in the national
cattle herd is very low.
