The Nodular Dermatosis [outbreak of Lumpy Skin disease] has not yet passed, and Mat shows another cattle disease. It is about Anthrax, for which the 1st case was noted.

According to "Balkanweb", the case was recorded in the village Frankth of the Komsi Administrative Unit in the Municipality of Mat. Immediately after that, residents urgently sought the vaccination of their cattle.

Meanwhile, the veterinarian of the Veterinary Service at the Agriculture Office Mat, Selman Kurti, said that this case was confirmed by the Veterinary Institute. He added that this disease is caught by humans by consuming meat [of affected animals].

Recently, residents of the area faced Dermatosis Nodular [Lumpy Skin] disease, which caused major damage to the area's farmers. After this disease disappeared, the farmers were compensated by the government with imported cows.

But an outbreak of acute disease has again appeared and has caused the 1st death, namely to compensatory cattle given to the farmers who had been affected by Nodular Dermatosis.

The case was recorded in the village of Frankth of the Komsi Administrative Unit in the Municipality of Mat. Residents insist that the state vaccinate the other cattle.

Meanwhile, the veterinarian of the Veterinary Service at the Agriculture Office Mat, Selman Kurti, said the case was confirmed by the Veterinary High Institute. Kurti said the disease is also contagious to humans in 2 forms, affecting the infected bovine and consuming his flesh. Starting from this he appealed to farmers to instantly notify instances if they have unexpected bouts of cattle.

Because this disease has affected an imported animal, specialists associate this with their weak immunity in the country.

[Livestock anthrax is sporadically reported in Albania so it is not unlikely that both the village livestock and the compensation animals are unvaccinated and with a low immunity. Transporting the compensation animals would have stressed them and reduced their innate resistance.

Mat District (Albanian: Rrethi i Matit) was one of the 36 districts of Albania (which were dissolved in 2000) that is now part of Dibër County. It is named after the Mat River that flows through the district. It had a population of 48 803 [2] (2010 estimate), and an area of 1029 sq km [approx. 400 sq. mi]. Its capital was Burrel. Mat is in north central Albania; for Wikipedia, see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mat_District.
