South Australians have been warned that the risk of transmission of potentially deadly mosquito-borne diseases in the state is at its highest level in a decade.

According to South Australia (SA) health authorities, conditions in the upcoming summer are shaping up to be similar to those in 2010/11 when the deadly Murray Valley encephalitis virus was last detected in humans and high numbers of the endemic Ross River virus were reported.

Andrew Vickers, SA Health's manager of health protection programs, said that with La Nina conditions set to remain until at least February [2021], the only way for South Australians to guarantee their safety was to prevent mosquito bites.

"The current forecast is a little bit weaker than those conditions in 2010," he said. "This season, we need to give people information on how they can protect themselves from getting bitten, because there are no vaccines or cures for the viruses we get through mosquitoes. The only way to prevent getting infected is to prevent getting bitten."

SA Health has an existing control plan that assesses the risk for a season based on the weather forecast and data from mosquito surveillance programs from stage one, which is standard risk, to stage 3 when there is a high risk of viruses being transmitted to humans.

Vickers said that the 2020/21 season started at stage 2 but that it could be raised to stage 3 if a human contracted a mosquito-borne disease.

"Mosquito bites are more than a nuisance; they can give you diseases, and those diseases can be nasty and prolonged or potentially fatal," he said, "so prevent breeding of mosquitoes locally, wear the appropriate clothes, avoid going into mosquito-prone areas at dawn and dusk, and use the repellents that are known to work."

[The is the 2nd recent warning of the threat posed by the La Nina-related change in weather conditions resulting in increased wet weather, increased vector mosquito conditions with increased virus transmission over a broad geographical area in Australia. The 1st warning was for southeast Queensland state (see Ross River virus - Australia (02): (QL) 20201126.7974690), and now the warning is for South Australia state.

Ross River virus [RRV] transmission has already been active in Australia this year (2020) with 2128 human cases. The threat of an oncoming wet season creating more extensive vector mosquito breeding sites is of legitimate concern. Infections occur sporadically across Australia when rains are heavy. RRV infection cases occur at times in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, and Western Australia. Murray Valley encephalitis virus occurs across Australia, but human cases are sporadic to rare, but can be severe. Wet weather can result in extensive breeding sites for vector mosquitoes.

Making preparations to deal with an increase in vector mosquito populations is prudent as well as informing the population of possible increased risk of infection with advice to avoid mosquito bites. People present in these areas should heed the warnings and take precautions given by health officials should these viruses be found in mosquitoes, sentinel chickens, or should human cases occur. - Mod.TY
