As many as 17 children of a family fell ill after consuming castor oil seeds, mistaking them for almonds, and were rushed to a hospital in Ratlam district of Madhya Pradesh on Friday [4 Dec 2015].

The children, hailing from Gharad village on Indore road, were admitted to the government children's hospital in Ratlam, official sources said.

One of the victims told the police that his grandmother and aunt offered castor oil seeds to them, mistaking them to be almonds, when he returned from school on Thursday [3 Dec 2015] evening. He shared them with his friends playing in the playground. The children started vomiting and felt drowsy late in the night.

Family took them to the block medical officer, who called for ambulance and referred them to Ratlam.

Civil surgeon Dr Anand Chandelkar said the entire village is being surveyed to check if any other child has eaten the seeds too. However, no such case other than these have been reported.

Admitted children are out of danger, he added.

[Castor beans, from the Castor oil plant (_Ricinus communis_) sometimes used in traditional therapies, contain ricin, among the most toxic substances known. It may cause an acute and potentially fatal gastroenteritis in addition to neurological and ophthalmological lesions. Poisoning may also lead to delayed visceral damages; however, the latter is quite rare. The toxicity is dose related and depends on the amount of castor beans ingested. There is no specific treatment, and symptomatic management to reduce the load of the toxin needs to be initiated quickly and early when a case of poisoning is suspected, so that serious complications will be avoided. Increasing the awareness of the population to the dangers of ricin would be a way to avoid the utilisation of castor seeds in traditional therapies.

Oral toxicity is generally not quite as severe as inhalation of the ricin. The beans are oblong and light brown, mottled with dark brown spots. The seed is only toxic if the outer shell is broken or chewed. The seeds of the castor bean plant may be swallowed without cracking the outer husk of the seed and pass safely through the body. However, as the children thought they were almonds, they likely cracked the seeds in the process of consuming them. The GI system responded by producing vomiting.

It is noteworthy that the oil extracted from the bean does not contain the toxin.

Ricin is a protein toxin (toxalbumin). Toxicity results from the inhibition of protein synthesis, but other mechanisms are noted including apoptosis pathways, direct cell membrane damage, alteration of membrane structure and function, and release of cytokine inflammatory mediators.

The castor bean plant also contains another glycoprotein lectin, the Ricin communis agglutinin, which, unlike ricin, is not directly cytotoxic, but does have affinity for the red blood cell, leading to agglutination and subsequent haemolysis. Ricin communis agglutinin is not significantly absorbed from the gut and causes clinically significant haemolysis only after intravenous administration.

Symptom onset after ingestion is usually within 4 to 6 hours but may be as late as 10 hours. Initial symptoms are nonspecific and may include colicky abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, heartburn, and oropharyngeal pain. The mention of drowsiness in the night may have been only because of the hour of onset, as it is not a clinical sign of ricin ingestion.

Nevertheless, we are glad to learn the children are doing well.
