Animal health experts inspected a farm in the 2nd Surrey foot and mouth
disease [FMD] zone 3 times before discovering traces of the disease,
although livestock had been suffering from symptoms for more than 10 days,
it emerged on Wednesday [19 Sep 2007].
The finding at a farm known officially as IP5 indicates that FMD may have
been present in the animals prior to the discovery of an outbreak at
another farm near Egham, 10 miles (16 km) from the original outbreak in
early August [2007].
Controls were placed around the site of another suspected case of the
disease reported on Wednesday [19 Sep 2007] near Solihull in the West
Midlands. If tests prove positive it will be the most serious development
yet. However, there have been false alarms in various regions amid a state
of high alert.
The discovery that IP5 cattle and sheep, which were culled as a precaution
a few days ago, were found to have been showing clear symptoms of FMD was
"very concerning", said David Catlow, president of the British Veterinary
Association. Some of the animals bore lesions characteristic of the
disease, some of which had healed over, indicating they were probably more
than 10 days old.
The infected animals were part of a small herd of about 50 cattle and sheep.
Mr Catlow said: "This creates increased uncertainty. To find these lesions
that are 10 days old or more suggests there may be undisclosed disease, and
the potential for spreading it."
The government's report on how the disease spread will be published on
Friday [21 Sep 2007]. Debby Reynolds, chief veterinary officer, urged
farmers to check their animals at least twice a day for signs of illness,
rather than once as is standard.
The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said the disease had
gone unnoticed at IP5 because lesions had healed over, making them
difficult to spot [see commentary].
Cattle and pigs are inspected for the disease, with pigs in the controlled
zone visited daily and cattle every other day. Sheep are given blood tests.
Peter Ainsworth, shadow environment secretary, said, "The fact that these
animals were infected at the time the government was giving the UK the all
clear is extremely alarming."
Angus Collingwood-Cameron, north east England director of the Country Land
and Business Association, said the export ban was causing difficulties for
farmers because sheep were mainly traded in September. "For some people
it's the only time of year when they get any income," he added.

The foot and mouth virus could linger for months in autumn conditions, a
leading specialist said today [20 Sep 2007], in a warning that puts further
pressure on the government to order vaccination of livestock against the
disease.
Colin Fink, a virologist from Warwick University, said the virus could
survive for "a very long time in cool conditions." He gave the warning
ahead of the release of a government report on how the disease spread from
Pirbright to Egham.
Speaking to BBC Radio's Farming Today, Dr Fink said: "The longer they wait
and vacillate about vaccination, the more this is going to become
entrenched. We have a major problem because without the sunshine to destroy
the virus in the field, we're going to have the virus around for a long time."
The Soil Association told Guardian Unlimited that the government appears to
be "on the brink" of launching a vaccination programme. "If there's one
more case outside the protection zone, I expect they will vaccinate," said
Phil Stocker, the association's head of food and farming. "The longer this
goes on, the stronger the evidence gets for vaccination."
The government's Institute for Animal Health at Pirbright, the suspected
source of the July [2007] leak of the virus, has said it can now test for
foot and mouth in an hour using a technique "analogous to the home
pregnancy test."
Mr Stocker said this added to the argument for vaccination rather than
precautionary culls. "The unnecessary slaughter of healthy cattle is
abhorrent. They are on the brink of changing policy, but they don't seem to
be able to make a decision." On Tuesday [18 Sep 2007], the chief vet, Debby
Reynolds, repeated that vaccination was being "kept under constant review."
The government is believed to be reluctant to vaccinate because of EU
export rules and pressure from farmers. Meat from countries where there has
been foot and mouth vaccination is banned for export for 6 months. But
culling only invokes a 3 month ban.
Mr Stocker said: "The farming industry is not as hostile as it was to
vaccination, but I would not be surprised if there are elements lobbying
against it. If the government sticks to the science [as it has pledged to
do], they will vaccinate now and not bow to pressure from industry."

A Temporary Control Zone has been put around one premise in the Catherine
de Barnes area of Solihull. This is a precautionary measure. An assessment
of clinical symptoms by Animal Health veterinary staff has been carried
out, and laboratory test results are awaited. At this stage disease has not
been confirmed. We will be working closely with DEFRA (UK Department for
Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs) and up to date information will be on
our website.
The following restrictions are now in place:
- no animals are to be moved within, into, or out of the Control Zone
- at this stage all footpaths within Solihull remain open. We would however
ask the public to sympathise with the concerns of farmers, and avoid using
footpaths within the Control Zone until further notice.

[In view of the possibility that FMD had gone unnoticed at IP5 in spite of
several clinical inspections, the possible application of rapid pen-side
test for FMD deserves to be seriously considered.
