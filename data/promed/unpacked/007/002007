Legionnaires' disease outbreak kills two
An investigation has started into an outbreak of legionnaires' disease
which has killed two people and left three others ill, health officials
have said. Checks were being carried out on buildings in the Culverhouse
Cross area of Cardiff in a bid to trace the source of the outbreak.
Health officials have so far failed pinpoint the cause of the cluster of
cases, which started nine months ago. A spokeswoman for Bro Taf Health
Authority - which is conducting the investigation along with the Vale of
Glamorgan Environmental Health Department - confirmed that two people have
died as a result of the outbreak.
Three other people who have been struck down with the bacteria have since
made full
recoveries.
