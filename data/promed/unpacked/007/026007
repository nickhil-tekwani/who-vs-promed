[The preliminary serological diagnosis is still to be definitely
confirmed, preferably by the culturing of the bacterium and its phage
typing. With 314 cattle already slaughtered, this may have been
achieved by now; information will be helpful. - Mod.AS

If they don't already have a vaccination program using a marked strain
(such as RB51) then they need to start one. It can be very effective
in controlling and ultimately eliminating this disease. - Mod.TG]

[With several (unspecified number) cattle already slaughtered, this
may have been achieved by now; information would be helpful. - Mod.AS]

[Viti Levu is the largest island in the Republic of Fiji. Its eastern
part is included in the Central Division and it's western part in the
Western Division of the island nation. Viti Levu can be seen on the
HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at
