A new bacterium (_Pantoea stewartii_ subsp. nov.) has been detected on pawpaw at a non-commercial property at Wyndham in Western Australia.

The bacterium was discovered via routine surveillance activities by the Australian Government's Northern Australia Quarantine Strategy (NAQS) team. The Consultative Committee on Emergency Plant Pests has determined that there is currently insufficient information to determine whether this pathogen is an Emergency Plant Pest.

The Department of Agriculture and Food, Western Australia (DAFWA) is also investigating whether this new bacterium poses any risk to commercial pawpaw production and whether it has other host species.

The trees where the bacterium was detected showed damage to leaves only, consisting of brown lesions with a yellow halo; these lesions are one to 5 centimeters wide with an irregular margin.

As a precautionary measure, DAFWA will remove and destroy the trees [and] will continue to survey non-commercial pawpaw trees in the area to determine whether the bacterium is present elsewhere. Pawpaw growers are reminded to be vigilant to signs of this bacterium.

[The genus _Pantoea_ belongs to the family of _Enterobacteriaceae_, which also comprises genera pathogenic to humans or animals. However, the majority of its members are plant-associated. Species in the genus can affect a number of crops, including cereals, pineapple, onion and citrus.

_P. stewartii_ subsp. _stewartii_ causes Stewart's wilt on maize, an important disease in parts of the USA and Europe. It is transmitted by and overwinters in the corn flea beetle (_Chaetocnema pulicaria_), but can also be seed-transmitted at a low rate. The insect vector is mostly responsible for local spread, while infected seed is considered the main route of long distance spread and, therefore, a quarantine risk.

To assess its potential impact on papaya production and biosecurity, it will be important to determine whether the new subspecies is spread in similar ways. In addition to direct seeding, papaya may also be propagated vegetatively, and transplants from infected stock would certainly pose a risk of spreading the bacteria.
