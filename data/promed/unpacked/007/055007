Health advisory: _E. coli_ O157:H7 outbreak in Whatcom County, Washington
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Whatcom County Health Department (WCHD) in Bellingham is investigating an outbreak of Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ O157:H7 infections. The Washington State Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are assisting with the investigation. Disease investigators are now calculating case counts based only on lab-confirmed infection with _E. coli_ O157:H7, rather than including suspect and probable cases. As a result, the official case count is lower than previously reported and will be adjusted regularly as the investigation proceeds.

As of 2:00 PM PDT, 15 May 2015:
- 20 people are confirmed cases.
- No one has died.
- 9 people have been hospitalized.
- 4 people have developed hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS).
- Illnesses in several other people are under investigation.

All of the ill people attended the Milk Makers Fest between 21 and 23 Apr 2015 at the Northwest Fairgrounds in Lynden; helped with the event between 20 and 24 Apr 2015 or were close contacts of ill people associated with the event. Most of the ill people are children, including older children who helped with the event. More than 1000 primary school children from all school districts in Whatcom County attended the event on these days.

WCHD is working with community health care providers to identify cases, and interviewing patients and their parents to investigate the source of the outbreak. The source investigation involves collecting information from interviews and from clinical and environmental laboratory tests. A common source or sources has not been determined. Health officials expect that it will take several more weeks to collect and analyze the information. Even if a common source is not identified, potential risk factors will be identified, which will provide information that may reduce the risk of an outbreak in the future.

The outbreak appears to be over; however, the investigation into the source of the infections is ongoing. Secondary cases (people who become ill after contact with a person with _E. coli_ infection) may be reported. It's important for people infected with _E. coli_ or those with a family member infected with _E. coli_ to follow these precautions:
- Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water immediately after using the restroom or changing a child's diaper.
- Wash your hands before and after preparing food for yourself and others.
- Stay home from school or work while diarrhea persists; most people can return to work or school when they no longer have diarrhea. Special precautions are needed for food handlers, health care workers, and child care providers and attendees. Check with your employer before returning to work, and check with your child's child care center before resuming child care.

The family of a Lynden teenager is looking for answers after he contracted _E. coli_ leading to kidney failure. The Whatcom County Health Department is trying to figure out what caused he and 44 others to fall ill after a dairy festival in Lynden.

The teenager described how he helped set up a maze in this dairy barn before the Milk Makers Fest in April 2015. "We were to pick up hay bales and set them up in a certain way for a map for a maze," he said. As a reward for their work, he and the rest of the Lynden High School Ag Tech class were fed donuts in the very same barn. He said the hand washing stations were not turned on. He found only a pump of hand sanitizer.

"Just the one hand sanitizing station that was on a pole that, as I said before, was empty," he said. The next day the 15-year-old fell ill.

"He came home from school and complained he had a really bad headache," said his mother. Soon he passed blood and started vomiting. Finally in the hospital doctors told his family he had contracted _E. coli_.

[It is interesting that no further information regarding the epidemiology of this outbreak and source of the _E. coli_ O157 has been reported. It is important to note that the teenager who was one of the 1st cases was involved before the petting zoo and was in contact with the hay for the hay maze. An incubation period of 1 day, if correct, suggests a large inoculum and suggests that the hay itself was grossly contaminated.
