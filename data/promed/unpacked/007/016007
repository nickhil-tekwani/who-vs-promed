TIGER MORTALITY, ZOO - CHINA
============================

In January, eleven tigers in the Shanghai zoo fell ill with an unidentified
virus [Do we know it's a virus if they haven't identified it yet?- Mod pc].
Three Siberian and six South China tigers were among the affected animals.
These species are on the World Wildlife Foundation's most endangered list.
Military experts at China's Veterinary Medicine Research Center suspect
this disease to be linked to a canine virus.
Is this a mutation of a previously known virus? Could it be parvovirus in a
new form doing damage to Felidae?
