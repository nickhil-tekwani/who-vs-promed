US conservation group to help save rare Zebra
-----------------------------------------------
Santiago Zoo, an American wildlife conservation group, has given
funds to 2 northern Kenya-based civic authorities to combat a deadly
anthrax outbreak in the world famous Samburu/Shaba wildlife
conservation area threatening the rare and endangered Grevy's Zebra.
The Grevy is the largest of all the zebras, and it is an endangered
species. Like all horses, it eats mainly grass and lives in the dry
desert regions and open grasslands of southeastern Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia.
The US conservation group, according to a senior game warden in
charge of Isiolo County Council, Mohammed Tubi, has disbursed over 40
million shillings (USD 556 000) to be used to vaccinate the rare
species in game reserves located in Isiolo and Samburu districts.
"The funds will be used to vaccinate 1500 zebras starting Wednesday
[15 Feb 2006]," Turbi told PANA on the telephone from Isiolo, 324 km
north of Nairobi, on Sunday [12 Feb 2006].
The Zebra species is the only type found in northern Kenya's tourist
circuit, which includes Shaba, Samburu and Buffalo Springs game
reserves. 15 of the species have succumbed to the deadly anthrax over
the past month, mostly in community-based wildlife sanctuaries in
Samburu district. Samburu council senior game warden Abdi Boru said
the deaths occurred in areas managed by Namunyak Wildlife
Conservancy, which is under the Isiolo-based Lewa Downs Wildlife
Conservancy. Both officials said no Grevy's Zebra had died inside the
parks but raised concern over the safety of the animals under the
care of the councils, as well as livestock, from the threat of anthrax.
Tubi said stakeholders from the region, which include the 2 civic
authorities and the Lewa Downs Wildlife Conservancy, met on Thursday
[9 Feb 2006], and the vaccination campaign was discussed.

[In East Africa, as elsewhere, there is a long ongoing tension
between National Parks and foreign tourist money and the surrounding
villages with their livestock and grazing needs. When these villages
profit directly from the eco-tourists, it becomes more
straightforward. I hope that a part of the funding can go to the
Samburu Council to cover the costs of vaccinating the local cattle as
well. If cattle die from anthrax, the problem merely continues to
afflict the Grevy another day. Senior Game Wardens Mohammed Tubi and
Abdi Buru are correct in their concerns. The 1st Grevy deaths were
noted in December 2005 and were followed by human cases in January
2006, which have continued. In southern Kenya, there are presently
serious problems involving the Masai and the Tsavo National Park
thanks to the severe drought and lack of cattle grazing; see
