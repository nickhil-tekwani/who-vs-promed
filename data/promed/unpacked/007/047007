[The WRLFMD has genotyped during 2015, 3 batches received from Saudi Arabia, reporting close similarity to the Turkish strain G-VII above. They are available on the Turkish page at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/me/sau.htm, titled as follows:

WRLFMD batch no. // Date received // Type // Virus isolates // Topotype // Lineage
WRLFMD/2015/00025 // 15 Sep 2015 // A // SAU/1/2015&SAU/2/2015 // ASIA // G-VII
WRLFMD/2015/00028 // 19 Sep 2015 // A // SAU/3/2015 & SAU/4/2015 // ASIA // G-VII
WRLFMD/2015/00029 // 23/10/2015 // A // SAU/5/2015 & SAU/6/2015 // ASIA // G-VII

In the introduction to the recent (September 2015) 'Global monthly FMD disease situation report' of EUFMD, the guest editor, Dr Donald King, Head of WRLFMD, The Pirbright Institute, UK, commented:
"Over the past 2 years, laboratories within the OIE/FAO FMD Network have been closely monitoring the emergence and spread of the O/ME-SA/Ind2001 strain in North Africa (Libya, Tunisia, and Algeria) and the Gulf States of West EurAsia (Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain). Sequence data show that this viral lineage originates from the Indian sub-continent, although the precise transmission routes by which the virus has "escaped" the regions where it normally circulates are not well understood. From a positive perspective, no new FMD outbreaks due to this lineage have been reported since the cases in Algeria earlier this year (in March and April 2015). ---- continued vigilance in these regions is essential to ensure that any new cases are quickly identified. In another related development, recent clinical samples sent to the WRLFMD from cattle in Saudi Arabia have been characterised as serotype A, most closely related to FMD viruses from India. These new cases further substantiate the epidemiological links between countries in the Indian sub-continent and the Gulf States, and raise questions regarding the performance of vaccines that are currently deployed into countries in endemic Pool 3 (West EurAsia)." The monthly report is available at http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/eufmd/docs/FMD_monthly_reports/2015/September_2015_def.pdf.

The comment above was written prior to the emergence of FMDV serotype O in Morocco and the FMDV serotype A in Turkey; those recent developments render it an even stronger impact.

The concerns about the possible introduction of Indian field strains, against which no matching vaccines are available in other parts of the world, have recently been illuminated by Russia's ban on the import of buffalo meat from India, allegedly "after its observers found FMD virus in a consignment" (see ProMED-mail 20151008.3699496). ProMED-mail's request for information on the identity of the tests performed and on the FMD virus strain allegedly identified, are pending. India's exports include large quantities of Hallal (permissible according to Islamic law) buffalo meat. Most of the buffalo meat is exported either as chilled or frozen carcasses or as fresh or frozen bone-in and boneless cuts, with Viet Nam, Malaysia, Egypt, Thailand, and Saudi Arabia being the main destinations. See more at http://www.thecattlesite.com/news/48467/india-sees-sharp-rise-in-exports-of-livestock-products/#sthash.bOtGFvRV.dpuf.

Boneless meat is regarded safer, in terms of potential FMD contamination, than bone-in meat.

In view of the spread of the Indian serotype A virus westwards in Turkey, the need for a matching vaccine becomes urgent. It is anticipated that such (tested) vaccines become available soon. - Mod.AS
