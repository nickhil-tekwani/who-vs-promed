Villagers attacked by rabid wolf
--------------------------------
The Rosselkhoznadzor [Federal Service for Veterinary and
Phytosanitary Surveillance] office in Bryansk and Smolensk oblasts
has implemented quarantine regulations in the village of Brakhilovski
in the Klimovski region of Bryansk oblast. This is in response to an
incident when a wolf severely bit a man and attacked 9 other people
in the village.

A reference laboratory confirmed that the wolf was rabid.The persons
bitten by the wolf are currently receiving post-exposure rabies
prophylaxis, together with rabies and tetanus immunoglobulins, and
are under observation in the regional hospital.
