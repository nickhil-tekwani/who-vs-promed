Outbreak of Chagas disease in Caracas
-------------------------------------
according to a report issued by the Venezuelan Medical Scientific Societies Network in their last Epidemiological Alert bulletin, a new outbreak of Chagas disease occurred at the end of March [2012] in Caracas.

To date there are only 4 confirmed cases that acquired the disease in Mercado de Coche [market], presumably after drinking watermelon juice, but this has not been completely verified, declared Dr Ana Carvajal, an infectious diseases specialist and member of the aforementioned network.

All 4 patients have satisfactorily responded to medical therapy. Another 2 cases are still considered as "suspicious", while waiting for additional tests.

Dr Carvajal pointed out that transmission in these cases was by the oral route and not because of the bite of an insect vector, as is the usual occurrence in Chagas disease. "Vectorial transmission is the most frequent route of transmission for this disease. That is, if a bug bites a person and it defecates on the skin, then the person scratches himself/herself, and stools of the insect are introduced in the skin. This is the most frequent transmission route. However, in these 4 cases transmission was by the oral route, after the ingestion of foods (watermelon juice) contaminated with stools from bugs", explained Dr Carvajal.

In these cases, she added, symptoms may me more intense: high fever, weakness, malaise, and leg edema, and also inflammation in the site of the bug bite if there is vectorial transmission of Chagas disease.

Dr Carvajal pointed out that for preventing this disease the main strategy is for the Ministry of Health to issue alerts informing the population about this new outbreak so that appropriate measures may be taken.

She also recommended the fumigation of areas infested with bugs, placing wire meshes in doors and windows, and use of insect repellents and long sleeved shirts and pants.

She also pointed out that people must be very careful when drinking fruit juices and fresh vegetables and fruits must be thoroughly washed.

[Foodborne outbreaks of Chagas disease (South American trypanosomiasis caused by _Trypanosoma cruzi_) have been increasingly reported from South America over the past decade. The largest ever reported outbreak took place in Caracas in 2007, with at least 128 verified cases and probably more undiagnosed cases. This outbreak was probably caused by fresh guava juice. - Mod.EP
