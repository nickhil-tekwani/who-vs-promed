Anthrax suspected in Myanmar Cattle (Kachin State) RFI
------------------------------------------------------
March has brought with it the dreaded Anthrax in Burma's northern
Kachin State capital Myitkyina. The disease has been killing cattle
since early this month. Heads of cattle owned by people [in]
Myitkyina died within 24 hours after they revealed symptoms where the
foot trembled, reports in the Myanmar media in exile said. According
to veterinary doctors the symptoms of Anthrax are fever, swelling
leading to death in animals like sheep and cattle. The disease can be
passed on to humans. This has created panic among residents of the
capital of Kachin State in Myanmar.

The Myanmar regime, however, for possibly the 1st time reacted with
some alacrity sending in veterinary doctors and staff to tackle the
disease. The veterinary teams are injecting anti-Anthrax vaccines
into cattle in villages in and around Myitkyina. Unlike anything that
the junta usually does this time, however the veterinary team is
visiting each village for the vaccination with the help of village
administrative offices, reports added. The junta authorities are,
however, going about tackling the disease quietly. It has made no
public announcement about the disease neither has it bothered to warn
people not to sell meat of cattle dying from Anthrax in local
markets. Locals believe that the disease has spread due to weather
changes in the state. Farmers in villages are worried stiff and are
praying that the regime can control the spread of the disease. They
are apprehensive of their cattle dying of Anthrax because many depend
on cattle for farm activities like ploughing paddy fields and other crops.

Not confirmed information!

[The true level of this disease in Myanmar is hard to determine as it
under-reports and only retrospectively attempts control, as in this
report, which itself is unsubstanciated as yet. According to OIE
during the period 2005-2007 multiple human cases occured ("+") but
actual numbers were not given. Livestock ouitbreaks occurred in
cattle, sheep and pigs; in 2006 there were 7 bovine outbreaks which
involved some 93 animals. In 2002 there was an outbreak in wildlife
in which 95 animals were affected but of unknown species. The
frequency that anthrax infected animals out of Myanmar turn up in
Thai border villages suggests that the disease is widespread.

If anyone has access to more substantive reports than this Earth
Watch one, it would be appreciated if they would share them with us.
This is the 1st report of anthrax we have had ex-Myanmar and while we
do not suspect it to be disinformation, confirmation would be appreciated.

Kachin State is the northernmost state in the country, tucked between
China and India. Myitkyina is at the end of the south-north railway
line. It was the site of intense fighting during WWII. An
