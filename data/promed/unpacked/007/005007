report 20110924.2887
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This posting fails to mention that bats appear to be the primary
vector for spread of WNS [white nose syndrome], as evidenced by
WNS-associated mortalities in caves and mines that are inaccessible to
humans due to permanent gating. Caves that have not been visited by
humans, as recorded on electronic monitors, have become positive for
_Geomyces destructans_.

Large geographical jumps of WNS (such as from Europe to the US and
from New England to West Virginia) do strongly implicate humans as
fomites, but do not rule out the role of the bats themselves. To point
to human traffic within caves as a means of pathogen spread, while
omitting what many scientists, biologists, and responsible cavers
believe to be the primary means of spread, does not relay the full
scientific story and propagates misinformation by omission.

[Dr Viner makes a great observation. I appreciate my sharp eyed
readers and their time to make comments.

Sadly, the report makes no mention of bats being their own vector. The
report and Dr Viner's observations help to highlight how much we do
not know about this disease. - Mod.TG]
