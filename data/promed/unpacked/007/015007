Recombinant forms of HIV spreading globally
-------------------------------------------
NEW YORK: Newly identified recombinant forms of the human immunodeficiency
virus type 1 (HIV-1) are being spread to diverse geographic regions,
investigators report, which could have implications for the development of
an AIDS vaccine. Dr Martine Peeters, of the Laboratoire Retrovirus in
Montpellier, France, and colleagues characterized the genome sequences of
isolates from an individual in Senegal and one in Mali. As they report in
the Journal of the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes for 15 Apr 2002 [J
Acquir Immune Defic Syndr 2002; 29: 522-30], the 2 isolates matched 2
others described in patients from Burkina Faso and Mali. All 4 isolates
comprised a mosaic genome structure that included fragments from HIV
subtypes A, G, K, and J. They matched isolates previously described in
patients from Burkina Faso, Mali, Ivory Coast, and Nigeria. On the basis of
newly proposed nomenclature, the strains are designated CRF06-cpx. The
strains have also been isolated from patients in France and Australia,
indicating global spread. Dr Peeters' group notes the importance of seeking
biological differences among subtypes and circulating recombinant forms and
tracking their molecular epidemiology; "because recombination may introduce
genetic and biological consequences that are far greater than those
resulting from the steady accumulation of single mutations." It remains to
be seen how viral recombination will affect viral properties, such as host
viral loads and drug resistance, the researchers suggest.
In another report in the same issue of the journal [J Acquir Immune Defic
Syndr 2002; 29: 536-43], Dr Rafael Njera of the Instituto de Salud Carlos
III in Madrid, Spain, and colleagues detail the characterization of the
first reported recombinant to originate in western Europe. Its genome is
made up primarily of subtype G, with the extracellular portion subtype B's
env. They propose the designation CRF14_BG. The researchers also note that
a parental non-recombinant subtype strain has been isolated in the same
area, implying that the recombinant virus was most likely generated locally
in northwestern Spain or in Portugal. They postulate that sources of the
G-subtype viruses are fishermen infected by contact with prostitutes in
sub-Saharan Africa or immigrants from former Portuguese colonies in Africa.

[In the past ProMED-mail has not posted information on HIV or AIDS, and
will continue to exclude reports relating to the prevalence, treatment, and
prevention of AIDS. We do, however, post a few reports on the epidemiology
of HIV that impinge on the spread and evolution of HIV and HIV-associated
disease. Currently HIV-1 is classified into 3 major groups: M, N, and O.
Group M, which encompass the global spread of HIV-1 and comprise several
subtypes or clades designated A to H that have appeared in different
geographic settings. The papers referred to above record genetic
interaction between these subtypes and the apparent evolution of new
genotypes of as-yet-unknown disease-producing potential. - Mod.CP]
