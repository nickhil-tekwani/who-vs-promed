Another death has been attributed to the largest Legionnaires' outbreak in Ohio history this morning [30 Jul 2013], and health officials said they have concluded water tests and found the source of infection. The outbreak, which as of today [30 Jul 2013] has killed 5 and sickened 35, was caused by the potable water and air-conditioning cooling tower at Wesley Ridge Retirement Community in Reynoldsburg, [Ohio], said Franklin County Public Health spokeswoman Mitzi Kline.

Kline said the retirement community has gone "above and beyond" in taking precautions to protect its residents, staff and visitors.

The county, along with state and federal health officials, has worked with Wesley Ridge to stem the outbreak for 3 weeks. The retirement community has hyper-chlorinated its water once and superheated it twice. After the 1st effort, trace amounts of _Legionella_ bacteria were found in the Parkside building.

As of today [30 Jul 2013], water restrictions are lifted in all buildings except Parkside. Showering restrictions will be lifted if showerheads approved by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are installed or clean tests come back. Residents aren't supposed to drink or cook with water until negative results come back.

The cooling tower is closed until a long-term prevention plan is in place, according to the county.

[There are currently at Wesley Ridge Retirement Community 35 individuals ill with Legionnaires' disease, and 5 have now died. Wesley Ridge Retirement Community, with about 225 residents and about 10 in adult daycare, offers independent and assisted living, skilled nursing, long-term care, and rehabilitation services, inpatient and outpatient dementia care, and hospice care in a variety of building types on a campus in suburban Reynoldsburg, Ohio (http://www.wesleyridge.com/services#sthash.U8bzQfz6.dpuf). Reynoldsburg, with a population of 35 893 in 2010, is a suburb of Columbus, the capital of and largest city in the U.S. state of Ohio. _Legionella_ have apparently been isolated from both the potable water and air-conditioning cooling tower. The news report above does not give results of genotyping of environmental and clinical isolates. - Mod.ML
