Rocky Mountain spotted fever is hitting Grayson County hard. A total of 26 cases were reported to the Grayson County Health Department in just 11 days. The tick-borne illness causes a painful rash and flu-like symptoms such as fever, chills, headache, nausea, abdominal pain, body aches, and lack of appetite.

Grayson County has been the leading county in Kentucky for reported cases since 2016, but doctors said they're seeing more cases in 2019 than ever before. "If you do think you have any type of symptoms, it never hurts to get checked out," said Ben Williams, an emergency room doctor at Twin Lakes Regional Medical Center. "It's always better to be overcautious than under cautious."

Local doctors and the health department want to spread awareness. "Be proactive with your health, and increase your awareness of tick-borne illness prevention to protect yourself, your family, and your pets," said Rebekah Lee, a registered nurse with the Grayson County Health Department. "A local veterinary clinic has been involved in efforts to collect ticks and send to an outside lab for further testing. Many of those tick samples have returned positive for tick-borne disease."

"Treat your yard, if you can," Williams said. "It's not too expensive to do so, and it will help prevent the spread of illnesses." Williams said parents should check children and pets around their hairlines, behind their ears, and in other hidden spots after playing outside. "Make sure [children] take a shower or bath within the 1st couple hours of getting in there," he said. "Make sure you get their clothes off and inspect the child."

Health department officials said the illness hasn't killed anyone in Grayson County. "It is possible for this to be fatal, but rare," Lee said. "Grayson County has not received reports of fatalities associated with any tick-borne illness. However, it's seriousness widely varies among individuals from mild to severe symptoms."

Healthcare professionals also said it's a good idea to cover up when walking through grassy and wooded areas and to use bug spray to prevent serious illness.

[When a female _Dermacentor_ tick harboring the organism attaches to a passing human, she usually starts low on the body after transferring from grassy vegetation or even directly or indirectly from a dog. After crawling around on clothes, seeking an appropriate cutaneous site (wearing white clothes makes a wandering tick easier to spot), she attaches and begins to feed. If the tick is not already partially fed, after attaching it generally takes 24 hours to activate and transmit the rickettsial organism. For this reason, daily or twice-daily tick checks with removal will minimize disease transmission. Ticks that attach in hairy areas such as the scalp or beard may be more difficult to find.

Given the short feeding time that occurred here, it is more likely that another, unnoticed, tick exposure was the source.

The presenting illness is generally nonspecific: fever, muscle pains, and headache (which is usually described as quite severe). The rash begins on day 3 of the illness, initially maculopapular at the wrists and ankles before becoming petechial and purpuric, involving the palms and soles as well as spreading proximally to the trunk. Purpura usually is not seen before the 6th day of illness. The mortality is indeed quite low if treatment (usually a tetracycline) is begun during the 1st 2 days of the rash or before.

Empiric treatment for this infection should always be begun in people with compatible symptoms inhabiting endemic areas during the spring and summer, even if no tick bite is known.

Delayed diagnosis contributes to morbidity and mortality of Rocky Mountain spotted fever [RMSF], as it may have here. A tetracycline represents the best drug for treatment, even in children. Practicing infectious diseases in western Wisconsin as I do, we see many cases of tick-borne disease this time of year. Although RMSF is uncommon, tetracycline is also used for borreliosis, anaplasmosis, and ehrlichiosis and is often begun empirically before diagnostics are available. - Mod.LL
