Dangerous Influenza virus Strain Shipped Worldwide in Error
-----------------------------------------------------------
A dangerous strain of influenza virus that caused a worldwide pandemic in
1957 was sent to thousands of laboratories in the United States and around
the world, triggering a frantic effort to destroy the samples to prevent an
outbreak, health officials revealed yesterday. Because the virus is easily
transmitted from person to person and many people have no immunity to it,
the discovery has raised alarm that it could cause another deadly pandemic
if a laboratory worker became infected, officials said. As a result, health
authorities were urgently working to make sure all samples are destroyed and
to closely monitor anyone who may have come into contact with the virus for
signs of illness, officials said.
"This virus could cause a pandemic," said Klaus Stohr, the World Health
Organization's top influenza expert. "We are talking about a fully
transmissible human influenza virus to which the majority of the population
has no immunity. We are concerned." Although no infections have been
reported, and the chances of infection are probably low, the potential
consequences are so grave that urgent steps were necessary, he said. "If a
laboratory accident were to occur, a person could become infected. If that
happened, that person would likely fall ill and he or she could infect
somebody else. And that could mark the beginning of a global outbreak,"
Stohr said. WHO is working with the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta and other national health agencies to contain the
situation, he said, adding that "the level of concern about this virus is
very high."
The virus, known as an H2N2 strain, killed 1 million to 4 million people
worldwide in 1957 and 1958, including about 70 000 in the United States.
Because the virus has not circulated in the wild since 1968, anyone born
after that would have no natural immunity to it. Since then, the virus has
been kept only in high-security biological laboratories. The problem arose
when a private company, Meridian Bioscience Inc. of Cincinnati, sent a panel
of virus samples to about 3700 laboratories, some in doctors' offices, to be
tested as part of routine quality-control certification conducted by the
College of American Pathologists. An additional 2750 laboratories, all in
the United States, received the samples as part of other certification
processes and were asked to destroy them, CDC spokesman Dan Rutz said. The
panel samples usually include only strains of influenza virus that are
relatively benign, Stohr said. "We would consider this an unwise and
unfortunate decision," he said.
The 3700 samples were sent out beginning last fall, primarily to labs in the
United States, although 14 were in Canada and 61 were in 16 other countries,
Stohr said. "The people who are handling this are extremely experienced in
dealing with potentially dangerous pathogens, and we have no reason to
believe that there were any breaches," Rutz said. "But there's always a
concern about a virus to which a sizable part of the population has no
immunity, and we're interested in seeing to it that it's neutralized as
quickly as possible."
The mistake came to light March 25 when the National Microbiology Laboratory
in Winnipeg, Manitoba, identified the virus. "They were doing this routine
testing and identified this virus ", Rutz said. Canadian officials notified
WHO and the CDC on Friday. "We have requested that additional measures be
taken --- that the laboratories have to acknowledge receipt of the message
in written form, to confirm that they have destroyed any of these samples,
and that they would monitor their laboratory staff for any respiratory
disease," Stohr said.
Robert G. Webster, a flu expert at St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital
in Memphis, called the incident "a terrible, terrible mistake. I have been
telling WHO for a number of years that this is a dangerous virus that is
still out there in more labs than they know," he said. "This may alert WHO
and Homeland Security and whoever wants to know that each and every H2N2
sample from 1957 needs to be rounded up and locked down."
Neither the College of American Pathologists nor Meridian Bioscience was
aware that the virus being shipped was the deadly 1957 strain, said Jared
Schwartz, a pathologist and spokesman for the college. The college asked the
company to ship a type A strain of virus, he said, and Meridian's paperwork
indicated that this strain was benign. "For reasons I don't understand and
Meridian doesn't understand, the documentation they had was incorrect," he
said, adding that the source of the mislabeling was unclear. Meridian may
have obtained the strain from another company that had misidentified it, he
said. Even had Meridian known it was the deadly H2N2 strain, Schwartz said,
current federal guidelines would have allowed the company to ship it. He
said that neither the college nor the company was aware CDC was considering
whether to reclassify the strain as too deadly to ship. Schwartz said a
mechanism is being established to require anyone shipping pathogens to
notify the CDC about what strains of virus are involved.
William J. Motto, chairman and chief executive of Meridian Bioscience, said
he had no comment last night.

E-alert 13 April: Worldwide laboratory distribution of influenza A/H2N2
virus similar to 1957-58 pandemic strain, labs asked to destroy all samples
immediately
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
An influenza A/H2N2 virus, similar to that which caused the 1957-8 influenza
pandemic has been inadvertently distributed in proficiency panels for
quality control assessment to at least 3686 laboratories in Canada and the
United States, and 61 laboratories worldwide, the World Health Organization
announced on 12 April [1]. The distribution occurred between October 2004
and February 2005.
The A/H2N2 virus concerned, A/Japan/305/57 H2N2, is the same strain of virus
that circulated during the 1957-58 influenza pandemic. The pandemic strain
was highly transmissible among humans, and continued to circulate in humans
causing annual epidemics until 1968, after which time it vanished. An A/H2N2
virus is not included in current trivalent influenza vaccines, and it is
thought that people born after 1968 have no immunity to A/H2N2 infection.
The virus was identified by a local laboratory in Canada and reported to the
Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC, http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca), which
informed WHO on 26 Mar 2005. The PHAC immediately initiated appropriate
biosafety measures and respiratory surveillance and traced the source of the
virus to a panel of proficiency testing samples distributed by the College
of American Pathologists (CAP, http://www.cap.org). This information was
passed to WHO and the United States Department of Health and Human Services
(HHS) on 8 Apr 2005. HHS has since learnt that additional A/H2N2 samples were
sent to additional laboratories in the US by other proficiency testing
providers.
On 8 Apr 2005, the CAP, at the request of the US government, contacted all
laboratories participating in the proficiency testing and asked them to
destroy all samples containing A/H2N2 virus. On 12 Apr2005 the CAP further
asked all the laboratories to send confirmation of the destruction, and to
investigate and notify national authorities of any respiratory disease seen
in laboratory staff. WHO has the addresses of all laboratories involved and
has passed these on to the relevant ministries of health, requesting their
collaboration.
The European Early Warning and Response System (EWRS) [2] today issued a
level 2 alert to the competent public health authorities in the EU, with the
information currently available from WHO. The European Commission is in
permanent contact with the member states concerned and WHO and is following
the situation closely.
The European Influenza Surveillance Scheme (EISS, http://www.eiss.org/) has
today issued an urgent questionnaire for all laboratories participating in
the Community Network of Reference Laboratories for Human Influenza in
Europe [2], with guidance. All laboratories in this network can detect the
A/H2N2 virus, but only 38% (12/32) of them currently have the reagents
available to identify the H2 subtype of the virus [2]. EISS is working with
laboratories to improve the detection of potential pandemic viruses,
including A/H2N2 viruses [2].
Based on virus detection, there have so far been no reports of any A/H2N2
infections in laboratory staff associated with this sample distribution.
When proper biosafety precautions are taken, the risk of laboratory-acquired
influenza infections is greatly reduced and the likelihood of any infections
in these staff and the general public is low.
WHO recommends that all proficiency panel specimens containing A/H2N2 be
destroyed immediately, and that biosafety procedures for influenza viruses
that are no longer circulating in humans be reviewed.

received virus samples:

[Seroarchaeology suggest that H2N2 serotype influenza virus was the
predominant human influenza virus just prior to 1900. In 1900 the
predominant serotype became H3N8. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that a
serotype H1N1 virus of avian origin then became predominant, infecting both
humans and pigs, and spreading from America to Europe with troop movements.
This virus was probably responsible for the Spanish influenza pandemic of
1918. The Asian influenza pandemic of 1957 was caused by an H2N2 serotype
virus, which carried three genes (PB1, H2 and N2) derived from feral
waterfowl and the remaining five genes from the human H2N2 influenza virus.
The previously predominant H1N1 strain disappeared simultaneously with the
appearance of the pandemic H2N2 strain, a circumstance not yet adequately
explained. The virus responsible for the Hong Kong influenza H3N2 pandemic
of 1968 probably acquired two genes (PB1 and H3), again from wild ducks,
while retaining the six other genes of the circulating human influenza
virus. Coincident with the appearance of the H3N2 virus, the H2N2 virus
disappeared, again a circumstance not adequately explained. Later, in 1977, a
Russian H1N1 serotype strain that had been present in the 1950s reappeared
and has remained in circulation together with H3N2 serotype virus since
that time. (For a fuller account of this interpretation of the epidemiology
of human influenza, see: Webster RG and Kawaoka Y, Semiminars in Virology 5,
103-111, 1994.)
As a consequence of these events the majority of the global human population
has not been exposed to H2N2 serotype virus and lacks immunity to infection.
Hence the urgent need to recall or destroy the samples of H2N2 serotype
virus apparently distributed in error as a diagnostic standard for human
influenza A virus. An unresolved issue, discussed in previous ProMED-mail
posts, is whether antibodies to the N2 component of influenza virus might
provide some degree of protection sufficient ameliorate the effects of H2N2
virus infection. - Mod.CP]
