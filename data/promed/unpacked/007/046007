"The Big Itch ... Rains produce worst mosquito outbreak in Southeast Texas
in more than 20 years" (the headline), by Allan Turner
Selected edited comments include:
"First came the rains, then the floods, then the clouds of mosquitoes
so thick that in some parts of coastal Texas, breathing outdoors at dusk is
nearly impossible ...
In parts of Houston, where two cases of
mosquito-transmitted St. Louis encephalitis have been confirmed, an exposed
human arm will attract 30 to 50 mosquitoes in a minute ...
In Angleton, Brazoria County Agricultural
Extension Agent Bochat said a number of young calves had died from inhaling
mosquitos. And adult cattle also are suffering."
Harris County's Parsons (Ray
Parsons, director of the Harris County Mosquito Control District) noted that
researchers counted insect landings. The rate ranged between 30 and 50
landings per minute. And even five landings a minute is deemed uncomfortable
... In Beaumont, mosquito control director Chastant (Lee Chastant, director
of the Jefferson County Mosquito Control District) reported mosquitos so
thick it was necessary for him to wear a bandana over his mouth and nose in
order to mow his lawn ... "
The complete article is quite lengthy, discusses efforts to control (adult)
mosquitoes by spraying, and touches on efforts at Texas A&M University "to
launch research into genetically altering mosquitoes to eliminate their
blood lust", Olson said.
