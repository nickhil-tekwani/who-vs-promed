--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The term acute encephalitis syndrome [AES] was coined by the WHO in 2008 and since then it has become very popular. The government of India has endorsed it on the official website.

WHO has been promoting syndromic diagnoses for a variety of conditions, but this one, AES, has led to death due to misdiagnosis in many children. Such a diagnostic term to cover acute encephalitis (mostly viral such as JE, herpes simplex, West Nile), acute encephalopathy (mostly biochemical and non-infectious, such as hypoglycemic encephalopathy, heat hyperpyrexia, Reye syndrome), pyogenic meningitis (pneumococcal or _H. influenzae_ b, occasionally _N. meningitidis_), cerebral complications of systemic diseases (scrub typhus, leptospirosis, chikungunya), TB meningitis, viral meningitis, cerebral malaria, brain abscess, etc., is not only unscientific but also unethical as it condones lack of further investigations, even a lumbar puncture.

When clusters of cases are reported, the disease is taken as JE without protocol-based investigations. Acute encephalopathy and scrub typhus also may occur in clusters.

I had repeatedly condemned this shortcut diagnostic term, which I declare is not a diagnostic term at all. Each child with brain fever (translation of 'chamki buckar') deserves an etiology-specific diagnosis, and the term AES is better avoided in clinical practice.

[Dr John is thanked for his insightful comments. His concern about the imprecision of AES as a diagnosis is justified.

In many previous reports, statements are made that preventive measures for AES are, or will be, taken. The many possible etiological agents linked to AES that Dr John mentions above would require different preventive measures or treatments. Without knowing the specific etiological agent involved, prevention is uncertain and treatment is guesswork.

Dr John's declaration that AES, "is not a diagnostic term at all. Each child with brain fever (translation of 'chamki buckar') deserves an etiology-specific diagnosis, and the term AES is better avoided in clinical practice." should be heeded. - Mod.TY
