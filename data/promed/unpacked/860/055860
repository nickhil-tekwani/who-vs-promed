From: Glen Otto <gotto@leland.Stanford.EDU>

The necropsy findings reported in the 1981 paper that was cited DO fit
with
substantial blood loss, i.e., extreme pallor of the mucous membranes,
little
blood evident on tissue dissection, and the presence of watery,
unclotted
blood in the major vessels. "Exsanguination" is a misnomer if, as the
recent
report suggests, animals are dying with hematocrit values above 25%.
It's
interesting to speculate on the potential blood loss from a massive
feeding,
but it seems more likely that the deaths are due to the cumulative load
of
biologically active peptides the mosquitoes are introducing into the
system.
What I'm questioning is the suggestion in the current discussion that a
hematocrit of 25-28% is associated with irreversibility of the syndrome.
If
that is truly the case, than something other than blood loss must be
involved at early stages.
The JAVMA paper calculates an estimated 5000 bites per minute would be
required to account for the blood loss observed, and in my mind that
represents an opportunity for significant amounts of tachykinins and
other
salivary components to be introduced. Perhaps the moderate decrease in
hematocrit observed is a marker of the stage where animals become
"envenomated" to the point that they can no longer effectively resist
which
is followed by overwhelming and fatal feeding.

I had asked Glen to provide details as to what should be looked for in a
moribund animal or at necropsy to differenciate between blood loss and
"envenomation" from biologically active peptides/tachykinins.
Unfortunately
he was unable to. Maybe one of our members can.
We calculated, roughly, that these bulls were losing some 45L of blood.
If
one assumes that the ratio of mosquito blood meal to saliva is c. 20:1,
then
the bulls acquire some 2.25L of mosquito saliva in the time that that
they
are acutely exposed, say 36 to 40 hours. Thus Glen's hypothesis of
"envenomation" may well be contributory or even causative.
Talking with one of our pathologists, he commented that such loss of
blood,
in his experience, in such a short time would not be compensated and
could
lead to anemia & ischemia, and thus the escape of bacteria and
endotoxins
from the GI tract with damage to the micro-circulation. This will
produce
characteristic lesions in the liver, kidneys, and heart; with petechial
&
ecchymotic hemorrhage, and perivascular hemorrhage; in the kidneys there
will be tubular and endostitial tissue damage and leakage; in the liver,
congested sinusoids with a centrilobular pattern. (If my notes of what
he
said are correct. Any errors are mine.)
