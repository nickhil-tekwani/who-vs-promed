Positive Case of CWD Found in Oneida County Deer
Mandatory Testing Protocols Find CWD in a Captive White-Tailed Doe
-------------------------------------------------
The 1st positive case of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in New York State
has been confirmed in a white-tailed doe from a captive herd in Oneida
County. CWD is a transmissible disease that affects the brain and central
nervous system of deer and elk. There is no evidence that CWD is linked to
disease in humans or domestic livestock other than deer and elk.
The animal that tested positive for CWD was a 6-year-old white-tailed doe
that was slaughtered from a captive herd in Oneida County as part of the
State's mandatory CWD surveillance and testing protocols. Preliminary
tests performed at the New York State Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory at
Cornell University determined the presumptive positive, which was confirmed
late yesterday by the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa.
The New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets has officially
quarantined the index herd in which the positive deer was found, and will
depopulate and test all deer on the premises. Other herds associated with
the index herd have also been quarantined and an investigation has been
initiated to find and test any susceptible deer that came into contact with
the index herd and to assess the health and environmental risks associated
with such establishments. The Department of Environmental Conservation
(DEC) will conduct intensive monitoring of the wild deer population
surrounding the index herd to ensure CWD has not spread to wild deer.
CWD is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) of deer and
elk. Scientific and epidemiological research into CWD is ongoing. To
date, research shows that the disease is typified by chronic weight loss,
is always fatal, and is transmissible between susceptible species. CWD has
only been found in members of the deer family in North America, which
include white-tailed deer, mule deer, elk and moose.
CWD has been detected in both wild and captive deer and elk populations in
isolated regions of North America. To date, CWD has been found in
Colorado, Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico,
Oklahoma, South Dakota, Utah, Wisconsin and Wyoming in the United States,
and in Saskatchewan and Alberta in Canada.
Establishing the known CWD health status of captive and wild cervid
populations is a critical component for controlling CWD. In New York, the
responsibility for controlling CWD is shared between the State Department
of Agriculture and Markets, DEC, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's
(USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS).
New York's cooperative, active surveillance program serves as a model for
the nation in CWD control. The State Department of Agriculture and Markets
monitors the health and movement of all captive deer and elk for the
presence of common livestock diseases, including CWD. In July 2004, the
Department initiated the CWD Enhanced Surveillance and Monitoring Program,
which requires captive deer and elk herd owners to take various actions,
including routine sampling and testing, animal identification and an annual
herd inventory. Since the inception of testing for CWD in 2000, 681
captive deer and elk have been tested and found negative for CWD.
DEC issues licenses to individuals who possess, import or sell white-tailed
deer. DEC also routinely tests New York's wild deer population. Following
the discovery of CWD in Wisconsin, DEC implemented a statewide surveillance
program in April 2002 to test wild white-tailed deer for the presence of
CWD. Samples are collected and sent to an approved USDA laboratory for
analysis. To date, DEC has taken samples from 3457 wild white-tailed deer,
including 40 from the county where the positive deer was found. All samples
from wild white-tailed deer have tested to date have been negative for CWD.
DEC will also implement precautionary regulations limiting transportation
and possession of whole carcasses and some parts of wild deer taken near
the location of the captive herd. These regulations will be similar to
those currently in place for importation of carcasses and parts of deer
into New York.
DEC has also implemented regulations restricting various activities to help
control CWD within the State, including restrictions on the importation of
live deer and elk, deer feeding, importation and possession of certain deer
parts and carcasses, and transportation of deer and elk carcasses through
New York State.
USDA APHIS supports individual State programs by providing funding for CWD
prevention and surveillance. USDA APHIS reimburses states conducting CWD
testing on their wild and captive cervid population and also provides
indemnification dollars for captive herds that must be destroyed due to the
presence of CWD.
New York State has 433 establishments raising 9600 deer and elk in
captivity. In the wild, DEC estimates there are approximately one million
deer statewide.

[This is the 1st time CWD has been found in New York State. This is a blow
to the NY cervid industry. Undoubtedly, in addition to the actions
identified in the press release, NY will be examining how the positive deer
came to be in New York State. Was the animal imported from a previously
positive region? Was this a case of spontaneous disease? The officials will
be conducting a very thorough investigation. - Mod.TG]
