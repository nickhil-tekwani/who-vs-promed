[The situation in Kyrgyzstan was best described by Jalalidin Gaibulin, Director of the Centre of Quarantine and Dangerous Infections, Ministry of Health, Kyrgyz Republic in January 2009 (see ProMED-mail post 20090130.0415):

"Most cases were recorded in the Jalal-Abad region [province] with Osh, Batken, and Chuy provinces next in the ratings. This bad situation is connected with the high number of [historic] ground foci of anthrax. Altogether in the republic, 1234 such places have been registered, with 485 foci in Chuy province; 354 foci in Jalal-Abad province; 247 foci in Osh province; 124 foci in Issyk-Kul [Ysyk-Kol] province; 23 foci in Talas province; 5 foci each in Naryn and Batken provinces; and 1 focus in the city of Bishkek.

The main reason for this ongoing situation is incomplete vaccination coverage of livestock. The inhabitants also facilitate the situation. They slaughter animals without veterinary inspection and sell the meat of sick animals at markets. So, not only the people who slaughtered the animals and contracted the disease, but also sellers and customers, are at risk. The effective measure is compensation for slaughtered animals. But the question now is not resolved."

According to OIE, there were outbreaks in Chuy in 2005, 2007 (cattle and a saiga), and 2008, and human cases in 2005 (1), but the latter are seldom identified as to oblast (province). The recent seeming absence of outbreak reports out of Chuy could be for many reasons, but possibly most likely they were being missed or just silently added into the national data.
