Researcher healthy 21 days after Ebola accident
-----------------------------------------------
A researcher who may have been exposed to the deadly ebolavirus was
declared healthy and released from isolation at a German hospital
Thursday [2 Apr 2009], having been spared the horrific symptoms of the disease.

The woman had accidentally pricked her finger 3 weeks ago [12 Mar
2009] with a needle used to inject Ebola into mice. It was not known
if the virus actually entered her bloodstream, but she was given an
experimental vaccine just in case. The vaccine had never been tested
on humans. Scientists don't know if the vaccine saved her or if she
was simply lucky not to get the disease during an excruciating 21-day
waiting period. "The patient is healthy. We're happy about that,"
said Dr Stefan Schmiedel, who attended to her at a Hamburg hospital.

Doctors said they would now study her immune response for evidence of
whether she actually contracted the virus, and whether the vaccine
helped her defeat it. "It's possible we'll never know with 100
percent certainty," said Dr Stephan Guenther, head of the Bernhard
Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg, where the woman worked.

On 12 Mar 2009, the unidentified 45-year-old nicked her finger
through 3 layers of protective gloves while working on lab mice
injected with the ebolavirus. In the hours after the accident, an
international group including virologists and biologists held a
telephone conference to brainstorm a strategy that might save her
life. Among several risky options, the team chose the experimental
vaccine, and within 48 hours it was sent from a lab in Canada and
injected into the woman. Hours later she developed a headache, muscle
pain, and a fever -- symptoms that passed quickly and did not return.

"We believe she's overcome everything," Guenther said. "It's been 3
weeks. That's a very conservative estimate for Ebola." Guenther said
scientists will analyze the woman for antibodies in an attempt to
determine whether they came solely from the vaccine or whether she
was generating others, signaling that she had been infected. "The
vaccination only contained [proteins capable of inducing] antibodies
against surface Ebola proteins. If she was building antibodies to
other proteins, then they must have stemmed from a true infection,"
Guenther said. She may not have contracted Ebola at all. Though the
needle stuck her, the plunger of the syringe was not pushed, so it's
not certain the virus entered her bloodstream.

Ebola hemorrhagic fever, seen mostly in Africa, is one of the world's
most feared diseases. It begins with flu-like symptoms, followed by
bloody diarrhea and vomiting. Days later, some victims begin bleeding
through the nose, mouth, and eyes. Depending on the strain of virus,
it can kill up to 90 percent of victims. So far, there is no cure.
The virus is spread through direct contact with the blood or
secretions of an infected person. There are 2 other known accidents
involving researchers who came into direct contact with a similar
strain of Ebola. A Russian researcher died, and a British scientist
became ill but survived.

[This incident appears to have had a favourable outcome and the
patient has at no time displayed symptoms of ebolavirus infection.
Hopefully this is now the end of this story.

Analysis of the patient's immune responses should determine whether
she sustained a productive infection (by the presence of antibodies
to the non-structural proteins of ebolavirus not present in the
experimental vaccine), and to what extent the experimental vaccine
was amplified by determination of the titre of antibodies to the
vesicular stomatitis virus components of the vaccine. Such analysis
might indicate to what extent the fever experienced by the patient
was no more than a response to vaccination. - Mod.CP]
