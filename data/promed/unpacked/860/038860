The patient who was diagnosed with extensively drug resistant (XDR) tuberculosis [TB] in Daru, Western Highlands Province [Papua New Guinea], has died. This was confirmed by Western Provincial TB Health Physician, Dr Stenard Hiasihri. News of his death was shared in the Special Parliamentary Hearing into the health management of PNG [Papua New Guinea], this week in Port Moresby. "The patient died, because we had to wait for the medicine to come from overseas," Dr Hiasihri said.

Dr Hiasihri told the inquiry, multi drug resistant [MDR] TB cases continue to increase since detected in 2008. 249 cases recorded in 2014 was an indicator of a high rate of person-to-person transmission. "As of November 6 this year [2015], 102 new cases have been registered for treatment with 39 percent as primary cases," he said.

The TB Program has identified 3 phases to improve, strengthen, and address the epidemic as outlined in the Provincial TB Strategic Plan and Accelerated Response Plan. In order to effectively and efficiently address this epidemic, Dr Hiasihri said that funding and additional resources are immediately required.

Daru is the epicenter with transmissions of primary cases occurring both on Daru Island and communities along the coastline from Fly River delta to Mabudawan in the West.

Dr Hiasihri said that clinical response so far has been coordinated well but not sufficient. There's need for additional health workers.

Meanwhile, Mabudawan Village in South Fly District, shares a border with Australia and Indonesia. This wetland is only accessible through sea transport. It is one of Papua New Guinea's neglected villages, which hasn't received much assistance from the National and Provincial Government's. According to Community Health Worker, Naidi Magau, most of the assistance comes from the Australian Government, because it's under the treaty villager. "Because we are neglected, most times, our patients are referred or served at Saibai," she said.

In May this year [2015], EMTV visited Mabudawan with the Special Parliamentary Committee On Public Sector Reform and Service Delivery on a Fact Finding Mission. Health service delivery is relatively poor. Every day is a struggle, with lack of funds for health patrols, medical equipment like labour beds, a run-down building, no vaccinations, electricity, or water supply.

There are growing concerns tuberculosis could become untreatable in Australia after a dramatic increase in the number of drug-resistant tuberculosis cases recorded in Papua New Guinea [PNG]. A parliamentary inquiry in Papua New Guinea has been looking into the country's crisis involving multidrug resistant [MDR] tuberculosis (TB). TB Specialist Dr Stenard Hiasihri told the hearing it is increasing at an alarming rate.

"There is a real epidemic in Western Province [of Papua New Guinea]. The numbers have been increasing since 2012," he said. "Last year [2014], we had 84 cases, and this year we have 103 so far. And next year [2016] we'll have new cases, the trend is increasing." That is despite tens of millions of dollars in Australian aid being invested into the Pacific nation to tackle the epidemic.

MP Gary Juffa questioned the PNG government's response to the almost incurable strain of the disease. "There seems to be no urgency, there seems to be no anxious effort, no concern almost," he said. "There's almost a sense of apathy in addressing this. I mean we should be containing this as quickly as possible."

Patients of the drug-resistant TB used to be treated at clinics in the Torres Strait. But the inquiry was told the decision by the Australian government to relocate treatment clinics back to the PNG mainland has had an impact. "A country that used to help us is Australia. We just moved them across to Saibai and they helped us because they know our situation. They're willing to help us," said one official.

World Vision chief executive Tim Costello said the situation also raises concerns about how AUD 60 million [about USD 43.25 million] in Australian aid is being spent in combating the disease. "We obviously have some political situations with PNG. We know about Manus Island, we know about somewhat greater autonomy the PNG government has over the aid we give them because of that political deal," he said. "They are all questions politicians have to answer about the effectiveness of our aid."

Western Province is one of the epicentres for drug-resistant TB. It lies along the border with Australia. Hundreds of people make that crossing near Far North Queensland every day. Just a few years ago the disease crossed into Australia and claimed 2 lives. Tim Costello said the situation cannot be ignored. "PNG is our nearest neighbour, the nearest point just 8 kilometres [5 mi] away, so this issue is one we need to take incredibly seriously," he stressed.

In a statement, federal Department of Health said health officials are working closely with the Australian government to monitor and control TB activity in Queensland.

The Department said Australia also has robust border controls and screening processes in place.

[Papua New Guinea (PNG), with a population of over 7 million people, gained its independence from Australia in 1975 and is now a Commonwealth with Queen Elizabeth II as its Sovereign and Head of State. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea). It occupies the eastern half of the island of New Guinea and its offshore islands in Melanesia in the southwestern Pacific Ocean north of Australia. The western half of New Guinea forms the Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Papua. PNG's capital is Port Moresby, located along its southeastern coast. The majority of the PNG's population lives in traditional societies and practices subsistence-based agriculture (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea). PNG has 20 provinces, the Autonomous Region of Bougainville and the National Capital District. Each province is divided into one or more districts.

Daru, located on an island located near the mouth of the Fly River with a population of 13 000, is the capital of the Western Province of Papua New Guinea (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daru). Daru is just north of Torres Strait and Far North Queensland, the northernmost part of the state of Queensland, Australia.

The Torres Strait Islands Treaty signed by Australia and PNG allows for free movement of people (without passports or visas) between the Torres Strait Islands and PNG for traditional activities. The Torres Strait Islanders, who are culturally akin to the coastal peoples of PNG, became citizens of Queensland, Australia in 1967 with full access to health and social services and freedom to travel and work in Australia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islanders). Many thousands of Torres Strait Islanders are said to live in Queensland today.

ProMED-mail previously reported on a 20-year-old woman from Papua New Guinea (PNG) who had been hospitalized in Queensland in an isolation ward in 2012 and who died in 2013 with XDR-TB (extensively drug resistant TB). She was said to be part of an ongoing TB epidemic in PNG on Daru Island. ProMED-mail had also posted news reports on this case in 2012 and 2013 (Tuberculosis - Australia: (QL) ex Papua New Guinea 20121020.1355085 and Tuberculosis - Australia: (QL) ex Papua New Guinea, XDR, fatal 20130318.1591289).

The annual incidence of TB in PNG is estimated to be 233 per 100 000 population, and TB is one of its 3 leading causes of death (http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/188_03_040208/gil10334_fm.html). As a point of reference, according to the US CDC, the annual incidence of TB in the USA in 2011 was 3.4 cases per 100 000 population (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6111a2.htm). Of 60 patients living in the Western Province of PNG who sought treatment between 2000 and 2006 in the Torres Strait Islands because of limited access to health care in the Western Province of PNG, 15 (25 percent) were found to have multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB).
