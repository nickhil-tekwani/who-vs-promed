Inclusion body hepatitis in Bolivia
---------------------
(Disease never reported before in Bolivia).
Emergency report
Translation of information received on 2 Jan 2003 from Dr Marcelo Lara
Godoy, National Head of Animal Health, Servicio Nacional de Sanidad
Agropecuaria (SENASAG), Trinidad:
Report date: 30 Dec 2002.
Nature of diagnosis: clinical with laboratory confirmation.
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 30 Dec 2002.
Outbreaks:1
Location No. of outbreaks
Santa Cruz district, 43 km from Santa Cruz city 1 farm
Description of affected population: farm of heavy breeding poultry imported
from another country.
Diagnosis: the clinical and histopathological diagnosis of inclusion body
hepatitis in 24-day-old chickens was carried out because the farm's
mortality rate increased and samples were obtained and sent to the
laboratory as part of the farm epidemiological surveillance system.
SENASAG, as the official body, also sent samples to the LIDIVET laboratory,
which confirmed the disease.
A. Laboratory where diagnosis was made: Veterinary Research and Diagnosis
Laboratory(1) (LIDIVET).
B. Diagnostic tests used: histopathological examination in which
infiltration by heterophiles, congestion, the presence of intranuclear
inclusion bodies, and areas with 6/8 parenchymatous degeneration were observed.
Epidemiology:
A. Source of agent / origin of infection: the broiler breeders chicks were
imported from another country; an epidemiological investigation is
currently being carried out.
B. Mode of spread: presumably by vertical contagion.
Control measures:
- Total destruction of the batch containing 8700 females and 1300 males.
- Reinforcement of biosafety measures.
- Further studies will be carried out on all batches imported from the
country possibly implicated.

[The cause of IBH is probably an adenovirus infection. Serotype 5 (Tipton)
has been implicated, although experimental work suggests that some other
factor, e.g. bursal damage, is required for full expression of the disease.
Co-infection with either Gumboro disease virus or chick anaemia virus (CAV)
has been postulated.
IBH was first described in broilers in the USA in 1963. Now its worldwide
distribution suggests that its incidence is increasing in many
poultry-producing areas. There have been reports of peracute infection in
New Zealand and Austrialia in broilers between 7 and 21 days of age.
The morbidity is usually low, with occasional dull, sick birds. There is a
sudden increase in mortality of up to 10 percent in broilers between 3 and
7 weeks of age. Mortality usually peaks in 3 or 4 days unless complicated
by secondary infection.
The diagnosis is made on observations of a sudden high mortality and the
postmortem findings. The post mortem findings include hemorrhages in the
skin, fat, and muscle. The liver is characteristically swollen showing
multiple petechial hemorrhages and focal necrosis. Liver histology shows
eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies. Kidneys are pale and swollen.
Bone marrow and bursal depletion may be seen.
Transmission is probably by fecal contamination of fomites such as
buildings, equipment, vehicles, and personnel. The causal agent may be
vertically transmitted.
IBH has the potential for rapid spread and high mortality in densely
populated poultry areas.
No effective vaccines are available, so control depends on biosecurity to
exclude infection from premises and prevention of spread of infection
within companies or poultry areas. Control of other contributory diseases
such as Gumboro disease and CAV are probably important.
