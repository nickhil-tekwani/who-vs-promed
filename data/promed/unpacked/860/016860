7 men were rushed to hospital Monday night [26 Jan 2009] after eating
fugu, or blowfish [or pufferfish - Mod.LL], prepared by an
inexperienced restaurant owner. The men entered the Kibunya fresh
seafood restaurant in Tsuruoka, Yamagata Prefecture, at around 7 pm,
and began complaining of a pins-and-needles sensation about an hour
later; 2 of the men are now in serious condition. A 68-year-old man
is unconscious, and another, 55, has dilated pupils and is in a dazed
state. The other 5 men, aged 61-69, have mild symptoms.

According to the restaurant owner, investigators at Tsuruoka Police
Station believe there is a high probability the men were poisoned by
the blowfish, which contains the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin. Officers
have searched the restaurant on suspicions of professional negligence
causing injury and for violations of the Food Hygiene Law.

The restaurant owner said that he prepared blowfish sashimi and
lightly grilled soft roe for the men. "I don't have a blowfish chef's
license. This was the 1st time I had served it raw," he said. "I've
never eaten it before myself, but I heard it was good, so I served
it."

Fish poisoning by consumption of members of the order
Tetraodontiformes is one of the most violent intoxications from
marine species. The gonads, liver, intestines, and skin of pufferfish
can contain levels of tetrodotoxin sufficient to produce rapid and
violent death. The flesh of many pufferfish may not usually be
dangerously toxic.

Tetrodotoxin has also been isolated from widely differing animal
species, including the California newt, parrotfish, frogs of the
genus _Atelopus_, the blue-ringed octopus, starfish, angelfish, and
xanthid crabs. The metabolic source of tetrodotoxin is uncertain. No
algal source has been identified, and until recently tetrodotoxin was
assumed to be a metabolic product of the host. However, recent
reports of the production of tetrodotoxin/anhydrotetrodotoxin by
several bacterial species, including strains of the family
_Vibrionaceae_, _Pseudomonas sp._, and _Photobacterium phosphoreum_
point toward a bacterial origin of this family of toxins. These are
relatively common marine bacteria that are often associated with
marine animals. If confirmed, these findings may have some
significance in toxicoses that have been more directly related to
these bacterial species.

The 1st symptom of intoxication is a slight numbness of the lips and
tongue, appearing between 20 minutes to 3 hours after eating poisonous
pufferfish. The next symptom is increasing paresthesia in the face and
extremities, which may be followed by sensations of lightness or
floating. Headache, epigastric pain, nausea, diarrhea, and/or vomiting
may occur. Occasionally, some reeling or difficulty in walking may
occur. The 2nd stage of the intoxication is increasing
paralysis. Many victims are unable to move; even sitting may be
difficult. There is increasing respiratory distress. Speech is
affected, and the victim usually exhibits dyspnea [shortness of
breath], cyanosis [turns blue], and hypotension [drop in blood
pressure]. Paralysis increases and convulsions, mental impairment, and
cardiac arrhythmia [alterations in heartbeat] may occur.

The victim, although completely paralyzed, may be conscious and in
some cases completely lucid until shortly before death. Death usually
occurs within 4 to 6 hours, with a known range of about 20 minutes to
8 hours.

It's so spiky you'd think it wouldn't need to be poisonous as well, to
discourage predators. I wonder how many people had to die before they
figured out how to prepare it safely to eat? Let this be a warning to
check that the restaurant you order it from is licensed to sell
pufferfish.

This is a completely different thing than what causes scombroid fish
poisoning, which is high levels of histamine, an unrelated molecule. -
