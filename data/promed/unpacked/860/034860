A new outbreak of African swine fever (ASF) has been reported in wild boar close to the boarder with Belarus. Only one case was reported in a wild boar in Straszewo, Podlaskie.

This area is under proper restrictions concerning ASF, which were established in accordance with the European Union legislation (infected area indicated in Directive 2002/60/EC).

[African swine fever (ASF) is a devastating hemorrhagic fever of pigs with extremely high mortality rates. In affected countries, it causes huge economic losses. It is transmitted by soft ticks in the genus _Ornithodorus_.

The importance of wildlife reservoirs for disease maintenance has been clearly demonstrated. In Eastern Europe, the disease spread into the local wild boar populations. Further westward or eastward spread could adversely affect the pig sector in many countries.

The ASF epidemic in Poland has been going on since February 2014. It has been resolved in domestic swine, but it continues in wild boar.

An OIE map showing all ASF outbreaks reported since the beginning of 2015 is available at http://tinyurl.com/ocdoype.
