Hantavirus is the cause of death
---------------------
After 9 days of investigations, a virology exam performed at the
Adolfo Lutz Institute in Sao Paulo detected a hantavirus that was
responsible for the deaths of 2 17-year-olds and a 24-year-old last
week in Sao Sebastiao, after they were hospitalized with generalized
body aches, nausea and vomiting. The announcement was made by the
Secretary of Health, Arnaldo Bernadina, early last night. Bernardina
discarded the possibility of the deaths of a 21-year-old resident of
Paranoa and a 5-year-old who died at the end of the week in the
Cancer Hospital in Sao Paulo, as due to the same cause. "The exams
[laboratory] were inconclusive, but ruled out hantavirus".
The disease is transmitted through inhalation of dust containing
feces and urine of wild mice. In this way, those who live in rural
zones are more vulnerable to the disease. The symptoms begin between
3 and 15 days following the infection, with respiratory or renal
manifestations.
According to Bernardina, the death last Thursday was the only one (of
the 3 who died), who lived in a rural area. "Because of this, we
were convinced that the other cases were infected outside of their
residences". According to the secretary, one week before dying, this
case went to Buraco das Araras in Formosa (GO - Goias), suggesting
the possibility of the existence of new foci of the disease in other
regions of the DF [Federal District] and Entorno.
After the diagnosis of the cause of the deaths, the work of
controlling the disease now should be assumed by the federal
government in conjunction with the local health authorities. "The
Ministry of Health has the equipment necessary for the diagnosis and
field work" explained Bernadino.
The objective now is to identify the areas at risk. According to the
secretary, in practice this means elimination of wild mice from Sao
Sebastiao. "We should not create another ecologic disequilibrium
that would lead to new outbreaks of diseases".
In addition to the deaths, 2 persons are still hospitalized under
observation, suspected of having hantavirus infection.

[This newswire confirms the diagnosis of hantavirus infection as the
etiology of this cluster of deaths. As the cluster occurred in a
close temporal period, results of further epidemiologic studies will
be interesting to see whether these individuals attended a common
event in an area where hantavirus-infected mouse droppings may have
been present. While Brasilia is now a major city, it encompasses a
large geographic expanse including ever-expanding satellite cities
into rural zones -- so that the occurrence of a more traditionally
rural disease is not too surprising. - Mod.MPP]
