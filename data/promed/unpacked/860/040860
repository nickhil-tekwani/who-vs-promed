(1) Since ProMED is an international forum, I would find it a better choice to use internationally accepted disease names. According to the WHO International Classification of Diseases 10 (ICD-10), the disease caused by ebolaviruses is called "Ebola virus disease (EVD)" and not "Ebola haemorrhagic fever" (http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2010/en#/A90-A99). EHF is certainly used a lot in the literature but mainly by people who do not get in touch with patients and simply don't know any better (i.e. do not have to classify diseases according to existing legal frameworks and therefore don't know that ICD-10 exists or how important it is). Also, the term "hemorrhagic fever" is always problematic, as its definition has not been updated since the 1960s and early 1970s (Gajdusek, Smorodintsev). Everybody seems to know what a viral hemorrhagic fever is, until you ask them and push for an answer.

[In defence of ProMED-mail, we did stress in the 1st report of the Kibaale outbreak that the disease was not haemorrhagic, but subsequently did not edit out the invariably used "haemorrhagic" descriptor. - Mod.CP]

(2) I am the current Chair of the Filoviridae Study Group of the ICTV [International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]. We have recently proposed a new taxonomic and nomenclatural framework for filoviruses in an article published in the Archives of Virology [reference and abstract appended below], which was subsequently accepted and ratified by the ICTV and published in the 9th Report of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (Academic Press 2012). Together with taxa name changes, we have also changed the virus names to make them more distinct (no confusion with species names anymore, abbreviations that don't sound alike when pronounced, etc.). Consequently, the virus that causes the current outbreak in Uganda is "Sudan virus (SUDV)", not "Sudan ebolavirus (SEBOV)". SUDV is one of 5 known ebolaviruses, 4 of which cause EVD in humans.

[Up to the present, ProMED-mail has been using the nomenclature published in the 8th Report of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. We thank Dr Kuhn for bringing attention to the revised taxonomy and nomenclature recently published in the 9th Report of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses.

The following is the reference and abstract of the paper summarising the revision of the taxonomy of the Filviridae that was subsequently ratified by the ICTV:

Reference: Arch Virol. 2010 Dec;155(12):2083-103. Epub 2010 October 30.

Title: Proposal for a revised taxonomy of the family Filoviridae: classification, names of taxa and viruses, and virus abbreviations.

Abstract:
"The taxonomy of the family Filoviridae (marburgviruses and ebolaviruses) has changed several times since the discovery of its members, resulting in a plethora of species and virus names and abbreviations. The current taxonomy has only been partially accepted by most laboratory virologists. Confusion likely arose for several reasons: species names that consist of several words or which (should) contain diacritical marks, the current orthographic identity of species and virus names, and the similar pronunciation of several virus abbreviations in the absence of guidance for the correct use of vernacular names. To rectify this problem, we suggest (1) to retain the current species names Reston ebolavirus, Sudan ebolavirus, and Zaire ebolavirus, but to replace the name Cote d'Ivoire ebolavirus [sic] with Tai Forest ebolavirus and Lake Victoria marburgvirus with Marburg marburgvirus; (2) to revert the virus names of the type marburgviruses and ebolaviruses to those used for decades in the field (Marburg virus instead of Lake Victoria marburgvirus and Ebola virus instead of Zaire ebolavirus); (3) to introduce names for the remaining viruses reminiscent of jargon used by laboratory virologists but nevertheless different from species names (Reston virus, Sudan virus, Tai Forest virus), and (4) to introduce distinct abbreviations for the individual viruses (RESTV for Reston virus, SUDV for Sudan virus, and TAFV for Tai Forest virus), while retaining that for Marburg virus (MARV) and reintroducing that used over decades for Ebola virus (EBOV). Paying tribute to developments in the field, we propose (a) to create a new ebolavirus species (Bundibugyo ebolavirus) for one member virus (Bundibugyo virus, BDBV); (b) to assign a 2nd virus to the species Marburg marburgvirus (Ravn virus, RAVV) for better reflection of now available high-resolution phylogeny; and (c) to create a new tentative genus (_Cuevavirus_) with one tentative species (_Lloviu cuevavirus_) for the recently discovered Lloviu virus (LLOV). Furthermore, we explain the etymological derivation of individual names, their pronunciation, and their correct use, and we elaborate on demarcation criteria for each taxon and virus."

In future, ProMED-mail will adopt this new terminology wherever applicable.
