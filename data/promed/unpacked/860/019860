From New York, to Virginia and now into North Carolina, 333 dolphins have washed ashore so far this summer [2013].

Testing on 32 of 33 of those animals has revealed an outbreak of a disease caused by "morbillivirus".

It's similar to the measles that occurs in humans but scientists say this outbreak poses no health threat to people.

The affected dolphins often have skin and brain lesions, along with other infections because the disease suppresses their immune systems.

"This event is frightfully similar to an event that occurred in 1987," said Charlie Potter a Smithsonian scientist. That's when more than 750 washed up along the east coast also because of the morbillivirus.

Scientists expect the outbreak to spread south and possibly last until next spring [2014].

[Viruses in the _Morbillivirus_ genus, _Paramyxoviridae_ family, are enveloped, single stranded RNA viruses known to infect 3 mammalian orders: primates, carnivores, and Cetartiodactyla (previously separated as 2 orders, Cetacea and Artiodactyla).

Several dolphin die-offs have been attributed to dolphin morbillivirus (DMV) in many parts of the world. It caused extensive mortalities in the endangered Mediterranean striped dolphins (_Stenella coeruleoalba_) in 1990 and 1991, common dolphins (_Delphinus delphis ponticus_) from the Black Sea in 1994, and bottlenose dolphins (_Tursiops truncatus_) in the Gulf of Mexico from 1987 through 1994. The virus seems to be part of the natural pathogens dolphins are exposed to. It would be important to determine which contexts and conditions determine that it causes important die-offs. - Mod.PMB]
