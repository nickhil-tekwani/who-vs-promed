Veterianarians in Svay Rieng province are set to start a campaign to vaccinate more than 400 cattle in Chantrea district against bovine pasteurellosis, with some provinces having already done so.

Pen Chanthy, head of the provincial animal health and production bureau, said the jab drive - set to begin on [8 Jun 2022] - will involve cattle yet to have been inoculated during a previous campaign. From February [2022] to [2 Jun 2022], veterinarians in the province vaccinated 2366 cattle against the disease, with 119 sick cattle having recovered.

"In this village, for example, there are a lot of cows, of which 50 or 70 were yet to be vaccinated because residents did not join the campaign," Chanthy said.

Huy Touch, head of the animal health and production bureau in Banteay Meanchey province, said that while cattle with bovine pasteurellosis had died in June [2022], the timely intervention of veterinarians had helped return the situation to normal.

He added that the province had no serious outbreak of the respiratory disease, and veterinarians would soon begin to inoculate cattle against bovine pasteurellosis after receiving vaccines from the General Department of Animal Health and Production.

"Not many of our farmers joined us in the previous vaccination campaign, and we could not force them to do so. If we try to vaccinate, they say their cattle are not ill, and they still refuse it even after we explain the situation to them. It is only when their cattle are sick that they ask for our help," Touch said.

Pen Setha, head of the animal health and production bureau in Battambang province, said on [6 Jun 2022] that he was aware of no cattle falling sick in any district this year [2022] and that his bureau had received more than 50 000 doses of bovine pasteurellosis vaccines per semester.

"We have received more than 50 000 doses of the vaccine but have more than 90 000 cattle in the province, with some residents having not taken their cattle to be vaccinated after we announced this campaign," Setha said.

In the last 6 months of [2021], agriculture officials vaccinated 26 882 cows and 116 buffalos, with 3258 cattle having been inoculated against lumpy skin disease, he noted.

[According to the media report above, the undiagnosed mortality of cattle and buffalos in the Svay Rieng province (RFI 20220605.8703699) has been diagnosed as "bovine pasteurellosis". Most likely, this is an event of hemorrhagic septicemia (HS), a WOAH-listed, highly fatal bacterial disease seen mainly in cattle and water buffalo, which is known to be endemic in Cambodia. HS results from infection by _Pasteurella multocida_ subsp. _multocida_, and only 2 serotypes of this organism classically cause HS: the Asian serotype B:2 and the African serotype E:2. Infection with serotypes A:1 and A:3, in contrast, predominantly involves pneumonia and death. Septicaemia is the main characteristic feature in all forms of the disease. In peracute cases, sudden death without clinical signs may be observed. Water buffaloes are generally more susceptible to HS than cattle and show more severe forms of the disease with profound clinical signs. In endemic areas, mortality is largely confined to older calves and young adults.

This disease can be eradicated with quarantines, movement controls, tracing of contacts, euthanasia of infected and exposed animals, and cleaning and disinfection of the premises. In endemic areas, HS is mainly prevented by vaccination. The 2 serotypes of _Pasteurella_ that cause HS do not infect humans. - Mod.AS
