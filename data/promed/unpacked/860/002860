[2] Patient management
Date: Sun 30 Nov 2014
From: Fabrice Simon <simon-f@wanadoo.fr> [edited]


To adequately manage the chikungunya [virus]-infected patients in the current outbreak in the French Caribbean islands and in French Guiana, the French Ministry of Health (Direction Generale de la Sante) asked the Societe de Pathologie Infectieuse de Langue Francaise to propose guidelines for case management at all stages. The work was conducted with some other societies (rheumatologists, general practitioners, rehabilitation) and the national reference center for arboviral diseases.

These guidelines are now available in French at :
http://www.infectiologie.com/site/_actualite_detail.php?id_actualite=455

An English version of these guidelines will be available in the coming weeks.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Simon for sending in the link to the guidelines. Having a version in English will be very helpful for patient treatment. One hopes that versions in Spanish and in Portuguese will follow quickly as well. - Mod.TY]

[3] Passive Surveillance

Arriola, DVM, PhD, Michael Johansson, PhD, Elizabeth Hunsperger, PhD, Jorge L. Munoz-Jordan, PhD, Harold S. Margolis, MD, Brenda Rivera Garcia, DVM. Chikungunya Cases Identified Through Passive Surveillance and Household Investigations -- Puerto Rico, 5 May-12 Aug 2014.

[Summary]
Chikungunya and dengue are mosquito-borne, viral, acute febrile illnesses that can be difficult to distinguish clinically. Whereas dengue is endemic in many countries in the Caribbean and the Americas, the 1st locally acquired chikungunya case in the Western Hemisphere was reported from the Caribbean island of St. Martin in December 2013 and was soon followed by cases in many parts of the region. In January 2014, the Puerto Rico Department of Health (PRDH) and CDC initiated chikungunya surveillance by building on an existing passive dengue surveillance system. To assess the extent of chikungunya in Puerto Rico, the severity of illnesses, and the healthcare-seeking behaviors of residents, PRDH and CDC analyzed data from passive surveillance and investigations conducted around the households of laboratory-positive chikungunya patients. Passive surveillance indicated that the 1st locally acquired, laboratory-positive chikungunya case in Puerto Rico was in a patient with illness onset on 5 May 2014. By 12 Aug [2014], a total of 10 201 suspected chikungunya cases (282 per 100 000 residents) had been reported. Specimens from 2910 suspected cases were tested, and 1975 (68 per cent) were positive for chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection, and 4 deaths were reported. The household investigations found that of 250 participants, 70 (28 per cent) tested positive for current or recent CHIKV infection, including 59 (84 per cent) who reported illness within the preceding 3 months. Of 25 laboratory-positive participants that sought medical care, 5 (20 per cent) were diagnosed with chikungunya and 2 (8 per cent) were reported to PRDH.

These investigative efforts indicated that chikungunya cases were under-recognized and underreported, prompting PRDH to conduct information campaigns to increase knowledge of the disease among health care professionals and the public. PRDH and CDC recommended that health care providers manage suspected chikungunya cases as they do dengue because of the similarities in symptoms and increased risk for complications in dengue patients that are not appropriately managed. Residents of and travelers to the tropics can minimize their risk for both chikungunya and dengue by taking standard measures to avoid mosquito bites.

[It is not surprising that there are many unreported cases of chikungunya virus infections. Individuals with mild or subclinical infections may not seek medical attention, and their infections go undiagnosed and unreported. There are graphs showing the epidemic curve through August 2014 and maps showing the geographic occurrence of cases by month 5 May-12 Aug 2014. - Mod.TY]
