[Since 2005, Myanmar has reported 10 outbreaks of avian influenza. They occurred in 2009 and 2010, and all but one occurred during the period from January to March. But from looking at the reporting in both animals and humans from surrounding countries such as Cambodia, Bangladesh, Viet Nam, Nepal, Bhutan, and China, it is clear that highly pathogenic avian influenza still lurks in the background and deserves our attention and surveillance.
