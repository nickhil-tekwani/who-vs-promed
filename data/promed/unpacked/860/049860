Fungal disease spreads in Indonesia's cocoa farms
-------------------------------------------------
More than 60 percent of cocoa plantations in Indonesia's main growing
island of Sulawesi have been infected with a deadly fungal disease,
which threatens output and affects quality, industry officials said
on Thursday [19 June 2008].

Vascular streak dieback (VSD) attacks leaves, branches, and trunks
and was spreading rapidly in the provinces of South, Central, and
Southeast Sulawesi which account for 75 percent of Indonesia's cocoa
output, they said.

"I believe more than 60 percent of plantations in Sulawesi have been
affected by the VSD. This is scary. Definitely output will be below
500 000 tonnes this year [2008]," said Halim Razak, chairman of the
Indonesian Cocoa Association.

Indonesia, the world's 3rd-largest cocoa producer after Ivory Coast
and Ghana, produced 520 000 tonnes of beans in 2007. Cocoa
plantations in Sulawesi cover 800 000 hectares [almost 2 million
acres].

"We've been hearing a lot more of the VSD and the quality has not
been very good. I guess output below 500 000 tonnes is very well
possible," said a dealer in Singapore.

[Vascular streak dieback (VSD) of cocoa is caused by the fungus
_Oncobasidium theobromae_, which was first identified in Papua New
Guinea in the 1960's. It is a very severe problem in South East Asia,
Melanesia, and parts of the Far East. For example, a potential crop
loss of 30 000 tonnes for SE Asia has been suggested. Symptoms on
mature trees include leaf chlorosis, defoliation, and characteristic
staining of vascular bundles at the leaf scars and infected xylem,
followed by dieback of branches and often death of the tree. VSD also
causes losses among cacao seedlings, and avocado can also be affected
by the pathogen. The rate of symptom development is closely
correlated with rainfall incidence during prior months.

The fungus is a leaf-penetrating, vascular pathogen. It may have
evolved as an endophyte on an as yet unidentified indigenous host,
before affecting cocoa and avocado, which are both crops introduced
to the region. The rate of disease spread on cocoa is limited and
very few new infections occur beyond 80 m (about 260 ft) from
diseased trees. VSD is spread mainly by wind and human activities,
transmission through seed or infected cuttings has not been
demonstrated. Strict quarantine measures applied to the movement of
intact plants are crucial in reducing spread of the disease. Disease
management requires an integrated approach including planting of less
susceptible crop varieties, cultural practices in nurseries and
plantations, as well as fungicide applications.
