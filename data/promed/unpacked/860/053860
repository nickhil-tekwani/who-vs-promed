Test results have detected the chronic wasting disease (CWD) agent in
a total of 7 white-tailed deer sampled during the 2009 spring
collections in Hampshire County, according to the West Virginia
Division of Natural Resources (DNR).

These most recent deer testing positive for CWD were collected by
Wildlife Resources Section personnel working in cooperation with local
landowners, and they were all located within the Hampshire County CWD
Containment Area (i.e., that portion of Hampshire County located North
of U.S. Route 50). The CWD agent previously has been detected outside
the containment area in the adjacent portion of Hampshire County, and
the area of known infected deer does continue to slowly expand.

These collections have been designed to investigate and determine the
prevalence and distribution of the disease in Hampshire County. In
addition, wildlife biologists are carefully monitoring changes in the
structure of the deer herd within the CWD containment area.

The 1st case of CWD in West Virginia was confirmed on 2 Sep 2005.
Since then, DNR has been fully engaged in activities guided by its CWD
Incident Response Plan, which is designed to accomplish the following
objectives:

- Determine the distribution and prevalence of CWD through enhanced
surveillance efforts.
- Communicate and coordinate with the public and other appropriate
agencies on issues relating to CWD and the steps being taken to
respond to this disease.
- Initiate appropriate management actions necessary to control the
spread of this disease and prevent further introduction of the disease.

To date, CWD surveillance efforts conducted by the DNR have resulted
in a total of 45 deer being confirmed positive for CWD in Hampshire
County. Ongoing and extensive surveillance efforts being conducted by
Wildlife Resources Section personnel throughout West Virginia have not
detected CWD outside of Hampshire County.

CWD is a neurological disease found in deer and elk, and it belongs to
a family of diseases known as transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies. The disease is thought to be caused by abnormal,
proteinaceous particles called prions that slowly attack the brain of
infected deer and elk, causing the animals to progressively become
emaciated, display abnormal behavior and invariably results in the
death of the infected animal. There is no known treatment for CWD, and
it is fatal for the infected deer or elk. It is important to note
that, currently, there is no evidence to suggest CWD poses a risk for
humans or domestic animals.

"Landowner and hunter cooperation throughout this entire CWD
surveillance effort in Hampshire County continues to be excellent,"
noted DNR Director Frank Jezioro. "As we strive to meet this wildlife
disease challenge and implement appropriate management strategies, the
support and involvement of landowners and hunters remains essential.
DNR is committed to keeping the public informed and involved in these
wildlife disease management actions. Our well trained and professional
wildlife biologists, wildlife managers and conservation officers are
working diligently to effectively address this wildlife disease
threat, and we are collaborating with nationally recognized wildlife
disease experts at the Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study
in Athens, Georgia," said Jezioro.
