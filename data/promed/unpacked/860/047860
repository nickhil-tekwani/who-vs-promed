Glasgow health officials are probing 2 probable cases of botulism poisoning in drug injecting heroin users. Both patients were said to be from the Greater Glasgow and Clyde area and both are in a serious condition in hospital.

Addicts are urged to seek medical attention if they experience blurred or double vision, difficulty swallowing and speaking, or inflammation. Botulism can progress to a paralysis of the arms, legs, and eventually the muscles that control breathing.

NHS [National Health Service] Greater Glasgow said the cause of infection in the current cases was being investigated and that they are focussing on intravenous drug use. Dr Catriona Milosevic, consultant in public heath medicine, said: "It is important for injecting drug users to engage with the wide range of services we offer designed to help them tackle their addictions.

"However, for those who continue to inject it is extremely important that they seek urgent medical help if they show these early symptoms."

Botulism is a rare but potentially fatal condition caused by toxins produced by _Clostridium botulinum_ bacteria. The organism can be found in soil, dust, and river or sea sediments. The bacteria themselves are not harmful, but they can produce poisonous toxins when they are deprived of oxygen. The toxins are some of the most powerful toxins known to science. They attack the nervous system and cause paralysis (muscle weakness) that gradually spreads down the body from the head to the legs.

Treatment usually involves neutralizing the toxins with injections of special antibodies. Most sufferers make a full recovery, but death can occur in between 5 percent and 10 percent of cases.

[Wound botulism occurs when spores of _Clostridium botulinum_ contaminate a wound, germinate, and produce botulinum neurotoxin in vivo. Most of the wound botulism cases have been among injecting drug users (IDUs). Those IDUs who intentionally or accidentally inject subcutaneously or intramuscularly may be particularly vulnerable to infection.

Black tar heroin continues to be associated with clusters of wound botulism, both in the USA and in Europe. This form of heroin is a gummy black substance usually produced in makeshift factories, mostly in Mexico, adjacent to opium poppy fields (1). It is generally injected subcutaneously in a process referred to as skin popping. The local area may be unremarkable or may be necrotic or abscess forming.

The tarry nature of the drug has led to a number of diluents ("cutting" agents), which have been postulated to be the source of the _C. botulinum_ spores. In Passaro's study (1), the development of wound botulism was not affected by cleaning the skin, cleaning the injection paraphernalia, or sharing needles.

Clinicians should suspect botulism in any patient with a descending, flaccid paralysis. Botulinum antitoxin is effective in reducing the severity of symptoms for all forms of botulism if administered early in the course of the disease and should not be delayed for the results of microbiological testing.

In cases of wound botulism, antimicrobial therapy and surgical debridement are necessary to remove the organism and avoid relapse after antitoxin treatment. _C. botulinum_ is sensitive to benzyl penicillin and metronidazole.

Toxin type A (one of now 8 types of botulinum toxin) causes most cases of wound botulism in the USA. The syndrome produced by toxin type A is most severe, with more rapid progression of paralysis and a higher proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation. All toxin types exert their action on the cholinergic system at the presynaptic motor-neuron terminal by blocking acetylcholine transmission across the neuromuscular junction.
