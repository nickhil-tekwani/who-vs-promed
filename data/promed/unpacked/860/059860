----------------------------------------------------------------------
Date palm (_Phoenix dactylifera_) is one of the most important plants grown for its edible fruit. Diseases are among the major factors affecting its growth and productivity.

In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the causal agent of black scorch on date palm was found to be _Thielaviopsis punctulata_. The pathogen was isolated from all tissues of diseased trees. Depending on the severity of the infection, symptoms included tissue necrosis, wilting, neck bending, death of terminal buds, and eventual plant mortality.

This fungus produced 2 types of conidia: the thick-walled aleuroconidia (chlamydospores) and phialoconidia (endoconidia). In addition, all target regions of 5.8S ribosomal RNA, 28S ribosomal DNA, beta-tubulin, and transcription elongation factor 1-alpha genes of the pathogen were amplified using polymerase chain reaction. We found that [a difenoconazole] fungicide inhibited the mycelial growth of _T. punctulata_ both in vitro and in vivo.

The morphology of the fruiting structures, pathogenicity tests, and molecular identification confirmed that the causal agent [of black scorch in UAE] is _T. punctulata_. This is the 1st report of the disease and the fungus on date palm in the UAE.

[Black scorch of date palm is caused by _Ceratocystis radicicola_ (previously _Thielaviopsis punctulata_) and _C. paradoxa_ (previously _T. paradoxa_), either alone or as coinfection. The disease has been reported in all date growing areas worldwide and on many date varieties. The pathogens cause a range of symptoms on the host, which has led to other disease names such as bud rot, bending head, crazy disease (Medjnoon), inflorescence blight, trunk rot, stem bending, dry basal rot, and heart rot. Symptoms mostly include dark lesions on leaves, necrosis of affected tissues, and black discolouration ("scorch") of fronds and fruit stands. If, in severe cases, the terminal bud is affected, the palm most likely dies. Occasionally, palms have been reported to have recovered, showing a characteristic bend in the region of infection which reduces fruit production for years. External stress factors are thought to increase host sensitivity to infection.

Not much appears to be known about the epidemiology of the black scorch fungi. Other species in the genus can be soil borne and are also spread by water, mechanical means (for example on cutting tools), and with plant material. Beetles have been reported as important vectors in some hosts. Disease management for black scorch may include orchard sanitation (burning of infected plant matter or whole palms), disinfection of cutting tools and wounds resulting from harvesting or frond pruning, as well as sprays of copper-based fungicides.

_C. radicicola_ can also affect other hosts and can cause, for example, fruit rot of citrus. It is not clear from the report above if this is the 1st report of the fungus in the country or only of the disease on date palm. Date black scorch disease was reported for the 1st time in neighbouring Qatar in 2014 (ProMED-mail post 20141015.2868387), where it results in an estimated annual yield loss of 30 per cent.

Other _Ceratocystis_ species cause diseases in a range of crops (see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives), including kiwifruit (wilt), mango (sudden decline), coconut and other palms (stem bleeding), sugarcane (pineapple disease), clove (decline), and lettuce (black rot).
