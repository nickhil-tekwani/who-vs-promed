A New Jersey food company is recalling 17 600 pounds of mousse, a pate-type
poultry product, because it may be contaminated with a bacteria that can
cause an uncommon but potentially fatal disease.
D'Artagnan Inc. of Newark, N.J., recalled the mousse after tests revealed
they may contain _Listeria monocytogenes_, which can cause listeriosis, the
Agriculture Department said Thursday. The testing followed several reports
of illnesses.
Healthy people rarely contract listeriosis, but the disease can cause high
fever, severe headaches, neck stiffness and nausea. It can be potentially
fatal to people with weak immune systems -- infants, the elderly,
chemotherapy patients and persons with HIV infections or other chronic
diseases. Listeriosis can also cause miscarriages and stillbirths.
The recalled products are 8-ounce packages of "D'Artagnan Pork Free Mousse
Truffee" and "D'Artagnan Pork Free Peppercorn Mousse." The products were
distributed nationwide, exported to Canada, and possibly through Internet
and catalog sales.
The recall applies to all products with date codes through "Feb 28 00."
Each package has the number "P9678" inside the USDA seal of inspection.
The government said consumers who purchased the mousse should return it to
the store where it was purchased. Anyone concerned about illness should
contact a doctor immediately.
For more information consumers can call USDA's meat and poultry hot line at
1-800-535-4555. The hot line is staffed from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. EST Monday
through Friday.
