[Because of the comments made by Wick Engel in the reference cited above I
am posting Dr. Carol Meteyer's response. This thread concerning NDV in
cormorants at the Salton Sea, separate from the VVND outbreak in Fresno, is
now cut. - Mod.MHJ

Re: Fresno VVND in cormorants: implications [Note that this posting was
subsequently re-titled as indicated above. - Mod.ES
I have read the [above referenced post twice and am having difficulty
understanding the points being made. I can say that both Federal (National
Wildlife Health Center) and State (California Veterinary Diagnostic Lab
System) labs have received double crested cormorants nestlings from the
April die-off at the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge and have
subsequently received clinically affected juvenile cormorants from Salton
Sea. Virus isolation efforts have been on-going since April. As mentioned
before, although clinical signs, field circumstances, serological results
and microscopic lesions support neurotropic Newcastle disease virus as the
potential cause of the cormorant mortality and morbidity, this has not yet
been confirmed through virus isolation. This is not because people have not
or are not trying to isolate the virus. There are no extrodinary gross
lesions at necropsy of these cormorants. The lesions are microscopic,
involving the brain and spinal cord (references forwarded in response to
previous questions from ProMED-mail. I can provide them again if needed).
