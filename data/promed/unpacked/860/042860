Re: Equine Cases in Florida: CORRECTION
---------------------------------------
Dr Harrell has pointed out an error in the Moderator's comments
accompanying the post: West Nile virus, horses - USA (Florida &
Virginia) 20011025.2636.
The 7 previously confirmed equine cases listed refer to the state of
Georgia. In fact there had been 129 previously confirmed equine cases
in Florida according to the most recent USDA update available at the
time of posting.
Dr Harrell indicates that as of today (Thu 25 Oct 2001), utilizing the
USDA WNV equine case definition, the number of confirmed cases in
Florida has risen to 190 equine cases of WNV in 30 counties.
