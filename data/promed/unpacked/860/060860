To mark World Rabies Day, the Ministry of Health [organized] an open day on vaccination and health education on [Sun 27 Sep 2015] at the Belvedere Park and Avenue Habib Bourguiba in Tunis, under the slogan "By vaccinating your dog, you protect yourself and your pet."

"Together against rabies," is this year's theme of the World Day held on 28 September each year.

According to the Ministry of Health, Tunisia continues to record cases of rabies in humans, especially during the past 2 years. 5 deaths from rabies have been reported in 2015 in Tunisia and there were 3 in 2014. The Ministry of Health provides medical and preventive assistance and the necessary care to people exposed to dog bites free-of-charge in all public health institutions. In 2014, 47 000 people were vaccinated against rabies following a dog bite, compared with 41 000 in 2013, its statement said.

The Ministry of Health emphasizes the need for joint efforts to fight against rabies, given that responsible preventive behavior is the most important way of preventing the disease. The same source recommended that people who are bitten should wash the wound thoroughly with water and soap and go as soon as possible to the nearest health center.

It is also recommended that dogs should be vaccinated annually to protect them against rabies and that household waste should be managed properly to discourage the proliferation of stray dogs.

As an initiative to strengthen prevention measures against rabies, the Ministry of Health has established a website and a Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/events/721933297886049/) dedicated to the promotion of the national program against rabies, in order to enable all citizens and especially health workers to obtain instant and up-to-date information they may need.

Rabies is an infectious disease caused by a virus. In over 99 per cent of human cases, rabies virus is transmitted by domestic dogs through the saliva inoculated via a bite or a scratch. The incubation period for rabies is 1 to 3 months, but may vary from less than a week to more than a year. The disease usually begins with a fever and often pain or an unusual or unexplained paresthesia (tingling, itching, burning) in the site of injury.

The World Health Organization recommends in its reports to treat the wound as quickly as possible. It also recommends the administration of a series of doses of a powerful and effective rabies vaccine. It is worth noting that effective treatment shortly after exposure can prevent the onset of symptoms and death.

According to WHO, each year rabies kills tens of thousands of people worldwide, mainly in Asia and Africa. Each year, over 15 million people worldwide are vaccinated following a bite to prevent the onset of rabies, and this avoids hundreds of thousands of deaths per year, according to WHO.

[This is a commendable initiative taken by the Ministry of Health of Tunisia on the occasion of World Rabies Day to sensitize citizens to the danger of this disease and educate them on urgent measures to be taken, should they be bitten by an animal suspected of being rabid. The involvement of veterinary services in this event is not mentioned in the article; however, one can assume they have been involved, given that the annual incidence of human rabies cases seems to be increasing in Tunisia and that only a vigorous and sustained action regarding stray dogs is capable of reducing these human cases. - Mod.AB

Tunisia was one of the 1st countries in which trials in vaccinating stray dogs have been performed (ref 1). At that time, no effective bait for dogs, compatible with the baits developed and widely, effectively applied for wildlife, became commercially available.

A recent pilot study in Morocco showed, according to the authors, that oral vaccination of both owned and stray dogs is feasible with baits specifically developed (and described) for dogs and adapted modes of distribution (ref 2). Results of large-scale trials are anticipated.
