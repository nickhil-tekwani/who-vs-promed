African swine fever in Tanzania
---------------------------------
See also: 23 Apr 2004, 20 Feb 2004, 17 Oct 2003.
Immediate notification report
Information received on 19 Jan 2005 from Dr. Barnos W.S. Kimaryo, Director
of Veterinary Services, Ministry of Water and Livestock Development, Dar es
Salaam.
Report date: 18 Jan 2005
Reason for immediate notification:
A sudden and unexpected increase in the distribution, incidence, morbidity
or mortality of a listed disease prevalent within a country or zone/compartment
Date of start of the event:
27 pigs died in Pamba ward, Nyamagana district, Mwanza region, between
15-28 Dec 2004. African swine fever (ASF) was suspected by a veterinary
technician who referred the case to a veterinarian of the Mwanza Veterinary
Investigation Centre (VIC), who, on the basis of the presenting
symptomatology and pathology, tentatively diagnosed ASF on 28 Dec 2004.
Nature of diagnosis:
Clinical, post-mortem and laboratory
Details of outbreak:
1st administrative division: Mwanza region
Lower administrative division: Nyamagana district
Type of epidemiological unit: village
Name of the location: Pamba
Species: sui
Number of animals in the outbreak:
susceptible: 5000
cases: 483
deaths: 337
destroyed: ...
slaughtered: 140
Map:
[The outbreak location is roughly equidistant from Rwanda, Uganda and
Kenya. See:

- Mod.PC]
Diagnosis:
Laboratories where diagnosis was made: Veterinary Investigation Centre
(VIC), Mwanza
Diagnostic tests used: clinical and post-mortem examination
Laboratories where diagnosis was made: Central Veterinary Laboratory/Animal
Disease Research Institute (CVL /ADRI), Temeke
Diagnostic tests used: serological tests (competitive ELISA(1))
Laboratories where diagnosis was made: Exotic Diseases Division, Onderstepoort
Diagnostic tests used: Veterinary Institute (OVI), South Africa - virus
isolation
Epidemiology:
Swill feeding from hotels was noted as common to all affected piggeries.
Tourist hotels in the Lake City of Mwanza source pork products from Arusha
district and a neighboring country.
The source of the outbreak could possibly be the districts of Arusha (which
had an ASF outbreak in 2003(2)), Kasulu or Kigoma (which were involved in
ASF outbreaks in April 2004(3)) or a neighboring country. Results of virus
sequencing will provide additional information.
Unlike the outbreaks that occurred in Kasulu, Kigoma and Rungwe in 2004,
mortality in the Mwanza outbreak was high, reaching nearly 100 percent in
some piggeries. This suggests either that the virus involved in the latest
outbreak is of a different, more virulent strain, or, that it is of the
same strain but that the affected pig population was naive and thus highly
susceptible. The is the 1st outbreak of the disease in the Mwanza region
for 10 years, substantiating the argument that the population was naive,
thus explaining the high morbidity and mortality rates observed.
Control measures:
- After suspicion of ASF, pig producers with affected pens depopulated
their pens and disinfected their premises.
- Mwanza region is under quarantine, and more intensive surveillance is
going on to establish the extent of the outbreak and monitor the control of
the disease.
- A public awareness campaign, through radio broadcasts, posters and
leaflets, has been initiated to raise awareness and increase compliance
with the control measures.
- A copy of this report has been sent to neighboring countries (Burundi,
Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda), AU-IBAR(4), SADC(5) and FAO(6).
