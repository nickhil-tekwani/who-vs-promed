Badminton acts to ensure event can go ahead after herpes outbreak
-------------------------------------------
The Beaufort Hunt stables -- which will be used for the 4-star horses at the Mitsubishi Motors Badminton Horse Trials in 6 weeks' time -- have been emptied to allow through cleaning and disinfection after confirmation of the equine herpes virus (EHV-1) in the stables on Mon [18 Mar 2013].

A statement from event director Hugh Thomas said: "Urgent action has been taken to ensure the hygiene and biosecurity of the stables. The equine herpes virus cannot survive outside the horse for any appreciable length of time."

These steps follow a meeting at Badminton on 20 Mar 2013 with Dr Richard Newton, the head of epidemiology and disease surveillance at The Animal Health Trust "to develop a strategy to contain the outbreak and to provide an effective biosecurity programme in order to ensure the safe running of the Badminton Horse Trials," according to the full report by the event's expert veterinary team.

The event has isolation premises "far enough away from Badminton House and Park so that, even in the event of further cases developing, they will not be in a position to threaten the event stables and grounds."

The 6 horses which had close contact with the horse confirmed to have the neurological form of EHV-1 will be monitored separately and all 33 in-contact horses will be closely monitored. The horse in question is improving and expected to make a full recovery.

There will be no horses in the stables, nor riding in the park between now and the arrival of competitors.

"We are assured that this approach will provide a clean and safe environment for competitors and their horses at the Badminton Horse Trials," continued the report.

The report concluded: "It is an accepted risk of horse competition that horses coming from many different home stables and environments can carry infection with them and present a risk to each other, although this risk is considered to be acceptably small (but never zero in the case of EHV-1) in 'elite' athletic horses such as those attending the Badminton Horse Trials.

"However it is to be hoped that all horses taking part will be monitored as part of their normal programme at home and, as always in the past, all horses will be routinely examined by veterinary surgeons on arrival at Badminton before being allowed into the stables."

[The following additional information has been selectively derived from the mentioned report of an expert veterinary team that has advised the Horse Trials in respect to the described EHV event:

"On Friday 15 Mar 2013 a horse showing clinical signs consistent with the neurological form of EHV-1 infection was examined by a veterinary surgeon in the Beaufort Hunt stables at Badminton House Gloucestershire. EHV-1 infection was subsequently confirmed the following day on samples analysed at The Animal Health Trust, Newmarket. The stables and all horses present were isolated immediately and hunting was cancelled the following day in order to prevent further spread of the virus.

A total of 33 horses were identified as being potential contacts by virtue of being on the affected premises with the horse showing clinical signs, although only 6 of these were in close contact within the same airspace. One of these 6 animals has subsequently been identified as a potential source of the EHV-1 infection as it was brought to the stables from another yard in close proximity to a recent outbreak of EHV-1 infection.

Testing of all in-contact horses on the affected Badminton premises was undertaken immediately by nasal swabs and blood samples on confirmation of the diagnosis. Tests results received on Mon 18 Mar and Tue 19 Mar 2013 confirmed evidence of EHV-1 infection but only among the 6 close contacts within the same shared airspace as the clinical case and none of these animals has shown clinical signs of disease. There is currently no evidence clinically, serologically (blood) or virologically (swab) of infection among any of the horses outside the immediate contacts within the shared airspace, although further tests are required to confirm freedom from infection in these groups. The horse showing clinical signs is improving and is expected to make a full recovery".

The full experts report is available at http://www.badminton-horse.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Disease-Badminton-EHV.pdf.

Outbreaks with specific strains of EHV-1 infection result in neurologic disease. Clinical signs vary from mild in coordination and posterior paresis to severe posterior paralysis with recumbency, loss of bladder and tail function, and loss of sensation to the skin in the perineal and inguinal areas. In exceptional cases, the paralysis may progress to quadriplegia and death. Prognosis depends on severity of signs and the period of recumbency.

EHV is not zoonotic; it is not included among the 11 equine diseases in OIE's list of internationally notifiable diseases.
