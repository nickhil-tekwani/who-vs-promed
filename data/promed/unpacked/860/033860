Meeting on the Ebola Virus Disease Epidemic at the Presidency of the Republic

-This Sat 27 Apr 2019, the Head of State, Felix Tshisekedi, chaired a meeting on the Response to the Ebola Virus Disease Epidemic underway in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri. Several members of the government, including Prime Minister Bruno Tshibala, the Deputy Prime Minister in charge of the Interior and Security, the Minister of State for the Budget, the Minister of Defense, the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Health, were invited to this important meeting.

-The Minister of Health, Dr Oly Ilunga Kalenga, had the opportunity to present to the President of the Republic, as he had wished, the evolution of the epidemic as well as the challenges and the positive progress of the response. In his presentation, the Minister of Health insisted that, given the difficult security situation, this epidemic had gone beyond public health. So far, the epidemic has been contained in 2 provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo, but in order to put an end to it, it is necessary to strengthen the multisectoral component of the response, and therefore the involvement of other ministries under the coordination of the Prime Minister, Head of Government.

"The @MinSanteRDC #Ebola report does not mention this, but sources tell me 2 of today's cases are healthcare workers. Neither was vaccinated; 1 refused to go for care when she got sick. I believe they would bring the HCW case total to 92, with at least 33 deaths." - Mod.LK]

[2] Summary

-Fri 26 Apr 2019 CIDRAP update: DRC's 23 Ebola cases today top daily record
[CIDRAP(Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/04/drcs-23-ebola-cases-today-top-daily-record

[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]

The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) today [26 Apr 2019] said Ebola infections have been confirmed in 23 more people, a record number for one day, coming on the heels of worsening conditions in hard hit areas of North Kivu and Ituri provinces.

The surge of cases, which often happens after attacks on the Ebola response, puts the new outbreak total within striking distance of 1400 cases, and today [26 Apr 2019] the fatality count reached 900.

The 23 new cases are from 8 different locations, 9 of them in Katwa, one of the main epicenters and the scene of one of the recent violent episodes that stalled important response activities -- including case finding and contact tracing -- that are key steps in battling the outbreak.

The other new cases are from Mandima (3), Musienene (2), Butembo (2), and one each in Kalunguta, Vuhovi, Komanda, and Mabalako.

Health officials are also investigating 260 suspected cases. The new cases announced by the DRC health ministry today [26 Apr 2019] boost the outbreak total to 1396 cases, which includes 1330 confirmed and 66 probable infections.

Ten more people died from their infections, putting the fatality count at 900. Eight of them died in their communities, a factor known to increase the risk of virus transmission, given that viral loads are highest during severe illness and at death and that those caring for loved ones in homes don't have personal protective equipment to protect against Ebola. Two of the deaths occurred at Katwa's Ebola treatment center.

The World Health Organization has halted some of its activities in areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) affected by the Ebola virus until it can ensure the safety of medical staff and others responding to the outbreak.

It said that it was working with the DRC government to review and strengthen security measures, including establishing security perimeters around staff residences and ensuring that staff comply with curfews.

The moves follow the killing on 19 Apr 2019 of Richard Valery Mouzoko Kiboung, a WHO epidemiologist from Cameroon who was working on the Ebola outbreak.

WHO says that the overall risk of Ebola remains high in DRC, but the global risks remain low.

Uganda: Who Briefs Diplomats On Ebola Preparedness and Response Activities in Uganda
----------------------------
The World Health Organization (WHO) Representative Dr Yonas Tegegn Wodermariam and staff recently briefed ambassadors and heads of bilateral and multilateral organizations in Uganda on the current Ebola situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the preparedness activities implemented in the country since August 2018.

In the briefing held at the WHO Country Office, Dr Yonas informed the diplomats that the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo continues to escalate. As of 23 Apr 2019, a total of 1353 cases (1287 confirmed and 66 probable) including 880 deaths had been recorded.

He added that the current outbreak situation in the DRC makes it increasingly likely for Uganda to import EVD cases. This has put the Ministry of Health supported by partners on heightened alert by implementing various preparedness activities since August 2018. It is this preparedness that constituted the briefing by WHO to the partners.

Active case search and surveillance is one of the main activities being implemented aimed at ensuring that no case is missed in the health facilities or in the community. Accordingly, 26 districts considered to be at high-risk of EVD have been covered now and have capacity in contact tracing and surveillance.

Since August 2018, heightened surveillance has resulted in screening of over 6 million people for EVD at border Points of Entry (PoEs) located in several districts and at Entebbe International Airport. Vigilance and active contribution of the trained surveillance teams have led to identification and investigation of 560 alerts EVD as of today [26 Apr 2019].

In EVD outbreaks, infection prevention control (IPC) in health facilities and communities is the main barrier for prevention of amplification of transmission of the infection, and it is a key determinant on how fast the disease spreads, is controlled and eventually stopped. It has been a major area of focus for MoH, WHO and partners with the IPC committees revived in 562 health units in 22 districts. A total of 9806 health workers in 22 districts have also been mentored on recommended IPC practices and standard operating procedures and can ably adhere to required IPC measures.

Chlorine mixing into appropriate concentrations, which is an effective disinfectant in EVD outbreaks, has been strengthened with the training of 301 health workers in 61 health facilities. In addition, all health facilities including PoEs in the Rwenzori sub-region have been stocked with IPC supplies.

Laboratory capacity has also been enhanced, and now health workers in 24 districts are able to safely collect, package and transport EVD samples to the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) for investigation. USAID has supplemented this component with provision of 10 complete 500 module VHF kits, which are pre-positioned in Kampala in readiness for a response. WHO has provided an additional 10 abridged kits that are currently used to support alert management and drills.

Regarding EVD vaccination, 4420 frontline health workers have been vaccinated against the disease in 13 districts. The government has recently issued a new permit to WHO to import an additional 3000 doses of EVD vaccine to cover more frontline health workers considered to be at high risk. The country also now has 13 trained national vaccination teams ready to offer the service anywhere in the country including during actual EVD response.

Capacity for psychosocial support has been strengthened with the training and deployment of 404 health workers in 13 districts. Furthermore, 180 and 526 health workers in 17 districts have been trained on safe and dignified burials (SDB) and case management respectively.

In the high-risk districts, 10 isolation units have been built and equipped ready to receive patients. Indeed, most of the reported alerts cases mentioned above including the 10 cases of confirmed cases of Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever have been managed in these units. Two more isolation units are under construction in Kihihi and Kisoro Hospitals. SDB burial teams have been trained in 17 districts, and 8 ambulances have been procured and are on standby in the districts.

For community-based responders, WHO and partners have trained 6417 Village Health Teams (VHTs) members; 4751 community leaders; 1463 sub-county councillors, 330 religious leaders; 256 traditional healers; and 2693 local council I chairmen in 17 districts on community-based disease surveillance and community engagement.

Similarly, UNICEF has supported the orientation of 611 teachers in 243 schools in Kisoro district on EVD prevention, detection and control. These and other influential people have managed to visit 333 021 households sharing EVD messages.

In addition, WHO, UNICEF and Uganda Red Cross Society have produced 18 000 job aids on EVD used by VHTs and other community mobilisers. These have been complemented by 21 635 radio spots and 354 radio talk shows have been produced and aired on 21 radio stations. These partners have also supported the production of 724 193 posters and 883 627 leaflets on EVD messages in local languages and in English. Over 3 million people have been reached directly with EVD prevention messages through home visits, community meetings or one-on-one counselling sessions.

However, despite all these efforts, there is still a lot to do. As Dr Yonas pointed out, "the cost of response in case Uganda gets EVD cases is far higher than that of preparedness. A lot has been done, but we need to support the government to even do more within the existing health system" he said. He, therefore, urged the diplomats to support the new Ebola Preparedness and Contingency Plan that is under development.

The USA ambassador to Uganda, Her Excellency Deborah Ruth Malac acknowledged that the outbreak in the DRC is not yet in the right direction but cautioned against "over preparedness," which should not negatively affect the management of other diseases in the country. She appreciated WHO and partners for the good work and called for more support and vigilance to contain the outbreak right in DRC.

[What is so frustrating about this current Ebola outbreak is that all the tools (knowledge from experience, vaccine, antivirals) are available that should be able to control spread of the virus, but "should" is the operative word here. Even with all these tools at hand, if they can't reach the people where they are needed, they cannot be effective. The solution to the problem of trust and danger to the health care workers is elusive. As long as community centers are chosen over Ebola treatment centers, and community deaths continue with unsafe burials, without universal vaccination, it will be extremely difficult to control the outbreak, as evidenced by the continuing increase in case numbers.

It is not clear what Her Excellency Deborah Ruth Malac means by "over preparedness," but if Ebola is not brought under control, other diseases such as malaria, measles, and TB will be exacerbated by inaccessibility of the infected individuals and consequent inability to address them. I am not sure that one can ever be over prepared for a disease that continues after more than 8 months with cases and deaths rising in number. - Mod.LK
