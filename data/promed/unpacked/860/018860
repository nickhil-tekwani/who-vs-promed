The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is warning dog owners of a possible link between certain dog food brands and a serious form of canine heart disease. The FDA has investigated more than 500 cases of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in dogs eating certain types of food, according to their statement. DCM is a condition that [affects] a dog's heart and results in an enlarged muscle. Dogs with DCM tire easily, cough, and have difficulty breathing.

When the FDA 1st alerted the public in 2018 to cases of DCM, the agency didn't mention specific brands, only foods labeled as "grain-free" and containing peas, lentils, other legume seeds and/or potatoes as the main ingredients.

As part of that investigation, the FDA has now identified 16 brands of dog food that had the most frequent reported cases of DCM. The top 3 brands, according to the FDA, are Acana, named in 67 reports; Zignature, named in 64, and Taste of the Wild, named in 53 reports.

[The complete list of dog] food brands named most frequently in DCM cases reported to the FDA (with number of case reports listed in parentheses) are Acana (67), Zignature (64), Taste of the Wild (53), 4Health (32), Earthborn Holistic (32), Blue Buffalo (31), Nature's Domain (29), Fromm (24), Merrick (16), California Natural (15), Natural Balance (15), Orijen (12), Nature's Variety (11), NutriSource (10), Nutro (10), and Rachael Ray Nutrish (10).

"We know it can be devastating to suddenly learn your previously healthy pet has a potentially life-threatening disease like DCM. That's why the FDA is committed to continuing our collaborative scientific investigation into the possible link between DCM and certain pet foods," said Dr. Steven M. Solomon, director of the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine. Solomon says the FDA has not determined the nature of the potential link, but it encouraged dog owners to work closely with their veterinarians.

Agency findings are inconclusive: The agency has not asked the companies to recall their products. "We have shared case report information with these firms so they can make informed decisions about the marketing and formulation of their products," the FDA wrote.

"In parallel with the FDA investigation, our own 3rd party internal studies found no link between our high quality pet food products and any of the other physical characteristics correlating to DCM," says Zignature in a statement posted on their website. Zignature added, "As we continue to have great confidence in our naturally sourced diets meeting the needs of dogs who suffer from allergies and grain intolerances, we are providing an exclusive line designed by our expert formulation team that is nutritionally sound and grain-inclusive."

Champion Petfoods, the parent company for Arcana, said it takes the issue and is working "internally and with other industry leaders on research into the cause of DCM in order to help Pet Lovers understand the facts," Champion said in a written statement.

"...Of the 77 million dogs in the US, 0.5% to 1% have DCM, and of those dogs with DCM, fewer than 0.1% are speculated to have DCM related to diet, although it is not scientifically proven. In the recipes Champion makes, we emphasize fresh and raw meat with total animal-derived ingredients ranging from 60% to 85% of the finished product. Legumes are not a significant feature in Champion's recipes, and never have been."

CNN has reached out to Taste of the Wild, but has not received a response. The company addressed the investigation in 2018, saying "scientists have been unable to pinpoint the exact cause of DCM."

If DCM is caught early, heart function may improve in cases not linked to genetics with appropriate veterinary treatment and dietary modification, according to the FDA.

If a dog is showing possible signs of DCM or other heart conditions, the FDA encourages you to contact your veterinarian as soon as possible. In extreme cases such as sudden weakness or collapse, you may need to seek emergency veterinary care.

The FDA says it will continue to investigate the connection and will update the public as information becomes available.

[Canine dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a primary disease of cardiac muscle resulting in a decreased ability of the heart to generate pressure to pump blood through the vascular system. The definitive cause of canine DCM is a subject of debate, although a number of factors, including nutritional, infectious, and genetic predisposition, have been implicated. The fact canine DCM occurs at a higher incidence in specific breeds suggests a heritable genetic component to this disease, although it is likely its etiology is multifactorial. Breeds predisposed to DCM include the Doberman Pinscher, the Great Dane, the Boxer, and the Cocker Spaniel. Dietary carnitine deficiency may play a role in some cases of Boxer DCM, and taurine-responsive DCM has been identified in Cocker Spaniels.

We are not told the breeds reported to the FDA in cases related to the food. However, one wonders if taurine and carnitine may be deficient in these diets?

DCM is characterized by dilation of the ventricles with ventricular wall thinning. In many cases, dilation of all 4 chambers of the heart is seen. The ability of the heart to serve as a pump is diminished, and clinical signs of DCM occur secondary to either decreased delivery of oxygenated blood to the body (lethargy, weakness, weight loss, collapse) or congestion of blood in the lungs (coughing, increased respiratory rate and/or effort, abdominal distention) or both. Cardiac dilation, decreased oxygen supply, and increased oxygen demand secondary to elevated heart rate and ventricular wall stress may predispose to the development of cardiac arrhythmias arising in either the atria (atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia) or in the ventricles (ventricular premature complexes, ventricular tachycardia). Arrhythmias may predispose affected dogs to sudden death.

DCM is diagnosed by echocardiography, which demonstrates the chamber dilation and indices of decreased pump function characteristic of the disease. Thoracic radiography is useful to evaluate pulmonary (lung) tissue and vessels, and may show evidence of fluid accumulation in the lungs (pulmonary edema) or around the lungs (pleural effusion). Electrocardiography may be used to characterize heart rhythm and to rule out arrhythmias, and in some cases, a 24-hour electrocardiogram (Holter monitor) may be recommended to more accurately characterize cardiac rhythm.

Treatment of DCM is directed at improving systolic (pump) function of the heart, dilating the peripheral blood vessels to decrease ventricular workload, eliminating pulmonary congestion if present, and controlling heart rate and cardiac arrhythmias if present. These treatment goals are addressed by the administration of cardiac medications, which may be delivered by injection in emergent situations or orally in patients that are more stable.

Canine DCM can be a devastating disease, and the prognosis for dogs with DCM is variable depending upon breed and status at presentation. The prognosis for Doberman Pinschers with DCM, for example, is less favorable than in other breeds, while DCM in Cocker Spaniels may be relatively slowly progressive. Patients presenting in congestive heart failure generally have a worse prognosis than those not in congestive heart failure at presentation. Irrespective of this, medical therapy may provide significant improvement in lifespan and quality of life in affected dogs.

Although there are different schools of thought, the media and advertising seems to drive much of consumer purchasing decisions. However, consultation with a veterinary nutritionist may be more informative for making a healthy choice for your pet.

While marketing seems to indicate dogs are carnivores, as they are classified, they may be more truly omnivores. Notice how many times your dog consumes grass? This does not mean your dog is ill. Also study of wild canines killing another animal indicates the intestines, followed by the liver are most frequently consumed first. Most often the animal being consumed in the wild is a herbivorous animal (one consuming plant), perhaps suggesting necessary nutrients from plants are needed in the canine.
