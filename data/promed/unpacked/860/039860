Background
----------
Influenza A(H7N9) virus was identified in China in March 2013; since then, the virus has caused 2 epidemic waves in the country. There were 134 laboratory-confirmed cases detected in the 1st epidemic wave from January to September 2013. In the 2nd epidemic wave of human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in China from October 2013 to October 2014, we estimated that the risk of death among hospitalised cases of infection with influenza A(H7N9) virus was 48 percent (95 percent credibility interval: 42-54 percent), slightly higher than the corresponding risk in the 1st wave. Age-specific risks of death among hospitalised cases were also significantly higher in the 2nd wave. Using data on symptomatic cases identified through national sentinel influenza-like illness surveillance, we estimated that the risk of death among symptomatic cases of infection with influenza A(H7N9) virus was 0.10 percent (95 percent credibility interval: 0.029-3.6 percent), which was similar to previous estimates for the 1st epidemic wave of human infections with influenza A(H7N9) virus in 2013. An increase in the risk of death among hospitalised cases in the 2nd wave could be real because of changes in the virus, because of seasonal changes in host susceptibility to severe infection, or because of variation in treatment practices between hospitals, while the increase could be artefactual because of changes in ascertainment of cases in different areas at different times.

Introduction
------------
Since the 1st human case of infection with novel avian influenza A(H7N9) virus was identified in China in March 2013, there have been 2 major epidemic waves of human infections to date. The 1st epidemic wave, in the spring of 2013, waned during the late spring and summer, while a 2nd major epidemic wave occurred during the winter of 2013/14 and had waned by the end of the spring of 2014, while sporadic cases have continued to be reported (as of 9 Oct 2014). A small number of clusters of laboratory-confirmed cases have been identified in both epidemic waves, but the virus has not appeared to have the capacity for sustained human-to-human transmission.

Confirmed cases of infection with influenza A(H7N9) virus have generally been identified in hospitalised patients with pneumonia, however, a small number of confirmed cases was identified through routine sentinel influenza-like illness surveillance which indicates the possibility for a larger number of mild influenza A(H7N9) virus infections [5,6]. This has implications for determination of the clinical severity of influenza A(H7N9) virus infections, because the confirmed cases may not fully reflect the clinical spectrum of infections, and consequently changes in case ascertainment could lead to artefactual variation in risk of severe outcomes.

In previous work, we demonstrated that the case fatality risk among confirmed cases of infection with the 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus was very heterogeneous and difficult to interpret, and we characterised the severity of influenza A(H7N9) virus infections via the risk of fatalities among hospitalised cases (the 'hospitalisation fatality risk', HFR) and the risk of fatalities among symptomatic cases (the 'symptomatic case fatality risk', CFR). In the 1st epidemic wave of influenza A(H7N9) virus infections in spring 2013, we estimated the HFR at 36 percent, and the CFR at 0.16 percent to 2.8 percent [3]. The objective of the present study is to estimate the HFR and symptomatic CFR in the 2nd epidemic wave, and to determine whether the severity of human infections with influenza A(H7N9) virus has changed over time.

Results [abbreviated; to provide an illustration the methodology]
-----------------------------------------------------------------
In the 1st wave of influenza A(H7N9) cases in 2013, 134 confirmed cases were identified, of whom 124 required hospitalisation for medical reasons. Among the hospitalised cases, the risk of serious outcomes was higher among older hospitalised cases. Furthermore, we identified higher risks of fatalities among cases hospitalised before 31 Mar 2013, the date when the 1st confirmed human cases of influenza A(H7N9) virus infection were officially announced in China. We therefore divided the 1st wave into 2 parts: wave 1A for 18 cases hospitalised before 1 Apr 2013, and wave 1B for 106 cases hospitalised from 1 Apr to 30 Sep 2013. In the 1st epidemic wave, the median age was 60 years in wave 1A and 61 years in wave 1B. Among the cases under 60 years who required hospitalisation for medical reasons, the HFR in wave 1A was 51 percent (95 percent CI: 21-79 percent), significantly higher (p = 0.039) than the HFR of 17 percent (95 percent CI: 7.6-30 percent) in wave 1B. For cases above 60 years who required hospitalisation for medical reasons, the HFR was also significantly higher (p = 0.025) in wave 1A (77 percent; 95 percent CI: 48-94 percent) vs wave 1B (42 percent, 95 percent CI: 31-54 percent). We did not identify significant differences between wave 1A and 1B in the risk of death or ventilation, or in the risk of death/ventilation/ICU admission.

There were no statistically significant differences between age-specific risks of death or ventilation, or death/ventilation/ICU admission in wave 2 compared to either wave 1A or wave 1B, while estimates of the risks of serious outcomes were generally lower across age groups in wave 1B compared with wave. While the 2nd epidemic wave occurred over a broader geographic area than the 1st wave, Zhejiang province was heavily affected in both epidemic waves. We therefore examined the risk of death among the subset of hospitalised cases in this province. Zhejiang province reported 40 cases in wave 1B and 88 cases in wave 2, and the risk of death among hospitalised cases under  60 years old was significantly higher in wave 2 compared with wave 1B (risk ratio 7.1; 95 percent CI: 1.3-292; p = 0.017) and not significantly different in hospitalised cases above 60 years old (risk ratio 1.5; 95 percent CI: 0.93-2.8; p = 0.099).

We examined the delays from onset to admission and identified similar patterns over calendar time, while the delay from onset to laboratory confirmation has shortened over time and in wave 2 the mean was 8 days. Distributions of time from admission to death and from admission to discharge were similar over time.

Discussion/Conclusions
----------------------
The resurgence of human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in a 2nd epidemic wave in 2013/14 demonstrates the continued public health risk of this novel strain. Control of the virus in animals is complicated, because the infections in poultry are asymptomatic. Human-to-human transmissibility of the virus remains limited, as evidenced by the very small number of potential secondary infections identified through detailed contact tracing of confirmed cases.

We identified differences in the severity of illness of hospitalised cases in the earlier part of the 1st epidemic wave in 2013, with greater risk of mechanical ventilation, ICU admission and death among cases hospitalised before 31 Mar 2013 when the 1st confirmed human cases of influenza A(H7N9) were officially announced. One explanation for this is more timely antiviral treatment and more appropriate supportive care for cases hospitalised after 31 Mar 2013. Another possible explanation is detection bias in the early phase of the spring 2013 epidemic wave, where more severe cases were prioritised for repeated laboratory testing, and cases with prolonged virus shedding or higher virus shedding had a greater chance of confirmation.

In the 2nd epidemic wave in 2013/14, we identified a significantly greater HFR compared with the latter part of the 1st epidemic wave in 2013 (Figure 2) and in persons under  60 years of age in Zhejiang province where cases occurred in both epidemic waves, but no difference in the symptomatic CFR. It is possible that this significant difference in HFRs is due to ascertainment bias in cases in different locations at different times, even within the same province. Alternatively, the HFR could have increased, because hospitalised cases in the 2nd epidemic wave in 2013/14 were less likely to be transferred to larger referral hospitals, because of changes in the virus, or because of seasonal changes in the prevalence of other pathogens that could cause secondary or co-infections and modify the severity of influenza A(H7N9) virus infections. Whereas ascertainment of infections in hospitalised cases may have changed over time due to changes in awareness and testing capacity, the ascertainment of influenza A(H7N9) cases through the established sentinel ILI [influenza-like illness] network should have remained more stable over time.

[The authors conclude that it is important to assess the severity of human infections with influenza A(H7N9) virus, as part of ongoing risk assessment of this virus. While the overall picture is that the severity of human infections has not substantially changed, they found some evidence that the HFR was higher in the 2nd epidemic wave in 2013/14. The results again highlight that many influenza A(H7N9) virus infections can cause mild disease and that the risk of death among laboratory-confirmed cases is a misleading measure of severity.

It remains difficult to estimate the future potential of influenza A(H7N9) virus to become an evolving human pathogen. - Mod.CP
