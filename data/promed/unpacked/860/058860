[As is unfortunate with many OIE formal reports, the cause of this and other Romanian outbreaks remains obscure. There is probably a background of unreported, unexpected livestock deaths that goes unreported and uninvestigated. The ecology of Romanian soil is prime for anthrax spore survival. As a result, the disease maintains its sporadic nature. But it is early February, still winter, not spring, cold, so a grazing source is unlikely. So it could be from a contaminated commercial dairy feed, in which case we would expect to see outbreaks on other farms in the area that bought this feed. Or from contaminated hay or silage probably purchased, as there was no prior report to OIE of an outbreak in this area. Getting out and investigating possible causes of outbreaks builds a body of useful field knowledge and experience that pays off in having a more efficient control and surveillance activity. Warm butts achieve little. - Mod.MHJ
