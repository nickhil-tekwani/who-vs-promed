The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease dated 26 Sep 2018:
- A total of 154 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, of which 123 were confirmed and 31 were probable.
- Of the 123 confirmed, 70 died and 43 are cured.
- 11 suspected cases are under investigation.
- 3 new confirmed cases in Beni.
- Of these new confirmed cases, 2 are known contacts from the same family who did not want to be vaccinated but who voluntarily went to the Ebola Treatment Center as soon as the 1st symptoms appeared.
- No new deaths.
- 2 new people healed in Beni.

News of the response
---------------------
Days of the dead city in Beni and Butembo
- This Thu 27 Sep 2018, the governor of the province of North Kivu, Julien Paluku, participated in the daily meeting of the coordination of the response to Beni and visited the CTE. He encouraged the teams and reminded them that they had all the support of the provincial government.

- In Butembo, the dead city day was lifted, and all commercial activities in the city resumed, allowing the response to resume field activities.

Collaboration of the community in Ndindi
-------------------
- All riposte activities were held normally in Beni this Thursday [27 Sep 2018]. In the Ndindi district, the cradle of resistance, the teams of the riposte were greeted without a hitch by the population. The local committee of community leaders had called for a catch-up session for non-immunized contacts and household decontamination of the latest confirmed cases from the neighborhood. Unlike the previous weeks, there was a lot of enthusiasm among neighborhood residents who voluntarily registered for vaccination.

Vaccination
-----------
- Launch of the vaccination of several contacts and contacts of confirmed cases of Tchomia that were located in Bunia. These contacts readily agreed to collaborate with the health authorities.
- Since the beginning of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 12 029 people have been vaccinated, including 4122 in Mabalako, 3662 in Beni, 1632 in Mandima, 884 in Butembo, 903 in Katwa, 270 in Masereka, 164 in Komanda, 156 in Tchomia, 121 in Oicha, 65 in Kinshasa (medical staff to be deployed), and 50 in Bunia.

[From this report, it appears control efforts are moving forward again. Even though even a few days without tracing contacts make a difference, the suspension of activities fortunately was brief. Nonetheless, a very high risk remains, and a highly coordinated effort is needed among all international organizations and the MoH in order to beat this outbreak in the midst of armed conflict. - Mod.LK]

[2] WHO: Disease Outbreak News
- Thu 27 Sep 2018. Ebola virus disease - Democratic Republic of the Congo
[WHO Emergencies preparedness, response, Disease Outbreak News (DONs); edited]
https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/ebola-virus-disease-democratic-republic-congo-disease-outbreak-17

The response to the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is at a critical juncture. While substantial progress has been made, the situation is precarious given recent increases in insecurity, incidents of community reluctance, and geographical spread.

There have been a number of incidents in recent days, notably in Beni, which have led to loss of life among the local communities. WHO response activities have been severely limited as Beni and other towns mark a period of mourning for those who were killed. Security in Beni and other areas remains challenging.

The Ministry of Health (MoH), WHO, and partners continue to work closely with people in the affected areas to overcome reluctance and mistrust, which has developed among some communities. Rumours, misinformation, and traditional practices have led some families to opt to care for sick relatives at home; some patients have also left health facilities to seek alternative care. Together this results in health workers being unable to provide optimal treatment, and also increases the risk of infection for relatives and local community members. These factors have contributed to the geographical spread of the outbreak.

The movement of several cases across health zones in recent weeks is concerning; one infected individual who recently moved to Kalunguta Health Zone is the first to move into a "red" zone, a highly insecure and challenging environment where implementing response activities is extremely difficult, if not impossible. Responders are employing a range of new techniques in these red zones, including using armed escorts and training local health workers to trace contacts.

Where they have access, response teams continue to enhance activities to prevent new clusters and the potential spread to new areas. WHO continues to work in the affected areas, side-by-side with national and international partners, to support the response led by the MoH. There continues to be challenges with identifying all contacts, registered contacts being lost to follow up, delayed recognition of EVD in health centres, poor infection prevention and control (IPC) in health centres, and reluctance among some cases to be treated in Ebola treatment centres (ETCs). The priority remains strengthening all components of the public-health response in all affected areas, as well as continuing to enhance operational readiness and preparedness in the non-affected provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in neighbouring countries.

Since the last Disease Outbreak News (data as of 18 Sep 2018), 9 new confirmed EVD cases were reported: 5 from Beni, 1 from Butembo, and 1 from Mabalako health zones in North Kivu province, as well as 2 from Tchomia Health Zone in Ituri province. These are the 1st confirmed EVD cases to be reported from Tchomia Health Zone, which is near the Ugandan border; both cases, a couple, were linked to the ongoing Beni transmission chain. Two of the remaining 7 cases have been linked to ongoing transmission chains within the respective communities, while the last 5 cases are under investigation.

As of Tue 25 Sep 2018, a total of 151 EVD cases (120 confirmed and 31 probable), including 101 deaths (70 confirmed and 31 probable)[1], have been reported in 7 health zones in North Kivu province (Beni, Butembo, Kalunguta, Mabalako, Masereka, Musienene, and Oicha) and 2 health zones in Ituri province (Mandima and Tchomia) (Figure 1). An overall decreasing trend in weekly case incidence continues (Figure 2); however, these trends must be interpreted with caution given the expected delays in case reporting, the ongoing detection of sporadic cases, and the security situation that is limiting contact tracing. Of the 149 confirmed and probable cases for whom age and sex information is known, 23 percent, 20 percent, and 22 percent are aged 15-24, 25-34 and 35-44 years, respectively; females (56 percent) accounted for the greatest proportion of cases (Figure 3). Cumulatively, 19 (18 confirmed and one probable) health workers have been affected to date, 3 of whom have died.

The MoH, WHO, and partners continue to closely monitor and investigate all alerts in affected areas, in other provinces in the DRC and in neighbouring countries. As of Tue 25 Sep 2018, 17 suspected cases in the DRC are awaiting laboratory testing. Since the last report was published, alerts were investigated in several provinces of the DRC, as well as in neighbouring countries; and to date, EVD has been ruled out in all alerts from neighbouring provinces and countries.

Public-health response
-----------------
The MoH continues to strengthen response measures, with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include coordinating the response, surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory capacity, IPC measures, clinical management of patients, vaccination, risk communication and community engagement, psychosocial support, safe and dignified burials (SDB), cross-border surveillance, and preparedness activities in neighbouring provinces and countries.

- As of 18 Sep 2018, 201 experts have been deployed by WHO to support response activities, including emergency coordinators, epidemiologists, laboratory experts, logisticians, clinical-care specialists, communicators, and community-engagement specialists.

- Over 5700 contacts have been registered, of which 1660 remain under surveillance as of 25 Sep 2018 [2]. From 19-25 Sep 2018, a high proportion of contacts ranging between 95-98 percent were followed up daily; however, coverage fell to between 60-76 percent from 23-25 Sep 2018 due to the suspension of field activities in Beni and a new front of operations in Tchomia.

- As of 25 Sep 2018, 63 vaccination rings have been defined in addition to 26 rings of health workers and other frontline workers. These rings include the contacts (and their contacts) of all confirmed cases from the last 4 weeks. To date, 12 029 people consented and were vaccinated, including 5041 health or frontline workers and 2497 children. The ring-vaccination teams are currently active in 3 health areas in North Kivu and 2 in Ituri.

- ETCs are operational in Beni and Mangina with support from the Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA) and Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), respectively. MSF Switzerland and the MoH are supporting an ETC in Butembo. International Medical Corps (IMC) is supporting the recently opened Makeke ETC in Ituri province. MSF and the MoH are setting up a 12-bed isolation facility in Kasenyi.

- WASH and IPC activities are ongoing in the DRC and are supported by several partners in the field. Numerous activities have occurred in health facilities in the affected areas including facility assessments, decontamination of centres, establishment of triage areas, and training on standard precautions as well as Ebola-specific IPC measures.

- The MoH, WHO, UNICEF, Red Cross, and partners are intensifying activities to engage with local communities in the affected areas. Community feedback is being systematically collected, and concerns are being addressed. Local frontline community-outreach workers are collaborating with Ebola response teams to strengthen community engagement and psychosocial support in contact tracing, patient care, SDBs, and vaccination of close contacts. The focus continues to be on intensifying activities aimed at addressing community concerns through direct partnership with community members.

- Red Cross SDB teams are trained and operational in Mabalako, Beni, and Butembo health zones. Due to the new confirmed EVD cases in Ituri, the Red Cross is strengthening response capacity in Bunia, where one SDB team was initially trained. In preparation, training of Red Cross SDB teams in Goma started on Mon 24 Sep 2018. Civil protection SDB teams from Beni, Butembo, and Oicha have been trained as part of the "red zone strategy." As of Mon 24 Sep 2018, Red Cross SDB teams have successfully responded to 144 of the 176 SDB alerts received; 37percent of alerts were for community deaths, 36 percent were from ETCs, and 27 percent were from non-ETC health facilities. In addition, 4 alerts were sent to the civil protection SDB teams.

- Expert teams have deployed to 6 at-risk provinces (Bas Uele, Haut Uele, Ituri, Maniema, South Kivu, and Tanganika) to facilitate implementation of priority readiness actions, including strengthening multisectoral coordination, surveillance for early detection, laboratory diagnostic capacity, points-of-entry (PoE) surveillance, rapid-response teams, risk communication, social mobilization and community engagement, psychosocial support, case management and IPC capacities, operations support, and logistics.

- As of Tue 25 Sep 2018, health screening has been established at 45 PoEs and close to 6M travellers have been screened; over 17 000 means of travel have been decontaminated at these PoEs.

- To support the MoH, WHO is working intensively with a wide range of multisectoral and multidisciplinary regional and global partners and stakeholders for EVD response, research, and urgent preparedness, including in neighbouring countries. Among the partners are a number of UN agencies and international organizations including International Organization for Migration (IOM), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), World Food Programme (WFP), United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operation (ECHO), UK Public Health Rapid Support Team, multiple Clusters, and peacekeeping operations; World Bank and regional development banks; African Union, Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and regional agencies; Health Cluster partners and NGOs including ALIMA, ADECO, AFNAC, CARITAS, CEPROSSAN, CARE, COOPI, CORDAID, ICRC, IFRC, INTERSOS, MEDAIR, MSF, OXFAM, PNHF, Samaritan's Purse, and SCI; Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), Steering Committee, technical networks and operational partners, and the Emergency Medical Team (EMT) Initiative. GOARN partners continue to support the response through deployment for response and readiness activities in non-affected provinces and in neighbouring countries and to different levels of WHO.

WHO risk assessment
----------
This outbreak of EVD is affecting northeastern provinces of the DRC, which border Uganda, Rwanda, and South Sudan. Potential risk factors for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels include the transportation links between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries; the internal displacement of populations; and the displacement of Congolese refugees to neighbouring countries. The country is concurrently experiencing other epidemics (e.g., cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis) and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu and Ituri continues to hinder the implementation of response activities. Based on this context, the public-health risk was assessed to be high at the national and regional levels and low globally.

As the risk of national and regional spread remains high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure health authorities are alerted and are operationally ready to respond.

WHO advice
----------
WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to the DRC based on the currently available information. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no countries have implemented any travel restriction to and from the DRC. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

- EVD fact sheet (http://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ebola-virus-disease).
-------------------------
1. The number of cases is subject to change due to ongoing reclassification, retrospective investigation, and the availability of laboratory results.
2. The total number of contacts under surveillance is highly dynamic with new cases being registered daily, and those who complete 21 days of post-exposure follow-up, without developing symptoms, are released from surveillance.

[3] Protection of responders and civilians
- Wed 26 Sep 2018. WHO calls for protection of humanitarian workers and civilians in DRC
WHO [edited]
http://www.who.int/news-room/detail/26-09-2018-who-calls-for-protection-of-humanitarian-workers-and-civilians-in-democratic-republic-of-the-congo

The response to the outbreak of Ebola in North Kivu and Ituri provinces in the DRC is at a critical juncture, threatened by worsening insecurity, mistrust from affected communities, and extension into previously unaffected areas.

As of Tue 25 Sep 2018, the disease had affected 151 people and killed 101.

In recent weeks, a strong government-led response, supported by the World Health Organization (WHO), other UN partners, NGOs, and civil society, had resulted in a steady week-by-week reduction in cases.

But there is a risk now that hard-won gains may be lost.

1st, there has been an increase in frequency and severity of attacks by armed opposition groups. Attacks by armed opposition groups on the town Beni, in North Kivu, where the Ministry of Health and partners have based their response, have occurred with alarming frequency. Most recently a deadly attack on Sat 22 Sep 2018 left 21 dead, including 17 civilians.

As a result, WHO and its UN partners were asked to halt operations in Beni while the city mourns its dead. As of today [Wed 26 Sep 2018], some operations have begun to resume, but even a gap of 2 days has resulted in health workers not being able to reach contacts of Ebola patients to monitor their health or investigate alerts of potential cases.

Meanwhile, some families have chosen to care for sick relatives at home, often because they have been misinformed, and because a natural fear of the disease is now being exploited by local politicians.

Others sick with Ebola travel widely to seek alternative care, putting themselves, their families, and health workers at risk. This has brought infection to new locations, where teams cannot provide them with access to treatment or provide protective vaccines to their contacts. These include security red zones, which are difficult to access, and to areas bordering Uganda.

WHO calls on all relevant parties, and the governments or groups that have influence over these parties to help protect responders and civilians.

WHO also calls on governments in surrounding countries to accelerate the preparedness activities that they have begun, with WHO support, to ensure a level of readiness should they face cases of Ebola themselves.
