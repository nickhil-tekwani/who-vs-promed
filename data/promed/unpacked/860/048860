Foot-and-mouth disease [FMD], an infectious and sometimes fatal viral disease that affects cloven-hoofed animals, is spreading to more regions of the country.

The Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs said on Tuesday [6 Jan 2015] that FMD was confirmed at a cattle farm in Anseong, Gyeonggi Province, the 1st infection reported in cows for 4 years.

"One of the farm's 47 cows has been confirmed as having contracted the disease," the ministry said. "Vaccinations might have failed to immunize some of the cows against the disease."

However, cattle farms are not expected to be seriously affected by the current outbreak, as vaccination generally confers immunity on around 95 percent of the recipient herd, and there doesn't seem to have been any further spread, the ministry added.

In the most recent outbreak, the 1st case of FMD among pigs was confirmed at a farm in Jincheon, North Chungcheong Province, in early December [2014]. Since then the disease has spread to the Seoul metropolitan area and North Gyeongsang Province.

As of Tuesday [6 Jan 2015], more than 28 000 swine had been culled at 34 farms across the country.

[Anseong, in the province Gyeonggi, is situated about 80 km (50 miles) south of Seoul. The current outbreak has become the 4th in South Korea since 3 Dec 2014; all 3 previous outbreaks affected domestic swine. For OIE reports and map, see http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=16695.

According to the said reports, the current outbreak is caused by FMD virus serotype O.

According to South Korea's page on the website of the World Reference Laboratory for FMD (Pirbright), all FMD virus samples received from South Korea in 2011 and 2014 were similar, namely of serotype O, topotype SEA, lineage Mya-98. Following the major epizootic of 2011, the national veterinary authorities have introduced a policy of mass preventive vaccinations in all susceptible species, with a matching vaccine.

Our request for an update of the current FMD situation in North Korea, where FMD was recorded earlier last year (2014), is pending. - Mod.AS
