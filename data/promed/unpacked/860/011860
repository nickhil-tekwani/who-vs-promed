Vaccine warning


Figures from the Department of Health and Human Services reveal that of the 24 cases of meningococcal disease diagnosed so far this year [2017] in regional Victoria, 2 were diagnosed in Greater Bendigo and one in the Swan Hill council area.

The Victorian Government is urging teenagers 15 to 19 to get the free meningococcal vaccine, available until [31 Dec 2017].

One in 5 people in this age bracket carry the bacteria, which can be passed on by close contact such as kissing, coughing or sneezing. In 10 percent of cases meningococcal disease proves to be fatal.

[The Sunraysia is an ill-defined district, located in northwestern Victoria and southwestern New South Wales in Australia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunraysia). It can be can be found on the map at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunraysia#/media/File:Outline_map_of_the_Mallee_and_Sunraysia_regions.png. Greater Bendigo and Swan Hill are cities within the Loddon Mallee region that occupies more than a quarter of Victoria, known for its restaurants and wineries (http://www.rdv.vic.gov.au/victorian-regions/loddon-mallee).

Following the mass introduction into the population in 2003 of serogroup C conjugated meningococcal vaccine, the incidence of disease due to serogroup C fell dramatically. Since 2003, there has been a significant and sustained reduction in serogroup C meningococcal cases from 34 percent of cases in 2003 to 5.7 percent in 2012, accompanied by an increase in serogroup B from 60 percent in 2003 to 83 percent in 2012 (http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/cda-cdi3703-pdf-cnt.htm/$FILE/cdi3703e.pdf).

ProMED-mail reported in 2016 that serogroup W, rather than B has become predominant in Western Australia (ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - Australia (03): (WA) sg. W 20160925.4513543).

Because of the replacement of serogroup C by serogroups W and B, meningococcal serogroup B and quadrivalent conjugate (ACWY) vaccines are now funded for certain age groups in some Australian states "in response to locally predominant meningococcal B or W disease" (http://www.ncirs.edu.au/assets/provider_resources/fact-sheets/meningococcal-vaccines-fact-sheet.pdf).

The quadrivalent (A, C, W, Y) meningococcal conjugate vaccines are available through private prescription and also through state-funded adolescent programs in 5 states (New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, Queensland, and Western Australia) starting in 2017, for those aged 15-19 years or school years 10-12 (http://www.ncirs.edu.au/assets/provider_resources/fact-sheets/meningococcal-vaccines-fact-sheet.pdf). The B vaccine is available through private prescription and in South Australia from April 2017, in a statewide 2-year clinical study for students enrolled in years 10, 11, and 12 in 2017 at participating schools (http://www.ncirs.edu.au/assets/provider_resources/fact-sheets/meningococcal-vaccines-fact-sheet.pdf). - Mod.ML
