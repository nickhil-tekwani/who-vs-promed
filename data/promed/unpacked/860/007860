Australian scientists have discovered a genetic marker that can accurately predict which patients will experience more severe disease in a new strain of avian influenza (H7N9) currently found in China. Being able to predict which patients will be more susceptible to the emerging influenza strain will allow clinicians to better manage an early intervention strategy, researchers said. "By using genetic markers to blood and lung samples, we have discovered that there are certain indicators that signal increased susceptibility to this influenza," Professor Katherine Kedzierska, senior author of the study from the University of Melbourne, said.

"Higher than normal levels of cytokines, driven by a genetic variant of a protein called IFITM3, tells us that severe disease is likely," Kedzierska said. "We call this a 'cytokine storm,' and people with the defective genetic variant of the protein IFITM3 are more likely to succumb to severe influenza infection," she said.

Researchers are exploring how genetic sequencing and early identification can allow intervention in treating patients before they become too unwell, Professor Peter Doherty, lead author of the study, said. Researchers from the University of Melbourne are collaborating closely with Professor Jianqing Xu and his group from the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center in China.

The study was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).

Title: Early hypercytokinemia is associated with interferon-induced transmembrane protein-3 dysfunction and predictive of fatal H7N9 infection.

By Zhongfang Wanga and others

Abstract
----------
A unique avian-origin A/H7N9 influenza virus has so far caused 134 cases with 44 deaths. Probing the host factors contributing to disease severity, we found that lower levels of plasma inflammatory cytokines on hospital admission correlated with faster recovery in 18 patients with A/H7N9 influenza virus, whereas high concentrations of (in particular) IL-6, IL-8, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1[beta] were predictive of a less favorable or fatal outcome. Analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage samples showed up to 1000-fold greater cytokine/chemokine levels relative to plasma. Furthermore, patients with the rs12252-C/C IFN-induced transmembrane protein-3 (IFITM3) genotype had more rapid disease progression and were less likely to survive. Compared with patients with the rs12252-T/T or rs12252-T/C genotype of IFITM3, patients with the C/C genotype had a shorter time from disease onset to the time point when they sought medical aid (hospital admission or antiviral therapy) and a shorter interval to development of the acute respiratory distress syndrome stage (reflected by shorter intervals between clinical onset and methylprednisolone treatments and higher rates of mechanical ventilator use), as well as experiencing elevated/prolonged lung virus titers and cytokine production and higher mortality. The present analysis provides reported data on the H7N9 influenza-induced "cytokine storm" at the site of infection in humans and identifies the rs12252-C genotype that compromises IFITM3 function as a primary genetic correlate of severe H7N9 pneumonia. Together with rs12252 sequencing, early monitoring of plasma cytokines is thus of prognostic value for the treatment and management of severe influenza pneumonia.

Significance
-----------
A unique avian-origin H7N9 influenza virus caused 134 human infections with 44 deaths. The host factors contributing to moderate vs. severe disease are not clear. Here, we show that H7N9 severity was associated with a higher level of cytokines/chemokines. We demonstrate that the cytokines in the infected lung were 100- to 1000-fold higher than those in the plasma. Furthermore, we found that the IFN-induced transmembrane protein-3 (IFITM3) C/C genotype was associated with severe clinical outcome, as reflected by reduced time in seeking medical aid; more rapid progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome; and higher viral load, cytokine/chemokine levels, and mortality rate. Overall, our data suggest that the IFITM3 genotype is a primary driver of the observed differences in clinical outcome after H7N9 infection.

[3] Increased cytokine and chemokine levels

The severity of H7N9 [avian] influenza infection is linked to high cytokine levels, and some patients appear to have a genetic marker that correlates with more serious outcomes, according to a research team from China and Australia. [The group reported their findings in the 23 Dec 2013 edition of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) -- see above].

They examined cytokine and chemokine levels in plasma samples of 18 patients who were hospitalized in Shanghai with H7N9 infections. They also looked at bronchoalveolar lavage samples from 3 of the patients and conducted genetic sequencing tests on blood and lung samples. When they compared the clinical courses with the test results, they found that H7N9 severity was associated with higher levels of cytokines and chemokines, a pattern seen with other types of influenza infections, such as H5N1. They showed that cytokine levels were 100- to 1000-fold higher in plasma than in lungs, and the authors said that plasma levels may provide a "window" for assessing cytokine damage in infected lungs. The researchers also identified a genotype that related to more severe clinical outcomes: IFN-induced transmembrane protein-3 (IFITM3).

Peter Doherty, PhD, laureate professor at the University of Melbourne and lead author of the study, said in a 23 Dec 2013 press release that predicting how flu affects individuals could provide keys to managing the disease and allocating health resources. "We are exploring how genetic sequencing and early identification can allow us to intervene in treating patients before they become too unwell. As new cases of influenza emerge in the Northern Hemisphere, we try to keep a season ahead and prepare to protect the most vulnerable in our community," he said.

In other developments, Hong Kong's government today said an 80-year-old man hospitalized in early December [2013] with an H7N9 infection has died, according to a Reuters report. His case is one of 2 H7N9 cases recently imported into Hong Kong from the mainland city of Shenzhen [Guangdong province] and is now Hong Kong's 1st fatal case. The man's death pushes the number of fatal H7N9 cases to 48. Overall, 146 cases have been reported, all with links to mainland China, where the disease is thought to be spreading to people from infected market poultry.

Professor Peter Doherty, AC, Laureate Professor and a lead author of the study from the University of Melbourne said predicting how influenza works in individuals has implications for the management of disease and the resources on our health system.

"We are exploring how genetic sequencing and early identification can allow us to intervene in treating patients before they become too unwell. As new cases of influenza emerge in the Northern Hemisphere, we try to keep a season ahead and prepare to protect the most vulnerable in our community," he said.

Though the H7N9 strain has not been found in Australia, researchers from the University of Melbourne are collaborating closely with Professor Jianqing Xu and his group from the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center in China. In addition to this, Dr Zhongfang Wang, an NHMRC Australian-China Exchange Fellow, is also working closely with Melbourne experts.

["'Higher than normal levels of cytokines, driven by a genetic variant of a protein called IFITM3, tells us that severe disease is likely,' Kedzierska said.

It likely that the existence of virulence determinants in many viruses, in addition to avian influenza viruses, may similarly operate through production of cytokine storms. Identification of these mechanisms will greatly facilitate the treatment of other serious diseases. - Mod.CP]
