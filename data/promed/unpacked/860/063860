NAMERI, Aug 14: At least 7 wild elephants, including 2 calves, were found
dead near Bhorali river inside the Nameri national park in Assam, while 13
other tamed tuskers of the State Forest Department are suffering from
various diseases and have been undergoing treatment at the veterinary
hospital at Chariduar in Sonitpur district for the last 3 days.
Mahendra Saikia of the national park said that at least 7 wild elephants,
including 2 infant tuskers (about 4 years of age), were found dead without
any injury mark near Mahmora camp inside the national park at the bank of
river Bhorali, a tributary of river Brahmaputra, in mysterious
circumstances during the last 72 hours. [In addition the bodies of 2 male
tuskers were found at Pakhoi under Khari forest beat office of the national
park. The Sonitpur district veterinary department suspects that the
unnatural deaths of the wild tuskers might be due to Anthrax, which spreads
in an epidemic form in the nearby forests of Arunchal Pradesh.

Wildlife experts are flabbergasted by a malaise that has claimed at least
18 wild elephants in the northeast Indian states of Assam and Arunachal
Pradesh. An additional 13 elephants--most of them domesticated--in the
200-square-km Nameri National Park in northern Assam are battling this
fatal disease believed to be caused by liver flukes.
This disease threatens the existence of some 3500 pachyderms along the
800-km elephant belt of northern Assam [which boasts the highest
concentration of Asian elephants. Most of the elephants killed by this
disease were calves and semi-adults aged between 3 and 7 years. The
carcasses of 8 elephants were found in Nameri, while 7 were located in 3
neighbouring reserve forests. In the adjoining state of Arunachal Pradesh,
3 others were recovered around the Pakhoi Wildlife Sanctuary.
The first elephant death in Nameri National Park was reported on July 3,
but forest officials passed it off as a "normal natural death of a calf."
They pressed the panic button last week after elephant carcasses began
popping up all over the place. According to divisional forest officer Mr HP
Phukan, [necropsy on a carcass located on Tuesday revealed that the
elephants died due to [liver flukes.
"This is very serious," said chief conservator of forests (wildlife) Mr
Sonadhar Doley. "Our main concern is to prevent the disease from spreading
and felling other elephants."
This, conservationists felt, is easier said than done until wildlife
habitats are kept at a safe distance from human populations and their
domesticated animals. The liver fluke is water-borne [sic; water-related
would be more accurate. - Mod.MHJ, usually found in the livers of sheep
and pigs. Elephants in Northeast India had seldom been attacked by this
worm, though there have been reports of anthrax deaths, and vast wetlands
and rivers flowing past several villages into the protected forests are
adding to the problems.
"Most forest reserves in Assam and elsewhere in India are perilously close
to human habitations. Elephants in India have suffered most due to habitat
shrinkage, and it is not surprising that undesirable contact between
domesticated and wild animals is taking a toll on the latter," said Zoology
professor and wildlife activist, Mr PC Bhattacharjee.
He recalled the havoc caused by the rinderpest virus at the Kaziranga
National Park and neighbouring forests to prove his point. Rinderpest --
cattle are carriers of this virus -- had almost wiped out the rhino and
wild buffalo population in eastern Assam more than a decade ago.
Over the past couple of years, elephants in Assam have also been [in the
news for trampling at least 45 people to death [and destroying crops and
property. Most of these deaths were in low-lying areas known to be elephant
corridors but encroached upon by immigrants.
The jumbos have also often disrupted services in at least 3 airports in the
region, including a prime Indian Air Force base sited close to wooded areas.

[The normal liver fluke species for Asian elephants is _Fasciola jacksoni_.
The species involved here is not clear, though there is a suggestion it is
_F. hepatica_. Wildlife/human interactions on the borders of national parks
are common worldwide and a constant threat to both. Elephants can reduce
crops to nothing overnight. Thanks to Michael for forwarding the
information. - Mod.MHJ
