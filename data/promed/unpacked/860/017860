PENICILLIN-RESISTANT STREPTOCOCCUS PNEUMONIAE IN ONTARIO, 1987-1995:
Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major cause of pneumonia, meningitis,
septicemia, acute otitis media, and other serious infections, severely
affecting infants, young children, and the elderly. In the past, S.
pneumoniae was uniformly susceptible to penicillin, which remained the
drug of choice for serious infections. However, since the mid-1960s,
resistance to penicillin, which was first reported in Australia, has
been occurring with greater frequency in various parts of the world.
The percentage of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) isolates
with resistance to other primary therapeutic agents such as
trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), erythromycin, tetracycline,
and chloramphenicol as well as agents which are used for multi-drug
resistant isolates, such as ceftriaxone and cefotaxime, is also
increasing in various parts of the world.
In Canada, an isolate with
reduced susceptibility to penicillin was first reported in 1974, and a
multi-resistant strain of S. pneumoniae was first reported in 1983. A
survey of the literature indicates that the prevalence of PRSP varies
across Canada, and a recent report from Quebec shows that levels of
resistance are increasing.
All isolates of S. pneumoniae submitted to the Central Public Health
Laboratory, Toronto, have been tested for antimicrobial susceptibility
since April 1987. This report describes the results of S. pneumoniae
susceptibility to penicillin and other antimicrobial agents from April
1987 to April 1995...
In the present study, the prevalence of isolates with reduced
susceptibility to penicillin was higher than that previously reported in
Canada. Moreover, between 1991 and 1995, there was an annual increase in
the percentage of such isolates. The increase of isolates with high
resistance was more significant than the increase of ones with
intermediate resistance. Between 1987 and 1990, there was a wide
variation in the percentage of isolates which showed a high resistance
to penicillin; the decrease from 10% in 1989 to 1.3% in 1990 is of note.
The reason for this change is unknown. The authors suspect that mostly
resistant isolates of S. pneumoniae were referred to the Central Public
Health Laboratory from 1988 to 1989 for confirmation while isolates were
submitted in later years regardless of their susceptibility pattern.
Also, between 1987 and 1990, the majority of isolates were from
hospitals across Ontario (58%, 65%, 66%, and 70%, respectively),
compared to a more even distribution among hospitals and community
isolates in later years...
The first multi-resistant S. pneumoniae reported in Canada was resistant
to penicillin and chloramphenicol. In this study, only a small
percentage of isolates showed resistance to chloramphenicol. Isolates
with reduced susceptibility to penicillin were associated mainly with
resistance to TMP/SMX followed by resistance to erythromycin and
tetracycline. It is noteworthy that 18 of 21 (85.7%) of
chloramphenicol-resistant isolates were associated with resistance to
the cephalosporins...
In summary, data show an increase in the numbers of S. pneumoniae
isolates, submitted to Central Public Health Laboratory, which are
highly resistant to penicillin. Many of these also showed
multi-resistance to other primary therapeutic agents and third
generation cephalosporins. These results emphasize the importance of
continued monitoring of the patterns of susceptibility among S.
pneumoniae.
CCDR Editorial Comment: The above study reports the frequencies of
intermediate- and high-level resistance to penicillin to be 43% and 7%,
respectively, among 1,144 pneumococcal isolates submitted to an urban
public-health laboratory over an 8-year period. It contributes to the
growing literature describing antimicrobial-resistant S. pneumoniae in
Canada.
All such studies should be considered carefully because they may
differ in important elements, including clinical source of specimen
(sterile vs. non-sterile site), age of subjects sampled, and type of
reporting laboratories (hospital vs. public-health). The increased rates
of resistance to penicillin reported in this study compared with others
likely reflects some of these differences. A recent Canada-wide,
hospital-based survey of pneumococcal infection in children reported
that 1.6% and 0.4% of invasive pneumococcal isolates showed
intermediate- and high-level resistance, respectively. Continued
laboratory and population-based national surveillance for
antimicrobial-resistant S. pneumoniae is essential in monitoring this
evolving problem.
