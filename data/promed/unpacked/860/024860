In Kirov Approximately 150 People Are Hospitalized With an Unknown Poisoning
In Kirov's hospitals there are about 150 people, who poisoned themselves by
unknown alcohol-containing liquid. [This suggests but does not state they
drank the alcohol containing liquid. � Mod.TG]
They all came into the infectious department of local hospital with the
identical symptoms: they had yellow skin, high temperature and strong
headache. Usually such complications cause hepatitis; however, doctors,
until now, cannot make a precise diagnosis.
As reports NTV, the traditional methods of treatment thus far do not help.
Seventeen of the patients have already died, and the condition of the rest
continues to deteriorate.
The colleagues of the police, who are involved in the investigation of the
incident, consider that one of the means of everyday chemistry could become
the reason for poisoning.
Now the colleagues of the police together with Rospotrebnadzorom withdraw
this means from the counters of stores and commercial depots.

[The translation of this article suggests that this is a household chemical
or disinfectant that has contaminated some alcohol. Although the article
does not state the individuals drank the alcohol, ingestion is still the
likely route of poisoning.
At this point, to recognize that 150 are hospitalized and 17 have died is
certainly significant. The symptoms listed are not specific to any toxin.
However, methanol can cause hepatitis and has been the adulterant in
alcohol in Russia in the past. � Mod.TG]
