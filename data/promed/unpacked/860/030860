Bird flu hits S China city
--------------------------
The H5N1 avian flu virus has been detected in the city of Zhanjiang in south China's Guangdong province, experts confirmed on Tuesday [18 Sep 2012]. The virus has infected 14 050 ducks and killed 6300 of them since 11 Sept 2012, when symptoms were 1st reported, a Ministry of Agriculture official said.

After the epidemic was confirmed, local authorities cordoned off an infected area in the city and killed all poultry in the area before starting to decontaminate it, the official said.

China is particularly prone to bird flu epidemics, as it has the world's largest poultry population and many rural farmers live in close proximity to their poultry.

[China submitted on 18 Sep 2012 an official "immediate notification" to the OIE, reporting the above outbreak; the report includes an interactive map and is available at http://tinyurl.com/97ode5t.

On 29 Aug 2012, China submitted a final report concerning its previous H5N1 epizootic, which had -- reportedly -- started on 2 Dec 2011 and caused a total of 6 scattered outbreaks. The said epizootic was declared as "resolved." A map showing the mentioned 6 outbreaks is available at http://tinyurl.com/98npgrp.

Viet Nam recently reported the circulation of a particularly pathogenic new H5N1 virus strain in its poultry; there were some indications of this strain originating in China (see 20120908.1286497, 20120909.1287382, 20120910.1288966). Genotyping of the virus involved in the current outbreak in Guangdong may shed some light on its relationship with the Vietnamese strain. The efficiency of available vaccine strains to provide satisfactory protection against this strain is of particular value. - Mod.AS
