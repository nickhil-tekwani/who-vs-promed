Dairy cattle quite commonly get antibiotics in their feed at low levels as
"growth promoters". This is common in most food animals, including poultry
feed. Inclusion of antibiotics results in less down time and faster growth
in meat animals.
E. coli O157:H7 is already antibiotic resistant, with antibiotics causing
increased toxin formation. Consequently antibiotics are contra-indicated in
treating an infection. My personal conjecture is their is a connection
between the continuous use of "growth promoter" antibiotics (which are
frequently mutagenic) and the rise of new, resistant strains of intestinal
flora (such as E. coli and Salmonella sp.).
How do you immunize against E. coli O157:H7 or S. typhimurium? When only
25-100 organisms can overload an immature or weakened immune system?

With carriage rates for EHEC of up to 50% reported all antibiotics would do
is create antibiotic resisitant EHEC. Do we want this?
It is not just E. coli O157, it is all the other toxigenic E.coli carried
that matter.
