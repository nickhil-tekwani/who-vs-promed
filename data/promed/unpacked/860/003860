A spate of foodborne illnesses in leafy greens and other produce in recent years has sickened consumers and disrupted growers and supply chains. It has been thought that hydroponic and aquaponic systems could reduce these issues because there is little opportunity for pathogens like _Escherichia coli_ to contaminate the edible parts of plants.

A Purdue University study, however, has found the presence of Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ (STEC) [also called enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ EHEC] -- the same bacteria that have made consumers of several produce products ill -- in hydroponic and aquaponic growing systems. Hye-Ji Kim, an assistant professor of horticulture and the study's corresponding author, said the findings suggest growers using these systems should be careful in handling and harvesting to avoid contamination.

"Many people think that there is no chance that _E. coli_ could be present in these systems and that risk of contamination is low," said Kim, whose results were published in the journal Horticulturae. "Our findings suggest there is some potential for food safety concerns. We're not saying that these foods are unsafe, but that it's important to handle these plants properly and carefully."

The _E. coli_ outbreaks that have occurred in recent years tend to happen in leafy greens and other vegetables grown in irrigated fields. Potential sources could be from _E. coli_ in manure or groundwater that reaches the edible portions of plants, or from those contaminants getting to plants after root damage by wild animals. Proponents of hydroponic and aquaponic systems suggest their growing methods would reduce or eliminate any risk of contamination. Both soilless systems, hydroponic plants are grown in water and chemical fertilizers or nutrient solutions, and aquaponic systems include the raising of fish, with fish wastewater utilized as water and nutrient source for the plants.

The fish used in aquaponic growing systems may introduce _E. coli_ to water and potentially produce crops, and accidental contamination is possible in hydroponic systems. Hye-Ji Kim and Yi-Ju Wang suggest growers take careful steps to ensure that these bacteria don't reach plants that could sicken consumers. Kim, Yi-Ju Wang, a graduate student in Kim's lab, and Amanda Deering, a Purdue clinical assistant professor of food science, set up both hydroponic and aquaponic systems for growing lettuce, tomatoes and basil for about 2 months. The scientists found _E. coli_ in both systems at the time of harvest.

In the aquaponic system, the authors believe the _E. coli_ was introduced by the fish. The bacteria were found in the water, on plant roots and in fish feces. "Our separate aquaculture system confirmed that fish feces were a major source of contamination with STEC in the aquaponic system," the authors wrote. "These results indicate that introducing contaminated fish can be a source of foodborne pathogens in aquaponics."

The presence of _E. coli_ in the hydroponic system, in which fish were not used, suggests that the bacteria were introduced accidentally. Kim believes it could have splashed from a nearby aquaponic system or have been introduced by a visitor who brought it in from outside the greenhouse. Either way, the presence in the system suggests that accidental contamination is a real risk.

_E. coli_ was also found on plant roots in both systems, but the bacteria did not internalize in the plants. In other words, even with the bacteria present in water and on the roots, the edible portions of the plants were still safe to consume. The key, Kim says, is proper handling to ensure that _E. coli_ or other pathogens don't make it to the edible parts of plants. Damaged roots would allow bacteria into the plants, potentially making it to edible portions internally. And splashing of water during growing or harvesting could introduce bacteria to the edible portions of the plants.

"The best way to manage these issues is to not touch roots or water throughout production cycles. If you do, you should thoroughly wash your hands before touching the edible parts of the plants," Kim said. "Proper sanitization of equipment is also important. And acquiring fish that do not contain _E. coli_ would also be beneficial." Kim's lab is continuing to investigate food safety risks in hydroponic and aquaponic systems. Projects include damaging roots and simulating splashes to understand how much contamination can occur.

[This moderator did not have access to the primary work to see what strains of _E. coli_ were found. Although fish, per se, are not considered significant natural reservoirs of pathogenic _E. coli_, this Brazilian study suggests a potential risk:

Ribeiro LF, Barbosa MM, de Rezende Pinto F, et al: Shiga toxigenic and enteropathogenic _Escherichia coli_ in water and fish from pay-to-fish ponds. Lett Appl Microbiol. 2016; 62(3): 216-20.

Abstract
--------
_Escherichia coli_ is part of the normal microflora of the intestines of mammals. However, among the enteric pathogens, it is one of the leading causes of intestinal diseases, especially Shiga toxigenic _E. coli_, which can cause diarrhoea, haemorrhagic colitis and complications like haemolytic uraemic syndrome and thrombotic thrombocytopaenic purpura. _E. coli_ is considered a serious public health problem. Water and fish samples were subjected to biochemical tests to confirm the presence of _E. coli_ and by PCR to verify the presence of pathogenic strains (O157, enteropathogenic and Shiga toxigenic) in water and fish (skin, gastrointestinal tract and muscles) from pay-to-fish ponds located in the Corrego Rico watershed in the northeastern region of the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Of the 115 _E. coli_ isolates from fish or water, 5 (4.34%) contained eae and stx2 genes, 1 had only the eae gene and 2 had the stx1 gene. An isolate containing the stx2 gene was also found in the water sample. In addition, 8 isolates (6.95%) from the fish gastrointestinal tract contained rfbEO157:H7 (O157 gene), and 3 (2.61%) contained stx2 and eae genes, demonstrating the potential risk to the environment and public health. The results provide useful basic information for the proper management of these environments and animals in order to prevent faecal pollution, reducing health risks to the Brazilian population.
