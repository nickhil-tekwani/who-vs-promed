We have isolated West Nile virus [WNV from two horses from the Riverhead
area of Long Island, New York on RK13 cells. We (and CDC) have identified
the isolates by PCR as being WNV. This cell line is routinely used to
isolate the equine encephalitis viruses (WEE, EEE, VEE). I agree the IgM
capture ELISA should pick up antibodies to WNV in affected horses; we are
in the process of establishing this test for our WNV diagnostics.

[Thanks to Beverly for this update. Two papers, albeit regarding an
alphavirus infection in horses an a flavivirus infection in humans, might
be helpful. It's only the capture antibody and antigen that needs to be
changed.

Serodiagnosis of western equine encephalitis virus infection in equines:
relationship of antibody titer and test employed to observed onset of
clinical signs. J. Am. Vet. Med. Assoc. 183:438-440, 1983.
2. Monath, T.P., R.R. Nystrom, R.E. Bailey, C.H. Calisher, and D.J. Muth.
Immunoglobulin M antibody capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for
diagnosis of St. Louis encephalitis. J. Clin. Microbiol. 20:784-790, 1984.
Although WNV and St. Louis encephalitis viruses are closely related, the
IgM antibody capture ELISA should be sufficiently specific to allow
definitive diagnoses of equid infections with WNV.
If the IgM capture ELISA is only now being developed, how have the
serodiagnoses of the Long Island horses been made to date? - Mod.CHC
