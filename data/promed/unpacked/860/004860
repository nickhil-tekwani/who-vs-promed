Two clinical laboratory samples of pigs from East Jaintia Hills district tested positive for African Swine Fever (ASF). The death of pigs was reported from Synrang Shahkhain village (Rymbai) and Wapungskur Village of East Jaintia Hills District, Deputy Commissioner F.M.Dopth informed.

In order to prevent the spread of this highly contagious disease to other villages, the Deputy Commissioner has also issued an order banning inter-state and inter-district movement of pigs.

[For the location of India's north-eastern state Meghalaya, see map at https://tinyurl.com/y4mmqw33. This is the 1st ASF outbreak reported from Meghalaya. Earlier, India reported to the OIE (20200522.7366844) its 1st identified ASF outbreaks, in 2 of its north eastern States, namely Arunachal Pradesh and Assam, bordering the ASF-affected China and Myanmar (respectively).

As can be seen in OIE's interactive map presenting the summary of India's initial report, one of the outbreaks in Assam was located adjacent to northern Meghalaya (https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=34283; click on the said outbreak to center and zoom in).

In May 2020, forest officials in Arunachal Pradesh reportedly retrieved the carcasses of 6 wild boars in East Siang district. Several other wild boars were reported to have also died in Upper Siang district previously (item 2 in 20200516.7343308); they suspected ASF. Though wild boars are known to be involved in ASF spread, there are strikingly few reports on ASSF in Asia's fauna; see item 2 further. - Mod.AS].

Abstract
--------
African swine fever is a growing threat to the livestock industry. We examined data indicating that in most countries in Asia, most notified events were related to farm outbreaks; meanwhile, only a few wild boar cases were reported. We hypothesize the virus circulates unnoticed in wild boar populations in Asia.

[Thanks are due to Mod.MHJ for forwarding this research letter. The following extract (references omitted) deserve attention.

"Recent reports from several countries in Europe, including the Baltic states and Belgium, suggest ASF virus might maintain itself within wild boar populations and occasionally spill over into domestic pig farms. This newly described epidemiologic cycle proposes direct transmission among wild boar and indirect intraspecific transmission through contaminated wild boar carcasses. This cycle also suggests the persistence of ASFV in wild boar populations even in the context of low wild boar density and despite high death rates caused by the disease.

"In August 2018, ASFV was detected in China, the leading pig producer worldwide. Since then, the virus has also been reported in Mongolia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Hong Kong, North Korea, South Korea, Laos, Myanmar, the Philippines, Timor-Leste, Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, and India. The large-scale spread of ASFV demonstrates the challenges of controlling the disease in this region, which has a high density of domestic pigs, a high proportion of low biosecurity farms, a widespread practice of feeding pigs with food waste, and a complex pork trade network involving wet markets and slaughterhouses with poor hygiene.

"Maps of predicted habitat suitability suggest that most areas of East and Southeast Asia are highly suitable for wild boar. Although information is limited about the spatial distribution of wild boar in Asia, studies suggest that in some regions of China, wild boar density could be similar to that of eastern Poland, where ASFV has circulated in wild boar for more than 5 years. Reports of crop losses caused by wild boar in China indicate that close interactions between wild boar and human activities occur in the region.

"The widespread presence of ASFV in pigs in Asia implies regular environmental spillover from the pig supply chain. Therefore, it is highly likely that ASFV is already widely circulating within some wild boar populations in Asia, causing substantial wild boar death. Because life expectancy of ASFV-infected animals is very short, the most effective way to conduct surveillance in boar populations is to monitor reports of infected boar carcasses. Numbers of reported ASFV wild boar cases and farm outbreaks vary by nation. Except for South Korea, which reported 605 infected wild boar carcasses and 17 outbreaks in domestic pig farms from the time of the emergence of the virus in Asia until 8 May 2020, countries in Asia reported a much lower ratio of wild boar cases to farm outbreaks than their counterparts in Europe. In these countries (excluding South Korea), there were only 23 reports of infected wild boar carcasses (in China and Laos only) despite 843 official ASF notifications of farm outbreaks after the virus emerged in Asia in August 2018.

"The near absence of notifications of ASFV-infected wild boar cases in Asia highlights shortcomings in surveillance for ASF in wildlife, jeopardizing the success of ASF control policies in the region. We believe this lack of surveillance partly results from government division of responsibilities; in most countries, responsibility for ASF surveillance in livestock belongs to a different government department than that for monitoring wildlife populations. We argue that long-term success of ASF control in Asia is possible only with risk-based ASF surveillance in wild boar populations by a multisectoral effort of wildlife and agricultural departments. Although surveillance of wild boar is a necessary component of an ASF control strategy, it must be complemented by effective ASF control measures in domestic pigs, such as improved regional coordination, increased resources for surveillance, incentives for farmers to report outbreaks, and enforcement of interventions. Without these measures, the region might become a major hub of ASFV infection".
