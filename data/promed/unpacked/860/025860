Listeria outbreak now at 20 cases: source remains unknown
---------------------------------------------------------
The number of cases of a foodborne illness that has killed 5 state
residents has risen to 20, New Jersey health authorities said.
Investigators remained unable to pinpoint the source of the sickness that
has also struck people in 7 other states. Besides New Jersey, cases have
been reported in Pennsylvania, New York, Delaware, Connecticut, Maryland,
Michigan, and Ohio. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
have isolated and matched the strain of bacteria in 31 patients from 5 of
the 7 other states, suggesting that these patients acquired the illness
from eating the same food.
Five of New Jersey's 20 cases have been conclusively linked to the strain
of listeria identified from the outbreak, said Eddy Bresnitz,
epidemiologist with the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior
Services. Some 20 to 30 cases are usually reported in New Jersey every
year. Throughout the United States, there are an estimated 2500 cases of
listeriosis a year, with about 500 reported deaths.
Bresnitz said patients have been filling out detailed questionnaires about
their eating habits going back at least 4 weeks before they fell ill. "This
is like detective work on a national level, finding out what the affected
people ate, when they ate it, what brand, and then looking for the
commonality and then testing the food and people," said Thomas Montville,
professor of food science at Rutgers' Cook College in New Brunswick.
In New Jersey, the illness has claimed the life of a person in Burlington
County, 1 in Gloucester, another in Mercer, and 2 people in Bergen County,
state health department officials said. Of the 20 cases detected so far in
New Jersey, the youngest person has been 56 and the oldest 82. The latest
person to take ill reported symptoms that started on 18 Sep 2002, Bresnitz
said. None of the victims has been identified. So far 5 other people also
have died, in New York City, Pennsylvania, and Michigan.
Those at higher risk of getting listeriosis include the elderly, pregnant
women, newborns, and adults with weakened immune systems, such as those
with terminal cancer or AIDS. Bresnitz said 4 of the New Jersey cases were
pregnant women, none of whom died. Many of the other cases were people with
underlying medical problems, he said.
Linda Doughtery, vice president of the New Jersey Food Council, said her
agency is among those looking to "raise the bar" on food handling in the
industry. "We are on the front line of offering training for food handlers
in New Jersey to upgrade their skills," she said. "It is a priority not
just for the industry, but for the consumer."
