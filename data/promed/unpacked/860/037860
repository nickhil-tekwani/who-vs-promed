Tickborne encephalitis virus threat increasing in Russian regions
----------------------------------------------
MOSCOW: With the summer coming, increasing numbers of people have been
seeking medical care for bites of forest ticks, vectors of viral
encephalitis. A total of 1109 people, including 343 children, contacted
doctors about tick bites in the Angara region of Siberia.
Specialists are concerned because it appears that tick activity in cities
is increasing. The situation is not yet critical, however, as the weather
is not very [warm, and despite the fact that last year's grass, a habitat
of ticks, has not been cleared.
Over 750 people suffered tick bites in Karelia. Six have been admitted to
hospital with suspected viral encephalitis. The regional epidemiological
inspection [service said that an estimated 5 to 12 per cent of ticks in
Karelia are infected with tickborne encephalitis virus.
