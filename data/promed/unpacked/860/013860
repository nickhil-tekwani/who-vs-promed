Citrus Canker found north of Orlando
--------------------------
The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services has
verified the presence of citrus canker [CC] on 6 citrus trees in
Orange Park, Clay County, and is taking steps to prevent spread of
the disease. This is the 1st incidence of CC north of Orlando. State
and federal officials are conducting an investigation to determine
how the disease may have gotten into the county.
CC is a bacterial disease which affects only citrus and is not
harmful to humans or animals. It causes lesions on fruit, stems, and
leaves, premature fruit and leaf drop, and it weakens trees, making
them susceptible to other diseases. The Department and the U.S.
Department of Agriculture are involved in an aggressive eradication
program in 22 Florida counties where CC has been detected.
CC was confirmed after a homeowner reported suspicious symptoms of
the disease on a grapefruit tree to a University of Florida/Institute
of Food and Agricultural Sciences extension agent in Clay County.
Inspectors and pathologists from the Department's Division of Plant
Industry (DPI) took samples and later confirmed that the samples were
CC-infected.
Surveys of adjoining properties turned up 6 additional positive trees
on 4 properties. All known positive trees have been removed. The
Citrus Canker Eradication Program requires the state to remove all
citrus trees within 1900 feet of a tree infected with CC. State and
federal inspectors will conduct canker inspections of properties
outside the 1900-foot exposure zone, up to 2 miles.
In recent months, the commercial citrus industry has been hit hard by
CC -- the spread of which can be partially tied to the unprecedented
2004 hurricanes and legal constraints in South Florida which held up
the eradication program for over 2 years. This latest incidence in
Orange Park is likely related to the movement of infected plant
material, another key reason for the further spread of the disease
throughout the state.

[According to James Graham, a professor of plant pathology at the
University of Florida, CC has been present in Florida for over 100
years. He contends that CC may be spreading throughout the state
because humans are the main mode of its spread. Other modes of spread
include overhead irrigation, flooding, insects, and birds.
Long-distance spread of CC has to be managed by preventing the
transportation of infected plant material and by using
decontamination procedures. There is no cure for CC. In areas of the
world where CC is endemic, disease management involves use of
resistant varieties, windbreaks to hinder inoculum dispersal, and the
timely application of copper-containing bactericides. These
strategies are costly and not completely reliable. Currently, the
only management option for CC in Florida is to eradicate the disease.
