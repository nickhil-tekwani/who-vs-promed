With the reference to the regional Emergency Situations Department, Novosti-Kazakhstan reported that over 800 heads of cattle infected with foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] virus will be exterminated in Kazakhstan.

On 5 Jun 2013 the pathology samples of cattle with the primary symptoms of FMD from Tarbagatay district, as well as Zhanaaul and Manyrak rural districts, were sent to the regional veterinary laboratory. The laboratory tests gave a positive result.

"807 heads of cattle which were in contact with infected animals are going to be exterminated in the region," the Emergency Situations Department stated.

A number of measures have been taken to prevent the further spread of the disease.

The regional authorities imposed quarantine measures and stopped the movement of animals and products of animal origin. Veterinarians implement therapeutic activities and vaccinate [see comment] animals against FMD.

[Maps of Kazakhstan can be seen at http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/kazakhst.pdf and http://healthmap.org/r/7d8X. Tarbagatay is one of the 15 districts in the province of East Kazakhstan, which borders, on the east and south east, China's Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region.

A previous FMD outbreak, involving clinical cases in cattle, was reported to the OIE from East Kazakhstan on 14 May 2013. The serotype of the causative FMD virus was not disclosed; this was subject to a request for information (see ProMED-mail archive 20130515.1715748), which is pending, and is relevant also to the current outbreaks.

Several outbreaks of FMD serotype A, topotype Asia, genotype/strain SEA 97 in cattle were reported earlier this year (2013) in the adjacent Chinese province of Xinjiang. This strain, which seems to have spread throughout China, invaded Russia (Zabaykalsky kray) at the beginning of March 2013, as confirmed by genotyping of the Russian and Chinese strains by the WRLFMD, Pirbright.

It is essential to obtain serotyping results of the May 2013 and current FMDV strains from diseased cattle in East Kazakhstan. Genotyping may allow pinpointing their origin.

According to the May 2013 OIE report and the media-derived report above, vaccination in response to the outbreak has been carried out in Kazakhstan. In China, stamping-out policy is applied in relation to the current A strain, probably (but this is in need of clarification) since no potent vaccine has become, so far, available. Have the Kazakh authorities opted for a stamping-out policy, though reportedly vaccination is applied? Which serotype(s) of the FMD virus was/were included in the vaccine used? - Mod.AS]
