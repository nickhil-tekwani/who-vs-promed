Ministry of Health on alert due to cases of rabies
-----------------------------------------
The death of a 13 year old boy as a result of rabies in the city of San
Miguel has put the authorities of the Ministry of Health and the general
population in a state of alert.
The boy was bitten 2 months ago in the axilla and shoulder [by a dog]. His
mother brought him to the hospital last week when he had an elevated fever.
The boy died in the San Juan de Dios hospital last Saturday.
The dog that bit the boy also bit 3 other children, 2 brothers of the boy
and a neighbor, but they were all attended to immediately [given post
exposure prophylaxis? - Mod.MPP] and were brought under control for which
they are considered out of danger, the epidemiologist Romulo Vides assured.
Last year the Ministry of health reported cases of human rabies in San
Miguel, San Rafael Oriente, Santa Rosa de Lima, and Concepcion de Oriente.
La Union had the highest indices of rabies infected animals last year. The
Ministry of Health registered 13 positive cases, most in the rural zone. In
Santa Rosa de Lima 11 cases were reported, in Usulutan 9 cases, in Nueva
Guadalupe 7 cases, and in Morazan 3 cases. Most of the animal cases were
dogs, but one carrier in Concepcion de Oriente was a raccoon. In Jocoro
last year there was a "semoviente" reported with the rabies virus.
According to the departmental director of health in La Union, Hector
Aguilar, since last year preventative measures have been taken with respect
to rabies and other [diseases] transmitted by animals, and vaccination of
cats and dogs has been intensified. In San Migule, the Ministry of Health
has assured that 98.8 per cent of dogs in the municipality were vaccinated,
but a serious problem with stray dogs remains. "In all of the
municipalities measures should be adopted to get rid of the stray dogs, as
they constitute a great danger because we are not able to conduct and
register if they are vaccinated and they are potential transmitters of
rabies" said Romulo Vides.
