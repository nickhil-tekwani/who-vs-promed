Polio in the Syrian Arab Republic - update [26 Nov 2013]
--------------------------------------------------------
A total of 17 cases due to wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) have been confirmed in the Syrian Arab Republic. In addition to 15 cases confirmed in Deir Al Zour province, 2 additional cases have been confirmed, one each in rural Damascus and Aleppo, confirming widespread circulation of the virus. The case with most recent onset developed paralysis on [8 Oct 2013].

A comprehensive outbreak response continues to be implemented across the region. 7 countries and territories are holding mass polio vaccination campaigns targeting 22 million children under the age of 5 years. In a joint resolution, all countries of the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region have declared polio eradication to be an emergency, calling for support in negotiating and establishing access to those children who are currently unreached with polio vaccination. WHO and UNICEF are committed to work with all organizations and agencies providing humanitarian assistance to Syrians affected by the conflict to ensure all Syrian children are vaccinated no matter where they live.

It is anticipated that outbreak response will need to continue for at least 6 to 8 months, depending on the area and based on evolving epidemiology.

Given the current situation in the Syrian Arab Republic, frequent population movements across the region and subnational immunity gaps in key areas, the risk of further spread of wild poliovirus across the region is considered to be high. A surveillance alert has been issued for the region to actively search for additional potential cases in addition to implementing the recommended supplementary immunization activities with oral polio vaccine.

Data in WHO as of 27 Nov 2012 for 2012 data and 26 Nov 2013 for 2013 data.

Highlights of the week
----------------------
- In Syria, 4 new wild polio virus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week. New cases in Aleppo and Douma (rural Damascus) indicate that polio is spreading within the country and reaffirm the urgent need to vaccinate all children in Syria, regardless of who controls the area where they are.
- In Kenya, the government declared polio a public health emergency on [22 Nov 2013] and directed the Ministry of Health to fast-track the immunization activities and to ensure the entire country is covered.

Afghanistan
-----------
- No new WPV1 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV cases for 2013 remains 9 (all WPV1). All WPV1 cases in 2013 are reported from Eastern Region, close to the Pakistan border. The most recent WPV1 case had onset of paralysis on [27 Sep 2013] from Chapa Dara district, Kunar province.
- No new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2013 remains 3. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [13 Mar 2013] (from Kandahar, Southern Region).
- Subnational immunization days (SNIDs) were conducted [23-25 Nov 2013] with further SNIDs planned for mid-December [2013].

Nigeria
-------
- No new WPV cases were reported this week. The total number of WPV cases for Nigeria 2013 remains 50 (all WPV1). The most recent WPV1 case in the country had onset of paralysis on [8 Oct 2013] from Kano.
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 remains one (with onset of paralysis on [6 Jun 2013], from Borno).
- SNIDs are planned for early and mid-December [2013].

Pakistan
--------
- One new WPV1 case was reported in the past week from FR Bannu, Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). The total number of WPV1 cases for Pakistan in 2013 is now 64. The most recent WPV1 case had onset of paralysis on [4 Nov 2013] (from FATA).
- 2 new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 is now 43. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis [27 Oct 2013] (from North Waziristan, FATA).
- The situation in North Waziristan is alarming. It is the area with the largest number of children being paralyzed by poliovirus in all of Asia. Immunization activities have been suspended by local leaders since June 2012. It is critical that children in these areas are vaccinated and protected from poliovirus. Immunizations in neighboring high-risk areas are being intensified, to further boost population immunity levels in those areas and prevent further spread of this outbreak.

Chad, Cameroon, and Central African Republic
--------------------------------------------
- In Chad, no new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The most recent WPV case had onset of paralysis on [14 Jun 2012] (WPV1 from Lac). No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 remains 4 (the most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [12 May 2013] from Ennedi). A nationwide immunization campaign was conducted [25-27 Oct 2013]. NIDs were conducted in Chad [22-24 Nov 2013].
- In Cameroon, 2 new WPV1 cases were reported in the past week, both from Malentouen in Ouest region. The total number of WPV1 cases is now 4. The most recent case in Cameroon had onset of paralysis on [30 Oct 2013] (WPV1 from Ouest).
- An outbreak response to the Cameroon cases is currently underway. In 2013, 5 large-scale supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) have already been conducted in Cameroon (in April, May, July, August, and October [2013]), as the country was considered at high-risk of re-infection due to its proximity with Nigeria. SNIDs are planned for early December [2013] followed by NIDs in mid-January and February 2014.
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week in Cameroon. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 remains 4. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [12 Aug 2013] (from Kolfata, Extreme-Nord).
- Central African Republic (CAR) continues to be at serious risk of re-infection due to proximity with Chad and Cameroon, ongoing insecurity and humanitarian crises, and destruction of health infrastructure. To minimize the risk and consequences of potential re-infection, SNIDs were conducted on [30 Sep to 2 Oct 2013] and child health days (CHD) [11-13 Nov 2013]. Further SNIDs are planned for December [2013] with dates and districts to be decided.

Horn of Africa
--------------
- No new WPV1 cases were reported in the past week (from Somalia). The total number of WPV1 cases in the Horn of Africa remains 203 (183 from Somalia, 14 from Kenya, and 6 from Ethiopia). The most recent WPV1 case in the region had onset of paralysis on [9 Oct 2013] (from Lower Shabelle, Somalia).
- Outbreak response across the Horn of Africa is continuing. As a result of concerted outbreak response efforts, the impact of the response is beginning to be seen, as the number of newly-reported cases from Banadir, Somalia (the epicentre of the outbreak) has declined. All efforts continue to be made to reach all children everywhere.

Israel and West Bank and Gaza
-----------------------------
- Although no case of paralytic polio has been reported, environmental surveillance suggests that WPV1 transmission, first detected in February 2013, continues in southern and parts of central Israel. WPV1-positive samples were detected also in West Bank (2 sites) and the Gaza Strip (1 site).
- Since 2005, only inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) has been used for routine childhood immunization in Israel. To interrupt WPV1 transmission, a nationwide supplementary immunization activity (SIA) with bivalent OPV targeting children less than 10 years of age was conducted in August to October [2013].
- Following a consultation with the country's immunization advisory group, the Israeli Ministry of Health has recently decided to re-introduce OPV into the national immunization schedule.
- SIAs in West Bank and Gaza Strip were conducted in early November [2013], with a 2nd round planned for early December [2013].

Middle East
-----------
- In Syria, 4 new WPV1 cases were reported in the past week, 2 from previously infected district Mayadeen in Deir-Al-Zour and one from Douma, rural Damascus and Fardous, Aleppo, respectively. The total number of WPV1 cases is now 17. The new cases in Aleppo and rural Damascus signal that polio is spreading in the country, but are also a sign that workers are actively looking for cases of polio. Prior to the outbreak wild poliovirus was last reported in Syria in 1999.
- In the Middle East, a comprehensive outbreak response continues to be implemented across the region. The large-scale supplementary immunization activity which started in Syria on [24 Oct 2013] to vaccinate 1.6 million children against polio, measles, mumps and rubella, in both government-controlled and contested areas, has been completed.
- 7 countries and territories are holding mass polio vaccination campaigns repeatedly targeting 22 million children under the age of 5 years over the next 6-8 months. In a joint resolution, all countries of the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region have declared polio eradication to be an emergency, calling for support in negotiating and establishing access to those children who are currently unreached with polio vaccination.
- WHO and UNICEF are committed to working with all organizations and agencies providing humanitarian assistance to Syrians affected by the conflict. This includes vaccinating all Syrian children no matter where they are, whether in government or contested areas, or outside Syria.

West Africa
-----------
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The most recent case in the region was a WPV1 from Tahoua province in Niger with onset of paralysis on [15 Nov 2012].
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week from Niger. The country has reported a single case of cVDPV in 2013, with onset of paralysis on [11 Jul 2013]. Genetic sequencing has shown that the virus is related to that seen in Cameroon, Chad, and Nigeria (Borno).
- Multi-country synchronized immunization campaigns were conducted in West Africa [25-28 Oct 2013]. Additional national campaigns were conducted [22-25 Nov 2013].

[There is a "rumor" circulating in the press that there are several cases of polio in a Syrian refugee camp in Austria. This may be related to a report allegedly coming from WHO EURO (European Regional Office): "In parts of Europe where vaccine coverage is low, including Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ukraine, and Austria, immunisation levels may not be high enough to prevent sustained transmission of the polio virus, they stress." (See http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2492502/Syrian-polio-outbreak-danger-Europe-say-infection-experts-World-Health-Organisation-announces-huge-vaccination-programme.html).

Since the last polio update (20 Nov 2017), as of 27 Nov 2013 there have been 7 newly confirmed cases of WPV infection worldwide -- 4 in Syria, 2 in Cameroon, and 1 in Pakistan. (According to the global tally chart presented above, there are only 6 newly confirmed cases included in the total... the case in Pakistan has not been added to the global tally as yet). Of the 4 cases in Syria, 2 are from the previously identified outbreak region, and 2 are from outside the outbreak site, suggesting there is further geographic spread of the virus throughout the country.

As long as there continue to be endemic foci of WPV transmission, areas that have previously interrupted WPV transmission are at risk of re-introduction of WPV transmission within their countries as evidenced by the past 10+ years worth of polio eradication efforts. A recent disturbing observation was the occurrence of continued circulation of WPV in an area using IPV (inactivated polio vaccine). The absence of clinical cases of paralytic disease is a testimony to the efficacy of the IPV vaccine, yet the continued circulation of the WPV in spite of high overall coverages (albeit with small pockets of low vaccination coverage) is disturbing.

For a map showing the geographic locations of all confirmed WPV cases worldwide for 2013 and 2012, see http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek/Poliocasesworldwide.aspx.
On this map, one can see the geographic spread of the WPV in Syria, from the eastern portion of the country to the western portion. - Mod.MPP
