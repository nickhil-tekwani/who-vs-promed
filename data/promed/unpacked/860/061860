[Contrary to some reports that have appeared elsewhere, so far there
is only one confirmed human case of H7N3 avian influenza virus
infection associated with the outbreak in poultry in Norfolk. - mod.CP]


UK: Three Poultry Workers with Conjunctivitis Test Negative for H7N3 Virus
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Three poultry workers who showed signs of illness after a fellow
worker tested positive for H7N3 avian influenza virus infection do
not have the disease, health officials say. The trio displayed
symptoms of conjunctivitis after a bird flu outbreak at a farm in
Norfolk. It comes after another worker at the farm contracted the
less serious H7 strain of the infection in his eyes.

Bird flu - thought to be the H7 strain - has now been detected at 3
poultry farms near Norwich. On Sunday, 2 farms were named as Norfolk
Road Farm and Mowles Manor Farm, both in North Tuddenham. They are
approximately 2 miles away from Witford Lodge Farm, the scene of the
original outbreak last week, where some 35,000 chickens were
slaughtered. [A map of the location of the farms can be found by
accessing the original BBC News report.]

Culling of chickens at Norfolk Road Farm has been taking place, after
preliminary tests indicated they had the H7 strain of bird flu. Both
farms are run by [a] local farmer and his son.

The government said initial tests showed the farms were affected by a
less serious strain than the deadly H5N1 which killed a swan in Fife.
Two free range flocks would be slaughtered, officials said. The
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) said that
preliminary results indicated the farms were affected by the H7N3
strain of avian flu.

Restrictions are now in operation for the 1km area around the
affected sites in Norfolk, trading standards officials have
said. David Collinson, Norfolk County Council's Head of Trading
Standards said the orders meant vehicles passing through the
restricted zone carrying poultry or captive birds should not stop
within it. "The orders advise all bird keepers within a declared
zone to maintain high standards of biosecurity and any movements of
poultry and other captive birds within the zone must be licensed by a
veterinary inspector," he said. He stressed that roads and footpaths
in the zone remained open and there were no restrictions on eggs or
birds bought from any shop in or outside the zones.

Officials have said risk to the public remained "extremely low". H7
avian flu remains largely a disease of birds," said Dr Jonathan Van
Tam, a flu expert at the Health Protection Agency. "The virus does
not transmit easily to humans, as evidenced by the small number of
confirmed infections worldwide to date."

The 3 workers who were suspected of having conjunctivitis work at a
slaughterhouse owned by Banham Poultry, which runs Witford Lodge
Farm. They underwent tests and specimens were sent to the regional
HPA laboratory but the results came back negative and their symptoms
are not linked to bird flu, an HPA spokeswoman said. The strain
found at Witford Lodge Farm, which is in North Tuddenham about 13
miles (20km) west of Norwich, was also the H7 type. It is virulent
among chickens but less of a threat to humans than the H5N1 variant.

Last month a swan in Cellardyke, Fife, tested positive for H5N1 - the
only confirmed case in the UK so far. The H5N1 virus has killed more
than 100 people in Asia. But experts say it does not pose a
large-scale threat to humans as bird flu cannot pass easily from one
person to another.
