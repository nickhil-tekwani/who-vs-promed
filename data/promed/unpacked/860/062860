Vibrio parahaemolyticus from oysters
"As of Friday, a total of 300 people in three states said they were
sickened after eating the oysters ---- 244 cases are in Texas, 53 in
Florida and 3 in Tennessee. --- Restaurants that had received shipments of the
oysters were alerted in California, Colorado, New Mexico and Louisiana.
We are telling people to thoroughly cook Galveston Bay oysters prior to
eating them, said Kirk Wiles, spokesman for the Texas Department of
Health's seafood safety division. Galveston Bay supplies 87% of all oysters
harvested each year in Texas, producing 3.4 million pounds of meat worth
$8.7 million in 1997. State officials say that more than half the oysters
eaten raw in the nation come from Texas.
The voluntary ban on oyster harvesting is expected to cause serious
financial losses to the local oyster businesses."
The Chronicle reports that anyone with appropriate symptoms (diarrhea,
abdominal cramps, nausea, fever, vomiting, headache) within a day or two of
eating raw oysters should call state officials at 1-888-883-9997.

[Considering the present lack of rain on the Gulf Coast and the subsequent
increase in salinity in the oyster bays, it would be surprising if
autochthonous cases were not occurring elsewhere, such as in Louisiana,
Alabama, and the panhandle of Florida. - Mod.MHJ
