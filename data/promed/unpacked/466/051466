More than 300 Cambodian schoolchildren and teachers were rushed to hospital
after being mysteriously poisoned, health officials said Wednesday.
Minister of Health Hong Sun Huot said an investigation had been launched
into the mass poisoning Sunday in coastal Kampot province.
"We think the poison was from a communal drinking water basin, and caused
over 300 schoolchildren to fall sick," he said. "Luckily nobody has died."
The minister said the children were struck by headaches, dizziness, and
vomiting. "We are now doing experiments to find out what kind of poison. We
don't know whether it was intentional or not. I hope to know the result soon."
Health officials said the poisoning was the first of its kind in Cambodia.
Earlier this year hundreds of Vietnamese schoolchildren were sickened by a
mysterious spate of poisonings.

[If anybody knows what the cause was of the Vietnam episode, we would be
glad to hear it. Since it appears the Cambodian episode has been difficult
to diagnose, the possibility of Norwalk virus infection should be
considered. Alternatively, mass hysteria triggered by an odor might be the
cause. This is a well-known phenomenon in schools around the world,
including the USA.
Did all of the school children drink from the same water basin, or is this
a problem throughout the drinking water system in this school? This article
does not tell us how rapidly the children became ill, nor how serious the
illness is. Consequently, there are many toxins and bacterial diseases on
the list of possibilities. - Mods.JW,TG]
