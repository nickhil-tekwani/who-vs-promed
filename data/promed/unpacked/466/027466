Darfur region governor Mr MA Minawi sent out a tweet about the deaths of 20 pregnant women as a complication of hepatitis E virus infection (HEV), which is currently spreading in some localities of North Darfur State. He urged citizens to take precautionary measures for safe drinking water supplies and appealed to the NGOs for more help.

[Hepatitis E is found worldwide, and different genotypes of the hepatitis E virus determine differences in epidemiology, including genotypes that are zoonotic. For example, genotype 1 is usually seen in developing countries and causes community-level outbreaks, whereas zoonotic genotype 3 is usually seen in developed countries and does not cause outbreaks. Acute epidemic hepatitis E is attributable to infection with hepatitis E virus genotypes 1 and 2. Many of the deaths are in pregnant women, characteristic of genotype 1.

This following article provides some important potential insight into why there is a substantial increased maternal mortality rate related to hepatitis E virus:

Abstract
--------
"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is severe during pregnancy, with a pregnant case fatality rate around 30%. In Bangladesh, plasma samples from 1100 women during the 1st trimester (TM) and 3rd TM of pregnancy and 3 months postpartum (PP) were tested for anti-HEV IgG. During this time, 40 women developed antibody responses to HEV. These seroconverters are classified as the cases (incidence = 46 infections per 1000 person-years). All except one seroconversion occurred between the 3rd TM and 3 months PP. The cases and 40 matched non-seroconverters (controls) underwent analysis of a panel of 10 cytokines, 12 vitamins and minerals, and 2 markers of inflammation. Throughout pregnancy, seroconverting cases displayed higher concentrations of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines compared with the non-seroconverting controls, even prior to infection. In the 1st TM, seroconverters had lower circulating zinc concentrations (P = 0.03), an increased prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)2D] less than 50 nmol/L, P = 0.08), and anemia (hemoglobin less than 110 g/L, P = 0.05) compared with controls. There were no differences in C-reactive protein or alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Antecedent micronutrient deficiencies may lead to dysregulated cytokine expression and immunologic compromise, increasing the risk of HEV infection, especially during pregnancy. This exploratory analysis reveals potential novel associations that deserve further study."

The highest seroprevalence rates (number of persons in a population who test positive for the disease) are observed in regions where low standards of sanitation, such as occurs with displaced populations, increase the risk for transmission of the virus.

North Darfur State is one of the wilayat or states of Sudan. It is one of the 5 states composing the Darfur region and is adjacent to Chad, where HEV is also occurring. - Mod.LL
