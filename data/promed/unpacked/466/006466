Three Australian passengers from a P&O cruise ship have contracted typhoid,
sparking a national health alert.
At least three people who had been aboard the Fair Princess contracted the
disease, possibly during a stopover in Papua New Guinea, the Communicable
Diseases Network of Australia New Zealand (CDNANZ) said last night. Two
confirmed cases are a man and woman from Victoria and a person from Sydney.
CDNANZ said the three infected passengers - all of whom had since been
hospitalised - were on a Kokoda Trail tour on May 14, which authorities
believed could be the source of the outbreak.
