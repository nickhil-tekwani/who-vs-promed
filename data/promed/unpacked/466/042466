England: outbreak of norovirus infection affects Dorset primary school
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Pupils and staff members at a primary school have been struck down with the
highly infectious norovirus, a council said today. The number of pupils and
staff at Christ the King Catholic Primary School in Bournemouth [Dorset]
suffering from gastric illness has risen to 64. The first outbreak was
reported on 30 Jun 2004 when 40 people began suffering from vomiting,
diarrhoea, headaches, stomach pains, aching muscles and a fever. The school
contacted Dorset and Somerset Health Protection Unit, which diagnosed
norovirus infection. Norovirus usually emerges in communal places such as
hospitals, schools, nursing homes and even cruise ships.
The infected children, aged between 4 and 11 years, have been told to stay
off school for at least 48 hours to reduce the spread of the virus. The
school has also sent a letter to parents of the 480 pupils advising them to
wash their hands after going to the toilet and before preparing food for
others in order to stop the illness from spreading. The symptoms can be
severe but usually clear up within 12 to 48 hours.
The Health Protection Agency was working with the school to investigate the
outbreak and identify its source. A council spokeswoman said: "It's one of
those things that just has to run its course. There is nothing much more we
can do apart from make sure any new cases are seen quite quickly."
