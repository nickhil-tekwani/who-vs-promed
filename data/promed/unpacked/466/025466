Exactly 16 months after confirmation of the 1st case of BTV-8 infection in
livestock in western Europe, there are still many questions that need to be
looked into and answered. The efforts of individuals trying to shed light
on the facts surrounding this disease new to Europe are very much
appreciated, but of concern is the lack of consistent scientific
information. The European epidemic shows some patterns very different from
the findings established in countries where bluetongue has been endemic for
centuries. For instance, transmission of the virus has still occurred in
regions where temperatures have been below 11.6 C for at least 8 weeks with
an average temperature of 4.7 C, while so far a minimum temperature for
vector activity of 12 C and for virus replication of 15 C was agreed on by
the scientific community.

How is infection maintained during the colder time of the year?

BTV-8 is different in that many more cattle show severe clinical signs of
disease in a way not experienced in any other outbreak of bluetongue. What
are the long term effects on cattle health and productivity? What are the
effects on the fetus, depending on the state of pregnancy of the dam when
infected? Is re-infection with the same serotype on a wide scale possible,
as allegedly experienced by some farmers?

So far, only very few researchers and experts have contributed to the
discussion, a very sad development, especially as the livelihood of farmers
and the well-being of farm animals is at stake.

[The concern expressed by Sabine Zentis, who runs a pedigree herd of
longhorns in Germany and is an active member of the European Livestock
Association (ELA), is undoubtedly justified. There is clear need for
enhanced research efforts addressing the epidemiology of BTV-8 within the
European realm, in particular related to its entomological aspects,
over-wintering mechanism and genetic susceptibility. Direct and closer
contact between field and laboratory, farm and researcher is required. The
livelihood of thousands (probably more than 10 000; the absence of exact
figures is another manifestation of the deficient investigation effort) of
animal breeders in 8 European countries has been severely affected by BTV-8
since its initial discovery (Belgium, August 2006). Animal suffering is
another issue.

The 2nd disease season is about to terminate, while prospects for 2008 are
rather bleak, particularly in areas -- such as Wales and Scotland, but also
in other vast regions -- where large populations of susceptible animals may
be exposed to BTV-8 for the 1st time next year [2008], while their
preventive vaccination has not yet been secured.

To help close the gap between gained information and its early field
utilization, ProMED-mail is offering its services for the early publication
of preliminary results, provided they address field-related issues and are
of a problem-solving nature; for example, see ProMED-mail's posting

An investigation has begun to establish how an infected cow from Germany
was allowed to bring bluetongue to a farm in Middlesbrough last week. The
cow, imported from Lower Saxony, inside Germany's bluetongue zone was
culled after post-import testing showed it had been infected. The
revelation has led to questions over the safety of allowing animals from EU
bluetongue zones into free areas of the UK.

David Hugill, NFU county chairman for North Yorkshire and Durham said: "I
would be very interested to know why it has not been picked up in Germany.
DEFRA [Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] needs to make
sure that other countries are testing animals as rigorously as we would
expect; obviously, one has got through the net this time, and we must not
allow that to happen again."

An investigation is now under way to determine how the infected cow passed
a veterinary inspection in Germany before being exported here.

A spokesperson for DEFRA said: "Under the EU Bluetongue Regulation,
susceptible animals are permitted to move out of Restricted Zones into Free
Areas, provided an official veterinarian of the exporting country certifies
that all the necessary conditions have been met. Investigations are
currently underway to determine the precise circumstances under which these
animals were exported from Germany."

Despite the arrival of the virus in the area, the bluetongue protection
zone will not be extended up the east coast to Middlesbrough, as it is
believed to be an isolated case.

Mr Hugil said: "Farmers in this area will be very pleased DEFRA has taken
the sensible decision not to extend the zones. The last thing we want after
the summer we have had with foot and mouth is yet more restrictions on our
farmers. We have a strong trade with Scotland from the northeast, and that
is certainly something we wouldn't want to lose because of unnecessary
movement restrictions."
