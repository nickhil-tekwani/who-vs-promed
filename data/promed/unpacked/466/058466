In relation to the questions posed by Prof. Morris [see: Influenza A
(H1N1) "swine flu": worldwide (03) archived as 20090428.1600]: My
group and I are analyzing the recent sequences from the isolates in
Texas and California of swine H1N1 deposited in National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (A/California/ 04/2009(H1N1),
A/California/05/2009(H1N1), A/California/ 06/2009(H1N1),
A/California/07/2009(H1N1), A/California/ 09/2009(H1N1),
A/Texas/04/2009(H1N1) and A/Texas/05/2009(H1N1).

The preliminary analysis using all the sequences in public databases
(NCBI) suggests that all segments are of swine origin. NA and MP seem
related to Asian/European swine and the rest to North American swine
(H1N2 and H3N2 swine viruses isolated since 1998). There is also
interesting substratification between these groups, suggesting a
multiple reassortment.

We are puzzled about sources of information that affirm that the
virus is a reassortment of avian, human and swine viruses. It is true
that the H3N2 swine virus from 1998 and 1999 is a triple reassortant,
but all the related isolates are found since then in swine.

[ProMED-mail thanks Raul Rabadan for the prompt response to Professor
Morris's query in the ProMED-mail post titled "Influenza A (H1N1)
"swine flu": worldwide (03), archived as 20090428.1600 requesting
information on the nature of the genome of the virus responsible for
the outbreak in Mexico and beyond. The analysis of Dr. Rabadan and
colleagues is surprising in view of previous statements which have
gained currency that the genome of this virus is comprised of
components derived directly from avian, human and swine sources. We
look forward to seeing a detailed account of this new analysis. -
