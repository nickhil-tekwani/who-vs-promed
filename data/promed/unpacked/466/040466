A fatal case of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in a horse from the
Beaverton/Edenville area in Midland County [Michigan] has been
identified by the Michigan State University Diagnostic Center for
Population and Animal Health labs.

Eastern equine encephalitis is a virus transmitted by mosquito bites
and can be deadly to horses, deer, birds, and humans. EEE is a rare
illness in humans, and only a few cases are reported in the United
States each year. There is no human-human or horse-horse transmission
of EEE; mosquitoes must get the virus from infected birds.

The mosquitoes and birds that maintain EEE breed in cedar swamps,
bogs, and cattail marshes. People living near such areas, especially
children and the elderly are most susceptible.

The risk of further transmission this year [2011] is low as the
mosquitoes that transmit EEE have declined significantly over the last
month and virus replication will slow down as temperatures decrease, a
spokesperson said.

"Make sure your horses are vaccinated and take precautions against
mosquito bites," the spokesperson said.

In response to the relatively high mosquito populations this year
[2011], Midland County Mosquito Control has conducted extensive ultra
low volume fogging in the Edenville area. Surveillance efforts will be
stepped up in this area and treatment will continue as necessary, the
spokesman said.

Residents with questions about treatment schedules can call the news
hotline at 832-NEWS (832-6397) or check the mosquito control website

[Mosquitoes can breed anywhere there is standing water. It may be in
an old tire, or the overflow bowl on potted plants. It does not
necessarily have to be in swampy areas. Many birds are capable of
carrying the virus, not just birds in swampy areas.

There is a vaccine for horses. Horse owners are encouraged to vaccine
their animals. Immunity is not immediate and at least 2 injections are
recommended for protection from the virus. EEE vaccine is often
combined with West Nile virus (WNV), another mosquito borne virus that
can be fatal to horses.

People are urged to take precautions. Do not be out when the
population of mosquitoes is most active, around dusk and dawn, wear
long sleeves, and use repellant containing DEET. - Mod.TG]
