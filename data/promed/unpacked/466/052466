Abstract
--------
Background: Recent data suggest that complications and death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may be related to high viral loads.

Methods: In this ongoing, double-blind, phase 1-3 trial involving nonhospitalized patients with COVID-19, we investigated 2 fully human, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein, used in a combined cocktail (REGN-COV2) to reduce the risk of the emergence of treatment-resistant mutant virus. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive placebo, 2.4 g of REGN-COV2, or 8.0 g of REGN-COV2 and were prospectively characterized at baseline for endogenous immune response against SARS-CoV-2 (serum antibody-positive or serum antibody-negative). Key end points included the time-weighted average change from baseline in viral load from day 1 through day 7 and the percentage of patients with at least one COVID-19-related medically attended visit through day 29. Safety was assessed in all patients.

Results: Data from 275 patients are reported. The least-squares mean difference (combined REGN-COV2 dose groups vs placebo group) in the time-weighted average change in viral load from day 1 through day 7 was -0.56 log10 copies per milliliter (95% confidence interval [CI], -1.02 to -0.11) among patients who were serum antibody-negative at baseline and -0.41 log10 copies per milliliter (95% CI, -0.71 to -0.10) in the overall trial population. In the overall trial population, 6% of the patients in the placebo group and 3% of the patients in the combined REGN-COV2 dose groups reported at least one medically attended visit; among patients who were serum antibody-negative at baseline, the corresponding percentages were 15% and 6% (difference, -9 percentage points; 95% CI, -29 to 11). The percentages of patients with hypersensitivity reactions, infusion-related reactions, and other adverse events were similar in the combined REGN-COV2 dose groups and the placebo group.

Conclusions: In this interim analysis, the REGN-COV2 antibody cocktail reduced viral load, with a greater effect in patients whose immune response had not yet been initiated or who had a high viral load at baseline. Safety outcomes were similar in the combined REGN-COV2 dose groups and the placebo group.

[There had also been a clinical trial on the use of this cocktail in individuals with severe illness. That trial was halted for safety concerns, with the results showing it was unlikely to prevent those with severe disease to recover (see COVID-19 update (466): antibody trial, Kenya, WHO, global 20201102.7908743). The potential benefits of the treatment with these antibodies in individuals with mild disease accompanied by high viral loads and slow immune responses are promising -- a possible early intervention that could prevent progression to more severe disease. - Mod.MPP]

[2] USA: COVID-19 leading cause of death - JAMA
[A] Viewpoint
Date: Thu 17 Dec 2020

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2774465


Citation: Woolf SH, Chapman DA, Lee JH. COVID-19 as the leading cause of death in the United States. JAMA. Epub 17 Dec 2020. doi: 10.1001/jama.2020.24865

The current exponential increase in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is reaching a calamitous scale in the USA, potentially overwhelming the healthcare system and causing substantial loss of life. The news media dutifully report each day's increase in new cases and deaths, but putting these numbers in perspective may be difficult. The daily US mortality rate for COVID-19 deaths is equivalent to the 11 Sep 2001 attacks, which claimed 2988 lives (1 [see source URL for complete references]), occurring every 1.5 days, or 15 Airbus 320 jetliners (2), each carrying 150 passengers, crashing every day.

A helpful approach to put the effects of the pandemic in context is to compare COVID-19-related mortality rates with the leading causes of death that, under ordinary circumstances, would pose the greatest threat to different age-groups (3). The conditions listed in the Table [see source URL] include the 3 leading causes of death in each of the 10 age-groups from infancy to old age. Using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Table shows mortality rates for these conditions during the period of March through October 2018 (4) (the most recent year for which detailed cause-of-death data are available) with COVID-19 mortality rates during March through October 2020 (5).

The Table shows that by October 2020 COVID-19 had become the 3rd leading cause of death for persons aged 45 through 84 years and the 2nd leading cause of death for those aged 85 years or older. Adults 45 years or older were more likely to die from COVID-19 during those months than from chronic lower respiratory disease, transport accidents (e.g., motor vehicle fatalities), drug overdoses, suicide, or homicide. In contrast, for individuals younger than age 45 years, other causes of death, such as drug overdoses, suicide, transport accidents, cancer, and homicide exceeded those from COVID-19.

Especially for older adults, the threat from COVID-19 may be even greater, for 3 reasons. First, the Table presents the aggregate 8-month mortality rate for COVID-19, not the current mortality rate, which has been increasing rapidly. Between 1 Nov 2020, and 13 Dec 2020, the 7-day moving average for daily COVID-19 deaths tripled, from 826 to 2430 deaths per day, and if this trend is unabated will soon surpass the daily rate observed at the height of the spring surge (2856 deaths per day on 21 Apr 2020) (6). As occurred in the spring, COVID-19 has become the leading cause of death in the USA (daily mortality rates for heart disease and cancer, which for decades have been the 2 leading causes of death, are approximately 1700 and 1600 deaths per day, respectively; 4). With COVID-19 mortality rates now exceeding these thresholds, this infectious disease has become deadlier than heart disease and cancer, and its lethality may increase further as transmission increases with holiday travel and gatherings and with the intensified indoor exposure that winter brings.

Second, the reported number of COVID-19 deaths underestimates the excess deaths produced by the pandemic. Due to reporting delays and miscoding of COVID-19 deaths and an increase in non-COVID-19 deaths caused by disruptions produced by the pandemic, excess deaths are estimated to be 20% higher than publicly reported COVID-19 death counts (7).

Third, COVID-19 is unlike other causes of death in the Table because it is communicable; individuals who die from homicide or cancer do not transmit the risk of morbidity or mortality to those nearby. Every COVID-19 death signals the possibility of more deaths among close contacts.

The failure of the public and its leaders to take adequate steps to prevent viral transmission has made the nation more vulnerable, allowing COVID-19 to become the leading cause of death in the USA, particularly among those aged 35 years or older. Much of this escalation was preventable, as is true for many deaths to come. The prospect of a vaccine offers hope for 2021, but that solution will not come soon enough to avoid catastrophic increases in COVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths. The need for the entire population to take the disease seriously -- notably to wear masks and maintain social distance -- could not be more urgent.

[B] Editorial

Citation: Koh HK, Geller AC, VanderWeele TJ. Deaths from COVID-19. JAMA. Epub 17 Dec 2020. doi: 10.1001/jama.2020.25381

In any year, keeping track of new health trends can be difficult. But this year [2020], the dynamic nature of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has made clarity almost impossible. Declines in mortality, after daily COVID-19-related deaths peaked last spring, initially fueled hope that the worst was over. But following a summer increase in deaths, trends have accelerated even faster. This fall, a million new cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, which previously had increased monthly, began appearing weekly; as of 13 Dec 2020, cumulative infections totaled more than 16 million in the USA (1 [see source URL for complete references]). Meanwhile, the media regularly report a flood of statistics that can be difficult to contextualize.

In this issue of JAMA, the simple, yet powerful, analysis by Woolf et al. (2) [part [A] above] puts these numbers into perspective. Ranking the once unfamiliar threat of COVID-19 against more familiar illnesses, they compare US mortality from COVID-19 (March-October 2020) with leading causes of death 2 years before the pandemic (March-October 2018). The analysis (2), combined with their prior research on death and life expectancy trends (2-4), suggests 4 major conclusions.

First, COVID-19 ranks as a leading cause of death; at certain times, it is the leading cause of death. Compared with leading causes of death from the same period in 2018, novel COVID-19 was the 3rd leading cause of death for children and adults (697.5 deaths/million), ranking behind only heart disease (1287.7 deaths/million) and cancer (1219.8 deaths/million) (2). No age-group has been spared, although COVID-19 was not the leading cause of death for the younger age-groups. These figures probably underestimate true excess mortality by at least 20%, due, in part, to the indirect effects of the pandemic on non-COVID-19 deaths (2), including the death risk that lethal communicable diseases pose to others.

Woolf et al. note that the rapidly rising death rates this fall will exceed spring death rates when COVID-19 was the leading cause of death. Between 1 Nov 2020 and 8 Dec 2020, the 7-day average for daily COVID-19 deaths nearly tripled -- 826 to 2226 deaths per day (2). Daily deaths in the first 13 days of December [2020] averaged 2381 per day (1), already well exceeding the 1900 average daily deaths during the initial peak from 15 Apr 2020 to 15 May 2002 (1). On 9 Dec 2020, deaths reached a record high of 3411 (1), more than 2 per minute and roughly 400 more than the 11 Sep 2001 attack (2). Such numbers elevate COVID-19 as a cause of death higher than heart disease and cancer, which, for decades, accounted for 1700 and 1600 deaths per day, respectively (2).

Cumulative COVID-19 deaths in the USA just surpassed 300 000 on 14 Dec 2020 (1). The USA, which constitutes 4% of the globe's population, ranks 1st in the world in total pandemic deaths (19% of the global total), with the 12th worst (as of 14 Dec 2020) COVID-19 cumulative mortality rates of all countries (5). The rising deaths have come despite heroic efforts by frontline healthcare professionals, advances in hospital-based COVID-19 care, and therapeutic agents newly authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration, such as monoclonal antibody treatments, remdesivir, and dexamethasone. Notably, mortality statistics fail to capture the full devastation of COVID-19-related morbidity, involving not only physical health but also the emotional, social, and spiritual dimensions of well-being.

The fall surge in COVID-19 mortality reflects previously unseen omnipresent disease. Although the spring surge generated deaths largely in New York, parts of New England, Louisiana, and Georgia, the fall surge is widespread nationally, with hot spots in rural states and on both coasts. Notably, people of color have about twice the death rate as White people; 1 in 875 Black persons and 1 in 925 Indigenous persons have died compared with 1 in 1625 White persons (6). Other at-risk groups include essential workers, prisoners, and prison staff.

Second, risk of COVID-19 death is highest among the oldest and lowest among the youngest populations. Age makes a major difference in mortality risk. Compared with those aged 18 through 29 years, people between the ages of 75 and 84 years and those 85 years or older have 200 times and 630 times greater average death rates, respectively (7). Nursing home and long-term care facility residents and staff are at high risk, representing only 5% of the population but 38% of deaths (8), with people in about 28 000 long-term care facilities accounting for more than 106 000 deaths (8). In 14 states, at least half of deaths have been linked to nursing homes; in 6 states, the percentage is more than 60%; in 3, 70% or more (8).

In contrast, for people younger than 35 years, Woolf et al. found that deaths from drug overdoses, transport accidents (e.g., motor vehicle fatalities), and suicide exceeded deaths from COVID-19 (2). Recent 2020 data show record overdose deaths with more than 40 states reporting increased mortality (9). Suicide rates, particularly among youth, continue rising (9).

For children and youth, the relative risk of COVID-19 death is lower still. A joint report from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children's Hospital Association notes that as of 3 Dec 2020, 154 children, of more than 1.4 million diagnosed with COVID-19, have died (10). Although children can serve as a vector for illness, school transmission rates have not been as high as initially feared in communities with low background rates. All these emerging data have recently prompted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to recommend that schools should be the last to close and first to reopen during these times.

Third, COVID-19 will further prolong stagnant US life expectancy trends. In earlier research, Woolf et al. documented that while US life expectancy increased rapidly in the 1970s, it advanced more slowly starting in the 1980s, peaked in 2014, and then declined annually for the 3 years after that (4). Their current study results (2) suggest that COVID-19 will only further deter chances of reversing this trend, especially because excess 2020 US mortality has resulted not only from infection but also from conditions (such as heart disease and Alzheimer disease) that possibly went undetected or untreated during the pandemic, as documented in another prior study by Woolf et al. (3).

Fourth, many, if not most, COVID-19-related deaths could have been prevented, showing that critical public health strategies must remain a major societal focus for the present and future. A national plan for a pandemic response must include robust federal coordination of testing capacity so that supply can meet ever-growing demand, better contact tracing, more robust supplies of personal protective equipment, and heightened emphasis on social distancing that includes travel precautions for the ongoing holiday season. With only 37 states currently having statewide facial covering mandates, President-elect Biden has announced his intention to ask all US residents to wear a mask for his first 100 days in office.

So far, one vaccine candidate has received FDA Emergency Use Authorization with more likely in the coming days. The CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has just recommended prioritizing frontline healthcare workers and residents in nursing homes and long-term care facilities. Because widespread vaccine availability may not be possible for months, the next phase could include prioritizing older individuals with chronic conditions and essential workers. This should be combined with dedicated outreach to regain the trust required to reach communities of color, which have historically had lower vaccination rates. Meanwhile, broad public health precautions cannot be relaxed.

Ultimately, containing the pandemic will require national coordination of federal, state, and local leaders; dedicated resources for overwhelmed healthcare workers and hospitals; renewed support for underresourced state and local public health officials; and a coronavirus stimulus package that aids struggling schools and businesses, as well as the millions of people on the brink of eviction.

The year 2020 ends with COVID-19 massively surging, as it was in the spring, to be the leading cause of death. The accelerating numbers of deaths fall far short of fully capturing each devastating human story: every death represents untold loss for countless families. Ending this crisis will require not only further advances in treatment but also unprecedented commitment to all aspects of prevention, vaccination, and public health. Only by doing so can future years see this illness revert back to the unfamiliar and unknown condition it once was.

Screening in Samut Sakhon province found 13 people infected with COVID-19
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Three mobile testing vehicles arrived at Samut Sakhon. About 4000 people were found to be related to the shrimp market (where the local case worked), and out of 2000 people were tested, 13 were found to have COVID-19. Nonetheless, the authorities remarked that the outbreak was under control and people could still travel to the province.

Elderly relatives of COVID-infected shrimp vendor also test positive
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Three close relatives of a COVID-19-infected shrimp wholesaler at a market in Samut Sakhon have also tested positive for the virus. The shrimp market, meanwhile, has been closed for thorough cleansing.

The 67-year-old vendor's 95-year-old bed-ridden mother, her elder sister, aged 73, and her sister-in-law, 57, were found to be also infected, Dr. Sophon Iamsirithaworn, director general of the Communicable Diseases Division, said on Friday [18 Dec 2020].

The woman owns a stall at the Talad Klang Kung, or Central Shrimp Market, in Samut Sakhon and fell ill on 13 Dec 2020, with muscle pains and loss of sense of smell, he said. She had not travelled abroad, Dr. Sophon said. She was at the shrimp market every day, from 6 am to 11 am.

The woman was among 16 new COVID-19 cases reported on Friday [18 Dec 2020] by the Centre for COVID-19 Situation Administration. On 16 Dec 2020, she went to a private hospital's outpatient department around 6 pm and was tested for COVID-19. Around 10 pm, the test came back positive. The hospital then sent samples for testing at another lab, at a medical sciences centre, and the result also came back positive. The woman was admitted to Samut Sakhon Hospital around 2 am on 17 Dec 2020, Dr. Sophon said.

Contact tracers found a total of 26 people were at high risk of infection. They were divided into 4 groups.
- The 1st group comprised 7 family members, and 3 of them later tested positive.
- The 2nd group consisted of 3 people who worked at her shrimp stall, her 39-year-old son and 2 Myanmar workers. Officials were awaiting their test results.
- A 3rd group comprised 8 medical staff at the private hospital, and all tested negative.
- The 4th group were 8 people who worked at the shrimp market. Officials were awaiting their test results.

There were 139 people who were at low risk, he said. Dr. Sophon said the shrimp market had been closed for 3 days for cleaning. He made no mention of how the stall owner may have caught the virus.

Amphai Harnkraiwilai, chairwoman of Mahachai fisheries development cooperative, on Friday [18 Dec 2020] made a point of explaining that the infected woman did not work at the province's Talad Talay Thai market, or Thai Seafood Market, which is popular with tourists. Talad Talay Thai enforced health measures such as wearing of masks, temperature screening and hand washing, with hand sinks, hand gel and soap at 6 spots at the market, Ms. Amphai told reporters. She wanted to clear up any confusion about the location, she said.

One local infection among 16 new COVID cases
--------------------------------------------
One new local infection was among 16 new COVID-19 cases reported on Friday [18 Dec 2020], raising the total to 4297.

The Centre for COVID-19 Situation Administration (CCSA) said the local infection was the 67-year-old owner of a stall at the wholesale shrimp market in Samut Sakhon. She was being treated at Samut Sakhon Hospital. The case was reported on Thursday [17 Dec 2020] but not included in the tally until Friday [18 Dec 2020].

The 15 other new cases were among people arriving from India, Myanmar, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom.

The case from India was a 22-year-old Indian male student. He stayed at an alternative quarantine facility in Bangkok.

There were 4 Thai women from Myanmar, 2 aged 25, one aged 36, the other 41. All were quarantined in Chiang Rai [province].

The case from the Netherlands was a Swiss man, 63. He stayed at an alternative quarantine facility in Bangkok.

There were 2 cases from Switzerland, a 2-year-old girl and a 61-year-old man, both Swiss nationals. They stayed at a state quarantine facility in Bangkok.

The case from Turkey was a 27-year-old Belarus woman. She stayed at an alternative quarantine facility in Bangkok.

There were 5 cases from Saudi Arabia, all Thai nationals. They were a 9-year-old boy, girls aged 5 and 10, and 2 teachers, aged 28 and 29. All were quarantined in Chon Buri.

The case from the UK was a 24-year-old Thai woman working as a fitness trainer. She was quarantined in Bangkok.

Of the 4297 people diagnosed with COVID-19, 4005 (93%) have recovered, including 16 discharged from hospitals over the past 24 hours, and 232 people remain in hospitals, the CCSA said. The death toll remains at 60.

Global COVID-19 cases rose by 721 392 over the previous 24 hours to 75.27 million. The worldwide death toll soared by 12 825 to 1.66 million. The USA had the most cases at 17.62 million, up 230 982. India came 2nd with 9.97 million, up 26 762. Thailand ranked 152nd.

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (261 583), Brazil (52 385), and Germany (31 553) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 12 909 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (17-18 Dec 2020).

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (15 countries) include the USA, Brazil, Germany, Russia (28 552), UK (28 507), India (26 991), Turkey (26 410), France (15 674), Italy (15 401), Colombia (13 277), Ukraine (12 630), Mexico (12 248), Netherlands (11 931), Spain (11 815), and Poland (11 010). A total of 60 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 31 of the 60 countries reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 11 are from the Americas region, 9 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 4 are from the South East Asia region, 4 are from the Western Pacific region, and 1 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 12.2%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 4.1%. (These calculations are reflecting the addition of 823 225 backlogged cases from Turkey 9 days ago). The USA has increased both newly confirmed cases (4.6%) and reported deaths (5.2%).

Impression: The global daily reported cases continue to increase with over 732 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, South East Asia, and Western Pacific regions. The USA continues to show high levels of transmission that may be leveling off post Thanksgiving holiday weekend. - Mod.MPP]
