Guar crop plagued by 'disease'
------------------------------
The bid by farmers to diversify is under a cloud, after the guar crop, which the farmers had sown in place of paddy [rice], has been attacked by a disease of which the farmers and authorities seem to know little.

The crop fetches a very high price as it is exported to nations like the US. With the guar under attack, however, both the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) and the Department of Agriculture are at a loss and the farmers now stand to lose their crop.

Recently, the leaves of the crop started curling and the plant started dying out, said a farmer. The farmers also say that a booklet [by PAU] with guidelines on crops does not say much about guar. PAU assured that the matter will be addressed.

[Guar bean (_Cyamopsis tetragonoloba_; also called cluster bean) is a tropical, but fairly drought tolerant annual legume and an important crop in India and Pakistan. It is used as food (vegetable, guar gum from seeds as food additive), animal feed, and green manure in organic agriculture. Gum derivatives have industrial uses for example in paper, textile, and mining industries. India is the main producer of guar with 80 percent of world production, and demand has been increasing in the US and other developed countries.

A leaf curl disease of the crop was reported from India earlier (see link below) with symptoms of curling, shortening and malformation of leaves, shortening of internodes and stems, with overall stunting of diseased plants. An isolate of _Tomato leaf curl virus_ (TLCV; genus _Begomovirus_) was identified as the cause, transmitted by whiteflies. With leaf curl symptoms described above, this may be the disease currently observed in Punjab.

Several other viruses, as well as bacterial (_Xanthomonas_) blight and fungal leaf and root diseases have also been reported to affect guar. Reliable diagnosis will be crucial for disease control in Punjab.
