[From July to November 2019, Serbia reported 18 outbreaks of ASF. See event summary, all follow-up reports and updated map at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=31342.

"In Europe and Asia, wild boar has become an epidemiological reservoir of the virus, contracting, carrying and spreading African swine fever. The virus has taken advantage of the recent increase in density and distribution of the population. In this scenario, any domestic pig living in an area where there is infected wild boar is at risk of being infected.

"A new publication from FAO, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), and the European Commission (EC) aims to assist veterinary services, wildlife management authorities, and institutions dealing with ASF prevention and control, including hunters, who are often a key part of the response when ASF is detected in wild boar populations. "African Swine Fever in wild boar: Ecology and biosecurity", provides an overview of epidemiological features and ecology of African swine fever and shares recent experiences in prevention and control of ASF in wild boar in Europe".
