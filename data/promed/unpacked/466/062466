PARATUBERCULOSIS & CROHN'S DISEASE
==================================
This is concerning a note posted a few days ago requesting
information on Crohn's disease in animals.
[see archive.960117 & .960119]
We have found terminal ileitis resembling Crohn's disease in
five tamarin monkeys (4 Saguinus mystax and 1 S. labiatus) at the
Peruvian Primate Center. Clinical symptoms were wasting, chronic
diarrhea, lethargy, reduced appetite, and sparce hair coat followed
by complete loss of hair on the tail. Attempts to isolate
enteropathogenic bacteria and fungi were unsuccesful. Treatment with
antibacterial preparations including Eritromicine and Chloramphenicol
revealed no improvement of the animal's health. At necropsy a mass
consisting of thickened terminal portion of the ileum was found. The
diseased segment was thickened and inflexible like a rubber hose. The
bowel wall tended to maintain the cylindrical shape even after the
bowel was opened. At histologic examination the ileum mucosa was
ulcerated and replaced by debris and a few mononuclear inflammatory
cells, in one case mycotic hyphae and neutrophils were also observed
in the mucosa. A thick prominent infiltrate with mononuclear
inflammatory cells (plasma cells and lymphocytes) was observed
diffusely distributed in the submucosa. There was also extensive
fibrosis, fibroblasts, some foamy macrophages and edema.
As far as I know terminal ileitis resembling Crohn's disease has been
reported only in one dog (Van Kruiningen HJ. Gastroenterol 62:1128-
1142, 1972). However, regional enterocolitis and granulomatous
enteritis have been reported in dogs and horses (Cimprich. Vet
Pathol 11:535-547, 1974; DiBartola et al., JAVMA 181:904-908, 1982;
Merrit et al., JAVMA 169:603-609, 1976; Strande et al., Arch Pathol
57:357-362, 1954; Widmer & Van Kruiningen JAAHA 10:583-585, 1974).
Hope this information is helpful.
