State and federal officials are investigating an outbreak of non-viral hepatitis traced to "Real Water" brand bottled water. Health officials are warning the public to not drink the water. The company has not initiated a recall.

Five children were hospitalized in late 2020 in Clark County, but all of them have recovered, according to a Southern Nevada Health District investigation report. The water is apparently still being sold. The health district, based in Las Vegas, received initial reports of the 5 cases of acute non-viral hepatitis in November 2020.

"The patients lived in 4 different households. 6 additional people have reported experiencing less severe symptoms that include vomiting, nausea, loss of appetite, and fatigue. These patients include 3 adults and 3 children," the health district reported.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is recommending that consumers, restaurants, and retailers discontinue drinking, cooking with, selling, or serving "Real Water" alkaline water to minimize the risk of contracting liver disease.

An investigation update this afternoon [19 Mar 2021] from US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says the consumption of "Real Water" brand alkaline water is the only common link identified among all of the patients. Real Water Inc, headquartered in Mesa, Arizona, owns the "Real Water" brand of alkaline bottled water.

As of this afternoon the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had not posted any information on its work in the outbreak investigation.

The implicated water was distributed in 4 states in 5-gallon [20L) bottles via home delivery subscriptions and nationwide in smaller containers via online sales, according to the FDA.

The 5-gallon containers are delivered to homes in the following areas, according to the firm's website:
- Honolulu, Hawaii, through Aloha Water
- Orange County, California, through Paradise Bottling Co.
- St. George, Utah, through Real Water Southern Utah
- Tucson, Arizona, through Aqua-Pure
- Ventura and Santa Barbara, California, through Real Water Gold Coast

Additionally, according to the firm's website, Real Water is sold in 1 gallon [4L], 500 mL, 1 liter, and 1.5-liter plastic bottles and in a 750 ml glass bottle.

The FDA is investigating the company's facility, according to the update today [19 Mar 2021]. The agency is in the beginning stages of this investigation, and there may be additional products connected to this outbreak.

The Nevada health district is continuing to monitor for cases of acute non-viral hepatitis.

As part of the state investigation, the regional health district has posted an online survey to obtain information to identify possible sources of the pathogen.

"We are administering this brief questionnaire to ask you about you and/or your household member's possible exposures, symptoms, and other information relating to this investigation," the survey page states. "If you and/or your household members had acute non-viral hepatitis-related symptoms after consuming alkaline water, please take this survey [https://survey.alchemer.com/s3/6249720/Non-Viral-Hepatitis-with-Exposure-to-Real-Water]."

Acute non-viral hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver that can be caused by exposure to toxins. Although, hepatitis can have other causes, according to the state update. Symptoms often include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, light-colored stools, joint pain, or yellowing of the skin or eyes. Anyone who is experiencing these symptoms should contact their healthcare provider.

A bottled water company continues to refuse to cooperate with an FDA investigation of non-viral hepatitis. The agency reports that the water is the only common denominator among the outbreak patients.

"Given a lack of cooperation by the firm, FDA investigators have been unable to complete investigations at the 'Real Water' Inc. facilities in Henderson, Nevada, and Mesa, Arizona, and have not been provided with requested records. As a result, on [23 Mar 2021], FDA issued a Demand for Records under section 414 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act," according to the public alert from the Food and Drug Administration.

"Consumption of 'Real Water' brand alkaline water is the only common link identified among all of these cases to date."

Five people in Nevada are confirmed sick from non-viral hepatitis and all 5 have been admitted to hospitals. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is assisting the FDA and the Southern Nevada Health District with the investigation.

The company issued a recall of all of its water [24 Mar 2021]. The products include but are not limited to: 5-gallon containers sold through home delivery/subscription; bottles sold on-line and in stores; and the "Real Water" concentrate sold on-line, according to the FDA.

According to the firm's press release, the recall includes 1.5 liter, 1 liter, 500-mL, and 1 gallon [4L] ready-to-drink alkaline water bottles and 4-ounce [120 mL] bottles of "Real Water" concentrate.

Anyone who has consumed any of the recalled water and developed symptoms of hepatitis should seek medical attention. Also, it can take up to 50 days for symptoms to develop, so anyone who has consumed the water recently should monitor themselves for symptoms in the coming weeks.

Symptoms of all types of hepatitis, including non-viral hepatitis, are similar and can include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, clay or gray-colored bowel movements, joint pain, yellow eyes and/or skin.

https://www.8newsnow.com/news/local-news/real-water-hepatitis-cases-grow-to-11-with-50-more-cases-under-snhd-investigation/


Another 6 cases of hepatitis -- now a total of 11 -- have been linked to Real Water, according to the Southern Nevada Health District (SNHD).

The new cases all involve adults, SNHD reports. The 5 initial cases involved children.

SNHD also said 50 additional reports are currently being investigated. Each of those investigations are based on people who self-identified to the Health District, were reported by a healthcare provider, or because their Real Water subscription was canceled due to health concerns.

"To date, the consumption of 'Real Water' brand alkaline water was found to be the only common link between all the identified cases," according to SNHD. "The FDA is conducting a further investigation into the facility, and the Health District continues to monitor for cases of acute non-viral hepatitis."

The product has prompted health alerts from the Centers for Disease Control telling healthcare providers to be on the lookout for acute non-viral hepatitis cases. That followed warnings from the FDA and SNHD.

Several lawsuits have been filed against the company selling Real Water brand alkaline water. 8NewsNow previously reported a total of 6 lawsuits against the company.

The 11 people were hospitalized, as well as another person who has been called a "suspect case," and have since been released. None of the children or adults required a transplant, according to SNHD.

The ages of the children identified during the initial investigation range from 7 months to 5 years. The ages of the newly identified probable and suspect cases range from 32 to 71 years of age. The most common symptoms reported by the patients included nausea and vomiting, fatigue, loss of appetite, and dizziness.

The FDA has recommended that consumers, restaurants, and retailers discontinue drinking, cooking with, selling, or serving "Real Water" alkaline water. More information on the investigation is available on the FDA's website [https://www.fda.gov/food/outbreaks-foodborne-illness/investigation-acute-non-viral-hepatitis-illnesses-real-water-brand-alkaline-water-march-2021].

Acute non-viral hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver that can be caused by exposure to toxins, autoimmune disease, or drinking too much alcohol.

["You may have heard various health claims about alkaline water. Some say it can help slow the aging process, regulate your body's pH level, and prevent chronic diseases like cancer. But what exactly is alkaline water, and why all the hype?

The "alkaline" in alkaline water refers to its pH level. The pH level is a number that measures how acidic or alkaline a substance is on a scale of 0 to 14. For example, something with a pH of 1 would be very acidic and something with a pH of 13 would be very alkaline.

Alkaline water has a higher pH level than regular drinking water. Because of this, some advocates of alkaline water believe it can neutralize the acid in your body.

Normal drinking water generally has a neutral pH of 7. Alkaline water typically has a pH of 8 or 9. However, pH alone isn't enough to impart substantial alkalinity to water.

Alkaline water must also contain alkaline minerals and negative oxidation reduction potential (ORP). ORP is the ability of water to act as a pro- or antioxidant. The more negative the ORP value, the more antioxidizing it is.

Alkaline water is somewhat controversial. Many health professionals say there isn't enough research to support the many health claims made by users and sellers. Differences in research findings may be related to the types of alkaline water studies.

According to the Mayo Clinic, regular water is best for most people. They state that there is no scientific evidence that fully verifies the claims made by supporters of alkaline water.

However, there are a few studies that suggest alkaline water might be helpful for certain conditions.

For example, a 2012 found that drinking naturally carbonated artesian-well alkaline water with a pH of 8.8 may help deactivate pepsin, the main enzyme that causes acid reflux.

Another study suggested that drinking alkaline ionized water may have benefits for people with high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol.

A more recent study that included 100 people found a significant difference in whole blood viscosity after consuming high-pH water compared to regular water after a strenuous workout. Viscosity is the direct measurement of how efficiently blood flows through the vessels.

Those who consumed high-pH water reduced viscosity by 6.3 percent compared to 3.36 percent with standard purified drinking water. This means blood flowed more efficiently with alkaline water. This can increase oxygen delivery throughout out the body.

However, more research is needed beyond these small studies. In particular, research is needed to answer other claims made by alkaline water supporters.

Despite the lack of proven scientific research, proponents of alkaline water still believe in its proposed health benefits. These include:
- anti-aging properties (via liquid antioxidants that absorb more quickly into the human body)
- colon-cleansing properties
- immune system support
- hydration, skin health, and other detoxifying properties
- weight loss
- cancer resistance

They also argue that soft drinks, which are notoriously acidic, have very positive ORPs leading to many health problems, while properly ionized and alkalinized waters have highly negative ORPs. Green tea is rich in antioxidants and has a slightly negative ORP.

Although alkaline drinking water is considered safe, it may produce negative side effects.

Some examples of negative side effects include the lowering of natural stomach acidity, which helps kill bacteria and expel other undesirable pathogens from entering your bloodstream.

Additionally, an overall excess of alkalinity in the body may cause gastrointestinal issues and skin irritations. Too much alkalinity may also agitate the body's normal pH, leading to metabolic alkalosis, a condition that may produce the following symptoms:
- nausea
- vomiting
- hand tremors
- muscle twitching
- nausea
- vomiting
- hand tremors
- muscle twitching
- tingling in the extremities or face
- confusion

Alkalosis can also cause a decrease in free calcium in the body, which can affect bone health. However, the most common cause of hypocalcemia isn't from drinking alkaline water, but from having an underactive parathyroid gland.

Water that's naturally alkaline occurs when water passes over rocks -- like springs -- and picks up minerals, which increase its alkaline level.

However, many people who drink alkaline water buy alkaline water that's been through a chemical process called electrolysis.

This technique uses a product called an ionizer to raise the pH of regular water. Makers of ionizers say that electricity is used to separate molecules in the water that are more acidic or more alkaline. The acidic water is then funneled out.

Still, some doctors and researchers say these claims aren't backed by quality research. The water quality of the original source, before ionization, is crucial to ensuring contaminants aren't present in the drinking water.

Some scientists advise using reverse-osmosis to adequately purify water before connecting an alkaline ionizer, which can raise pH and add minerals.

A study published by the World Health Organization cautions against drinking water with low mineral content, which is created by reverse osmosis, distillation, and other methods (without additional mineralization) on a regular basis.

Alkaline water can be bought in many grocery or health food stores. It can also be found online.

Water ionizers are sold in many large chain stores as well.

You can also make your own at home. Even though lemon and lime juices are acidic, they contain minerals that can create alkaline byproducts once digested and metabolized. Adding a squeeze of lemon or lime to a glass of water can make your water more alkaline as your body digests it. Adding pH drops or baking soda is another way to make water more alkaline.

If water is properly filtered to remove contaminants, ionized and re-mineralized, or purchased from a quality source, there's no evidence to suggest a limitation on how much alkaline water can be consumed daily.

The issue that many health professionals have with alkaline water isn't its safety, but rather the health claims that are made about it.

There isn't enough scientific evidence to support the use of alkaline water as a treatment for any health condition. Medical experts warn against believing all the marketing claims.

Drinking natural alkaline water is generally considered safe, since it contains natural minerals.

However, you should use caution with artificial alkaline water, which likely contains fewer good minerals than its high pH would have you believe, and may contain contaminants. Also keep in mind, drinking too much alkaline water may leave you deficient in minerals."

This situation has been going on for 6 weeks. It is time for the authorities shed light on the entire situation with this particular water. Non-viral hepatitis from water allegedly believed to be safe, is very unusual. So what is it about this water causing problems? Clearly we know for it to be alkaline the pH is higher than normal, or is it excessively high? Or is there a contaminant in the water? Or is it a situation unique to the individuals affected? Either way, I would think twice about drinking this water until the source of the problem has been located. - Mod.TG
