Australian researchers have developed new diagnostic tests to distinguish
the rare but deadly Australian bat lyssavirus from its overseas cousin,
rabies.
CSIRO's [Commonwealth Scientific Industrial Research Organization's Dr.
Allan Gould last night outlined the research to scientists at the
International Congress of Virology in Sydney. Australian bat lyssavirus is
carried by bats, and has claimed 2 human victims since its discovery in 1996.
"The new diagnostic tests are used in conjunction with
immuno-histochemistry and serological tests to rapidly identify new strains
of the virus in bats or humans, " says Dr. Gould.
"Analysis of the genetic material of Australian bat lyssavirus shows it is
different from classical rabies (a rhabdovirus), and other lyssaviruses.
However, rabies and Australian bat lyssavirus are closely enough related
that the rabies vaccine does offer protection against infection with
Australian bat lyssavirus," Dr. Gould says.
Health authorities have warned all people who come into close contact with
bats to be vaccinated against the disease. Any person who is bitten or
scratched by a bat should immediately wash the wound thoroughly with soap
and water, then urgently seek medical attention, even if they have been
vaccinated. If possible, they should keep the live bat for testing.
The virus is present throughout the range of the bats, including all States
and Territories, with the exception of South Australia and Western
Australia. However, bats from these States have not been fully evaluated.
Dr. Gould says there are two strains of Australian bat lyssavirus, one
carried by insect eating-bats, and the other by fruit-eating bats. "The
virus has adapted itself to the two different types of bats, suggesting
that it has been in Australia for some time, and is not a recent
incursion," Dr. Gould says.
The Australian bat lyssavirus is 1 of 3 new diseases discovered in
Australia this decade that are carried by bats, and infectious to humans.
The first was Hendra virus, which killed a prominent Brisbane horse trainer
and 13 of his horses in 1995. Another man, and 3 horses have died in 2
further incidents of the disease in Australia.
"The earlier outbreak of Hendra virus, with its link with bats, led us to
look more closely at sick bats. In fact Australian bat lyssavirus was first
discovered when a sick bat was sent to CSIRO's Australian Animal Health
Laboratory to test for Hendra virus. The bat was negative for Hendra virus,
but we did find this other new virus, Australian bat lyssavirus," Dr. Gould
says.
Another new Australian virus is the Menangle virus, which also affects
humans, causing flu-like symptoms. It was identified in a single outbreak
of disease in a NSW (New South Wales) piggery in 1997.
