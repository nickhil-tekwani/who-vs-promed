----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Epoch Times report is misleading. According to official information there is no spread of anthrax to Yinchuan city [Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region]. Our MD in Beijing has reviewed a related official Chinese media report and an announcement from the local health Bureau in Yinchuan city:
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA3NDI2ODg5Ng==&mid=2650793830&idx=6&sn=34a74f0e5acbc1ada3a3316bace25513&_sm_au_=iVVJSnsZN4kbK7bN [In Chinese. - Mod.MHJ]

The report confirms that there have been 3 skin anthrax cases in Haiyuan county (some 280 km [approx. 174 mi] from Yinchuan city) detected [11-13 Apr 2018]. One case is from Qiyingzhen [Qiyingz township], and died after he processed a dead cow; the other 2 patients are from Sanhezhen [Sanhez township], and had been infected after working on processing a dead sheep. The patients were evacuated to local hospital (No 4 People Hospital in Yinchuan), in stable medical conditions.

There are no further anthrax cases reported after mid April [2018]. Local health bureau officials confirmed there was no spread to Yinchuan city.

Additionally, a local announcement from health bureau said that in 2017, there were 7 anthrax cases in Ningxia province.

Note that other media reports state that the information circulated on WeChat is false information http://news.sina.com.cn/s/2018-04-19/doc-ifzfkmth6889371.shtml in Chinese. - Mod.MHJ]. For the information published by Kommersant about the cases, which was mentioned in the Epoch Times article, see https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/3619144 [in Russian. - Mod.MHJ]

[Our thanks to Dr Lai for this correction about the false information regarding the human case in Yinchuan city; obviously a confusion arising out of the 2 patients being transferred from Sanhezhen. And also that the latter cases came about from exposure to a dead sheep, not a dead goat. A small point, but sheep graze, and goats browse, so the sheep probably got infected from grazing a piece of contaminated soil. If it had been a goat, they get infected when browsing from consuming the contaminated blood deposited on leaves by blow flies, indicating a recent but unreported death. - Mod.MHJ
