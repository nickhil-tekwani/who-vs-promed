[There are currently 2 main clusters of LSD in the Eastern Hemisphere: a western one in south-east Europe and an eastern one, which started in July 2014 in the Caucasus region, initially in Azerbaijan, followed next year [2015] by other regional countries such as Chechnya, Dagestan, Georgia, Armenia and South Ossetia, continuing later to Russia's southern oblasts (e.g. Stavropol, Krasnodar, Tambov, Voronezh). The disease has spread also further eastwards, penetrating Kazakhstan.

For detailed and recent (since Jan 2016) geographic presentation of the LSD outbreaks in the eastern cluster, please go to OIE's interactive map at http://tinyurl.com/y74bynnq (click on the eastern cluster, zoom in).

The countries in the eastern LSD region benefit from the diagnostic and vaccine-testing capacities of All-Russia's FGBU ("Federal Center for Animal Health", animal health Institute). The vaccine used against LSD in Russia and in its partners is a live attenuated, freeze-dried sheep pox vaccine (details in 20170511.5028821). - Mod.AS
