An ongoing outbreak of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) typhoid fever in Pakistan that has triggered the level 2 alert can be controlled by sensitizing public and health professionals on following preventive measures religiously and offering vaccination particularly to the population at risk. The US CDC has already issued a travel alert saying anyone heading to Pakistan should take extra care of food and water and get vaccination against typhoid. The CDC said the XDR typhoid strain in Pakistan does not respond to many antimicrobials.

Typhoid or enteric fever is a bacterial infection caused by _Salmonella [enterica_ subtype] Typhi. The fecal oral transmission is the commonest route infecting the healthy ones. Contaminated water and food are the main sources for the spread of the infection.

Associate Professor of Pathology and Consultant Microbiologist at Al-Nafees Medical College Islamabad Dr Humaira Zafar expressed this while talking to 'The News' on [Sun 12 Aug 2018]. She said the intestinal tract is the primary site of infection. The most common symptoms include continuous high grade fever, generalized weakness, blood stream infection, and constipation or diarrhea. If the infection prolongs either due to partial treatment, drug resistance or any other cause, a patient can land up to chronic phase along with the emergence of complications. The highlighted complications can be enlargement of the spleen, intestinal haemorrhage, perforation of the bowel, and meningitis (inflammation of outer layers of brain), she explained. She added the mortality rate in untreated or drug resistant cases ranges from 12-30 percent. "Despite the availability of effective antimicrobials, about 200 000 people die annually while in well treated cases, the survival rate is 99 percent."

Typhoid fever is a treatable and curable infection provided accurately treated for proper duration after confirmed diagnosis by culture and sensitivity (blood, stool, and bone marrow), she said. She added that currently the biggest challenge is the emergence of drug resistant strain of _S._ Typhi bacteria. The antimicrobials from the penicillin, quinolones, and cephalosporin groups are usually considered among the good treatment options but the challenge faced for public health concern was the emergence of resistant pattern to 1st line treatment (ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) and the 2nd-line option as well (fluoroquinolones). Due to this situation, ceftriaxone (3rd generation cephalosporin) is considered as the empirical treatment of choice for typhoid fever patients. However, now there is emergence of a strain that is also resistant to ceftriaxone. Thus giving this microbe a label of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) typhoid, said Professor Humaira.

She added the condition severely limits treatment options. The 6 months statistical data of National Institute of Health in Islamabad confirmed about 2000 cases of (XDR) _Salmonella_ Typhi in Pakistan. Emergence of such cases in Pakistan is becoming a global voice and has brought Pakistan in a limelight. The travellers and tourists visiting Pakistan are advised to take additional precautionary measures in order to not acquire infection, she said. The crisis in Pakistan represents the 1st known outbreak of an XDR strain and this state of affairs if not controlled may lead some researchers to warn that it could turn the clock 70 years back when surviving the disease was more a matter of luck than treatment, said Dr Humaira.

This preventable disease can be prevented by preventing fecal contamination in drinking water and food supplies. Since human faeces are the main sources for disease transmission, so awareness regarding practicing hygienic measures like hand washing, waste management, water purification, accurate diagnosis with the help of culture and sensitivity, and proper treatment of the typhoid fever can help control the outbreak and reduce the high mortality rate, she said.

[The following is extracted from the CDC notice regarding this multiply resistant typhoid strain in Pakistan https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/alert/xdr-typhoid-fever-pakistan):

The XDR strain of _Salmonella_ Typhi is resistant to most antibiotics (ampicillin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, and ceftriaxone) used to treat typhoid fever. Health care providers should:
- Obtain a complete travel history (asking about travel to South Asia, including Pakistan) from patients with suspected typhoid fever.
- Collect stool and blood cultures from patients with suspected typhoid fever and request antimicrobial susceptibility testing on isolates.
- Be aware that the Pakistan outbreak strain remains susceptible to azithromycin and carbapenems. Azithromycin is effective for uncomplicated (diarrhea or bacteremia without secondary complications) typhoid fever and should be used to treat patients with suspected uncomplicated typhoid fever who have traveled to Pakistan. When culture and sensitivity results are available, adjust treatment accordingly. Adult azithromycin dosage is usually 1000 mg orally once then 500 mg orally daily OR 1000 mg orally once daily for at least 5-7 days. Pediatric azithromycin dose is 20 mg/kg orally once then 10-20 mg/kg orally once per day (maximum 1000 mg per day) for at least 5-7 days.
- Carbapenems should be used for patients with suspected severe or complicated typhoid fever who have traveled to Pakistan. Severe or complicated typhoid fever would include, but not be limited to, patients with gastrointestinal complications (such as typhoid-related intestinal perforation, peritonitis, intestinal hemorrhage, hepatitis), neurologic complications (such as typhoid encephalopathy, including altered consciousness, delirium, confusion), or bacteremia with sepsis or shock. When culture and sensitivity results are available, adjust treatment accordingly. Consider getting an infectious diseases consultation for these patients.
- Be aware that relapses can occur, often 1-3 weeks after clinical improvement.
- Be aware that most (90 percent) _Salmonella_ Typhi isolates from patients coming from South Asia have decreased susceptibility or resistance to fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin; therefore, fluoroquinolones should not be used as empiric treatment for suspected typhoid fever in patients who have traveled to this area.
- Report all cases of confirmed typhoid fever to the appropriate local or state health departments.
