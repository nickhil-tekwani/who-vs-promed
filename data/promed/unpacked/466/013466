Since the beginning of this year [2008] the State Public Health
Department recorded 37 147 suspected cases of dengue in all
municipalities of Rio Grande do Norte. In 1161 [3 percent] of these
cases, DHF [dengue hemorrhagic fever] was suspected, with 206
confirmations up to the present time. The deaths of 63 persons who
showed DHF symptoms were also reported [5 percent case fatality rate],
and laboratory tests confirmed [DHF as] the cause of [of death in] 7
of these cases.

Just in Grande Natal there were 18 453 [dengue cases] reported, of
which 753 were DHF [4 percent]. Also, there are 22 deaths in the
region suspected to have been due to the disease [3 percent case
fatality rate], with [laboratory] confirmation of 2 cases.

There were 9978 dengue fever and 1159 DHF cases [12 percent]
concentrated in the state capital [Natal].

In the west and Vale do Acu, dengue attacked 3429 people, with 50

The Epidemiology Department of the municipal Secretariat of Health
presented yesterday [22 Jul 2008] a new total of confirmed cases of
dengue infections in Campos. The new statistics shows that since the
beginning of the year [2008], 13 283 people were infected by one of
the 3 serotypes of the disease [virus], and of this total, 6984 [half
-- were infected] just in the month of April. Next 1 Aug [2008], the
Center for Control of Zoonoses (CCZ) will report the total number of
mosquitoes that will be collected through the IM -- intelligent
[dengue] monitoring -- information system [using] traps to capture
_Aedes aegypti_.

According to municipal authorities, data released by the department
of Epidemiology showed that despite the reduction in the overall
picture of the epidemic in the municipality, which resulted in the
death of 6 persons, the mosquito vector of the disease [virus]
continues to proliferate in various parts of the city. Because of the
[epidemic] risk, the routine work of tackling foci of vector mosquito
breeding sites, which must be developed daily by the population, is
still identified as the only weapon capable of preventing a new
outbreak of the disease.

Investigations conducted of patients who had symptoms suspected to be
dengue, [who were] attended by the Dengue Referral Center in the last
6 months, continue to be reevaluated by the Epidemiology team that
redraws the graph of infections confirmed in Campos every month. The
new totals show that 11 infected people in the municipality presented
symptoms of dengue complications. In another 5 patients, the disease
evolved to DHF.

Epidemiological analysis highlighted that adults 20-49 years old
accounted for 52.5 percent of the 13 283 patients infected by dengue
in the city this year [2008]. Children and adolescents from 10-19
years represented 18.8 percent of the total [number] of people infected.
According to the head of the Department of Epidemiology, Elizabeth
Tudesco, despite the reduction in the number of cases of infection in
the current period, there is still the possibility of a new explosive
epidemic of the disease.

[The differences in DHF rates in section [1] above are not
significant. Nationwide, for epidemiological week 22, Brazil reported
to PAHO 473 000 cases of dengue including 10 000 cases of DHF (rounded
figures, not all lab confirmed), giving a national DHF rate of 2
percent:
