Bluetongue in Cyprus
----------------------
Emergency report
Information received on 12 Mar 2004 from Dr Phedias Loucaides, Director of
Veterinary Services, Ministry of Agriculture, Nicosia:
Date of the report: 12 Mar 2004.
Nature of diagnosis: clinical suspicion followed by laboratory confirmation.
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 25 Nov 2003.
Estimated date of primary infection: 20 Sep 2003.
Background:
Seropositive animals have always been found in Cyprus. Since September
2003, a surveillance programme has been in place, with sentinel animals in
several regions of Cyprus.
Seroconversion of the sentinel animals was found in the samples collected
in October 2003. Based on these results, clinical surveillance was intensified.
Outbreaks:
Location: Famagusta (Ammochostos) district, in the eastern part of the country
No. of outbreaks 6 flocks*
* The location of each flock concerned is shown by a star on the map
[available at the website above].
Description of affected population: all of the affected animals were
females except one ram. The affected sheep belong to the Chios breed or
Chios cross breed. The affected goat belongs to the Damascus breed.
Total number of animals in the outbreak:
species / susceptible / cases / deaths / destroyed / slaughtered
ovi / 1299 / 71 / 0 / 0 / 0
cap / 69 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0
Diagnosis:
At the end of November 2003, very mild clinical signs were observed in 6
flocks in Ammochostos. Serum and blood samples were collected from these
flocks for laboratory examination. An unusually high percentage of
seropositive animals was found. Samples were sent to Greece for virus
isolation. On 10 Mar 2004, the Veterinary Services of Cyprus received the
virus isolation results.
A. Laboratory where diagnosis was made: Department of Virology, Centre of
Athens Veterinary Institutions, Greece.
B. Diagnostic tests used: direct immunofluorescence test; serum
neutralisation test; virus isolation test.
C. Causal agent: bluetongue virus serotype 16.
Epidemiology:
A. Source of agent / origin of infection: unknown.
B. Mode of spread: arthropods (_Culicoides_).
Control measures:
- quarantine of the affected farms;
- control of arthropods.
Monitoring of sentinel animals is still going on according to the plan.
Vaccination is prohibited.

[This is a different serotype from the Mediterranean reports during the
fall of 2003 -- serotype 4 in Corsica and Sardinia or serotype 2 in
Tunisia. Peter Roeder's 2001 comments on the upsurge in the Mediterranean
are worth a look; see Bluetongue, upsurge - Mediterranean basin
20011122.2864. Excellent insight into the distribution by serotype and
circulation patterns in the Mediterranean, including a map, are also
provided by Prof. Manlio Fadda in Bluetongue, sheep - Italy (Sardinia) (04)
20030925.2426. - Mod.PC]
[Bluetongue virus serotype 16 was recorded in Israel on 11 Sept 2003;
see <http://oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_70.HTM#Sec4> and commentary in
Bluetongue, sheep - Israel, Correction 2003112.2798.
The timing of the disease (virus) introduction in both countries seems to
have been almost identical (the current report from Cyprus relates to 20
Sep 2003). This is not surprising, since it has been postulated that a
seasonal, annual introduction of BT-infected culicoides prevails in the
Eastern Mediterranean, the vectors carried by the Persian trough
(counter-clockwise) airstream during the second half of each year. This
introduction usually affects Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Jordan, and (mainly
southern) Turkey, while Cyprus is affected only sporadically -- once every
several years. (see ref 1).
Such a wind-borne introduction of BT virus occurred in 1977 at the same
location as the recent one, namely southeast Famagusta district (see ref 2).
It should not be surprising if seropositives against the BT serotype 16
were now found among sentinels in the other mentioned countries.

their BT surveillance programme. - Mod.AS]
