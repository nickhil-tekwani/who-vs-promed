-------------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract
--------
Background
COVID-19 frequently necessitates inpatient treatment and inpatient mortality is high. Less is known about the long-term outcomes in terms of mortality and readmissions following inpatient treatment.

Aim
The aim of this paper is to provide a detailed account of hospitalized COVID-19 patients up to 180 days after their initial hospital admission.

Methods
An observational study with claims data from the German Local Health Care Funds of adult patients hospitalized in Germany between 1 Feb and 30 Apr 2020, with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and a related principal diagnosis, for whom 6-month all-cause mortality and readmission rates for 180 days after admission or until death were available. A multivariable logistic regression model identified independent risk factors for 180-day all-cause mortality in this cohort.

Results
Of the 8679 patients with a median age of 72 years, 2161 (24.9%) died during the index hospitalization. The 30-day all-cause mortality rate was 23.9% (2073/8679), the 90-day rate was 27.9% (2425/8679), and the 180-day rate, 29.6% (2566/8679). The latter was 52.3% (1472/2817) for patients aged ≥80 years, 23.6% (1621/6865) if not ventilated during index hospitalization, but 53.0% in case of those ventilated invasively (853/1608). Risk factors for the 180-day all-cause mortality included coagulopathy, BMI ≥ 40, and age, while the female sex was a protective factor beyond a fewer prevalence of comorbidities. Of the 6235 patients discharged alive, 1668 were readmitted a total of 2551 times within 180 days, resulting in an overall readmission rate of 26.8%.

Conclusions
The 180-day follow-up data of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in a nationwide cohort representing almost one-third of the German population show significant long-term, all-cause mortality and readmission rates, especially among patients with coagulopathy, whereas women have a profoundly better and long-lasting clinical outcome than men.

Strengths and limitations
The major strength of our study is its size and length of follow-up, our cohort being the largest cohort of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 that was followed up for six months after admission and discharge, respectively.

General limitations include that, given its observational nature, this study cannot determine causality between risk factors and long-term mortality, nor does it provide information on the patients' cause of death. Lastly, the inclusion of patients admitted for COVID-19-related principal diagnoses might not be sufficient to distinguish between patients who were hospitalized for COVID-19 and patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized for other reasons.

[2] Mixing vaccines

https://www.10news.com/news/in-depth/in-depth-mixing-vaccines-could-help-boost-immunity-against-covid-19


Research from across Europe shows that mixing COVID-19 vaccines may provide stronger immunity than getting a 2-dose regiment of a single vaccine. "It is an interesting and promising idea," says Dr Alessandro Sette from the La Jolla Institute for Immunology. Dr Sette says mixing shots could be the best way to help countries facing a vaccine shortage.

This week, the World Health Organization (WHO) placed a hold on booster shots. Officials say the world needs to make sure there are enough doses for everyone to get their 1st or 2nd shot before considering a 3rd. It underscores the idea that many poorer countries do not have enough vaccines.

Being able to mix different types of vaccines could be a way to help stretch the supply. Now, studies also show it could also provide stronger immunity. "The rationale is that the different vaccine platforms may stimulate the immune system in slightly different fashions," says Dr Sette. He calls it the "prime boost strategy", and it's based on the fact that different vaccines work in different ways. "Viral vector" vaccines, like the ones produced by Johnson and Johnson or AstraZeneca, introduce a harmless portion of the virus into our bodies. The immune system fights it off and develops antibodies to protect against future infection. Meanwhile, mRNA vaccines like Moderna and Pfizer teach the cells to make a spike protein similar to the coronavirus. They then get rid of that spike protein. The body remembers the instructions to recognize and fight the virus later. "By mixing and matching 2 different vaccines, you get a more complete activation of the immune system," says Dr Sette, noting that mixing the 2 types can give the immune system the best of both worlds.

New research from across Europe supports the "prime boost strategy" idea. In May [2021], researchers in Madrid presented the results of their "Combivax" study. They found that patients who got 1 dose of AstraZeneca and then 1 dose of Pfizer had a 150-fold increase in antibody titers compared with those who just got one AstraZeneca shot (https://www.isciii.es/Noticias/Noticias/Paginas/Noticias/Presentaci%C3%B3n-resultados-preliminares-CombivacS.aspx).

The "Com-Cov" study at the University of Oxford compared 4 vaccine combinations: 2 AstraZeneca shots, 2 Pfizer shots, 1 of each shot with AstraZeneca 1st, and 1 of each shot with Pfizer 1st (https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2021-06-28-mixed-oxfordpfizer-vaccine-schedules-generate-robust-immune-response-against-covid). The study found 2 Pfizer doses gave the highest level of antibodies. But it also discovered that both mixed vaccine combinations gave a better immune response than AstraZeneca alone. And they found people who got the AstraZeneca shot 1st produced higher antibodies and T-Cells than people who got the Pfizer vaccine as their 1st shot.

A 3rd study from Berlin followed 340 healthcare workers from December [2020] through May [2021], giving them one dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine and one dose of Pfizer (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.19.21257334v2.full.pdf). In that mix, when given 12 weeks apart, the mixed vaccines produced "higher immune responses" than traditional 2-dose vaccines given 3 weeks apart.

In all 3 studies, side effects in people who got mixed vaccines were similar to those of people who got the same vaccine. "The sum of the two is synergistic," says Dr Sette. "You get more than each of the 2 separately when added together."

Dr Sette told ABC 10News studies like this can be done relatively quickly because data from a few weeks or months can give hints about long-term results. He also says that because other studies already show the vaccines are safe on their own, we can assume they'll be safe together.

Still, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend mixing vaccines, as the United States has enough supply to ensure everyone gets a total dose of the same vaccine. No studies have been published about mixing the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, which is the only "viral vector" vaccine approved for use in the US. But Dr Sette says the European studies are essential for the safety of the world. "Ultimately, nobody is safe until the whole world has gotten over the pandemic," he says.

[3] Infection in children
Date: Wed 4 Aug 2021

The number of children contracting COVID-19 has increased 5-fold since the end of June [2021], with a "substantial" 84% jump in the last week alone, according to a new report from the American Academy of Pediatrics, which comes as numerous states report upticks in child hospitalizations amid the ongoing delta surge.

The pediatricians' group said on Tue [3 Aug 2021] that it had recorded almost 72 000 new cases of COVID-19 among children from 22-29 July, up from 39 000 the week prior and a sum that accounted for 19% of all cases reported nationally over that period.

As cases among children continue on an upward trend that dates back to early July [2021], a growing number of states are sounding the alarm about the number of children being hospitalized, with many citing a corresponding spike in cases of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a contagious seasonal [respiratory infection] that is commoner in the wintertime. Child hospitalizations have risen in at least 8 states, either state-wide or in major pediatric facilities, according to a mix of state and federal data, and local reports.

Florida currently leads the nation in kids hospitalized for COVID-19, with 32 pediatric hospitalizations per day between 24 and 30 July [2021] (a rate of 0.76 children hospitalized per 100 000 residents), CDC data shared with The Tampa Bay-Times shows. However, officials from major childrens' hospitals in Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Missouri, South Carolina and Texas say their facilities are quickly filling with sick children too, either from COVID-19 too or the mix of the 2 surging respiratory infections.

Alabama, which reported a new record of 34 children hospitalized amid the COVID-19 pandemic last week, now has 38 children hospitalized, according to the Associated Press. Major children's hospitals in Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana and Florida--states that have been battling a broader increase in hospitalizations--all said last week they had more children in their care than at any other point in the pandemic.

As no regularly updated, comprehensive data on child COVID-19 cases are available, it's unclear whether the rise in hospitalizations is occurring nationwide. The last report from CDC, in early June [2021], found hospitalization rates among children peaked at 2.1 per 100 000 in January [2021]. Meanwhile, the American Academy of Pediatrics (which acknowledges it is missing data from some states) reports the number of hospitalizations has remained steady throughout the pandemic, with children accounting for between 1.3% and 3.5% of hospitalizations, depending on the state. Overall, the risk of death and hospitalization among children who contract COVID-19 remains low. Just over 520 children have died from COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic (0.08% of the US's 612 000 total deaths) and only around 0.01% of recorded cases result in death. However, CDC notes that it is still possible for children to suffer from severe disease as it "occurs in all age groups".

Experts have floated numerous explanations for why child hospitalizations appear to be on the rise, with many pointing to the trend of younger people making up a larger proportion of new cases. Children under 12 are also unable to get the vaccine. Meanwhile, inoculations are severely lagging among teenagers and young adults for whom the shot is available.

Whether the combination of surging COVID-19 and RSV cases may overwhelm hospital pediatric units needs to be watched out for. After steadily increasing since early June [2021], cases of RSV saw a larger spike over the past month according to CDC data, prompting concern from some public health experts.

Dr Heather Haq, a pediatrician at Texas Children's Hospital in Houston, recently detailed in a series of Twitter posts how "the surge upon surge" is impacting her facility. "After many months of zero or few pediatric COVID-19 cases, we are seeing infants, children and teens with COVID-19 pouring back into the hospital, more and more each day," Haq wrote, explaining the hospital also has "winter-level patient volumes of acutely ill infants/toddlers with RSV". "I worry that we will run out of beds and staff," she said.

[Fortunately, deaths in children infected with SARS-CoV-2 are rare. But with the combined increase of children infected with SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, the hospitals will definitely be challenged.

Children have also been reported to be experiencing increased incidence of respiratory syncytial virus, which is historically more often seen in winter. "Cases of RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) have risen gradually since early June [2021], with an even greater spike in the past month, according to data from CDC. The illness, which can cause symptoms that include a runny nose, coughing, sneezing and fever, normally begins to spread in the fall, making this summer spike unusual....Experts there say that children may be more vulnerable than usual to seasonal viruses and infections because they were underexposed to germs during lockdowns early in the pandemic." (from https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/01/world/delta-variant-kids-infections.html)

"Respiratory syncytial virus has become recognized as a leading global cause of morbidity and mortality, especially amongst infants in the first 6 months of life. [It] is the commonest cause of childhood acute respiratory infection (ARI) and the major single cause of hospitalization during infancy. In recent decades, it has been realized that it also afflicts various at-risk adults, including frail elderly and immunocompromised persons."

The South Asian COVID-19 situation, according to data from Worldometer (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) as of 6 Aug 2021 at 03:41 GMT:

Country: Total cases / Total deaths / Deaths per million population
India: 31 856 757 / 426 785 / 306
Bangladesh: 1 322 654 / 21 902/ 132
Pakistan: 1 058 405 / 23 702 / 105
Nepal: 708 079 / 9994 / 336
Sri Lanka: 321 429 / 4821 / 224
Afghanistan: 149 806 / 6879 / 172
Maldives: 77 999 / 222 / 403
Bhutan: 2543 / 2 / 3

Over the last 7 days, 284 413, 96 401, 33 544, 17 437, 17 227, and 3283 COVID-19 cases were detected in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Afghanistan, respectively. This compares with 279 282, 86 053, 24 827, 15 916, 12 904, and 3084 cases in the preceding 7 days, revealing a slow and steady increasing trend still in India and Nepal, the continuation of a sustainable uptrend in Bangladesh, almost a stable trend in Afghanistan, but the development of sharp peaks of new cases in Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

The spread of the delta variant in Pakistan has already been reported.The variant has also been detected in Sri Lanka. A report published in mass media indicates that 75% of the COVID-19 cases detected in Colombo during the last week of July 2021 were caused by this variant. (https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking_news/75-of-Delta-variant-cases-detected-in-last-week-of-July-from-Colombo/108-217615).

It would not be surprising to see a rapid escalation of the disease situation in these 2 countries because of the massive spread of the highly infectious delta variant, as was seen previously in India and Nepal, and is being currently observed in Bangladesh.

The current proportional case positivity is much higher in Bangladesh than in other South Asian countries. Although the daily case positivity dropped a bit from around 30% recorded over the previous 2 weeks, the total numbers of new cases and deaths both increased in the last 7 days. A total of 264 deaths were reported officially from the country yesterday, the highest single day count since the 1st death reported from the disease in the country on 18 Mar 2020. The disease has perhaps reached its highest peak in this current wave and should recede a bit in the near future thanks to the country-wide lockdown imposed which has been extended to 10 Aug 2021. The results of sequence data of 300 samples from a study in the country revealed the presence of the delta variant in 98% of the samples investigated (https://www.thedailystar.net/health/disease/coronavirus/news/delta-variant-found-98pc-covid-samples-2145851).

Still, there is no clear sign that the slow and steady growth of new cases in India and Nepal, as seen over the last 2 weeks or so, will turn into a significant new wave in the near future. However, this possibility cannot be ruled out, and therefore, both countries should take preemptive measures to avoid it. The total number of deaths in Nepal attributed to the disease is close to the milestone of 10 000.

To compare the situation in South Asian countries above with previous disease data, readers are referred to ProMED-SoAs archives.

The lowest number of confirmed cases recorded so far is from Bhutan (2543), with 2 deaths. - Mod.PKB]
