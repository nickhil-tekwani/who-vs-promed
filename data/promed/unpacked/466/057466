[Since Koi herpesvirus disease (KHD) in common carp (_Cyprinus carpio_) was detected in Israel and Germany 1998 (note that the previous post -- 20120513.1131835 -- wrongly states 1988 and omits Germany), the disease has been reported throughout the world. Other outbreaks in Sweden occurred in August 2009 and September 2011.

More information on KHD is found in OIE Aquatic Manual chapter (2009 update), which is available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/aahm/2010/2.3.06_KHVD.pdf.
