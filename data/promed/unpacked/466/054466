Industry expert says buyers better get used to skyrocketing shrimp prices. The shrimp shortage resulting from the spread of early mortality syndrome (EMS) across Asia is set to last at least a couple of years, "maybe longer" according to Matthew Biggs, an aquaculture consultant for Ridley Aquafeed with more than a decade of experience in the southeast Asian shrimp industry.

And shifting to shrimp imports from EMS-free countries may not prove a long-term solution for the world market, experts warned in a Bangkok Post article.

To date, the disease has yet to be reported in Bangladesh, Ecuador, India, and Indonesia, but last week [9-15 Sep 2013] it was confirmed to be in Mexico.

"It's almost inevitably going to get to these other countries," said Briggs. "And if it does get in the other countries, which is pretty likely that it will, then there is going to be a really, really severe shortfall."

EMS first raised its head on Chinese farms in 2009, and gradually spread to Malaysia, Viet Nam, and Thailand. The 4 countries accounted for about 70 percent of the world's shrimp exports in 2011, according to figures from the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). Thailand, the world's leading shrimp exporter, started to get hit by EMS in late 2012.

"My farm was affected in August last year [2012], when we lost about 80 percent of our stock," said Prayoon Hongrat, president of Sureerath Farm in Chantaburi province, in eastern Thailand.

"We need to bring our water supply from outside and we think that is what spread the disease in our nursery," said Prayoon, whose farm specializes in organic shrimp raised in environmentally friendly conditions.

Scientists still don't know much about EMS. Over the past 2 or 3 decades, commercial shrimp farms have been hit by 20 viral and bacterial epidemics and new syndromes.

"This is different," said Simon Funga-Smith, Senior Fisheries Officer at the Bangkok FAO headquarters. "Most of the past diseases have been caused by a virus infecting the animal, but EMS is caused by a virus that is infecting a bacterium in the shrimp, which is then creating a toxin which is poisoning the animal."

"At the moment we've only literally just been able to sort of replicate the disease in the laboratory, which is the 1st step you need to take," he said.

Shrimp farms are highly prone to the rapid spread of new viruses because they are mono-cultures.

Since 2001, Asian farms have shifted from raising _Penaeus monodon_ (black tiger), indigenous to Asia, to [_Litopenaeus vannamei_, formerly _Penaeus vannamei_], a Latin American prawn, chiefly because it has been less susceptible to diseases, until EMS hit.

The switch has accounted for Asian dominance in shrimp exports for the past decade. It has also led to overstocking of ponds and, inevitably, degraded pond environments and weaker shrimp stock.

Thailand shrimp production amounted to 485 000 metric tons last year [2012], of which 80 percent was exported. The association expects only 270 000 metric tons in 2013, partly because of EMS, but also because farmers are too afraid of EMS to restock their ponds, Poj said.

"In the future, each country, including Thailand, needs to figure out what is the right amount we should farm to reach a sustainable production," he said.

China's total output of shrimps was more than 1.5 million metric tons annually before EMS, of which about 200 000 metric tons was exported, said Cui He, vice-president of the China Aquatic Products Processing and Marketing Alliance.

Since the EMS epidemic, China has been importing shrimp from India and Ecuador just to satisfy the huge domestic demand. "We used to be an exporting country, but now we are an importing country," Cui said.

Viet Nam has also been importing shrimp to keep its processing industry going.

Despite a decline in volume, Viet Nam earned nearly [USD] 1.4 billion from shrimp exports in the 1st 7 months of this year, up 14.7 percent year-on-year, thanks to increased prices on the international market, the Vietnam Association of Seafood Exporters and Producers said.

But some of that was sourced from imported shrimp, which cost the country USD 170 million (Euro 127.5 million) last year [2012], it confirmed.

Malaysia, which produces about 80 000 metric tons of shrimp a year, has not been spared the EMS plague.

"Our main concern is how to overcome diseases, particularly early mortality syndrome," said Syed Omar Jaafar, president of the Malaysian Shrimp Association.

[Early mortality syndrome (EMS), more technically known as acute hepatopancreatic necrosis syndrome (AHPNS), is a new disease that appeared in shrimp farms located in southern China and Hainan Island in 2010. By early 2011, it was also detected in Viet Nam and Malaysia.

The disease appears within 20 to 30 days of stocking ponds with postlarvae. Both black tiger shrimp, _Penaeus monodon_ (see picture at http://www.shiau.ntou.edu.tw/shiau.jpg), and Pacific white shrimp, _Litopenaeus vannamei_ (see picture at
http://www.vannamei101.com/vannamei_photo/33g%20Penaeus%20vannamei%20rearing%20in%20Thailand.jpg), are affected by the disease

Mortalities can approach 100 percent in severely affected ponds, where diseased shrimp become lethargic and anorexic. Upon simple dissection, the hepatopancreas organs of the shrimp may appear atrophied and whitish with black streaks. Other signs include a soft, generally darker shell and mottling of the carapace.

In early 2013, the Aquaculture Pathology Laboratory at the University of Arizona was able to isolate the causative agent of AHPNS in pure culture. AHPNS has a bacterial etiology, which has been identified as a member of the _Vibrio harveyi_ clade, most closely related to _V. parahaemolyticus_. This bacterium is infected by a virus, known as a phage, which causes it to release a potent toxin.
