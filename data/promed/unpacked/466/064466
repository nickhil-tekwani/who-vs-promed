Children are vulnerable to a relatively new viral infection called hand-foot-mouth disease [HFMD], warn doctors. Doctors say the number of cases has almost doubled compared to last year [2013]. "I've been seeing dozens of children in the last few weeks," said Dr Vijay Yewale, president of Indian Academy of Pediatrics.

The infection, considered highly contagious, is relatively unharmful. "The problem is that parents forget to keep the child hydrated," said Dr Deepak Ugra from Lilavati Hospital in Bandra [suburb in West Mumbai, Maharashtra state]. Pediatrician Dr Prashant Moralwar said this is the season for the disease, caused by a virus, and infected children must be kept away from school and human interaction.

[Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common infectious disease of infants and children. The symptoms commonly observed include fever, painful sores in the mouth, and a rash with blisters on hands, feet and also buttocks. HFMD is most commonly caused by coxsackievirus A16, which usually results in a mild, self-limiting disease with a few complications. HFMD is also caused by enteroviruses, including enterovirus 71 (EV71), which in large outbreaks in southeastern Asia has been associated with serious complications in certain groups and may cause deaths. The virus and the absolute number of cases are not elucidated here.

HFMD mainly occurs amongst children under 10 years old. The usual period from infection to onset of symptoms is 3-7 days. The disease usually begins with fever, poor appetite, malaise, and frequently with a sore throat. One or 2 days after fever onset, painful sores develop in the mouth. They begin as small red spots that blister and then often become ulcers. They are usually located on the tongue, gums and inside of the cheeks. A non-itchy skin rash develops over 1-2 days with flat or raised red spots, some with blisters. The rash is usually located on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet and may also appear on the buttocks and/or genitalia. A person with HFMD may not have symptoms or may have only the rash or only mouth ulcers. In a small number of cases, children may experience a brief febrile illness, present with mixed neurological and respiratory symptoms and succumb rapidly from the disease.

HFMD virus is contagious, and infection is spread from person to person by direct contact with nose or throat discharges, saliva, fluid from blisters, or the stool of infected persons. Infected persons are most contagious during the 1st week of the illness, but the period of communicability can last for several weeks. HFMD is not transmitted from pets or other animals. HFMD should not be confused with the different disease in animals called foot-and-mouth disease.

Presently, there is no specific treatment available for HFMD. Patients should drink plenty of water or other liquids and may require treatment of the symptoms. Health care providers are advised to treat patients according to their symptoms and to refrain from using steroids. - Mod.LL
