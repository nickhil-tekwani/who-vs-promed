The New York City Health Department is investigating a community cluster of Legionnaires' disease in Lower Washington Heights. In the past 7 days, 8 people have been diagnosed with Legionnaires' disease. The cases are all from the same 20-block area. All but one person has been hospitalized, and one person has been discharged. Ages of the individuals range from younger than 40 to older than 80 [years], but most affected people were 50 years of age and older. There have been no deaths associated with this cluster.

Adults with flu-like symptoms, cough, fever or difficulty breathing should contact a physician immediately. "While most people exposed to _Legionella_ don't get sick, individuals ages 50 and above, especially those who smoke and have chronic lung conditions, are at a higher risk," said Health Commissioner Dr. Mary T. Bassett. "This disease is very treatable with antibiotics. I encourage anyone with symptoms of Legionnaires' disease to seek care early." The Health Department will hold a community meeting at Saint Luke's AME, 1872 Amsterdam Avenue, on Thursday [12 Jul 2018] evening at 7:00 PM.

[People usually acquire _Legionella_, the cause of Legionnaires' disease, after inhalation of aerosolized _Legionella_, frequently from a building's cooling tower. The contaminated aerosols can be wafted on air currents downwind from buildings with cooling towers in the vicinity, not necessarily from the building in which the patients reside. In fact, "Broad Street pneumonia" was described in passersby who were walking on Broad Street in front of the Philadelphia hotel where the 1976 Legionnaires' disease outbreak occurred, but who had never entered the hotel (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00045731.htm).

_Legionella_ can also be acquired by inhalation of contaminated aerosols generated within the home, e.g., by showerheads, or aspiration of contaminated potable water in people prone to aspirate, such as very debilitated people. Possible person-to-person transmission has also been described (Correia AM, Gon√ßalves J, Gomes JP, et al: Probable person-to-person transmission of legionnaires' disease. N Engl J Med 2016;374(5):497-498 http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356).

Genotyping the strains isolated from the 8 patients will help establish a common source outbreak, if the genotypes match. However, if the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no isolates for genotyping.

Washington Heights is a mainly residential neighborhood in the northern portion of the New York City borough of Manhattan, in the US state of New York; Washington Heights extends from West 115th Street to the south and the neighborhood of Inwood to the north (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Heights,_Manhattan).
