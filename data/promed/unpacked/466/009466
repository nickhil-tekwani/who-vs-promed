A suspected case of avian influenza was found in the village of
Sigbehoue in an eastern province of Togo, which recently experienced
a massive death of poultry, Togo's national radio station reported on
Friday [15 Jun 2007] evening.
The report said a blood sample has been sent to a laboratory for
further tests. Togolese authorities called on the public to stay
calm, remain cautious, and take measures to quarantine poultry and
birds.
On 24 Apr 2007, a case of the H5N1 virus was detected at a poultry
farm near Tema, the port city east of the Ghanaian capital, Accra
[for original data, see further in the commentary]. Togolese
authorities have taken a series of measures to prevent and fight
against bird flu in early May 2007.
The Ministries of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Fisheries
released a memorandum on Friday [15 Jun 2007] to reiterate its ban on
all imports of poultry and poultry products from countries where the
virus has been identified.
The memorandum said that "in a bid to guard against the scourge, the
imports of poultry -- live, frozen and day-old chicks -- from Ghana
have been banned until further notice."
The memorandum asked civilians who find sudden and massive deaths of
poultry and wild birds to report them to veterinary departments.
