A huge mass of marine mucilage -- a thick, slimy substance made up of compounds released by marine organisms -- has bloomed in Turkey's Marmara, as well as in the adjoining Black and Aegean Seas.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said untreated waste dumped into the Marmara Sea and climate change caused the sea slime bloom.

Istanbul, Turkey's largest city with some 16 million residents, and 5 other provinces, factories, and industrial hubs border the sea.

Marine mucilage has reached unprecedented levels this year [2021] in Turkey. It is visible above the water as a slimy grey sheet along the shores of Istanbul and neighbouring provinces. Underwater videos showed suffocated coral covered with it.

Marine experts say human waste and industrial pollution is choking Turkey's seas. They say the rise in water temperatures from climate change is contributing to the problem.

A thick, brown, bubbly foam dubbed "sea snot" has covered the shores of the Sea of Marmara, alarming Istanbul residents and threatening marine life. The naturally occurring mucilage was 1st documented in Turkey in 2007 when it was also seen in parts of the Aegean Sea near Greece.

This outbreak is the largest on record, blamed by experts on a combination of pollution and global warming, which speeds up the growth of algae responsible for the slimy sludge.

Istanbul University biology professor Muharrem Balci said when the algae grow out of control in springtime, as they have done this year [2020], they block out the sun and cause oxygen depletion for fish and marine life. The "sea snot" results from a sort of nutrient overload for the algae, which feast on warm weather and water pollution, having grown progressively worse in the past 40 years, Balci said.

The Marmara Sea, which stretches along Istanbul's southern coast from the Bosphorus to the Aegean Sea, is densely populated and home to numerous industrial sites.

Turkey's president promised to rescue the Marmara Sea from the outbreak that is alarming marine biologists and environmentalists.

["Sea snot" is more scientifically known as "marine mucilage," and it is an ecosystem of its own. In a 2009 paper in the journal PLOS One, a team of scientists led by Roberto Danovaro, a marine biologist at Italy's Polytechnic University of Marche, described it as a "gelatinous" stage of marine snow, the jumble of organic material -- such as feces and fragments of dead plants and animals -- that drifts from the surface to the ocean floor.

The sludge is produced by a large number microorganisms, one Turkish research team explained in a UNESCO bulletin called Harmful Algae News, especially microalgae known as diatoms. These petite algae are known to exude polysaccharides, sugary carbohydrates that can get quite sticky. Sampling marine mucilage that clotted several locations in the Sea of Marmara in 2007 and 2008, the researchers also identified species of dinoflagellates and more.

Like the mucus launched from human nostrils, sea snot can smell foul, and slimes whatever it touches. And, in addition to discouraging swimmers and deterring fishing, the gunk can be a nuisance for corals, scientists have found.

From December 2020 to early March 2021, H. Barzalp, a marine biologist at Turkey's Aanakkale Onsekiz Mart University, measured the effects of sea snot on reefs in the Aanakkale Strait. Barzalp found that some of the creatures were dripping with the stuff. It looked as though they had been blasted with ectoplasm, or wrapped in a spider's web, and the substance seemed to be killing some of the branches. A thick coating can deprive the corals of oxygen, and other research teams have worked to determine the mucilage's effect on mussels, crabs, and other sediment-dwellers. Danovaro's team found that the sticky matrix can also entrap viruses and potentially ferry them around marine ecosystems.

Sea snot has coated portions of the Mediterranean several times in recent years. In March 2007, Danovaro's team reported, it fouled more than 1550 miles of Italy's coastline, and clusters stuck around for 5 months. Researchers suspect it's urged on by several factors, though the precise mechanisms of what causes a snot bloom are somewhat mysterious. "We actually know very little about the interactions between chemistry, biology, and physics that lead to these extreme events," writes Uta Passow, an oceanographer at Canada's Memorial University who studies marine snow, in an email.

These substances are always in the water, Passow adds, but when they go from discrete and microscopic to massive clumps easily visible to the naked eye, something is out of whack. Passow says that warming and an influx of nutrients could both nudge a system off balance if the "right" organisms thrive and weather conditions don't break up and dilute the aquatic boogers. Danovaro's team found that some nasty cases -- the snot that sprawled the most and hung on the longest -- coincided with higher-than-average water temperatures. "In light of the warming trend of the Mediterranean Sea, the mucilage phenomenon could increase in the future," the team wrote.

As for the sea snot currently choking the Sea of Marmara: Reuters reported that Turkish environment minister Murat Kurum and other officials are examining whether pollution and sewage are contributing, and they will hatch a plan in June 2021. Extreme snot events are "a call for help from the system," Passow says. And while marine creatures and nearby landlubbers wait for a hand, "the water could use a tissue, a really, really absorbent one."

The Turkish coast is having a particularly nasty case of this sea snot. The website of the article has some photos of the water and how slimy this growth seems to be. It is easy to see how it could block oxygen and kill coral. Apparently, the marine mucilage or sea snot is deeper than just the surface of the water. - Mod.TG
