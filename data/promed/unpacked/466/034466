Indore poliomyelitis in China alarms health officials
-----------------------------------------------------
NEW DELHI: During the course of the extensive anti-polio campaign being
conducted in China, a strain of poliomyelitis virus, traced to India, has
compelled neighbouring China to relaunch its efforts at polio eradication.
The origin of the poliomyelitis virus in China was detected with the help
of gene-sequencing. It [origin was traced not just to India, but to a
precise locality i.e.: Indore in Madhya Pradesh.
China was certified polio-free in March 1997, but subsequently a case of
acute flaccid paralysis in was detected in a 16-month-old boy in Qinhai
Province. Following this, seven million children in Qinhai Province were
immunised. Additional vaccination days are planned in the coming months.
This case caused serious concern among health officials here and led to
some reassessment of procedures for control of virus transmissions from
bordering countries. The government is being persuaded now to conduct pulse
polio immunisation on the same day as done in neighbouring countries.
"There are lessons to be learnt from this event" said N.K. Arora of the All
India Institute of Medical Sciences, who is conducting a countrywide
surveillance of the pulse polio programme. "This shows that polio virus
circulating anywhere in the world poses a danger for every country. There
is no room for complacency even after a zero-polio situation. Carriers of
the virus (i.e., those who get infected but do not show any symptoms) can
infect susceptible groups in any country. This is especially true for
developing countries as immunisation programmes in such nations usually
fail to cover the entire population. For every case of polio, there are 500
people who become carriers for the disease. While polio cases in [India
have come down substantially since the pulse polio programme was launched
five years ago, the situation in some states continues to cause concern. UP
has already reported 38 polio cases this year. Bihar is close behind with 28.
Poliomyelitis virus is being transmitted because some pockets have not been
immunised, health officials say. The goal was to eradicate the disease by
this year. But poor immunisation in these pockets is hampering it. The
high-risk migratory population is affecting Delhi's performance as well."
[In the pulse polio programme, all children below the age of five are given
polio vaccine on the same day. The idea is to expel the virus everywhere
simultaneously. More than 100 countries have eradicated polio this way.

[This report was also referred to ProMED-mail by Dr. Jack Soo
<kyip@asia.com>. The text is ambiguous and it is not entirely clear that
the Indore genotype of poliomyelitis virus was in fact the strain isolated
from the patient in Qinhai. It is clear that cross-border cooperation will
be an increasing necessity in the final stages of the global eradication of
poliomyelitis - Mod. CP
