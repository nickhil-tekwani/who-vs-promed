Abstract
---------
Epizootic haemorrhagic disease (EHD) is a _Culicoides_-borne viral disease caused by epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) and associated with clinical manifestations in cervids and bovids. In late September 2021, EHDV was reported in cattle farms in central/western Tunisia. It rapidly spread throughout the country with more than 200 confirmed outbreaks. A combination of classical and molecular techniques was applied to characterize the causative virus as a member of EHDV-8 serotype. This is the 1st evidence of EHDV- 8 circulation since 1982 when the prototype EHDV-8 strain was isolated in Australia. This work highlights the urgent need for vaccines for a range of EHDV serotypes.

[Epizootic hemorrhagic disease [EHD] is a vector-borne infectious, noncontagious viral disease of domestic and wild ruminants, primarily white-tailed deer, other cervids, and cattle. Sheep, goats, and camelids might also be susceptible but usually do not develop overt disease. There are 8 or more serotypes. EHDV demonstrates immunological cross reactivity with the bluetongue virus group. The disease is not zoonotic.

EHDV has been isolated from wild and domestic ruminants and arthropods in North and Central America, Asia, Africa, and Australia and more recently in countries along the southern and eastern shores of the Mediterranean Basin including Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, Israel, Jordan, and Turkey.

Last year's [2021] EHD event was reported by Tunisia to the WOAH on 23 Oct 2021; serotyping was pending. The accomplishment of the serotyping, by the Institute of Veterinary Research in Tunisia (IRVT) in collaboration with the IZS in Teramo, Italy, and others, is presented in the above paper (yet to be peer reviewed). According to media-derived information, the disease has recurred in Tunisia since August 2022 (ProMED post 20220821.8705142).

Recently, EHD has been reported in Sardinia (ProMED post 20221110.8706660), becoming the 1st diagnosis of this orbivirus in Europe. Airborne transmission of infected _Culicoides_ vectors from North Africa has been suspected; the distance between Tunisia and Sardinia, as the crow flies, is about 250 km [155 mi].

As a vector-borne viral disease, the distribution of EHD is limited to the distribution of competent _Culicoides_ vectors. Outbreaks generally coincide with the peak of vector population abundance, so most cases of EHD occur in the late summer and autumn.

Serotyping of this year's [2022] EHD virus strains circulating in Tunisia and Sardinia is conditional for the establishment of the spread route. - Mod.AS
