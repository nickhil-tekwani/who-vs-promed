Blood Weekly, a publication of Thomson Corporation in the US, reported in
its current issue that Cameroon State television announced that an outbreak
of hemorrhagic fever in the Ngoela region of the eastern part of the
country has infected 230 since Dec 1997, killing 40.
Provincial Health Officer Dr. Levis Mpiouang,speaking by telephone to the
television station, confirmed the death toll. "I would like to stress that
this is not an outbreak of Ebola, but bloody diarrhea accompanied by light
fever."
