Turkish quake zone fish poison some 200 people
-----------------------------------------------
Some 200 people have suffered food poisoning after eating
anchovies fished from Turkey's Marmara Sea, a health official
said on Monday.
The Istanbul regional health director said none of around 200
people who sought medical treatment was seriously ill.
"We have recommended a ban on the sale of Marmara
anchovies,'' Mecit Caliskan said on NTV news channel.
He said natural fish toxins could have caused the illness. Results
of bacteriological testing were now being assessed.
The August earthquake killed some 16 800 people in towns around
the eastern end of the Marmara Sea. An oil refinery fire ignited by
the tremor led to an oil spill which covered a large area of sea [but
previous tests found no traces of chemicals or heavy metals.
