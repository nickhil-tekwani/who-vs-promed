'Katte roga' mars lemon, orange trees in Kalasa
-----------------------------------------------
Malnad [northern Karnataka] received heavy rain during the monsoon,
which has an adverse affect on the horticultural crops in the region,
for example the citrus fruits.

The lemon and orange trees have developed a disease known as 'katte
roga' which is said to be due to prolonged cold and moist weather. In
the past, this disease used to be seen [only] rarely. But this year
[2011] it has infested almost every plantation.

The fruits and leaves turn yellow, then they fall off. Plants are left
only with thin twigs and die soon. So far, farmers have not found any
solution for the problem. "Once the plant is affected by this disease
we have to write it off as dead," say most of the growers.

Lemon and orange trees are a good source of income for small farmers.
However, this year [2011] farmers who have lost their main crops are
seeing their hopes tumble with mixed crops also developing diseases.

[The term "katte roga" appears to be used in Karnataka for a number of
problems on different crops, including also banana bunchy top and a
disease that destroyed cardamom crops in the 1980s. Several
undiagnosed diseases of citrus have been reported recently from the
region (see links below), but conclusive diagnosis of the pathogen(s)
involved are needed to design effective management strategies.

A number of diseases and pathogens of citrus are known to occur in
India, including tristeza, greening (huanglongbing), canker,
nematodes, and a range of fungi, viruses, and viroids. Multifactorial
'dieback' complexes, which may also include additional environmental
factors, have also been reported. It is thought that combinations of
various pathogens may have contributed to the general decline of
citrus health in the region due to accumulation of parasitic pathogens
in old orchards over time. Extensive harvest failures have led to
citrus replanting programmes (ProMED-mail post no. 20080130.0375), but
these need to be linked to ongoing crop monitoring to prevent
reinfections.
