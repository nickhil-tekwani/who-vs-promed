Smallpox vaccine adverse events monitoring and response for the first stage
of the smallpox vaccination program
------------------------------------------
Smallpox vaccination of civilian volunteer health care workers began on 24
Jan 2003. As of 4 Feb 2003, a total of 37 states and counties have received
shipments of smallpox vaccine, and 18 states and counties have begun
smallpox vaccination; no serious adverse events have been reported. To
monitor the occurrence of adverse events associated with vaccination, both
those expected on the basis of previous experience and possible new
unexpected adverse events, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) and state health departments have established the Smallpox Vaccine
Adverse Events Monitoring and Response System. The system also will be used
to monitor the effectiveness of contraindication screening, identify new
contraindications, and coordinate the distribution of vaccinia immune
globulin (VIG) and cidofovir to the civilian population. This notice
describes the components of the system, delineates roles and
responsibilities, and explains how data from the system will be compiled
and communicated.
The first stage of the vaccination program targets 1) smallpox response
teams designated by terrorism and public health authorities to conduct
investigation and follow-up of initial smallpox cases and 2) health care
teams whose members are trained to provide medical care for initial
smallpox patients (1). During this stage, the Institute of Medicine (IOM)
has recommended active surveillance for adverse events following smallpox
vaccination (2). To implement this recommendation among all vaccinees and
their contacts, the system will track adverse events that require
hospitalization or outpatient care, contraindications to vaccination among
vaccinees or household contacts not identified at the time of vaccination,
and vaccinia transmission to contacts of vaccinees. CDC also will collect
data from people who experience commoner, nonserious adverse events in a
telephone survey of about 10 000 vaccinees from at least 8 states and
cities administered at days 10 and 21 following vaccination.
Successful monitoring of and response to adverse events following smallpox
vaccination depends on the efforts of vaccination clinic staff,
vaccination-site--care monitors at hospitals and other locations, health
care providers, state health departments, and CDC. At smallpox vaccination
clinics, a unique identifying number will be assigned to each vaccinee, and
each vaccinee's vaccination information will be entered into an electronic
tracking system (either the Pre-event Vaccination System (PVS) maintained
by CDC or the state equivalent). In the days following vaccination,
monitors at hospitals and other locations should assess vaccination-site
care, symptoms reported by the vaccinees, and vaccine take (that is,
response to vaccination). For hospital staff, monitors also should
determine fitness for duty. CDC's web-based Hospital Smallpox Vaccine
Monitoring System can be used to facilitate monitoring and to enter
tracking data. Vaccination-site--care monitors and health-care providers
should report adverse events associated with vaccination as they occur
[table below]. When vaccination follow-up is completed (usually 21--28 days
after vaccination), vaccination-site--care monitors should ensure that
information about adverse events that require hospitalization or outpatient
care, contraindications identified after vaccination, and contact
transmission are documented for all vaccinees. CDC will provide a data
entry mechanism linked to PVS for documenting this information.
Health care providers who need assistance with evaluating a smallpox
vaccinee with a potential adverse event should contact their state health
department or CDC's clinician information line, telephone 877-554-4625.
Staffed by nurses 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, this information line is a
source for general smallpox clinical adverse event information and for
assistance with adverse event reporting. As needed for clinical
consultation and release of VIG and cidofovir, callers to this line will be
connected to CDC's Smallpox Vaccine Adverse Events Clinical Consultation
Team, whose members are experts in infectious diseases, ophthalmology, and
neurology, and have back-up from smallpox/vaccinia disease experts. For
general information about diagnosis and management of smallpox
vaccination--associated adverse events, health care providers should
consult CDC's guidance for clinicians (3). Clinical evaluation tools to
assist health-care providers in the diagnosis and management of smallpox
vaccine adverse events also are available at
<http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/vaccination/clineval>.
Adverse events following smallpox vaccination should be reported to state
health departments and the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS),
the national surveillance system for adverse events following the
administration of US-licensed vaccines (4,5). Any adverse event that is of
concern to the clinician or patient should be reported. In addition,
certain events are recommended to be reported [table below]. Those adverse
events that require VIG or cidofovir should be reported immediately (3).
Other serious adverse events (those resulting in hospitalization, permanent
disability, life-threatening illness, or death) should be reported within
48 hours after recognition. Reports may be submitted to VAERS at
<http://secure.vaers.org/vaersdataentry.intro>.
CDC's secure web-based communications network for public health
investigation and response, the Epidemic Information Exchange (Epi-X)
(<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/epix/epix.html>), will be used for rapid and
regular exchange of smallpox vaccine adverse events data among state and
local health departments and CDC. These data will be tabulated regularly
and reported on CDC's smallpox website and in MMWR. The reported rates of
known serious adverse events will be compared with historically reported
rates. If higher-than-expected rates of known adverse events or unexpected
adverse events are detected from either active or passive surveillance
analysis, further investigation will be conducted. A workgroup of the
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices will assess the data
regularly. In addition, to ensure that the smallpox vaccination program is
conducted safely and effectively, IOM will provide ongoing programmatic
evaluation.
Table. Adverse events after smallpox vaccination that are recommended to be
reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System and to state health
departments*
Eczema vaccinatum
Erythema multiforme major or Stevens-Johnson syndrome
Fetal vaccinia
Generalized vaccinia
Inadvertent inoculation
Ocular vaccinia
Post-vaccinal encephalitis or encephalomyelitis
Progressive vaccinia
Pyogenic infection of vaccination site
Vaccinia transmission to contacts
Vaccination of persons with a contraindication to vaccination
Other serious adverse events (those resulting in hospitaliztion, permanent
disability, life-threatening illness or death)
---------------------------------------------
*Any adverse event that is of concern to the clinician or patient should be
reported.

[The above adverse event monitoring system seems a comprehensive response
to the charge of both the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
(ref. 1 above) and the Institute of Medicine's report (ref. 2 above). While
the Epi-X reporting system is a closed system, the intentions to publish
the data on the reported reactions are good. Checking out the CDC Smallpox
vaccination website (<http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/vaccination/>)
there is extensive background information but as yet a new webpage for
vaccine reactions as part of the current drive has not been included.
Remembering that the adverse reaction rates observed following the use of
this vaccine (studied in 1968)
(<http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/vaccine-safety/adverse-events-chart.asp>)
were reported as number of events per 1 million vaccinees. Given this,
completeness of reporting of adverse events following vaccination will be
critical in today's environment in order to draw conclusions. It is
noteworthy that the military has begun smallpox vaccination, and as of this
weekend there has been one case of generalized vaccinia and one case of
post vaccina encephalitis reported out of 3665 military health workers
vaccinated (obtained from USA Today press release of 6 Feb 2003
<http://www.usatoday.com/usatonline/20030206/4842897s.htm>.) In the same
press release it mentions that out of 432 civilians vaccinated no serious
adverse events have been reported. While military and civilian health data
have been traditionally collected and analyzed separately, in this case it
would seem scientifically justified for the data to be shared and
comparatively analyzed; recognizing that the probability of capture of
adverse events from military personnel is greater than via the civilian
voluntary reporting system. We await results of this increased active
surveillance effort. - Mod.MPP]
