At least 14 botulism cases have been registered in Kyrgyzstan since the beginning of 2013, Disease Prevention and Examination Department of the Health Care Ministry of Kyrgyzstan reported.

According to the department, every year the republic records food poisonings mainly after consuming the home-made canned goods.

The department reported about 62 botulism outbreaks in the republic with 93 victims, 3 of whom died, in 2012. "All the victims got poisoning from food bought at natural markets, neglecting the main recommendations of the sanitary and epidemiological services," the department said.

[Home canning remains the primary risk factor for human botulism if the spores of the organism are not adequately destroyed by heat. This is particularly relevant in non-acid foods such as olives. - Mod.LL
