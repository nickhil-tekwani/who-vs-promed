Myxomatosis outbreak could see thousands die
--------------------------------------------
A deadly outbreak of the rabbit killer disease, myxomatosis, is spreading
across Huddersfield [Kirklees, south of Leeds, in northern England].
Hundreds of wild rabbits have already been killed by the virus, which is
spread by blood-sucking insects.
Several dog walkers have reported seeing dead rabbits daily on the Dalton
Bank Nature Reserve. Many of the rabbits have inflamed ears and eyes, which
are signs of the virus.
"There have been numerous dead rabbits or parts of rabbits around for the
past week," said Deborah Nicholson, of Kirkheaton, who regularly walks her
dog there. "The vet says the disease can't be passed on to dogs, but some
of the rabbits have either no eyes or very inflamed eyes, which are
symptoms of the disease."
John Avison, environment coordinator for the chemical company Syngenta,
Huddersfield, which manages the 50 acre nature reserve, said he was aware
of the outbreak. "It only kills rabbits, not hares, but it can affect
domestic rabbits," he said.
Mr Avison said the wild rabbit population had built up some resistance to
the virus, but 90 per cent could be wiped out by this outbreak -- about 60
per cent by the virus and 30 per cent by predators -- as it leaves the
rabbits blind and deaf and more at risk. He said he had seen 4 outbreaks of
the virus in the 27 years he had worked at the reserve, the last being
about 3 years ago. He urged dog walkers to keep their dogs on leads to
avoid vulnerable rabbits being attacked while ill.
Vet Sibaele Collins, who works in Huddersfield, said the virus did flare up
occasionally, but the surgery was seeing fewer and fewer cases in domestic
rabbits, because many owners were vaccinating against the disease. The
standard rabbit vaccination, which includes myxomatosis, costs about GBP 25
[USD 48].
Peter Bolton, animal welfare manager for the Royal Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in the north east, said the charity
strongly recommended owners of pet rabbits to have them vaccinated against
the virus. "It does exist in the wild rabbit population, which is why we
encourage people to vaccinate in case pet rabbits come into contact with
wild ones," he said. "It is an horrific death for rabbits, but
unfortunately it happens, and it is just nature's way of controlling the
rabbit population."

[Myxomatosis is endemic in the UK's fauna. The disease prevails also in
several other European countries, but some countries have reportedly
managed to eradicate it. Details on the etiological agent, relevant
diagnostic techniques, and requirements for vaccines and diagnostic
biologicals can be seen in chapter 2.8.1. of the Office International des
Epizootie's Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial
