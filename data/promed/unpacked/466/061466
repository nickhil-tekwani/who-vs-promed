[Ref: F Mukoyi et al: Detection of variants of wheat stem rust race
Ug99 (_Puccinia graminis_ f. sp. _tritici_) in Zimbabwe and
Mozambique. Plant Disease (2011) 95, 1188; DOI:
10.1094/PDIS-04-11-0300]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The migration of Ug99 variants of _Puccinia graminis_ f. sp. _tritici_
is of concern to global wheat production. 7 races have been
characterized in the Ug99 lineage, 3 of which occur in South Africa.

During surveys of wheat fields for Ug99 in Zimbabwe and Mozambique in
August and September 2010, high stem rust severities were found at
Chiredzi, Chisumbanje, and Birchenough in Zimbabwe and at Rotanda in
Mozambique. Stem rust was widespread in the lowlands (less than 800 m
[2600 ft] above sea level) of Zimbabwe and trace amounts were present
in the mid-altitude areas. In Mozambique, stem rust was only observed
at Rotanda.

Collections from Zimbabwe yielded viable urediniospores for infection
studies. According to race analysis conducted on seedlings of the
North American stem rust differential set, 2 were typed as PTKST, 2 as
TTKSF, and one [contained] both. Urediniospores of the Mozambique
isolate were not viable in infection studies. [All 6 isolates] yielded
fungal DNA for simple sequence repeat (SSR) analysis. Using 8 selected
SSR primer combinations, all isolates clustered within the Ug99
lineage.

Similarity in _P. graminis_ f. sp. _tritici_ races in Zimbabwe, South
Africa, and Mozambique suggests that inoculum is exchanged within the
region and explains the detection of race PTKST in South Africa in
2009 [see ProMED-mail post 20100602.1834].

Trajectory models showed winds originating at Birchenough in October
2009, where stem rust was observed, passing directly over
KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, within 48 to 72 hours. Race PTKST was
confirmed from collections in KwaZulu-Natal in November 2009. The
confirmation of Sr31 virulence in race PTKST in Zimbabwe is important
because it provides new geographical records for an Ug99-related race
and puts Southern African cultivars at risk.

[Wheat stem rust is caused by the fungus _Puccinia graminis_ f. sp.
_tritici_. Overall yield losses of up to 80 percent are reported, but
some fields are totally destroyed. New races are emerging, and the
most dangerous at present is strain Ug99 (discovered in Uganda in
1999), which has overcome the major resistance gene Sr31 used in our
current wheat varieties.

Since then Ug99 has spread and even more virulent variants able to
overcome additional resistance genes have emerged. A new source of
Ug99 strains was reported in South Africa in 2009 opening up
additional routes of transmission and increasing the threat in the
southern hemisphere (ProMED-mail post 20100602.1834).

Stem rust spores are spread by wind and with infected straw. Some
grasses or volunteer wheat may generate a "green bridge" providing
inoculum for the next cropping season. Disease management may include
fungicide applications, control of volunteer wheat, and resistant
varieties if available. Breeding programmes have been set up in
international cooperation (Delhi Declaration) to establish wheat
varieties resistant to Ug99 strains. The possibility of Ug99 strains
developing additional fungicide resistances can also not be excluded
and such strains would be even more difficult to control.
