BLUETONGUE - EUROPE (31): NETHERLANDS

The 1st clinical case of bluetongue in goats reported during the
ongoing BT-epidemic in North-West Europe was confirmed at 31 Aug 2007
in the Netherlands.
The holding containing 600 Dutch milking goats (and 5 healthy cows)
is located in Someren, in the southeast of Noord-Brabant province. 10
goats demonstrated clinical signs of bluetongue, starting with acute
drop in milk yield and pyrexia, followed by oedema of lips and face,
crusts on lips and muzzle, nasal discharge, conjunctivitis and
erythema of the udder.
The infection was confirmed by RT-PCR (all 6 sampled goats) and ELISA
(3 of 6 goats) by CIDC-Lelystad (Central Institute for Animal Disease
Control in Lelystad, part of Wageningen University and Research
Centre). Only one goat was found seropositive for bluetongue before
in the Netherlands in February 2007, but was negative in the RT-PCR
and did not reveal clinical signs.
Until now it was uncertain whether goats could develop clinical signs
after natural infection with BTV-8. Experimental infection of goats
with BTV-8 resulted in clinical signs (Backx et al., accepted for
publication in Veterinary Record).
In the Netherlands there are approximately 300 000 goats, 1.4 million
sheep and lambs and 2.5 million cattle. According to the last census
730 goat farms with 10 or more goats per farm exist. Most of these
farms are located in the eastern provinces of Gelderland and
Overijssel, the northern province of Friesland and the southern
province of Noord-Brabant.

We very much appreciate Dr. Piet van Rijn and colleagues assembling
this first-hand account. We are particularly pleased that the
information contains -- in addition to early clinical and laboratory
data -- a very good estimate of the populations at risk for this
disease. With the rapidity of spread seen in other countries and the
lack of effective disease control weapons at present, such estimates
are invaluable for gauging the magnitude of the animal problem at
hand and the ensuing economic consequences. - Mod.PC]
