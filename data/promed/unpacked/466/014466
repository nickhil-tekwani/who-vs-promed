Cases of Lyme disease in the UK may be 3 times higher than previous estimates, according to new research [1]. After analysing the anonymous medical records of 8.4 million people from across the UK, scientists forecast that the total number of Lyme disease diagnoses in the UK could top 8000 in 2019, compared with previous estimates of between 2000 and 3000 annual diagnoses.

Lyme disease is a bacterial infection, which is passed on through being bitten by an infected tick. The small spider-like creatures feed off the blood of animals and are typically found in dense, moist vegetation.

The research, published in the journal BMJ Open, found that 1/2 of cases occurred between June and August. Although there were diagnoses across all regions of the UK during the period studied, Scotland had the highest number of cases, at 27% of the total. The authors suggest this could be due to the region's wetter climate and popularity with hikers. The south-west and south of England also recorded a higher than average number of cases.

The data showed that the number of diagnoses increased almost 10-fold over the period studied. This, the researchers said, was partly down to increased caution by GPs and greater public awareness.

"The exact number isn't so important," said Dr Victoria Cairns, the lead author of the study. "The point is that it's a lot, and it's everywhere, and that's why people should be informed."

Dr Anne Cruikshank, the Royal College of GPs' clinical champion for Lyme disease, said: "These levels are not a big surprise to those of us who know about Lyme disease. I expect the 8000 figure may be an underestimate, since the data shows that positive lab results have doubled every 5 years."

Cairns said she hoped the new data would encourage the public to take more preventive measures, and bring about faster diagnoses. "The main thing that should come out of [this work] is to be on the alert. There's no need to panic, the treatment works -- but if you don't get it in time you might have some long-term problems."

Abstract
--------
"Objectives: The purpose of this study was to estimate the annual incidence of Lyme disease (LD) in the UK.

"Design: This was a retrospective descriptive cohort study.

"Setting: Study data were extracted from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), a primary care database covering about 8% of the population in the UK in 658 primary care practices.

"Participants: Cohort of 8.4 million individuals registered with general practitioners with 52.4 million person-years of observation between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2012.

"Primary and secondary outcome measures: LD was identified from recorded medical codes, notes indicating LD, laboratory tests and use of specific antibiotics. Annual incidence rates and the estimated total number of LD cases were calculated separately for each UK region.

"Results: The number of cases of LD increased rapidly over the years 2001 to 2012, leading to an estimated incidence rate of 12.1 (95% CI 11.1 to 13.2) per 100â€‰000 individuals per year and a UK total of 7738 LD cases in 2012. LD was detected in every UK region with highest incidence rates and largest number of cases in Scotland followed by South West and South England. If the number of cases has continued to rise since the end of the study period, then the number in the UK in 2019 could be over 8000.

"Conclusions: The incidence of LD is about 3-fold higher than previously estimated, and people are at risk throughout the UK. These results should lead to increased awareness of the need for preventive measures."

Lyme borreliosis (Lyme disease) is the most common human tick-borne infectious disease in the northern hemisphere, occurring predominately in temperate regions of North America, Europe, and Asia. It is caused by pathogenic genospecies of the spirochete, _Borrelia burgdorferi_ sensu lato group. Vectors of _B. burgdorferi_ are hard-bodied _Ixodes_ ticks, and various small and medium-sized mammals and ground-feeding bird species are reservoir-competent hosts.

The species of tick, the host species, borrelial genospecies, and carriage rates of borreliae in ticks all vary according to the geographical location. _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto is the main pathogenic species identified in North America. It also occurs in Europe but is less prevalent in most regions than _B. garinii_ or _B. afzelii_, the 2 major European pathogenic genospecies; All are present in the United Kingdom (UK), and _B. garinii_ appears to be the most prevalent pathogenic genospecies in most endemic areas of this country (https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140714115146/http://www.hpa.org.uk/webc/HPAwebFile/HPAweb_C/1309968694565).

Different clinical manifestations are often associated with these different genospecies. Erythema migrans (EM) and Lyme arthritis are more common in the United States than in Europe. In the US, as many as 80-90 percent of patients with Lyme disease develop the characteristic EM rash (http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/signs_symptoms/index.html); whereas neuroborreliosis [that is, Lyme affecting the nervous system], borrelial lymphocytoma [that is, bluish-red nodular swelling], and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans occur more frequently in Europe. Genetic differences between species within the _B. burgdorferi_ sensu lato complex may also result in problems with the serodiagnosis of Lyme borreliosis,

In Europe, _B. burgdorferi_ genospecies that cause Lyme borreliosis are mainly transmitted by the tick _Ixodes ricinus_. In a literature review of studies of the prevalence of _B. burgdorferi_ sensu lato in _I. ricinus_ ticks in various European countries, the overall mean prevalence of _B. burgdorferi _ in ticks was 13.7%; for the UK the prevalence ranged from 3.9 to 8.5 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1287732/).

Increases in incidence of Lyme disease are likely the result of several factors that include: 1) greater recognition, 2) improved reporting, as well as 3) a true increase in disease incidence due to a) more people living in suburban neighborhoods near wooded areas with b) enlarging populations of deer, which, although not susceptible to Lyme disease, supply the adult tick with a required blood meal, c) enlarging populations of both the white-footed mouse and other small rodents (the primary reservoirs for Lyme disease) and spirochete-infected nymphal _Ixodes_ species, and d) changing climatic conditions that favor proliferation of the tick, mouse and deer populations.

Lyme disease is endemic in many parts of the UK, particularly in woodland and heath-land areas, and occasional cases are acquired in peri-urban parks and recreational areas with suitable habitat. Laboratory-confirmed reports of Lyme borreliosis have risen steadily in the UK since reporting began in 1986; the mean annual incidence rates for laboratory-confirmed cases was 1.73 cases per 100 000 total population in 2015, when about 15-18% were reported to have been acquired abroad (http://www.patient.co.uk/doctor/Lyme-Disease.htm#ref3).

However, the study reported by the news article above says that the annual incidence of Lyme disease in the UK may actually be three times higher than current estimates (2000 to 3000 cases). As in the UK, Lyme disease is underreported in the U.S. Lyme disease became nationally notifiable in the U.S. in 1991 and the annual number of confirmed cases reported to the CDC since then has steadily risen. In 2013 the CDC reported that although more than 30 000 cases were reported annually, the C.D.C. estimated about 300 000 Americans get Lyme disease each year, 10 times higher than the yearly reported number (https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2013/p0819-lyme-disease.html and ProMED-mail post Lyme disease - USA (04): underreporting 20130822.1894924). - Mod.ML
