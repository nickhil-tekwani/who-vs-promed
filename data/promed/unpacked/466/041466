Year 2000 Serosurveys for West Nile Virus Infection:
New York and Connecticut Counties
--------------------------------------------
In 2000, 21 persons were reported with acute illness attributed to West
Nile virus (WNV) infection; 19 were hospitalized with encephalitis or
meningitis. Of the 21, 10 resided in the Staten Island borough (Richmond
County) of New York City. Other ill persons resided in 9 other counties:
Kings (Brooklyn), New York (Manhattan), and Queens counties in New York;
Hudson, Passaic, Monmouth, Morris, and Bergen counties in New Jersey; and
Fairfield County in Connecticut.
Because ill persons represent only a fraction of the those who are infected,
many more persons were probably infected in 2000. To determine the
prevalence of recently-acquired WNV infection and associated risk factors
for infection, random household cluster serosurveys were conducted in Staten
Island and portions of Fairfield County, Connecticut, and Suffolk County,
New York, during the period October to November 2000. All 3 areas had
intense WNV epizootics as determined by avian mortality and mosquito
surveillance systems.
This report summarizes the preliminary results of this survey and indicates
that in areas with intense epizootic WNV activity, asymptomatic or mildly
symptomatic human infections can occur. After obtaining consent, persons
aged greater than 12 years were interviewed to identify risk factors for
infection and submitted serum specimens for WNV IgM antibody testing.
IgM-positive samples were tested for WNV-neutralizing antibody.
A total of 2436 persons from 1989 (39%) of 5141 selected households
participated in the serosurvey. A total of 5 persons aged 14-54 years had
positive WNV IgM and neutralizing antibody tests indicating recent
infection. Of 871 residents of Staten Island surveyed, 4 had positive
samples indicative of recent infection. Of 834 surveyed in Suffolk County,
one had a positive sample, and of 731 surveyed in Fairfield County, none had
positive samples.
Of 176 persons reporting fever and headache during the period July to August
2000, 2 (1.1%) were infected recently, compared with 3 (0.1%) of 2222
persons who did not have these symptoms. However, persons recently infected
with WNV did not differ significantly from other surveyed residents by age
or sex. In 2000, hospital-based surveillance identified 10 Staten Island
residents with severe WNV neurologic illness (rate: 2.5 per 100 000
population). On the basis of Staten Island serosurvey data, an estimated
1574 residents aged greater than 12 years were infected with WNV in 2000; an
estimated one in 157 WNV-infected Staten Island residents developed severe
neurologic illness. In Suffolk County, although hospital-based surveillance
did not identify any persons with severe WNV neurologic illness, an
estimated 121 infections occurred among the approximately 100 500 persons
aged greater than 12 years in the serosurvey area.
[MMWR Editorial Note:
-------------------------------
In 2000, the estimated incidence of recent WNV infection in 3 survey areas
was less than the 2.6% estimated from a 1999 serosurvey in a north Queens
neighborhood (CDC and New York City Department of Health, unpublished data,
1999). One possible reason for the lower incidence in Staten Island compared
with Queens may have been that the 1999 WNV epizootic in Queens was more
intense than that in Staten Island. Although few data exist to compare the
epizootics in these boroughs, the seroprevalence of specific
WNV-neutralizing antibody among house sparrows was more than 6 times greater
in north Queens in 1999 than in Staten Island in 2000.
These differences may reflect the prevention measures implemented in 2000
that contributed to the decreased incidence in humans; these measures
included mosquito larviciding before the transmission season, wide
dissemination of public health messages promoting personal protection
behaviors, reduction of peridomestic mosquito breeding sites, and intensive
insecticide spraying to control adult mosquitoes. These differences also may
reflect the sporadic nature of WNV outbreaks.
Another important factor may have been the methods used to select the sites
for the serosurveys. The 1999 Queens site was a 3 square mile area where the
9 persons with severe WNV neurologic illness resided. Because the 10
case-patients in Staten Island were more evenly dispersed across the 56
square mile area, a sampling method that included the entire island was
used. In 1999, the serosurvey results in Queens may have been lower if a
wider area that included Queens neighborhoods with lower rates of severe
neurologic illness had been used.
Fairfield and Suffolk counties were surveyed because of the many
WNV-infected birds and mosquitoes reported. In Suffolk County, recent human
infections were identified in the survey, although no cases of encephalitis
were reported. In Fairfield County, although no recently infected persons
were found, public health surveillance identified a mildly symptomatic
resident with confirmed infection in 2000. The detection of WNV infection in
these counties suggests that in areas with very intense epizootics human
infections occurred but not at levels that resulted in recognized severe
neurologic illness.
Because older persons infected with WNV are more likely than younger persons
to develop severe neurologic illness, in areas with equally intense
epizootics and older residents, these lower infection incidences may still
result in severe neurologic illness.
The comparable ratio of severe neurologic illness to infection observed in
Queens in 1999 and Staten Island in 2000 suggests that, when adequate
surveillance for severe WNV neurologic illness is in place, surveillance
data may be used to estimate the WNV infection incidence from year to year.
The identification of 62 persons in 1999 and 20 in 2000 with acute WNV
illness suggests that approximately 3 times as many WNV infections occurred
in 1999 as 2000 despite a widely expanding epizootic in 2000. Although some
decrease in the rate of WNV infection in humans may be attributable to
vector control, other prevention activities, or the variable and sporadic
nature of WNV outbreaks, it is unknown why the estimated rates of infection
varied widely among the 3 survey sites in 2000 despite high levels of WNV
epizootic activity in each.
Additional analysis of the 2000 surveillance data will be necessary to
identify surveillance indicators of increased risk for human infection to
target prevention and control activities.
