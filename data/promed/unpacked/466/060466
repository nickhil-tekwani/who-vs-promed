The medical entomology unit of the Institute for Tropical Medicine
(French military medical service) has conducted in July 2007 an
entomological study in Libreville, Gabon. The objective was to assess
the risk of chikungunya [virus] transmission during the dry season
for the French [armed] forces. BG-sentinel traps and a mosquito
magnet trap were used. We caught 965 _Aedes albopictus_ (716 females
and 249 males) and 80 _Aedes aegypti_ (71 females and 9 males) in 15
days. Our virology unit found 2 pools of _Aedes albopictus_ females
containing chikungunya virus. No dengue [virus-] infected [mosquito
pools] have been found in either species.
In Libreville, _Aedes albopictus_ seems to be the vector of the
chikungunya outbreak that occurred beginning in April [2007]. The
persistence of _Aedes albopictus_ [chikungunya virus] - infected
populations during the dry season is worrying. A resumption of the
outbreak could occur at the beginning of the rainy season.

[The Gabon Ministry of Health reported 5000 cases of suspected
chikungunya virus infection in Libreville in May 2007 (see ProMED
archive no. 20070519.1591). ProMED requests information about efforts
to control _Aedes_ mosquitoes there. ProMED thanks Dr. Page for this
latest report, and requests further information if further
entomological studies are done or should the chikungunya virus
outbreak resume when the rains begin.
