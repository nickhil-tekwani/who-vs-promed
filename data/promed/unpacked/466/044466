MOKO DISEASE, BANANA - SAINT LUCIA: ALERT

Banana industry officials in St Lucia have placed the island on high alert
for the possible arrival of Moko disease. Moko disease has now been
discovered in St Vincent and the Grenadines [see ProMED-mail post
20070521.1617], hence the reason for the alert. The Banana Emergency
Recovery Unit (BERU) has warned that extreme care should be exercised in
the movement of people and materials among islands and between fields in
order to prevent an outbreak of Moko [in St Lucia].
Hilary La Force, head of the BERU said that for all its seriousness, black
Sigatoka, a windborne disease, is mild when compared with Moko, a disease
that has affected the banana crop in Grenada for years. The disease has
been kept out of St Lucia because of the excellent quarantine measures
adopted by the Ministry of Agriculture.
La Force also emphasized that the BERU has been importing tissue culture
banana plants from Israel and the planting material is completely free of
black Sigatoka, yellow Sigatoka, or Moko disease. The unit continues to
exercise even greater care and does not import planting material from any
country where black Sigatoka or Moko disease exists.
Since Moko disease has been discovered less than 20 miles (32 km) south of
St Lucia, La Force said that this is not good news for the island as the
disease has now gotten "too close for comfort." La Force said that measures
have to be put in place to ensure that the disease does not reach our
shores as this could mean the end of what is left of the banana industry,
and plant parts of bananas or plantain material are strictly prohibited
into St Lucia.

[Moko disease was 1st reported in Trinidad in the late 1890s leading to
severe losses of Moko cooking bananas. It is caused by the bacterium
_Ralstonia solanacearum_ invading the vascular tissues of the host.
Affected species include banana, plantain, heliconia, red ginger, taro,
castor bean, and some weeds. The disease affects all plant parts with
symptoms of wilting, fruit rot, blackening of suckers, and bacterial ooze
leading to a quick death of the plant. Moko is endemic in South America and
is also present in the Philippines.
_R. solanacearum_ is a species complex with 3 "races" (pathovars). Race 2
affects banana and plantain. Moko, Bugtok, and blood diseases of banana are
caused by different strains of race 2. The bacterium is spread by water,
wind, infected plant material or soil, and mechanical means including
animals and insects. Ornamentals and weed species may serve as pathogen
reservoirs. Infection can occur via roots or flowers depending on the host
cultivar and pathogen strain.
Moko is one of the most serious banana diseases with reported yield losses
of over 70 per cent. No resistant banana cultivars are known. The primary
means of control is exclusion from areas that are disease-free and
eradication of infected plants where the pathogen is present. It has severe
commercial implications of yield losses and high costs of control measures
needed.
There are 2 types of Sigatoka leaf spot. Black Sigatoka (BS), also known as
black leaf streak, is caused by the fungus _Mycosphaerella fijiensis_.
Worldwide, black Sigatoka is one of the most devastating leaf diseases of
bananas causing yield losses of 50 per cent or more. Yellow Sigatoka (YS)
is caused by the related species _M. musicola_. Symptoms of both diseases
are often similar. However, BS is more serious than YS because symptoms
appear on younger leaves and therefore more damage is caused to
photosynthetic tissue. BS also has a wider host range and affects many
cultivars of banana and plantain that have resistance to YS. For both,
disease management includes frequent applications of fungicides and
cultural practices. The high costs of these measures make them essentially
unavailable to smallholder farmers.
