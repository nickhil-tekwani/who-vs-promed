China: Outbreak of Respiratory Disease in School Children in Guangzhou
---------------------------------------------------
According to local media, Guangzhou Health Department stated that
since March 2005, the number of cases of influenza increased
significantly, due to the fact that Guangzhou entered its peak
influenza season. A different local newspaper, stated that 8
hospitals were reporting a significant increase in flu patients. For
example, Guangzhou Second Hospital reported on an increase of 50 000
flu patients compared with the 1st quarter of 2004.
Similarly, multiple newspapers, including Guangzhou Daily, reported
on several influenza outbreaks in local schools and kindergartens.
Guangzhou Department of Health reported on an outbreak of influenza
in a Guangzhou kindergarten, where the Principal reported sick
children almost daily. On 8 Apr 2005 the health office of the
kindergarten sent a notice to all the parents to give their parents
counter-disease medication, for example Banlangen [the dried root of
_Isatis indigotica Fort._] medication, for 2 days, and not to take
their children to places where there is little circulation and where
people are densely packed (i.e. cinemas, stores, restaurants, or
hospitals).
In the Xianliedonglou Elementary School in the Tianhe area, the
school doctor told reporters since school started they have been
doing checkups every morning on the children, and everyday there are
1 or 2 reports of influenza. In March 2005, there were 2 or 3 days
when the number of children with influenza exceeded 10, with the
highest being 12 on a single day. There have also been many reports
of teachers getting influenza, although newspaper did not provide a
concrete number of infected teachers.
In Xianliedonglou Elementary School, the 5th grade class of 51
students had 10 students with acute viral respiratory infections of
varying complexity. The Xianliedoonglou Elementary School uses UV
light to disinfect the classrooms, offices, etc. every day. If
morning checkups find a child with a fever, he/she will be
immediately taken to the health room to have his/her temperature
taken and parents will be asked to take the child to the hospital
for further diagnosis. Only after the inspection of the school
doctor can the child return to school. In December 2004, the school
also gave its 527 students influenza vaccinations.
Jiubuqian Elementary School has been boiling vinegar in classrooms
and has been spraying acid once a day, everyday, and has been using
the acid to rub down the tables and mop the floors.
Elsewhere, in March 2005 Hong Kong Commercial News reported that that
Macau is experiencing an influenza peak, with cases increasing
sharply. In the first 2 weeks of March, Jinghu hospital in Macau
received nearly 7000 upper respiratory tract infection patients.
Compared with the same period of last year, the incidence increased
more than 100 percent. Doctor of the Jinghu hospital stated that most
patients are children.

[In this report acute upper respiratory tract infections are
generally described as cases of influenza virus infection. However,
the reports contain no confirmation of a specific diagnosis. The
predominance of children among those infected would be compatible
with influenza B virus infection. However, these outbreaks may
merely reflect the expected winter/spring peak in upper respiratory
tract infections, which could be attributed to one or more of a
diverse range of respiratory virus pathogens. Further information
would be welcomed. - Mod.CP]
