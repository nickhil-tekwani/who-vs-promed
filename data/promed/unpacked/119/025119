The first suspect case of yellow fever (YF) in Bahia State this year was
notified on 18 Jan 2000 to the State Health Secretariat. The patient is a
male, aged 48 years, resident in the upper middle class suburb of Itaigara,
Salvador [capital of Bahia State, who works in the city of Nazare, Goias
State, an area endemic for YF.
Family members and contacts are being vaccinated. Blood specimens have
been sent to the Institute Evandro Chagas in Belem, Para State, and results
will be available in 7 days. Mosquito collections are being made around
the patient's residence and neighborhood. The houses are being treated
with insecticide and outdoor spraying is being done in the streets.
The number of posts for YF vaccination in the state have been increased
from 14 to 55, and the Ministry of Health has sent 1 million doses of
[Brazilian YF vaccine to add to the 600 000 already in stock there.
