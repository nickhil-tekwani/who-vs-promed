Although Rift Valley fever has been confirmed in the current outbreak
affecting humans and livestock in Kenya and Somalia, it is evident that
other causes have contributed to the high rate of haemorrhagic symptoms and
deaths among both humans and animals. Laboratory investigations at the WHO
Collaborating Centres at Kenya Medical Research Institute in Nairobi,
National Institute for Virology in Johannesburg and at Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta have tested specimens from Kenya and
Somalia for a wide range of infectious agents but so far the only clear
diagnosis is RVF which has been confirmed by virus isolation or implicated
through the demonstration of specific IgM antibodies in a 30-40% of samples
tested.
Preliminary epidemiological studies have shown that the flooded areas of
north-eastern Kenya are most likely to have suffered mainly from Rift
Valley fever and that the virus may have reached the area some time in
November-December 1997. The disease is widespread but presenting with
typical RVF symptoms which are in general mild in humans but causing
abortions in sheep, goats and camels. Animal vaccination, which would be
the most efficient control measure for RVF, is not considered feasible
under the current conditions in the affected areas.
Severe haemorrhagic disease is not common for RVF and the absence of RVF
virus antibody in about two-third of viral haemorrhagic fever cases tested
in the laboratory is a further indication that another infectious or toxic
agent is involved. Contrary to the RVF outbreak [as a whole, the severe
cases of haemorrhagic illness have occurred in localized clusters.
Unfortunately, these clusters have been reported in remote flooded areas in
the northeast near the border with Somalia which are very difficult to
reach. WHO and the Task Force in Nairobi are now establishing a base in
Garissa for further investigations of the cases of haemorrhagic fever.
The international team coordinated by WHO will include members from Epiet,
Paris, Epicentre of Medecins Sans Frontieres, the National Institute for
Virology in Johannesburg, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and
the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, Fort
Detrick. The team will be equipped with a locally rented helicopter to
access areas otherwise difficult to reach. The establishment of the team
has been made possible thanks to financial support of WHO and the
Department for International Development, United Kingdom.
