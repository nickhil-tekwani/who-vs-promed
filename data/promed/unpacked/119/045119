A youth, aged 14, resident of Candelaria, in Rio Grande do Sul
[state], died on Friday [16 Jan 2009] after presenting symptoms of
multiple diseases, some similar to yellow fever [YF], according to
the Secretary of Health of the State.

The youth, who according to the secretary lived in a region that is
not in area at risk, was transferred to Santa Cruz do Sul

[Samples for] the laboratory tests to discover the cause of death
were taken to the Adolfo Lutz Institute in Sao Paulo, and [results]
should be ready to send here in 2 weeks, according to the
secretariat. At least 2 cases of yellow fever have been confirmed in
Rio Grande do Sul this year [2009].

[This patient resided in an area well to the east of the previous YF
cases in the state (see map below), which was near the border with
Argentina. According to this report, the 2 earlier suspected YF cases
in Rio Grande do Sur (see ProMED archive no. 20090118.0211) have now
been confirmed. If the above case is also YF, that brings to 3 the
number of YF cases in the state this month (January 2009). This
report provides no information about a vaccination effort in the area
where the youth resided.
