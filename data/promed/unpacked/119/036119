_Tomato ringspot virus_ in _Punica granatum_ in Italy
------------------------------------------------------------
The NPPO [National Plant Protection Organisation] of Italy recently informed EPPO [European Plant Protection Organisation] of the detection of _Tomato ringspot virus_ (_Nepovirus_, ToRSV - EPPO A2 List) in _Punica granatum_ (pomegranate) trees. In 2012, the University of Bologna had imported cuttings of 126 cultivars of _P. granatum_ for fruit production and ornamental purposes from the USDA/ARS [Agricultural Research Service] clonal germplasm repository, California. This planting material was introduced in accordance with EC directives.

Rooted cuttings were planted in January 2013 in an experimental field in Emilia-Romagna region under post-entry quarantine. In spring 2013, no symptoms were observed but samples were collected and tested for the presence of several viruses. In autumn 2014, the presence of an unspecified nepovirus was detected. In May 2015, further analysis confirmed the presence of ToRSV.

However, before these final results, plants from the experimental field had been given to 5 other farms in Emilia-Romagna, as well as to the University of Bari (Puglia region) and to a nursery in Lazio region. ToRSV was detected in the 5 farms in Emilia-Romagna. It is also noted that when the presence of ToRSV was finally confirmed, some of the initially asymptomatic plants had started to show ringspot symptoms on the leaves.

Official phytosanitary measures will be taken to eradicate the disease. All pomegranate plants of US origin will be uprooted and destroyed. As the nematode vector, _Xiphinema americanum_ sensu lato is not known to occur in Italy, natural spread (if any) is considered to be limited. Surveys will be carried out within a radius of 500 m around infected sites, as well as in nurseries located within a radius of 1 km, in particular to verify the health status of _P. granatum_ plants that are sold to growers and gardeners.

ToRSV symptoms on tomato crops had been reported in Italy in the 1980s, but the virus had never been confirmed by laboratory analysis. In a survey in 1981 on viruses and virus-like organisms of _Rubus_ spp, ToRSV was detected in an asymptomatic raspberry plant (_Rubus idaeus_) in an experimental plot in the province of Trento, which had probably been imported from abroad. Since then, no other records of ToRSV had been made from Italy.

[_Tomato ringspot virus_ (ToRSV; genus _Nepovirus_) has a wide host range mainly of perennials, including herbaceous as well as many woody species. Symptoms vary with hosts and virus strain, but may include distortions, line or ring patterns on leaves, stunting and reduced vigour of plants. Asymptomatic infections pose a high risk of virus spread.

ToRSV can be transmitted by mechanical means (contaminated tools), as well as with infected planting and grafting material. Varying degrees of seed and pollen transmission have been reported in different hosts. Natural vectors of the virus are adults and larvae of dagger nematodes (_Xiphinema_ species). The vectors occur mainly in North America, but the virus has been disseminated to many countries with infected planting material and there is some evidence of field spread in locations like Japan and Russia. Disease management relies mainly on phytosanitation (for example, disinfection of pruning tools) and use of certified clean rootstocks and scions.

Quarantine measures are vital to prevent introduction of crop viruses with new plant material, including tissue cultures and other forms of germplasm. In the case above, the infected plants came from an official government source, but it appears that they may not have been certified as virus free and molecular testing was not carried out in quarantine before release into the field. Even if natural spread may not occur in Italy, the presence of infected nursery stock will require molecular testing and certification of propagation material to prevent yield losses in orchards.
