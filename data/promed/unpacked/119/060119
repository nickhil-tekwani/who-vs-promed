I confront veterinary students with this type of contamination of feed
during their training. Through feed it may also reach humans (even in the
developed countries) by secondary carry-over and is therefore an issue of
(Veterinary) Public Health.
For this reason it is of importance to know methods to decontaminate feed.
I suppose that if these methods work for feed, why won't they for food?
Before I will give a list of these methods, I must admit that not all of
these methods are practical on a large scale in the situation in which
Somalia is at this moment. Furthermore, it is likely that some of these
methods will introduce other problems. I also want to stress that my
suggestions may need further backing up from other food scientists.
Method 1 (milling).
-----------------------
After dry and wet milling of corn AFT is concentrated in by-products. The
starch-rich fraction shows only low contents. Discard by-products and
process starch rich fraction.
Method 2 (chemical treatment).
-------------------------------------
Ammonia treatment. This is carried in two ways (1) high pressure and high
temperature or (2) atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature. Treatment
may give a reduction of 95 to 98% of AFT content. As the first option is
probably not practical in Somalia, I will focus on the second. The
procedure of that process is to spray a solution of 13% ammonia on seeds.
The seeds are then incubated at 25 to 45 degrees Celsius for 14 to 42 days
in sealed bags.
Inactivation using chemicals may be impractical or potentially unsafe. They
may also affect the wanted nutrients. Furthermore, the taste (flavour,
odour and colour) of the products will be affected.
Method 3 (Adsorbents).
-----------------------------
Adsorbents include zeolite, activated charcoal, hydrated sodium calcium
aliminosilicate, bentonite, yeast cell wall products and many more. These
materials have different modes of interactions with the toxins. Immobilised
AFTs and adsorbents will leave the body with the faeces.
Adsorbents are effective but the problem with adsorbents is that they also
absorb nutrients. One has therefore to consider the occurrence of
deficiencies.
Method 4 (fermentation)
------------------------------
Microbial degradation of AFTs is possible with numerous organisms,
including bacteria, yeasts and algae. They show variable abilities to
degrade AFTs: the most active and efficient is Flavobacterium aurantiacum
(when clinical effects of this bacterium are expected: heat the food
thoroughly before consumption). Also the addition of 0.1% Saccharomyces
cervisiae (Baker's yeast or Brewers yeast) to the diet followed by an
incubation period is found effective against aflatoxicosis.
An optimised combination of methods 3 and 4 is commercially available as
MycoFix, a product of Biomin in Austria. However, this product is less
efficient for AFT contaminations.
Furthermore, AFTs are sensitive towards UV light (the sun!). Efficient
degradation of AFT is however dependent on their concentration and length
of the exposure.
