A fourth case of BSE has been reported in Belgium in a herd of 82. The
infection arose in the same western part of the country as 2 of the 3
previous cases. Up to now the origin of none of the 4 cases could be found.

The Belgian agriculture ministry was cited as saying in a statement today
that a four-year-old cow from a farm in Tielt, in the province of West
Flanders, was diagnosed with mad cow disease or BSE (bovine spongiform
encephalopathy) earlier on Monday and that an entire herd of 82 cattle
would be destroyed. This was the country's fourth case of mad cow disease.
The story said that the ministry was trying to establish the cause of the
contamination but noted that the animal was born on the farm.
[Perhaps what we are seeing in Belgium is the start of the European BSE
epidemic. If transmitted from UK bone meal or animals, the lower inoculum
and incubation times could have delayed visible onset for 10 years. If so,
the number of cases in Europe should accelerate. Presumably the EU has
banned all animal-ruminant feeding, so the epidemic would then peak in the
2001-2004 time frame. -- RAL

The Belgian Agriculture Ministry said on Thursday it could find no precise
cause for a case of "mad cow" disease found in Belgium earlier this year
and concluded it was a "sporadic case."
Belgium has reported three cases of mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE), since the first case was announced in October last year.
The Agriculture Ministry said that, on the basis of the three recorded
cases, a consultative group set up by the Belgian government believed that
"no conclusion can be drawn about the future development of BSE in Belgium."
The ministry announced the results of an investigation into Belgium's second
case of BSE, at Ruddervoorde in western Flanders, which was confirmed on
March 10. It said it seemed unlikely the disease had been transmitted from
the cow's mother. Cattle feed used at the farm contained no animal meal and
investigators could find no other likely cause in the management of the
farm, it said in a statement.
That only left the possibility that this was a "sporadic case," meaning a
case whose origin could not be linked to an exact cause, the ministry said.
Since 1994, when a BSE monitoring system was created, 139 cows had been
registered at the farm which had the BSE case. Of these, 50 cattle at the
farm at the time were destroyed. Tests for BSE on these slaughtered cattle
had so far been negative. Of the rest, four calves were found to be still
alive in Belgium and these were destroyed, the ministry said. Another 20
cattle had been exported. "The countries concerned have
been immediately informed about this," the ministry said, without specifying
the countries.
The ministry said it was still investigating the latest BSE case, at
Waarschoot, eastern Flanders, announced on March 30. The 124 cattle at this
farm had been slaughtered and incinerated. The brains of the 76 animals more
than two years old were being examined to see if they carried BSE, it said.
Investigators seeking the origin of this case were focusing on another farm
in the same area where the cow was born before being sold in 1996. The
investigators traced 17 cattle still alive in Belgium and 29 which had been
exported from the farm where the BSE case was found. They also traced 43
cattle still alive in Belgium and 38 exported from the farm where the cow
was born. All of these were being destroyed and incinerated, the ministry
said....

[In Last's "Dictionary of Epidemiology" (1983, OUP, p99), 'sporadic' is
defined as "Occurring irregularly, haphazardly from time to time, and
generally infrequently, e.g., cases of certain infectious diseases." Maybe
this term is now inappropriate in the Belgian context of BSE. Enough is
known about this disease that with four outbreaks the authorities should be
able to do better than claim sporadicity - a ratite word. If they were all
the result of spontaneous mutations, it is an extraordinary coincidence and
then raises the question, "If in Belgium, why has it not been also seen in
France, Germany, Denmark, ...?" If they are the result of the coincidence of
infrequent contributory events, there should be enough data now to identify
them and the circumstances. There may be more prosaic explanations. The
Belgian government veterinary service has an extraordinary opportunity to
add meaningfully and positively to the epidemiological knowledge of BSE.
