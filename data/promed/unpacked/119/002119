Another person has died in Chile from hantavirus [infection,
bringing the death toll from the virus since 1993 to 48, health
officials said Monday.
According to Valdivia province health officials, one other person is in
critical condition and 5 patients are under observation for symptoms of
hantavirus, which is carried by small rodents.
Chilean veterinarians say there are 60 species of mice in the country, of
which 32 are in some way related to the field mouse (_Oligorizomys
longicaudatus_), making it possible that any of them could carry hantavirus
and other similar diseases.
Since 1993, when the virus was first detected, there have been 92 confirmed
cases in Chile, with 48 deaths.
Hantavirus, discovered in the 1960s by a Korean doctor, begins to
affect humans from one week to 45 days after exposure. The
disease causes flu-like symptoms, but kidney and lung
complications develop and cause death in 50 percent of the cases.
Data show a mortality rate of 50 percent in the more than 300
cases diagnosed in Latin America since 1994.
