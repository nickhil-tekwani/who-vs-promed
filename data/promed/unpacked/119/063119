The Department of Health (DOH) on Friday [16 Oct 2009] said that it
has declared a leptospirosis outbreak in 3 villages in Marikina City,
and that the total number of cases in Metro Manila has surged to 1027
with 89 fatalities. Barangay ['barrio', the smallest administrative
division in the Philippines] Tumana, Malanday, and Concepcion I of
Marikina had at least 5 cases each of leptospirosis.

Health secretary Francisco Duque III said, "We have declared an
outbreak there, but by outbreak, we do not necessarily mean that we
have a big number of cases. We can declare an outbreak if previously,
the place had no case of the disease, then suddenly, several cases
were reported."

Parts of the Philippine shoe capital are still flooded, which serves
as the main avenue for the disease-causing bacteria to enter through
human skin.

Some areas in Metro Manila and Region IV-A (particularly Calabarzon
or the provinces of Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, and Quezon) were
like Marikina, one of the most affected by the heavy rains brought by
tropical storm Ondoy 3 weeks ago.

Weather reports said that Ondoy dumped more than a month's worth of
rain in about 9 hours. Meanwhile on Friday [16 Oct 2009],
undersecretary Romeo Momo of the Department of Public Works and
Highways (DPWH) said that some areas in Marikina and Pasig were
expected to remain flooded for up to 5 more months -- even longer if
there were more rains. "[Waters would go down by] 1.3 centimeters
[0.5 in] per day with the assumption that there will be no more
rains," he added.

The total number of leptospirosis cases in Metro Manila alone as of
[15 Oct 2009], (1027) has already surpassed last year's [2008] total
number of cases nationwide (769). Metro Manila, or the National
Capital Region, is comprised of 16 cities and a municipality and is
home to about 8 to 10 million people. Quezon City has the most number
of cases in the capital region with 122, followed by Marikina, with
82. Manila has 49 and the most number of patients (273) were admitted
to the San Lazaro Hospital. Rizal province, one of areas worst
affected by Ondoy, also reported 54 cases.

Health authorities are alarmed by the sudden increase in
leptospirosis cases in just 4 days, especially in Metro Manila. Duque
said that on Monday [?12 Oct 2009], there were only 140 reported
cases in Metro Manila. The figure shot up to 344 after a day and
surged to 700 by Wednesday [?14 Oct 2009].

On Friday [?16 Oct 2009], the Health department convened its Task
Force Ondoy and resolved to provide prophylaxis to 1.3 million people
in Metro Manila and in Calabarzon where people are exposed or at risk
of contracting the disease. The floodwaters in some parts of those
areas, particularly communities around Laguna de Bay, are not
expected to recede until December.

The Health department has allotted PHP 30.4 million [approx USD 650
000], half of which would be provided for the health needs of 760
projected complicated cases, and the other half to the needs of the
projected 3040 uncomplicated ones.

Duque also said that 19 private hospitals would also admit
leptospirosis incidents in case the 12 health department-run
hospitals and those operated by the local governments could not
accommodate the surge of patients.

Leptospirosis is caused by swallowing the bacteria directly from
water, absorbing them through cuts in the skin, or through food. The
disease, which is commonly associated with rat urine, can also come
from animals like cattle, pigs, horses, dogs, and wild animals.

The disease can also be passed through human-to-human contact, said
Dr Lyndon Lee Suy of the health department's emerging and reemerging
infectious diseases. He was the guest at the weekly media forum in
the Rembrandt Hotel in Quezon City on Friday [16 Oct 2009]. He
advised people to be vigilant, given the surge in cases suggest an
epidemic. But he also said that people needed to remain calm.

Symptoms of the disease may appear suddenly -- sometimes as early as
4 days after exposure, or other times as late as 21 days. Common
signs and symptoms are flu-like and include fever, a red skin rash,
and general weakness. Headaches, reaction to light, muscle and joint
pains, vomiting, and fatigue are also common. The incubation period
may last up to a month.

Duque said, "We strongly advise anyone who had a history of wading in
the recent floods and who has the symptoms of the disease to consult
at once the nearest doctor or health facility for treatment."

The death toll from leptospirosis reached 89 as cases of the
flood-borne disease in Metro Manila and flooded provinces rose
10-fold in the past 3 days, the Department of Health (DOH) reported
yesterday [16 Oct 2009].

Health secretary Francisco Duque III said the number of leptospirosis
admissions in public hospitals in Metro Manila alone soared from 140
on 12 Oct 2009 to 1027 as of 15 Oct 2009. Duque added that the 89
leptospirosis deaths brought to 8.6 percent the fatality rate from
last year's [2008] 7.5 percent. "Cases of leptospirosis have really
shot up these past few days. In fact, the Metro Manila figure even
exceeded the 812 nationwide admissions in government hospitals for
the whole of last year," Duque disclosed. In Rizal province alone,
Duque said a total of 54 leptospirosis cases have been recorded since
1 Oct 2009. "As we start to see in the National Capital Region (NCR),
we also expect a lot of cases in the communities in Rizal, which make
up the biggest number of barangays still under water at this time,"
Duque noted.

He said the DOH has also declared an outbreak of leptospirosis in 3
Marikina barangays, Tumana, Concepcion, and Malanday. "Although fewer
than 5 cases were recorded in each barangay, we declared an outbreak
because those areas had zero incidence of the infection last year
[2008]," Duque said.

Based on a DOH estimate, Duque said 1.7 million people are at risk of
acquiring leptospirosis since many areas in Metro Manila and
Calabarzon are still submerged. Of the 1.7 million at risk, Duque
said, more than 3000 are likely to manifest symptoms of the
potentially fatal infection. "We expect 3800 people to get the
infection and of this number, 3040 will suffer uncomplicated symptoms
while the rest will manifest complicated symptoms that would require
them to undergo dialysis or face eventual death," Duque said.

To protect the more than a million people currently exposed to
leptospirosis, the DOH has embarked on a massive preventive treatment
operation and awareness campaign. Yesterday [16 Oct 2009], Duque said
a team from the DOH has already started giving prophylaxis capsules
[doxycycline, 200 mg orally, once weekly, has been shown to be
effective for short-term prophylaxis in high-risk environments
(Takafuji ET, Kirkpatrick JW, Miller RN, et al: An efficacy trial of
doxycycline chemoprophylaxis against leptospirosis. N Engl J Med
1984; 310(8): 497-500; abstract available at
<http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/310/8/497>. - Mod.ML]
in barangays in Marikina where there is a leptospirosis outbreak.
Duque said the DOH hopes to provide preventive treatment to 1.3
million people from Calabarzon [region located just southeast of
Metro Manila and the 2nd most densely populated region] and the NCR
who were affected by flood and exposed to possible leptospirosis infection.

"For the next 3 weeks, we will be giving 100 mg prophylaxis capsule
[?doxycycline] once a week to those at risk of acquiring the
infection," Duque said, adding the preventive treatment operations
would cost the DOH some PHP 12 million [approx USD 250 000]. Duque
said the DOH would also allocate PHP 30.4 million [approx USD 650
000] for those people who are already infected and manifesting
complicated and uncomplicated symptoms of the disease. Medical
experts clarified that the prophylaxis would only protect the people
for a week, thus they are encouraged to avoid wading in floodwaters,
especially if they have an open wound.

At this time, Duque said all the 19 government-run hospitals in Metro
Manila are on standby for admissions of more leptospirosis patients.
"In case the DOH-run hospitals were not able to accommodate all the
patients, we have already an agreement with some private hospitals
and local government-operated hospitals to admit the spillovers,"
Duque said. "We are closely monitoring incidence of leptospirosis,
which is now the most critical of the diseases affecting the
typhoon-affected regions of NCR and Calabarzon," he added. Aside from
leptospirosis, DOH also recorded high incidence of respiratory tract
infection, skin wounds, and diarrhea among residents of NCR and Calabarzon.

Duque said the DOH is also closely monitoring areas severely ravaged
by typhoon "Pepeng" [typhoon Pepeng (international codename Parma)
made landfall on the island of Luzon that includes Metro Manila on 3
Oct 2009, several days after typhoon Ondoy. - Mod.ML]. "We are
conducting surveillance in the Ilocos Region, Cagayan Valley, and
Central Luzon, but there are no reports of outbreaks of flood-borne
diseases," Duque said. Meanwhile, DOH regional director Rio Magpantay
said Nueva Ecija has the most number of leptospirosis cases among
flood-affected provinces in Central Luzon. A total of 55 people in
Nueva Ecija contracted leptospirosis and 4 have already died from the
disease. In Tarlac, 16 cases were noted with one fatality, Bulacan
has 12 reported cases with one death and Pampanga has 5 cases with
one casualty. Aurora, on the other hand, has one case and one death
reported, Magpantay said.

Leptospirosis is a bacterial infection associated with rat urine that
can lead to kidney failure. But Magpantay explained that the
infection could also come from animals like cattle, pigs, horses,
dogs, and wild animals. Symptoms include fever, a red skin rash, and
general weakness. Headaches, adverse reaction to light, muscle and
joint pains, vomiting, and fatigue are also common symptoms.

In spite of the rising cases of leptospirosis in the country,
Malacanang [Malacanang Palace is the official residence of the
President of the Philippines] refused to say that this was alarming
and expressed confidence that the concerned authorities would be able
to address the situation. Press secretary Cerge Remonde said that the
Palace is "concerned but not alarmed" by the reported deaths from
leptospirosis. Remonde said that the president has ordered the DOH to
deploy more health workers to flood-affected areas where clustering
of leptospirosis cases was reported. He pointed out that one of the
1st directives issued by the president after Metro Manila was hit by
heavy flooding brought about by storm "Ondoy" was to clean up the
streets of garbage as well as the draining of floodwaters. "This is
being done but the problem is really more complicated in some of the
areas, so the draining would take some time to complete," Remonde
said in Filipino. He said that the Palace and the National Disaster
Coordinating Council (NDCC) are aware of the problems in the
evacuation centers, particularly the risk of disease spreading among
the evacuees. "This is one of the reasons why we have to clear these
evacuation centers soon because the longer the evacuees stay in the
evacuation centers, the more susceptible they are to the spread of
diseases," Remonde said. He also reported that multinational
pharmaceutical company Pfizer, through its medical director Dr
Anthony Leachon, has committed to donate medicine to treat leptospirosis.

Meanwhile, a group of medical organizations asked the government
yesterday [16 Oct 2009] to divert its budget for health-related
infomercials to arrest the outbreaks of leptospirosis. Dr Julie
Caguiat, spokesperson of Samahang Operasyong Sagip (SOS), said the
government should "decisively act" on the surging number of
leptospirosis patients and other potential outbreaks in areas
devastated by back-to-back storm Ondoy and typhoon Pepeng. "If the
government has money to pay for medical advisories, print ads, it
must have more funds for disease outbreaks," she noted in a statement.

While the DOH had reportedly directed its hospitals to provide free
services to leptospirosis victims, the SOS has been receiving reports
that many patients were being turned away due to lack of facilities.
"These are extraordinary moments, which require extraordinary
decisions by the government. Most of the disaster-affected
communities are the urban poor who have no means to pay for medical
services at this point," Caguiat added. She maintained the government
should spend more money to ensure adequate treatment and management
of patients than spend for infomercials.

[The 2 news reports above described what is apparently a rapidly
developing major public health problem as a result of 2 typhoons that
hit the island of Luzon in the Philippines within days of each other
and caused widespread, persistent flooding. There may be some
confusion as to the number of cases of leptospirosis in Metro Manila:
The 1st news report does not specify the time period over which the
reported 1027 total cases of leptospirosis occurred or what type of
patient was involved, but the 2nd report clearly states that most of
the 1027 cases of leptospirosis occurred over a 4 day period of 12-15
Oct 2009 and involved hospitalized patients.

Leptospirosis is caused by swallowing _Leptospira_ in contaminated
water or on food, or by absorbing it through cuts in the skin.
Doxycycline has been found to offer some protection against severe
illness. In a flood-affected area, leptospirosis chemoprophylaxis is
doxycycline 200 mg, once a week for those exposed to contaminated
flood water or soil. Each 200 mg dose provides a benefit for up to 7
days, so the dose may be repeated if high-risk conditions persist
longer than this. People exposed in flooded fields should be
cautioned against direct contact with contaminated water or mud and
should be advised to use rubber shoes or boots and gloves. Broken
skin should be protected with a waterproof dressing. All food and
drinking water should be protected against contamination. All
drinking water should be boiled unless it is known to be absolutely
safe. Fresh vegetables and fruit should be washed in clean water and
then cooked or peeled. _Leptospira_ exist in the urine of several
'reservoir' species, most commonly rats, but also other rodents,
cattle, pigs, sheep, and horses. It is usually spread by the urine of
a carrier animal that contaminates water or food. Because rodents are
the major reservoir of _Leptospira interrogans_, rodent control
measures should be undertaken.
