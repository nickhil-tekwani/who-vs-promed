A viral outbreak in China has sickened more than 6300 people and
killed another child, raising the death toll to 26 children,
authorities said Monday [5 May 2008].

The latest fatality from enterovirus 71 (EV71) was in coastal
Zhejiang province, the provincial Health Ministry said. It said 1198
other children have been stricken in the province with the virus. It
appealed for any sick children "to be sent immediately to health
clinics" and for the cases to be reported "immediately to health and
education departments."

An additional 5151 cases have been reported in neighboring Anhui
province, where 22 children have died, according to the official
Xinhua News Agency. Most of the cases were near Fuyang, a
fast-growing city in the central province's rural heartland.

Xinhua also reported 3 deaths in the southern province of Guangdong.

Enterovirus 71 causes a severe form of hand, foot and mouth disease,
with symptoms including fever, mouth sores and rashes with blisters.
It is easily spread by sneezing or coughing. The virus mainly strikes
children aged 10 or younger. Some cases lead to paralysis and fatal
swelling of the brain.

The illness is not related to foot and mouth disease, which afflicts
livestock. There is no vaccine or specific treatment, but most
children affected by mild forms of the disease typically recover
quickly without problems. The World Health Organization says the
virus [infection] normally peaks in June and July, so there could
still be an increase in infections as the weather warms.

The outbreak is another headache for China's Communist government as
it prepares to host this summer's [2008] Olympic Games, already
tarnished by unrest among Tibetans in western China and an
international torch relay disrupted by protests. WHO's China
representative, Hans Troedsson, said the disease was not a threat to
the Beijing Olympics because the disease mostly sickens young
children.

China's Health Ministry has sent teams to Anhui to coordinate
treatment of the disease and prevent its spread. State-run television
showed workers spraying disinfectant around houses in rural areas
outside Fuyang and medical teams visiting families with small
children.
