A bite by a wild squirrel is suspected to be the cause of the death
of a 7-year-old boy after contracting rabies. The child, hailing from
Pavithreshwaram in the district [of Kollam], succumbed to the viral
attack at the Thiruvananthapuram Medical College Hospital on Wednesday
night [6 Jul 2011]. He [had been] admitted in the hospital 4 days
[previously].

The parents of the child said that 3 months ago one afternoon while
sleeping, they heard the boy cry. They rushed to him and saw a
squirrel running out of the room. On examining the child, they found
that the squirrel had bitten him. Some traditional medicine was
administered to him then. The boy attended school after the vacations
and did not show any signs of being infected with rabies. But, 5 days
ago, he showed symptoms of fever, drooling, and weakness. The parents
rushed him to a nearby hospital, from where he was referred to the
medical college hospital, relatives said.

[Merritt Clifton comments: "I'm a bit skeptical of this report:
Squirrels are not a common rabies vector anywhere, since they tend to
die quickly if infected, but there are other fatal diseases that they
could transmit which would also produce a very high fever. The victim
could very well have had contact with a rabid dog. However, the victim
does not appear to have received proper post-exposure rabies
vaccination."

On the other hand, although some species of squirrels are docile and
easily tamed, others can be aggressive. Remarkably, in a study of
animal bites undertaken in Iran, squirrels ranked 3rd after dogs and
cats in terms of frequency of human bites, ahead of monkeys and other
potential rabies vectors (Eslamifar A, et al., Arch Iran Med. 2008
Mar;11(2):200-2). Since squirrels are susceptible to rabies, it is not
inconceivable that, on occasion, they may transmit rabies virus
infection to humans.
