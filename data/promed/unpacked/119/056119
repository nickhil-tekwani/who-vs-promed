A Dallas nurse who contracted Ebola was released from Emory University Hospital in Atlanta on Tuesday [28 Oct 2014] after being found free of the virus and thanked God and her family for helping her recover. "I sincerely believe that with God all things are possible," said nurse Amber Vinson, who looked vibrant at a news conference with the health workers who treated her. Vinson is the 4th patient successfully treated for Ebola at Emory's hospital. She was one of 2 nurses from a Dallas hospital infected with Ebola after treating the 1st patient diagnosed with the disease in the United States.

[2] USA: Rapid test deployed in hospitals
Date: 27 Oct 2014

Rapidly screening for Ebola at U.S. hospitals has just gotten easier thanks to military-funded technology. Salt Lake City-based BioFire announced over the weekend that they had received emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration for hospital workers to use their polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening machine, the FilmArray, to screen for Ebola.

It's the same machine that the U.S. military is using to fight the disease in Africa. But until Sat [25 Oct 2014], the FDA had approved FilmArray for Ebola screening for research purposes only in U.S. hospitals. http://www.defenseone.com/threats/2014/10/dallas-hospital-had-ebola-screening-machine-military-using-africa/96713/?oref=search_the%20film%20array.

The Dallas hospital that treated Thomas Eric Duncan, the Liberian man who became the 1st individual to die of Ebola in the United States, [had the machine] but was not authorized to use it to test patients showing symptoms of Ebola.

Health workers in more than 300 hospitals around the country, including 30 hospital labs in the New York tri-state area, use the machine to screen for a wide variety of illnesses such as listeria, influenza and various other respiratory and intestinal sicknesses. With the right diagnostic kit in place, the FilmArray can also be used to screen for Ebola, delivering results in about an hour with higher than 90 percent certainty. More importantly, it can do so days before an Ebola carrier develops a fever and becomes contagious. One of the hospitals scheduled to receive the machine for that purpose is New York's Bellevue.

Doctors and medical staff at Emory University in Atlanta were able to use it to diagnose and treat U.S. doctor Kent Brantly and aid worker Nancy Writebol because the machine there had a research designation http://labmed.ascpjournals.org/content/45/3/e109.full?sid=0d415b4f-6cda-429c-81a1-ecf0c07c929e.

BioFire, a subsidiary of BioMerieux, began the process of requesting emergency use authorization on 22 Sep 2014 and finally got in the last necessary results and paperwork on 22 Oct 2014, according to an FDA spokesperson...

The availability of more and better Ebola screeners in more hospitals will allow authorities to much more rapidly evaluate potential Ebola cases and do so before symptoms like fever present themselves, in other words, before the carrier is contagious [and] poses a threat. That means that random screening with an effective PCR machine could decrease any public health threat from an individual, without being quarantined.

[3] USA: (New York, New Jersey) quarantine rules relaxed
Date 27 Oct 2014
Source: NY Times [edited]
http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/27/nyregion/ebola-quarantine.html?_r=0


Facing fierce resistance from the White House and medical experts to a strict new mandatory quarantine policy, New York State Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on Sun Oct 26 2014 evening that medical workers who had contact with Ebola patients in West Africa but did not show symptoms of the disease would be allowed to remain at home and would receive compensation for lost income. He said his decision balanced public safety with the need to avoid deterring medical professionals from volunteering in West Africa. "My No. 1 job is to protect the people of New York, and this does that," he said. Those quarantined at home will be visited twice a day by local authorities, he said. Family members will be allowed to stay, and friends may visit with the approval of health officials.

After Mr. Cuomo's announcement, Mr. Christie [New Jersey state governor] issued a statement saying that, under protocols announced on Wed Oct 22 2014, New Jersey residents not displaying symptoms would also be allowed to quarantine in their homes. Yet amid heightened public anxiety about the government's handling of the crisis, state authorities have increasingly calculated that the mandatory quarantines will prove prescient. Since the governors' announcement, Illinois and Florida have said they were instituting similar measures. On Sun Oct 26 2014 afternoon, President Obama gathered top advisers for a meeting at the White House to work on a new, nationwide standard for returning health care workers. That policy is likely to advise against a total quarantine of those workers, a senior administration official said.

[4] USA: New federal Ebola guidelines
Date: 27 Oct 2014
Source: Guardian [edited]
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/27/ban-ki-moon-concerned-ebola-restrictions


The UN secretary general praises "exceptional" health workers and says "those who develop infections should not be stigmatised..."

The White House appeared to accept on Mon [27 Oct 2014] that a patchwork system of Ebola restrictions was inevitable given that public health policies were a matter for individual states. "We have a federal system in this country in which states are given significant authority for governing their constituents," White House spokesman Josh Earnest told a briefing. "That is certainly true when it comes to public safety and public health..."

In Georgia, governor Nathan Deal appeared to sidestep the controversy by announcing detentions for all travellers potentially exposed to the disease, but exempted healthcare workers, who will be allowed to monitor themselves at home and choosing other restrictions that may have limited practical impact. Deal said officials at the Atlanta airport, one of 5 designated entry points for travellers from Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, would rely on questioning arrivals on their potential exposure to determine whether they should face the mandatory quarantine detention.

Georgia's rules are likely to provoke less controversy than those in New York and New Jersey by allowing travellers to be monitored at home via video link or visits from officials. "We have learned from what other states have done, especially in the area of healthcare workers where we saw some push back," said Deal. "We believe our policy will give them the freedom they deserve; we trust them to report if they have symptoms." Travellers arriving via Atlanta from affected countries who do not exhibit any symptoms or admit to a history of exposure will be required to sign an agreement requiring them to monitor their temperature and stay in touch with authorities for a 21-day period.

The CDC director again stressed that Americans were highly unlikely to contract Ebola. "I understand that people are afraid. People are unfamiliar," said Frieden. "It is a severe disease, but it is not highly contagious."

[5] An African viewpoint
Date: 21 Oct 2014
From: Nigeria Health Watch [edited]
http://nigeriahealthwatch.com/mass-hysteria-in-the-west-and-the-real-problem-next-door


This blog was inspired by a conversation with my friend and colleague Dr Kelechi Ohiri while we watched some of the media coverage of the Ebola outbreak on cable news channels, while acutely aware of our own reality in West Africa.

We recently heard the story of some Korean businessmen cancelling their trip to Nairobi for a conference because of ...wait for it... the Ebola outbreak in Liberia and Sierra Leone. The distance from Nairobi to Monrovia is about 5000 km, about the same distance as between London and Washington, but hey, it is Africa, and there is Ebola in Africa.

The hysteria manifests itself in several forms: Sierra Leone's John Kamara was barred from returning to his Greek club after playing for his country in Yaounde, Cameroun; 2 students from Nigeria who applied to a Texas college were told they wouldn't be admitted because of Ebola; and flights are now being disrupted daily due to Ebola scares. Conspiracy theories on the source of the outbreak and the virus's potential for mutation continue to gain strength with many audiences.

While the hysteria by a few uninformed private individuals and companies may be sad and easily dismissed, it becomes a real challenge when apparently enlightened and responsible citizens take to the airwaves in the same way. There appears to be serious and increasing pressure by parts of the American population, especially Republican lawmakers, to institute an air travel ban to "isolate" West Africa (a term now used to describe a geographic area 2 times the size of Europe, with 15 countries). The apparent purpose of this is to close America off to travelers from the region and protect Americans from exposure to the ebolavirus. This solution is being proffered by panelists invited on several prime time television channels and beamed across the world.

They should know better. There is no evidence that a travel ban can work, and such a ban is likely to cause more harm than good. We will explain. Let's consider why this must be taken seriously.

Firstly, it will not be the 1st time the USA has instituted a travel ban against public health counsel. For many years, those infected with HIV were barred from entry into the USA. There is no evidence that it had any effect at all on the epidemiology of HIV in the USA, but, despite this, it remained in place for 22 years until it was repealed by the Obama administration.

Secondly, hysteria has already led to several countries around the world re-instating airport temperature and symptom screening despite all the evidence that airport screening did not work for SARS in 2006, nor did it for TB in the UK, and there is absolutely no evidence that it will work for Ebola. Despite the constant preaching on the importance of evidence-based decision making in the health sector, the UK and the US as well as several other countries, including Nigeria, have re-instated or introduced airport "screening." This comes in the form of various types of equipment used to measure temperature as well as a self-reported symptoms screening questionnaire. The Liberian Thomas Duncan, who entered the US while incubating Ebola virus did not have a fever on arrival, and honesty in those filling out airport forms is really too much to expect, especially knowing what the consequences of that honesty are likely to be. But by instituting screening at airports, governments are seen to be responding. There is a lot of pressure to be seen to be doing something, even in the absence of any evidence of effectiveness. The only benefit airport symptom and temperature screening has caused is [to the virus. - Mod.JW], an increase in queues and congestion. In an airport like the Murtala Mohammed International in Lagos, this causes additional chaos and congestion, providing the perfect environment for the transmission of infectious diseases.

Apart from providing much needed jobs for hundreds of Nigerians, given what we know about the disease, its natural history and the incubation period of the virus, this exercise is most likely to be ineffectual and very expensive... Just a few weeks ago, there was extensive and severe criticism of the Sierra Leonean lockdown in its attempt to limit transmission, as not being based on evidence, but now everyone seems to be on the bandwagon.

Temperature screening at Lagos Airport
----------------------------------
The very nature of international travel and international travelers makes the proposal of a travel ban naive at best and most likely to make things worse rather than better, an argument made brilliantly by Laurie Garrett in her article "Why travel bans will only make the Ebola epidemic worse." Thankfully, most of the Public Health Leadership in the USA, including the CDC director Tom Frieden, have come out strongly against this. The WHO does not recommend it as a means of controlling the outbreak. There was very little discussion in the mainstream media about a travel ban from China during the SARS outbreak in 2002 or during the Swine Flu epidemic in 2009. Maybe there is something particularly uncomfortable for some folk in America with an outbreak taking place in Africa. So are we facing another round of hysteria-driven public health policy?

Despite the hysteria, the facts remain that the risk of acquiring an Ebola infection in the USA, UK or anywhere in the West remains vanishingly small. The virus is not airborne and cannot be transmitted like some other viruses such as measles or the SARS virus can. Close contact with a patient is required for transmission.

Just one death from Ebola has occurred in the USA, and medical care there is light-years ahead of the medical care available in Liberia, where more than 2000 people have died in the ongoing outbreak. If left without a robust response, the hysteria will hurt us, and not just our brothers and sisters in Liberia, Sierra Leona and Guinea, but all of us. This outbreak must not be allowed to evolve to become our "single story."

So what do we recommend?
-----------------------
Everything we know about outbreaks of infectious diseases has taught us that the best way to control an outbreak is to identify its source and focus our control efforts there. All of us in the global community, North and South must put all our resources into supporting the response in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. It is worth noting that, while various panic-driven interventions are being put in place, the UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon is saying that there is still a significant shortfall in the resources needed for tackling the outbreak. There has been a lot of criticism of the West in responding late; we have heard little being said for our own countries in Africa.

In August 2014, the AU announced a contribution of USD one million; South Africa has sent a mobile laboratory and is considering a mobile hospital. Nigeria announced that it was sending volunteers, with little description of the institutional framework for their potential deployment. Below is a graphic describing the contributions to the international Ebola response efforts. You can draw your own conclusions.

[The UK alone has pledged more than the African Development Bank, and not a single African country appears in the top 14 donors, which include 3 American foundations pledging USD 100 million between them. - Mod.JW]

As I said in an interview at TEDGlobal, it is time we truly commit to dealing with this outbreak as a global community, not just for the "West Africans," but for all of us. The boundaries we hold so dear are not respected by infectious diseases. While we are at it, and despite all the pressure, our leadership, both political and in public health, must stick to the evidence of what works. We need calm heads to lead us through this. It is too early yet to count the heroes, but they may emerge from surprising places; doctors and nurses that have paid with their lives, working in the most grueling of circumstances, communities coming together to look after orphaned children and rebuild their lives.

We hope that the story of this outbreak will ultimately be one of solidarity and partnership and not of victims and saviours. We are in the middle of an unprecedented public health emergency at our doorstep. While it is fitting to celebrate small battle victories, we must not lose sight of the context of a larger war. We need to get over our hysteria and focus on Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.
