Isolation of a novel arbovirus associated with acute encephalitis in Viet Nam
------------------------------------------------------------------
The Central Hygiene and Epidemiology Institute identified a new arbovirus,
which causes acute encephalitis, in Vietnamese children. The virus,
[isolated in] a culture from a 20-month-old child in the northern province
of Nam Dinh, is transmitted by mosquitoes. According to Dr. Phan Thi Nga,
head of the institute's Encephalitis Virus Division, the new arbovirus,
named Nam Dinh virus, is as dangerous as Japanese encephalitis virus, which
is also appearing in some northern provinces.
"The virus was found in some patients in Ha Noi and Ha Tay in 2003, but we
do not have a vaccine yet," said Nga. "However, people should not worry
about an epidemic. We only identified the virus to isolate the disease for
study. The new arbovirus appeared in children in Bac Giang Province in
2004, but there were many more cases of Japanese encephalitis virus
infection," said Nga. Deputy Director of the Central Pediatrics Hospital
Nguyen Van Loc said that the number of children admitted had dropped, even
though the weather in northern provinces remained hot and muggy, a perfect
climate for mosquitoes. Loc said the hospital has received 240 encephalitis
patients since early May 2004. 31 patients died, and 40 percent were
diagnosed with Japanese encephalitis virus infection.

[The basis for identification of this ence
phalitis-associated virus, as a mosquito-transmitted arbovirus, is not
revealed in this report. Since all members of the family _Flaviviridae_ are
serologically related, it may be that Nam Dinh virus has been identified as a
flavivirus by cross-reactivity with antibodies to another flavivirus, such as
Japanese encephalitis virus, in ELISA or hemagglutination-inhibition binding
assays. On the basis of the information contained in this report, it is
equally possible that this isolate is a variant of Japanese encephalitis
virus, a novel flavivirus, or, a virus belonging to a taxonomically-distinct
group of arthropod-transmitted viruses. However, there are several other
possibilities, and further information is awaited to authenticate this claim.
Furthermore, the name Nam Dinh virus must be regarded as provisional until
considered, and approved, by a relevant Study Group of the International
Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses. - Mod.CP]
