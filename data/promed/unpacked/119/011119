A dog from Detroit tested positive for rabies, a 1st in the state since 2011, according to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) and Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD).

Officials said the 6-month-old dog had never been vaccinated against rabies. The last rabid dog detected in the state was in 2011 in Oakland County.

"Rabies virus is present in the saliva and brain tissue of an infected animal," said Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, chief medical executive and chief deputy for health for MDHHS.

"People can be exposed to rabies when they are bitten by a rabid animal. Other possible routes for exposure include getting infectious material in your eyes, nose, or mouth or on fresh cuts in the skin. Make sure pets are vaccinated, and avoid contact with stray or wild animals to reduce your risk of exposure to this potentially fatal disease."

Officials said testing to determine the strain in the infected dog continues. The state is working with the Detroit Health Department to take all necessary precautions.

"We are taking proactive steps to keep residents and their families safe," said Detroit Health Department Chief Public Health Officer Denise Fair. "We will have teams going door-to-door in the area to inform residents and educate on the importance of getting their family pet vaccinated. We will also be canvassing for any other injured or sick animals."

Officials said the family of the infected dog reported it had an altercation with another animal in their yard. Individuals who came in close contact with the dog have been referred to healthcare providers.

A total of 7 rabid animals -- including the dog -- have been detected in 2021. The 6 other animals are bats detected in Clinton, Ingham, Kent, Midland, Oakland, and Ottawa counties.

"Pet and animal owners should contact their veterinarian about vaccinating animals against rabies," said state veterinarian Dr. Nora Wineland. "While the full extent of the disease in Michigan's skunks and bats is unknown, it is important to understand that rabies is out there. Vaccinating animals and avoiding contact with wildlife will help to limit the spread of the disease."

The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) and Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) are urging Michigan residents to have their pets and animals vaccinated against rabies after confirmation that a 6-month-old dog in the City of Detroit (Wayne County) tested positive for rabies.

The infected dog had never been vaccinated against rabies. Prior to this instance, the last rabid dog in the state occurred in 2011 in Oakland County.

While any mammal can be infected with rabies, the virus is typically carried by skunks or bats in Michigan. Testing to determine the strain of rabies in the infected dog is still taking place.

The state is working closely with the City of Detroit Health Department to take all necessary precautions.

The family of the rabid dog reported it recently had an altercation with another animal in their yard during the night. Individuals who came in close contact with the infected dog have been referred to healthcare providers so their need for post-exposure prophylaxis treatment (PEP) can be evaluated. Combined with prompt wound cleansing, appropriately administered rabies PEP is uniformly effective in preventing rabies in exposed individuals.

State law requires dogs and ferrets be vaccinated against rabies by a licensed veterinarian. It is also important to make sure cats, even those kept strictly indoors, be vaccinated against rabies.

["Rabies is a preventable viral disease of mammals, most commonly transmitted by a rabid animal bite. The majority of reported cases occur in wild animals such as raccoons, skunks, bats, and foxes. The virus infects the central nervous system resulting in disease within the brain and then death.

"In people, the symptoms initially include fever, headache, and general weakness or discomfort. As the disease progresses, the signs become more severe, including insomnia, anxiety, confusion, slight or partial paralysis, excitation, hallucinations, agitation, increase in saliva, difficulty swallowing, and fear of water. Typically, death occurs within days after the onset of these symptoms." http://michigan.gov/emergingdiseases

Rabies is a serious disease. Vaccinate your pets against this deadly disease. If your pet is without the vaccine and is bitten by a rabid animal, it will be euthanized. If you keep your pets up to date on the rabies vaccine, you can prevent the pet's death and perhaps save your own life or certainly save yourself the necessary shots of post exposure.

If you are bitten by an animal, wash the bite site with soap and plenty of water, and seek medical attention. You may require a series of vaccine shots called post exposure prophylaxis (PEP).

If your vaccinated pet is bitten, wash the wound and take your pet to the veterinarian. A booster rabies vaccine is usually required.

If your pet is not vaccinated but is bitten by a rabid animal, it will be humanely euthanized. There is no treatment for an animal which has not been vaccinated against rabies. - Mod.TG
