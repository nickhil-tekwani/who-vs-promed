Thousands of openbill storks in Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya's Phak Hai
district have died, with avian influenza thought to be a possible cause.

A vast wasteland in tambon Khok Chang of Ayutthaya is home to tens of
thousands of Asian openbill storks [_Anastomus oscitans_, Order
Ciconiiformes, Family Ciconiidae. Picture at

-Mod.AS]. It is one of the largest flocks of birds in Ayutthaya.

A few days ago, thousands of Asian openbill storks died without apparent cause.

Residents are worried the flock might have been infected with the
bird flu virus, as Phak Hai district was one of many areas nationwide
reported with the virus outbreak last year [2009]. They want
authorities to investigate why the birds have died.

"Bird carcasses lie scattered over the wasteland and the canal bank
nearby, sending out a bad smell all over the place," Vichien
Puanglamjiak, a local farmer said.

Phak Hai district chief Rewat Prasong has warned residents to stay
away from the area.

Health experts and veterinarians will collect samples from the
carcasses to determine the cause of the birds' death, he said.

Mr Rewat said the birds might have eaten some kind of toxic aquatic
animal or they might have been poisoned by farmers who raised fish
which were eaten by the birds.

In his view, the bird flu virus was unlikely to be the cause of the
deaths, as it usually spreads in the early winter season, not in the
summer. However, it was not being ruled out in the investigation,
said the district chief.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall

[Information on the results of field and laboratory investigations of
the described event will be appreciated. In 2004, HPAI H5N1 virus was
reportedly found in 2 out of 15 sampled Asian open-bill storks in
Thailand (see 20041214.3303). - Mod.AS]

[The tone of this report is of "thousands" dying in a short period of
time, which is odd. We have had HPAI long enough in this region to
expect a measure of background immunity and to ask: "Why now?" My
first take on this, even if the numbers are more in the range of
hundreds, is that I would first suspect an intoxication or poisoning.
- Mod.MHJ]

[The weather should be investigated. Birds are very sensitive to
temperature and weather changes. It can cause disorientation and for
some birds who are migrating birds, when fat stores are lost, they
can easily deplete their energy stores in a storm and die from exhaustion.

A thorough necropsy will tell us more about the condition of the
birds and the possible cause of death. It would be unlikely for this
many birds to be affected by avian influenza all at once.

However, if the carcasses are not picked up quickly, then botulism
can form in the carcasses. As the maggots move in they consume the
carcasses and other birds may eat the maggots, and thus become
poisoned by botulism. - Mod.TG]
