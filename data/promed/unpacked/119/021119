Cholera reared its ugly head in Singapore again, after an absence of six
years. Eight people at a wedding celebration last month had severe
diarrhoea, were hospitalised and tested positive for the infection.
The outbreak has been traced to contaminated ice, which was used to chill a
banana-flavoured drink served during the wedding reception. An unlicenced
food caterer had been hired to provide the food and refreshments.
Investigations by the Environment Ministry revealed that ice blocks, which
had been transported on an open lorry and covered with only a plastic
sheet, had been put into styrofoam boxes for use in refreshments. The boxes
had been obtained from a wet market and had previously been used to
transport raw fish and other food products from suppliers to the market
stalls.
A total of 47 people, including seven food handlers engaged by [the wedding
couple] were screened for the bacteria, after a part-time food stall
assistant at the hospital tested positive for cholera. Of these, six guests
and a food handler also tested positive.
The last cholera outbreak in Singapore occurred in 1993, when 12 people
were infected after eating partially-cooked green mussels that were caught
near a site where sewage was discharged into the sea.
