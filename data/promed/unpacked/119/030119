Teams hunt for signs of bird flu outbreak in southwestern Cambodia
-----------------------------------------------
Health and agricultural officials have begun searching villages in
southwest Cambodia for signs of illness in people and poultry, after
a woman from the area died of bird flu, the World Health Organization
said on Wednesday [9 Feb 2005].
The government-appointed teams are also charged with educating
Cambodians on how to avoid catching the deadly H5N1 virus from
infected birds, the U.N. agency said. The teams have been telling
Kampot residents to avoid unnecessary contact with infected poultry.
"Increased efforts to educate the public about avian influenza will
be crucial in the detection and control of any future outbreak," Jim
Tulloch, WHO's representative in Cambodia, said in a statement.
Joining the campaign, a local radio station has been making hourly
broadcasts on the need to take precautions, WHO said.
A 25-year-old woman from the southwestern province of Kampot died of
the virus on 30 Jan 2005 in a hospital in Viet Nam. At least 45
people from Viet Nam, Thailand and Cambodia have died of bird flu
over the past year [2004]. Investigations were continuing to
determine how the Cambodian woman became infected, WHO said.
The deceased woman's 14-year-old brother died before she did, after
experiencing a respiratory illness, but no samples were collected for
testing before his cremation. The rest of her family tested negative
for bird flu.
On Sunday [6 Feb 2005], Cambodia reported a new bird flu outbreak
among chickens near the capital, Phnom Penh.
