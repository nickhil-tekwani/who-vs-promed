Thousands of chickens drop dead in Trinidad
-----------------------------------------------
Thousands of chickens have mysteriously dropped dead at several farms
in Trinidad over the last 4 weeks, but authorities ruled out the
deadly bird flu virus as the cause.
Agriculture Minister Jarette Narine said that veterinarians and other
health workers visited the farms in the eastern agricultural district
of Cumuto on Tuesday [10 Jan 2006] to carry out investigations and to
take samples from the dead chickens. "What they are saying to me is
that it is not to be worried about," Narine told a local radio
station. Narine ruled out avian influenza.
The H5N1 bird flu strain is known to have killed at least 78 people
since 2003, and some medical experts fear it could mutate into a form
more easily passed between humans, threatening a repeat of past
influenza outbreaks that killed millions around the world.
Narine said health officials believed the chickens in Trinidad were
dying because of a fungal disease of the respiratory tract caused by
_Aspergillus fumigatus_, a kind of mold.
The government said the affected farms would be quarantined until
laboratory results confirm the cause of the deaths.

[The article does not give many details about the condition of the
birds or their housing. There are a number of diseases, including
Newcastle disease, and infectious laryngotracheitis that may cause
sudden death in large numbers of poultry.
Air quality and overcrowding may also play a role. Fungal infections
could be another possibility.
We look forward to more detailed information regarding a diagnosis. - Mod.TG]
