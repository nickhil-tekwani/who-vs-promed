[Cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in the Southern Federal District were registered since April 2014. The 1st CCHF case in this region appeared in the Rostov region. There were also cases of CCHF in the Stavropol Territory. - Corr.BA]

[In the ProMED-mail post of 27 Aug 2013 (archive no. 20130827.1906334), Mod.CP noted, "The Rostov region includes natural foci of CCHF virus infection. In 2012, 41 cases of CCHF were recorded in the region, and there were 48 cases in 2011, including 8 cases belonging to a nosocomial cluster. The maximum number of cases (81 patients) was recorded in 2008.

Rostov Oblast is a federal region of Russia, located in the Southern Federal District. Rostov Oblast has an area of 100 800 square km (38 900 sq mi) and a population of 4 277 976 (2010 census), making it the 6th most populous federal subject in Russia.

[4] UK ex Bulgaria
Date: Thu 3 Jul 2014
Source: GOV.UK, Public Health England press release [edited]
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/crimean-congo-haemorrhagic-fever-case-identified-in-uk


PHE [Public Health England] is aware of a laboratory-confirmed case of CCHF in a UK traveller who was bitten by a tick while on holiday in Bulgaria. The patient is responding well to treatment and there is no risk to the general population.

As a precautionary measure, close contacts of the patient, including hospital staff involved in the patient's care, will be given health advice and encouraged to contact their GP if they experience symptoms.

Although Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) can be acquired from an infected person, this would require direct contact with their blood or body fluids, and the risk even for close contacts is considered very low.

This is the 2nd laboratory-confirmed case of CCHF in the UK, following the diagnosis in 2012 of CCHF in a UK resident who had recently returned from Afghanistan.

CCHF is the commonest viral haemorrhagic fever worldwide. It is not found in the UK but is endemic in many countries in Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Eastern Europe, including Turkey and Bulgaria.

People most at risk are agricultural workers, healthcare workers and military personnel deployed to endemic areas. CCHF is most often transmitted by a tick bite, but can also be spread through contact with infected patients or animals.

Dr Tim Brooks, Head of Public Health England's (PHE's) Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory (RIPL), said: "It's extremely rare to see a case of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever in the UK, and it's important to note there is no risk to the general population. As a precaution, close contacts of the patient will be contacted and monitored, but the risk of transmission is very low and would require direct contact with bodily fluids."

Notes to editors:
PHE is unable to disclose information on the hospital where this patient is being treated, due to patient confidentiality.

Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a viral haemorrhagic fever caused by a virus of the Nairovirus group. CCHF is a zoonosis, and infects a range of domestic and wild animals. It is spread via the bite of an infected tick. CCHF was 1st described in Crimea in 1944, among soldiers and agricultural workers, and in 1969 it was recognised that the virus causing the disease was identical to a virus isolated from a child in the Congo in 1956.

Symptoms of CCHF include fever, muscle aches, dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, backache, headache, sore eyes and sensitivity to light. Nausea, vomiting and sore throat may also occur, with diarrhoea and abdominal pain.

CCHF should be not be confused with Ebola haemorrhagic fever, and there is no connection between this incident and the current outbreak of Ebola in West Africa.

[ProMED thanks Tony Ellam for sending in this report. He also provided another report (http://nathnac.org/pro/clinical_updates/cchf_exbg_040714.htm) that has some useful information as follows:

"Advice for travellers:
- Travel-associated cases are rarely reported and the risk of CCHF to tourist travellers visiting endemic areas is very low provided precautions are taken. The majority of cases of CCHF occur amongst those working in agriculture including animal husbandry, veterinarians or animal slaughter workers.
- Healthcare workers are at risk from direct (unprotected) contact with the blood, body fluids or tissues of an infected person.
- Travellers to affected areas are advised to take measures to minimise their exposure to ticks. These include:
-- Wear clothing with long sleeves and long trousers (tucked into socks), which can be treated with insecticide sprays such as permethrin.
-- Apply insect repellent (DEET) to exposed skin.
-- Check the body for ticks regularly. Larval ticks are tiny and difficult to see. Adult ticks, once they have fed and become engorged, may be the size of a coffee bean. Common areas for ticks to attach are at the hair-line, behind the ears, elbows, backs of knees, groin and armpits.
-- Remove ticks as soon as possible by using a pair of tweezers or tick remover. The tweezers should be placed as close as possible to the skin and then the tick pulled slowly, ensuring the mouth parts are removed. Care needs to be taken not to squeeze the stomach contents into the site of the bite.
- Animal handlers should take precautions to avoid exposure to blood and tissues of livestock and healthcare workers should observe appropriate infection control measures.

There is no vaccine to prevent CCHF.

Outbreaks of CCHF are listed in the NaTHNaC Outbreak Surveillance Database.

Advice for Health Professionals:
- Health professionals who suspect a case of CCHF in a traveller should consult their local infectious disease specialist.
- A VHF [viral hemorrhagic fever] risk assessment protocol is available for health professionals who are assessing unwell returning travelers."

This report also lists several relevant references.

British health providers were alert in making the diagnosis quickly, implementing appropriate barrier nursing and informing close contacts of the patient. This case illustrates the fact that in this age of rapid international transportation, individuals infected with CCHF virus can turn up anywhere in the world. Good travel histories of patients are essential.
