Highly pathogenic influenza A viruses (inf. with) (non-poultry including wild birds), USA
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Started: 19 Apr 2022
Confirmed: 5 May 2022
Reported: 10 May 2022
Reason for notification: unusual host species
Causal agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza virus
Serotype: H5N1
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory

Outbreak location 1: Rock County, Wisconsin
Started: 19 Apr 2022
Epidemiological unit: other
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Red fox (_Vulpes vulpes_): Canidae-Carnivora / - / - / 1 / - / - / -
Affected population: captive wild red fox kit (_Vulpes vulpes_) at a rehabilitation facility.

Outbreak location 2: Waushara County, Wisconsin
Started: 24 Apr 2022
Epidemiological unit: other
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Red fox (_Vulpes vulpes_): Canidae-Carnivora / - / - / 1 / - / - / -
Affected population: captive wild red fox kit (_Vulpes vulpes_) at a rehabilitation facility.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: contact with wild species, unknown or inconclusive.

Epidemiological comments: highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1, Eurasian lineage goose/Guangdong clade 2.3.4.4b was confirmed in 2 wild red fox kits from Rock and Waushara Counties (in Wisconsin). The animals were found displaying neurological signs and taken to rehabilitation facilities, where they since have died. Full genome sequencing is pending. Testing is also underway for several additional fox kits found at the time of the 2 confirmed cases. This is the 1st report of HPAI in mammals in the United States.

Wild control measures applied: surveillance within the restricted zone, official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste, disinfection.

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL), Ames, Iowa (National Laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Red fox / Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) / 5 May 2022 / positive

[This is the 1st report of HPAI in mammals in the United States.

Infections by HPAI viruses in mammals are not common, but foxes have shown to be susceptible to infection by HPAI H5N1 and H5N8, and there have been recent reports of cases in wild red foxes in Europe and Japan. Another canid, the raccoon dog, was also found infected by HPAI H5N1 in Japan. Recently, the same fox species was found infected by HPAI H5N1 in Canada (see ProMED post 20220509.8703152). Virus evolution and adaptive mutations must be closely monitored to rapidly identify viruses with increased potential to infect mammals. - Mod.PMB
