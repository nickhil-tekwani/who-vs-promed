Workers at pork processing plants who developed a rare neurological
disorder 2 years ago [2007] after being exposed to [organic] mist
while removing brains from pigs have improved but still display
symptoms, according to a study by the Mayo Clinic in Rochester,
Minnesota (MN).

The workers at "heads tables" at Quality Pork Processors in Austin,
MN, and at another plant in Indiana had used compressed air to
extract pig brains and developed chronic inflammatory demyelinating
polyneuropathy, which attacks nerves and produces numbness, tingling
and weakness in arms and legs.

An investigation by the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention
found that only 3 USA pork plants used the compressed air process to
remove pig brains: the ones in Indiana and Minnesota and another in
Nebraska. All 3 voluntarily ceased using the process.

The Mayo study found that 16 of 17 of the workers who were treated
with immune therapies such as steroids improved with the treatment,
12 markedly so, according to a report that has been prepared for a
neurology meeting next month [April 2009]; 6 workers who had no
treatment also improved after they were no longer exposed to the pig
brain mist, according to the report.

[Although the exact antigenic stimulus is not clear, the
pathophysiology appears to be exposure to a neural antigen such as
myelin via inhalation of the "pig brain mist". - Mod.LL]
