USA: viral meningitis shows up at double the normal rate in Utah
----------------------------------------------------------------
The Salt Lake Valley Health Department has confirmed 13 cases of viral
meningitis between 1 and 19 Jul 2005. On average, the Health Department,
which serves all of Salt Lake County, confirms an average of 5 cases during
the same time period. Viral meningitis is not as serious as bacterial
meningitis, which killed an East High School student earlier in 2005.
Meningitis is an inflammation of the lining of the brain that can be caused
by many organisms, including different types of viruses. Midsummer is the
peak season for viral meningitis, said Pam Davenport, spokeswoman for the
Health Department.
[Viral meningitis caused by enteroviruses] is believed to be transmitted
through human contact with water, such as rivers, lakes, and wading pools.
"It is often transmitted through fecal-oral [contact] when you get little
kids in diapers in some of these water recreational places."
The viruses that cause viral meningitis are "very common during the summer
and early fall, and many people are exposed to them," said Dagmar Vitek,
medical officer for the Health Department. "However, most infected persons
either have no symptoms or develop only a cold or rash with low-grade
fever. Only a small portion of infected persons actually develop meningitis."
Viral meningitis is a common -- but rarely serious -- disease. The illness
lasts from 7 to 10 days. Symptoms often include headache, fever,
sensitivity to light, stiff or sore neck, and nausea and vomiting.
Enteroviruses, the commonest cause of viral meningitis, are often spread
through direct contact with respiratory secretions, such as saliva or
mucus, from an infected person, according to Ilene Risk, an epidemiologist
with the Health Department. The virus can also be found in the stool of
infected people. In the summer, the high number of young children in
fountains or wading pools is believed to increase the spread of viral
meningitis, Risk said. It is not as common in chlorinated swimming pools.

[The etiologic agents are predominantly enteroviruses, and less frequently
mumps virus (transmitted by droplets and fomites), herpes simplex virus,
and adenovirus.
Cases of enteroviral infection are commonest in summer months and in the
first 10 years of life. Transmission of infection is predominantly by the
fecal-oral route, or by ingestion of contaminated water, as is in the
outbreak described above. Viral meningitis is likely in any situation where
there is gross contamination of environmental water and domestic water
supplies. There is no vaccine or specific treatment for viral meningitis in
view of the heterogeneity of the causative agent. However, the prognosis
for enteroviral meningitis in particular and viral meningitis in general is
good and recovery is usually complete. - Mod.CP]
