USMEF: Chinese consumers' reaction to H1N1
------------------------------------------
Nearly two-thirds of China's consumers stopped eating pork in the
early stages of the H1N1 influenza outbreak this year [2009], and
more than 1 in 5 consumers in the world's largest pork market still
believe that eating pork can result in catching the flu virus,
according to a survey of 1200 Chinese consumers commissioned last
month [August 2009] by the US Meat Export Federation (USMEF).

Speaking to the Fifth International Meat Secretariat (IMS) World
Conference in Qingdao, China, on Thu 3 Sep 2009, Joel Haggard, senior
vice president Asia-Pacific for USMEF, told the more than 600 global
pork industry executives in attendance that China -- both the world's
largest pork producer and consumer -- may have been more affected by
the H1N1 virus outbreak than previously suspected.

"In the early stages of the outbreak, 64 percent of Chinese consumers
refrained from pork consumption," said Haggard, citing research
conducted 6-10 Aug 2009 by Sinotrace Marketing Research Company of
200 consumers in each of 6 Chinese cities: Beijing, Shanghai,
Chongqing, Guangzhou, Nanjing, and Shenyang.

Even now, months after the initial outbreak, 21.2 percent of those
surveyed still believe that eating pork can lead to catching the H1N1
virus. Despite efforts by the Chinese government to educate consumers
regarding the safety of pork, 54.7 percent of those who fear the
connection between pork and the flu virus say that it is because the
virus has been labelled "swine flu."

"The research suggests that the initial Chinese consumer reaction to
H1N1 was sharp, and that a significant number of consumers may still
associate the virus with pork and hogs," said Haggard.

[The international public and animal health agencies FAO, OIE, and
WHO published in May 2009 a common statement pertaining to pork
safety, which included the following (see ProMED-mail archive no.
20090507.1710):

"Influenza viruses are not known to be transmissible to people
through eating processed pork or other food products derived from pigs.

Heat treatments commonly used in cooking meat (such as 70 deg C/160
deg F core temperature) will readily inactivate any viruses
potentially present in raw meat products.

Pork and pork products, handled in accordance with good hygienic
practices recommended by the WHO, Codex Alimentarius Commission, and
the OIE, will not be a source of infection.

Authorities and consumers should ensure that meat from sick pigs or
pigs found dead are not processed or used for human consumption under
any circumstances." - Mod.AS]
