Australia: Traceback for possible BSE cattle
-------------------------------------------------------
It has been revealed that 20 head of imported cattle which could be
carrying mad cow disease are missing in Australia. But the beef industry
body, Safemeat, believes it's unlikely that the stud cattle imported from
Europe in the late 1980s were ever exposed to BSE. Authorities have traced
all UK and European cattle that were imported before the cut-off date of
1992, and found around 480 animals. Those which have died since have all
tested negative for BSE.
Safemeat spokesperson David Palmer says the industry is as confident as it
can be that the 20 missing cattle are not carrying the disease: "The few
that haven't been traced at this stage, investigations continue. They have
been very successful to date, I'd say less than 20 are missing out of 500,
which has been a great effort, but above all, all those that have been
processed have been proved negative. There's no lineal transmission
suggested. There is a whole-of-life quarantine placed on those that are
currently still alive, and all in all, we think that the program has been
very well handled. There's been some buybacks over the years, but mainly it
is a whole-of-life quarantine remaining on farm."

New case in the Netherlands
-----------------------------------
A new BSE case has been confirmed in the Netherlands in the Province of
Gelderland, near the German border. The cow was born 19 Feb 1992; had
clinical signs, and was found positive after fast test and histopathology.
Other animals at the same farm (25 bovines, 4 sheep, 3 goats) will be
examined and culled.
This is the second clinical case [in the Netherlands this year. The first
was confirmed in January after a random test of fallen stock in December 2000.
Since 1997, 15 cases of BSE have been detected in the Netherlands.

MADRID: The National Reference Laboratory for Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy confirmed on Wednesday a new mad cow disease case in
Navarra, northern Spain, bringing to 39 the total number of cases found in
the country. After symptoms of the disease were detected, the infected
animal was slaughtered and sent to laboratories in Madrid for analysis,
said the local food and agriculture authorities in Navarra. The farm where
the case was identified has 84 cows, all for beef production.

Definition of Terms:
-------------------------
BSE and other prion diseases -- really infections?
I´m fully aware that I might be heavily attacked for my comments.
Nevertheless I think it´s worth initiating a discussion of whether or not
prion diseases fulfill the definition of infections, i.e., invasion of /
incorporation into a host followed by subsequent MULTIPLICATION.
Maybe researchers in the field have already abandoned this hypothesis, but
it´s a fact that in every posting we find the word "infection" used to
explain prion diseases, despite the fact that no nucleic acids (neither DNA
nor RNA) could be found; that the "agent" "survives" usual methods of
disinfection and temperatures up to 600 degrees C; and the main
morphological finding is a just a change of the helix structure of a common
protein in the brain (PrP) or neural tissue. If we injected an aspirate of
thyroid tissue containing radioactive iodide into the thyroid gland of
another person, this could lead to thyroid carcinoma -- nobody would call
it infection.
To change "infection" to "induction" is more than just a matter of
semantics. It might change public behaviour and our approach to the science.

[Over the past few years I myself can recall a number of similar
statements, which are, of course, correct. BSE is not an infectious
disease. It seems equally difficult to stop people from using 'infectious'
terminology in regard to it. - Mod.MHJ
