SALMONELLA INFECTIONS - UK (Scotland) (02)
******************************************
Date: Fri, 04 Jul 1997 22:27:11 -0400
From: Robert A. LaBudde <ral@lcfltd.com>
Excerpted from FSNET (D. Powell, Univ. Guelph):
The number of people believed to have become ill during this food-borne
outbreak has more than doubled in the last 24 hours with 26 cases of
salmonella confirmed and another 33 suspected. It is also reported that a
fourth person suffering severe symptoms has been admitted to the Borders
General Hospital, although none are seriously ill and one patient has been
discharged. Dr. Hilary Bowyer, consultant in public health medicine at
Borders Health Board is quoted as saying, "Our control measures were put in
place on Tuesday, and as we reach the end of the four day incubation period,
we can now reasonably expect the outbreak to tail off over the weekend."
