ConAgra Set to Recall 18 Million lbs Beef
-------------------------------------
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - ConAgra Foods Inc , one of the nation's
largest food makers, was expected to expand a recall of ground beef by 18
million pounds due to potential contamination with a deadly
bacteria,Agriculture Department sources said on Friday.
ConAgra on 30 June 2002 voluntarily recalled 354 200 pounds of hamburgers
from its Greeley, Colorado plant because of an outbreak of _E.coli_ 0157:H7
that sickened at least 18 people. _E. coli_ O157:H7 can cause bloody
diarrhea, dehydration and kidney damage. Children and the elderly are the
most at risk. A ConAgra spokesman declined to comment on another recall,
saying only that the company has had talks with the USDA over the past week
about its Colorado plant. However, a USDA source said the company would
pull another 18 million pounds of its ground beef off the market. An
official announcement was expected later on Friday, 19 July 2002.
USDA sent an investigative team to the Colorado plant after the first
recall. A company spokesman said the Omaha, Nebraska-based company has held
discussions with the USDA for about a week regarding its Greeley, Colorado,
beef-processing plant. ConAgra voluntarily recalled about 354 000 pounds of
hamburgers from that plant on 30 June 2002 due to an _E.coli_ outbreak.
"We can confirm that we are in discussions with the USDA and we've been
working closely with them over the past week, reviewing protocol with our
plant in Greeley, Colorado, and reviewing our records," said the
spokesman,Jim Herlihy.
The largest U.S. food recall for _E.coli_ 0157:H7 contamination was in the
summer of 1997 when Hudson Foods withdrew about 35 million pounds of ground
beef after 15 people in Colorado fell ill, according to the USDA. [see
also: ProMED-mail postings from 1997 below - Mod.MPP]. Hudson was purchased
by poultry giant Tyson Foods Inc. one year later. News of an expanded meat
recall was expected to shake up the U.S. cattle market, which has seen
soaring supplies in recent months. Beef supplies are growing on a
combination of slumping export demand and a drought in Plains states that
has destroyed grazing lands and forced ranchers to slaughter their livestock.
The USDA has been scrambling to recover from criticism over how it handled
the first ConAgra recall last month. The department's Food Safety and
Inspection Service admitted that it waited 10 days after federal meat
inspectors first detected the _E. coli_ bacteria in a ConAgra sample before
notifying the company.
The USDA said this week it revised its food safety policy. Federal meat
inspectors will immediately alert a beef company when its sample tests
positive for _E.coli_, instead of waiting until an investigation is complete.
In the earlier ConAgra recall, USDA tests confirmed the bacteria's presence
on 19 June 2002, but the company was not notified until after an
investigation was completed on 29 June 2002. ConAgra announced its first
recall the following day.

Three more illnesses in South Dakota, 1 in Iowa linked to E. coli-tainted beef
----------------------------------------------------------
Four more illnesses have been attributed to E. coli-tainted beef from the
ConAgra plant in Greeley. Health officials in South Dakota confirmed
Thursday that 3 more cases have been linked to the _E. coli_ outbreak in
Colorado, bringing the number to 4 in South Dakota.
Barb Buhler, spokeswoman for the South Dakota Department of Health, said
the 4 patients have recovered from their illnesses and "are doing fine."
In Iowa, epidemiologists also confirmed an illness was matched to the same
_E. coli_ fingerprint. Cort Lohff, assistant epidemiologist for the Iowa
Department of Public Health, said the test results likely mean the patient
ate contaminated beef from ConAgra.
"We haven't interviewed the patient to see whether he visited
Colorado," Lohff said.
One illness in Birmingham, Ala., has been determined to be related to
_E.coli_, but it is not yet known whether it is linked to the ConAgra beef.
Wyoming health officials are investigating one confirmed case of _E. coli_.
Preliminary tests link it to the contaminated beef from Colorado, and the
time frame of the illness is consistent with the outbreak.
"It would have to be quite a coincidence (if it isn't)," said Ross Doman,
spokesman for the Wyoming health department. "But we're going to be opening
the investigation again."

[As mentioned above, the original recall (dated 30 Jun 2002 and posted
at <http://www.fsis.usda.gov/OA/recalls/prelease/pr055-2002.htm> was for
a total of 354 000 pounds of ground beef produced at the Colorado plant,
and distributed to retail, food service and institutional establishments
nationwide. The problem was discovered through FSIS (Food Safety and
Inspection Service of the USDA) microbiological traceback sampling
(traceback sampling refers to finding the origin of contaminated product
found in retail establishments). If this recall is expanded to 18 million
pounds it will be one of the largest meat product recalls to have occurred.
