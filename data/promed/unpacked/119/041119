Situation update
----------------
As of 6 Apr 2013, 24 Nipah cases were identified of which 21 died (mortality rate 88 per cent). These cases were from 13 different districts (Gaibandha, Jhinaidaha, Kurigram, Kushtia, Magura, Manikgonj, Mymenshingh, Naogaon, Natore, Nilphamari, Pabna, Rajbari, Rajshahi). The age distribution of cases was from 8 months to 60 years. [15 cases are male and 9 are females]

Nipah
-----
Human Nipah virus (NiV) infection, an emerging zoonotic disease, was first recognized in a large outbreak of 276 reported cases in Malaysia and Singapore from September 1998 through May 1999.

Agent
-----
NiV is a highly pathogenic paramyxovirus belonging to genus _Henipavirus_. It is an enveloped RNA virus.

Incubation period
-----------------
The median incubation period of the secondary cases who had a single exposure to a Nipah case was 9 days (range 6-11 days) but exposure to onset of illness varies from 6-16 days. The median incubation period following a single intake of raw date palm sap to onset of illness is 7 days (range: 2-12 days) in Bangladesh.

Transmission
------------
- Drinking of raw date palm sap (kancha khejurer rosh) contaminated with NiV.
- Close physical contact with Nipah infected patients.

Surveillance
------------
Nipah surveillance began in 2006, Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) in collaboration with ICDDR,B [International Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh] established Nipah surveillance in 10 District level Government hospitals of the country where Nipah outbreaks had been identified. Presently surveillance system is functioning in 5 hospitals of the Nipah Belt.

A description of Nipah patients in 2013 [is presented in a table that can be seen at the source URL above, along with a map showing the geographic location of the infected individuals].

[This update provides a good overview of the cases of Nipah virus this year (2013) in Bangladesh. Curiously, no mention is made of the reservoir host of the virus, _Pteropus_ fruit bats, that contaminate date palm sap that is consumed by local people.
