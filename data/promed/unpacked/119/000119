Restrictive measures were introduced in Krasnobakovsky district in Nizhni Novgorod region to eliminate the epizootic centre of the virus visna-maedi in sheep, the management of Rosselkhoznadzor for the Nizhny Novgorod region and the Republic of Mari El stated on Monday [25 Mar 2013].

"The disease visna-maedi has been registered in the territory of the Nizhny Novgorod region for the 1st time. This area is a farm, "Usta," with 71 sheep; 7 sheep have fallen ill. They were isolated from the rest of the herd.

Restrictions have been imposed from 18 Mar 2013 until further notice. Any regrouping of animals without the consent of the state veterinary service, any movement of sheep from affected areas (except for the export of animals for the meat processing plant), any sharing of content, and any grazing of infected and/or sick animals with the rest of the livestock/sheep are prohibited during the period of restrictive measures in affected areas.

Access by persons not associated with the treatment of animals on the farm "Usta" is also prohibited, as is the export of fodder, grain, straw, animal feed, and any other things to which infected animals had access."

[According to Merck: http://www.merckmanuals.com/vet/respiratory_system/respiratory_diseases_of_sheep_and_goats/progressive_pneumonia_in_sheep_and_goats.html#v3294702:

Ovine progressive pneumonia and maedi-visna are chronic diseases of sheep caused by lentiviruses (family Retroviridae) that are structurally and antigenically similar. Progressive pneumonia virus and maedi (meaning "dyspnea") virus induce chronic progressive pneumonias that present with similar clinical signs. Visna (meaning "wasting") is the term used in many parts of the world to refer to the neurologic form of the disease in sheep, resulting in paresis and paralysis. A closely related lentivirus-induced disease in goats, caprine arthritis and encephalitis (CAE, see caprine arthritis and encephalitis), affects the nervous system and joints. Reported seroprevalence for lentiviral infection in sheep varies widely, ranging from 49 percent in the western USA to 9 percent in the north Atlantic region. This variation has been reported in other countries as well and may result from varied climatic conditions (arid vs. more lush climates) and management (range conditions vs. close confinement). Finnish breeds may have a greater tendency to become infected than other sheep breeds.

The causal lentivirus, which persists in lymphocytes, monocytes, and macrophages of infected sheep in the presence of a humoral and cell-mediated immune response, can be detected by several serologic tests. Sero-positive sheep and goats must be considered infected and capable of transmitting the virus. Transmission occurs most commonly via the oral route, usually by ingestion of colostrum or milk that contains virus, or by inhalation of infected aerosol droplets. Intrauterine infection is thought to occur infrequently. All breeds of sheep and goats appear susceptible; however, some resistance to lentivirus infection may exist within breeds. Management practices can influence morbidity rates.

Currently, there is no practical, effective treatment, and no vaccines are available. Therefore, the only means for control and prevention is serologic testing and removal of positive animals. Because of the long incubation period and time to seroconversion, retesting animals once a year, or even twice a year, is recommended. In addition to the test and cull approach, consideration should be given to raising neonates in isolation from their dams, especially if the dam is seropositive. Lambs should be fed colostrum from seronegative sheep, or heat-treated sheep colostrum, and raised on milk replacer, milk from seronegative ewes, or heat-treated sheep milk." - Mod.MHJ
