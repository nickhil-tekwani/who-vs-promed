Since January 2006 diarrhoea in Botswana has claimed the lives of 446
babies. Botswana is struggling to contain the disease and is currently
getting assistance and expertise from South Africa, the Centers for Disease
Control in the U.S., the World Health Organisation and other international
health organisations. Over 11 000 children have already been affected by
the disease.
According to Sheila Tlou, Botswana's health minister, investigations have
suggested that water in various parts of Botswana is contaminated. A
parasite called cryptosporidium is the main cause of the disease. The
department of water affairs, the water utilities and the district councils
have stepped up water quality monitoring so as to curb the outbreak. The
ministry of health has also started a public education programme on the
disease in an effort to stop the disease from escalating further.
Education campaign
-------------
Tlou says the intensive community mobilisation and education campaign is
about good sanitation and hygiene practices, proper infant feeding, as well
as proper handling of storage water. Parents and guardians have been asked
to look out for signs of the disease which include frequent watery stools,
vomiting and dehydration. Several public health practitioners and
clinicians have also been sent to areas that are hardest hit as
reinforcements. The ministry of health says many children are dying due to
the parents' delay to seek medical treatment for their sick children. Most
of the children who die are enrolled in the prevention of mother-to-child
transmission programme and are being bottle-fed against the ministry's
advice that they should be fed by the cup.

[In our comment to the first report from the 4 Mar 2006, we stated that
"The present outbreak may be caused by cryptosporidium, but it is important
to exclude other sources." The present report does not contain any
information on other potential causes of diarrhoea like enterovirus or
Salmonella. It is correct that Cryptosporidium can cause large outbreaks,
but only when there is a common water source. A large proportion of
Botswana's drinking water comes from drilled wells, tapping water sources
deep underground, which is in general believed to be clean and safe. We do
not know if the present outbreak includes only populations using surface
water or also those using water from bore-holes. Further information on the
investigation of the etiology and the spatial distribution of cases would
be appreciated. - Mod.EP]
