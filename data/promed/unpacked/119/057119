[1] Ebola alert and airport screening

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) urged clinicians to consider Ebola and other viral hemorrhagic fever illness in the workup of people who have symptoms of the diseases and to immediately take a travel history with an eye toward identifying those who have been in parts of Uganda affected by the recent Ebola Sudan outbreak.

In a Health Alert Network (HAN) notice, the CDC said no suspected, probable, or confirmed cases have been reported in the United States. It said Uganda's outbreak is limited to 5 districts in the central part of the country, with none confirmed from Kampala or the travel hub city of Entebbe. The CDC added that there are no direct flights to the United States from Uganda, but travelers from or passing through affected parts of Uganda can enter the United States on flights from other countries.

Early consideration of Ebola is important for providing prompt patient care and preventing virus spread, the CDC said. On Twitter today [6 Oct 2022], Rochelle Walensky, MD, MPH, said CDC staff are on the ground in Uganda supporting the outbreak response.

The CDC said the outbreak is occurring in the same location as Uganda's last outbreak involving the Sudan strain in 2012. So far, 44 lab-confirmed cases have been reported. The number of deaths in confirmed patients is 10. There are 18 probable cases, based on earlier reports, and 20 probable deaths.

Also, the US government today [6 Oct 2022] announced that all US-bound passengers who have been in Uganda during the past 21 days will need to be routed through one of 5 airports for enhanced screening. The locations are Newark, Atlanta, Chicago, or Washington, DC [and JFK airport in New York]. In a statement, the US Embassy in Uganda said government was taking the step out of an abundance of caution and that the domestic risk is low. In the early days of the COVID pandemic, the government took similar steps to funnel people from high-risk country to certain airports for enhanced screening.

[The summary from the 6 Oct 2022 CDC Health Alert Network notice follows; the full alert can be found at the URL below:

"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is issuing this Health Alert Network (HAN) Health Advisory about a recently confirmed outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Uganda caused by Sudan virus (species _Sudan ebolavirus_) to summarize CDC's recommendations for US public health departments and clinicians, case identification and testing, and clinical laboratory biosafety considerations. No suspected, probable, or confirmed EVD cases related to this outbreak have yet been reported in the United States. However, as a precaution and to remind clinicians about best practices, CDC is communicating with public health departments, public health laboratories, and healthcare workers in the United States to raise awareness of this outbreak" (https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2022/han00477.asp).

Dr. Walensky's 6 Oct 2022 retweet from US Mission Uganda: "Working closely w/ @MinofHealthUG, @WHO & other partners, a team of @CDC staff from Uganda + USA are in Mubende providing support in the areas of surveillance, epidemiology, lab, communications & ecological investigations in the response to the Sudan #Ebola Virus. #EbolaOutbreakUG" (https://twitter.com/CDCDirector/status/1578045977629532160).

[2] Rerouting passengers from Uganda

The US State Department has begun "enhanced screening" of airline passengers traveling from Uganda amid a rapidly spreading Ebola outbreak in the small east African nation.

The federal directive that became effective Friday morning [7 Oct 2022] means any traveler who has been to Uganda in the past 21 days will be redirected to one of 5 designated airports -- most of them along the Eastern seaboard -- to be screened for the virus.

A health alert issued by the US Embassy in Uganda said the hubs will include John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey, Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta, Washington Dulles International Airport, and Chicago O'Hare International Airport.

US citizens will also be subject to the new rules, which disease experts believe might discourage sick Ugandans from traveling across the Atlantic, knowing they would be stopped at the border. Passengers who pass the screenings will be allowed to continue to their respective destinations.

The Biden administration has reenacted measures that were taken in recent years to check people for viral symptoms as they arrived from affected areas around the world.

In this latest outbreak, no Ebola cases have been reported outside Uganda, where about 145 people catch a flight to the United States each day, according to federal figures.

In 2014, the US government conducted Ebola screenings that identified 7 travelers who arrived in the country with possible symptoms. Although none were initially found to have the virus, one man did go on to develop symptoms and later tested positive.

Last year [2021] the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) rerouted airline passengers from Guinea and the Democratic Republic of Congo to collect information that would serve to track them down in the event of an outbreak.

Ebola is an insidious virus that causes severe fever, chills and other symptoms like bleeding, vomiting and diarrhea. The virus spreads through touching, kissing or sharing contaminated items, and causes death in at least 50% of cases. A person could have the virus for as long as 3 weeks before any symptoms appear, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

The CDC has also urged doctors nationwide to screen their own patients for the virus if any had recently traveled to Africa. The nation's foremost public health agency said it was taking the steps only "as a precaution," adding that the virus -- at least for now -- posed very little threat to the population.

Meanwhile, at least 36 deaths have been confirmed in Uganda since the outbreak began on 20 Sep 2022, while health officials have identified more than 60 cases across the country, the WHO said.

This week, the US Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR) announced USD 110 million for the development of a vaccine to treat another Ebola strain known as Sudan virus. "If approved this treatment will put the United States in a better position to prepare for and respond to future potential ebolavirus incidents," ASPR assistant secretary Dawn O'Connell said in a statement, according to CBS News. "Given the current outbreak of Ebola Sudan in Uganda, this work is now even more important."

Made by Johnson & Johnson and overseen by the National Institutes of Health, the vaccine has not yet been tested for its effectiveness against Ebola [Sudan].

[3] Uganda: case summary, vaccine

"So far, 63 confirmed and probable cases have been reported, including 29 deaths," [WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus] told a press conference in Geneva. "Ten health workers have been infected and 4 have died. Four people have recovered and are receiving follow-up care."

The east African nation's Health Minister Jane Ruth Aceng Ocero said that a 58-year-old anaesthetist had died of Ebola early Wednesday [5 Oct 2022]. "The late [MN] is the 4th health worker we have lost in the current Ebola outbreak," the minister said on Twitter, following the deaths of a Tanzanian doctor, a health assistant and a midwife.

Tedros said: "When there is a delay in detecting an Ebola outbreak, it's normal for cases to increase steadily at the beginning and then decrease as life-saving interventions and outbreak control measures are implemented." But he added: "The vaccines used successfully to curb recent Ebola outbreaks in the DRC are not effective against the type of Ebola virus that's responsible for this outbreak in Uganda.

"However, several vaccines are in various stages of development against this virus, 2 of which could begin clinical trials in Uganda in the coming weeks, pending regulatory and ethics approvals from the Ugandan government." Tedros said the WHO was supporting the Ugandan government in its response to the outbreak, which has been reported in 4 districts. Since the initial outbreak was discovered in the central district of Mubende, infections have been found in Kassanda, Kyegegwa and Kagadi.

The UN's health agency has released USD 2 million from its contingency fund for emergencies and is working with partners to support the health ministry by sending additional specialists, supplies and resources, Tedros said.

Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has vowed not to impose any lockdowns to tackle the disease, saying last week that there was "no need for anxiety." Uganda had confirmed 10 deaths, with Museveni specifying that 19 other probable Ebola cases had also died, but said they were buried before they could be tested for infection.
