[This is the 1st time that ProMED has reported chikungunya virus infections in Goa. However, occurrence of Goa cases is not surprising because the mosquito vector of both dengue and chikungunya viruses is present there. Dengue cases in Goa were reported in 2009 (see ProMED-mail archive no 20090921.3322). In 2010, chikungunya virus infections were widely reported in India, in Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, and Orissa states.
