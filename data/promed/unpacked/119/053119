A woman who recently returned to Florida from Haiti has been
diagnosed with cholera, the Florida Department of Health announced Wed
16 Nov 2010. "We are working with our health care partners to ensure
appropriate care of this individual and prevent the spread of this
disease within the community," said State Surgeon General Ana M.
Viamonte Ros in a written statement. She said Florida authorities will
"continue to monitor the state for any future cases."

A recent cholera outbreak in Haiti has left more than 1100 people
dead and has now spread across the border to the Dominican Republic.
That nation has issued a maximum health alert, its health ministry
said.

The number of US travelers heading to and from Haiti has increased
since the Haitian earthquake in January 2010, according to the
statement.

Florida's Department of Health said the superior USA infrastructure
minimizes the risk for fecal contamination of food and water, limiting
the potential for the spread of the disease. Person-to-person
transmission is also rare, it added.

[Certainly, the introduction of cholera into the USA, given the
availability of adequate sanitation and clean water, would not readily
cause any substantial outbreak. More USA [imported] cases are
expected, and it is also likely that cases may occur in citizens of
other nations providing human support. - Mod.LL]
