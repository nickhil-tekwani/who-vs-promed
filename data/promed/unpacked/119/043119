Animal rabies, Denmark - Bat virus causes rabies in sheep
On 24 August, rabies was diagnosed by the Danish Veterinary Institute for
Virus Research in a sheep in western Jutland. Further characterization of
the isolated virus strain performed by the Central Veterinary Laboratory
(United Kingdom) revealed that it was bat rabies virus type EBL-1a, which
is identical to the bat rabies virus isolated sporadically from Danish
bats. No animal may leave the holding in which the case occurred without a
permit from the Danish Veterinary Service. No other animal has shown any
clinical signs of rabies.
[WER Editorial note: In western Europe, there are 2 distinct rabies
reservoirs, in which the virus is maintained by permanent transmission: one
comprises terrestrial wildlife species (mainly foxes), and the other bats.
Infection of other susceptible species (including humans) is an
epidemiological dead-end, as the virus is usually not further propagated.
No outbreaks of bat rabies in wildlife have been detected. This is the
first case of rabies in a terrestrial animal caused by a bat-related rabies
virus.
