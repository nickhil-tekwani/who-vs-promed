[Confirmation, and -- if affirmative -- details, including exact
location, species involved, and particularly FMDV serotype
implicated, are urgently needed.
Russia's last notification of FMD within its borders was sent on 25
Jan 2006 (see 20060130.0289). It referred to an outbreak of serotype
Asia 1 in a village on the border between Russia's East Siberian
province (oblast) Chitinskaya and China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region (map at
<http://map.rin.ru/cgi-bin/main_e.pl?Region=chitin>). - Mod.AS]
