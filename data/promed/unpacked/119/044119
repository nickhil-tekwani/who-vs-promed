Viet Nam on Tuesday [8 Nov 2005] confirmed its 42nd human death from
bird flu, its first in more than 3 months, a Health Ministry official
said. The 35-year-old man, who died on 29 Oct 2005, was admitted to a
Hanoi hospital 4 days after his family bought a prepared chicken from
a market near his house in the Dong Da District of Hanoi, said Nguyen
Van Binh, deputy director of the Preventive Medicine Department under
the Ministry of Health. Other family members did not show any
symptoms of bird flu, he said.
Viet Nam has ordered 25 million tablets of the antiviral drug Tamiflu
from Swiss-based Roche Holding AG, Tuesday's Tuoi Tre (Youth)
newspaper reported. Tamiflu is one of the few drugs that is believed
to be effective against bird flu. The newspaper quoted Cao Minh
Quang, director of the pharmaceutical administration department under
the Ministry of Health, as saying talks with the company on a
possible license for Vietnam to produce a generic version of the drug
were still inconclusive.
In China, authorities warned Tuesday that fake bird flu vaccines for
poultry were threatening public health and said an unapproved product
was being sold in northern Liaoning province, the site of a recent
outbreak. "This fake medicine could result in serious consequences,"
Jia Youling, chief veterinary officer of the Ministry of Agriculture,
said in a television interview. "It could cause very serious harm to
both people and poultry."
China suffers from rampant and sometimes dangerous product piracy.
Bogus medicines that have none of the declared ingredients on the
packaging are common. China has reported 4 bird flu outbreaks in the
past 4 weeks, resulting in the culling and vaccination of tens of
millions of birds, though no human cases have been confirmed.

Nguoi Lao Dong newspaper reported Tue 8 Nov 2005 a suspected human
infection case of avian influenza in the central city of Hue. A
68-year-old man died in Hue Central Hospital on 6 Nov 2004, but had
not shown typical bird flu symptoms, the paper said, adding specimens
had been sent to the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology.
A woman hospitalized in the northern Bac Giang province, who had
previously tested negative for H5N1, had fever again, Tuoi Tre said.
Vietnam confirmed its 42nd human avian influenza death yesterday [7
Nov 2005], and the government admitted bird flu outbreaks had struck
Vietnam on a "larger scale" this year than in 2004.

An Indonesian girl who died on Tuesday [8 Nov 2005] is suspected to
have been the country's 6th avian influenza victim, but a hospital
spokesman said officials are waiting for local test results. The
latest death, if confirmed by further testing, would bring to 10 the
number of human cases in the world's 4th most populous nation. 5
Indonesians are confirmed to have died.
The 16-year-old girl was admitted to a Jakarta hospital on Sunday [6
Nov 2005] suffering from high fever and heavy pneumonia and died on
Tuesday morning [8 Nov 2005]. She lived in an East Jakarta suburb
near a bird market but no evidence of direct contact with infected
fowl has yet been established.
"Based on the clinical symptoms, it looks like bird flu," said Ilham
Patu, spokesman for Jakarta's Sulianti Saroso hospital "We have taken
samples and the test result should be available in the next 2-3
days." Local testing is usually followed by analysis at a Hong Kong
laboratory recognised by the World Health Organization.
Over the weekend, officials had confirmed another Indonesian woman,
who died in October 2005, had been a bird flu victim. Her brother,
whom an official had earlier identified as her nephew, also tested
positive for H5N1 virus strain, but is in relatively good condition.
A case involving a nurse with bird flu-like symptoms was still under
investigation but an initial local test was negative.
Bird flu first surfaced among Indonesia's fowl in late 2003, and has
been found in 23 out of its 33 provinces, killing more than 10
million domesticated birds. Officials say new infections in fowl in
2005 are so far around 800 000, compared with 5.3 million for all of
2004. But the U.N Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) warns
Indonesia needs to be prepared and to revitalise public awareness
because the flu most easily spreads among both poultry and humans in
the rainy season that usually runs from October to February.
After intense bird flu activity earlier "everyone thought the problem
was over but in fact it isn't," Peter Roeder, the animal health
officer heading an FAO emergency team, told Reuters. "There is such
urgency about getting started to reinvigorate the process here," he
added.
The FAO is setting up 4 local disease control centres across Java
island and establishing disease surveillance teams at the village
level where many so-called "backyard" chickens are found. The task
force may involve several thousand people.
"Most of the known human infection has occurred in a fairly small
area in the western part of Java. There's obviously something there
which is enabling the disease to transmit to humans more frequently,"
said Roeder. "So it makes sense to try and stop that, because
everything we're doing is, in fact, trying to reduce the risk of
human infection eventually." He said the disease control effort would
likely be extended to other bird flu hotspots within the archipelago
early in 2006.
The H5N1 virus has infected at least 123 people in Asia and killed
more than 60, for a known mortality rate of more than 50 percent.
Viet Nam on Tuesday confirmed its 42nd human death from bird flu. 13
have died in Thailand and 4 in Cambodia. Most cases have been
[attributed to] direct or indirect contact with infected chickens.

[There is some confusion regarding the status of the Indonesian woman
who died in October. Previously it was reported that the woman and
one of her 2 nephews had died after contracting avian influenza, and
her daughter and another nephew remained healthy. Subsequently the
WHO confirmed that the woman and her son (not nephew) were confirmed
avian influenza cases. In the above report the male relative has
"become" her brother. More importantly the nurse, who cared for the
woman and was a 3rd suspected avian influenza case, has now
(provisionally) tested negative, reducing the likelihood of a cluster
of cases due to person-to-person transmission. Further clarification
is awaited. - Mod.CP]
