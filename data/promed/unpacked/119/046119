More than 50 cases of measles, including 2 deaths, in one week were reported by the medical director of the health centre in Bikenge, a mining town 200 km [124 mi] east of Kindu, in Maniema [province]. This disease attacks particularly unvaccinated children zero to 5 years of age, says a doctor. Some of these children are being cared for in the Bikenge Health Centre; others are being treated in private clinics, and some at home.

According to the Medical Director of the Bikenge Health Centre, none of these facilities have resources to accommodate all patients. In order to avoid contamination, sick children should be separated and quarantined to avoid further spread of the disease. Emergency government aid will be required to prevent further fatalities. He also called on parents to ensure their children are vaccinated.

[Radio Okapi bulletins have reported other measles outbreaks in the adjacent Orientale Province recently:
- As many as 100 children died as a result of measles virus infection in Yawuma during a 2 month period;
- 40 people have died since June [2012] in Buta;
- Measles continues to spread in the Tshopo Lomami health district.

It has also been reported that more than 65 000 children are being vaccinated in Ludimbi-Lukula [Kasai-Oriental Province].

On Sunday [30 Dec 2012], 7 more children died of measles in Pakistan's southern province of Sindh, taking the toll due to the disease to 154 in the month, media reports said. Citing the Urdu TV channel Dunya, the Xinhua [news agency] said the disease broke out during the last week of October [2012] in northern areas of Sindh province that had been hit by floods in August and September.

Children between the ages of 2 and 9 years were affected. Health officials said that over 1200 measles-affected children have been admitted to hospitals since November [2012].

They said the major reasons behind such a massive spread of the disease were malnutrition and unhygienic conditions in which the affected children were living. Most of the affected children were living together in congested [accommodation] and were passing the disease to other children, a senior health official was quoted as saying. Families of the affected children said stagnant rain water was still present in their surroundings even after 3 months since the floods hit the province.

The Sindh Health Ministry said an anti-measles vaccination drive has been launched in the affected areas. Around 130 000 children have been vaccinated so far.

This is the 2nd major outbreak of the disease in Sindh this year [2012]. In June, the World Health Organization said that 27 children under 5 years died due to measles in the province.
