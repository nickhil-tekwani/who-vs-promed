Some 800 people, including patients, doctors and visitors, fell ill
Friday [16 Jan 2009] after consuming food in a hospital in Palmas, in
north central Brazil, Brazilian media reported. These people showed
symptoms of poisoning after consuming food on Thursday [15 Jan 2009]
in the General Hospital of Palmas, the main medical center of Tocantins state.

Experts from the Epidemiological and Health Surveillance would
inspect the hospital to find out what caused the poisoning. Meals in
the hospital are prepared by a company contracted by the state's
Department of Health. The same company is also in charge of the
hospital's cleaning.

[More epidemiological information is needed to discern the etiology
of this large institutional outbreak including incubation period and
presence or absence of fever and symptoms. ProMED-mail would
appreciate more information regarding this impressive cluster.

Palmas is the capital of the Brazilian state of Tocantins. Maps of
Brazil showing the location of Palmas in Tocantins and the state of
Tocantins in Brazil can be found at
