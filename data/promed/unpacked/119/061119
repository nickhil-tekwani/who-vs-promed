Emergency report:
Translation of information received on 2 Oct 2003 from Dr Isabelle
Chmitelin, Deputy Director General, General Directorate for Food (DGAL),
Ministry of Agriculture, Food, Fisheries and Rural Affairs, Paris:
Report date: 2 Oct 2003.
Nature of diagnosis: clinical and laboratory.
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 30 Jul 2003.
Date of confirmation of diagnosis: 30 Sep 2003.
Location: Saint-Benoit district, on the East coast of Reunion Island,
Indian Ocean.
No. of outbreaks: 1
Description of affected population: Merino sheep; semi-extensive rearing
system.
Total number of animals in the outbreak:
species/susceptible/cases/deaths/destroyed/slaughtered
ovi / 200 / 57 / 0 / 0 / 0
Diagnosis: approximately 50 animals in the flock presented mild
inflammatory signs on the muzzle and/or lips.
A. Laboratory where diagnosis was made: French Agency for Food Safety
(AFSSA), Maisons-Alfort.
B. Diagnostic tests used: virus isolation; virus neutralisation test; virus
sequencing. The results of these tests showed the presence of the
bluetongue virus in blood samples taken from animals with localised
clinical signs.
C. Causal agent: virus serotyping is in progress.
Epidemiology:
A. Source of agent / origin of infection: investigations are under way.
B. Other epidemiological details:
- The sheep population of Reunion Island is very limited (a total of 2000
animals in 18 flocks). Cattle and goat populations are estimated to 30 000
and 40 000 animals, respectively.
- According to the zoning and regionalisation procedures mentioned in
Chapter 1.3.5. of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code, the French
Authorities believe that the island status of Reunion and its remoteness
from mainland France (12 000 km) allow the Departments of mainland France
to maintain their bluetongue-free status.
Control measures:
- Quarantine of the affected farm.
- Inspections in the farm before slaughter of the sick animals.
- Quarantine zone set up within a 20-km radius around the outbreak, with
identification of the farms with susceptible species and search for
clinical signs.
- Movement restrictions for ruminants, including ban on any shipment from
Reunion Island of live animals -- domestic or wild -- of susceptible
species (bovine, ovine, caprine), as well as of ova, embryos, or semen from
the same species. It should be noted that there have not been any shipments
of this type during the past 3 years.
- Disinfection of the infected farm.
- A clinical and serological monitoring programme for the farms at risk
will be carried out in Reunion so as to determine a control strategy in
accordance with the local epidemiological situation (particular
geographical status of this French Department and limited clinical
expression of the disease).
- The advisability of systematic vaccination of sheep will be studied.
