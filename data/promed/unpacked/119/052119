African trypanosomiasis due to _Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense_ in a
traveller returning from Zambia
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The 49 year old female was camping in Zambia for 15 days. Her
itinerary was as follows:
29 Sep 2010 flew from UK to Malawi; 30 Sep 2010 in Lilongwe (Malawi);
1-3 Oct 2010 in South Luangwa National Park; 4 Oct 2010 in Bridge
Camp (en route to Lower Zambezi); 5-7 Oct 2010 in Lower Zambezi
National Park; 8 Oct 2010 in Lusaka; 9-11 Oct 2010 in Kafue National
Park (north part); 12-14 Oct 2010 in Kafue National Park (south
part); 15 Oct 2010 in Livingstone; 16 Oct 2010 returned to UK.

The patient experienced numerous tsetse fly bites during her trip.
She developed fever and headache on day 10 (13 Oct 2010) and received
empirical treatment for malaria. 5 days later, upon her return to the
UK, she presented with ongoing symptoms and was transferred to the
Tropical and Infectious Diseases Unit at the Royal Liverpool
University Hospital. Trypanosomiasis was diagnosed at the Liverpool
School of Tropical Medicine after examination of a peripheral blood
film, which indicated a high parasitaemia. The patient is currently
receiving a treatment course of suramin with lumbar puncture awaited.

This report follows the communication 1 month ago to ProMED-mail of a
US traveller who similarly developed African trypanosomiasis while on
a hunting safari in the South Luangwa river valley in Zambia [see
ProMED-mail Trypanosomiasis - USA ex Zambia: (EA) 20100915.3338].

As members of the GeoSentinel Surveillance Network we are also
reporting this case to GeoSentinel.

Trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) in a traveller visiting Zimbabwe/Zambia
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Health Protection Agency in England wishes to report a case of
African trypanosomiasis in a traveller who visited Zimbabwe/Zambia
between 29 Aug 2010 and 12 Sep 2010.

The patient presented with fever and confusion; diagnosis was proven
by peripheral blood film showing a heavy parasitaemia. The clinical
and travel history, and degree of parasitaemia are consistent with
_Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense_. The patient is currently being
treated with suramin pending further investigations.

The patient stayed in the Mana Pools National Park in Zimbabwe (which
is close to the Lake Kariba region in Zimbabwe in Mashonaland West,
and on the border with the Southern province of Zambia) from 1-8 Sep
2010 and was reportedly heavily bitten by tsetse flies during this
stay. The patient had also stayed in and around Lusaka in Zambia
during the trip, but tsetse flies were not reported from these
locations.

This travel associated case has been notified to WHO and through them
to the Zimbabwean Public Health Authorities.

Several recent cases of trypanosomiasis have been reported in
travellers to the South Luangwa valley area, which is in the Eastern
province of Zambia.

A 2007 WHO report on human African trypanosomiasis stated that "South
Africa and Great Britain sporadically report cases, generally
tourists visiting the Kariba lake region, along the border between
Zambia and Zimbabwe. A total of 9 cases were reported in 1997; since
then, only in 2004, 4 cases were treated in South Africa coming from
Kariba lake region." (Source:
<http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2007/WHO_CDS_NTD_IDM_2007.6_eng.pdf>).

It is difficult to ascertain whether an increasing number of cases
reflect an increased risk or an increased number of visitors to risk
areas. Our thanks to the individuals reporting these cases. - Mod.EP]
