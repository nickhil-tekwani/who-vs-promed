_Burkholderia cepacia_ bacteremia after cardiac surgery
------------------------------------------------------
On 18 Feb 2005, a 69-year-old man underwent a elective off-pump quadruple
coronary artery bypass grafting, and within 12 hours he developed septic
shock. 2 of 2 blood cultures grew _B. cepacia_. He was fine pre-op without
any evidence of any infection.
During surgery, the patient received Lactated Ringers solution, Hextend (a
plasma volume expander), and normal saline. Blood loss was returned to him
via Cell Saver. Since this incident, there have been no other patients
either with a similar presentation or growing _Burkholderia cepacia_
post-cardiac surgery.
The rapidity of this process suggests an iatrogenic high-inoculum event.
Anyone else have recent cases such as this that would suggest common
vehicle (source)?

[_B. cepacia_ is a nonfermentative, aerobic, Gram-negative bacillus,
formerly classified as _Pseudomonas_. Unlike _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, _B.
cepacia_ is an organism of low virulence with limited ability to cause
infection in humans but can affect certain high-risk groups.
_B. cepacia_ survives and multiplies in aqueous hospital environments,
where it may persist for long periods even in distilled water and in
certain antiseptic solutions, such as quaternary ammonium salts.
In this case, the time after surgery (12 hours) might suggest that the
possible intravenous exposure occurred post-operatively. ProMED would
appreciate hearing about similar episodes. - Mod.LL]
