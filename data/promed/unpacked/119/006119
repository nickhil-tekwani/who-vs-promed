Cargill Meat Solutions, a Wyalusing, Pennsylvania establishment, is recalling 29 339 pounds of fresh ground beef products that may be contaminated with _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Enteritidis, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today, 22 Jul 2012.

The products subject to recall, sold wholesale and for further processing, are:

14 pound packages of "Grnd Beef Fine 85/15," packed 3 to approximately 42-pound cases.

The products subject to recall bear the establishment number "EST. 9400" inside the USDA mark of inspection. While the use-by date has passed, and these products are no longer available for retail sale, FSIS and the company are concerned that some products may be frozen in consumers' freezers. These products were produced on 25 May 2012 and were shipped to distribution centers in Connecticut, Maine, and New York for further distribution.

It is important to note that the above listed products were repackaged into consumer-size packages and sold under different retail brand names. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on FSIS's website at: http://www.fsis.usda.gov/FSIS_Recalls/Open_Federal_Cases/index.asp.

FSIS became aware of the problem during the course of an ongoing investigation of a multi-state outbreak of _S._ Enteritidis involving 33 case-patients from 7 states (MA, ME, NH, NY, RI, VA, VT - preliminary data, subject to change). Working in conjunction with the CDC, Vermont Department of Health, New York State Department of Health and New York State Department of Agriculture & Markets, FSIS was able to link illnesses in 5 case-patients to the ground beef products produced at this establishment based on epidemiologic and traceback investigations, as well as in-store reviews. Illness onset dates among these 5 case-patients ranged from 6 Jun 2012 to 13 Jun 2012. Two of the 5 case-patients were hospitalized.

Leftover products with no packaging information collected during the course of this investigation by the Vermont Department of Health tested positive for _S._ Enteritidis with the outbreak strain. This outbreak strain of _S._ Enteritidis is drug sensitive, meaning antimicrobial agents can be effective in treating patients who need them. FSIS is continuing to work with CDC and public health partners on the investigation.

FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including those fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160 F. The only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature.

[ProMED awaits more information regarding this outbreak. It is likely that repackaged ground beef from the vehicle are still in household freezers. Adequately cooking the meat and practicing good kitchen hygiene are the best ways of preventing this foodborne illness. - Mod.LL
