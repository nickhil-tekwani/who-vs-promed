Background:
Several clinical virology laboratories in New York State have reported receiving tubes of Primary Rhesus Monkey Kidney Cells (RhMK) from a commercial cell supplier, Diagnostic Hybrids of Athens, OH that were contaminated with fungus. The tubes are distributed nationally. NYSDOH is working with CDC, the Ohio Department of Health and Diagnostic Hybrids on this investigation.

While contamination in cell culture tubes is not an unusual event, the morphology of the fungus in at least some of the contaminated RhMK tubes is consistent with _Coccidioides_. Furthermore, testing of material from 2 different lots (directly from tubes in lot A-491216-B, and from fungal cultures grown from lot A-491206-T) with a _Coccidioides_ genus-specific real-time PCR assay has yielded positive results. Additional molecular testing will be performed next week to confirm and speciate for _Coccidioides immitis_ and/or _Coccidioides posadasii_. Both are human pathogens.

Tubes appeared normal on the day of arrival with no color change in the media. However, fungal growth was observed within 24 hours to a few days in variable numbers of tubes, including those that had never been opened. Contaminated tubes have included the appearance of a "white slimy mass;" additionally, paper/cotton fibers, and glass and dust particles have been seen microscopically.

Epidemiology/Clinical features of _Coccidiodes_:
_Coccidioides_ is a fungus that exists in the soil of endemic areas, which include the southwestern USA. The fungus exists in the environment as arthroconidia, which are the infectious propagules. Nearly any mammal can be infected by inhalation of arthroconidia. Following infection in human tissue, the fungus transforms to a spherule phase, which is not infectious. Development of arthroconidia may occur following incubation at room temperature.

Symptoms generally appear between 1-4 weeks after exposure. Symptomatic infections usually present as flu-like illness with fever, cough, headaches, rash, and myalgias [often called "Valley fever". - Mod.LM]. Some patients fail to recover and develop chronic pulmonary infection or widespread disseminated infection (affecting meninges, soft tissues, joints, and bone). Severe disease may develop in anyone, but HIV-infected people or other immunocompromised patients, people receiving corticosteroids, pregnant women in their 3rd trimester, and people of African, Asian, or Filipino descent are at increased risk for developing disseminated disease. In people who develop progressive, chronic or disseminated disease, symptoms may persist for months or even longer. Meningitis may lead to permanent neurologic damage. Mortality is highest in HIV-infected people with diffuse lung disease.

Diagnosis and Treatment:
Serologic testing is sometimes helpful to determine exposure and disease severity. Fungal cultures can also be performed for confirmation and speciation, and histological analysis. Oral azoles, including fluconazole at a dosage of 400 mg daily, are a popular 1st-line therapy, although treatment for primary disease remains controversial. Fluconazole has been shown to be the treatment of choice for treating coccidioidal meningitis. For the management of severely ill patients, amphotericin B and posaconazole are commonly used.

Recommendation for Laboratories:
Laboratories should immediately stop using tubes of Primary Rhesus Monkey Kidney Cells (RhMK) from implicated lots (A-491216-B and A-491206-T) and investigate whether there have been any potential exposures at their facility. If tubes were handled in a manner in accordance with recognized biosafety procedures, the risk of exposure to workers is currently expected to be low. A potential exposure is one where inhalation of arthroconidia may have occurred, particularly if tubes were opened or manipulated outside of a biological safety cabinet.

Until more information is available in the next few days, and in consultation with CDC, laboratories should quarantine and safely store tubes from these lots in an appropriate refrigerator. Tubes should be clearly labeled to avoid accidental use. Additional guidance on appropriate disposition of unused tubes will be forthcoming. If disposal of tubes is necessary, all tubes should be autoclaved prior to disposal. Information about potential contamination of other lots is not presently available. As such, laboratories are strongly urged to ensure strict adherence to biosafety protocols.

At present, CDC does not have guidelines for responding to _Coccidioides_ exposure in a laboratory, as each exposure should be considered individually. Laboratories in New York State should contact the Bureau of Communicable Disease Control (BCDC) at <bcdc@health.state.ny.us> to report receipt of RhMK tubes from Diagnostic Hybrids as soon as possible. Potential exposures should be reported to BCDC at 518-473-4439 during business hours or 1-866-881-2809 on evenings, weekends and holidays. Laboratories outside of New York State should contact their State Health Department, which should in turn contact Anne Purfield at CDC at <aip4@cdc.gov> or 404-639-2359. Potentially exposed workers should also be advised to contact their primary care physician if they develop any symptoms of _Coccidioides_ infection and notify them of their potential exposure.

If you have any questions regarding this information, please contact the NYSDOH Bureau of Communicable Disease Control at <bcdc@health.state.ny.us> or (518) 473-4439.

[How these cultures became contaminated is a fine epidemiological puzzle. Ohio is outside the _Coccidioides_ belt of the USA, and the fungus is not found outside the Americas and so would not have been imported if any of the rhesus monkeys used had been imported from Asia. But if they were bred in outdoor pens in a _Coccidioides_ endemic region of the USA or Mexico, they could have been contaminated there. The cell cultures are unlikely to have been contaminated during production by an infected laboratory worker. - Mod.JW]

[The risk of aerosolization of the arthrospores would be less in this tissue culture contamination (a liquid medium) than if the mold was growing on a solid medium. Dr. Woodall's comments above are all quite correct. The source of the contamination is a mystery. - Mod.LL
