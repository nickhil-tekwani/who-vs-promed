Sofina Foods Inc. is recalling Janes brand Pub Style Chicken Burgers from the marketplace because of a risk of possible _Salmonella_ contamination. According to the recall notice posted on the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) website, the recall was triggered by CFIA findings during its investigation into a foodborne illness outbreak.

"The CFIA is conducting a food safety investigation, which may lead to the recall of other products. If other high-risk products are recalled, the CFIA will notify the public through updated Food Recall Warnings," the agency statement said. The CFIA said it is verifying that industry is removing recalled product from the marketplace, and specified the type of burgers as "Uncooked Breaded Chicken Burgers".

Consumers can identify the recalled product by the following information:

Brand Name / Common Name / Size / Code(s) on Product / UPC
Janes Pub Style Chicken Burgers / Uncooked Breaded Chicken Burgers / 800 g / Outer package: 2019 MA 14 / Inner package: 1348M 0 69299 12491 0

According to the recall notice, Sofina Foods Inc. distributed the Pub Style Chicken Burgers nationwide to a number of retailers.

Consumers should not consume these products, Sofina Foods Inc. warned. Affected products should be discarded or may be returned to the place of purchase. Consumers with questions can call 1-855-763-4621.

Advice to consumers
-------------------
Anyone who has eaten any of the recalled products and developed symptoms of _Salmonella_ infection should seek medical attention and tell their doctors about the possible exposure to the bacteria.

Anyone can become sick with a _Salmonella_ infection, but infants, children, seniors and those with weakened immune systems are at higher risk of serious illness because their immune systems are more fragile, according to the state health agency.

Most people who become ill from a _Salmonella_ infection will recover fully after a few days. It is possible for some people to be infected with the bacteria and not get sick or show any symptoms, but still be able to spread the infection to others.

Symptoms of a _Salmonella_ infection, called salmonellosis, typically start 6 to 72 hours after exposure to _Salmonella_ bacteria, but in some people, it takes 2 weeks for symptoms to develop. Symptoms include fever, chills, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, headache, nausea, and vomiting. These symptoms usually last for 4 to 7 days.
