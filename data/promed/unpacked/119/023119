Tick borne encephalitis contracted by consumption of goat milk
--------------------------------------------------------------
The Kaliningrad regional division of Rospotrebnadzor [Federal service
on customers' rights protection and human well-being surveillance] has
described a case of an 8-year-old child who contracted tick-borne
encephalitis (TBE) after consumption of raw goat milk.

Raw goat milk is an established source of TBE infection during the
epidemic season, the report says. Goat milk is being preferentially
given to children since it is less allergenic.

Rospotrebnadzor strongly recommends boiling the milk before
consumption. There were 2 similar cases in the region in 2009 and 6
cases in 2010.
