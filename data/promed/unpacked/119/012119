In Kyzylorda [Qyzylorda] Region of Kazakhstan, a 4-year girl has been hospitalized with a diagnosis of rabies virus infection. The girl lived in a village near Talsuat according to the press service of the Ministry of Emergency Situations of Kazakhstan.

The girl, born in 2009, was admitted to the infectious diseases ward of the regional hospital at 18:15 on 5 May 2013. Relatives reported that she had been bitten by a dog. The unusual behaviour of the dog (a domestic pet) alarmed them and caused them to seek medial attention. Their worst fears were fulfilled when a diagnosis of rabies was confirmed on 8 May 2013 at 9.00 am.

At present, the child is in serious condition, and counter-measures[?] are being taken.

[Qyzylorda (or Kyzylorda) is a province of Kazakhstan. Its capital is the city Kyzylorda, with a population of 157 400. The province itself has a population of 590 000. It includes the Russian-administered Baikonur, which services the Baikonur Cosmodrome. The province borders the neighboring country of Uzbekistan, as well as 3 other provinces: Aktobe Province (to the west), Karagandy Province (to the north) and South Kazakhstan Province (to the east). The Syr Darya River, flowing from the Tian Shan mountains to the Aral Sea, passes through Kyzylorda Province. The province's location can be viewed at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyzylorda_Province. - Mod.CP]

[Kazakhstan has reported 39 cases of human rabies during the preceding 5 years of which 30 were located in the south of the country. - Mod.NP]

[It is unclear from the wording of the above report if the child was admitted to the hospital in response to severe dog bites or if the child was admitted to the hospital in response to the onset of symptoms consistent with rabies virus infection. If the latter, the incubation period provided in the newswire (3-4 days from dog bite to confirmation of rabies infection in the child) is very short. Clarification of this situation would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.MPP
