Vesicular stomatitis (VS) confirmed in West Texas; 1st US case since l998
-------------------------------------------------
The country's 1st case of Vesicular Stomatitis (VS) since 1998 was
confirmed Wed 19 May 2004 on a premises with 9 horses and 8 head of cattle
near Balmorhea, in Reeves County, in West Texas. VS is a viral disease that
occurs sporadically in the US, usually in south western states. The disease
can affect horses, cattle, and pigs, and, occasionally, sheep, goats, and
deer. The disease causes blisters to form in the animal's mouth, on teats,
or along the hooves, resulting in excessive salivation, lameness, or oozing
sores.
The clinical signs of VS can cause concern, because they mimic those of a
foreign, highly contagious, animal infection -- foot and mouth disease
(FMD) -- which has not been seen in the US since 1929. Laboratory tests
must be run to differentiate between the 2 diseases when cattle, pigs,
sheep, or other cloven-hooved animals develop signs of the disease. Unlike
FMD, VS also can affect horses and other members of the equine family.
Although the disease does not affect food safety, infected livestock are
withheld from slaughter until they recover.
"We always launch a disease investigation when blisters or sores are
reported in livestock to determine if FMD has been introduced into the US,"
said Dr Max Coats, deputy director for Animal Health Programs for the Texas
Animal Health Commission (TAHC), the state's livestock and poultry health
regulatory agency. "Because horses are not susceptible to FMD, we knew, in
this case, that the animals had vesicular stomatitis (VS), or, possibly,
had come in contact with poison, or a toxic plant. The National Veterinary
Services Laboratory (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa, has confirmed that the 3 horses
in Reeves County have VS."
Dr Coats said researchers have determined that VS outbreaks are started by
a virus transmitted by arthropods such as ticks, mites, biting midges,
mosquitoes, or house flies. Following an incubation period of 2 to 8 days,
infected animals may develop clinical signs of disease. The outbreak then
can be perpetuated by biting insects that carry the disease from infected
to healthy livestock. VS infected animals also can spread the virus when
their saliva, or the fluid from ruptured blisters, contaminates equipment
or feed shared by herd mates. Sick animals should be isolated until they
heal, he said. Dr Coats noted that all livestock on the affected ranch in
Reeves County will remain quarantined for several weeks, until they no
longer pose a health threat to other livestock. Before release from
quarantine, the animals will be re-examined by a state or federal
regulatory veterinarian to prevent the spread of disease to other premises.
"VS is rarely fatal, and infection usually runs its course in a couple of
weeks," commented Dr Coats. "Infected livestock may need supportive care to
prevent secondary infections where blisters have ruptured. The affected
animals also may lose condition, because they will avoid eating as long as
their mouth is sore. Lesions can also occur along hooves, resulting in
temporary lameness."
"The only thing regular about VS is its irregularity," he said. "13 years
passed between a l982-1983 outbreak of VS and one in l995 that involved
infection on more than 365 ranches in 5 states. These affected states were
New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona, Utah, and Texas, where infection was
confined to only one premises."
"Texas was spared, in May l997, when the disease was detected in Arizona in
horses. By late fall, when the outbreak ended, infection had been detected
on 380 ranches in 4 states: Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah," he
continued. "Prior to today's case, VS was most recently confirmed in l998
in Texas' Reeves County and in New Mexico."
"As a biosecurity measure, ranchers and veterinarians should wear rubber or
latex gloves when handling potentially infected animals, and they should
wash their hands thoroughly afterward. Humans reportedly may contract VS
and develop flu-like symptoms that can last 4 to 7 days," warned Dr Coats.
"If your livestock develops blisters, erosions or sores, don't pass it off
as another case of VS," Dr Coats said. "It is extremely important that we
collect samples and have laboratory tests run to determine the cause of
illness. Report these signs of disease to your private veterinary
practitioner or to the TAHC immediately. The TAHC hotline number is
operational 24 hours a day at 1-800-550-8242, and a TAHC or US Department
of Agriculture veterinarian always is on call to take reports and to work
with your private veterinarian at no charge."
"If you plan to ship horses, or other livestock, out of state, contact the
state of destination prior to transporting the animals," urged Dr. Coats.
"Because VS has been confirmed in Texas, some states may require our
shipments of livestock to undergo additional inspections or testing.
Producers and veterinarians may contact the TAHC at 1-800-550-8242 if they
need contact information for animal health officials in other states."
