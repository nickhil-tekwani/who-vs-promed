Indonesia: Avian Influenza Situation - WHO Update 38
-----------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health in Indonesia has confirmed 2 additional cases
of human infection with H5N1 avian influenza. The 1st newly confirmed
case was a 19-year-old woman from Tangerang, near Jakarta, who
developed symptoms on 19 Oct 2005, was admitted to the hospital on 26
Oct 2005, and died on 28 Oct 2005. The 2nd case is her 8-year-old
brother. He developed symptoms on 25 Oct 2005 and remains
hospitalized in good condition.

Field investigation has found evidence of sick and dying chickens in
the residential area of the 8-year-old. His 19-year-old sister is
known to have visited this area. Final results from an ongoing
Ministry of Agriculture investigation are pending.

To date, Indonesia has confirmed 9 cases of human H5N1 infection, of
which 5 have been fatal.

[Previous reports from Indonesia identified the 8-year-old boy as the
nephew (not the brother) of the deceased woman. Curiously, the WHO
update does not mention the health status of the nurse who cared for
the deceased woman, who is considered by the Indonesian health
authorities to be a suspected case of H5N1 avian influenza, nor the
current heath status of the woman's daughter and other nephew who
tested negative at an earlier stage in the investigation (see:
ProMED-mail post, "Avian influenza, human - East Asia (160):
Indonesia 20051105.3239"). - Mod.CP]
