The Rayong provincial administration announced that the province is a
dengue disaster zone after 1397 people were infected and 2 of them
were killed [by dengue] this year [2008].

Rayong deputy governor Siripong Hantrakul said declaring a disaster
zone allowed the provincial administration to spend its emergency
fund of Bt 50 million [USD 1 484 340] to fight the dengue spread.

He said Rayong remained at the top of the list of provinces with the highest
dengue spread rate.

(MBDS) initiative (see Dengue - Thailand (07): Rayong 20080809.2448).

According to the dengue surveillance data from the Ministry of Public
Health website dated 5 Aug 2008, the total number of reported cases
of dengue infections in Thailand is 43 911 cases with 46 deaths
nationwide -- which includes 18 797 cases and 2 deaths of dengue
fever (DF), 24 455 cases and 14 deaths of dengue hemorrhagic fever
(DHF) and 659 cases and 30 deaths of dengue shock syndrome (DSS). The
number of reported dengue cases in Rayong in this same period is a
total of 1426 cases and 2 deaths with 664 cases and no deaths for
dengue fever (DF), 757 cases and one death for dengue hemorrhagic
fever (DHF), and 5 cases and one death for dengue shock syndrome
(DSS).

More information on the data of respective dengue reports by province
and region are available at the dengue surveillance data webpages
from the Ministry of Public Health, Thailand website at
<http://203.157.15.4/surdata/disease.php?ds=66> for dengue fever,
<http://203.157.15.4/surdata/disease.php?ds=26> for dengue
hemorrhagic fever, and
<http://203.157.15.4/surdata/disease.php?ds=27> for dengue shock syndrome.

respective files for dengue fever reports by province and region,

In the prior PRO/MBDS report on the dengue situation in Thailand,
with a focus on the situation in Bangkok, as of 26 Jul 2008 there
were totals of 41 307 cases and 48 deaths attributable to dengue
reported in Thailand, with 3763 cases reported from Bangkok and 1291
cases from Rayong province (see prior PRO/MBDS posting Dengue -
Thailand (06) 20080801.2359).

[2] Laos

The public has been urged by health officials to take special care to
reduce the death toll from dengue fever, which has killed 18 people
so far this year [2008].

According to the National Centre for Laboratory and Epidemiology,
there have been more than 1900 cases of dengue fever in Laos this
year [2008], with 18 fatalities -- 9 dead in Champassak province, 7
dead in Saravan province, and one fatality each in Khammuan and
Xayaboury provinces. This figure is up from July [2008], when about
400 cases and 15 deaths had been reported.

Champassak province Public Health Department Deputy Director, Dr
Thongsa Saly, said the dengue fever situation was under control,
although the department would continue to raise public awareness
about dengue fever all year round to minimise the number of people
afflicted.

He said measures to prevent dengue fever included clearing thick
bushes around houses and sleeping in insecticide-treated mosquito
nets. He also said the public should ensure old tins and tyres were
turned upside-down and change water in vases regularly.

"We have a health network operating in all districts and we will send
our staff immediately to control the virus wherever it is detected,"
he said.

Public Health Department staff in Saravan province [are undertaking]
similar control measures to those in Champassak province.

Saravan province Malaria Centre Deputy Head, Dr Thongsavanh
Tiemmalay, said that last year [2007] there was only one fatality in
the province from dengue fever. The larger number of victims this
year [2008] may be due to an earlier than normal rainy season which
had increased the mosquito population.

The department currently has a mobile team set up in every district
of the province and these teams regularly work with local people to
raise awareness of the illness. They use radio, television, and
public address systems in offices to inform residents of the dangers
of dengue fever and what can be done to prevent it.

"We need the participation of everyone to fight against the dengue
virus," Dr Thongsavanh said.

Dengue fever is a seasonal disease that causes fatalities every year
in the wet season. Because of this, health officials said if people
fall ill at this time of the year they should suspect the dengue
fever virus may be the cause of their illness.

[The following moderator comment accompanied a similar posting on the
ProMED-mail collaboration with the Mekong Basin Disease Surveillance
(MBDS) initiative (see Dengue - Laos (03): RFI 20080805.2393).

According to the newswires above, the number of reported cases of
dengue in Laos (more than 1900) has increased more than 3-fold since
information available in a 17 May 2008 posting (see Dengue - Laos
20080517.1643) when there were 581 cases of dengue fever. The number
of fatalities reported in the newswires represents a 6-fold increase
since the information available in the 17 May 2008 posting when there
were reports of 3 deaths -- 2 in Champassak and one in Saravan
provinces. Of note is that the newswire above mentions that there
were approximately 400 cases of dengue reported for the year in July
2008 (presumably for the period 1 Jan 2008 through 1 Jul 2008) with
15 deaths -- representing a lower number of cases reported for the
year than was available in the 17 May 2008 newswire, but a 5-fold
increase in numbers of fatalities from the 17 May 2008 report. In the
last PRO/MBDS report on dengue in Laos posted on 14 Jun 2008 (see
Dengue - Laos (02): RFI 20080614.1879) there were reports of more
than 200 cases in Saravan province and 73 cases in Sekong province of
Laos since the beginning of 2008, with no information on fatalities,
or dengue fever incidence nationwide.

As one can see, relying upon newswires alone for following exact
disease incidence and mortality associated with the disease is
difficult and filled with contradictions and confusing information.
Hence, PRO/MBDS would greatly appreciate clarification of the
reported morbidity and mortality to date attributable to dengue in
Laos in 2008 from knowledgeable sources in the region.

The Department of Public Health and Social Services is warning Guam's
delegation who recently attended FestPac [10th Pacific Arts Festival]
to be mindful that 4 people tested positive in American Samoa for
dengue fever.

No cases of dengue (suspect or confirmed) in the Guam delegation to
FestPac have, to this date, been reported to Guam DPHSS [Department
of Public Health and Social Services.]

[A similar story by Tessa Borja and Therese Hart with some additional
information was reported in Marianas Variety of Guam on 7 Aug 2008
(<http://guam.mvarietynews.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=649%3Ahepatitis-outbreak-in-chuuk-senators-mull-travel-restrictions&catid=1%3Aguam-local-news&Itemid=2>.)
The story reports that in American Samoa, as of 30 Jul 2008, 4 cases
of rapid-test-confirmed dengue fever were reported. To date there
have been no cases of DHF. Of the recent cases, 2 were local
residents while 2 were delegates to the 10th Pacific Arts Festival.
Festival participants, including a delegation from Guam, were made
aware of the possibility of becoming ill upon their return home. A
local Guam senator has proposed restricting entry into Guam of
individuals who are traveling from areas identified by the USA
Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization
(WHO) as having a health-related outbreak. Although concern about
travelers bringing in serious pathogens unto an area is valid,
imposing travel restrictions on individuals coming from areas where
outbreaks occur would be problematic, since that would include a
great many countries, and the proposed legislation apparently does
not include restrictions on travel from countries where serious
diseases are endemic. - Mod.TY
