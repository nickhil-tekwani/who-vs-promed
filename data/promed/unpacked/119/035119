About 2 months ago, the spread of hemorrhagic fever in Arbil was reported.
The disease killed a veterinary assistant and a butcher in the Arbil
abattoir. Dr Nariman Hawez, the director-general of animal and veterinary
resources at the office of the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation
stated this viral disease is enzootic in Iraq and the Middle East. It is
transmitted to animals by ticks, and it can infect humans through injuries
contaminated with animal blood and remains.
He added, "We held an urgent joint meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture
and Irrigation attended by the Health, Municipalities and Interior
Ministries, and FAO and WHO to lay down an appropriate program to face and
prevent the spread of this disease in our region. We published instructions
and advice for citizens, the owners of cattle and abattoirs to protect
themselves from this serious disease.".
Dr Nariman Hawez reaffirmed the Directorate-General of Animal Resources
and Veterinary, took the necessary measures at the outset, stopped the
works of the veterinary teams and formed 55 mobile teams to:
1. Spray all animals' pens, abattoirs and meat shops daily, and this
process is continuing;
2. Treat animals against internal and external parasites, demolish
illegal animal pens in the city that are not licensed and prevent the
import of animals and meat from outside the region.
The director-general of animal and veterinary resources said, "As we
continue to take precautionary measures against this disease, we reassure
the citizens there is no recorded case of this disease in our areas, and
consumption of meat does not form any risk to their health. There are no
threats of this disease being transmitted to humans and we will exert all
efforts to cooperate with the Ministry of Health and other parties to
protect the people from this communicable disease."
