Referring to the request for species identification of wild birds in
which influenza viruses have been detected [Avian Influenza - Eurasia
(44): Europe], I would like to inform that the [sample referred to
as] unspecified seagull from Finland reported 26 Aug 2005 was
actually a combined sample consisting of visceral organs of 3
emaciated juvenile herring gulls (_Larus argentatus_) found dead with
pulmonary aspergillosis, intestinal trematode infection, and, in one
bird, Salmonella infection.
The influenza virus (H13N6) was isolated at the National Veterinary
and Food Research Institute in Helsinki, and typed at the OIE
Reference Laboratory VLA Weybridge.
The herring gull is one of 6 species of gulls nesting in the
municipality of Oulu. During summers, there are hundreds or even
thousands of immature (sub-adult) herring gulls in Oulu.
