The country [Malaysia] is on the brink of one of the largest dengue outbreaks, Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr S Subramaniam warned.

The number of deaths compared with the same period last year [2014], he explained, had doubled to 157 with over 40 000 reported cases.

"We are seeing more and more 2nd-time infections," he told reporters after attending the ministry's "Buka Puasa" [breaking of the fast] event [in Kuala Lumpur] this evening [Tue 23 Jun 2015]. He said many of the patients were coming down with a different type of dengue strain the 2nd time.

Subramaniam pointed out there were 4 different types of dengue virus and there were [no] proper vaccines to deal with them. "Patients can get infected by dengue up to 4 times. More and more patients who are coming in for treatment for the 2nd time, are suffering from liver infection, brain infection, and other more complicated problems."

He urged the public to take extra precautions especially during the early morning hours and late evenings.

Subramaniam said there has been a drastic increase in cases in Penang and Johor, although authorities at all levels were working hard to deal with the outbreak. He added the public must also play their part by making sure there are no mosquito breeding grounds in the areas where they live.

Subramaniam said dengue infection was a continuous problem in tropical countries but strict enforcement will help curb the problem.

[The increasing burden of dengue is reflected in the 2002 World Health Assembly resolution WHA55.17, urging greater commitment to dengue by WHO and its Member States. Of particular significance is the 2005 World Health Assembly resolution WHA58.3 on the revision of the International Health Regulations (IHR), which includes dengue as an example of a disease that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern, with implications for health security due to disruption and rapid epidemic spread beyond national borders.

Primary infection is thought to induce lifelong protective immunity to the infecting serotype. Individuals suffering an infection are protected from clinical illness with a different serotype within 2-3 months of the primary infection but with no long-term cross-protective immunity.

Individual risk factors determine the severity of disease and include secondary infection, age, ethnicity, and possibly chronic diseases (bronchial asthma, sickle cell anaemia, and diabetes mellitus). Young children in particular may be less able than adults to compensate for capillary leakage and are consequently at greater risk of dengue shock.

"Asian" genotypes of DEN-2 and DEN-3 are frequently associated with severe disease accompanying secondary dengue infections (http://www.who.int/tdr/publications/documents/dengue-diagnosis.pdf).

As of 30 May 2015, there were 47 112 cases of dengue reported in Malaysia for 2015. This is 34 percent higher compared with the same reporting period of 2014 (n=35 070).

There was co-circulation of DEN-1 and DEN-3 serotypes in French Polynesia in 2013 and early 2014, while mostly DEN-1 has been the prevalent serotype thereafter until week 22 of 2015 (week ending 6 Jun 2015; http://www.wpro.who.int/emerging_diseases/dengue_biweekly_20150617.pdf).

It is of the utmost importance to reinforce multi-sectoral prevention and control measures well in advance of a possible dengue epidemic, especially at the beginning of rainy seasons.

[This report is confusing in that it opens stating that there are 593 deaths but later in the report indicates that there are 3 deaths, which seems more reasonable, and the 573 number is the case count. - Mod.TY]

[This seems like a high number of fatal cases. However, accruing accurate case numbers in the middle of a civil war is daunting, and the count is almost certain to be inaccurate.
