The following background data on bartonellosis were extracted from the
GIDEON software program:
_Bartonella bacilliformis_ is an aerobic gram-negative coccobacillus
transmitted by flies of the genus Lutzomyia. Cases may also be acquired
through blood products. Following an incubation period of 2 to 4 weeks
(range 1 to 14 weeks), the patient may develop Oroya fever (headache,
myalgia, arthralgia, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly and anemia) and/or
Verruga peruana (persistent red-to-violaceous, verrucous or fungating skin
lesions.). Diagnosis is accomplished through culture on specialized media
or visualization of organisms adherent to erythrocytes. Therapy may
include chloramphenicol, alternative ampicillin, penicillin or
tetracycline. Rifampin is used for second-stage infections.
This disease is limited to the habitat of its sandfly vectors: Andes river
valleys at altitudes of 500 to 3,000 meters, from southwestern Colombia to
central Peru (2o N to 13o S).
The first cases in Colombia were encountered as an epidemic during 1936 to
1941 (over 6,000 cases in Narino Department). Subsequent cases were
reported in Bolivar (Cauca Department) in 1941. No additional cases were
confirmed until 1988, when a single case was reported. The presumed local
vector is _Lutzomyia columbiana_.
In Ecuador most cases are reported from Loja and Guayas (notably Panan and
Chongon-Colonche uplands). Sporadic cases occur in Los Rios, El Oro, Azuay
and Tungurahua. Outbreaks were reported in 1939 (Loja Province), 1940
(Zaruma and Portovelo) and 1942 (Zumba, Zamora Chinchipe Province). 27
sporadic cases were registered during 1944 to 1978. 17 cases were
identified in Zamora Chinchipe during 1984 to 1995; 19 in the same province
during 1995 to 1996. During 1987 to 1995, bartonellosis was found to expand
into the lowland province of Manabi in a milder (cutaneous) form. The
principal vector in Ecuador is _Lutzomyia verrucarum_.
In Peru, cases are reported at elevations as high as 3375 meters (town of
Huasta). 200 fatal cases were reported during an outbreak in 1959. 197
cases were reported in 1979; 389 in 1980; 495 in 1981; 3795 in 1982. 14
fatal cases were reported during an outbreak in Shumpillan Village, in
1987. The local vector is _Lutzomyia verrucarum_.
