The Capital Development Authority (CDA) Health Services Department has
confirmed 35 cases of hepatitis C and 12 cases of hepatitis B among people
working at beauty salons and barbershops in different sectors of Islamabad.
The CDA health services department collected the blood samples of 445
workers of various beauty salons and barbershops and conducted laboratory
tests on the samples. The test report suggested that 47 people were
suffering from hepatitis B and C.
The DMA department of the CDA will issue a trade license to all
hairdressers and beauty salons within Islamabad on the basis of a No
Objection Certificate (NOC) that will be issued after a blood test of the
applicant. The CDA has requested citizens to visit only those beauty and
hairdressing shops that have been issued NOCs and approved by the CDA.

[From the limited information contained in this report it is difficult to
establish the purpose of this survey or to assess the significance of the
data. The overall frequency of hepatitis (B and/or C) at 10.6 per cent in
those employed as barbers or beauticians in Islamabad is considerably
higher than the figure of 2.6 percent for the general population according
to the Pakistan Ministry of Health website
<http://www.wpro.who.int/NR/rdonlyres/4C8D01A5-517F-4DE2-99A4-866552CC5F1D/0/04Pakistan11.pdf>.
Whatever the reason for this situation it would be prudent for the local
population and visitors alike to make use of the accreditation system now
being put in place by the Islamabad authorities. - Mod.CP]
