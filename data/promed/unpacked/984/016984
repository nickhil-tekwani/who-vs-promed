Animal health officials in California and Minnesota have confirmed new cases of West Nile virus (WNV) in horses in those states.

In California, 2 cases were confirmed on 19 Aug 2016. A statement from the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) said the horses -- a 2-year-old unvaccinated Quarter Horse gelding in Calaveras County and an 18-year-old unvaccinated gelding in Ventura County -- were both displaying neurologic signs at the time of diagnosis but are recovering.

"For 2016, a total of 8 horses have been confirmed positive for WNV," the CDFA statement said. "The positive horses are located in the following counties: Fresno, Calaveras, Riverside, Sacramento, San Diego, San Joaquin, Sutter, and Ventura counties. All horses were not current on their WNV vaccinations. 2 of the 8 positive confirmed horses were euthanized."

Meanwhile, in Minnesota, the equine WNV case count has risen to 7. The state Board of Animal Health provided at list of confirmed cases in the state thus far in 2016:
- Bertha, Todd County: confirmed 9 Aug 2016. A 6-year-old Standardbred gelding was euthanized on 30 Jul 2016 due to disease progression; he was not vaccinated.
- McIntosh, Polk County: confirmed 12 Aug 2016. A 4-year-old female draft horse is uncoordinated, but able to stand and walk; she was not vaccinated.
- Sacred Heart, Renville County: confirmed 12 Aug 2016. An 8-year-old Quarter Horse gelding was euthanized on 10 Aug 2016 due to disease progression; he was not vaccinated.
- Utica, Winona County: confirmed 16 Aug 2016. A Morgan mare is receiving supportive care and is on her feet and slowly improving; she was not vaccinated.
- Stanchfield, Chisago County: confirmed 18 Aug 2016. An 8-year-old Appaloosa gelding show horse is having difficulty standing on his own; he was not vaccinated.

[Horses were also diagnosed in
- Winthrop, Sibley County: confirmed 2 Aug 2016. A 1.5-year-old Friesian stallion was euthanized on 5 Aug 2016 due to progression of the disease; he was not vaccinated.
- Milaca, Mille Lacs County: confirmed 3 Aug 2016. A draft-cross stallion is receiving supportive care and is able to stand, eat, and drink on his own; he was not vaccinated. These cases were previously reported on ProMED-mail; see archive no 20160804.4394701. - Mod.TG]

West Nile is transmitted to horses via bites from infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs for WNV include flulike signs, where the horse seems mildly anorexic and depressed; fine and coarse muscle and skin fasciculations (twitching); hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound); changes in mentation (mentality), when horses look like they are daydreaming or "just not with it"; occasional somnolence (drowsiness); propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control); and "spinal" signs, including asymmetrical weakness. Some horses show asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia. Equine mortality rate can be as high as 30-40 percent.

Horse owners should also consult their private practicing veterinarian to determine an appropriate disease prevention plan for their horses. Vaccines have proven to be a very effective prevention tool. Horses that have been vaccinated in past years will need an annual booster shot. However, if an owner did not vaccinate their animal in previous years, the horse will need the 2-shot vaccination series within a 3- to 6-week period.

In addition to vaccinations, horse owners also need to reduce the mosquito populations and their possible breeding areas. Recommendations include removing stagnant water sources, keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, which are typically early in the morning and evening, and using mosquito repellents.
