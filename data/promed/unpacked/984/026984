Foot rot disease has hit Goa's pepper crop and the wilting plantations
have left farmers dejected. Agriculture scientists estimate the losses
may range from 30 to 40 percent. Heavy rains, lack of timely measures,
and quick spread of the disease, also known as quick wilt, have wiped
out almost the entire plantations in some areas.

While old varieties of pepper are not much affected, it is newer
improved varieties with better yield, which have been wiped out. ICAR
[Indian Council of Agricultural Research] scientists and agriculture
department officials visited some areas to assess the damage. "This is
a serious loss of crop," ICAR said.

Goa's pepper cultivation, as a secondary crop in more than 5000 areca
[betelnut] palm plantations, is spread over 717 hectares [1772
acres].

[Quick wilt (also called foot rot) of black pepper (_Piper nigrum_) is
caused by the fungus-like organism _Phytophthora capsici_. It is
considered the most serious threat to this crop in India and a yield
decline of 75 percent has been reported in some instances. It affects
leaves and vines, but once roots are affected the plant wilts and dies
within a month.

The pathogen is spread by splashing rain and mechanical means. It has
a very wide host range and therefore a large pathogen reservoir making
it difficult to control. Disease management includes fungicides,
biocontrol, use of disease free and resistant cultivars and cultural
practices.

_Piper_ species are vines and have to be grown on vertical support.
Commercial tree crops are used for this purpose in some areas to give
a double crop from the plantings, such as the betelnut palms (_Areca
catechu_) as in the report above.
