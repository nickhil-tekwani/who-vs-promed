Albuquerque Salmonella Cases May Relate to Beef Jerky
---------------------------------------------------
A health protection advisory was issued by the city on Friday when several
cases of salmonella were confirmed and possibly linked to beef jerky. City
Environmental Health Department Director Alfredo Robert Santistevan said
beef jerky products produced at a city-inspected facility may have caused
the cases of the rare form of the illness.
Tests are still pending, and no particular brand of the beef jerky products
has been identified. The facility was immediately closed and its permit
was suspended, Santistevan said.
The state Health Department has identified 21 cases of _Salmonella
kiambu_. 14 of those people said they ate beef jerky. The department's
Office of Epidemiology, the state Environment Department and the city are
working together to investigate the cases.

[_Salmonella kiambu_ is a fairly unusual isolate. In a CDC 2001 Salmonella
annual report, 5 non-clinical isolates were found: 1 from a chicken and the
4 others from "all others" (not otherwise defined).
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/phlisdata/salmtab/2001/SalmonellaTable7_2001.pdf>
Regarding clinical isolates in 2001, 9 were reported: 5 of bovine origin
and 2 each of "other domestic animals/environment" and "other birds/wild
animals."

The following report from the Food Safety and Inspection Service
(<http://www.fsis.usda.gov/OA/pubs/jerky.htm>) is an excellent source of
information on this popular food:
"What is Jerky? This product is a nutrient-dense meat that has been made
lightweight by drying. A pound of meat or poultry weighs about 4 ounces
after being made into jerky. Because most of the moisture is removed, it is
shelf-stable -- can be stored without refrigeration -- making it a handy
food for backpackers and others who don't have access to refrigerators.
Jerky is a food known at least since ancient Egypt. Humans made jerky from
animal meat that was too big to eat all at once, such as bear, buffalo, or
whales. North American Indians mixed ground dried meat with dried fruit or
suet to make 'pemmican.' 'Biltong' is dried meat or game used in many
African countries. Our word "jerky" came from the Spanish word 'charque.'
How can drying meat make it safe? Drying is the world's oldest and most
common method of food preservation. Canning technology is less than 200
years old and freezing became practical only during this century, when
electricity became more and more available to people. Drying technology is
both simple and readily available to most of the world's cultures.
The scientific principle of preserving food by drying is that by removing
moisture, enzymes cannot efficiently contact or react with the food.
Whether these enzymes are bacterial, fungal, or naturally occurring
autolytic enzymes from the raw food, preventing this enzymatic action
preserves the food from biological action.
What are the types of food drying? There are several types of food drying.
2 types of natural drying -- sun drying and 'adibatic' (shade) drying --
occur in open air. Adibatic drying occurs without heat. Solar drying
sometimes takes place in a special container that catches and captures the
sun's heat. These types of drying are used mainly for fruits such as
apricots, tomatoes, and grapes (to make raisins).
Drying from an artificial heat source is done by placing food in either a
warm oven or a food dehydrator. The main components of an electric food
dehydrator include: a source of heat; air flow to circulate the dry air;
trays to hold the food during the drying process; and mesh or leather
sheets to dry certain types of foods.
Why is temperature important in making jerky? Illnesses due to
_Salmonella_ and _E. coli_ O157:H7 from homemade jerky raise questions
about the safety of traditional drying methods for making beef and venison
jerky. The USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline's current recommendation for
making jerky safely is to heat meat to 160 F before the dehydrating
process. This step assures that any bacteria present will be destroyed by
wet heat. But most dehydrator instructions do not include this step, and a
dehydrator may not reach temperatures high enough to heat meat to 160 F.
After heating to 160 F, maintaining a constant dehydrator temperature of
130 to 140 F during the drying process is important because the process
must be fast enough to dry food before it spoils, and it must remove enough
water that microorganisms are unable to grow.
Why is it a food safety concern to dry meat without first heating it to 160
F? The danger in dehydrating meat and poultry without cooking it to a safe
temperature first is that the appliance will not heat the meat to 160 F --
a temperature at which bacteria are destroyed -- before it dries. After
drying, bacteria become much more heat-resistant.
Within a dehydrator or low-temperature oven, evaporating moisture absorbs
most of the heat. Thus, the meat itself does not begin to rise in
temperature until most of the moisture has evaporated. Therefore, when the
dried meat temperature finally begins to rise, the bacteria have become
more heat-resistant and are more likely to survive. If these surviving
bacteria are pathogenic, they can cause foodborne illness to those
consuming the jerky.
What Research Findings Exist on the Safety of Jerky? There have been
several scientific studies of meat dehydrating and lab tests on jerky
samples by the following professionals: Judy Harrison, Cooperative
Extension Service, University of Georgia; Mark Harrison, the Center for
Food Safety and Quality Enhancement, Department of Food Science and
Technology, University of Georgia; Richard A. Holley, Food Research
Institute, Agriculture Canada, in Ontario; and William Keene of the Oregon
Health Division. In studies, the meat dehydrated included slices of beef
from the round, loin, or flank; corned beef slices; and ground beef formed
in jerky presses. Keene examined homemade venison jerky that infected 11
people with _E. coli_ O157:H7.
In a related work, factors affecting the heat resistance of _E. coli_
O157:H7 was the subject of an April 1998 piece by J. Kauer et al., Letters
of Applied Bacteriology, Vol. 26, No. 4, page 325. In the jerky studies,
some samples showed total bacterial destruction and other samples showed
some bacterial survival -- especially the jerky made with ground beef.
Further experiments with lab-inoculated venison showed that pathogenic _E.
coli_ could survive drying times of up to 10 hours and temperatures of up
to 145 F.
A recent study by the Harrisons and Ruth Ann Rose, also with the University
of Georgia, was published in the January 1998 Journal of Food Protection,
Vol. 61, No. 1. The authors analyzed ground beef jerky made with a
commercial beef jerky spice mixture with and without a curing mix
containing salt and sodium nitrite. Half of the ground beef was inoculated
with _E. coli_ O157:H7 before making it into jerky strips and dehydrating
it. The authors found that in both the heated and unheated samples, the
jerky made with the curing mix had greater destruction of bacteria than
jerky made without it. The jerky made with the mix and heated before
dehydrating had the highest destruction rate of bacteria. They concluded,
'For ground beef jerky prepared at home, safety concerns related to _E.
coli_ O157:H7 are minimized if the meat is precooked to 160 F prior to drying.'
What are the USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline's Recommendations for Making
Homemade Jerky? Research findings support what the Hotline has been
recommending to callers. Additionally, safe handling and preparation
methods must always be used, including:
Always wash hands thoroughly with soap and water before and after working
with meat products.
Use clean equipment and utensils.
Keep meat and poultry refrigerated at 40 F or slightly below; use or freeze
ground beef and poultry within 2 days; whole red meats, within 3 to 5 days.
Defrost frozen meat in the refrigerator, not on the kitchen counter.
Marinate meat in the refrigerator. Don't save marinade to re-use. Marinades
are used to tenderize and flavor the jerky before dehydrating it.
Steam or roast meat and poultry to 160 F as measured with a meat
thermometer before dehydrating it.
Dry meats in a food dehydrator that has an adjustable temperature dial and
will maintain a temperature of at least 130 to 140 F throughout the drying
process.
Are There Special Considerations for Wild Game Jerky? Yes, there are other
special considerations when making homemade jerky from venison or other
wild game. According to Keene and his co-authors, 'Venison can be heavily
contaminated with fecal bacteria -- the degree varying with the hunter's
skill, wound location, and other factors. While fresh beef is usually
rapidly chilled, deer carcasses are typically held at ambient temperatures,
potentially allowing bacteria multiplication.'
Is Commercially Made Jerky Safe? Yes, the process is monitored in
federally inspected plants by inspectors of the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service. Products may be cured or
uncured, dried, and may be smoked or unsmoked, air- or oven-dried. The
following terms may be on processed jerky products: 'Beef Jerky' - produced
from a single piece of beef; 'Beef Jerky Chunked and Formed' - produced
from chunks of meat that are molded and formed, then cut into strips; 'Beef
Jerky Ground and Formed or Chopped and Formed' - produced from ground or
chopped meat, molded and cut into strips. Beef Jerky containing binders or
extenders must show true product name (e.g., 'Beef and Soy Protein
Concentrate Jerky, Ground and Formed');'Species (or Kind) Jerky Sausage' -
the product has been chopped and may be dried at any stage of the process,
and it is stuffed into casings.
What is the Safe Storage Time for Jerky? Commercially packaged jerky can be
kept 12 months; home-dried jerky can be stored 1 to 2 months." - Mod.LL]
