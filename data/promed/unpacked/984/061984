A team of 50 health experts is trying to find the cause of a
salmonella outbreak in British Columbia that [may have] left
thousands of people sick with mild to severe symptoms of diarrhea,
vomiting, and fever.

"No one has died and as far as I know everyone has recovered, but
there have been some hospitalizations," Eleni Galanis, an
epidemiologist with the BC Centre for Disease Control, said yesterday
[28 Jul 2008].

So far the investigators, drawn from several health authorities, have
not found the source of the disease, which is thought to be a tainted
food item distributed widely to restaurants and stores in the Lower
Mainland. Only 64 people have tested positive for the infection so
far, but health officials say the actual number of sick people is far
greater.

"What we see is the tip of the iceberg," Dr Galanis said. "For this
infection we think from 50 to 300 cases occur in the community for
every person that comes forward and is tested." That would mean an
estimated 3200 to 19 200 people have been infected in the Metro
Vancouver area and Fraser Valley in the past 2 months.

An alert was triggered several weeks ago, when an unusual number of
cases of salmonellosis was confirmed in stool samples taken from
people who came to their doctors with high fevers, vomiting, and
diarrhea. Since the end of June 2008, experts from the BC Centre for
Disease Control and several other health agencies have been
investigating the cause.

"It's called _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Enteritidis," said Dr
Galanis, naming the strain identified in the 64 confirmed patients.
"Enteritidis is usually associated with poultry, eggs, or produce
contaminated with one of those 2 sources. ... We're investigating all
of those [possibilities] and so far we haven't found a source.

"We're pretty convinced it's a food item. It's probably a food that
was distributed widely across the Lower Mainland, both to restaurants
and to some grocery stores because there is no one place where this
food was served."

Several years ago, BC investigators traced a _S._ Enteritidis
outbreak to a location identified in public health reports only as
Bakery X. In that case, they found 11 sick people had visited one
bakery where large quantities of raw eggs were being pooled to
produce tart fillings and to be brushed on dough. The Canadian Food
Inspection Agency (CFIA) traced the eggs back to a single farm, and
the organism was found in the barn. The investigation led to a
temporary shutdown of the bakery and a recall of eggs from the farm.

"We expect more [cases] to be reported. ...They are testing them in
the lab this week," Galanis said.
