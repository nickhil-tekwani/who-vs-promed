CDC is collaborating with public health officials in Tennessee and the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS) to investigate an outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Heidelberg infections at a Tennessee correctional facility. Results from Tennessee's investigation indicate that mechanically separated chicken produced by Tyson Foods, Inc. is the likely source of the outbreak at the Tennessee correctional facility.

Public health investigators are using DNA "fingerprints" of bacteria obtained through diagnostic testing with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, or PFGE, to identify additional cases of illness that may be part of this outbreak. They are using data from PulseNet, the national subtyping network made up of state and local public health laboratories and federal food regulatory laboratories that performs molecular surveillance of foodborne infections. This strain of _S._ Heidelberg is common in the PulseNet database. 4 to 8 cases of this strain are reported to PulseNet every month.

A total of 9 ill people infected with the outbreak strain of _S._ Heidelberg have been reported from a Tennessee correctional facility. CDC has identified 19 additional people infected with this same strain from 12 other states with illness onset dates ranging from 22 Oct 2013 to 15 Dec 2013. Investigations are ongoing to determine if these cases are related to the outbreak in Tennessee or if they are part of the expected number of illnesses reported during this time. The names of these states will not be released until it is determined if they are part of this outbreak.

Among those in Tennessee for whom information is available, illness onset dates range from 28 Nov 2013 to 29 Nov 2013. Ill people range in age from 22 years to 50 years, with a median age of 36 years. All of those who have been ill are male. Among 9 ill people with available information, 2 (22 per cent) reported being hospitalized. No deaths have been reported. All of the ill people are incarcerated at a single correctional facility in Tennessee.

Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------------
Epidemiologic and traceback investigations conducted by officials in Tennessee and USDA-FSIS indicate that consumption of mechanically separated chicken products produced by Tyson Foods, Inc. is the likely source of this outbreak of _Salmonella_ Heidelberg infections. Mechanically separated chicken is a paste-like chicken product produced by forcing the poultry through a sieve to separate the bone from the edible tissue.

In interviews, ill people at the Tennessee correctional facility answered questions about foods consumed and other exposures during the week before becoming ill. 8 (89 per cent) of 9 ill people interviewed reported consuming foods containing mechanically separated chicken in the week before becoming ill. Investigations at the correctional facility determined that the chicken served during the exposure period was Tyson brand mechanically separated chicken.

CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory is currently conducting antibiotic resistance testing on clinical isolates collected from ill people infected with the outbreak strain of _S._ Heidelberg. Results of this testing will be reported when they become available. NARMS is a USA public health surveillance system that tracks antimicrobial resistance in foodborne and other enteric bacteria found in people, raw meat and poultry, and food-producing animals. NARMS is an interagency partnership among the CDC, the FDA, the USDA, and state and local health departments. The NARMS human surveillance program monitors antibiotic resistance in salmonella, campylobacter, shigella, _Escherichia coli_ O157, and vibrio bacteria isolated from clinical specimens and submitted to NARMS by public health laboratories.

On 10 Jan 2014, Tyson Foods, Inc. recalled about 33 840 pounds [15.35 tons] of mechanically separated chicken products that may be contaminated with _S._ Heidelberg. The chicken products were produced on 11 Oct 2013, and shipped for institutional use only nationwide. The product is not available for consumer purchase in retail stores.

CDC and state and local public health partners are continuing laboratory surveillance through PulseNet to identify additional ill people and to interview ill people about foods eaten before becoming ill. USDA-FSIS is continuing to work closely with CDC and state partners in this investigation.

This outbreak of _S._ Heidelberg infections is not related to the multistate outbreak of multidrug-resistant _S._ Heidelberg infections linked to Foster Farms brand chicken.
