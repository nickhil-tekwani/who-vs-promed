Kunjin and Murray Valley Encephalitis Viruses Alert - Australia (Northern
Territory)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Territory Health Services (THS) has issued a warning to Northern Territory
(NT) residents and visitors to the Top End, as well as people of northwest
Western Australia (WA), to take extra precautions over the next 2 months
against being bitten by mosquitoes following recent [detection of Kunjin
virus in sentinel chickens. [The warning particularly applies particularly
to people visiting and camping in or near swamp and river systems during
the evening and night, and in any area with relatively high mosquito activity.
The sentinel chickens have shown recent evidence of Kunjin virus activity
in the Darwin rural area and the Katherine area. The sentinel chicken
program -- a joint program between the Department of Primary Industry and
Fisheries (DPI&F), THS, WA Health, and volunteers -- acts as an early
warning system. In addition, the DPI&F has advised that sentinel pigs near
Beatrice Hill in the rural area of Darwin have indicated the presence of a
virus, which may be either Kunjin or Murray Valley encephalitis. Tests
involving the sentinel pigs are in progress. WA Health has advised that
early [evidence of Murray Valley encephalitis virus activity was detected
in sentinel chickens in the Kimberley and Pilbara regions of WA during
December 2000.
The latest information, together with past experience, indicates that there
is a current risk from Kunjin virus disease and the related, but more
dangerous, Australian [more accurately, Murray valley - Mod.CP
encephalitis across the north coast of the NT, and south to at least the
Katherine region. The main risk period in the Top End is generally from
January to May, but this year the areas of risk are considered to extend to
Katherine, including the Barkly and Victoria River District areas because
of continuing high mosquito numbers and flooded conditions. A reduced risk
applies to the Central Australia region after the very recent rain,
although there is no current indication of a rise in mosquito numbers or
virus activity in the sentinel chickens.
Kunjin virus disease, caused by Kunjin virus, [is generally non-fatal with
symptoms of fever and severe headache. Australian encephalitis, caused by
Murray Valley encephalitis virus, is a potentially fatal illness. The
[usual symptoms of Australian encephalitis are severe headache, stiff
neck, high fever, and in some cases the disease progresses to delirium and
coma.
These 2 viruses are seasonally present in the north west of WA and the Top
End of the Northern Territory during most years. Both are transmitted by
the bite of the common banded mosquito (_Culex annulirostris_), which
occurs in highest numbers during and just after the wet season. Not all of
these mosquitoes will be carrying a virus, and only about one person in
1000 bitten by mosquitoes with the virus will get the disease. THS advise
that there is no vaccine for Australian [Murray Valley encephalitis or
Kunjin virus disease and that the only protection is to avoid being bitten
by mosquitoes.

[Kunjin virus, Murray Valley encephalitis virus, and West Nile virus are
closely related viruses belonging to the Japanese encephalitis virus
serogroup of mosquito-borne flaviviruses. Kunjin virus is restricted to
Australia, whereas Murray Valley encephalitis virus is endemic in New
Guinea and parts of Australia. - Mod.CP
