Farmers in Mogotio [Baringo County] have appealed for government intervention following a strange skin disease that hit their cattle.

The disease is causing lesions on the animals' skin and also affecting the eyes, mouth and respiratory tract.

Emanuel Chakinin, a veterinary officer from Elsama Ravine, described the condition as lumpy skin disease [but see comment].

The vet, who has been operating on animals affected by the disease, urged farmers to report the cases early to save their livestock from death.

Now residents are asking the national government to send more vets to the region to deal with the disease and help them avoid losses.

[The pictures accompanying the above text (see in the source URL) present serious cases of bovine papillomatosis (infectious warts) affecting young bovines.

Bovine papillomatosis is a worldwide common viral disease of the skin, mostly of young cattle, manifested as benign tumours or warts, caused by bovine papillomavirus (BPV) that has several serotypes. These neoplasms most often regress spontaneously, occasionally persist, and, in the presence of additional critical genetic or environmental factors, can progress to cancer. Furthermore, papillomavirus infection in cattle could be connected with serious disorders of the metabolism (mainly mineral, energetic and nitrous) probably caused by damage of the liver and kidney with mutagenic, carcinogenic and immunosuppressive cadmium, arsenic and lead, observed in the serum of tested animals.

Bovine papillomavirus (BPV) is a group of DNA viruses of the family Papillomaviridae that are common in cattle. Infection causes warts (papillomas and fibropapillomas) of the skin and alimentary tract, and more rarely cancers of the alimentary tract and urinary bladder. They are also thought to cause the skin tumour equine sarcoid in horses and donkeys.

Different methods have been used to treat bovine papillomas. A formalinized suspension of bovine warts with inactivated virus provides a vaccine for effective treatment and prophylaxis of bovine papillomatosis.
