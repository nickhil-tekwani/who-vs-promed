LIONS, FATAL ILLNESS - EAST AFRICA
==================================
Source: Newspaper O Globo, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 19 Feb 1996 p.19
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Lions are dying again in Kenya & Tanzania. Since the end of 1995 one
third of the lions in the Serengeti Park (Tanzania) have died. The cause
is thought to be the same virus that killed 3000 lions in Aug.1994, a
canine distemper virus that has jumped species to felines. The chain of
infection is suspected to be from wild African hunting dogs to hyenas to
lions.
Researchers at the Univ. of Tennessee (USA) are said to be studying the
virus. Are any of you reading this? Can you give further details? - Mod.JW

[- "Since the end of 1995" is an elastic date and if true reflects a very
efficient reporting system. This report should be regarded with caution
until authritative confirmation is provided. MH-J Promed-AHEAD Moderator]
