The Minister of Health, Dr Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al-Rabiah, has announced
that during Hajj season this year [2010] and for the 1st time in the Middle
East, advanced services in the field of diagnosis and treatment of pilgrims
will be introduced by using a device for laboratory examination that
diagnoses 10 000 viruses, defines all kinds of microbes (bacteria, viruses,
fungi and parasites), clarifies the division of the viral genes and
identifies their different patterns using the broad spectrum of the organs
of polymerase chain reaction quickly and accurately without the need for
the work of any laboratory breeding.

He noted that 135 consultants in various rare specialties have been called
in for participation in the provision of specialized medical services to
pilgrims and operating units around the clock.

The undersecretary of the Ministry of Health for Planning and Development
and chairman of Hajj committees Dr Mohammed Khoshaim said that development
of the medical project in the holy sites costs SR 180 million [approx USD
48 million].

Since the death of a young medical resident in Pakistan, Crimean Congo
hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) has increasingly come into the limelight. 22 cases
of CCHF have been confirmed this year [2010] (13 from Rawalpindi, 3 from
Islamabad, one from Abbottabad and 5 from Balochistan).

Health authorities in partnership with WHO are studying the potential
impact of the flood in the frequency of these fevers, and it is likely that
levels this year [2010] will be even higher.

Pakistan's Ministry of Health is developing a prevention and control
campaign to stop the spread of hemorrhagic fevers in the country. "For the
CCHF, the great concern is the upcoming Eidul Azha [Eid Al Adha] period,
when over one million animals are expected to be slaughtered, increasing
the possibility of people coming into contact with infected animal blood,"
says Dr Professor Rashid Jooma, Director General of Health, Pakistan. No
vaccine is available against CCHF, and treatment is primarily supportive,
although the antiviral ribavarin may be useful if available.

Of concern is the fact that the most vulnerable and at risk individuals in
Pakistan most likely have insufficient knowledge of the infection and have
little or no access to prevention and control measures, and even where they
do, they probably cannot afford them. On 11 Oct 2010, a meeting of national
and international experts was convened at the National Institute of Health
in Islamabad to develop strategies to prevent increased CCHF transmission
during Eid-ul-Azha. The measures identified will be conducted in
coordination with the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and the
Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock. These include
- ensuring necessary bio-safety measures and stockpiling of medications and
other relevant supplies such as gloves, gowns and masks in tertiary care
hospitals and provincial health departments;
- raising awareness among the animal slaughterers;
- establishing a Clinical Forum of Hemorrhagic Fevers for doctors to agree
on triage and case management of patients with hemorrhagic fevers;
- rolling out an awareness campaign on prevention of both CCHF and dengue
for the general public;
- targeted vector control campaign.

It remains to be seen if these promises are kept. Will this supposed media
campaign to inform people on how to protect themselves from CCHF infection
transpire? If so, will it be appropriate and directed at the people that
need it most?

Sacrificial animals in the city [Lahore, Pakistan] markets are vulnerable
to diseases like flu and pneumonia because town administrations have not
arranged for proper veterinary care. Only one veterinary doctor has been
deputed to treat all the diseased animals in the market, and vaccines and
medicines are also not available in adequate quantity, The Express Tribune
has learnt.

Animal traders complain that poor sanitation conditions and negligent
arrangements are causing diseases in animals. Animals in poor health, they
say, will not attract buyers and would be a huge economic setback for them.
"The Livestock Department has not shown any real interest in ensuring the
sacrificial animals stay healthy. Limited staff has been deployed in the 8
cattle markets of Lahore," said a cattle trader.

Kasur resident Muhammad Yaqub, a cattle owner, said: "Sanitation facilities
are not adequate. The town administration has shown the same negligence it
did last year [2009]."

A veterinary doctor said, "Every cattle owner must vaccinate animals as a
precautionary measure to protect them from diseases." He said, "most cattle
owners do not vaccinate their animals properly, which is why animals fall ill."

Cattle owner Sadiq Ali admitted that he did not vaccinate his animals. He
said that he could not afford to do so. The cost of one dose of the vaccine
is Rs5 [USD 0.06].

One of the deputed veterinary doctors questioned how a single doctor could
treat every diseased animal in a large cattle market. He said that flu and
pneumonia were common amongst animals these days. The declining
temperatures and poor or irregular feed are also factors affecting their
health. He said that the authorities must depute sufficient staff to treat
the animals. He said that it seemed that the deployment of doctors at
cattle markets was aimed only at penalising them.

Ramzan Malik, a cattle owner, said, "The small number of veterinary doctors
assigned the task are incapable of handling serious or widespread diseases."

Nishtar Town cattle market in-charge Nadeem Javed agreed that facilities
were lacking and said: "The decision to transfer the cattle market outside
the city due to the Congo virus [CCHF] threat was also taken very late.
This has resulted in administrative hiccups." He said he would forward a
proposal for deputation of more veterinary doctors.

The Livestock Department had originally announced it would provide free
treatment facilities for animals in all markets for sacrificial animals.

Dubai Municipality has launched an awareness campaign called "Ensure your
health by safe sacrifice" in order to protect public health in preparation
for Eid Al Adha.

The campaign aims to introduce ways of safe sacrificial slaughter, create
public awareness of the importance of the role of the veterinary doctor,
the dangers of slaughtering outside, and seeking the services of roaming
butchers. The campaign targets housewives, school and university students
and all members of the society.

The campaign kicked off on Sunday [7 Nov 2010] in schools and an exhibition
on the ways of safe slaughter and warning of the dangers of slaughtering
outside on the public health was held in the main building of Dubai
Municipality on Wednesday [10 Nov 2010].

The municipality has assigned a number of employees of the Public Health
Services Department to educate people in the cattle market. Awareness
leaflets and booklets will also be distributed through cooperative
societies, vegetable markets, cattle markets, Auto Market, and the
municipality centres on the benefits of safe slaughter and the risks of
slaughtering outside.

In addition to this, the municipality will organise awareness lectures at
schools, universities and Princess Haya centres. At the municipality level,
employees will be educated through a series of awareness messages by
sending emails. The municipality will also coordinate with the Department
of Islamic Affairs and Charitable Activities in Dubai to raise awareness
about this subject through the Friday sermons.

Five slaughterhouses and livestock markets for Eid Al-Adha have been
approved by the Jeddah municipality.

The 8 approved livestock markets are situated close to Al-Shamali,
Al-Sabeel and Hira slaughterhouses, as well as the Central Cattle Souk. The
approved abattoirs are the Main Jeddah Slaughterhouse and the ones at
Al-Nuzha, Hira, Al-Sabeel, and the Cattle Souk.

The municipality advised customers who buy lambs from mobile salesmen to
demand an invoice for proof of purchase and contact information. The
municipality has also warned the public against the use of illegal or
unlicensed slaughterhouses.

The municipality has also marked the locations where traders can sell in
pickup vans and urged those who want to slaughter their own animals to
abide by hygienic regulations, including a veterinary examination of the
animal.

To ensure the health conditions of sacrificial animals ahead of Eid al-Adha
holiday, which is expected to fall on 17 Nov 2010, Jakarta capital city
government plans to conduct health checks on the sacrificial animals from
Dd-7 to Dd+3. A total of 750 officers will be deployed to carry out the
checks at 1577 animal shelters and 1795 slaughterhouses in Jakarta area.

Head of Jakarta Maritime and Fishery Agency, Ipih Royani, said the officers
would not only carry out health examinations on sacrificial animals but
also supervise the slaughtering process in order to ensure it runs in
accordance with the provisions of Islamic law.

Ipih disclosed that the 750 technical officers consisted of 300 people from
Bogor Agricultural University (IPB), 25 people from the Indonesian
Veterinary Association (PDHI) of Jakarta chapter, and 425 from Jakarta
Marine and Fishery Agency itself.

"We must ensure the health of all sacrificial animals. The animals must be
free from animal diseases like anthrax and PMK [Penyakit Mulu dan Kuku,
Indonesian for FMD]. In addition, the slaughtering process must also be in
accordance with the provisions of Islamic law," said Ipih Royani on Tuesday
[2 Nov 2010].

Ipih further said Jakarta Maritime and Fishery Agency had also conducted
preventive measures to guarantee all sacrificial animals distributed to
Jakarta are healthy. One of them is by stressing that each animal entering
the capital area must be provided a with written medical license from a
veterinarian in the area of origin. "As of now, we have yet identified
animals contracting both diseases. We continue to conduct monitoring," said
Ipih. "The main characteristic of a sick animal is a high body temperature
(above 40 C). We'll take the blood samples of suspected animals to be
tested in our laboratory. If tested positive of the 2 diseases, the animals
will be immediately destroyed. They should not be consumed by humans," Ipih
concluded.

[7] Jordan - imports from Ethiopia, Sudan, Romania
Date: 27 Oct 2010

Thousands of sheep will arrive from Sudan on Friday [29 Oct 2010] as part
of the National Company for Food Security's (NCFS) preparations for Eid Al
Adha sacrifices, according to the company's director.

"A total of 12 000 sheep will arrive in the Kingdom from Sudan," NCFS
Director General Wael Shqeirat told The Jordan Times over the phone on
Tuesday [26 Oct 2010], adding that 10 000 Romanian sheep have already been
imported, while 14 000 will soon be imported from Ethiopia.

President of the Consumer Protection Society (CPS) Mohammad Obeidat said
there is "ambiguity" surrounding the number of livestock to be imported,
expected around 16 Nov 2010. "Importers should provide precise figures on
the numbers of sheep they will import to ensure that the available
livestock cover the Kingdom's needs for Eid sacrifices," Obeidat told The
Jordan Times. He added that even the NCFS has not provided exact numbers of
sheep it will import ahead of Eid, and thus, the society cannot predict the
prices of sheep to be sold during the Muslim holiday.

Butchers and importers, however, denied that meat prices had risen at all,
saying that sales of red meat have been "surprisingly poor." Butchers in
Amman, Irbid and Zarqa also complained of "very low" demand for meat.

[The annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, the world's largest annual gathering,
will begin this year on 14 Nov 2010. The pilgrimage's end is marked by Eid
al-Adha (Feast of Sacrifice, also Id ul-Adha, Eidul Azha). This Muslim
3-day festival commemorates the biblical patriarch Ibrahim's (or Abraham's)
willingness to sacrifice his son Ismail (or Ishmael) in obedience to a
command from Allah. It always falls on the 10th of Dhul al-Hijja, the 12th
and final month in the Islamic calendar, and terminates on the 13th. This
year [2010], the Eid has been set to start on 16 Nov 2010.

A considerable proportion of the meat from animals slaughtered during Eid
al-Adha, which is the most important feast of the Muslim calendar, is
distributed to the needy and the poor.

The feast, celebrated throughout the world, incorporates the slaughter of
sheep, goats, cattle and camels. Their number -- in Saudi Arabia alone --
is a 7-digit figure. Obviously, the transportation and slaughtering
procedures of such numbers, within a few days, is a huge animal-health and
food-safety control undertaking everywhere. It is, though, of particular
weight in Saudi Arabia, where it is combined with the gathering of more
than 2 million pilgrims from all parts of the globe.

The biohazard, as related to animal and zoonotic diseases, is proportional
to the animal disease situation in the countries of origin. Among the
countries mentioned as exporters to Saudi Arabia and to other Middle
Eastern trade partners, subscribers would have noticed Sudan, Somali and
Ethiopia, countries which may be regarded as requiring special attention
concerning their animal disease situation.

In 2007, Rift Valley fever was one of the main concerns; fortunately, this
does not seem to be the case this year [2010], although precaution is
always in place. Among the epizootic ruminant diseases which are reportedly
endemic in the said 3 exporting countries, one will find contagious bovine
pleuropneumonia, contagious caprine pleuropneumonia, FMD, haemorrhagic
septicaemia, heartwater, lumpy skin disease, PPR, sheep pox/goat pox.

Steps to safeguard the health of slaughter-animals from these countries
should include prescribed veterinary control and surveillance activities
prior to and during their transportation, official state-controlled
quarantine facilities and -- following their importation -- full separation
from local livestock and meticulous ante- and postmortem veterinary
inspections. - Mod.AS]
