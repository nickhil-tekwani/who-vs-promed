Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks (1)
Outbreak location 1: Jerez de los Caballeros, Badajoz, Extremadura
Started: 24 Mar 2021
Ended: 16 Apr 2021
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Cattle / 45 / 1 / 0 / 8 / 0 / 0

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: on [22 Mar 2021], the Central Veterinary Laboratory received a bovine sample ref. 2021/000860 from the Laboratory of production and animal health in Cordoba (Andalusia) in order to confirm bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). The National Reference Laboratory carried out the confirmation tests authorized according to EU regulation no. 1148/2014. 2 confirmation tests were performed: BioRad immuno-blotting test TeSeE western blot and Herdcheck(R) ELISA and, subsequently, BSE strain discrimination tests were performed by hybrid immunoblotting with antibodies against PrP, which confirmed the presence of atypical BSE (H type strain). The sample was taken within the national TSE [transmissible spongiform encephalopathies] surveillance programme (sampling of dead or non-slaughtered for human consumption animals over 48 months old). The animal was a crossbred cow born on [15 Jan 2007].

Control measures applied in domestic: disinfection; selective killing and disposal; official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste; official destruction of animals products; traceability

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Laboratorio Central de Sanidad Animal (LCSA), Algete (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Cattle / Antigen detection Western blot (Ag Western blot) / 25 Mar 2021 / positive

[The following has been extracted from "Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) OIE Portal" at https://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/animal-diseases/bovine-spongiform-encephalopathy/#C

"BSE is a disease of the nervous system of cattle, which has a long incubation period of between two and eight years, and occasionally longer. There is currently no treatment or vaccine against it.

"It is one of a group of diseases known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE), or prion diseases, characterized by the accumulation in nervous tissue of an abnormal infectious protein called a prion. This group notably includes scrapie in sheep and goats, chronic wasting disease (CWD) in cervids, and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) in humans. A neurological disease in domestic and zoo felids has also been linked to BSE.

"The hypothesis that BSE prions have been passed to humans, causing vCJD, is strongly supported by epidemiological and clinicopathological studies.

"Classical versus atypical BSE
There is a distinction to be made between these 2 forms or strains:
"Classical BSE occurs through the consumption of contaminated feed (see section 'transmission and spread'). Whilst classical BSE was identified as a significant threat in the 90s, its occurrence has markedly decreased over the past years, as a result of the successful implementation of effective control measures and is now estimated to be extremely low (close to 0 cases).

"Atypical BSE refers to naturally and sporadically occurring forms, which are believed to occur in all cattle populations at a very low rate, and which have only been identified in older cattle when conducting intensive surveillance.
In the early 2000s, atypical prions causing atypical BSE were identified as the result of enhanced surveillance for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. The number of cases of atypical BSE is negligible.

"Indeed, whilst to date, there is no evidence that atypical BSE is transmissible, recycling of the atypical BSE agent has not been ruled out and therefore measures to manage exposure risk in the feed chain continue to be recommended as a precautionary measure.

"BSE is an OIE-listed disease and must be reported to the OIE, as indicated in the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code. The occurrence of atypical BSE is not considered for the purpose of official BSE risk status recognition as it can spontaneously occur in any cattle population."
