As for the recent weakening trend in soybean meal prices, pessimists
still outnumber optimists in coastal markets. Mainly, this is because
we are in the slow season for purchases by breeders, and hog disease
in the south is still striking blows on local hog markets and
affecting feed suppliers.

[Though seasonal animal health issues due to endemic, infectious or
non-infectious diseases, metabolic disturbances or environmental and
climatic factors are a possible cause for the mentioned pig market
recession in south/coastal China, major infectious diseases such as
Classical swine fever, FMD, African Swine fever, PRRS and Influenza
deserve to be excluded. Firsthand information will help. - Mod.AS]
