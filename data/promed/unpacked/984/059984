CCHF situation in Stavropol Krai stable
---------------------------------------
A total of 23 cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) have
been recorded in the Stavropol Krai, including 6 cases in the
Arzgirsky region, 4 in the Apanasenkovsky region, 3 in the each of
the Petrokumsky and the Ipatovsky regions, 2 in the each in the
Turkmen and the Andropovsky regions and a single case in the each of
the Budenovsky, Stepnovsky and Novoaleksandrovsky regions.

A total of 6175 persons have sought medical attention for tick bites,
of whom 2393 were children. In the same period of the previous year
[2008] there were 36 cases of CCH including 2 fatalities, and a total
of 5750 persons, including 1956 children, sought medical treatment
for tick bites. In total 144 people remained in hospital under
observation. The numbers of people requiring attention for tick bites
in Stavropol was 1364, followed by 468 in the Georgievsk region and
305 in the Shpakovsky region.

A survey of cases CCHF found that tick bites had been incurred during
care of cattle (9), as a consequence of removal of ticks with
unprotected hands (8), during shearing of sheep and goats (5), and as
sporadic bites associated with cattle herding, agricultural labour
and recreational activities.

A variety of preventative measures are available: treatment of
livestock with tick control preparations and tick eradication in
fields and pastures. Some 7713.1 hectares [19 060 acres] of
agricultural and recreational land have been treated.

[An increase in the prevalence of CCHF in the Stavropol Krai has been
observed over a period of years. In 2006 there were 41 cases, 63
cases in 2007, and 80 in 2008. Inadequate tick control measures,
failure of the population to observe elementary preventive rules
during work and recreation, as well as fluctuations in the tick
population have been responsible for this situation. - Mod.NP]
