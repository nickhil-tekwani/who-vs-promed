From: Henry Wilde, MD <awilde@alaska.net>

The recent news items from Kenya dealing with the ban on chloroquine are
disturbing and, we hope, will not spread to other malarious parts of the
world where chloroquine is still the drug of choice for treating vivax
malaria; this even though there is now some chloroquine resistance of vivax
malaria in a few pockets of the world.
Chloroquine is not effective for treating falciparum malaria in most of the
world, and it is ineffective in the treatment of typhus, typhoid, the flu,
etc. which is probably the reason for a good deal of the "treatment
failures" of undiagnosed fevers due to roadside sale of drugs.
None of your ProMED-mail notes stated whether the chloroquine failures were
confirmed falciparum malaria, what the current proportion of non-falciparum
malarias
are in Kenya or any other data that would justify the ban. A statement from
a responsible person from the Kenyan Ministry of Health or malaria control
division would illuminate this issue.

[Recent reports suggest that malaria caused by _P. falciparum_ is indeed
the major problem in Kenya, and that chloroquine resistance in properly
diagnosed patients from northern Kenya may fall somewhere in the range of
25-47% of cases. Approximately 74% of cases of malaria among British
soldiers attributed to training in Kenya were found to be falciparum
malaria, although these numbers may be skewed since they undoubtedly
represent principally failures of chemoprophylaxis. It is generally
recognized, as Henry Wilde has pointed out, that the over-the-counter
availability of chloroquine in Kenya results in frequent use to treat
fevers that are in fact, not malaria. The comments of subscribers with
current first-hand knowledge of the situation in Kenya would be helpful.
