In the West Kazakhstan region, more than 10 000 cattle have been
infected by brucellosis. Ural meat processing plants are in
strengthened mode. Peasants are handing over large numbers of
infected cattle. To process large quantity of meat, meat-packing
plants work in the strengthened mode also, but the prices for sausage
in shops has not decreased.

In comparison with the last [several] years, the quantity of infected
cattle has increased repeatedly. More than 230 000 heads of cattle
have been examined. The greatest quantity of infected heads of cattle
has been revealed in Dzhangalinsky, Akzhaiksky, Dzhanibeksky
districts. But, according to experts of regional territorial
inspection of the Ministry of Agriculture, it is not an epidemic.
Simply since this year [2009] more exact technique of revealing
brucellosis has begun to be applied. However conditions remain
extremely serious. An expanded meeting devoted to brucellosis, took
place in regional administration. The problem of recycling of sick
cattle became rather actual. Sanitary meat can be used after thermal
processing for manufacture of sausages and canned meat. In order to
avoid the further distribution of a dangerous infection of sick cows
it is necessary to slaughter animals, but not all peasants hurry to
cull the animals who support them. According to Farukh Mukhanov, the
main expert of territorial inspection, not in all districts the work
for reception and sending on meat-packing plants is led at an
appropriate level of sanitation.

Nevertheless, at meat-packing plants with which have been concluded
agreements for processing of infected meat, an intense situation
already has developed in connection with shortage of industrial
resources. But at such surplus of raw materials, the price for
sausage in shops, breaking all laws of economy, remain stably high.

In total in the region for last months 9 persons have already been
infected by brucellosis. In Uralsk there is a real danger to catch
this disease, buying milk on numerous, uncontrollable spontaneous
points of trade or from travelling milkmen.

[Difficult epidemiological and epizootic conditions connected with
this brucellosis outbreak have developed in a number of republics of
Central Asia, in particular, in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. On 9 Jun
2009 ProMED-RUS reported brucellosis in 30 people and 2000 cattle in
the Atyrausky area of Kazakhstan (archive no. 20090609.91293).
Among the reasons for this situation are low veterinary supervision
over agricultural animals and the sanitary-and-hygienic control of
the dairy production, insufficient volume of preventive actions, in
particular, vaccination among the persons entering into group of
risk, and agricultural animals. Improvement of quality of brucellosis
diagnostics in the republic has led to sharp growth of detectability
of this disease among animals and, as a consequence, to diagnosing it
in the people who had direct contact to them. - Mod.NP]

[Both _Brucella abortus_ and _B. melitensis_ are reportedly present
in Kazakhstan. The reservoir of _B. abortus_ is, generally, cattle
and of _B. melitensis_, goats and sheep, though cross infections may
occur. It will be helpful if the identity of the bacterium involved
in the outbreaks described becomes available. - Mod.AS]
