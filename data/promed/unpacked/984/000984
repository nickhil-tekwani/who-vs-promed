Rabies is a viral zoonotic disease prevalent almost all parts of Nepal.
Suspected rabid-dog bites is [considered 84 to 90% responsible [for cases
in human beings. Recently 3 (three) persons died due to rabies in Khamlung
and Gyaku Village development committees of Tehrathum hilly district of Far
Eastern development region of Nepal. They were bitten by a rabid dog a few
months ago but did not have rabies post exposure treatment. There were
altogether 30 persons were bitten by dogs but did not have antirabies
vaccination until the death of these three persons. Now all are looking for
vaccine, which is not available in the district hospital; 8 people could
get vaccinated but others are still looking for vaccination for that they
have been asked to go to the Zonal hospital which is about three full days
away walking on foot. No medical doctors are present in hospitals of the
hilly districts of that area. There is a severe shortage of Anti-rabies
vaccine in the country itself quite apart from the situation in the
difficult districts of Nepal.
There is a limited amount of ARV Sheep Brain Semple BPL vaccine being
produced in the Veterinary rabies project laboratory for human use but it
is not sufficient even for Kathmandu, the Capital of Nepal. The epidemic of
rabid bites is increasing in other parts of district and more mortality
could happen in future if vaccine is not supplied.
Several animals such as cattle, buffaloes, pet dogs, and community dogs
have also been bitten by rabid street dogs and some of them have already
died from rabies. There is no post exposure treatment facility in the
district veterinary hospital. Local people are requesting the concerned
ministries of His Majesty's Government of Nepal for anti rabies vaccine for
both human and animals.
This news have been published in most common news papers of Nepal like
Kathmandu Post,Kantipur, Gorakha patra, Rising Nepal also.

[As Nepal attracts many tourists, there is an additional risk that in
ignorance they might approach a sick dog in the street, be bitten, and not
realise that they were at risk, and then maybe die when they have returned
to Berlin, Paris, or Cincinnati. - Mod.MHJ
