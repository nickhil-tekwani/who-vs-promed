UPPER RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS - USA
**********************************
A ProMED-mail post
[ProMED-mail has received messages suggesting that there is an unusual
increase in emergency room visits due to upper respiratory infections. As
we ordinarily do not post information regarding increased prevalence of
influenza or other respiratory viruses, we retained these messages without
posting them. In the past days, however, we have received more messages of
the same sort. They are posted below for whatever value they may have and
in case they fit an epidemiologic pattern. - Mod.CHC]

I am writing in regards to the present situation in the Emergency
Departments of Houston and Corpus Christi, Texas. Last week even Ben Taub
Hospital, the biggest trauma center in this part of the world went on
"drive by" [no space]; that had never happened before. At one time 18
hospitals in the city of Houston were not accepting ambulance patients.
About 2-3 months ago I began seeing patients complaining of the "flu" with
mostly respiratory symptoms, some headaches, [and] some gastrointestinal
symptoms.
The most ill patients had wheezing and chest pains and lateral chest x-ray
films showed peribronchial hilar infiltrates surrounding the main bronchi
1-2 cm thick or larger. [He goes on to talk about other clinical diagnostic
features and treatment, suggesting that he was seeing a possible viral
pneumonitis he had seen before only in infants with respiratory syncytial
virus, and that the frequency with which he has seen such cases is
increasing. - Mod.CHC]

Emergency-room patients overflowed into the hallways at West Jersey
Hospital in Berlin, N.J. yesterday and ambulance cases were temporarily
diverted to other institutions as a wave of respiratory illnesses swept the
area.
In the emergency room at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania,
patient visits since around Christmas, a busy time anyway, have risen about
25%, largely due to respiratory illness, according to an attending
physician.
Children's Hospital of Philadelphia reported occupancy at 89%, compared
with an average of 76%, mostly respiratory-related cases of pneumonia,
bronchial problems and asthma, a spokeswoman said yesterday. The
Philadelphia Fire Department reported seven to 10 hospitals a day over the
past few days have asked fire rescue to temporarily divert ambulance cases
to other institutions.
The illness has not reached epidemic proportions, but shows no signs of
abating, said Dr. Herbert Patrick, of Thomas Jefferson University.
"We know what it's not, but we don't know what it is." Or where it came
from, said Patrick, an expert in respiratory illnesses. One thing doctors
do know is that it is not [infleunza] although, like influenza, it is
spread by droplets expelled by coughing or sneezing. Influenza is caused
by a virus, and viruses don't respond to antibiotics. But this respiratory
infection does respond to the antibiotic erythromycin, Patrick said.
[Lentino, above, also mentioned having used antibiotics but did not say
whether he considered that successful - Mod.CHC]. [Patrick] said the
illness appears to be caused by organisms that are "neither bacteria nor
virus. They are called atypical organisms." A possible culprit could be
chlamydia, he said. But the infecting agent is "very hard to culture," or
grow in a laboratory after a specimen has been taken from an infected
person, so researchers have not been able to identify it for sure.
"This is a very unusual outbreak, with an unusual clustering of respiratory
symptoms," Patrick said. They include sore throat, cough, difficulty
breathing and chest pains -- but not the muscle aches of the flu. The
illness also is more short-lived than flu, which takes seven to 10 days to
clear up. It usually lasts less than three to four days, Patrick said.
However, patients, still recuperating, are left vulnerable to a second
infection, a more common winter time affliction caused by bacteria.
Healthy people recover easily, but for those with chronic illnesses, such
as heart or kidney disease, or emphysema, the respiratory infection is
"double trouble," Patrick said. Patients often must be hospitalized.
West Jersey Hospital has gotten so crowded over the past few days,
according to the Chief of Emergency Medicine, "patients have been
overflowing into the hallways and double-bunked at times, admitted but
waiting to go upstairs."
He said nearby hospitals also have been crowded and have been forced
intermittently to ask ambulance crews to pass them by.

I have heard from news reports out of California that more than 500 people
have already died from a disease that has flu-like symptoms in Los Angeles
and that San Diego is also being affected. From radio reports and from
reports in newspapers there, I have learned that in San Diego people are
being told they cannot have elective surgery done until the hospitals there
can handle them, since the hospitals are filled to overflowing now with
victims of this "flu-like" disease.

As you probably heard today, the [Los Angeles County] Health Dept. says 500
people so far have died from [flu], including 9 killed by what has now been
identified as Legionnaire's Disease, which struck in Culver City and ended
with the last case reported Dec. 8.

[As is usual at this time of year, the complex epidemiologies of upper
respiratory infections become more complex and more cases are seen. When
treated with antibiotics, some patients recover. Determination of the
etiologies of the remaining illnesses is a difficult and expensive task.
Some undoubtedly are influenzavirus A H3N2 (in Los Angeles they have been
Wuhan or Wuhan-like strains or H3N2 Sydney strains but we have had no
official reports), some _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_, some due to a wide variety
of recognized viruses; some illnesses may be caused by viruses as yet
unknown. For confirmed influenza cases, it would be of interest to know
attack rates in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. Certainly there
is at least an apparent increase in emergency room admissions in various
foci and 500 deaths in one county is nothing to ignore, but until we have
attack rates comparing this year to other years, we cannot draw any
conclusions. Thanks to Joe Shea for bringing this apparent clustering to
our attention but let's wait for the experts, CDC, to do their thing before
we get too excited. I wonder whether there is an H5N1-associated hysteria
component involved in any of this. - Mod.CHC]
