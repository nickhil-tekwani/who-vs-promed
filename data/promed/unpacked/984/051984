Veterinary blunders have threatened the health of the racing industries in
Hong Kong and Australia, seriously embarrassing the Government and the Hong
Kong Jockey Club and left quarantine protocols with Australia hanging in
the balance.
The former David Hayes-trained Casa Grande was recently exported to
Australia despite the Jockey Club's veterinary department, and then the
relevant Government department, possessing documentary evidence he was
carrying the disease piroplasmosis, or equine babesiosis.
In its extreme form the tick-borne protozoa kills, or can cause
listlessness, fever, anemia, jaundice, colic and eye hemorrhages. At a
sub-acute level it causes anorexia, dullness, and lack of exercise
tolerance. It is believed it has not been present in Australia since 1976 -
until Casa Grande arrived.
Casa Grande was blood-tested twice for piroplasmosis before leaving for
Australia. It is known the first test came back marked "suspicious" by the
world-renowned Animal Health Trust in Newmarket, England, and the second
was a clear positive to the disease. Despite the previous tests, the
positive to piroplasmosis was only picked up once the four-year-old gelding
arrived in Australia.
Engelbrecht-Bresges confirmed that 350 horses were blood tested on Tuesday
as the Jockey Club attempts to prove to the racing world Hong Kong remains
a piroplasmosis-free area, Casa Grande notwithstanding. The blood tests
were immediately dispatched to the Animal Heath Trust where 75 per day can
be analysed.
The first results will be known next week. The Club has vowed to test all
1538 horses at Sha Tin and in its riding schools. One of the main thrusts
of Engelbrecht-Bresges' keynote speech to the recent Asian Racing
Conference in Singapore was "to restructure the existing quarantine
regulations for our top international horses". It remains to be seen
whether any restructuring can occur. Anything that can be salvaged will
depend on the results of the blood tests. While piroplasmosis cannot be
passed directly from horse to horse, 1 of the 3 tick families capable of
transmitting the disease -rhipicephalus - is present in Hong Kong and
responsible for the endemic canine version of the disease.
Piroplasmosis is common in Africa, where it is carried by zebras as well as
horses, and it is in South Africa that Casa Grande raced before joining the
Hayes stable. He was screened for piroplasmosis in America before coming
here, but the screening is nowhere near as thorough as a blood test.
The horse will now be put down in Australia.
