Five people hospitalized with anthrax in southern Kazakhstan have had
their diagnosis confirmed, the Kazakh emergencies ministry said
Friday [12 Sep 2008]. The patients, from a village in the Zhambyl
Region, were hospitalized a week ago.

"Laboratory tests have confirmed the diagnosis," the emergencies
ministry press service said, adding that the patients were in
satisfactory condition and that people they had come into contact
with were being closely watched.

Measures are being taken to prevent an epidemic in the region.

Outbreaks of anthrax are relatively common in the Central Asian
state. Owners of sick cattle have been known to sell meat from
infected animals after culling them, bypassing veterinary checks.

At least 2 people died of anthrax in Kazakhstan last summer [2007].

["Owners of sick cattle have been known to sell meat from infected
animals." Unfortunately, this happens constantly in Central Asia and
Russia. This disease is most common in the swath of the southern
border oblasts of Kazakhstan and is primarily of strains
geographically associated with the historic Old Silk Road. - Mod.MHJ]
