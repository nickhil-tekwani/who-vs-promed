Case of Lassa fever imported into Germany from Sierra Leone
-----------------------------------------------
A 68-year-old man who recently traveled from Sierra Leone to Germany
via Belgium has been diagnosed with Lassa fever [1].
The patient had a history of progressive neurological deterioration
over several months in Sierra Leone. On 5 Jul 2006, he developed high
fever and his neurological symptoms worsened. On 10 Jul 2006, the
patient traveled by air from Freetown (Sierra Leone) via Abijian
(Ivory Coast) to Brussels, Belgium. All of this journey was in the
same airplane. In Brussels, the patient changed planes for the
connecting flight to Frankfurt, where he arrived on 11 Jul 2006. [The
progressive neurologic deterioration was most likely another disease
process that the patient was undergoing and should not be interpreted
as a "chronic infection" with Lassa fever virus infection. One can't
help but wonder if his exposure to the Lassa fever virus was
iatrogenic during health care provided for the progressive neurologic
deterioration. - Mod.MPP]
Immediately after arriving, he was taken to the university hospital
in Munster. On 16 Jul 2006, the patient's condition worsened, and he
was intubated and treated in isolation. Although the patient's
clinical presentation was in accordance with his known underlying
disease, additional tests for tropical infectious diseases were
carried out. On 20 Jul 2006, IgG for Lassa virus was detected in a
cerebrospinal fluid sample and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) was positive. On 21 Jul 2006, an RNA-PCR for Lassa
virus was detected in blood, urine and sputum.
A message was posted on the confidential European Early warning and
Response System on Fri 21 Jul 2006. While the risk to co-passengers
is judged to be low, passengers on the following flights are being
traced and contacted to inform them about the risk.
SN Brussels Airlines flight SN 207 on 10 Jul 2006 from Brussels
(Belgium) via Freetown (Sierra Leone) to Abidjan (Cote d'Ivoire) in
seat rows 23 to 29
SN Brussels Airlines flight SN 207 on 10 Jul 2006 from Freetown
(Sierra Leone) via Abidjan (Cote d'Ivoire) to Brussels (Belgium) in
seat rows 23 to 29
SN Brussels Airlines flight SN 2607 on 11 Jul 2006, which departed
Brussels (Belgium) to Frankfurt (Germany) at 0630, all seats
The patient has been transferred to a special treatment center in
Frankfurt. Flight crew members as well as airplane cleaning personnel
are being contacted by public health authorities.
Since 1970, at least 16 cases of Lassa fever have been imported into
Europe or North America; in none of these has onward transmission to
another person been reported. The last reported imported case into
Europe was in 2003 in a soldier from the United Kingdom who had been
serving in Sierra Leone [2]. In 2000, a European meeting to discuss
the management of Lassa fever cases was held, after several
importations in 1999/2000 [3,4,5,6].
The World Health Organization has produced a Lassa fever fact sheet
which can be found at <http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs179/en/>.
