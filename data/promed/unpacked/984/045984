The CDC, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service, and public health officials in several states are investigating an outbreak of Shiga toxin-producing [enterohemorrhagic] (O157:H7) infections.

Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. PulseNet, the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories, is coordinated by CDC. DNA "fingerprinting" is performed on _E. coli_ bacteria isolated from ill people by using a technique called pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, or PFGE. PulseNet manages a national database of these DNA fingerprints to identify possible outbreaks.

One DNA fingerprint (outbreak strain) is included in this investigation. A total of 19 people infected with the outbreak strain of Shiga toxin-producing EHEC O157:H7 have been reported from 7 states. The majority of illnesses have been reported from states in the western USA. The number of ill people reported from each state is as follows: California (1), Colorado (4), Missouri (1), Montana (6), Utah (5), Virginia (1), and Washington (1).

Among people for whom information is available, illnesses started on dates ranging from 6 Oct 2015 to 3 Nov 2015. Ill people range in age from 5 years to 84, with a median age of 18. 57 percent of ill people are female. Five (29 percent) people reported being hospitalized, and 2 people developed hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a type of kidney failure. No deaths have been reported.

CDC and state and local public health partners are continuing laboratory surveillance through PulseNet to identify additional ill persons and to interview them.

Investigation of the Outbreak
------------------------
The epidemiologic evidence available to investigators at this time suggests that rotisserie chicken salad made and sold in Costco stores is a likely source of this outbreak. The ongoing investigation has not identified what specific ingredient in the chicken salad is linked to illness.

State and local public health officials are interviewing ill people to obtain information about foods they might have eaten and other exposures in the week before their illness started. 14 (88 percent) of 16 people purchased or ate rotisserie chicken salad from Costco.

On 20 Nov 2015, Costco reported to public health officials that the company had removed all remaining rotisserie chicken salad from all stores in the United States and stopped further production of the product until further notice.

[This is the initial CDC report on this ongoing outbreak. Again, chicken as well as turkey are unusual primary sources of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ infections in humans. It is possible that another ingredient in the chicken salad is the vehicle or that the chicken was cross-contaminated with the pathogen during or after cooking by poor kitchen hygiene. ProMED awaits more information regarding the scope and source of this ongoing outbreak. - Mod.LL
