A new study* has shown that pig viruses can cross the species barrier and
infect other animals, striking a blow to the once bright prospect of
research into transplanting pig tissue and organs to humans. A study
conducted by researchers in the United States revealed that when pig tissue
was transplanted to mice, the mice were infected with pig viruses.
Results of the study, which was published in the journal Nature, raises
concerns over the safety of pig-to-people transplants, known as
xenotransplantation, [for which techniques are being developed by several
research groups in various countries.
In Australia, a programme to transplant insulin-producing pig cells into
humans has been suspended earlier this week by the National Health and
Medical Research Council due to such safety concerns, reports The Age.
Similarly in Britain, scientists at Roslin Institute, where Dolly the sheep
was cloned, also dropped their pig-to-people transplant research due to
fear of the virus transfer.
Several companies worldwide are developing genetically engineered pigs to
meet the estimated $10 billion (US$5.9 billion) demand in the market for
animal organs because of severe shortage in human organ donors.
Pig viruses, known as PERVs, are incorporated in their DNA. PERVs are
retroviruses, a class to which HIV belongs. It has been shown in laboratory
experiments in 1997 that PERVs could infect human cells. However, it is
still not known if PERVs can harm people, but related viruses have been
known to cause leukaemia in other animals.
Scientists say although a patient in need of a transplant desperately may
have much to gain from receiving cells or organs from pigs, the viruses may
be passed on to other healthy people.
At the moment, there are no national [Australian guidelines concerning
xenotransplantation. Associate Professor Peter Collignon, an infectious
diseases expert at Canberra Hospital, said the mice study reinforced his
view that pig-to-people transplantation should not go ahead in the absence
of national guidelines because of the major risk to public health.

*[The Letter to Nature is: Infection by porcine endogenous retrovirus after
islet xenotransplantation in SCID mice, by Daniel Salomon's group, Nature
407, 501 - 504, 2000. It may be accessed at: <http://www.nature.com/cgi-
taf/DynaPage.taf?file=/nature/journal/v407/n6800/abs/407501a0_fs.html>
A key passage reads: "After transplantation into NOD/SCID (non-obese
diabetic, severe combined immunodeficiency) mice, we detect ongoing viral
expression and several tissue compartments become infected." Since it is
customary to give transplant patients immunodepressive medication to reduce
the risk of transplant rejection, this work indicates a problem. However,
another letter in the same issue of Nature reports work on cloning
'humanized' pigs, whose organs would not be rejected and whose recipients
would therefore not have to be severely immunodepressed. - Mod.JW
