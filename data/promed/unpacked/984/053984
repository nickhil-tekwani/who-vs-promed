A new case of anthrax was discovered yesterday [16 Jan 2015] in Moldova, in the town of Cihoreni, Orhei district.

According to the Food Protection Agency, the affected animal [n.o.s., probably a bovine. - Mod.MHJ] was slaughtered and the meat was to be sold in the capital market. Just before reaching the sale stalls [the meat was inspected by expert veterinarians] who found it was infected.

Family members were unaccounted for by the National Centre for Public Health, but for now they have [apparently] not complained of any specific disease symptoms.

The last case of anthrax was recorded in September 2014, in Cahul [Cahul district], where 10 people were sickened after consuming infected meat.

Anthrax is 'sporadic' in Moldova, with just the occasional reported outbreak. In 2014 there were 9 human cases, with one dying. In 2013 there were human cases, minimally 5, in Botosani and Soroca. Latterly, there was a bovine case in Riscani in 2012, none in sheep and horses, but 2 cases in pigs in 2011 in Orhei and Stefan-Voda, and a 3rd swine case in 2011 in Rezina. Or put another way, in spite of the claimed annual universal livestock vaccination, the occasional bovine case is not reported. It is butchered, and the farm pigs feed on the viscera and occasionally die; the vet is called, and anthrax gets diagnosed and reported. If there are no human cases, the outbreak goes undiagnosed and unreported.

Our thanks to Sabine for passing on this report. - Mod.MHJ
