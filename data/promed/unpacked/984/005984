Several outbreaks of tularemia around Wyoming have state health
officials cautioning hunters and recreationists to take basic precautions.
Tularemia, also known as rabbit fever or deer fly fever, typically
infects rabbits, hares and rodents. People and domestic animals can
become infected through contact with the bacteria or through bites
from deer flies.
In 2006, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department has documented rabbit
die-offs by Newcastle and near Pumpkin Buttes in northeast Wyoming,
according to wildlife disease specialist Hank Edwards. Additional
dead rabbits are being spotted across Thunder Basin National
Grassland and into other regions of Converse County.
"It's bad, but it's par for the course anytime you get a rabbit
population that high," said Game and Fish Warden Rod Lebert,
stationed in Douglas. More rabbits raise the likelihood of larger
die-offs because the animals are more concentrated.
So far, 2 people in Wyoming contracted tularemia in 2006, said Jamie
Snow, a public health veterinarian for the Wyoming Department of
Health. The 1st, a woman in Baggs, was bitten in the hand by a cat.
The feline had likely been chewing on an infected rabbit and carried
the disease on, Snow said. The woman had a "pretty severe" infection
in her hand, centered at the wound site, and has suffered some
lasting complications. The 2nd victim was a Big Horn County teenager
who came down with a high fever, body ache and chills after skinning
an infected rabbit. His illness was treated effectively with
antibiotics, Snow said.
Also in 2006, so far, 3 cats, one foal and a cottontail rabbit tested
positive for tularemia at the state veterinary lab.
Snow urged people to stay away from all sick-looking wildlife, and to
take cats and dogs to a veterinarian immediately if they notice signs
of sickness. She also promoted the normal precautions against
disease: Wear gloves when handling dead animals and wash hands well
with soap and water after contact.
The rabbit die-offs are likely to occur every year in various places,
Edwards said. "We know tularemia has been in the state for many years
... We see a pretty constant rate," he explained. Edwards' office
randomly surveys carnivores for tularemia and sees the bacteria in
about 20 to 30 percent of samples each year, although most carnivores
don't die from tularemia.
"They act as sentinels so we can see what the level of a particular
disease is in the field," Edwards said. "We see the same basic level
across the state."

[Animals are susceptible to tularemia, as this post clearly
indicates. Animals may acquire the disease through the bite of a tick
or other insect, or through consumption of an infected animal.
Incubation in most animals is approximately 10 days. Tularemia can
affect more than 250 kinds of domestic and wild mammals as well as
birds, reptiles, and fish, and of course humans. Animals can die from
the disease without treatment. Clinical signs include lethargy,
fever, anorexia and, generally, a cough. Once clinical signs are
apparent, death may be as quick as several hours to several days.
Antibiotics may successfully be used to treat the disease. - Mod.TG]
[Many cases of tularemia involve lymph node infection with
(ulceroglandular) or without (glandular) a local skin infection
draining to the lymph node. In the winter, infection tends to be
associated with rabbit hunting and in the summer, with tick or deer fly bites.
Summer cases can be associated with lawn mowers, as has been
described on Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts, are often pneumonic,
and are related to inhalation of bacilli. Unlike human plague
infection, pneumonic tularemia does not spread from person to person.
Bloodstream infection (bacteremia) can be associated with different
forms of disease or may be the only manifestation (typhoidal form).
