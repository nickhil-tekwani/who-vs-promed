A rare death and an increase in reports of a tick-borne illness has public health officials reminding Nebraskans to take care when they head outdoors. For the 1st time since 2015, a Nebraskan has died from Rocky Mountain spotted fever, said Jeff Hamik, an epidemiologist and entomologist with the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services. The man, who was in his 60s, lived in west-central Nebraska. He is believed to have contracted the disease from a tick while in the state, Hamik said.

Although the illness is associated with the Rocky Mountains, Hamik said, the illness can be contracted across a wide geographic area. That includes much of Nebraska and Iowa. Nationwide, the incidence of Rocky Mountain spotted fever has increased sharply in the past 20 years, according to the CDC.

According to the CDC, Nebraska is one of about 10 states with the highest number of cases per capita. In 2000, about 500 cases were reported nationwide. Since 2012, at least 3000 cases have occurred every year, and typically many more than that, the agency said. Rocky Mountain spotted fever is treatable but is one of the deadliest tick-related diseases if left untreated.

Shannon Vanderheiden, executive director of the West Central District Health Department, said the man was a resident of her district and his death is a reminder to monitor yourself closely in the days immediately after a tick bite. This particular tick-borne illness can move to advanced stages within 5 days, she said. The West Central District is composed of Arthur, Hooker, Lincoln, Logan, McPherson and Thomas counties. "The message I want people most to receive is that while we obviously are all dealing with COVID-19, that does not take away from other diseases that are still circulating," she said.

To protect yourself, Vanderheiden and state public health officials advise:
- Using an insect repellent with at least 20% DEET, picaridin or IR3535, or wearing permethrin-treated clothing.
- Avoiding grassy areas and wearing long-sleeved shirts, pants, socks and closed-toe shoes while in tick habitat.
- Checking for ticks on your body, clothing and pets when returning indoors, and showering within 2 hours.

[It is vital to diagnose rickettsial infection promptly to minimize morbidity and mortality. In states such as Nebraska, where the disease is somewhat less endemic than the Middle Atlantic states of North Carolina and Tennessee and the central states of Missouri and Oklahoma, it is particularly important to think of this infection.

When a female _Dermacentor_ tick harboring the organism attaches to a passing human, she usually starts low on the body after transferring from grassy vegetation or even directly or indirectly from a dog. After crawling around on clothes, seeking an appropriate cutaneous site (wearing white clothes makes a wandering tick easier to spot), she attaches and begins to feed. If the tick is not already partially fed, after attaching it generally takes 24 hours to activate and transmit the rickettsial organism. For this reason, daily or twice-daily tick checks with removal will minimize disease transmission. Ticks that attach in hairy areas such as the scalp or beard may be more difficult to find.

The presenting illness is generally nonspecific: fever, muscle pains, and headache (which is usually described as severe). The rash begins on day 3 of the illness, initially maculopapular at the wrists and ankles before becoming petechial and purpuric, involving the palms and soles as well as spreading proximally to the trunk. Purpura usually is not seen before the 6th day of illness. The mortality is indeed low if treatment (usually a tetracycline) is begun during the first 2 days of the rash or before.

Empiric treatment for this infection should always be begun in people with compatible symptoms inhabiting endemic areas during the spring and summer, even if no tick bite is known.
