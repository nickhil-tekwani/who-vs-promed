Update
------
Information [on the event in Wadi Al-Dawaser] is still scanty, but
the local Arabic dailies did report yesterday [14 Aug 2007] an
increase in fatalities (about 850) and morbidity (more than 1400). [A
published] picture showed a dead camel in lateral recumbency in what
seemed like blood on the ground around it.

[The described picture adds to the confusion. In view of the reported
unusual scope of the losses, an official investigation and its
results are anticipated. Special attention is required to exclude
public-health hazards of toxicological or infectious nature,
including anthrax. - Mod.AS].
