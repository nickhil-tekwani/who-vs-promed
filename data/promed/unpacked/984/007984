Over the last few days, at least a half dozen of patients were found to be contracted with _vibrio parahaemolyticus_ presenting with acute watery diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and mild fever to Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital in Kathmandu, Nepal. _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ was identified using stool culture followed by biochemical reaction methods.

In 2016, _V. parahaemolyticus_ was isolated from a patient with acute watery diarrhea and vomiting in Kathmandu [ProMED-mail archive http://www.promedmail.org/post/20160525.4242624]. Since it is not a reportable disease in Nepal, the exact scenario of _V. parahaemolyticus_ is not accurately known, though Rai et al. isolated vibrio species including _V. parahaemolyticus_ from sewage of the Kathmandu valley during June-September in 2008 (1).

[ProMED thanks Dr Pun for this posting.

Regarding the presence of a non-cholera _Vibrio sp._ in Nepal, a landlocked country, it is certainly the case that most of the cases are reported in countries with seashore so that there is easy access to the environment where these halophilic vibrios exist. It is possible that imported seawater or shellfish were responsible for this outbreak. In the reference cited above, however, there is a report from Nepal of non-cholera vibrios being isolated from sewage of the Kathmandu Valley. Of the 42 positive samples, 27 were _V. cholerae_ but 11 were _V. vulnificus_, 5 were _V. parahaemolyticus_. Species furnissi, fluvalis and alginolyticus were also isolated. - Mod.LL
