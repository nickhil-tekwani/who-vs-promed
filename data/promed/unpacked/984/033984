>From the Australian perspective, it is strange to see the assertion at the
head of this message implying that fluoroquinolones are now first line
agents for pneumococcal respiratory tract infection when betalactam
resistance is present. It should be pointed out that pharmacodynamic
parameters of betalactam action (time above MIC) in non-neurological sites
indicate very adequate theoretical coverage with penicillin G or ampicillin
at usual dose for betalactam-resistant pneumococci with MICs up to 2mg/L.
Furthermore, clinical and bacteriological data from middle ear puncture
studies [Craig W, Ped Inf Dis J 1996; 15: 255-9 and the Barcelona
pneumonia study [Pallares R, New Engl J Med 1995; 333:474-80 indicate no
significant fall off in action in patients with resistance at levels below
2mg/L. Penicillin G 1.2g 6 hourly remains the first line drug for
pneumococcal lung infection even in the presence of 'resistance'. Third
generation cephalosporins offer no particular advantage in this regard
despite assertions to the contrary by their manufacturers.
Fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin have never been accepted in
Australia as a good therapeutic alternative for pneumococcal respiratory
infection in view of poor penetration and relatively high MIC levels.
Certainly later generation quinolones are effective, however given
continuing effectiveness of simple betalactams and the usefulness of
quinolones in other difficult infections, they are not accepted as first
line agents for respiratory infection in Australia.

[The abstract that I summarized for the prior posting in this thread [NEJM,
Vol. 341, No.4, July 22,1999, pp233-239 referred to ciprofloxacin only
with regard to antimicrobial susceptibility testing, so I presume that it
was viewed as the prototype fluoroquinolone for this purpose. The full
text indicates that levofloxacin, grepafloxacin and trovafloxacin would be
better choices for therapy of pneumococcal infections. Three references
are cited for the use of fluoroquinolones for community acquired pneumonia
(CAP). One of them [Simor et al., Chest 115 Suppl 3:14S-18S, 1999
presents the Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines for empiric
treatment of CAP which include options of macrolides, doxycycline, or
fluoroquinolones as primary agents for empiric therapy. Of course, empiric
therapy is designed to cover for organisms other than pneumococci as well.
Dr. Ferguson raises some interesting points concerning the Australian
experience. It is apparent that therapeutic recommendations and practices
for CAP do not exhibit global uniformity. - Mod.ES
