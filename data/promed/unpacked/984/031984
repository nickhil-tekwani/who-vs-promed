Human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus - update, 3 Mar 2014
-----------------------------------------------
On [27 Feb, 28 Feb and 1 Mar 2014], the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) of China notified WHO of 8 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus.

Details of the cases reported on [27 Feb 2014] are as follows:

A 2-year-old girl from Jinhua City, Zhejiang Province. She became ill on [23 Feb 2014], was hospitalised on [25 Feb 2014] and has a mild illness. The patient has a history of exposure to live poultry.

A 65-year-old woman from Guangzhou City, Guangdong Province. She became ill on [17 Feb 2014], was hospitalised on [24 Feb 2014] and is currently in a critical condition. The patient has a history of exposure to live poultry.

Details of the cases reported on [28 Feb 2014] are as follows:

A 42-year-old man from Huaian City, Jiangsu Province. He became ill on [15 Feb 2014], was hospitalised on [26 Feb 2014] and is currently in a severe condition. The patient has a history of exposure to live poultry.

A 77-year-old man from Yongzhou City, Hunan Province. He became ill on [20 Feb 2014], was hospitalised on [25 Feb 2014] and is currently in a critical condition. The patient has a history of exposure to live poultry.

A 41-year-old man from Yongzhou City, Hunan Province. He became ill on [17 Feb 2014], was admitted to a hospital on [24 Feb 2014] and is currently in a critical condition. The patient has a history of exposure to live poultry.

Details of the cases reported on [1 Mar 2014] are as follows:

A 7-year-old girl from Jinhua City, Zhejiang Province. She became ill on [26 Feb 2014], was hospitalised on [27 Feb 2014] and is currently in a severe condition. The patient has a history of exposure to live poultry.

A 6-year-old girl from Jinhua City, Zhejiang Province. She became ill on [26 Feb 2014], was hospitalised on [27 Feb 2014] and is currently in a severe condition. The patient has a history of exposure to live poultry.

A 32-year-old man from Fuchuan County, Guangxi Province. He became ill on [20 Feb 2014], was hospitalised on [26 Feb 2014] and is currently in a severe condition.

The Chinese government has taken the following surveillance and control measures:

- strengthen surveillance and situation analysis;
- reinforce case management and treatment; and
- conduct risk communication with the public and release information;

Sporadic human cases
The overall risk assessment has not changed (see WHO Risk Assessment under "Related links").

While the recent report of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus detection in live poultry exported from mainland China to Hong Kong SAR shows the potential for the virus to spread through movement of live poultry, at this time, there is no indication that international spread of avian influenza A(H7N9) has occurred. However, as the virus infection does not cause signs of disease in poultry, continued surveillance is needed.

Further sporadic human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) infection are expected in affected and possibly neighbouring areas.

Should human cases from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during or after arrival. If this were to occur, community level spread is unlikely as the virus does not have the ability to transmit easily among humans. Until the virus adapts itself for efficient human-to-human transmission, the risk of ongoing international spread of H7N9 virus by travellers is low.

WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms, or contact with animals in live bird markets, or entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions.

As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.

WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI), and to carefully review any unusual patterns in order to ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005) and continue national health preparedness actions.

South China's Guangdong Province reported a new case of human infection with the H7N9 virus on Monday [3 Mar 2014], with the patient having died on Sunday [2 Mar 2014].

The man was confirmed to have contracted the bird flu virus on Sunday [2 Mar 2014]. He had chronic bronchitis and died of organ failure later that day, according to local health authorities.

Guangdong also reported 3 H7N9-related deaths at the end of February [2014]. However, 2 H7N9 patients in the province were discharged from hospitals over the weekend.

Across the country, the H7N9 strain of bird flu has infected more than 120 people and killed 36 of them so far this year [2014].

The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) yesterday [1 Mar 2014] received notification of an additional human case of avian influenza A(H7N9) in Hunan from the National Health and Family Planning Commission. The case in Hunan involves a man aged 32 who is currently hospitalised for treatment.

As of yesterday [1 Mar 2014], a total of 370 human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) have been confirmed in the mainland, including Zhejiang (138 cases), Guangdong (81 cases), Jiangsu (42 cases), Shanghai (41 cases), Fujian (20 cases), Hunan (17 cases), Anhui (9 cases), Jiangxi (6 cases), Beijing (4 cases), Henan (4 cases), Guangxi (3 cases), Shandong (2 cases), Guizhou (1 case, imported from Zhejiang), Hebei (1 case) and Jilin (1 case).

"Locally, enhanced disease surveillance, port health measures, and health education against avian influenza are ongoing. We will remain vigilant and maintain liaison with the World Health Organization (WHO) and relevant health authorities. Local surveillance activities will be modified upon the WHO's recommendations," a spokesman for the DH remarked.

"In view of the human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) confirmed in Hong Kong and multiple cases notified by the mainland, the activity of the virus is expected to be higher in the winter season. Those planning to travel outside Hong Kong should maintain good personal, environmental, and food hygiene at all times," the spokesman urged.

"All boundary control points have implemented disease prevention and control measures. Thermal imaging systems are in place for body temperature checks of inbound travellers. Random temperature checks by handheld devices have also been arranged. Suspected cases will be immediately referred to public hospitals for follow-up investigation," the spokesman added.

Meanwhile, health education for travellers, distribution of pamphlets, display of posters in departure and arrival halls, in-flight public announcements, environmental health inspection, and provision of regular updates to the travel industry via meetings and correspondence are all proceeding.

The spokesman advised travellers, especially those returning from avian influenza-affected areas and provinces, with fever or respiratory symptoms to immediately wear masks, seek medical attention, and reveal their travel history to doctors. Health-care professionals should pay special attention to patients who might have had contact with poultry, birds, or their droppings in affected areas and provinces.

Members of the public should remain vigilant and take heed of the preventive advice against avian influenza below:

- Do not visit live poultry markets and farms. Avoid contact with poultry, birds and their droppings. If contact has been made, thoroughly wash hands with soap;

- Avoid entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with surfaces which might be contaminated by droppings of poultry or other animals;

- Poultry and eggs should be thoroughly cooked before eating;

- Wash hands frequently with soap, especially before touching the mouth, nose or eyes, handling food or eating; after going to the toilet or touching public installations or equipment (including escalator handrails, elevator control panels and door knobs); or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing;

- Cover the nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing, hold the spit with a tissue and put it into a covered dustbin;

- Avoid crowded places and contact with fever patients; and

- Wear masks when respiratory symptoms develop or when taking care of fever patients.

The public may visit the CHP's avian influenza page (This link will open in a new window http://www.chp.gov.hk/en/view_content/24244.html) and website (This link will open in a new window http://www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/global_statistics_avian_influenza_e.pdf) for more information on avian influenza-affected areas and provinces.
