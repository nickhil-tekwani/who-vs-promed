Viet Nam Finds New Case of Bird Flu, Contains It
-----------------------------------------------
Bird flu has broken out in Viet Nam more than a month after an
outbreak that killed 16 people was declared over. The latest outbreak
of the deadly H5N1 bird flu virus was found on a farm in the south of
the country. It has been successfully contained, a senior agriculture
official was quoted as saying on Thursday.
"There is an outbreak in Dong Thap," Bui Quang Anh, director of the
Agriculture Ministry's animal health department, told the state-run
Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper, referring to a southern province.
"After it was spotted, the outbreak was contained. Dead chickens have
been treated to ensure the disease does not spread," he said.
Bird flu erupted across many parts of Asia beginning in late 2003 and
killed millions of chickens and devastated poultry industries in
several countries. It also killed 24 people -- 16 in Viet Nam and 8
in Thailand.
Viet Nam had declared itself free of the disease on 30 Mar 2004.
Thailand has twice delayed declaring itself free, most recently after
a new outbreak was found on 19 Apr 2004.
A representative of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization in
Vietnam said the new outbreak was not a surprise.
The area where the outbreak was detected should be immediately
isolated and the situation should be carefully controlled, said FAO
official, Anton Rychener.
Agriculture Minister Le Huy Ngo was also cautious.
"The risk of bird flu re-occurrence in Vietnam is very high," he was
quoted by Tuoi Tre as saying.

[Indeed not a surprise. As the FAO said earlier about the intention
of the Vietnamese government to declare freedom from avian influenza
on 30 Mar 2004: "it's premature, but it's a political decision. In
case there are more outbreaks, which there almost certainly will be,
it will undermine the credibility of the government." (see ref
20040330.0867, including commentary). On top of that, according to
OIE's International Animal Health Code, a country which applies
stamping-out policy can be declared free of HPAI only 6 months after
the complete eradication of its last outbreak. If stamping-out has
not been applied, the period becomes 3 years. For more details see
commentary to ref 20040420.1095. - Mod.AS]
