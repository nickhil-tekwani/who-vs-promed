Horse put down after showing signs of EEE
-----------------------------------------
A horse in Exeter that had eastern equine encephalitis [EEE] has been
euthanized. State environmental officials say the 5 month old animal was
put down on Sunday [4 Oct 2009] after displaying neurological symptoms of
the disease, and positive test results for EEE were confirmed Friday [9 Oct
2009]. Officials say the animal had not been vaccinated against the
disease. It was the 2nd horse death from EEE in Rhode Island this fall
[2009]. There have been no human cases in the state.

Horse owners are advised to inspect their barns for mosquito breeding areas
and use repellants. Symptoms can include stumbling, partial paralysis, and
muscle twitching.

Also on Friday [9 Oct 2009], state officials said test results from 39
mosquito pools all tested negative for both West Nile virus and EEE.

[This has been a year that has struck horse owners on the eastern coast of
the US particularly hard. They have had a cooler than normal summer season
with an abundance of rain. That rain has formed a multitude of pools, which
can serve as breeding areas for mosquitoes.

While not every year is as difficult at this one, it should serve as a
reminder, regardless of weather, to protect your animals with a vaccination
program. - Mod.TG
