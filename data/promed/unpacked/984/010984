600 Sickened After Eating at N.Y. Bar
---------------------------------------------
At least 600 people came down with a gastrointestinal illness after
eating at a popular biker bar and restaurant, health officials said
on Friday [1 Dec 2006].
Bacteria have been ruled out as the cause, meaning last weekend's
outbreak linked to the Dinosaur Bar-B-Que is probably viral and could
have spread through air particles, said Cynthia Morrow, health
commissioner of Onondaga County.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were notified because
the people who may have been affected were from across the country,
Morrow said. Patrons from as far away as Massachusetts, New Jersey,
Vermont and California have reported symptoms.
Some were sickened after eating at the restaurant, while others
became ill after being exposed to those who had, health officials said.
The most common symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
abdominal cramps and chills lasting 12 to 48 hours.
The county health department on Thursday [30 Nov 2006] ordered the
restaurant closed for at least 72 hours. Workers threw away hundreds
of pounds of prepared foods. No specific foods have been implicated.
Restaurant owner John Stage said he planned to reopen on Monday [4 Dec 2006].

[The association of such a large outbreak of presumptive viral
gastroenteritis with a single restaurant and subsequent spread of
gastroenteritis among contacts of those present at the restaurant
suggests that the agent responsible may be a norovirus. Noroviruses
are highly infectious ubiquitous viruses that can be transmitted both
from contaminated produce and also directly from person-to-person.
Outbreaks associated with restaurants have been frequent in the past,
but are less common now as a result of greater awareness of the
problem and general improvements in food processing and handling.
Outbreaks are more common now in situations where unrelated
individuals congregate together at high density; e.g. in schools, in
hospitals, on board cruise ships, etc. - Mod.CP]
