Indonesia confirms anthrax case, orders isolation
-----------------------------------------------
Blood tests have confirmed that anthrax caused the deaths of 6 people,
after they ate meat from a sick goat, Indonesia's agriculture ministry said
on Mon 25 Oct 2004. 6 Bogor area villagers, 5 of them related, died after
consuming the meat contaminated by anthrax last week. 6 were being treated
on Monday [25 Oct 2004] in the hospital. [The latter are possibly those
persons who consumed the soup. - Mod.MHJ]
The government has distributed 300 000 doses of vaccine across the nation
to prevent the disease from spreading and has warned people to report
immediately to health facilities if they notice any early symptoms or see
them in livestock, said the ministry's director-general of animal
husbandry, H.R. Wasito. "We have ordered isolation and banned inter-region
transportation of livestock from Babakan," Wasito said, referring to the
affected area in the Bogor region 60 km south of Jakarta. The isolation
period is set for the next 3 months, said Wasito.
Anthrax is endemic in several provinces in Indonesia, including West Java,
Central Java, Yogyakarta, South Sulawesi, Central Sulawesi, Southeast
Sulawesi, and East Nusa Tenggara, he said. Sporadic outbreaks occurred in 2001.

[Thanks to Paul Cheek for this information. The disease is already
widespread in Indonesia. The best protection in these circumstances is a
structured control program with annual vaccination, where cases continue to
occur, and compulsory notification of all unexpected livestock deaths. Once
stock are vaccinated, and sufficient time has been allowed for protection
to develop (14 days is a safe round number), livestock movement of
vaccinated animals can be safely permitted. However, when restrictions are
onerous, farmers are tempted to ignore them, and since ignoring these
restrictions is illegal, violations happen covertly, and no one then knows
what is going on. Also, if stock get sick, the illnesses will be hidden,
because the farmers know that, upon questioning, it will come out that they
had disobeyed the rules, which will result in fines or worse.
The whole art of disease regulation is that it must be perceived to be
fair, sensible, and correct. Regulation then has wide support and
self-policing. With community awareness, regulation is successful because,
if a neighbor does something illegal, he knows he will be reported. - Mod.MHJ]
