---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yam (_Dioscorea_ spp., family _Dioscoreaceae_) is one of the most
important food crops cultivated in the West African yam zone
comprising the forest and savannah areas of Nigeria, Ghana, Cote
d'Ivoire, Republic of Benin, and Togo, which account for more than 90
percent of the 4.59 million ha [11.34 million acres] of yam
cultivation worldwide.

A survey was conducted in 2005 to document viruses in yams in Ghana,
Togo, and the Republic of Benin. Samples (1405) from 5 species of yam
showing mosaic, chlorosis, and stunting as well as asymptomatic
plants were tested for _Dioscorea bacilliform virus_ (DBV, genus
_Badnavirus_), _Yam mosaic virus_ (YMV, genus _Potyvirus_), and _Yam
mild mosaic virus_ (YMMV, genus _Potyvirus_), the 3 most common
viruses infecting yams. In addition, samples were tested for
_Cucumber mosaic virus_ (CMV), since CMV was previously reported to
infect yams in Cote d'Ivoire and Nigeria.

In protein-A sandwich-ELISA [enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay] with
polyclonal antibodies to a cowpea isolate of CMV, 23 of the 1405
samples (6 of 218 samples from Togo, 13 of 628 samples from Ghana,
and 4 of 559 samples from Republic of Benin) tested positive for CMV.
The CMV-positive samples were from _D. alata_ (16 samples) and _D.
rotundata_ (7 samples), whereas all samples from _D. cayenensis_, _D.
dumetorum_, and _D. bulbifera_ tested negative. CMV was detected as
mixed infections with DBV, YMV, or YMMV in 21 of 23 samples. Some of
these samples showed puckering, chlorosis, mottling, and crinkling,
whereas some plants infected by 2 or more viruses were asymptomatic.
Only 2 samples from _D. rotundata_ had a single infection of CMV and
they showed mild chlorotic symptoms in young leaves that were
inconspicuous in mature leaves.

In sap inoculations, the virus induced systemic mosaic in _Nicotiana
glutinosa_ [a diagnostic host - Mod.DHA]. The presence of CMV was
further confirmed by immunocapture-reverse transcription (IC-RT)-PCR
[polymerase chain reaction] using CMV antibodies for trapping and
primers specific for a 485 nucleotide sequence corresponding to the
3' end of the coat protein gene and the C-terminal noncoding region
of RNA-3. To confirm the specificity of IC-RT-PCR, the 485 bp
amplicons from an isolate from the Republic of Benin was cloned and
sequenced. Comparison with other CMV isolates deposited in GenBank
[database] showed 99 percent identity of nucleotide sequence and
revealed that the CMV isolate from yam belongs to sub-Group IA.

To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of CMV infection in yams
(_D. alata_ and _D. rotundata_) in Ghana, Togo, and the Republic of
Benin. Together with a previous documentation of CMV in _D. alata_
and _D. trifida_ in Cote d'Ivoire and Nigeria, this report adds to
existing knowledge on distribution of CMV in yams with implications
for yam production and germplasm distribution in the West Africa
Region.

[Yam (_Dioscorea_ spp.) is an important tuber crop in Africa, the
West Indies, and parts of Asia and southern America. Viruses of the
genera _Potyvirus_, _Potexvirus_, _Badnavirus_, _Cucumovirus_ and
_Carlavirus_ are known to infect yams of different species worldwide
causing a range of symptoms including mosaics, mottle, vein clearing,
chlorosis, stunting, and distortion. They may lead to a chronic and
sometimes severe disease situation. In sub-Saharan Africa, _Yam
mosaic virus_ (YMV, genus _Potyvirus_), _Dioscorea alata virus_ (DAV,
genus _Potyvirus_), _Dioscorea alata bacilliform virus_ (DaBV, genus
_Badnavirus_), _Dioscorea dumetorum virus_ (DdV, genus _Potyvirus_),
Dioscorea mottle virus (DMoV, possible member of genus _Comovirus_),
as well as _Cucumber mosaic virus_ (CMV, type member of genus
_Cucumovirus_) have been recorded in yams.

CMV is found worldwide affecting a large number of hosts (around 190
recorded species) including many crops. It is transmitted by several
species of aphid vectors and can also be spread by mechanical means
and with infected plant material. The virus may also be seed
transmitted in some hosts to variable degrees. CMV has a tri-partite
genome and exists in numerous strains, which may vary in their
biological properties. In most hosts, it produces a systemic
infection affecting newly formed tissues. Disease management is
difficult since aphid vectors and virus reservoirs are widespread.
Host resistance is available in some crops.

Multiple viral infections, as reported above for yams, are common in
field plants, and the predominantly vegetative propagation of yam
increases the chance of a build-up of viruses. Co-infecting viruses
may interact with the potential for synergism (symbiotic enhancement)
or cross-protection (competitive suppression) between the species.
Different levels of symptom expression are being reported above for
different yams with multiple virus infections, and further work is
apparently needed to clarify epidemiology and types of interaction
for these co-infections.
