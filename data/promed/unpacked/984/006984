[The above firsthand commendable document, with current pictures of affected animals in various stages of the disease, may be helpful to those engaged in clinical disease surveillance, particularly in Middle Eastern countries, where the rather unfamiliar lumpy skin disease is suspected to be circulating, and early diagnosis is essential for timely control measures.

The Israeli Veterinary Services have notified the OIE about the outbreak; see immediate notification at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=12157.

Concerning vaccination, we are informed that the vaccine applied in Israel is the live-attenuated freeze-dried vaccine, strain RM-65. This strain has been shown in the past to be efficient and safe in cattle. This is contrary to the KSGP 0240 (sheep and goat) strain, which may cause harmful post-vaccinal reactions in cattle, particularly in _Bos taurus_ breeds. - Mod.AS
