[This outbreak appears to have been contained successfully by prompt action
of WHO and the Republic of the Congo Ministry of Health. It will rank as
one of the smallest recorded outbreaks of Ebola hemorrhagic fever. By
contrast, the outbreak of Marburg hemorrhagic fever in Angola (caused by
another member of the family _Filoviridae_) has been extensive and more
difficult to contain, belying previous belief that Marburg virus was a less
serious threat than Ebola virus. - Mod.CP]
