-------------------------------------------------------
Key points
----------
Question: What is the association of a COVID-19 diagnosis and mobility and physical function among community-living middle-aged and older Canadians during the initial pandemic lockdown in 2020?
Findings: This cohort study of 24 114 participants found that community-living middle-aged and older adults with confirmed, probable, or suspected COVID-19 had nearly 2-fold higher odds of worsening mobility and physical function compared with adults without COVID-19, although most participants with COVID-19 had mild to moderate disease and were not hospitalized.
Meaning: These findings suggest that individuals with mild and moderate COVID-19 who were predominantly not hospitalized experienced deficits in functional mobility compared with those without COVID-19.

Abstract
--------
Importance: The association of COVID-19 not requiring hospitalization with functional mobility in community-dwelling adults above and beyond the impact of the pandemic control measures implemented in 2020 remains to be elucidated.
Objective: To evaluate the association between a COVID-19 diagnosis and change in mobility and physical function of adults in Canada aged 50 years or older during the initial pandemic lockdown.
Design, setting, and participants: This population-based cohort study used data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA) COVID-19 study. This study was launched on [15 Apr 2020], and the exit questionnaires were completed between September and December [2020]. Prepandemic data from the 1st CLSA follow-up (2015-2018) were also used. Respondents included middle-aged and older community-dwelling participants residing in Canadian provinces. Data were analyzed from February to May [2021].
Exposures: The assessment for self-reported COVID-19 status was adapted from the Public Health Agency of Canada and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention case definition available at the time of data collection; cases were classified as confirmed or probable, suspected, or non-COVID-19.
Main outcomes and measures: Changes in mobility since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic were assessed using global rating of change in mobility scales at the COVID-19 exit questionnaire. Participant-reported new onset of difficulty in 3 physical function tasks was also examined.
Results: Among 51 338 participants at baseline, 21 491 participants (41.9%) were 65 years or older and 26 155 participants (51.0%) were women and 25 183 (49.1%) were men. Of 2748 individuals with confirmed or probable or suspected COVID-19, 113 (94.2%) were not hospitalized. Individuals with confirmed or probable COVID-19 had higher odds of worsening mobility in terms of ability to engage in household activity (odds ratio [OR] 1.89; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11-3.22), physical activity (OR 1.91; CI 1.32-2.76), and standing up after sitting in a chair (OR 2.33; CI 1.06-5.11) compared with adults without COVID-19 during the same pandemic time period. Similar results were found for suspected COVID-19 status (for example, household activity: OR 2.09; CI 1.82-2.41).
Conclusions and relevance: This cohort study among older adults in Canada found that receiving a COVID-19 diagnosis was significantly associated with worse mobility and functioning outcomes even in the absence of hospitalization. These findings suggest that interventions may be needed for individuals with mild to moderate COVID-19 who do not require hospitalization.

[2] Diagnostic breath test

A Tampere-based medical devices company has received an European Union-wide CE certificate for the distribution of a rapid COVID-19 breath test. CE marking indicates that a product has been assessed and deemed to meet EU safety, health, and environmental protection requirements.

"We are driven to provide a disruptive [sic] COVID-19 screening solution that helps individuals, families, and communities return to normal at work, school, and play," CEO Pekka Rissanen of Deep Sensing Algorithms, which developed the product, said in a press release. Test subjects blow into the handheld device, where nanosensors analyse their breath. The data is then sent via a mobile app to a cloud-based service which provides a test result within about 45 seconds. "The human defence mechanisms start immediately after the infection, and the metabolic byproducts of the person's immune response start to appear in exhaled breath within the same day," the company explained in the statement.

The device is manufactured in Turku, but the quantity produced will depend on orders. The breathalyser must be used by a professional as it is officially a medical device. "Occupational healthcare, school healthcare, and dental care would be good places for the device," Rissanen said.

[3] Respiratory virus interference

ref: Piret J, Boivin G. Viral interference between respiratory viruses. Emerg Infect Dis. 2022; 28: (2); https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2802.211727.
------------------------------------------------------------------
"Abstract
---------
Multiple respiratory viruses can concurrently or sequentially infect the respiratory tract and lead to virus-virus interactions. Infection by a first virus could enhance or reduce infection and replication of a second virus, resulting in positive (additive or synergistic) or negative (antagonistic) interaction. The concept of viral interference has been demonstrated at the cellular, host, and population levels. The mechanisms involved in viral interference have been evaluated in differentiated airway epithelial cells and in animal models susceptible to the respiratory viruses of interest.

"A likely mechanism is the interferon response that could confer a temporary nonspecific immunity to the host. During the coronavirus disease pandemic, nonpharmacologic interventions have prevented the circulation of most respiratory viruses. Once the sanitary restrictions are lifted, circulation of seasonal respiratory viruses is expected to resume and will offer the opportunity to study their interactions, notably with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

"Several respiratory viruses can circulate during the same period and can concurrently or sequentially infect the respiratory tract, leading to virus-virus interactions. At the host level, the course of infection of one virus might be influenced by prior or concurrent infection by another virus. Infection by a first virus could enhance or reduce infection and replication of a 2nd virus, resulting in positive (additive or synergistic) or negative (antagonistic) interaction.

"Positive virus-virus interaction corresponds to a co-infection that might result in an increased disease severity and pathogenesis (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2] and influenza A[H1N1]pdm09 virus) (1). Negative virus-virus interaction can be homologous or heterologous depending on whether the 2 viruses belong to the same family or to different serotypes or families. Homologous virus-virus interaction implies that cross-reactive immunity against a 1st virus prevents infection with a 2nd virus (e.g., among different influenza subtypes or lineages) (2). Heterologous viral interference relies on induction of a nonspecific innate immune response by a 1st virus that reduces or prevents infection and replication of a 2nd virus (e.g., influenza A virus [IAV] and respiratory syncytial virus [RSV]) (3). The type of virus-virus interaction (negative or positive) is probably dependent on the respiratory viruses involved, the timing of each infection, and the interplay between the response of the host to each virus. In this perspective, we focus more specifically on viral interference."

"Conclusions and perspectives
----------------------------
Recent viral infections of the respiratory tract might induce a refractory period during which the host is less likely to be infected by another respiratory virus. This viral interference requires closely spaced virus co-exposures, implying that both viruses share common ecologic conditions for example, cold weather). Factors that could predict an interference between respiratory viruses include the capacity of the interfering virus to induce a rapid IFN response; the degree of susceptibility of the second virus to immune mediators; the extent to which the different viruses counteract the induction and antiviral effects of IFN; and the differential innate immune response patterns triggered by each virus in the upper and lower respiratory tracts.

"The duration of the refractory period at the host level has not been determined but might correspond to the period of virus shedding and the associated transient innate immune response. Mathematical models that simulate the co-circulation of seasonal IAV and HRV confirmed that the temporary immunity provided by an IFN response might be sufficient to produce the asynchronous epidemic peaks recorded for these 2 viruses (12). At the population level, the concept of viral interference corresponds to an ecologic phenomenon in which the epidemic caused by one virus delays the start or advances the end of the epidemic caused by another virus.

"These episodes are difficult to demonstrate because the transmission dynamics of respiratory viruses might be influenced by social behaviors for different age groups. The contact rate between persons might also vary according to different periods of the year, such as during school opening and closing. Furthermore, a large proportion of respiratory infections are asymptomatic and do not require testing, thus excluding this part of the population from studies. Environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity can be confounding factors for viral interference. Prospective epidemiologic studies enabling detection of multiple respiratory viruses in serial nasopharyngeal swab specimens of participants over several epidemic periods would enable demonstration of viral interference. The type of interaction between respiratory viruses producing distinct epidemic peaks should be then confirmed by evaluating their likelihood of co-detection in patients, as well as the mechanisms involved in ex vivo and in vivo models.

"The reappearance of H1N1 virus during 1977 and the 2009-2011 pH1N1 pandemic offered the opportunity to study the epidemiologic interactions between the newly circulating virus and seasonal respiratory viruses in northern and southern hemispheres and thus strengthened the concept of viral interference. During the COVID-19 pandemic, nonpharmacologic interventions have prevented the circulation of most respiratory viruses. Therefore, their potential interactions with SARS-CoV-2 could not be determined in epidemiologic studies, except in some reports at the onset of the pandemic. A systematic review and meta-analysis showed that the more common respiratory viruses co-detected with SARS-CoV-2 were influenza viruses, RSV, and HRV (50). Once the sanitary restrictions are lifted, the circulation of seasonal respiratory viruses should resume, and different types of interactions are expected to occur.

"Mathematical modeling predicting the timing and magnitude of epidemics caused by SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal respiratory viruses might improve public health interventions to protect persons at risk for co-infection through introduction of nonpharmacologic measures, adjustment of vaccine schedules, or use of prophylactic agents. Finally, the interfering and immunostimulatory activities of DVGs make them attractive candidates for development of prophylactic broad-spectrum antiviral drugs or vaccine adjuvant, which would be based on the concept of viral interference (47)."

[4] Israel: 4th vaccine
Date: Mon 17 Jan 2022
Source: AP News [edited]
https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-middle-east-israel-5da0bbef16209e9c55e48af40248af11


An Israeli hospital on Monday [17 Jan 2022] said preliminary research suggests that a 4th dose of the coronavirus vaccine provides only limited defense against the omicron variant that is raging around the world. Sheba Hospital last month [December 2021] began administering a 4th vaccine to more than 270 medical workers, of which 154 received a Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine and 120 others received Moderna's. All had previously been vaccinated 3 times with the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine.

The clinical trial found that both groups showed increases in antibodies "slightly higher" than following the 3rd vaccine last year [2021]. But it said the increased antibodies did not prevent the spread of omicron. "Despite increased antibody levels, the 4th vaccine only offers a partial defense against the virus," said Dr Gili Regev-Yochay, director of the hospital's infection disease unit. "The vaccines, which were more effective against previous variants, offer less protection versus omicron."

The preliminary results raised questions about Israel's decision to offer a 2nd booster shot -- and 4th overall -- to its over-60 population. The government says over 500 000 people have received the 2nd booster in recent weeks.

Dr Nahman Ash, director of Israel's Health Ministry, said the research did not mean the 4th vaccine effort was a mistake. "It returns the level of antibodies to what it was at the beginning of the 3rd booster. That has great importance, especially among the older population," he told Channel 13 TV. But he said the research would be taken into account as authorities debate whether to expand the additional booster campaign to the broader population.

Israel was one of the first countries last year to widely vaccinate its population and last summer became the first to offer a booster shot. The latest booster campaign for older Israelis also is believed to be the first of its kind in the world. Israel's aggressive vaccination efforts have not been able to stop an omicron outbreak in recent weeks. The variant has caused record-setting infection levels and sent a growing number of people to the hospital, though the numbers of seriously ill remain below previous waves. It has also forced large numbers of Israelis into quarantine, straining schools and businesses.

Omicron is already dominant in many countries and can also infect those who have been vaccinated or had previously been infected by prior versions of the virus. Early studies, however, show it is less likely to cause severe illness than the previous delta variant. Vaccination and a booster still offer strong protection from serious illness, hospitalization, and death.

On Tuesday [11 Jan 2022], the Israeli government said it was shortening the mandatory quarantine period from 7 days to 5 days in order to help keep the economy running. "This decision will enable us to continue safeguarding public health on the one hand and to keep the economy going at this time on the other, even though it is difficult, so that we can get through this wave safely," said prime minister Naftali Bennett.

[In the past 24 hours, 31 countries -- the USA (635 658), Spain (331 467), India (223 605), Argentina (102 458), France (102 144), the UK (88 130), Italy (83 387), Brazil (76 345), Australia (73 793), Switzerland (67 729), Turkey (64 935), Germany (53 916), the Netherlands (42 352), Peru (43 592), Canada (41 727), Philippines (36 978), Russia (30 726), Denmark (26 965), Japan (26 881), Colombia (24 272), Finland (22 217), Portugal (21 917), Hungary (21 219), Greece (18 834), Mexico (17 101), Austria (15 717), Serbia (12 797), Norway (11 031), Ecuador (11 027), Kazakhstan (11 524), and Poland (10 446) -- all reported over 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 5688 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 15 Jan 2022 to late 16 Jan 2022). The exponential rise in cases over the last few weeks can be attributed to the rapid spread of the omicron variant globally. The 7-day averages indicate an increasing global trend for cases and deaths. A total of 75 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 41 of the 75 countries are from the European region, 9 are from the Americas region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, 5 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 4 are from the South East Asia region, and 10 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 12.5%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 11.7%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 16.8% increase in daily reported cases and 14.7% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 2.5 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 331.36 million cumulative reported cases and over 5.56 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
