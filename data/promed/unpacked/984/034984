Royal Seafood Baza Inc, located in Far Rockaway, NY is recalling packages
of "Dried Roach" (fish) because the product may be contaminated with
_Clostridium botulinum_, which can cause botulism, a serious and
potentially fatal foodborne illness.
The sale of this type of fish is prohibited under New York State Department
of Agriculture and Markets regulations because _Clostridium botulinum_
spores are more likely to be concentrated in the viscera than in any other
portion of fish. Uneviscerated fish has been linked to outbreaks of
botulism poisoning. Symptoms of botulism include blurred or double vision,
general weakness, and poor reflexes, difficulty swallowing and respiratory
paralysis.
The recalled "Dried Roach" (fish) was distributed to Net Cost Market stores
located in Brooklyn and Staten Island, New York and Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania. The product comes in clear plastic pouches of various weights
with a product code 20.03.08. It is a product of Latvia. No illnesses have
been reported to date in connection with this problem. Consumers who have
"Dried Roach" (fish) are urged to return it to the place of purchase for
full refund. Consumers with questions should contact the company at
1-888-776-3958.

The roach (_Rutilus rutilus_, family Cyprinidae, plural also roach) is a
small freshwater and brackish water fish native to most of Europe and
western Asia. It is typically a small fish, reaching 14-17 inches (35-43cm)
long and weighing 2-4 pounds (1-2kg). It is very common, and its flesh is
often enjoyed as food. This description was adapted from
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roach_(fish)> where a picture of a roach can
be found.
Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such
recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated with
the food. Most of the food recalls are related to defective preparation
procedures, which could, but not necessarily do, result in the germination
of viable spores of _C. botulinum_.
The following is abstracted from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
Regulations Section 540.650: Uneviscerated Fish Products that are
Salt-cured, Dried, or Smoked (CPG 7108.17)
<http://www.fda.gov/ora/compliance_ref/cpg/cpgfod/cpg540-650.htm>:
Uneviscerated, salt-cured, whole fish products have caused several
outbreaks of botulism and death. _C. botulinum_ spores are ubiquitous in
fishery products and the marine environment. The spores represent a public
health hazard when conditions are suitable for vegetative cell growth and
toxin production.
Three outbreaks of botulism, causing 3 deaths and 11 illnesses, resulted
from "kapchunka" in the USA between 1981 and 1987. Kapchunka, an ethnic
food usually produced from whitefish, is also known as "rybetz", "ribeyza,"
or "rostov." Kapchunka is an uneviscerated, salt-cured, air-dried, whole
fish, which may or may not be smoked. It is consumed without further
preparation, such as cooking.
The fish are salt-cured under minimum refrigeration conditions for a
minimum of 25 days and then air dried at ambient temperature for 3 to 7
days. Kapchunka may be smoked before packing and are commonly stored under
refrigeration.
In 1991, 2 botulism outbreaks occurred. In one, "faseikh" was implicated in
at least 91 illnesses and 18 deaths in Egypt. Faseikh is a traditional
product made by fermenting uneviscerated fresh mullet for up to one day and
then salt-curing it in barrels, which may be tightly sealed from one week
to one year. In another, an ethnic fish product called "moloha" caused a
botulism outbreak involving 4 family members in New Jersey. Moloha is an
uneviscerated, salt-cured fish product similar to "faseikh." The
preparation steps in the New Jersey incident were not identified since the
source of the "moloha" could not be found.
Other salt-cured products, such as "bloaters", can also pose a public
health hazard. Bloaters are prepared by salt-curing uneviscerated whole
herring, which may or may not be smoked. Bloaters may be transformed into
other products, such as fillets or bloater paste. In addition to the
products noted above, whole fish that are dried, pickled, or fermented can
also pose a public health hazard. The referenced episodes of botulism are
representative of a well-documented history of life-threatening health
hazards associated with uneviscerated, salt-cured fish.
The problems with these products are compounded by the difficulty in
attaining sufficient levels of salt in all portions of an uneviscerated
fish to inhibit the growth of _C. botulinum_. Consequently, any fish
product that is salt-cured and then dried, smoked, pickled, or fermented
can pose a public health hazard. Toxin may be present in these products
even when there are no outward signs of microbiological spoilage or other
clear indications to alert the consumer.
Control of growth and toxin production from _C. botulinum_ in fishery
products is based on spore destruction (such as retorting canned foods) or
inhibition of vegetative cell growth (such as control of water activity,
pH, or use of approved chemical inhibitors). The control measures must be
applied rapidly and uniformly throughout the product to protect consumers
from this potentially life-threatening toxin.
Control of botulism can also be achieved in salted, dried, or smoked
products prepared from small species of uneviscerated fish (generally 3 to
5 inches in length (8-13 cm)). Typically, these products are prepared from
small anchovy and herring sprats. As uneviscerated fish under 5 inches in
length are processed, their smaller size helps to ensure complete
permeation of the flesh with inhibitory levels of salt or drying to a
uniformly low water activity, resulting in the attainment of conditions
that prevent the growth of _C. botulinum_.
FDA considers uneviscerated fish that are salt-cured, dried, or smoked to
represent a potentially life-threatening health hazard. In addition,
fillets, parts, or other products derived from uneviscerated fish pose the
same potential health hazard as the original product. Therefore, with the
exception of small, uneviscerated fish as described above, FDA considers
uneviscerated fish that have been salt-cured, dried, or smoked, as well as
products made from them, to be adulterated within the meaning of section
402(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, in that the product
has been prepared, packed, or held under unsanitary conditions whereby it
may have been rendered injurious to health. These products are hazardous
whether stored at ambient temperature, refrigerated, or frozen, or whether
packaged in air, vacuum, or modified atmosphere. - Mod.LL]
