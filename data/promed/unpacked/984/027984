Yellow fever
----------------
Bolivia. Since the last report on the yellow fever outbreak in Bolivia
(1), the Ministry of Health has reported 14 additional laboratory-confirmed
cases. The last case occurred on 8 Feb 1999. The department of Santa Cruz
continues to be the only department reporting cases of yellow fever since
the beginning of the year. Similarly to the 27 cases previously reported,
the new cases are primarily being reported from the area between the
provinces of Vallegrande and Cordillera. Cases have also been reported for
the first time in the provinces of Velasco and Nuflo de Chavez. The age
distribution of the 41 cases is 81% aged over 15 years, 7% 10-15 years, and
12% under 10 years. The case-fatality rate is 34%. The government has
responded to this outbreak by immunizing individuals of all age groups in
affected areas.
