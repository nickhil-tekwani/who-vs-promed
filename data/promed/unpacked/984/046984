A dog that was being treated at Colorado State University (CSU) was diagnosed with plague and euthanized on Friday [8 Dec 2017]. The CSU Veterinary Teaching Hospital notified faculty, staff, and students on Monday [11 Dec 2017].

Local media reports that this was the 7th case of plague in a domestic animal in Colorado this year [2017].

Officials say they have taken all of the steps to directly notify anyone who may have been exposed to the bacteria, either directly at the hospital or who had animals that were also patients at the time the infected dog was hospitalized.

For those who were in contact with the infected dog, early detection of infections with this bacteria are very treatable with an antibiotic. Those who are at risk have been provided with information about how to monitor for symptoms.

A limited number of people were exposed, but as a precaution, anyone with concerns about exposure should consult with their medical care provider. If you have not received a direct contact from the Veterinary Teaching Hospital VT(H), you or your pet were not identified as being at risk for potential exposure.

This was a complex case because some of the dog's symptoms were atypical for plague. As soon as tests confirmed late Friday [8 Dec 2017] that the dog was infected with the bacteria that causes plague, the hospital took immediate steps to notify people who may have been exposed. Those steps were:

- We immediately identified and directly notified students, staff and faculty who were potentially exposed to the dog. We provided specific information about the case and proactive next steps these individuals should take.
- We immediately identified and then directly notified the owners of 59 animals (48 dogs, 10 cats and a rabbit) at the hospital that were potentially exposed via sharing space with the infected dog. We provided information about proactive next steps and best practices, which include giving these pets an antibiotic, and are providing that medication for free to these clients.
- We cleaned and disinfected the treatment areas where the dog was receiving care, following best practices recommended by experts at CSU and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.
- We notified the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, Larimer County Department of Public Health, and other regulatory agencies, and began collaborating on a response, following public health best practices and recommendations.
- Before the test confirmed the infection, the dog had been placed on a drug that would treat this infection, and would greatly reduce exposure to others after the 1st 48 hours. After the infection was confirmed, veterinarians began treating all other pets who had been in close proximity to the infected dog that were at the VTH.

Facts about _Yersinia pestis_ and plague:
- This bacterium is commonly found in rodents in Colorado, including the Fort Collins area.
- Plague is an extremely rare diagnosis in a dog.
- The timeframe for showing symptoms of illness after exposure are up to 7 days but can occur in a much shorter time frame, such as 2-3 days.
- The bacteria most commonly spread via a bite from an infected flea. Less commonly, they can spread through direct contact with body fluids or tissue from an infected person or animal, or by breathing in infected droplets from the cough of an infected person, generally limited to those with close contact.
- Plague is most common in the area during the warm months of May to September. Freezing temperatures often greatly diminish the spread.
- Public health officials have advised that the chance of infection is limited to those with direct contact with the infected animal. They recommend as a precaution that all of those potentially exposed consult with their medical care provider to discuss monitoring for fever and other signs of infection, and potential prophylactic antibiotic treatment.

[Plague may infect human beings through several routes: 1) the bite of an infected flea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals (mentioned previously; 2) direct contact with contaminated tissues, generally from an animal; or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of respiratory secretions from infected people or animals.

Clinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front leg (the armpit, if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever. These clinical signs may be present in the dog as well. Swelling under the jaw in cats is frequently mistaken as a cat fight abscess. Please take your pet to a veterinarian if you notice any abnormalities. Be sure to consult your veterinarian if you find a lump on your pet, as well as to get the best flea prevention treatment for your pet. It may be necessary to have your yard and/or home treated for fleas. Vacuum your home, including any bedding and furniture, and immediately upon finishing take the vacuum back outside, seal it in a plastic bag, and dispose of it. This type of cleaning will have to be repeated every week for 4-6 weeks to break the cycle of the flea in the home. This disease should be taken seriously, so please be sure your pet is on some form of flea prevention. - Mod.TG
