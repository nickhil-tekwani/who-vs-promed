Rice crops are threatened by an attack of "sogata" disease, a virus that reduces production up to 50 per cent. Heitel Lozano, National Corporation of Rice Farmers (Corpoarroz), raised the alarm: plants are affected in the provinces of Guayas and Los Rios.

During the rainy season, growers use varieties that are the most susceptible to the attack of this disease. "There are some (varieties) which are resistant, but Iniap 14 and 15, which are the most widely sown, are moderately resistant; with these weather problems, they begin to be very susceptible," said Lozano.

This is a major problem, because the [yield] reduction will affect the economy, since rice is the most consumed product in the country.

[Rice hoja blanca virus (RHB; genus _Tenuivirus_) has only been reported from the Americas, where it causes a serious disease of the crop. Symptoms may include chlorosis and bleaching of leaves, leaf necrosis, stunting, loss of plant vigour and reduced seed production. Yield losses are largest when plants are infected early in the cropping cycle.

RHBV is transmitted specifically by the plant hopper vector _Tagosodes_ (previously _Sogatodes_) _orizicolus_, which can also cause severe damage ("hopper burn") to the plants in its own right. Other than to rice, it can also transmit RHBV to other graminaceous hosts, including oats, barley, rye and some grasses. The vector cannot overwinter in cool regions, and this limits the range of RHBV. High vector numbers, for example due to moist conditions in the case above, may lead to a high incidence of virus. However, some pathogenic effect of RHBV on the vector insects has been observed, which may explain a cyclical nature of disease outbreaks.

Disease management of insect-transmitted viruses mostly depends on vector control with insecticides as well as removal of virus and vector reservoir hosts near crops. Rice varieties with various levels of resistance to RHBV or its vector are available, and most Japonica rice varieties are resistant to RHBV.

Other rice viruses in the same genus (such as _Rice stripe virus_ and _Rice grassy stunt virus_) originate in Asia and are transmitted by different plant hopper vectors.
