Date: Mon 11 May 2020 2:23 PM
Source: The Mercury News, Reuters report [edited]
https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/05/11/coronavirus-yemen-declares-aden-an-infested-city/


Yemeni authorities declared Aden, interim seat of the Saudi-backed government, an "infested" city on Monday [11 May 2020] after the number of coronavirus [COVID-19] cases there jumped and clashes erupted elsewhere in the south between separatists and government forces. A 5-year war has shattered Yemen's health system, pushed millions to the brink of famine, and divided the country between the internationally recognized government and the Houthi group that ousted it from power in the capital, Sanaa, in late 2014.

The World Health Organization (WHO) says there is a full-blown transmission of the virus in Yemen, with the disease spreading undetected among a population with some of the lowest levels of immunity to disease compared with other states. Testing capabilities are inadequate but the WHO has also urged local authorities to transparently report confirmed cases.

The Aden-based government's coronavirus committee on Monday [11 May 2020] reported 5 new cases, with 1 death, in Hadhramout province, taking the total count in areas under the Saudi-backed government's control to 56 with 9 deaths. It had late on Sunday [10 May 2020] announced 17 new COVID-19 cases, 10 of them in Aden, where the total count so far stands at 35 infections, with 4 deaths.

The Iran-aligned Houthi movement, which controls Sanaa and most large urban centers, has reported 2 cases, with 1 death. The Aden-based government has accused Houthi authorities of covering up an outbreak in Sanaa, an accusation they deny. The committee said Aden had been declared an "infested city" because of the spread of the coronavirus and other diseases already rife in Yemen after recent flooding. It said movement from Aden to other regions was barred, except for transport of goods.

"The administrative and political situation in Aden is also hampering efforts to combat the coronavirus and this should be remedied so relevant entities can carry out their duties," the committee said on its Twitter account. The separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC) on [25 Apr 2020] declared self-rule in Aden and other southern regions, threatening to renew a conflict with the Saudi-backed government in Yemen's multifaceted war. STC and the government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi are both part of the anti-Houthi coalition led by Saudi Arabia, but they clashed last year [2019] until Riyadh brokered a deal in November [2019].

Residents reported shelling early on Monday [11 May 2020] in Abyan province. STC said its fighters were attacked by government forces. There was no immediate comment from the Hadi government.

The Western-backed coalition intervened in March 2015 to restore Hadi's government to power in Sanaa, but the conflict, largely seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran, has been in stalemate for years. More than 100 000 have been killed since 2015 and some 80% of the population, or 24 million, rely on aid while some 10 million face hunger. The coalition on [24 Apr 2020] extended by 1 month a nationwide ceasefire prompted by the coronavirus outbreak as the United Nations seeks to hold virtual talks to agree a permanent truce, coordinate coronavirus efforts, and restart peace talks. The Houthis, who say they are fighting a corrupt system, have not formally accepted the truce though violence has abated.

The WHO late on Saturday [9 May 2020] ordered a pause in staff activity in main Houthi-held areas, citing "credible threats" to staff, but reversed the directive on Sunday [10 May 2020], according to a document seen by Reuters and confirmed by the organization. The suspension was prompted by accusations from Houthi officials that the 1st coronavirus case announced in Sanaa, a Somali man found dead in a hotel, was brought to the capital by the WHO. A Houthi official on Sunday [10 May 2020] tweeted a retraction.

The United Nations on Sunday [10 May 2020] voiced concern that migrants are being stigmatized as "transmitters of disease," saying in a statement that some have been forced to move to frontlines and desert areas with no essential services. Yemen has long been a transit point for migrants and refugees from the Horn of Africa trying to reach Gulf states.

[4] WHO situation report 112 (as of 11 May 2020)
Date: Mon 11 May 2020
Source: WHO [abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200511-covid-19-sitrep-112.pdf


*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 11 May 2020.

Highlights
----------
- WHO has published new guidance on surveillance strategies for COVID-19 human infection. The document provides an overview of surveillance strategies that Member States should consider as part of comprehensive national surveillance for COVID-19. It also emphasises the need to adapt and reinforce existing national systems where appropriate and to scale-up surveillance capacities as needed (https://www.who.int/publications-detail/surveillance-strategies-for-covid-19-human-infection).

- WHO has published new guidance on contact tracing in the context of COVID-19. When systematically applied, the guidance will help break the chains of transmission of COVID-19 and other infectious disease and is thus an essential public health tool for controlling infectious disease outbreaks (https://www.who.int/publications-detail/contact-tracing-in-the-context-of-covid-19).

- In today's 'subject in focus', WHO provides an update on the work of the Emergency Medical Teams, the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, and Risk Communication and Community Engagement.

Subject in focus: partner coordination update
---------------------------------------------
UNICEF, IFRC, US CDC, and OCHA are major partners embedded in the global COVID-19 incident management team in Geneva and are supporting all pillars of response.

Emergency Medical Teams (EMTs)
------------------------------
- 127 Emergency Medical Teams (EMTs) are ready or getting ready for deployment.
- To date, a total of 20 EMTs have been internationally deployed to provide support to 16 countries and another 37 EMTs are supporting national operations in the response to COVID-19. More than 3600 beds have been managed by EMTs and have contributed to increasing national capacity, while 340 different training events have been conducted benefitting almost 11 000 front line responders.
- As of 10 May 2020, international operations have significantly increased in the African Region, in Ghana, South Africa, Zambia, Senegal, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Cameroon, Algeria, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Congo, and Zimbabwe. EMTs have also deployed in the European Region notably in Italy where 4 international EMTs, in addition to 2 Italian EMTs have contributed to national operations. In addition, EMTs have provided support to Cambodia, Mongolia, Kyrgyzstan, and Bangladesh.

Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN)
--------------------------------------------------
- GOARN partners and networks are providing technical advice across all health operation pillars, particularly clinical management, infection prevention and control, laboratory, and risk communication and community engagement (RCCE).
- As of 11 May 2020, 518 offers of support have been received from GOARN partners; and 72 individuals have deployed to the field. Operational factors that have a major impact on the deployment of international support are the heavy restrictions and quarantine requirements related to international air transport travel. WHO is working with the United Nations World Food Program (WFP), partners, and stakeholders to maximise the potential of existing commercial traffic, and special capacity available for COVID-19 operations.
- WHO, GOARN partners, and stakeholders continue to collaborate on the roll-out and implementation of Go.Data. Go.Data is a field platform for collecting and analyzing key data for case investigations; for contact tracing and follow-up; and for generating chains of transmission (https://www.who.int/godata/about).
- The Go.Data team has involved staff and consultants in France, Germany, Malta, Switzerland, the US, and Viet Nam. The team has responded to 279 requests from 140 countries and territories and is supporting 53 projects worldwide to implement Go.data. 72 partners have been part of briefings, webinars, and trainings, including WHO major offices, ministries of health, hospitals, universities and research centres, technical partners, and networks, NGOs, stakeholders, donors, and the private sector.

Risk Communications and Community Engagement (RCCE)
---------------------------------------------------
- The Risk Communications and Community Engagement (RCCE) partners have published 'Tips for engaging communities during COVID-19 in Low Resource settings', which is available from the Red Cross Community Engagement Hub, hosted by the British Red Cross (https://communityengagementhub.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/05/CE-low-resource-settings-distance-April-2020.pdf).

UNESCO, UNICEF, the World Bank, and WFP have published a Framework for Reopening Schools, addressing the impact of school-closure on children, specifically the marginalized. It highlights the importance of education and of wellbeing considerations for safe school return, providing advice on core pillars including safe operations, learning, including the most marginalized, wellbeing, and protection (https://www.unicef.org/documents/framework-reopening-schools).

Additional information is available on the GOARN knowledge platform for COVID-19 to share resources from partners and other stakeholders (https://extranet.who.int/goarn/COVID19Hub).

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 214. This includes 19 countries (including 4 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 61 countries (including 7 territories) from the European region, 10 countries from the South East Asia region, 22 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 54 countries (including 19 territories) from the Americas region, and 48 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
------------------------------------------
The Americas region reported 47 073 new cases (53.0% of the global newly reported cases), and 3151 deaths (69.5%) were recorded for this 24-hour period. Of the newly confirmed cases in the region, 55.0% were reported by the USA, followed by Brazil at 22.5%, and Peru at 6.7%. Recognizing that USA data are overshadowing the regional proportions, if newly confirmed cases from the USA are excluded, then Brazil reported 50.0% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Peru at 14.9%, Mexico at 9.1%, and Chile at 7.8%.

The European region reported 23 660 new cases (26.6% of the global newly reported cases) and 1051 deaths (23.2%). Russia reported 49.3% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, the UK 16.6%, Turkey 6.5%, Belarus 3.9%, and Italy and Spain 3.4% each.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 9436 new cases (10.6% of the global newly reported cases) and 135 deaths (3.0%). Saudi Arabia reported 20.3% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Pakistan at 15.6%, Iran at 14.7%, Qatar at 12.6%, and the United Arab Emirates at 8.3%.

The African region reported 1907 new cases (2.1% of the global newly reported cases) and 46 deaths (1.0%). South Africa reported 31.2% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Nigeria at 13.0%, Cameroon at 12.8%, Algeria at 8.7%, Mayotte at 7.0%, and Guinea at 5.5%.

The Western Pacific region reported 1248 new cases (1.4% of the global newly reported cases) and 23 deaths (0.51%). Singapore reported 70.2% of the newly reported cases, followed by the Philippines at 14.7%, and Malaysia at 5.4%. Removing Singapore from the denominator has the Philippines at 49.5%, Malaysia at 18.0%, Japan at 13.7%, and South Korea at 9.4%.

The South East Asia region reported 5567 new cases (6.3% of the global newly reported cases) and 125 deaths (2.8%). India reported 75.7% of newly reported cases, followed by Bangladesh at 15.9% and Indonesia at 7.0%. Removing India from the denominator, Bangladesh represents 65.5% of the newly reported cases, Indonesia represents 28.6%, the Maldives at 3.7%, and Sri Lanka at 1.2%.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 11 May 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. Europe is decreasing in contribution to this graph but it may still be a weekend artifact, the Americas have rebounded significantly and South East Asia is increasing, fueled by the increasing cases reported by India.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: It is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Johns Hopkin's CSSE or Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have, at times, significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the John Hopkins CSSE or Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4). - Mod.MPP]
