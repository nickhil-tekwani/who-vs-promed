Foul play likely in anthrax cases
---------------------------------
The FBI has taken over the investigation of 2 anthrax cases in Florida.
---------------------------------
BOCA RATON, Fla., Oct. 9 - Sen. Bob Graham (D FL), the chairman of the
Senate Intelligence Committee, met with CDC Director Jeffrey Koplan on
Monday night and said afterward, "I asked Dr. Koplan what would be the
likelihood that such a disease could have occurred without human
intervention. His words were, 'Nil to none.'" Graham told the Miami Herald
that he is "worried" by the anthrax cases, but added that there is "no
reason to suspect" they were linked to the 11 Sep 2001 terrorist attacks or
the hijackers who carried them out - some of whom had lived near the
newspaper offices.
A state health official added to the growing conviction that the 2 anthrax
cases at American Media Inc., which left one man dead and another
hospitalized, were the result of foul play. "The chances are one in a
billion" that 2 such cases would occur naturally, said Dr. Landis Crockett,
director of disease control for the Florida Department of Health. But
Florida Health Secretary John Agwunobi told MSNBC Cable on Tuesday that the
source of the bacterium remains unknown. "Our investigators aren't ruling
out anything at this point," he said. He also sought to reassure the
public, saying the isolated cases do not pose a public health threat.
Barbara Reynolds, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta, said federal investigators have eliminated the
obvious environmental sources of anthrax at the offices of AMI, the
publisher of tabloid newspapers The Sun and The National Enquirer and The
Globe. The FBI on Monday sealed off the AMI offices, and agents donned
protective gear before going inside. "We regard this as an investigation
that could become a clear criminal investigation, and we are pursuing this
with all the dispatch and care that's appropriate," U.S. Attorney General
John Ashcroft said. "We don't have enough information to know whether this
could be related to terrorism or not."
Anthrax cannot be spread from person to person, but all 300 people who work
in the building - and anyone who spent more than an hour inside since Aug.
1 - were advised to visit health officials for tests and antibiotics. The
Palm Beach County Health Department tested 743 people linked to the
building on Monday and expected an additional 100 people on Tuesday, said
Alina Alonso, the department's director of clinical services.
A worker at the AMI offices who was treated last week for pneumonia said
she had been instructed to return Tuesday for further tests. "I'm glad to
have 2 tests," [a 67-year-old female employee of the company,
told the Miami Herald. "All my friends are telling me how lucky I am to
have pneumonia. I don't think they believe I have it."
The anthrax scare also spread to Virginia, but a doctor on Tuesday said
that initial lab tests on a patient with connections to The Sun have thus
far been negative. "I just want to allay everybody's anxiety about this
case because it just doesn't seem to fit the criteria," said Dr. Thomas
Ryan of Price William Hospital in Manassas, VA.
Health officials initially considered [the first patient's death as an
anomaly, but
concerns were heightened when anthrax was detected on his computer keyboard
and a second case of anthrax exposure involving a co-worker was confirmed
on Monday. The second case involved a Sun mailroom employee. Health
officials said tests confirmed he had anthrax bacteria in his nasal
passages, but he was not showing symptoms of the disease. [The mailroom
employee was tested for anthrax because he happened to be in a hospital
for what co-workers said was an unrelated heart problem. He was in stable
condition at a Miami-Dade County hospital Monday, being treated with
antibiotics, according to health officials.
Though there is no evidence linking the outbreak to the 11 Sep 2001
attacks, news accounts noted that the dead photo editor, lived about a mile
from an air strip where flight school owner Marian Smith said suspected
hijacker Mohamed Atta rented planes. Several suspected hijackers also
visited a crop-dusting business in Belle Glade, 40 miles from [the deceased
patient's home in Lantana. The Miami Herald also reported that
investigators were reviewing the names of several subscribers of one
tabloid whose names are similar to those of 2 hijackers.
Federal officials are sending Florida 100 cases of antibiotics to back up
the local supply. The antibiotics came from a federal stockpile that holds
enough to treat 2 million cases of anthrax.

Letter scrutinized as possible source of anthrax
------------------------------------------------
8 Oct 2001 Posted: 11:16 PM EDT (0316 GMT) Authorities are taking nose
swabs and blood samples from people who worked in or visited the building.
Test results from the nose swabs won't be available for several days; blood
test results could take several weeks. However, health officials have not
been able to reach a few individuals who worked in the building, Agwunobi
said. They are being asked to call (800) 342-3557. Employees were also
being told to fill out a public health department questionnaire, detailing
their visits the mail room, text or photo libraries. Another question:
"Since 11 Sep 2001, have you noticed any unusual occurrences at work?"
[A mailroom employee was admitted to Cedars Medical Center in Dade County
last week after feeling ill and exhibiting flu-like symptoms at work. He
felt so sick that co-workers drove him home, 2 counties away. Physicians
conducted tests and began
treating him for pneumonia, but his case became more complex once the
[confirmed case of pulmonary anthrax came to light. FBI agents came to the
hospital and questioned [the mailroom employee's wife "for hours," a
family spokesperson said. [As there is no
confirmation of anthrax lesions, it might be assumed that any chest x-ray
was of an expected pneumonia. - Mod.MHJ
At the same time, the hospital ran tests and conducted a nasal passage swab
to test for anthrax exposure, discovering anthrax spores in [the man's nose.
[He did not contract respiratory anthrax, hospital officials said, and
so far has exhibited no clinical symptoms [associated with the bacterium.
[The deceased photo editor fell ill after a recent trip to North Carolina,
but a Florida state epidemiologist said he did not believe [the man
contracted the disease
during his trip. The incubation period for anthrax is between 6 and 45
days, a period which would not have included his trip. As photo editor,
[the deceased worked on a number of stories but did not leave the
building, officials said.

An editorial states that with the recent anthrax exposure, the government
must "shore up" its defenses, including "specific actions and a basic
reorientation of defense scientists from physics to biology." The editorial
suggests that the government improve its supervision of biowarfare vaccine
production, particularly in light of production problems with the anthrax
vaccine. Further, the editorial suggests that the government provide grants
for biological defense-related research.
President Bush also should name biologists to unfilled positions at NIH and
the FDA because "well-regarded biologists" can help the United States
"mount a strong defense against bioweapons."

Even though the anthrax cases raise suspicion and fears of bioterrorism,
there are "reasons to be reassured," an editorial states. For instance, the
"event seems to be relatively small," which could mean that the "job was
either botched or the goal was not mass murder but rather harm to a
particular individual or 2." Another "comforting element" is the medical
and public health systems' "rapid response" to the exposures, the editorial
states.

Even if these anthrax exposures do not prove to be related to terrorism,
"the point to keep in mind is that sooner or later" this won't be a "false
terror alarm," an editorial says. The editorial suggests that the federal
government improve awareness of bioterrorism among public health officials,
doctors, and hospitals.

Update: Ongoing Investigation of Anthrax in Florida 8 Oct 2001
------------------------------------
Today public health officials in Palm Beach County Health Department began
to evaluate and offer prophylactic treatment to persons who might have been
exposed to _Bacillus anthracis_ (the bacterium that causes anthrax) while
working or visiting America Media Inc. (AMI) in Boca Raton, Florida.
Persons known to have been in the AMI building for at least one hour since
1 Aug 2001 will be contacted if they have not already been evaluated. Those
who are not currently in Florida might seek care in other jurisdictions.
Contact your local or State health department if this happens in your
jurisdiction, so that the information can be relayed to CDC and the Palm
Beach County Health Department. The prophylactic antibiotic treatment
regimens recommended for persons potentially exposed to _B. anthracis_ at
AMI are attached. Additional information about prophylactic treatment for
anthrax can be found at:
Federal agencies and public health officials are continuing to investigate
anthrax in Florida. No additional cases of anthrax have been identified.
Reminder: symptoms of inhalational anthrax include fever, muscle aches, and
fatigue that rapidly progress to severe systemic illness. Workers and
visitors associated with the AMI worksite in Florida who develop such
symptoms should be thoroughly evaluated to exclude anthrax and be reported
to the state health department.

[The thinking at this time is clearly that this is a biocrime, not
bioterrorism. The former might be defined as having criminal objectives
that are narrow and in a definable close relationship to the target, and
thus the perpetrator would be "getting even" over something the company
published or how he or she had been treated by the company. While the
company will be shut down for a couple of weeks, as the FBI treats it as a
crime scene, the financial cost to The Sun will be significant though it
may not shut it down permanently. A wide variety of people in and out the
public eye have been unwilling subjects of their publications. - Mod.MHJ
