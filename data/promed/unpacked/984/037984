Media news articles (1,2,3) on [5 Jun 2021], reported that at least 6 residents of Sidomulo Village, Pejarvjo District, Tulunggung Regency experienced skin signs similar to those of anthrax with blisters on the skin forming itching circles. "Anthrax in Pajervojo (sub-district), information has spread to humans. There are 6 residents who are (already) contaminated, their skin is punctured," said an unnamed source with an ASN background on [Sat 5 Jun 2021]

When this information was confirmed to officials at the Tulunggung District Health Office, Didik Eka, the head of disease prevention and control, did not immediately confirm claiming that the issue was the domain of the leadership. He felt that he was not entitled to make a statement despite having preliminary data and information about anthrax outbreaks in livestock, which local residents suspected of having contracted the disease.

"Honestly, I don't dare to comment. This area is still in the lead. So if that's the case, please go straight to the (Head of Health) Office of Health Services," Didik said. However, upon learning that an issue of anthrax in cattle in Pejarvjo had been published in the mass media quoting a direct statement from the regent of Tulunggung Marito Birovo, Didik later confirmed the information that 6 residents had a skin disease with changes very similar to those of anthrax.

The Indonesian weekly magazine, Tempo.co, reports that the s6 suspected anthrax cases have been reported in the village in Tulungagung, East Java and have been released from the hospital after treatment. [ref: Temp.co article: https://en.tempo.co/read/1469727/government-carefully-handles-east-java-anthrax-case]

It is believed that they contracted anthrax from their livestock after dozens of cattle were found dead from the bacterial disease.

Since the 1st case was reported on [Wed 2 Jun 2021], health authorities have found no new cases yet at the Sidomulyo Village in East Java.

Based on the samples collected by the veterinary center on the livestock and village residents confirmed that anthrax bacteria was found in the cattle but are still studying the skin samples from the residents. The team expects a report will be produced on [10 Jun 2021].

Anthrax is a serious infectious disease caused by gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria known as _Bacillus anthracis_. Anthrax can be found naturally in soil and commonly affects domestic and wild animals around the world. Although it is rare, people can get sick with anthrax if they come in contact with infected animals or contaminated animal products.

Cutaneous anthrax occurs when the spore (or possibly the bacterium) enters a cut or abrasion on the skin. It starts out as a raised bump that looks like an insect bite. It then develops into a blackened lesion called an eschar that may form a scab. Lymph glands in the area may swell plus edema may be present. This form of anthrax responds well to antibiotics. If untreated, deaths can occur if the infection goes systemic. 95% of cases of anthrax are cutaneous.

[Tulungagung Regencu (pronounced [tuloŋaɡoŋ]) is a regency (kabupaten) of East Java Province, Indonesia. It covers an area of 1055.65 km2 and had a population of 990 159 at the 2010 Census [2] the more recent official estimate (as at mid 2019) is 1 118 814 [3]. The administrative headquarters is in the town of Tulungagung. The Wikipedia report contains a map showing where this regency is in East Java. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulungagung_Regency

In brief, this was a significant livestock outbreak of anthrax involving "dozens" of cattle that were found dead. The animal diagnosis has been confirmed by the veterinary authorities. The 6 human cases were sampled, treated with antibiotics, and released. The medical authorities have yet to confirm the diagnosis on the human cases. This is not unusual with human cases. The best way to sample human cutaneous cases is to use a hypodermic needle to extract the bloody fluid underneath the lesion. Surface swabs can fail. An additional problem with human cases is that they will self-treat with antibiotics from the village pharmacy while on their way to see a doctor.

Cutaneous anthrax lesions are inflamed but only itch. They are not painful. This is typical.

The Temp.co report has some errors. Firstly, they say that anthrax in contagious. This is very rare; it is just an infectious disease. They suggest treating the expose cattle with antibiotics for 20 days. Frankly it is better to use a single shot of a long acting antibiotic and limit it to animals showing a raised temperature or other signs. But immediately vaccinate the herd and all other cattle in the community with Sterne vaccine or whatever is the recognised vaccine because of the risk from contaminated Tabanid haemophagious flies. The female flies will be actively looking for their next meal in neighbouring herds and commonly up to 4-5 Kms (2.5-3 mi).
