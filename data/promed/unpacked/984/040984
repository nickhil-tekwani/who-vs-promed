In Tasmania, the Devil Now Faces Its Own Hell
--------------------------------
Even by the brutish standards of Tasmanian devils, Rosie, Harry and Clyde
have led a lamentable life. A year ago, when the 3 were each the size of a
sesame seed, they wriggled out of their mother's birth canal and undulated
their way to her pouch. There, each locked onto a teat and grew like
gangbusters.
But tragedy struck. Within months, their mother developed devil facial
tumor disease -- a mysterious malady that in the last 3 years has killed
nearly half of all the world's devils, marsupials that are found only in
Tasmania. Shortly after she died, the baby devils, grown to the size of
tiny puppies, were found dangling from their mother's pouch, starving to death.
Rescued and reared by hand, Rosie, Harry and Clyde recently joined 6
similarly orphaned devils at the Launceston Lakes and Wildlife Park, all in
strict quarantine. The fate of their exotic species -- _Sarcophilus
harrisii_ -- may lie in what happens to these rambunctious youngsters in
the next 12 to 18 months.
"If they contract the disease, devils may be headed for extinction in the
wild," said Nick Mooney, a wildlife biologist with Tasmania's Department of
Primary Industries, Water and Environment in Hobart. "If they're free of
the disease, we may have reason for hope."
Right now, wildlife experts are struggling to comprehend the nature of the
fast-moving epidemic. Moving at a rate of 6 to 10 miles a year, it is 100
percent fatal. Only the west coast, isolated by mountain ranges
inhospitable to devils, is disease free. Nearly half of the estimated 150
000 devils in Tasmania are now dead.
Devil facial tumor disease is grotesque; the mother of Rosie and her
brothers died when grotesque tumors ballooned out of her face and neck,
choking off her ability to eat. It is also an extraordinary puzzle.
Scientists do not understand its cause, mode of transmission, time from
infection until the tumors appear, or potential to infect others.
Their current best guess breaks all the rules of modern biology. Scientists
suspect that the disease is caused by a cancer cell that itself moves from
one animal to another when they bite one another.
Having declared an emergency, officials are trapping healthy devils for
captive breeding in case the disease cannot be stopped. The real devil
bears no resemblance to Taz, the Warner Brothers Looney Tunes cartoon
character that roars and whirls like a dervish. A real devil is the size of
a spaniel, with strong forelimbs, a huge head and a disappointing back end.
Geoff King, who lures devils to his ranch in northwestern Tasmania for
ecotourists to observe, said they lived solitary, nocturnal lives, coming
together to devour carrion. Its bite is as strong as that of a dog 4 times
its weight. "They are nature's cleanup crew," Mr. King said.
Females have lustrous black coats with a purple hue, white stripes on their
rump or below the neck, exceptionally long luxurious whiskers and narrow
pointy faces. When they get excited, their ears turn blood red. "They are
beautiful," Mr. King said.
Males have similar markings along with big boxy heads and heavily scarred
faces and rumps. A devil can eat a quarter of its body weight in one
feeding. "They're as tough as bloody nails," Mr. King said.
Devils got their name from early European settlers who heard spine-chilling
screams and thought that Satan was surely in the backyard. "Devils do make
weird noises," Mr. King said. "When they first arrive at a carcass," he
said, "they make a recognition signal -- whorf? Are you there? Then they
start hissing from the stomach. Growls turn to whines and flow into
screeches. They sound like a groaning witch."
Devil sex turns up the volume. In March and April, males engage in vicious,
blood-soaked combat, said Dr. Menna Jones, a wildlife biologist who also
works in the environment department. Females select "big butch dudes," Dr.
Jones said, and allow themselves to be dragged by the scruff of the neck
into a burrow. There they scream and fight for several days, mating many
times for hours at a time. At the end of such bouts, the male thrusts his
sperm into the female every 2 minutes.
Three weeks later, the female gives birth to about 20 or 30 embryos that
wiggle through a string of mucus that leads to her pouch, which has only 4
teats, Dr. Jones said. The first to arrive lock on and survive. All others
perish.
By August the pouch gets crowded. When she hunts, the mother leaves her
roly-poly little devils in a den. The young are weaned at 9 months,
emerging from the den in the fall as goofy teenagers. Mom departs.
After 6 years of scavenging, screeching and seeking mates, devils abruptly
die, Dr. Jones said. They are one of the few species in the world with
so-called catastrophic mortality. How and why they die this way is not
known, she said.
Tasmanians have always taken devils for granted, Mr. Mooney said. Few
scientists ever bothered to study them. When the 1st animal with facial
tumors was photographed, in 1996, he said, "people thought, eeew, that
looks horrible, but it did not ring alarm bells."
After 5 more years scientists realized the disease was widespread, Mr.
Mooney said. Later surveys show a devastating picture. Spread
animal-to-animal, the disease is now endemic to 2/3 of the island, which is
slightly smaller than West Virginia. The disease starts out as a
raspberry-like lesion on the gums, palate or under the tongue, Dr. Jones
said. Within months, tumors erupt around the mouth, neck and face. A few
weeks later, they explode, weeping and oozing, pushing out teeth, eyes or
noses, and sometimes invading the rest of the body. "It is a disgusting
sight," Dr. Jones said. "Animals starve to death 3 to 6 months after the
1st signs of a tumor.
Here in Launceston, Dr. Stephen Pyecroft is spearheading the government's
investigation into what is causing the disease. A virus seemed likely. But
so far, Dr. Pyecroft said, every effort to identify a virus has come up
empty-handed. A virus has not been ruled out, he added, but scientists are
now entertaining other hypotheses.
Since Tasmania has widespread use of agricultural chemicals and pesticides,
researchers are looking at 10 toxins to see if devil disease is associated
with poisons that can cause tumors.
But the leading theory is that devil facial tumor disease is caused by a
transmissible tumor cell, Dr. Pyecroft said. It goes like this: About a
decade ago, a random mutation occurred in a single animal in a type of cell
involved in hormonal regulation. This devil developed tumors on or near its
face. When another devil bit into the tumor, it was infected with tumor
cells. With time, tumor cells were passed around in the bloody fray of
devil social life, spreading the disease.
In this hypothesis, tumor cells alone are the infectious agent. In nature,
this is not supposed to happen, Dr. Pyecroft conceded. Healthy animals
exposed to pathogens, including tumor cells, will normally mount an immune
response to fight off the infection.
But genetically speaking, devils are virtual clones. With scant variation
in their DNA -- perhaps from a population bottleneck in the recent past --
they may have nearly identical immune systems. Hence they cannot fight off
the tumor cells.
Every tumor cell examined so far is the same in every animal, male and
female, regardless of area of origin. The chromosomal rearrangements,
presumably from the one random mutation, are identical.
Dr. Pyecroft said another disease offered support for the idea that tumor
cells could be infectious. That disorder, canine transmissible venereal
tumor disease, is passed among dogs during sex or when they lick and sniff
infected tissue. The tumors are identical, suggesting that they are passed
by contact. The big difference is that the disease is not fatal in dogs.
They mount an immune response and get over it.
Researchers are growing devil tumor cells in petri dishes to explore their
basic biology. "We're knocking weird cells on their heads to figure this
out," Dr. Pyecroft said.
Meanwhile, Dr. Mooney's team is trapping devils island-wide to determine
the extent of the epidemic. They are also in the process of trapping 25
young animals from apparently disease-free areas as an insurance policy.
The juvenile devils are being placed in urban and offshore sites to keep
them apart from older, wild devils. If after a year or so they show no
signs of disease, they will be bred to ensure survival of their species.
Similarly, Rosie, Harry and Clyde are living with other orphans -- Donny,
Hansel, Gretel, Beatrice, Zilla and Scamp. "We usually don't see the
disease until after the animals turn 2 years old," said Heather Hesterman,
another biologist on the team. It is possible they might get the disease
from their mother's milk or contact with her saliva, Ms. Hesterman said. On
the other hand, they may have resistance to it.
Veterinarians will watch the orphans for the next year or so to see what
happens.
"We have so many question marks, so little time," Ms. Hesterman said.

[A unique and intriguing theory. Although these special creatures may look
nothing like the cartoon character based on them, it may be that the
cartoon character has contributed to the fascination with this animal. We
wish the scientists luck on discovering the cause of the disease and saving
the devils.- Mod.TG]
