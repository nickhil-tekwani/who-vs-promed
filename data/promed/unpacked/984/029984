An interim statement from the Mountain Gorilla Veterinary Project
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The Mountain Gorilla Veterinary Project, together with the Rwandan Office
of Tourism and National Parks (ORTPN), is currently working with the New
Scientist magazine to respond to the recent reports on respiratory diseases
in mountain gorillas.
In the interim, the original abstract to which the media stories refer may
be accessed via the Wildlife Disease Association conference website:
<http://www.rainforest-crc.jcu.edu.au/events/WildlifeDiseasesAssocConf/Pro=gOverview.htm=20>
under the title "Causes of death for mountain gorillas (_Gorilla beringei
beringei_ and _G. b. undecided_) from 1968-2004: an aid to conservation
programs."
Following this link will download a large pdf file containing numerous
abstracts presented at the conference. The individual abstract may be
downloaded directly from the Morris Animal Foundation's website:
<http://www.morrisanimalfoundation.org> (follow the link for Mountain
Gorilla Update).
Additional information on the risks of transmission of human pathogens to
gorillas can be found at
<http://www.mountaingorillas.org/files/ourwork/Homsy_rev.pdf>, which links
to a 1999 report entitled "Ape Tourism and Human Diseases: How close should
we get?"
Should you have questions regarding the abstract or other MGVP activities,
please contact Morris Animal Foundation's marketing/communications
department by email at <clester@MorrisAnimalFoundation.org>. We appreciate
your patience as we work to resolve this issue in a prompt and professional
manner.
