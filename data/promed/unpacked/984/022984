Annual number of deaths from rabies hits 70 000
-----------------------------------------------
The Global Alliance for Rabies Control (GARC) today [28 Sep 2011]
announces that preliminary data released this month at the OIE Global
Conference on Eliminating Rabies has estimated 70 000 people worldwide
die each year from rabies at a cost of USD 4 billion.

The research, released to mark the importance of World Rabies Day [28
Sep 2011], shows that deaths from rabies are on the increase, with the
disease reaching epidemic proportions in certain parts of the world.
It also confirms rabies as one of the most lethal zoonotic, or
animal-transmitted diseases, killing more people each year than SARS,
H5N1, and dengue fever, combined.

Although rabies is entirely preventable, controlling the disease has
been elusive in large portions of the developing world due to a lack
of resources with which to carry out vaccination programmes. The
subsequent epidemic has wrought a disproportionate effect on the
young, with one child dying every 10 minutes from the disease.

Rabies places a dreadful economic burden on the populations where it
strikes, but this is only half the story, as it also brings untold
pain and suffering to victims and survivors. This is made all the
worse by the fact that we know it is preventable, and we call on
governments and health authorities around the world to join us in
taking action," said Professor Deborah Briggs, executive director,
GARC.

"Research has proven that in those parts of the world where dog rabies
is present and comprehensive dog vaccination programmes have been
carried out in conjunction with an improvement in educational
awareness and availability of human vaccines, deaths from rabies have
been reduced to zero. Our pilot schemes show that we can replicate
this success around the world, saving human and animal lives. With the
right commitment, this problem could be addressed on a global scale,"
said Dr Elizabeth Miranda, Asian Coordinator, GARC.

[Our thanks to Shamsudeen for bringing this update to our notice. For
additional OIE conclusions and recommendations see

I would like to remind our members that there has been significant
success in the wildlife campaigns to control this disease via oral
vaccines for foxes (various species), raccoons, coyotes in North
America and Europe. It is also possible to reduce the impact of
infected vampire bats. But there is still a long way to go. -
