Information about outbreaks of anthrax in the Eastern Kazakhstan oblast in
2004.
-----------------------------------------------
(1) In the Eastern Kazakhstan oblast, from 7-9 Jun 2004, 2 cases of anthrax
were reported among the inhabitants of the Ust'-Talovka Shemonaikhinsky rayon.
The village [settlement] of the Ust'-Talovka Ustalovsky, rural district of
the Shemonaikhinsky rayon, has had an historically low incidence of
anthrax. Only one case of infection in cattle was reported in 1938.
[through 2004, presumably]. The focus of infection could not be established
due to lack of documentation. Prophylactic vaccination of the population
against anthrax was not conducted, because there was no indication of human
disease. In the Ust'-Talovsky rural district, all farm animals were
inoculated against anthrax (800 cattle, 300 sheep, 50 horses).
It has been established that, on 26 May 2004, one cow died. The herder, the
[female] owner of the cow, and 2 of her brothers, without veterinary
examination, killed and butchered the cow. The hide and intestines were
thrown into a pit. The carcass, head, and internal organs were given to a
sausage shop in the village of Shemonaikha.
The 1st patient was the herder, born in 1953, who became sick on 2 Jun
2004, when a spot appeared on his right upper extremity. In the patient's
words, "the spot appeared after a bee string in the right upper extremity."
On 3 Jun 2004, edema appeared on the right extremity, and his body
temperature rose to 38 degrees Celsius. On the patient's spot, a pustule
appeared. On 7 Jun 2004, a clinical and epidemiological diagnosis of
"cutaneous anthrax, mixed pustular-erysipelatous form, heavy flow" was
established. The patient recovered.
The 2nd patient, born in 1953, was a driver [?] and the private owner of
the cow. He went to the doctor on 2 Jun 2004 [incorrectly given as 6 Feb]
complaining of pain in his shoulder and forearm, and, of an elevation of
temperature, which was determined to be 38.9 degrees Celsius. On his elbow
was a bubble filled with fluid. A clinical and epidemiological diagnosis of
"Cutaneous anthrax, mixed pustular-erysipelatous form, medium severity" was
established. The patient recovered.
Comprehensive measures for disinfection were conducted at [his] home, after
which, the location of slaughter was sealed off.
The cow carcass, and other meat, was seized from the sausage shop.
According to anti-epidemic procedures, the meat was buried in a livestock
grave. A disinfecting regimen was conducted at the shop, and, all the
technological equipment was burnt. [Sic. I suspect we have a confusion
here. - Mod.MHJ] Experts from the sanitation-epidemic service took 73
samples from the focus of infection, 10 from the place of slaughter, 4 from
the owner's home, 1 hide sample, 14 meat samples, 34 sausage products, and
8 geological [soil] samples. From the samples of soil, meat, hide, and
animal litter, 6 cultures of anthrax pathogen were isolated.
(2) According to preliminary data in Semipalatinsk (E. Kazakhstan oblast),
2 people are in the hospital with suspected cases of anthrax. The infection
is connected with the forced-slaughter of a horse with anthrax. From
samples of the horse's meat, and soil from the slaughter location, anthrax
pathogen was isolated.

[The Kazakhs are actively chasing this disease. However, it is wise to burn
carcasses, especially if they have been opened, because of the
high-production of spores. If the carcass had not been opened, the
vegetative cells would have died from pH changes, during decomposition,
without producing spores. The Kazakhs eat horse meat, which may explain the
latter animal's slaughter. Thanks to Larissa for this report, and, to Joe
Dudley, Intellibridge, for the translation. - Mod.MHJ]
