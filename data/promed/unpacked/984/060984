Information received on 18 May 2010 from Dr Thomas Sit, Assistant
Director, Inspection & Quarantine, Agriculture, Fisheries and
Conservation Department, Cheung Sha Wan, Hong Kong (P.R. China)

Summary

Report type: Immediate notification
Start date: 5 Feb 2010
Date of 1st confirmation of the event: 10 Feb 2010
Report date: 18 May 2010
Date submitted to OIE: 18 May 2010
Reason for notification: New strain of a listed disease
Manifestation of disease: Clinical disease
Causal agent: Foot and mouth disease virus (SEA topotype)
Serotype: O
Nature of diagnosis: Clinical, Laboratory (basic), Laboratory
(advanced), Necropsy
This event pertains to the whole country

New outbreaks
Outbreak 1: New Territories, HONG KONG
Date of start of the outbreak: 5 Feb 2010
Outbreak status: Continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Farm
Affected animals
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Swine / 2132 / 1240 / 1 / 0 / 0

Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak statistics
Species / Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate /
Apparent case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Swine / 58.16 percent / 0.05 percent / 0.08 percent / 0.05 percent

* Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction
and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: Historically, the serotype prevalent in
Hong Kong has been and continues to be serotype O. Regarding the last
cases, the Pirbright laboratory reported the topotype as being
Cathay. However, the results that returned at the end of March 2010
from Pirbright indicated that the topotype had changed from Cathay to
Southeast Asia topotype on their phylogenetic chart, which is
considered as a variation in the strain and appropriate to be
reported to the OIE.

Note by the OIE Animal Health Information Department: This is a
summary for 3 outbreaks. Details for the other 2 outbreaks will be
provided in the follow-up report.

Control measures
Measures applied: Movement control inside the country, Disinfection
of infected premises/establishment(s), No vaccination, Treatment of
affected animals (symptomatic treatment)

Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results
1. Laboratory name and type: Tai Lung Veterinary Laboratory (National
laboratory)
Tests and results:
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Swine / enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) / 11 Feb 2010 / Positive
Swine / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 10 Feb 2010 / Positive

2. Laboratory name and type: Institute for Animal Health (OIE's
Reference Laboratory)
Tests and results:
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Swine / enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) / 24 Mar 2010 / Positive
Swine / nucleotide sequencing / 24 Mar 2010 / Positive
Swine / reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) /
24 Mar 2010 / Positive

[Though the FMD morbidity rate is as high in pigs as in other
susceptible animal species, their disease is usually of low clinical
significance; in particular, the case-fatality rate (at least, in
adult animals) is extremely low (0.05 percent in the current event,
according to the above notification). It is thus not surprising that
little attention was initially paid to the 2010 serotype O cases in
Hong Kong, a priori regarded of endemic nature. Luckily, samples were
dispatched, leading to their genotyping in Pirbright, which revealed
the change in the disease agent, justifying an official immediate
notification. As already published, the HK, S. Korean, and Japanese
isolates have all been found genetically closely related; see
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/far_east_2010.htm>.

Animal disease information from HK has been internationally available
for decades, including the continuous submission of samples to the
WRLFMD at Pirbright. Fortunately, this transparent policy is being
continued also after the relinquishment of British control in 1997,
when China regained sovereignty. Under the "One Country, Two Systems"
policy, HK has a high degree of autonomy. The HK government,
financially independent from the Government of the People's Republic
of China, oversees the affairs of Hong Kong.

Unfortunately, not a single sample has -- to the best of our
knowledge -- reached, so far, the WRLFMD from mainland China, in
spite of the virus spreading to at least 7 provinces with serious
clinical effects, particularly in cattle, and clear economical
consequences. The HK isolates serve as the world's sentinels for
China's current FMD epizootic. - Mod.AS]
