Asian Soybean Rust: Incidence, Severity, and Morphological Characterization
of _Phakopsora pachyrhizi_ (Uredinia and Telia) in Argentina.

Aires, Av. San Martin 4453 (1417), Buenos Aires, Argentina; and S. E.

4453 (1417), Buenos Aires, Argentina. Plant Dis. 89:109, 2005; published
on-line as DOI: 10.1094/PD-89-0109B, 2005. Accepted for publication 8 Oct 2004.
Asian soybean rust (ASR), caused by _Phakopsora pachyrhizi_, is the most
destructive disease of soybean (_Glycine max_) in many areas of the world.
ASR was 1st detected in Argentina during 2002 in a limited area in the
northern region of the country (2). During the 2004 growing season,
_P.pachyrhizi_ spread rapidly throughout most soybean growing areas of
northwestern and northeastern Argentina. ASR was also was found in some
fields in Entre Rios and Santa Fe provinces. In all areas, symptoms were
expressed late in the 2004 season (growth stages R5.5 to R7), and yield
losses were minimal.
The objectives of this study were to quantify _P. pachyrhizi_ infection in
the canopy and morphologically characterize the fungus from fields where it
had been previously detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (3).
Incidence (percentage of plants affected) and severity (percentage of leaf
area affected, including chlorosis) were visually estimated for 10 plants
arbitrarily collected (April 2004) from each of 3 fields located in Charata
(Chacabuco), Chaco Province (Sample 1, collected in the R6 stage), La
Paloma (Moreno), Santiago del Estero Province (Sample 2, stage R6 to R7),
and Tolloche (Anta), Salta Province (Sample 3, stage R5.5).
Disease assessments were made for the lower, middle, and upper canopy from
15 leaves per plant. The number of pustules per sq cm and uredinia per
lesion were recorded from the undersides of central leaflets for each
trifoliolate observed. Tissue sections were made to observe fructifications
of _P. pachyrhizi_. Incidence of affected plants was 100 percent in all fields.
Disease severity for Sample 1 was 45 percent (range 30 to 60 percent), 20
percent (10 to 30 percent), and 10 percent (5 to 20 percent) for the lower,
middle, and upper canopy, respectively; for Sample 2: 60 percent (30 to 80
percent), 40 percent (25 to 50 percent), and 25 percent (15 to 40 percent)
for the lower, middle, and upper canopy, respectively; and for Sample 3: 25
percent (10 to 50 percent), 15 percent (10 to 20 percent), and 10 percent
(5 to 15 percent) for the lower, middle, and upper canopy, respectively.
The number of pustules per sq cm for Sample 1 was 156/sq cm (range 88 to
200); Sample 2: 172/sq cm (128 to 232); and Sample 3: 120/sq. cm (72 to
232). The number of uredinia per lesion for Sample 1 was 6 per lesion
(range 1 to 15); Sample 2: 5.5 per lesion (1 to 13), and Sample 3: 2.8 per
lesion (1 to 5).
The 2 spore types that were commonly observed were urediniospores and
teliospores. Telia were found on infected leaves mixed with uredinia in
every sample. Urediniospores measured 16 to 22 micrometers (mean 18.5
micrometers) x 25 to 30 micrometers (mean 27 micrometers). Teliospores
measured 8 to 11 micrometers (mean 9 micrometers) x 19 to 27 micrometers
(mean 23.8 micrometers). Spores sizes are in the range described by Ono et
al. (1).
To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of epidemiological and
morphological characterization of ASR in Argentina and the 1st report of
the telial stage of _P. pachyrhizi_ on soybean in South America.

[The report that ASR is present in Argentina is significant, but not
unexpected. Of more interest is that ASR, now that it is established on
kudzu and perhaps other leguminous hosts in the southern tier of USA
states, can be expected to spread northward by wind from these hosts, thus
expanding the range of ASR in the country. Whether ASR teliospores survive
winter conditions in these states remains to be determined. If ASR is
established on susceptible hosts and teliospores remain viable, these hosts
will almost certainly serve as potent inoculum sources for further spread
northward. ASR, now that it is established in the USA, would be expected to
cause significant crop losses and perturbations in commercial trade. ASR is
present in Asia: Russia Far East, Korea, Japan, China, Taiwan, Philippines,
Nepal, India; Australia; Africa: Nigeria, Mozambique, Rwanda, Uganda, South
Africa, Zambia, Zimbabwe; South America: Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina;
Oceania and the USA (several southern states).
