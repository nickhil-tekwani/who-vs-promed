Ebola is still spreading in West Africa, and the World Health Organization declared the situation "serious" when new cases surfaced after officials thought they had contained the virus.

Guinea's capital city of Conakry has recorded its 1st new Ebola cases in more than a month, while other previously unaffected areas have reported infections in the past week, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

The spread of the 2-month-old outbreak, which Guinean authorities said had been contained, risks further complicating the fight against the virus in a region already struggling with weak healthcare systems and porous borders.

"The situation is serious; you can't say it is under control, as cases are continuing, and it is spreading geographically," Dr Pierre Formenty, a WHO expert who recently returned from Guinea, told a news briefing in Geneva on Wednesday [28 May 2014]. "There was no decline. In fact, it is because we are not able to capture all of the outbreak that we were under the impression there was a decline," he said.

The WHO reported 2 new cases, including one death, between 25-27 May 2014 in Conakry. They were the 1st to be detected since 26 Apr 2014. An outbreak in the capital could pose the biggest threat of an epidemic because the city is Guinea's international travel hub.

Telimele and Boffa -- 2 districts north of Conakry that were previously untouched by the disease -- confirmed outbreaks through laboratory testing, the WHO said; 12 cases, including 4 deaths, were reported there between 23-26 May 2014, while suspected ebolavirus disease (EVD) infections were documented in the adjacent districts of Boke and Dubreka.

Aboubacar Sidiki Diakite, who heads the Guinean government's efforts to halt the virus's spread, said the origins of all the new outbreaks had been traced back to cases in Conakry. The problem is that there are families that refuse to give information to health workers. They hide their sick to try to treat them through traditional methods," he said.

The outbreak -- the 1st deadly appearance of the haemorrhagic fever in West Africa -- spread from a remote corner of Guinea to the capital and into Liberia. Sierra Leone reported its 1st confirmed outbreak of the disease earlier this week. The WHO has documented 281 clinical cases of Ebola, including 185 deaths, in Guinea since the virus was 1st identified as an ebolavirus in March [2014]. The disease is thought to have killed 11 people in Liberia, though there have been no new cases there since 9 Apr 2014.

16 cases -- 7 of them confirmed through laboratory testing and another 9 suspected -- have been reported in Sierra Leone's Kailahun district, where 4 people were said to have died of the disease. Researchers say a new strain of the virus caused the West African outbreak.

[2] WHO/AFRO update

Ebola virus disease, West Africa (Situation as of 27 May 2014)
---------------------------------------
Guinea
-------
From 23 May 2014 to 27 May 2014, 4 new districts reported 14 new EVD clinical cases and 5 deaths as follows: Boffa (5 cases and 1 death), Telimele (7 cases and 4 deaths), Boke (1 case and 0 deaths), and Dubreka (1 case and 1 death). Community and nosocomial transmission are still occurring in Gueckedou, Macenta and Conakry.

As of 18:00, 27 May 2014, the total cumulative number of cases due to EVD is 281 and 186 deaths. The classification of these cases and deaths are as follows:

confirmed (163 cases and 103 deaths);
probable (66 cases and 56 deaths) and
suspected (44 cases and 23 deaths).

The geographical distribution of the cases is as follows:

Conakry (48 cases, and 26 deaths),
Gueckedou (176 cases and 126 deaths),
Macenta (31 cases and 19 deaths),
Kissidougou (7 cases and 5 deaths),
Dabola (4 cases and 4 deaths),
Djinguiraye (1 case and 1 death)
in addition to the cases and deaths in the newly affected areas.

The total number of cases in isolation is 16 (10 in Gueckedou, 3 in Telimele and 3 in Boffa).

The number of contacts under follow-up is 427 (250 in Conakry, 213 in Gueckedou, 126 in Macenta, and 88 in Telimele) [My calculator makes the total 677, but subtracting the 250 in Conakry leaves, in fact, 427. - Mod.JW].

In Guinea, Ministry of Health and partners have mounted a response including outbreak investigation, risks assessment, case management, infection control in the newly affected districts, and social mobilization targeting the resistant communities in Gueckedou and Conakry.

Sierra Leone
---------
In Sierra Leone, 16 cases, (7 laboratory-confirmed, 9 suspected) and 5 community deaths have been reported from Kailahun district. The district is located in the eastern region of Sierra Leone sharing borders with Gueckedou in Guinea and also with Liberia.

Liberia
-------
In Liberia, there have been no new cases since 9 Apr 2014. Social mobilization and surveillance have been enhanced in border districts. The number of cases remains subject to change due to reclassification, retrospective investigation, consolidation of cases and laboratory data, and enhanced surveillance.

WHO response
----------
In response to the confirmation of the EVD outbreak in Sierra Leone, WHO held multi-level teleconferences to review the situation and propose key actions to be taken. These include establishment of an Emergency Response Team at the WHO Country Office, deployment of experts, logistics and supplies, and provision of catalytic funds.

WHO is facilitating the active participation of national authorities and community leaders to address community resistance and hiding of cases in some communities in both Guinea and Sierra Leone.

WHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event.

[The reappearance of EVD in Conakry is a serious setback for the control program in Guinea. The capital is now apparently re-exporting cases back to the provinces. Conakry has a population of 2 million, and with families not taking their sick to hospitals, the outbreak could go on indefinitely.

It is also serious that nosocomial transmission is still occurring in Gueckedou, Macenta, and Conakry. Do even Conakry hospitals still lack proper isolation facilities and infection control procedures?

There is an excellent map by CDC of the affected areas at http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/images/outbreaks/GuineaSLeone-map-041414.jpg. Kailahun should now be coloured red. - Mod.JW
