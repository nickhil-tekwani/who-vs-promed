Legionellosis, 5 cases in hospital of Matera, 3 deaths
------------------------------------------------------
Since 1 Jan 2004, 3 people have died in the hospital of Matera from
legionellosis, an infectious disease transmitted from aerosolized water
that may cause pneumonia. 2 other people have also contracted the disease.
The 5 patients were all immunocompromised (elderly and/or HIV infected).
The news of the infection was confirmed with an official notice from ASL
number 4 -- a local sanitary district -- of Matera. The pipes have been
treated with disinfectants and water heated to 60 degrees Celsius.

[Matera, in the Apennine Mountains, is located in southern Italy in the
Basilicata area, corresponding to the arch of Italy's geographical boot. It
appears, but is not entirely certain, that the cases of legionellosis were
acquired nosocomially. This is well-described in the medical literature, as
is the observation that patients with impaired cellular immunity are at
greater risk of morbidity and mortality from the disease.
It is possible that the legionella strains are related to a single source,
but specific typing of the strains -- if the diagnosis was made by culture
rather than by urinary antigen or serologic diagnosis -- is needed to
assess this possibility. - Mod.LL]
