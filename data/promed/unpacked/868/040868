With the confirmation of 7 cases in the last epidemiological week reported by the Ministry of Health , the cases of American trypanosomiasis, known as the Chagas disease, number 15 in the State.

Specialists point out that 3 out of every 10 infected patients suffer cardiac disorders and one out of every 10 presents digestive alterations (typically, enlargement of the esophagus or colon), neurological or mixed.

According to the National Epidemiological Surveillance System, of the cases registered in week 13 [EW, week ending 31 Mar 2018], 5 corresponded to the acute phase of the disease and 2 to the chronic phase.

Regarding acute phase; 3 cases have been confirmed in women and 3 in men and in the second modality [chronic phase], 5 men and 4 women.

Last year [2017] in Yucatan there were 43 cases of Chagas disease (25 men and 18 women), 36 of them in chronic phase (22 men and 14 women).

[The Yucatan region has some of the highest levels of Chagas in the country. A recent study modeling eradication of Chagas from Mexico used the Yucatan Province as an example on how Chagas can be eradicated in 2020 (Lee BY et al. Are the London Declaration's 2020 goals sufficient to control Chagas disease?: Modeling scenarios for the Yucatan Peninsula. PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2018 Mar 19;12(3):e0006337. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0006337. eCollection 2018 Mar.). The study concludes: "Complementary approaches and other prevention and control measures (e.g., peridomestic vector control, vaccines and increased healthcare utilization) are needed to fully interrupt Chagas disease transmission. Even if these goals are missed, most gains are achieved within the first year of implementation, thus the goals should be actively pursued". - Mod.EP
