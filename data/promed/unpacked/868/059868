Canadian officials are reporting a recall of frozen corn that is part of a _Salmonella_ outbreak investigation, but no other details on the outbreak are posted. The recall, made by New Alasko Limited Partnership for Alasko brand IQF (individually quick frozen) whole kernel corn, is underway because of testing by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.

"This recall was triggered by findings by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) during its investigation into a foodborne illness outbreak," according to the outbreak notice. "The investigation into the source of the foodborne illness outbreak is ongoing; however, at this time there have been no confirmed illnesses associated with the consumption of this product."

The company reported that the frozen corn was sold in British Columbia, Alberta and Manitoba and may have been distributed in other provinces and territories. The corn was sold to hotels, restaurants, manufacturers and institutions, which can include hospitals and schools.

There are no date codes for the frozen corn provided in the recall notice. There is concern that customers may have the recalled corn on hand because of the generally long shelf life of such products.

Customers can use the following information to determine whether they have the recalled corn.

Alasko / IQF whole kernel corn / 12 kg (6 x 2 kg) / 1 069505, 816003 4 / Lot: GT21120, P.O: 112943
