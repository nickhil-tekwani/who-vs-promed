[Like the February 2011 outbreak in Splitsko-Dalmatinska, this is
outside the normal season for anthrax, plus it involves a single
horse. Horses are rarely infected from grazing but usually via biting
flies.

This farm had but this singular case, and the report does not indicate
any cases in the cattle on this farm or in neighbouring farms, and
small holdings such as this are frequently close to their neighbours,
which all in all suggests to this moderator that this outbreak, as was
suggested for the February 2011 cases, was the result of contaminated
feed or forage. But in that case, why was only one animal affected? It
is hard to suggest an answer when not on the ground. Usually, these
involve greater individual susceptibility, which can manifest itself
via various causes, such as parasites or pregnancy.

Previous Croatian outbreaks were in October of 2007 with a single
death in Zadarska (immediately north of Splitsko-Dalmatinska), with
herd size essentially not provided, and in 2006 in Sisacko-Moslavaka
(central Croatia) with 10 bovine cases in a herd of 18 animals. The
adjoining country of Bosnia and Herzegovina is similarly sporadically
afflicted.

This is one of those instances in which a genomic investigation would
identify the probable country of origin for any contaminated feed if
it wasn't already listed on the feed sack. - Mod.MHJ]
