MYXOMATOSIS, SQUIRRELS - CANADA
*******************************

Canadian squirrels are once again being attacked by a viral disease --
myxomatosis, which first appeared in the country in the 1950s. Symptoms
include lesions on the body and around mouth and eyes of the animal, which
also loses fur and emits a strong odor. The virus is not a known threat to
humans or to other animals. Surviving squirrels are left with immunity.
People who find squirrels with the symptoms are urged to take them to local
animal shelters for euthanasia, in order to prevent further spread of the
disease.

[Myxomatosis was introduced years ago into Australia to control rabbits,
which it did very effectively for many years. No human cases of infection
were reported - Mod.JW]
