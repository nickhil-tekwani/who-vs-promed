SUFFOLK -- Six horses have died in Suffolk and Chesapeake in less than 2
weeks of a disease feared to be Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE). The
disease killed an Outer Banks woman earlier this month and a 66-year-old
Portsmouth man in 1998.
Of the 6 horses -- 3 in each city -- a viral encephalitis cause of death
has been confirmed by microscopic lesions found in the brains of 3 of the
animals, Dr. Bruce Akey, chief of the office of laboratory services with
the Virginia Department of Agriculture, said.
Further tests are being conducted on the other 3 animals, and tissue
samples from all 6 horses have been sent to the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's (USDA) national veterinary services laboratory (NVSL) in
Ames, Iowa.
Most likely, Akey said, the disease will be confirmed as EEE. It's not
uncommon to see one or 2 cases of the mosquito-borne disease in eastern
Virginia each year. The disease is spread by mosquitoes feeding on birds
and small rodents which then carry it to horses and to humans.
"We use horses as a kind of sentinel situation," Akey said. "As soon as we
see this, we know we've got to do something about the mosquito population."
"It's a pretty scary thing," said Dr. Brandon Wichman, of the Oaks
Veterinary Clinic in Smithfield. Wichman treated one of the animals in
Suffolk before he learned several other horses had shown similar symptoms.
"I've never heard of this many cases in such a short time frame," Wichman said.
"I wouldn't call it an epidemic yet," Akey said. "But I would qualify it is
an unusual number of cases."
Veterinarians statewide have a "huge concern" the virus could be West Nile
Virus (WNV), Wichman said. Seven people died from WNV in New York City last
year, and 62 were hospitalized."There's a big fear it's moved down the
coast," he said.
The state veterinarian's office shares the concern, Akey said.
If the disease is EEE, Akey said, horses, humans and large birds such as
ostriches and emus are susceptible. Dogs, cats and farm animals such as
cows, pigs, sheep and goats are not.
All 6 of the dead animals showed symptoms of encephalitis, commonly called
"sleeping sickness," [not to be confused with sleeping sickness found in
Africa, which is a parasitic rather than a viral infection. - Man. Ed. DS
Akey said. Brain inflammation caused the horses to show loss of muscle
control in the eyes and on the face, and abnormal leg motion and control.
"Usually, the first thing we see is a lethargic animal," Akey said. "He's
not interested in eating, in his normal routine. He may be circling or
standing in a corner."
In humans, symptoms of encephalitis include a range of illnesses. Most
people have no symptoms; others get only a mild flu-like illness with
fever, headache and sore throat. For people with infection of the central
nervous system, a sudden fever and severe headache can be followed quickly
by seizures and coma.
About half of these patients die from the disease. Of those who survive,
many suffer permanent brain damage. There is no vaccine for humans.
The disease can be prevented in horses by vaccinating them twice a year,
but it is incurable once it strikes and fatal in 50 to 90 percent of the
cases. If a horse recovers from the disease, Akey said, it will be brain
damaged. Typical brain lesions did not show up under microscopic
examination in the sixth animal, Akey said, but encephalitis can not be
ruled out until virus isolation results come back from NVSL, probably
sometime next week.
There are 6 types of encephalitis, spread mainly by infected mosquitoes,
according to Akey: Eastern equine, Western equine, St. Louis, LaCrosse,
West Nile and Venezuela. [There are many more than 6 etiologic agents of
encephalitis, both of viral and of non-viral origin. - Man. Ed. DS
All 6 of the dead horses are thought to have been outside of mosquito
control areas in rural Suffolk and Chesapeake. People living in those same
areas could be at increased risk. EEE occurs mainly in young children and
in persons over age 55.
Vaccinating horses is the best way to prevent the virus, Wichman said.
"It creates a preventability bar so that it's less likely to reach us as
people," Wichman said. "Mosquitoes can bite horses and transmit it right
back to us."
The state agriculture department sent advisories reporting the facts and
recommending veterinarians statewide vaccinate horses.

VIRGINIA DEPT OF AGRICULTURE AND CONSUMER SERVICES:
In the last 2 weeks, 6 horses died in the Chesapeake and Suffolk area with
central nervous system symptoms have been referred to the Virginia
Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services' Regional Animal Health
Laboratory System for testing. Testing is not yet complete, but 3 of those
horses exhibited microscopic changes in the brain indicating a viral
encephalitis problem. Two of the horses have not yet had their brains
examined microscopically, and 1 horse had no microscopic evidence of
encephalitis.
Samples from all 6 horses have been sent to the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's (USDA) National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) in
Ames, Iowa for virus isolation and identification attempts.
Even though veterinary officials caution the current outbreak has not yet
been confirmed to be Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE), they recommend
horse owners vaccinate their animals every 6 to 12 months against the
disease. This is particularly important in the Southeastern region of
Virginia, where they recommend the 6-month vaccination interval. Although a
few cases of equine encephalitis tend to occur almost every year in
Southeastern Virginia, this is an unusually high number of cases in a short
period of time. Several possible viruses could cause this sort of
encephalitis in horses, with EEE being the most likely.
All of the equine encephalitis viruses follow a similar pattern of residing
most of the year in wild bird or mammal hosts and only becoming a problem
when there are enough mosquitoes present to transmit the virus from the
reservoir into horses or people. This in turn is related to rainfall and
temperature patterns, which this year have been favorable for the
production of mosquitoes.
Typical symptoms of encephalitis include staggering, circling, depression,
loss of appetite and sometimes fever and blindness. There is no cure for
the disease, which can kill 50-90 percent of the horses infected. Any horse
surviving the disease almost always has long term brain damage.
Fortunately, there is an excellent vaccine available to prevent this
disease in horses. The vaccine is only effective for 6 - 12 months, so
horses must be re-vaccinated at least annually and, in an area where the
disease occurs frequently, vaccination every 6 months is probably best.
Other prevention methods include destroying standing water breeding sites
for mosquitoes, use of insect repellents such as DEET, and removing animals
from mosquito infested areas during peak biting times, usually dusk to dawn.
