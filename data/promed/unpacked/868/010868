Australia: Child Attacked by Lyssavirus-infected Flying Fox near Townsville
--------------------------------------------------
A flying fox believed to be the one that wrapped itself around the head of
a 4-year-old boy at Bushland Beach near Townsville in Queensland has tested
positive for a rabies-like lyssavirus [Australain Bat Lyssavirus]. A
Tropical Public Health Unit spokeswoman last night said testing at TPH
laboratories in Brisbane had confirmed that an animal captured on Monday
night [8 Nov 2004] and handed over to Queensland Parks and Wildlife
officers on Tuesday carried the lyssavirus. "However we don't know for sure
that the bat caught was the same one involved in the attack," she said.
The boy's mother, who did not wish to be identified, said last night her
child had to have a number of vaccine injections in his face, which he
found unpleasant. She described the whole affair as "bizarre". And
according to neighbours, the boy might have been suffocated if help was not
immediately at hand.
[A female resident] of Manuka Court, Bushland Beach, said her 4-year-old
neighbour was visiting on Monday afternoon when just after 5pm a large
flying fox flew into her yard, landing in a golden cane palm about 3 metres
from the ground. [She said] her husband, who was on a nearby veranda,
commented that it was early in the day to see a flying fox. "The 4-year-old
and my 6-year-old were looking at it when the bat made just 2 flaps of its
wings and wrapped itself around the 4-year-old's face," she said. "I
immediately tried to hit it to get it off but it was stuck fast. You
couldn't even see his face. The little fellow didn't move," she said. [She
said] her husband rushed from the verandah and prised the animal from the
child. "He had about 3 puncture wounds from its teeth on his face and a cut
on the side of his head where the bat clawed him above his ear." [She] said
the attack was unprovoked and anyone, including herself or her baby she was
nursing or her son, could easily ha!
ve been the target of the flying fox, which she said appeared sick and slow.
After the ambulance was called [she] said she and her husband searched
their yard and found the flying fox had moved to another low shrub. "We
used a fishing net to catch it about 15 minutes after the attack occurred,"
she said. "We thought we had better catch it, just in case, and the
Queensland Parks people came yesterday morning (Tuesday) to pick it up."
[She] said she wanted to correct remarks made by a wildlife expert in
Tuesday's Townsville Bulletin claiming flying foxes did not attack people.
"This animal flew a couple of metres straight down and latched on to the
child without any provocation," she said. The spokeswoman for the Tropical
Public Health Unit said this was the 3rd flying fox to be involved in
incidents in the past 2 months in which people were injured, that had been
found to be carrying the lyssavirus.

[_Australian ba lyssavirus_, first isolated in 1996, is a rhabdovirus which
is classified now as a species of the genus _Lyssavirus_. It is closely
related to rabies virus (the type species of the genus) and has been
responsible for fatal rabies-like disease in at least 2 people in contact
with large Australian bats of the flying fox type. Australian bat
lyssavirus appears to be distributed along the east coast of Australia and
has been isolated from 3 of the 4 species of flying foxes. Post-exposure
treatment with standard rabies virus vaccine and rabies immune globulin is
believed to be protective and should be obligatory following any close
contact with any large Australian bat exhibiting abnormal behavior. - Mod.CP]
