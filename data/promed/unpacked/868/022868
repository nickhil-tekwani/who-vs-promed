Avian Flu outbreak declared at O'Keefe Ranch in Spallumcheen
------------------------------------------------------------
O'Keefe Ranch in Spallumcheen has declared an Avian Flu outbreak after several birds died suddenly.

In a statement Tuesday evening [20 Sep 2022], the ranch said the possibility of an outbreak was known on 17 Sept 2022 and confirmed the following day [18 Sep 2022].

The Avian Flu (H5N1) is a federally regulated disease that is spreading worldwide. The 1st case reported in B.C. was in the North Okanagan in April [2022].

The ranch says said birds remained winterized for an extended period of time to reduce exposure, and they remained quarantined in their pens for months afterward.

"Our birds are pretty spoiled," said Tambria Shortt, ranch hand.

"We knew the quarantine was hard on them when our male Tom Turkey, New Orleans, decided to sit on a clutch of chicken eggs. He was even a great mother after they hatched. This is just a really hard thing to go through."

O'Keefe Ranch began letting their birds out on a rotation basis over the summer and continued to do so in September [2022].

The sudden death of a few birds led the Ranch to notify the authorities for further investigations.

A section of the ranch will remain quarantined until the decontamination process is completed, which is expected to take several weeks or longer.

"The Ranch will remain open to the public with very clear boundaries in place," said ranch manager Sherrilee Franks.

"We feel confident the remainder of the grounds are safe and we are happy to report the other animals at the ranch have not been affected. This has been a very trying time for everyone involved and there have been many tears shed."

Avian flu cases resurfacing in Canada
-------------------------------------
Multiple communities across the country are experiencing cases of avian influenza after a quiet summer.

On 17 Sep 2022 in Ontario, for example, a case of avian flu was detected in a commercial flock in the Township of Zorra, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency reports.

It's unclear which strain of avian flu is present.

This is Ontario's 1st case of avian flu since May [2022], when the disease was detected in multiple commercial operations in York Region. Cases in Halton Region and Wellington County were also found that month [May 2022].

Manitoba has seen new cases of avian flu pop up since the summer.

On 14 and 16 Sep 2022 CFIA identified cases of the disease in the Rural Municipality of Cartier. And on 19 Sep 2022 the CFIA detected avian flu in the Rural Municipality of Bifrost-Riverton.

It's unknown which strain of the disease is affecting those flocks.

These are Manitoba's 1st cases since 16 Jun 2022 when a small flock in the Rural Municipality of Louise contracted the disease.

Poultry operations in Saskatchewan have also experienced new cases of avian flu.

The CFIA detected the illness on 9 and 12 Sep 2022 in commercial operations in the rural municipalities of Cut Knife and Laird, respectively.

CFIA also found avian flu in a small non-poultry flock in the Rural Municipality of Shellbrook on 16 Sep 2022.

Like the cases in Manitoba and Ontario, it's unclear what strain of avian flu is affecting these locations.

The September [2022] cases in Saskatchewan are the province's 1st since 25 May 2022 when avian flu was found in the Rural Municipality of Indian Head.

British Columbia has 2 new cases of avian flu since the summer.

The CFIA found cases of the disease in a commercial poultry flock in the City of Chilliwack on 12 Sep 2022 and in a small non-poultry flock on 15 Sep 2022 in the Regional District of Cariboo.

B.C. previously had confirmed cases of avian flu on 18 Jun 2022 in Langley Township.

Alberta is the only province to have sustained avian flu pressure.

The CFIA has detected cases in the province on 6 dates in September 2022 (4, 12, 15, 16, 17 and 18) in 7 different communities.

Alberta has had at least 2 cases of avian flu per month going back to April [2022]. The province had 1 case in July [2022].

Millions of birds are affected by avian flu in Canada.

As of the CFIA's 19 Sep 2022 report, Canada has 63 infected premises and 66 previously infected premises, impacting 2 363 000 birds.

Highly contagious avian flu detected in northwest Tennessee
-----------------------------------------------------------
Kentucky Department of Agriculture officials are asking western Kentucky bird and poultry owners to be on the lookout for a highly contagious avian flu that's deadly to poultry after the virus was detected in a backyard flock in northwest Tennessee.

A release from Kentucky and Tennessee agriculture officials Thursday [15 Sep 2022] states the Obion County, Tennessee flock owner notified the state veterinarian on 13 Sep 2022 of a sudden unexplained increase in deaths. The flock that tested positive for the virus consists of chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese, pheasants, and pigeons.

In response, the Tennessee state veterinarian is banning all poultry shows, exhibitions and sales in the state, which includes all events "where poultry can commingle" such as livestock sales, flea markets and swap meets.

"Issuing an order like this is never an easy decision, especially during fair season," Tennessee Agriculture Commissioner Charlie Hatcher said in a statement. "From backyard flock owners to the large commercial companies -- the poultry industry touches a lot of lives in Tennessee. This is an effort to protect all domesticated poultry in our state."

Federal and state agriculture officials are going door-to-door in a 12.4 [19.95 km] mile diameter surveillance zone to raise awareness about the virus and test other nearby flocks. The zone includes a portion of far western Kentucky. The Obion County flock is being killed to prevent the spread of the virus.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) can cause severe disease and high mortality in poultry and can spread rapidly through poultry flocks. The KDA states HPAI is not a food supply risk and the risk of humans becoming infected is very low.

[CH] raises about 126 000 chickens in 4 poultry houses in Graves County, where he said his farm is now on "lockdown." He said he has a buffer zone in place where only essential employees on his farm can enter to prevent potential spread. While Harris said his farm is somewhat isolated from other chicken farms, he worries about the potential of HPAI spreading through migratory birds. He said he knows a Fulton County commercial chicken producer who had to kill chickens earlier this year [2022] because of avian flu being detected on the operation.

"I make sure everything is disinfected when [people] come on the farm," Harris said. "It can close you down."

The KDA has online resources for how poultry owners can detect signs of avian flu and protect their flock. The toll free number to report sick or dead farm birds to the U.S. Department of Agriculture is 1-866-536-7593

Nebraska reports its 1st case of bird flu in nearly 5 months
------------------------------------------------------------
Nebraska has reported its 9th case of bird flu this year [2022], nearly 5 months after its last one.

The Nebraska Department of Agriculture said the case was reported in a backyard chicken flock in Dawes County with fewer than 50 birds.

State Veterinarian Roger Dudley said in a news release the flock has been humanely depopulated and disposed of in an approved manner. Additionally, the Agriculture Department will be establishing a 6.2-mile [9.97 km] surveillance zone around the affected premises.

The department said poultry producers in the surveillance zone should know the signs of bird flu and notify officials of any signs of sick or dying birds.

Nearly 5 million birds had to be destroyed in Nebraska this spring [2022] due to a nationwide outbreak of bird flu, but the state's last case was in late April [2022].

The disease had largely thought to have been eradicated in Nebraska and the rest of the Midwest. But it has been making a comeback over the past few weeks, having been detected in a commercial turkey flock in Minnesota in late August [2022].

Avian flu appears in flocks in 4 states, 2 provinces
----------------------------------------------------
New cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza have been confirmed in Minnesota, California, Utah and South Dakota, as well as the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan.

These new U.S. cases, which totaled 6, were reported on the website of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). All but 1 of those involved commercial turkey flocks, while the other involved a commercial broiler breeder.

South Dakota
------------
After an absence of more than 4 months, HPAI returned to commercial flocks in South Dakota on 20 Sep 2022. There were 2 cases, both of which were in commercial meat turkey flocks. There were 41 700 turkeys in one flock and 23 900 in the other.

The total number of flocks in Clark County to be affected by HPAI in 2022 now stands at 5, wth all 5 involving turkeys. The last case in the county was confirmed on 8 Apr 2022.

Statewide, South Dakota has had 38 commercial flocks hit by HPAI this year [2022] with more than 1.7 million birds affected. Prior to the 2 new Clark County cases, the last case of HPAI in the state was confirmed on 3 May 2022 in Beadle County.

Minnesota
---------
Minnesota also had 2 new cases of HPAI confirmed on 20 Sep 2022. One of those involved a flock of 42 900 commercial turkeys in Brown County and 64 600 commercial turkeys in Stearns County.

These cases are Brown County's 2nd occurrence of HPAI and Stearns County's 11th, but one Stearns County case involved a backyard flock.

Minnesota has now had 70 confirmed HPAI cases in commercial poultry flocks in 2022, with more than 3.5 million birds affected.

Utah
----
Also on 20 Sep 2022, a commercial turkey flock in Sanpete County, Utah, was affected by HPAI. This case, the 5th for the county this year [2022], involved 73 200 turkeys.

To date, all but one of Utah's cases of HPAI in commercial poultry in 2022 have involved turkeys and all but one have been in Sanpete County. The other case was confirmed in a commercial layer flock in Cache County.

The state has lost more than 1.63 million birds to HPAI since its 1st case was confirmed in April [2022].

[It is very sad, and very hard on producers to have this many birds euthanized as it affects their operations and ultimately the consumers. Likewise, while veterinarians and state employees do their job of depopulation, it can take a toll on them emotionally and physiologically. There is a toll on everyone's budget and this disease causes costs to go up for consumers and producers.

Although there are some articles included in this report acknowledging the avian flu has not been specified as HPAI, it is the current strain in circulation.

Biosecurity is the utmost of importance. Autumn migration southward is occurring, and just as the spring migration brought this disease in the spring, it is continuing to spread on the trip south for the migratory birds. Be sure your biosecurity is functioning at a very high level. - Mod.TG
