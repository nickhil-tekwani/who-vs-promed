[1] ASF spreads to a new county in Romania

The southern County of Dambovita has recorded its 1st African swine fever [ASF] outbreak, and authorities have summoned the Local Centre for Combating Disease, AGERPRES Dambovita DSVSA (Sanitary Veterinary and Food Safety Directorate) director Sandu Tolea said on Sun 16 Sep 2018.

When asked about this outbreak, Tolea answered: "I cannot give you any further information since we are at a meeting of the Local Centre for Combating Disease."

The authorities were initially alerted after a local citizen lost 2 pigs to this disease.

On Thu [13 Sep 2018], the National Sanitary Veterinary Food Safety Authority (ANSVSA) announced that the ASF outbreak involves as many as 207 localities of 12 counties with over 898 outbreaks, out of which 13 are in industrial units, one in a farm's slaughterhouse, and another in an A-type commercial exploitation, and 57 cases in wild boars.

Overall, 232 722 pigs were culled since the date confirming the virus's presence in Romania, namely 31 Jul 2017, in the northern county of Satu Mare.

Satu Mare, Salaj, Bihor (northern Romania), Tulcea, Constanta, Braila, Ialomita, Galati, Calarasi, Ilfov, Buzau and Giurgiu (southeastern Romania) are the 12 counties affected by ASF.

The 1st ASF outbreaks occurred in January 2018 in 4 households of Micula commune, and they were eradicated on 13 and 24 Aug 2018, as was an outbreak in Sarauad, all in Satu Mare County.

The President of the Oversight Committee for the Romanian Intelligence Service (SRI), Claudiu Manda, on Friday [14 Sep 2018] stated that SRI head Eduard Hellvig maintained he had conveyed the 1st piece of information related to the danger of ASF to the legal beneficiaries in June 2016.

[2] Belgium event, European alert
Date: Sun 16 Sep 2018

An outbreak of African swine fever terrorizing pig farmers in Europe has dramatically escalated with the confirmation that the deadly infectious disease has spread to Belgium.

The discovery of the highly contagious disease in 2 wild boars found dead near the town of Etalle in Gaume has sparked calls for a mass cull of that species to protect western Europe's pork industry.

The Dutch and French authorities have been put on high alert, while Belgium's farming minister, Rene Collin, has ordered a ban on hunting until mid-October 2018, along with restrictions on the movement of animals across a territory of 63 000 hectares [243 square miles] in the south of the country. Walkers have been asked to stay on footpaths, and 67 farms are being tested for signs of an outbreak.

The discovery of the disease in Europe's 2nd-largest farm in Romania last month [August 2018] resulted in the culling of 140 000 animals [see item 2].

The Belgian Syndicat Agricole General, representing Belgian farmers, has asked for the immediate "coordinated and controlled shooting of wild boar on the entire territory of Belgium."

A spokesman said: "Only then can the outbreak be isolated and limited to the zone where the virus was diagnosed. Only then can the ticking time bomb be dismantled. No other option is possible."

The government has urged calm. The European commission said it would deploy experts to coordinate with the Belgian authorities. The health commissioner, Vytenis Andriukaitis, is to be meeting with regional ministers on Monday [17 Sep 2018].

A commission spokesman said: "The Belgian authorities announced yesterday [15 Sep 2018] 2 isolated cases of African swine fever in 2 wild boar found dead in the forest in the region of Etalle. A team of experts was requested by them and will be deployed this weekend."

Kris Peeters, the Belgian minister of economy and consumers, said the government needed to assure markets for Belgian meat that the problem was under control. "We have to make clear to those countries that we will follow up the case thoroughly and take measures so that our exports are not endangered," he said.

African swine fever was wiped out in Europe in the 1990s through concerted surveillance and culling, along with a major modernisation of farming methods. It reemerged in 2014 in central and eastern Europe, with cases reported in Lithuania, Poland, Latvia and Estonia. Outbreaks were also confirmed in the east of the Czech Republic in June 2017, and in Romania and Hungary earlier this year [2018].

There have been strenuous efforts made to keep the disease away from the most intensively farmed areas of Europe in the northwest of the continent.

Germany has offered eastern European authorities assistance on disease control. Denmark has announced plans to build a fence along its border with Germany to keep the fever out should it expand that far.

There are fears that exports to non-EU countries from Europe, the world's biggest exporter of pork, could be shut down if the disease was to get into the animal population in western Europe.

The Dutch farmers organisation, LTO Netherlands, said it was the 1st time that African swine fever had been found so close to the Netherlands.

The Dutch department for agriculture said officials were keeping a close eye on developments "because Belgium is a lot closer than Romania," according to a spokesman.

In recent weeks, the Chinese authorities have ordered culls across the country and a ban on the movement of live pigs in reaction to outbreaks of African swine fever in 10 of its provinces.

[On 11 Jul 2018, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) published a scientific opinion on African swine fever (ASF) in wild boar [http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/5344]. The opinion, authored by the EFSA AHAW Panel (EFSA Panel on Animal Health and Welfare) was briefly presented in posting 20180711.5899939.

The following comments, received from AHAW (20180714.5903959), are relevant to the situation in Belgium and the related responses:

"1. Preventive measures to reduce and stabilise wild boar density, before ASF introduction, will be beneficial both in reducing the probability of exposure of the population to ASF and the efforts needed for potential emergency actions (i.e., less carcass removal) if an ASF incursion were to occur. Following focal ASF introduction, the wild boar populations should be kept undisturbed for a short period (e.g., hunting ban on all species, leave crops unharvested to provide food and shelter within the affected area), and drastic reduction of the wild boar population may be performed only ahead of the ASF advance front in the free populations. Following the decline in the epidemic, as demonstrated through passive surveillance, active population management should be reconsidered. This will reduce the chances of exposure to susceptible pigs and the efforts of emergency measures (e.g., carcass removal)."

"2. Based on practical and theoretical considerations, it is currently not possible to establish wild boar density thresholds that do not allow sustaining ASF. There are many drivers determining whether ASF can be sustained, including heterogeneous population structures and human‚Äêmediated spread, and there are still unknowns on the importance of different transmission modes in the epidemiology."

EFSA have produced an animation to inform the public about ASF and how it can be prevented: African swine fever -- how to stay one step ahead [https://youtu.be/eyQ4t1wHl2M]. - Mod.AS
