Indonesia: Avian Influenza Now Suspected as Cause of 3 Recent Deaths
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Indonesian Health Minister Siti Fadillah Supari said on Fri 15 Jul
2005 that avian influenza is now suspected in the deaths of a man and
his 2 young daughters during the past 10 days. Sardikin Giriputro,
Chief of a Health Ministry medical team, told reporters on Thu 14 Jul
2005 that at least 2 of the 3 deaths were most likely caused by acute
cluster pneumonia, not avian influenza. The health minister said
further testing has shown that avian influenza may indeed be the
cause [of the deaths]. A man died Tuesday last week at a hospital in
Tangerang, Banten Province, while his 10-year-old daughter died on
Saturday, and his 8-year-old daughter on Thursday morning. [see
comment below regarding discrepancies in reported ages of the
deceased]
In June 2005, the Indonesian government announced its 1st bird flu
case, saying a farm worker in South Sulawesi Province had been
exposed to avian influenza but was not infected by the virus [i.e.
did not develop symptoms of infection - Mod.CP].

----------------------------------------------------------------
Indonesia suspects 3 recent deaths in a single family were caused by
avian influenza, Health Minister Siti Fadillah Supari said on Friday

"We suspect it was caused by avian influenza. The 2nd test showed

Indonesia: Suspected Avian Influenza Cases Had No Contact with Poultry
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A mystery disease has claimed a father and his 2 young daughters over
the past 6 days, raising fears in the family's neighborhood in
Serpong district, Tangerang, about a possible outbreak of the deadly
avian influenza or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Amid an
ongoing investigation into the actual cause of death of her father
and younger sister, an 8-year-old girl died on Thursday morning at
Siloam Gleneagles Hospital in Karawaci, Tangerang, with a similar
respiratory ailment.
The World Health Organization and the Ministry of Health, however,
have confirmed that the girl's 37-year-old father and one-year-old
sister died of an unspecified bacterial infection, not the H5N1 bird
flu virus or SARS. The father, an employee of the Supreme Audit
Agency (BPK), died at Siloam Gleneagles Hospital on Tuesday evening,
while the younger daughter died earlier on Saturday at the Harapan
Kita Hospital in West Jakarta.
The remaining family members -- the mother and a son -- had not been
ill nor shown signs of similar symptoms as the 3 deceased, a close
relative said.
"The Siloam Gleneagles Hospital has confirmed that both the father
and the elder girl died of a respiratory infection, not avian
influenza or SARS. But we, however, are still waiting for the final
test results from the Ministry of Health," an uncle of the girls told
the media at the hospital on Thursday. He said that other family
members would not speak to the press, as they were still distressed
from the deaths. He added that it was the 8-year-old girl who first
came down with a high fever and respiratory problems. She was
admitted to the hospital on 29 Jun. Her father, who often visited
her, and her younger sister developed the same symptoms shortly
thereafter. The 2 were admitted to the hospital on 7 Jul 2005. The
one-year-old girl died after being treated for 2 days.
Deni also denied media reports that claimed that the affected family
had just returned from India and Hong Kong, where at least 298 people
have died of SARS in recent years. "According to his passport, the
father's last trip abroad was in October 2004 to Hungary without his
family," he said, adding that the deceased man was also scheduled to
visit South Africa this week on business.
Local health officials speculated on their diagnoses on Wednesday and
stated that the 3 had severe cases of pneumonia. However, the
investigating team established by the Ministry of Health are still
conducting further investigations, and those results will be
announced by the beginning of next week. "We cannot tell at this
moment which virus the family has contracted, because the samples of
their blood are still being examined in Hong Kong for laboratory
tests. But we can say that avian influenza does not spread from human
to human. Humans can only contract bird flu from poultry," explained
the team chairman Sardikin, who visited Siloam Gleneagles Hospital on
Thursday.
World Health Organization (WHO) epidemiologist Gina Samaan also
doubted it was bird flu, as the victims had not been in contact with
poultry before they died.

Indonesia: Confirmed Diagnosis Will Not Be Available for 7 to 10 Days
---------------------------------------------------------------------
A man and his 2 daughters have died of suspected avian influenza in
Indonesia, authorities said Friday [15 Jul 2005], and initial
investigations showed they had no contact with poultry, raising
concerns of possible human-to-human transmission. The victims, a
38-year-old man and his 2 daughters, ages 9 and one, would be the
country's first human fatalities linked to the virus. They lived in a
suburb of Jakarta and all died in the last week and a half, Health
Minister Siti Fadilah Supari said.
"These are suspected avian influenza cases," Supari said at a news
conference attended by officials from the World Health Organization.
"We have sent specimens to Hong Kong to confirm the results, which
will take 7 to 10 days." All were suspected of catching the deadly
H5N1 strain of avian influenza virus, she said.
Hundreds of millions of birds have died or been culled across Asia in
the last 2 years because of the bird flu virus, which also jumped to
humans, killing 51 people in Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia. Experts
say most of the deaths so far have resulted from an animal passing
the virus to a human.
But WHO has long cautioned that the virus could mutate to allow easy
transmission from person to person, which could cause it to spread
rapidly around the world. But Dr. Georg Petersen, a WHO
representative, said that while the 3 Indonesian family members had
no known contact with poultry, a more thorough investigation could
turn up evidence to the contrary. "In other countries, this is often
the case," he said.
Supari said the man's wife, his son, and their 2 maids have shown no
symptoms of the disease -- which include fever and respiratory
problems -- and tests have been carried out on more than 300 people
who were in contact with the family.
On Thursday, Indonesian authorities had denied that the deaths were
linked to avian influenza. Sapari said this was because initial tests
came out negative, and not because authorities wanted to cover up an
outbreak. "We tested, tested and tested again as is customary in this
situation," she said.
Last month, Indonesia reported its first human case of bird flu in a
poultry worker, but the man did not develop symptoms and is currently
healthy.

[The situation regarding the 3 fatalities in a single family in
Indonesia has become confused. The deaths were initially attributed
to bacterial infection, and avian influenza denied as a possible
cause. 24 hours later this opinion was reversed and avian influenza
became the presumptive diagnosis on the basis of undisclosed
diagnostic tests. Later it was indicated that confirmation of the
suspected diagnosis would not be available for several days until
further tests had been completed in Hong Kong.
Other features of the above reports (and other media reports not
reproduced here) are also conflicting. The age of one of the
daughters is given variously as one or 10 years. The family are
reported to have travelled abroad, but this has been denied by a
relative. The family are reported to have had no contact with
poultry, but this is still being investigated.
Further information is awaited. Since the only previous authenticated
human case of avian influenza in Indonesia was asymptomatic, the
presumptive diagnosis of avian influenza as the cause of the deaths
of 3 members of the same family should be regarded with caution,
since other family members appear so far to be unaffected. - Mod.CP]
