Emergence of H7N9 avian flu hints at broader threat
---------------------------------------------------
The H7N9 influenza virus did not emerge alone. Researchers have traced the evolution of the deadly avian flu currently spreading in China, and have found evidence that it developed in parallel with a similar bird flu, H7N7, which can infect mammals. Although there is no evidence that this H7N7 strain will infect humans, the authors of a study published today in Nature [Tsan-Yuk Lam, T. et al. Nature http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature12515 (2013)] say that their finding reinforces the idea that H7 avian viruses are constantly mixing and exchanging genetic material -- a process known as [sub-unit] reassortment -- in Asian poultry markets. This raises the threat that H7N7 will reassort and become able to spread to humans.

Ducks, in particular, act as living mixing bowls for avian viruses. Domestic species encounter a large catalogue of wild-bird viruses, which swap genes to form versions that can spread to chickens and to humans. Better surveillance of Chinese bird populations is needed to monitor the emergence of dangerous viruses such as H7N9, says lead author Yi Guan, an influenza specialist at the University of Hong Kong. In China, the virus has infected 135 people and resulted in 44 deaths since February [2013]. "This is a very different influenza ecosystem from other countries," says Guan. Guan's team sampled wild birds and poultry markets around Shanghai in April [2013], weeks after the H7N9 outbreak began there. The researchers collected throat and intestinal swabs from 1341 birds, including chickens, ducks, geese, pigeons, partridges and quails, plus 1006 water and faecal samples from bird markets. About 10 percent of samples tested positive for an influenza virus; of those, 15 percent were an H7 virus.

When the team sequenced the 2 viruses' genomes and compared them to other bird-flu strains, they found H7N9 and H7N7 to be hybrids of wild Eurasian waterfowl strains, such as H7N3 and H11N9. The scientists think that those viruses swapped genes in domestic ducks before spreading to chickens, where they traded genes with a common chicken virus, H9N2. That improved the viruses' ability to spread in chickens, which live in close contact with humans. So far, the latest H7N7 strain has not infected a human. But Guan and his team found that ferrets could become infected with the virus, suggesting that a spread to humans is possible.

"It really shows that the emergence of these types of viruses can happen at any time," says Camille Lebarbenchon, a viral ecologist at the University of Reunion Island in St Denis, France, who has also studied the evolution of H7N9 using archived viral sequences. David Morens, an influenza researcher and senior adviser at the US National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, says that the evolutionary pathway that the viruses followed suggests that more surveillance and better sanitation practices at poultry markets are crucial to monitoring risks to human health. But Ian Lipkin, an epidemiologist at Columbia University in New York City, says that surveillance is not a foolproof solution. "It's inevitable that something is going to slip through the cracks."

A new strain of bird flu that can infect and kill animals has been found in chickens at live poultry markets in China.

Scientists discovered the strain by accident while testing chickens, ducks, geese and other birds for the H7N9 virus that has infected more than 130 [135] people and killed 40 [44] since it was 1st detected in March [2013]. The new strain, H7N7, poses a potential threat to people, according to lab tests which found that the virus caused severe pneumonia in ferrets, which are used as proxies for humans in flu research.

An international team led by Yi Guan, a flu specialist at the University of Hong Kong, took samples from chickens, ducks, geese, pigeons, partridges and quail at markets in Shandong and Zhejiang provinces to the north and south of Shanghai, and further samples from markets in Guangdong. They found H7N9 in chickens in Rizhao, Shandong, and the new H7N7 in Wenzhou, Zhejiang. The discovery that H7N9 still lurks in chickens at markets has raised fears that it could break out again in people and evolve into a more virulent form. Genetic tests suggest that the virus arrived in China with migratory water fowl from east Asia, jumped into domestic ducks, and then into chickens on at least 2 occasions. Guan said Chinese authorities may have to close hundreds of live poultry markets for good to prevent lethal strains of bird flu spreading through the human population.

The March [2013] outbreak of H7N9 led health officials in China to close scores of live poultry markets in the Shanghai area, but many reopened within a month or 2 when cases of human infections began to fall. At the time, Keiji Fukuda, an assistant director general at the World Health Organisation, said it was unlikely the virus had "simply disappeared". Guan's study confirms the virus is still circulating in birds, alongside related viruses that may also be a danger to people. "The virus is still at large. It's still in the birds," Guan said. "We shouldn't think that it will disappear naturally."

Most people who caught H7N9 visited live poultry markets before they fell ill. Markets in Shanghai sell about 175 million chickens a year, 120 million of which are bought live, according to the city's agricultural department. Since they are the source of so many infections, Guan said, "the authorities should seriously reconsider having live poultry markets in big cities". Instead, the birds should be killed at a central slaughterhouse and sent on to market, to reduce human contact with the live animals. The Chinese government is considering closing markets in Nanjing and Suzhou as part of a pilot project, and ultimately hopes to shift consumer tastes towards frozen chicken. Writing in the journal Nature, Guan calls for long-term surveillance of viruses in birds, to give health authorities early warning of dangerous strains that emerge.

"The discovery of a novel H7N7 lineage that can infect ferrets reminds us that even if H7N9 does not return, there are risks lurking amongst the great diversity of avian influenza viruses," said Peter Horby at Oxford University's clinical research unit in Hanoi, Vietnam. "The data do all point to live poultry markets being a major source of human infections with H7N9 virus," he added. "Moving live poultry markets out of urban areas may reduce the frequency of contact between infected birds or contaminated environments and humans, but there is a range of interventions that could reduce the risks of these markets being hubs for transmission and reservoirs of infection." In the past, better cleaning procedures, bird-free "rest days", and segregation of animals at markets helped slow the spread of the H5N1 strain of bird flu.

[These reports argue that the H7N9 influenza virus did not emerge in isolation. They cite evidence that a H7N7 avian influenza virus, capable of infecting some animal species, but not yet humans, emerged at about the same time. The authors believe that their finding reinforces a prediction that H7 avian viruses are constantly mixing and exchanging genetic material by sub-unit reassortment in poultry markets throughout China. This creates a situation whereby H7N7 viruses may reassort and evolve to be able to spread in the human population. Ducks, in particular, may act as living 'mixing bowls' for avian viruses. Domestic species of ducks encounter a large variety of wild-bird viruses, which may swap genes to form reassortants that can spread to chickens and possibly onwards to humans. Genome analyses have suggested that the viruses arrived in China carried by migratory water fowl from east Asia, jumped into domestic ducks, and then into chickens on at least 2 occasions.

The authors consider the Chinese authorities may have to reduce the numbers of live poultry markets permanently in order to prevent lethal strains of bird flu spreading into the human population.

In view of this perceived danger, the authors argue both for control and restriction of open poultry markets, and additionally for dietary measures to restrict the consumption of poultry products. That might result in greater reliance on pig meat as a source of protein. Paradoxically, the original formulation of the 'mixing bowl' for the emergence of reassortant genomes dates back to the early 1970s in relation to the potential role of pigs in the generation of pandemic human influenza viruses. - Mod.CP]
