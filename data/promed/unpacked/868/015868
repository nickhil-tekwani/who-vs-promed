Republic of the Congo: suspected acute hemorrhagic fever syndrome
-----------------------------------------------------------------
As of Fri 7 Nov 2003, a total of 12 suspected cases of acute hemorrhagic
fever syndrome including 9 deaths have been reported in the districts of
Mbomo in the Cuvette Ouest Departement.

A Ministry of Health team is in the field to assess the situation and to
collect clinical samples for diagnosis. These will be tested by the
Institute de Recherches pour le Developpement (IRD) at the Centre
International de Recherches Médicales de Franceville (CIRMF), Gabon.

A National Coordination Committee to contain the outbreak has been
established in Brazzaville under the Direction Generale de la Sante,
assisted by WHO and other international partners.

Republic of the Congo: wild boar implicated in suspected Ebola outbreak
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
BRAZZAVILLE: Nine people have died in a suspected outbreak of the deadly
Ebola virus in a remote forest region of Congo Republic where 120 people
were killed by the disease earlier this year, officials said on Fri 7 Nov
2003. Health minister Alain Moka said the disease appeared to have broken
out again near Mbomo, some 700 km (440 miles) north of the central African
nation's capital Brazzaville and just across the border from Gabon. "We
just had a meeting about the resurgence of Ebola virus infection in
Cuvette-Ouest," he told reporters in Brazzaville. There is no known cure
for Ebola, which is passed on by infected body fluids and kills between 50
and 90 per cent of victims depending on the strain. The disease damages the
blood vessels and can cause bleeding, diarrhea, and shock.

"A group of hunters went into the forest and in spite of the advice given,
they collected the meat of a dead boar. Nine of the hunters died. The only
survivor is a young schoolboy who refused to touch the game," Moka said.
Scientists believe that the last Ebola outbreak in the region around Mbomo,
known as Cuvette-Ouest, was caused by the consumption of infected monkey
meat. Bushmeat is a staple among forest communities and a delicacy in many
cities. The minister said he did not yet have biological certification that
the cause of death was definitely [due to Ebola virus infection].

Ebola also killed 73 people in Gabon and the Congo from October 2001 to
February 2002. The disease is named after a river in the Democratic
Republic of Congo where it was discovered in 1976. The worst outbreak was
in that country in 1995 when more than 250 died.

[The death toll has risen from 7 to 9 since the first report dated 31 Oct
2003. Dr Dudley has added the comment that the species of suid which was
the presumptive source of the infection is unclear from this report;
possibilities include the giant forest hog _Hylochoerus meinertzhageni_ and
the bush pig _Potamochoerus larvatus_. - Mod.CP]
