The number of people dying from plague continues to rise. 52 deaths were reported at the meeting with the WHO and the Ministry of Public Health, held yesterday, 10 Dec 2014, in Ambohidahy. The latest November 2014 statistics reported 47 deaths from plague. The number of people reported infected with the disease to date, is 189 in Madagascar. 179 of these patients are suffering from bubonic plague. 5 people have been infected with pneumonic plague. The other 5 cases remain unclear. However, a source at the Ministry of Public Health remains cautious. "96 cases have now been confirmed with the Pasteur Institute in Madagascar. The number of people affected by this disease could be close to 100," confirmed the source.

Out of the 44 districts with plague, the remaining currently infected districts in the Big Island are Amparafaravola, Miarinarivo, Tsiroanomandidy, and Ankazobe. "A locality is described as an area at the end of plague when there are no cases reported 12 days after the registration of the last case," said a doctor at the Ministry of Public Health. The short-term eradication of plague in a plague outbreak remains a great challenge. "There needs to be a comprehensive plan to exterminate rodents in these districts to prevent this disease. Environmental protection such as the fight against burning bushes and forest is also crucial. But all these actions should not only be the prerogative of the Ministry of Public Health. Everyone in the country must be mobilized", the doctor suggested.

Despite the rising number of deaths, WHO is reassuring on its website. "WHO, as already pointed out in its initial statement, does not recommend any travel restrictions or fewer trade goods to and from Madagascar". According to its statement, WHO wishes to stress that all public health facilities in the country are able to support any suspected or confirmed case of plague.

[Plague is caused by the _Yersinia pestis_ bacillus, carried by rat fleas. At the start of the rainy season, currently, rats flee the sewers of Madagascar in massive numbers and take refuge in people's cottages. Care must be taken in any rodent eradication program to ensure that a flea-killing compound is part of the plan. Just as in a natural rodent die-off from _Y. pestis_, the fleas will seek alternate hosts, that is, humans.

The following paragraph is from 1998 (Chanteau S, Ratsifasoamanana L, Rasoamanana B, et al: Plague, a Reemerging Disease in Madagascar. Emerg Infect Dis 1998; 4(1): 101-4; http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/4/1/98-0114_article.htm).

"Between 1930 and 1990, bubonic plague had 'virtually disappeared' on the island due to efficient pest-control and good health management. However since 1990, an annual 200 cases are being reported and bubonic plague takes on epidemic form especially in the port of Mahajanga each year. In the capital city of Antananarivo more cases are also being notified each year since 1990. Madagascar (pop. 13 million) has accounted for 45 percent of all the cases of plague in Africa."

Fatalities related to plague usually are caused by spread of the organism from the bubo (the very painful infected lymph node which drains the area where the flea bite occurred) to the bloodstream. The bacteremia can cause a coagulopathy producing the purpura seen in the "Black Plague" and also spread to the lungs causing a hemorrhagic pneumonia. It is the pneumonia that can facilitate person-to-person transmission.

Madagascar was the location of the isolation of multi-antimicrobial resistant _Y. pestis_ in 1995 (Galimand M, Guiyoule A, Gerbaud G, et al: Multidrug resistance in _Yersinia pestis_ mediated by a transferable plasmid. N Engl J Med 1997; 337(10): 677-81; http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199709043371004). The strain was resistant to chloramphenicol, streptomycin, and tetracycline but sensitive to fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim as well as other aminoglycosides. This was an ominous observation; however, it is not clear if this naturally occurring strain has persisted or spread. - Mod.LL
