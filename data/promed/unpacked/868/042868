S Kyrgyzstan strengthens preventive measures against anthrax
------------------------------------------------------------
The press-service of the Mayor's Office of Osh city [in south west
Kyrgyzstan] informs about strengthening preventive measures against
anthrax.

The infection control teams have called for daily monitoring of meat
on the local markets. At this time, inspectors have already closed 12
butcheries for sanitary code violation, and 4 butcheries have to
suspend their work. Moreover, 3 owners of butcher's stores have been
imposed a fine at the amount of KGS 1000 [approx USD 21] . Another 6
stores were closed due to repair work.

The Ministry of Emergency Situations has distributed information
about suspected anthrax outbreak. Sanitary Service of the city
conducted cleansing works. Meat of a calf was removed and transferred
to the laboratory of the regional veterinary services. In addition,
doctors of the Medical Service are raising public awareness among the
population of the southern capital.

[I asked my colleague Dr Asankadyr Junushov, D/Biotechnology
Institute of National Academy of Sciences of Kyrgyzstan, for
background. He replied (13 Sep 2010): "The information you read is
true. Those measures are preventive ones. In general, the situation
in the South is complicated. In Jalalabad region 7 new anthrax foci
were detected. From one focus (soil sample) we isolated _Bacillus
anthracis._ Late this week I will travel to Jalalabad and Osh regions
to monitor and do sampling for our research."

Clearly an ongoing problem in the SW which suffers from constant
spill over from the many affected farms in neighbouring Uzbekistan.
And thus the Kyrgyz ongoing need for a preventive vaccination
programme in the region. And logically if the Osh mayor's office has
called for active inspection of the city's butcher's shops he must
have evidence of risk, such as, recent human/animal cases related to
unsupervised slaughter of sick animals. Presumably the 2 suspect
cases last month (August 2010) have been confirmed. - Mod.MHJ]
