Spain: nosocomial transmission of hepatitis C in cancer unit
-----------------------------------------------
The Patient Protection Office, for Madrid Community, has opened an
investigation in order to determine how 7 cancer patients contracted
hepatitis C virus at the Hospital de Alcorcon Foundation. The hepatitis C
outbreak has been denounced by various organizations, and, reported to the
local Attorney's office .
Virgilo Castilla, spokesman for the hospital, who was its medical manager
up until one month ago, and, who was present when the infections occurred
in December 2003, confirmed that there were 7 infected patients, but, also,
that there was no documentation of these infections until last February
[2004], when laboratory tests were carried out. Following the test results,
an internal investigation was opened at the Hospital, and, approximately at
the beginning of March 2004, the occurrences were reported to the Health
Council, which opened another "external investigation." The conclusions of
the external investigation have not been made public.
Several hypotheses have been proposed in order to explain the outbreak, and
it is anticipated that, in August 2004, a definitive report about the
circumstances under which these infections occurred will be issued. Dr.
Castilla said that the most feasible explanation was that the 7 patients
infected were part of a group, comprising 18 cancer patients, who were
together in the same Hospital Department. The definitive confirmation of
this outbreak was the presence of a source patient, a person who has had
hepatitis C infection for quite a long time, said Dr. Castilla.
The hospital, whose investigation is scheduled to be completed in August
2004, recognizes that there was human error involved, pointing out that the
protocol for preventing infections, which states that the use of disposable
materials, and careful device cleaning practices, "was not complied with at
some time, and, according to the 1st hypothesis, certain materials could
have contaminated other material." Dr. Castilla affirmed that there was no
needle, or syringe, re-utilization. He gave assurances that the Alcorcon
Hospital "reinforced" the protocol that mandates that used surgical
materials be disposed of properly, and stated that, until now, the
investigation has not been able to determine who was responsible for the
infection.
Margarita Retuerto, an officer from the Patient Protection Office in
Madrid, said that investigating this outbreak is a "high priority" for her
office, and, she confirmed that an official investigation "has already been
started" in order to determine the causes, and the circumstances, of this
infection. Ms. Retuerto offered a "full guarantee" for patients and
relatives that the conclusions of the investigation will be released
"quickly and clearly," and that "all responsibilities will be established"
on the basis of the aforementioned conclusions.

[Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, because it is primarily transmitted via
blood, presents risks for both nosocomial transmission to patients, and,
occupational spread to health care workers. Hemodialysis patients, in
particular, are recognized as a group at increased risk of infection with
HCV. Barril and Traver (Antiviral Res. 2003 Oct;60(2):129-34) reported
recently that, in a Multicenter Spanish Study on HCV in Dialysis, strict
adherence to universal infection control precautions proved to be adequate
to prevent nosocomial transmission of HCV. Time was the most important
factor (although interacting with the isolation measures) and was
independent of initial HCV prevalence. A thorough analysis of this type may
be necessary to identify the breakdown in infection control that led to the
spread of hepatitis C virus among patients in the cancer treatment unit
described above. - Mod.CP]
