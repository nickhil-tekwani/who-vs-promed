[2] Saudi Arabia: multidisciplinary approach pre-Hajj, media report

The Ministry of Health has been entrusted with the task of fighting the spread of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus ahead of the Haj season which witnesses mass gatherings of people from all parts of the world.

The Health Ministry will be supported by 3 ministries, Interior, Agriculture and Municipal Affairs, according to recommendations from higher authorities.

Regarding the various support functions of the 3 ministries, sources said that the mission of the Interior Ministry supports containment efforts in general and facilitates their implementation by authorities.

The Ministry of Agriculture has been assigned to implement quarantine procedures of imported camels for a period of between 10-14 days and evaluate the feasibility of testing these animals. In addition, they will study the development of a vaccine for coronavirus and ask for approval from relevant authorities to use the vaccine on young camels. They will also activate a program for the prior testing of camels.

The Agriculture Ministry will also cooperate with the provinces' governorates to make an inventory of camels, their owners and speed up the process by having the camels fitted with an electronic chip to ease the follow up procedures.

The Municipal and Rural Affairs will review livestock specifications in abattoirs to protect workers and citizens from infections according to the new information released about the link of the coronavirus with camels.

The ministry will ensure that workers are especially protected from nasal secretions. The ministry is also responsible for drafting directions and specifications to limit the number of camels and their movements until the health surveys have been completed.

[This is the 1st MERS-CoV confirmed case reported from Saudi Arabia since 29 Aug 2014, when another expat healthcare worker from Jubail was confirmed to have MERS-CoV infection. (see ProMED-mail post MERS-CoV (10): Saudi Arabia 20140904.2693605). Since that last post there have been no other confirmed cases or deaths attributable to MERS-CoV infection reported in Saudi Arabia or elsewhere in the world.

The body of evidence suggesting that the MERS-CoV has been circulating in camels long before the identified human cases continues to grow. In an early release publication in the Journal of Virology, (Corman VM et al: Rooting the Phylogenetic Tree of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus by Characterization of a Conspecific Virus from an African Bat. J Virol 2014 88(19): 11297-303; abstract available at http://jvi.asm.org/content/88/19/11297.abstract) the authors conclude that "...camels act as sources of virus for humans rather than vice versa. The majority of camels on the Arabian Peninsula is imported from the Greater Horn of Africa... The acquisition of MERS-CoV by camels from bats might have taken place in sub-Saharan Africa. Camelids may represent mixing vessels for MERS-CoV and other mammalian CoVs." In keeping with this, the focus of the enhanced MERS-CoV infection prevention activities in Saudi Arabia as part of Haj preparedness, (announced in the media report above), is the reduction of contact between potentially MERS-CoV infected camels and humans in Saudi Arabia.

While the major "outbreaks" of the MERS-CoV seen during the period April through mid-June 2014 have ended, low level transmission is ongoing. Hence, the upcoming mass gathering of millions of individuals from around the world is a cause for concern. As the most recent 2 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia were in healthcare workers, it suggests that there is still nosocomial transmission ongoing, with person-to-person transmission of the virus occurring in the healthcare environment, as well as the possible sporadic transmission that may involve contact with camels. Unfortunately information on possible exposures (such as healthcare environment, contact with another known MERS-CoV infected individual, or contact with camels or other animals) is not available on the cases reported on the MOH website.
