The 1st case of cholera in Quebec has been confirmed after the
outbreak in Haiti that has killed more than 4000 people since October
2011, but officials were quick to add there was no chance of
"retransmission" of the disease.

A woman suffering from the disease was admitted in early January 2011
to Ste. Justine Hospital because of severe diarrhea, the Centre
hospitalier de l'Universite de Montreal reported.

Upon hearing that the woman had recently been in Haiti, the emergency
room doctor suspected cholera and had her placed in isolation, as is
standard with any patient with severe diarrhea. She was given
antibiotics and re-hydrated and released after a few days in hospital.

The last recorded case of cholera in Quebec came in 2007.

[The circumstances around this imported case of _V. cholerae_ are not
clear nor is it stated where in Haiti the woman was or how long she
was there or whether she had any relationship to the recent cluster
of cases related to a wedding in the Dominican Republic. - Mod.LL]
