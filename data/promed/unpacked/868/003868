Paragonimiasis, Orange County, California, suspected from crabs imported
from Japan
----------------------------------------
We welcome any comments from colleagues in Japan or other endemic areas
through ProMED-mail. We have recently had several domestically acquired
cases of paragonimiasis associated with consumption of raw freshwater crab
imported from Japan. We are currently investigating the extent of
distribution and consumption of these raw crabs. Currently, there are
several other people who have admitted to consuming the freshwater crab
raw. As this is a rare disease in the United States, we are looking for
advice from specialists in an area where paragonimiasis is endemic on the
following questions:
1. For an asymptomatic person, would you test (serum for Ab, stool O&P)
after consumption of raw freshwater crab? If yes, how soon after ingestion
would you test?
2. If initial testing on an asymptomatic exposed person is negative, would
you do follow-up testing and when?
3. If testing is positive on an asymptomatic person, would you treat them?
4. Have cases been identified with history of consumption of flash-fried
crabs (unclear duration of frying but brief)?
5. Does the high efficacy of treatment of pulmonary paragonimiasis with
praziquantel mean that those treated have little or no sequelae or just
that the parasite is killed/cleared?
6. If there are any paragonimiasis experts from endemic countries,
especially Japan, reading this query, we would appreciate additional
assistance with specific questions about the crab in question and the area
where it is farmed.

People with active paragonimus infestation would be expected to have an
elevated eosinophil count and/or elevated total IgE, and this could be an
early screening test when active cases are suspected. - Mod.EP]
