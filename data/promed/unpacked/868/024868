On 21 Dec 2009, IDEXX Laboratories confirmed 2009 H1N1 influenza
virus in a dog in Bedford Hills, New York.

A 13-year-old dog became ill after its owner was ill with confirmed
2009 H1N1 influenza. The dog was lethargic, coughing, not eating, and
had a fever. Radiographs (x-rays) showed evidence of pneumonia. The
dog was treated with intravenous fluids, antibiotics, nebulization,
and other supportive care, and was discharged from the hospital after
48 hours of care. It is currently recovering. Tests submitted to
IDEXX Laboratories were negative for canine influenza (H3N8) but
positive for 2009 H1N1 influenza. The results were confirmed by the
Iowa State Laboratory. Read the press release at
<http://www.idexx.com/view/xhtml/en_us/smallanimal/2009/h1n1-alert.jsf>
and the case notes at
<http://www.idexx.com/view/xhtml/en_us/smallanimal/education/reference-library/case-studies/h1n1case-study.jsf>.

We are updating our 2009 H1N1 resources as we get information. These

informed of activities and findings of surveillance for H1N1
infection in the veterinary sphere. - Mod.MPP]

[It would seem that H1N1 has transitioned to canines and canine
owners have another disease to watch for in their pets. Veterinarians
have another species to consider H1N1 as the causative agent of
disease. - Mod.TG]
