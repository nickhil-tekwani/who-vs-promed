>From WHO's Outbreak Page (March 21, 1997)
Lassa fever - Sierra Leone:
Lassa fever continues to occur in Kenema District following the outbreak
during 1996. Between November 1996 and 11 March 1997 a total of 239 cases
were admitted to hospital in Kenema District and 39 (16%) died. Of these
cases, 140 with 23 deaths had occurred since 1 January 1997. A WHO mission
investigated the situation in Kenema District from 14 to 21 February to
redirect control activities, review existing surveillance activities identify
future needs and prepare a plan of action. The cooperation of NGOs based in
the area such as MERLIN, UK, have resulted in improved communications for a
rapid patient referral. Clinical care has also improved which has reduced
case fatality rate among hospitalized cases. However, ribavirin for
treatment of cases is in short supply and WHO is seeking sources for
additional supplies.
