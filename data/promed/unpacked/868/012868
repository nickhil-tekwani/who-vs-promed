French health authorities on [Sat 2 Dec 2017], ordered the recall of infant formula products that were possibly contaminated by _Salmonella_, while 20 babies aged less than 6 months have been infected by salmonella in 8 different regions of France.

The Public Health Agency of France and the General Direction for Competition, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control (DGCCRF) in an urgent press release have asked parents not to use 12 batches of Lait Picot SL lactose free (1st age 350 g), Pepti Junior lactose free (1st age 460 g), and Milumel Bio without palm oil (1st age 900 g). The details of the batches concerned are available on the health ministry's website [http://solidarites-sante.gouv.fr/actualites/presse/communiques-de-presse/article/retrait-et-rappel-de-laits-infantiles-1er-age-en-raison-d-une-possible; in French].

Parents should contact their pediatrician or doctor for advice on a replacement milk product, especially for babies who are allergic to milk proteins. In the meantime, they can go to the pharmacy where a replacement infant formula will be suggested to them, according to French health authorities.

_Salmonella_ infections occur within 3 days of ingestion, and cause gastroenteritis with vomiting, diarrhea sometimes bloody, and febrile in most cases, the health authorities said. Parents are urged to take their infants to seek medical attention in case of appearance of these signs.
