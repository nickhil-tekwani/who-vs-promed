The Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported on 6 Aug 2018 that 3 horses in Georgia have tested positive for equine infectious anemia (EIA). "The Georgia Department of Agriculture has confirmed ... EIA in 3 horses in Lamar county," the EDCC said. "The positive horses were identified through surveillance for an EIA trace initiated in another state and were euthanized. The remainder of the herd is under quarantine pending following up testing in 60 days."

Equine infectious anemia is a viral disease that attacks horses' immune systems. The virus is transmitted through the exchange of body fluids from an infected to an uninfected animal. This can occur via blood-feeding insects or the use of blood-contaminated instruments or needles.

A Coggins test screens horses' blood for antibodies that are indicative of the presence of EIA. Most US states require horses to have proof of a negative Coggins test in order to travel.

Once an animal is infected with EIA, it is infected for life and can be a reservoir for the spread of disease. Obvious clinical signs of the disease include progressive loss of condition along with muscle weakness and poor stamina. An affected horse also could show fever, depression, and anemia. There is no vaccine and no cure.

A horse diagnosed positive for EIA dies, is euthanized, or must be placed under extremely strict quarantine conditions (at least 200 yards away from other unaffected equids) for the rest of his life.

[Sadly, there is no vaccine for this disease. It is a very sad disease and in most states it is regulated with strict quarantine issues for the life of the horse or euthanasia. Perhaps we will have a vaccine some day, or dare we dream for no insects capable of transmitting this and other diseases. - Mod.TG
