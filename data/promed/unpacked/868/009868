The Directorate of Veterinary Medicine in the governorate of Kafr ash Shaykh continued on Saturday [1 Sep 2018] to immunize livestock against nodular dermatitis [lumpy skin disease (LSD)] in the centers and cities of the governorate, in the face of the disease spreading among livestock. Of the targeted 190 000 cattle, 6000 have been vaccinated.

Dr. Abdel Hakim Saleh Abu Ismail, Undersecretary of the Ministry of Veterinary Medicine in Kafr ash Shaykh, said in a statement that spraying campaigns were undertaken in the villages and cattle breeding centers to combat insect vectors, which are the main transmitters of the disease. Nodular dermatitis [LSD] causes a serious disease in cows, evidenced by skin inflammation with nodules, edema, sharp decrease in milk production, infertility and abortions. The spraying, he indicated, must be applied every week. The vaccination campaign is being carried out by 38 teams, contracted to vaccinate 190 000 cattle in the governorate.

[On 18 Aug 2018, the Egyptian daily "Youm 7" published a report describing the spread of LSD in the Al Minufiyah governorate. The disease reportedly had caused the death of dozens of cows. According to interviewed cattle breeders, the event had started 1 to 2 months earlier. The news item was translated and published on 21 Aug 2018 by ProMED-MENA (ProMED-mail's regional network for the Middle East and North Africa, in English, focusing on the Middle East and North Africa). The report, with Mod.TSO's commentary, is available at http://www.promedmail.org/post/5973465. Both governorates are situated in Egypt's Nile delta (map at https://ericschewe.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/egypt-delta-urban-rural-small.jpg).

It may be assumed that LSD is currently circulating widely in the delta region. This virus is also known to cause some clinical disease in the Asian water buffalo, of which significant numbers are kept in the Nile delta. - Mod.AS
