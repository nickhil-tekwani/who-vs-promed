The office of the Indiana state veterinarian reported on 29 Aug 2019 2 Elkhart County horses were confirmed with eastern equine encephalitis (EEE).

The 1st horse, a 6-year-old grade gelding, presented on 16 Aug 2019 with clinical signs of collapsing and becoming cast, lockjaw, and seizures. Veterinarians euthanized the unvaccinated gelding. He was confirmed positive for EEE on 23 Aug 2019.

The 2nd horse, a 3-year-old grade mare, presented on 19 Aug 2019 with mild neurologic signs, including head pressing, seizures, and thrashing. The unvaccinated mare was euthanized and confirmed positive on 27 Aug 2019.

Eastern equine encephalomyelitis is caused by the eastern equine encephalitis virus, for which wild birds are a natural reservoir. Mosquitoes that feed on EEE-infected birds can transmit the virus to humans, horses, and other birds. Horses do not develop high enough levels of these viruses in their blood to be contagious to other animals or humans. Because of the high mortality rate in horses and humans, EEE is regarded as one of the most serious mosquito-borne diseases in the United States.

Tips for preventing mosquito-borne diseases include:

- Avoid mosquito bites: Use insect repellent when outdoors, especially from dusk to dawn.
- Look for EPA-labeled products containing active ingredients such as DEET, picaridin (KBR3023), or oil of lemon eucalyptus (p-menthane 3,8-diol).
- Apply more repellent, according to label instructions, if mosquitoes start to bite.
- Mosquito-proof homes: Fix or install window and door screens, and cover or eliminate empty containers with standing water where mosquitoes can lay eggs.
- Protect your horses: Veterinarians recommend commercially available licensed vaccines against EEE for all horses in the U.S. Horses should be vaccinated at least annually (recommendations vary in high-risk areas). It's not too late this year [2019] to vaccinate your horses.
Use approved insect repellents to protect horses.
- If possible, put horses in stables, stalls, or barns during the prime mosquito exposure hours of dusk and dawn.
- Eliminate standing water, drain water troughs, and empty buckets at least weekly.
- Stock water tanks with fish that consume mosquito larvae (contact your local mosquito control for assistance), or use mosquito "dunks" (solid "donuts" of _Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis_ [BTi], which are nontoxic to horses) available at hardware stores.

A horse in York County tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis and had to be euthanized, the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported Friday [30 Aug 2019].

State health officials issued a warning this week about the rare mosquito-borne disease, which can be fatal. No human cases have been reported in Maine since 2015, but other northeast states have experienced recent cases, including one death in Massachusetts.

Maine CDC officials said the horse was not vaccinated against the disease. This was the 1st known instance of a horse in Maine contracting EEE since 2013.

"EEE, which is carried by mosquitoes, is a fatal, viral disease in horses," state veterinarian Dr. Michele Walsh said in a statement. "The virus can affect human beings if they are bitten by mosquitoes that carry the virus. People cannot acquire EEE infection from sick animals, only from the bite of an infected mosquito."

Still, officials repeated the warning for residents to take precautions against mosquito bites.

"This positive result confirms mosquitoes carrying the virus are present in Maine, which is the reason why Maine CDC urges the state's residents and visitors to take precautions to protect themselves and their animals from mosquito bites," Maine CDC Director Dr. Nirav D. Shah said in the statement. "We want everyone to take precautions while enjoying themselves this holiday weekend."

Many states, although not Maine, also have seen positive results in humans and mosquitoes for West Nile virus, which causes symptoms similar to EEE.

State officials also informed animal owners that a vaccine for EEE and West Nile virus is available for horses, and they encouraged those that have not been vaccinated in the last 6 months to get the initial shot or a booster. Officials also warned that the virus can affect specialty livestock, like llamas, alpacas, emus, ostriches, and other farm-raised birds, such as pheasants, quail and ducks. They advised owners to contact their veterinarians to discuss available vaccines and other precautions.

EEE was 1st detected in birds in Maine in 2001. In horses, the signs include stumbling or poor balance, unusual behavior and lethargy. Other signs are head pressing, circling, tremors, seizures and coma. Some species experience bloody diarrhea or sudden death. In animals, the fatality rate is 90 percent, and the survivors can have permanent brain damage.

In humans, those who develop symptoms may experience mild flu-like illness to high fever, headache, stiff neck and decreased consciousness. About one in every 3 individuals who are infected with EEE dies and many of those who recover experience lasting health problems. Individuals with symptoms suggesting an EEE infection should contact their physician immediately, although there is no vaccine for humans and no specific antiviral treatment for either EEE or West Nile virus.

CDC officials said people should minimize outdoor activity from dusk to dawn, when mosquitoes are most active. When outdoors, people should use an EPA-approved insect repellent, wear long-sleeved shirts and pants, treat clothing with Permethrin and manage mosquitoes around their property.

Health officials in Ontario County say eastern equine encephalitis [EEE] has been detected in a one-year-old horse. EEE is a virus transmitted by mosquitoes.

The infected horse is the 1st mammal in Ontario County to contract EEE. It is stabled in Farmington, but officials did not disclose where. [If this is reported as the 1st mammal, have there been birds with EEE? Birds are often considered sentinel animals. - Mod.TG]

The disease can be fatal if not treated [This applies to both humans and horses. - Mod.TG].

Public health officials say human infection is rare, but it is possible. The disease is not transmissible from horse to person, or person to horse. They also suggest horse owners should monitor their animals for signs of EEE. These signs include fever, inability to get up, refusal to eat, and change in gait.

Horse owners should also limit mosquito exposure by frequently changing water in buckets and troughs. The New York State Department of Health should be consulted about additional questions.

[The number of reported cases of EEE will likely continue until there is a freeze sufficient to kill the mosquitoes.

With the impending approach of Hurricane Dorian, it is likely we will see more of these cases on the eastern seaboard. In addition to people preparing for rain and impact of a hurricane, they should vaccinate their horses now. Even if you are not in the direct impact of this storm, the winds can drive mosquitoes long distances. Additionally, standing flood waters will be a haven for mosquito larvae.

Stock up on mosquito spray for yourself and for your horses.

Please vaccinate your horses against eastern and western equine encephalitis, West Nile virus, and tetanus. It is one vaccine, given 2-3 weeks apart. Vaccinate now. Hopefully, if you have to evacuate, you will be home in time to give the booster vaccine. - Mod.TG
