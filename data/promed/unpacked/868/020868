4 Kentucky stallions have been diagnosed with contagious equine
metritis, or CEM. The disease causes infertility in mares and may
cause spontaneous abortions. It can be treated with antibiotics and
disinfectants without killing the horse.

The organism that causes CEM was discovered 10 Dec 2008, by veterinary
pathologists at the University of Kentucky. Federal officials are
tracing horses to owners in 24 states. About 160 mares were exposed to
the 4 infected Kentucky stallions but no mares have tested positive
for CEM so far.

The only 2 outbreaks of CEM reported earlier in the USA were in 1978
in Kentucky and in 1979 in Missouri.

[The US Veterinary Services, APHIS, have submitted to the OIE on 17
Dec 2008 an "immediate notification" about this event. The
notification included the following description of the affected
population:

"Contagious equine metritis (CEM) was initially identified during
routine testing of a stallion for export of semen. A 16-year-old
stallion Quarter Horse was confirmed culture positive by the USDA
APHIS VS National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL), for
_Taylorella equigenitalis_, CEM. The affected index premises is an
equine reproduction facility. During the 2008 breeding season, 22
stallions from various States were bred on the farm. 13 of the
stallions were relocated to other states, and 9 stallions remain on
the index premises. All CEM confirmed positive animals are clinically
healthy stallions. The semen and premises are currently under
official State quarantine".

The epidemiological commentary said:

"A comprehensive epidemiological investigation is being conducted by
Kentucky Department of Agriculture and United States Department of
Agriculture (USDA) officials. The epidemiological investigation is
tracing all shipments of semen from the affected stallion and all
horses which visited the affected premises since the arrival of the
positive stallion. Numbers reported for susceptible horses are
preliminary and subject to change as the investigation continues.

The notification, including a map, is available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&this_country_code=USA&reportid=7614>.

CEM is not infectious to humans. For background, refer to
<http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/contagious_equine_metritis.pdf>.

Results of the investigations in the various, potentially exposed
premises in Kentucky and in the other involved states, and of
investigations into the origin of the index case infection, are
anticipated. - Mod.AS]
