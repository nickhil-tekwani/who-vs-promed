A veterinary practice in Kent [England] has reported an outbreak of equine atypical myopathy (EAM), a fatal condition in horses that is caused by eating sycamore seeds.

Vets at Bell Equine have been called out to 7 horses that have been suffering from the disease in the last 10 weeks, only 3 of which survived. One of the horses that didn't make it was a Connemara mare.

"She was on good grazing and had a supplement rich diet," [the mare's owner] posted on Bell Equine's Facebook page. "If only we knew how it could have been prevented. We have no way of moving our other 2 away from the trees as their fields are surrounded by sycamore trees. All we can do is keep everything crossed it doesn't strike again."

EAM was 1st diagnosed in 1985 and is caused by a toxin in sycamore seeds, which leads to massive muscle damage and fatal kidney failure, if not treated in time.

According to vet Tim Mair, the disease is more prevalent at this time of year [fall], due to the windy weather when leaves and seeds fall from the trees. The horses then pick them up while grazing.

The best way to avoid EAM is to move horses on to different grazing away from sycamore trees during autumn months.

"If this isn't possible, then we advise fencing off over-hanging sycamore trees and ensuring that adequate forage, such as hay, is available, so that horses are not tempted to eat the seeds or leaves," said Tim.

The earlier the disease is detected and treatment begins, the greater the chance of survival -- according to Tim, once the horse is recumbent it is usually too late. Treatment involves administering liquids via a drip to flush out the toxins, painkillers and anti-inflammatories.

These are the signs to look for:
- Severe stiffness or weakness unrelated to exercise, which can lead to recumbancy
- Head shaking and whinnying
- Dark red/brown urine
- Recurrent choke-like spasms
- Increased respiratory rate and effort
- Muscle twitching/sweating

[The sycamore tree of the UK is also known as the great maple or the Scottish maple. It scientific name is _Acer pseudoplatanus_. In North America it is well known that the native red maple (_Acer rubrum_), also called swamp or soft maple, is a potent killer of horses and ponies. Red maple is a tree native to the eastern half of North America. Please note these trees are of the same genus, despite common names and location.

In North America the toxic ingredient in red maple leaves is believed to be gallic acid (1). Gallic acid causes methemoglobinemia and is plentiful in both water and methanol extracts of red maple, sugar maple and silver maple, and in the extract fractions from these species that oxidize blood cells (1). Ingestion of wilted or partially dried red maple leaves from fallen or pruned branches causes lysis of the red blood cells with the subsequent development of a hemolytic anemia, which can be deadly (2).

Horses often die within 18-24 hours of ingestion of wilted leaves. Horses that remain alive for 18-24 hours after ingestion of wilted leaves will be severely depressed and cyanotic and produce dark red or brown urine. The mucous membranes are blue to brown from poor oxygenation. They suffer intravascular and extravascular hemolysis (red blood cell breakdown). The percentage of red blood cells circulating in the blood (packed cell volume [PCV]) can drop as low as 8-10 percent and the hemoglobin (Hb) concentration can be as low as 50 g/L. The normal PCV and Hb concentrations in horse blood are 28-44 percent and 112-169 g/L respectively (3). Death is due to a severe lack of oxygen delivery to vital cells from hemolysis of red blood cells, anemia and the oxidation of hemoglobin to methemoglobin, which is incapable of transporting oxygen. Of 32 horses, 19 (59 percent) died after ingesting wilted red maple leaves. The clinical signs observed included: colic, fever, followed by laminitis and disseminated intravascular coagulation. All horses had both gross and microscopic evidence of hemoglobin in their urine (hemoglobinuria) (4).

Now if we look at new research from Europe:

Toxins from the seeds of the tree _Acer pseudoplatanus_ are the likely cause of atypical myopathy (AM) in Europe, concludes a new study published this month in the Equine Veterinary Journal (EVJ) (1). The common name for this tree is sycamore in the UK, but it is also known as the sycamore maple in some other countries. There is further potential for confusion because a completely different tree, _Platanus occidentalis_, is known as the sycamore or American sycamore in the USA. The new research follows hot on the heels of a study in the USA (published online November 2012) that has linked toxins from the box elder tree (_Acer negundo_) with seasonal pasture myopathy (SPM), the US equivalent of AM (2). The discovery marks an important step for the future prevention of this fatal disease.

Atypical myopathy is a highly fatal muscle disease in the UK and Northern Europe. In 10 years, approximately 20 European countries have reported the disease. Incidences tend to occur repeatedly in the autumn and in the spring following large autumnal outbreaks. Horses that develop AM are usually kept in sparse pastures with an accumulation of dead leaves, dead wood and trees in or around the pasture, and are often not fed any supplementary hay or feed. SPM is a very similar disorder, prevalent in Midwestern USA and Eastern Canada, that is now known to be caused by the ingestion of hypoglycin A, contained in seeds from the box elder tree.

There seems to be some dispute as to whether the toxin is hypoglycin A or gallic acid. The point here is that regardless of the identified or unidentified toxic agent, the syndrome seems to be associated with the _Acer_ species of trees. Likewise, regardless of the name, atypical myopathy or seasonal pasture myopathy, these syndromes seem to be about the same.

And thus far symptomatic treatment is the only treatment available, and early prevention is the best cure.
