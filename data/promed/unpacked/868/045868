_Bilharzia_ infection outbreak in 6 communities in southern Ghana
--------------------
There is an outbreak of schistosomiasis (_Bilharzia_ infection) in 6
communities in the Abeadze Dominase sub-District of the Mfantseman District
in the Central Region. The communities are Akobima, Ohenkwa, Kawonsen,
Korado, Akropong and Dwendama. Mr. Francis Zuradam Saareson, Mfantseman
District Disease Control Officer, who briefed the GNA at Saltpond,
described the situation as serious.
He said of urine samples from 11 randomly selected children between the
ages of 8 and 12 years tested, 9 children produced visibly bloody urine,
whilst all 11 samples were positive for schistosomiasis. Mr. Saareson said
boreholes in the communities had broken down and the people had had to rely
on water from a stream, which had broken into segments due to the dry season.
According to Mr. Saareson, cattle from the surrounding villages and the
villagers themselves compete for water from the segments. He said the
Regional Biologist and the Disease Control Officer accompanied the District
Director of Health Services to the villages to evaluate the situation. Mr.
Robert Quainoo-Arthur, the District Chief Executive, who also visited the
communities, ordered immediate repair of the boreholes. Dr. Simpson Anim
Boateng, District Director of Health Service said he had applied to the
Disease Control Unit at Korle-bu for drugs for treating about 4000 people
in the communities. He commended the DCE for taking prompt action to get
the boreholes repaired. Dr. Boateng advised the people to boil water from
the stream before drinking to avoid being infected with other water-borne
diseases.

[Schistosomiasis is endemic in Ghana. Many rural health clinics lack
Praziquantel, the standard treatment, and are overburdened and ill-equipped
to respond to an outbreak of the disease. Treatment is not available free
of charge, and schistosomiasis control depends on control of the water
snails -- the intermediate host -- and treatment of human cases to prevent
excretion of _Schistosoma_ eggs into the environment. - Mod.EP]
[Schistosomiasis has emerged as a big problem since the construction of the
Volta River dam in 1964, as was also the case after construction of the Aswan
dam in Egypt. The Volta dam's cost was estimated to break even in 57 years.
It would be interesting to see how much the dam has cost the country's health
system over time. - Mod.JW]
