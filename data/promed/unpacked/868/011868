Cases of travel-associated hepatitis A in Germany: update
---------------------------------------------------------
As of Wed 8 Sep 2004, 219 cases of hepatitis A have been reported in
German tourists who stayed at a particular hotel on the Red Sea in
Egypt from mid-June to mid-August 2004 (1, 2). There is laboratory
confirmation for 203 of these cases. A further 49 cases linked with
this hotel have been reported in other countries.
The latest date of onset of illness reported is 1 Sep 2004. Over the
last week [1st week of September 2004], the travel dates of patients
have not extended further into August -- the latest date a patient
returned was 15 Aug 2004. This means that there has probably been no
further transmission subsequent to this date. Due to the relatively
long incubation time of hepatitis A (15-50 days), further cases may
come to medical attention, and so a travel history should be recorded
for patients with suspected hepatitis A.
The Robert Koch-Institut is in close contact with Egyptian
authorities and the hotel itself, where several measures have been
taken to prevent further transmission and detect the source of the
infection.
The authors would like to hear about any cases of hepatitis A that
could be related to this outbreak.
