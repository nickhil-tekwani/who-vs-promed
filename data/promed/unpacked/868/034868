Global epidemiological analysis
-------------------------------
In order to make sure financial support was adequate, EFSA (European
Food Safety Authority) launched a tender with 4 national research
institutes (from Belgium, France, Germany, and the Netherlands).
These were completed successfully by the end of December [2006].
A 1st set of results up until 31 Jan 2007 was delivered and
presented. As stated, the final reports are due 31 Mar 2007. The
initial findings reported by the EFSA bluetongue working group are that:
1. Statistical modeling showed that the initial infection occurred in
an area close to Maastricht [province of Limburg, southern
Netherlands, adjacent to the Belgian and German borders. - Mod.AS].
Difficulties in the initial diagnosis were due to the fact that the
disease was thus far not known (exotic) in the area. The exact cause
of the introduction is not known.
2. The BTV-8 virus was present in vectors (_Culicoides_ species),
which are endemic to northwestern Europe. The prevailing high
temperatures in the summer of 2006 resulted in high numbers of
various _Culicoides_ species. Thus, the warm(ing) climatic conditions
may favour the establishment of these viruses after they have been
adventitiously introduced into a new part of Europe.
3. The number of new bluetongue cases over time was equally
influenced by changes in temperatures. This resulted in an initial
peak and then a 2nd peak of new cases, which were separated by a cooler period.
4. Besides temperature, the number of observed bluetongue cases was
also related to other environmental factors such as altitude and
animal density.
5. Local spread was modeled and found to occur at a rate of about 16
km. per week. In addition, it was demonstrated that, beside animal
movement, which is subject to restrictions, wind might affect the
spread over long distances.

[As stated in this update, the exact cause (and, one may add, the
route and source) of the BTV-8 introduction into northern Europe is
not known. One wonders if future -- or retrospective --
investigations will help solving this puzzling issue. Or maybe more
serology, undertaken now within the territories between the
Mediterranean and Belgium/Limburg?!
Another puzzling issue is the exceptional clinical manifestation of
the causative agent in bovines. Have experimental infection trials,
in bovines and small ruminants, been undertaken?
The final reports of the working group -- and particularly the
entomological findings -- due shortly, are anticipated with interest. - Mod.AS]
