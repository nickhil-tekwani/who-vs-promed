The Health Protection Agency has been responding to an isolated case
of inhalation anthrax. The patient concerned is being treated in
intensive care at a London hospital.

Anthrax is a disease caused by spores that live in the environment.
It can cause a skin infection (cutaneous anthrax) or as in this case,
inhalation anthrax, when the spores are inhaled into the lungs.
Inhalation anthrax is very rare and is not passed from person to
person.

Professor Nigel Lightfoot, Chief Advisor at the Health Protection
Agency, said: "This patient makes and then plays animal skin drums
for a living. It is through making these drums that exposure to and
inhalation of anthrax spores on an imported animal hide has taken
place. The risk to others who play these drums is very low. It is the
process of removing the animal hairs during the making of drums that
can put people at risk."

"It is important that anyone who makes drums from imported animal
hides is aware of this risk and knows about the symptoms of anthrax.
Skin (cutaneous) anthrax causes a lesion which will develop from an
inflamed pimple into an ulcer with a black centre and extensive
swelling. The infection usually responds well to early treatment with
antibiotics. Inhalation anthrax begins with flu-like symptoms
followed by severe breathing difficulties and leads to blood
poisoning."

"We are working closely with the Local Authority, the NHS and this
patient's family to identify anyone else who may have been exposed to
these spores during the making of the drums. We will follow up anyone
we identify and offer them antibiotics to prevent them from becoming
ill. There is no need for members of the public, or people who play
animal skin drums, to be concerned."

Notes to Editors:
Despite the popularity of African drumming in the UK and elsewhere
over recent years, no cases of anthrax associated with these
activities have been reported. A single case of cutaneous (skin)
anthrax associated with a goat hide bongo drum purchased in Haiti
occurred in 1974: this is the only such case ever reported.

A case of inhalation anthrax occurred in 2006 in America in a man who
made drums from dried (but otherwise untreated) animal hides brought
in from West Africa. A case in August 2006 also occurred in Scotland
in a man who made drums from imported animal hides.

Anthrax infections associated with the handling of untanned animal
hides are now extremely rare in the UK. Imported animal hides from
countries where anthrax is endemic in animals (for example, in Africa
and Asia) pose a higher risk for exposure than domestic (UK origin)
hides.

Strict regulations are in place for the importation of animal hides.

[We have collectively been trying to get confirmation of this event
from the UK London papers and the BBC News websites and have seen
nothing, which is passing strange for such a normally high profile
event and the apparent source for this report. If any member has
information pro or con on this event, would they please inform us? If
correct, which is not implausible, it points up the risks that drum
makers run by using African goat hides, however obtained. And as we
have seen, they put their families at risk also. Until we get
confirmation, members should just take this report as an ongoing
reminder of a possible risk. - Mod.MHJ
