A food processing plant in Wollongong has been identified as the
source of a listeria food poisoning outbreak on Virgin Blue flights
last month [July 2009].

Food Authority of Queensland [Australia] tests revealed the listeria
bacteria [ _Listeria monocytogenes_] came from cooked, diced chicken
supplied by GMI Food Wholesalers Pty Ltd, which trades as Australian
Poultry and Food Wholesalers, Primary Industries Minister Ian
Macdonald said today [19 Aug 2009]. The company operates a food
processing plant on Auburn Street in Wollongong.

In May and June [2009], 7 people contracted listeriosis after eating
chicken wraps served on Virgin Blue flights out of Brisbane. 2 of
those passengers were pregnant women who gave birth prematurely.

Mr Macdonald said a prohibition order was placed on the company on [4
Aug 2009]. "Laboratory analysis finalised this week confirms the link
that listeria bacteria consumed by passengers on the Virgin Blue
flights originated in the chicken processed at the Wollongong-based
plant," Mr Macdonald said. "The prohibition order means the company
is forbidden from producing or selling the implicated chicken product
and any other ready-to-eat meats manufactured at the premises. This
order will remain in place until further notice. Consumers can be
assured that the contaminated product that was sent to Queensland has
been isolated and removed from the marketplace."

[The news release above is a follow-up of a prior ProMED-mail post
(Listeriosis - Australia: airline food, chicken wrap susp
20090807.2793), which reported on an outbreak of listeriosis among
airline passengers that was attributed to contaminated chicken meat
made into wraps and supplied by airline caterers in May and June
2009. The airline withdrew the implicated food at the end of June.

Contaminated cooked, diced chicken produced at a food processing
plant in Wollongong is now implicated. However, it is not stated
whether listeria was isolated at the plant, or whether a DNA
fingerprint of any strains of listeria that were isolated from the
processing plant, the patients, or chicken was done and whether the
DNA fingerprints proved to be identical. The news release above, also
does not pinpoint how the contamination occurred during the
production process. Since listeria in raw food would be killed during
cooking and the risk of listeriosis is usually greatest from
ready-to-eat products, that is, food that will not be further cooked
before eating, it is understandable that contamination occurred after
cooking at the food processing plant.

Wollongong is a seaside city located in New South Wales, Australia.
It is the 3rd largest city in New South Wales, Sydney being the
largest (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wollongong,_New_South_Wales>).
