Seattle & King County is investigating after 12 people became sick with a norovirus-like illness from The Rock Wood-Fired Pizza in Renton.

According to public health officials, 9 people from 2 separate groups reported becoming ill between 19 and 20 Feb [2022]. Three employees at The Rock Wood-Fired Pizza also came down with similar symptoms on 20 Feb [2022] but did not work while sick. Officials have not identified how the virus was spread within the restaurant. An investigation of the restaurant found no risk factors known to contribute to the spread of norovirus.

Norovirus is a highly contagious virus that frequently spreads person-to-person and is often associated with food. Norovirus illness often has a sudden onset of nausea and vomiting and/or watery diarrhea with cramps, according to public health officials. The restaurant closed on 23 Feb [2022] for a thorough cleaning and disinfection. The restaurant reopened a day later with the approval of Public Health - Seattle & King County.

[It may well be that the restaurant employees who became ill were co-primary cases rather than the source of the cluster.

Norovirus can be transmitted by
- eating food or drinking liquids that are contaminated with norovirus;
- touching surfaces or objects contaminated with norovirus and then putting your fingers in your mouth; or
- having direct contact with someone who is infected with norovirus, such as by caring for them or sharing food or eating utensils with them.

The 1st sign of norovirus is usually a sudden sick feeling, followed by forceful vomiting and watery diarrhea. Some people may also have a raised temperature (over 38 deg C / 100.4 deg F), headaches, stomach cramps, and aching limbs. Symptoms usually appear 1-2 days after exposure to infection, but they can start sooner. Most people make a full recovery within a few days. Apart from the risk of dehydration, the illness is not generally dangerous, and there are usually no long-lasting effects from norovirus infection. - Mod.LL
