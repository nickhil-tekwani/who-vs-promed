UK case of _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ with high-level resistance to azithromycin and resistance to ceftriaxone acquired abroad
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A multidrug-resistant isolate of _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ (see definition in ref 1) has been confirmed by the PHE Reference Laboratory as resistant to the current recommended dual 1st-line therapy (2). The isolate has a ceftriaxone MIC [minimum inhibitory concentration] of 0.5 mg/L and an azithromycin MIC greater than 256 mg/L (high-level azithromycin resistant, HLAziR). On wider antimicrobial susceptibility testing, the strain was susceptible only to spectinomycin. This is the 1st global report of HLAziR _N. gonorrhoeae_, which is also resistant to ceftriaxone.

The strain was isolated from a heterosexual man who had attended sexual health services in England in early 2018. The case reported one regular female partner in the UK, and a female sexual contact in Southeast Asia a month prior to symptom onset. The case was treated empirically with ceftriaxone (1 g), and subsequently with spectinomycin. At test-of-cure (TOC) the urine NAAT [nucleic acid amplification test] was negative but the throat swab was culture positive; reinfection was excluded indicating treatment failure.

The patient is being treated with IV ertapenem. The ertapenem MIC was low (0.032 mg/L) suggesting that this may be an effective therapy, although there are no defined breakpoints. The results of the next TOC investigation will be available in mid-April [2018]. Follow-up of the case and sexual contacts is on-going. The provisional test result from the UK sexual contact was negative. PHE is supporting clinical and microbiology teams in the management of the case and has formed an incident management team (IMT) to coordinate the investigation and contain spread.

Clinical laboratories should continue to refer _N. gonorrhoeae_ isolates with resistance to ceftriaxone (MIC greater than 0.125 mg/L) or azithromycin (MIC greater than 0.5 mg/L) to the PHE Reference Bacteriology at PHE Colindale for confirmation. General practitioners are reminded to refer all suspected cases of gonorrhoea to genitourinary medicine services for appropriate management according to PHE guidance [3]. Commissioners should ensure sexual health care pathways enable prompt diagnosis, culture for susceptibility testing, effective treatment, test of cure, partner notification, and a full sexually transmitted infection screen [2].

[Antimicrobial resistance in _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_, the cause of gonorrhea, has developed to all previous drugs, such as sulfonamides, penicillins, tetracyclines, macrolides, fluoroquinolones, and cefixime, as each drug was introduced in recommended treatment regimens, leaving limited options at present. Dual empiric therapy with the expanded-spectrum cephalosporin ceftriaxone plus azithromycin is currently recommended by the US CDC and the WHO, but many countries have seen decreasing susceptibility to these drugs.

A few isolates resistant to ceftriaxone (minimum inhibitory concentrations, MICs 1 mg/L or greater) have been reported worldwide, for example in Japan, France, Spain, and Australia (see http://aac.asm.org/content/60/7/4339.long). Ceftriaxone resistance was said to be the first reported in North America in 2017 in a 23-year-old Canadian woman with genital gonorrhea. The MIC of ceftriaxone was 1 mg/L. Her isolate was also resistant to ciprofloxacin (MIC = 32 mg/L), and tetracycline (MIC = 4 mg/L), but susceptible to azithromycin (MIC = 0.5 mg/L) (1). Her partner had unprotected sex during a trip to China and Thailand before their month-long relationship. Molecular typing showed that the isolate was identical to that found in the ceftriaxone- and multidrug-resistant _N. gonorrhoeae_ isolate identified in 2015 in Japan (http://aac.asm.org/content/60/7/4339.long).

In Hawaii in 2016, 5 isolates of gonococci were found that had extremely high MICs (greater than 256 microg/mL) for azithromycin and decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone (MICs 0.125-0.25 mg/L), but, nevertheless, all patients reportedly were successfully treated with 250 mg ceftriaxone plus 1 g azithromycin (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5403062/).

A study in China found the overall prevalence of isolates with both resistance to azithromycin (MIC equal to or greater than 1.0 mg/l) and reduced susceptibility to ceftriaxone (MIC equal to or greater than 0.125 mg/l) was 2.3 percent and it increased from 1.9 percent in 2013 to 3.3 percent in 2016 (http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002499).

In 2014, a gonococcal isolate resistant to both ceftriaxone (MIC = 0.5 mg/L) and azithromycin (MIC = 1.0 mg/L) was found in a patient in the UK. The patient had recently returned from Japan and failed treatment with dual empiric therapy (500 mg of ceftriaxone intramuscularly plus 1 g of azithromycin orally). The isolate was multidrug resistant, being only susceptibility to spectinomycin (http://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMc1512757) and was reported to be genetically similar to ceftriaxone/azithromycin resistant strains circulating in Japan.

The news report above describes another UK patient recently returning from Southeast Asia with a gonococcal isolate that has a ceftriaxone MIC of 0.5 mg/L , but now high-level azithromycin resistance (MIC greater than 256 mg/L). He failed treatment with 1 g of ceftriaxone and his pharyngeal gonococcal infection failed spectinomycin, although the isolate was susceptible in vitro. (However, spectinomycin, although effective for treating urogenital and anorectal gonorrhea, is known not to be effective for pharyngeal gonorrhea (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3155806). Spectinomycin is not available in the US.) The patient was then treated with ertapenem, a carbapenem antibiotic. The carbapenem antibiotics (ertapenem, imipenem, doripenem, and meropenem) are used for infections caused by difficult to treat or multidrug-resistant bacteria (such as ESBL (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase)-producing Enterobacteriaceae). The result of this course of treatment is pending.

With the increasing emergence of _N. gonorrhoeae_ strains exhibiting both resistance to ceftriaxone and azithromycin, new treatment strategies and/or drugs will obviously become a necessity in the near future.
