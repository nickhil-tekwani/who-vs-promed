The Paraguayan government on Wednesday announced measures to step up the
fight against
foot-and-mouth disease (FMD).
The government initially began destroying infected animals and
vaccinating others mostly at and around the nation's borders with
Argentina and Brazil, but now the campaign will be expanded to cover
livestock, cattle in particular, throughout the entire country.
The decision was based on "the public health situation related to the
spread of the disease in the (Mercosur) region" and is designed to
maintain Paraguay's status as a "foot-and-mouth free country" via
vaccinations as the primary method used to control the disease.
The expanded program calls for obligatory vaccinations for all livestock
susceptible to the disease, such as cattle, pigs, sheep and goats.
According to the National Animal Health Service (SENACSA), the agency in
charge of preventing the spread of the disease, more than 9.1 million
head of cattle, 1.7 million pigs, 400 000 sheep and some 122 000 goats
have been vaccinated in Paraguay.
In September, the government authorized the sale of 5 million doses of
the vaccine, demand for which has been high, said SENACSA officials,
who added nearly 4 million doses have already been sold.
SENACSA director Luis Acuna Caballero said the program will remain in
place until 2003.
The present plan of action is preferable to alternative methods not
employing vaccinations because of the nation's current economic and
financial crisis, Acuna Caballero said.
The reappearance of FMD in Paraguay was discovered 3 weeks ago at the
border with Brazil, where 27 head of cattle had to be destroyed.
