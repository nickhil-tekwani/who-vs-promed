Melilla, Rabies virus
---------------------
Report type: immediate notification
Started: 19 Oct 2022
Confirmed: 24 Oct 2022
Reported: 28 Oct 2022
Reason for notification: recurrence of a listed disease
Last occurrence: 18 Sep 2022
Causal agent: rabies virus
Serotype: RABV
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

Outbreak location: Melilla
Started: 19 Oct 2022
Ended: 23 Oct 2022
Epidemiological unit: other
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Dogs / - / 1 / 1 / - / - / -

Affected population: it is a mongrel dog of unknown origin, with a black and cinnamon coat, male, about one year old, with signs of coming from Morocco. The animal was picked up on [20 Oct 2022] and was transferred to the shelter. At that time, the animal showed an absent gaze, abnormal vocalizations and aphonia, and signs of aggressiveness. The animal died on the night of [23-24 Oct 2022] and the brain was sent to the National Microbiology Center, where it was confirmed positive for rabies on [25 Oct 2022]. One person and one animal were known to have been attacked by the animal. Based on the report of the police that captured the animal, the Melilla local police searched the city and the areas where packs of feral or stray dogs have been observed before, including the coastline, the beaches, and the promenade, without finding any feral or stray dog, except for 2 mongrel dogs with an elusive attitude, which prevented them from being captured. On [20 Oct 2022], one of these 2 dogs was captured and tested positive for rabies. According to the above, there is sufficient evidence to think that the animal had not been abandoned nor had it been seen before, which indicates that it is very possible that it had entered from Morocco.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreaks(s): introduction of new live animals

Epidemiological comments: an animal suspected to have come from Morocco that, after showing clinical signs of rabies, was captured and transferred to the shelter, where it finally died.

Control measures at event level
Domestic and wild control measures applied: surveillance within the restricted zone

Control measures different from event level: traceability, quarantine, official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Carlos III Institute of Health (national laboratory) / dogs / real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) / 24 Oct 2022 / positive

[As has been mentioned before, Spain (peninsular territory and islands) has been free of terrestrial rabies since 1978, except for the case of rabies imported from Morocco declared in June 2013. The vaccination campaigns carried out in dogs gave excellent results, eradicating the disease in the entire national territory. Only in the Autonomous Cities of Ceuta and Melilla are there sporadically imported cases of rabies, in dogs and some horses.

[For item 3 in the post, according to a media report published on 28 Oct 2022 (<tinyurl.com/448mckrw>), "This dog showed symptoms of rabies and bit several people. Those bitten were informed and taken care of by the Antirabies Center of the Institute Pasteur as soon as the 1st positive results were obtained on 26 Oct 2022, then confirmed the next day (27 Oct 2022) by the National Reference Center for Rabies at the Institute Pasteur.

ARS ÃŽle-de-France carried out health investigations to determine the people who may have been exposed to the dog during its period of contagiousness (from 5 to 25 Oct 2022). These people thus identified were contacted by the agency to clarify their exposure and organize a consultation at the anti-rabies center if necessary. Any additional people who would have visited the Assistance Refuge Animaux (ARA) shelter located at 1, rue des Paveurs in Evry-Courcouronnes in Essonne between 4 and 25 Oct 2022, who would have been in direct contact with the animal (scratches, bite, licking on wound or damaged skin or on mucous membrane) and who have not already been contacted by ARS Ile-de-France are invited to contact 0 800 811 411 which is reserved for them".

Rabies is endemic in Morocco.

"Some countries have already managed to eliminate rabies by applying strict preventative measures, but it remains present in other countries, mainly affecting wild host species.

In countries where the disease is endemic, measures should be taken to control and reduce the risk of infection in vulnerable populations (wildlife, stray and domestic animals), thus creating a barrier between the animal source and humans. Human deaths from rabies exposure can be prevented by developing and implementing a coordinated strategy against the disease.

These measures need to be implemented alongside access to human medical care and post-bite treatments. In this regard, collaboration with human health authorities, under a One Health approach is crucial to their success". (https://www.woah.org/en/disease/rabies/#ui-id-2). - Mod.CRD
