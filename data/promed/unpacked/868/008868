EXOTIC ZOONOSIS & ANIMAL DISEASE RESEARCH - USA

Responding to an increased threat to humans from bioterrorism and animal
disease, President Clinton will seek $340 million to boost research on the
diseases, administration officials said Tuesday.
Some $40 million of the White House's planned request for fiscal 2001 would
pay for building a more sophisticated research facility on Plum Island, New
York, to study diseases in large animals that can easily infect humans and
for which there are no vaccines.
The rest would be spent to upgrade the U.S. Agriculture Department's
30-year-old research facility in Ames, Iowa. Currently, some research in
Ames, including studies of anthrax and mad cow disease, is done in rented
pace in strip malls, officials said.
The proposal will appear in Clinton's budget request for fiscal 2001 that
begins on 1 Oct 2000. The extra funds for animal disease research would be
spent over a seven-year period, officials said.
Clinton is expected to unveil the 2001 budget formally on Feb. 7.
Agriculture Department officials said they needed to upgrade their
facilities to protect the $100 billion U.S. livestock industry as well as
to maintain a safe food supply.
"We're working against time," Craig Reed, administrator of the USDA's
Animal Plant Health Inspection Service, told congressional staffers.
USDA officials said they currently could not study a number of diseases,
including the Nipah virus, which killed more than 100 people in Malaysia
and devastated the country's $400 million pork industry last year. Some 1
million pigs were killed to stop the spread of the virus.
To study Nipah and other diseases that can infect humans, the USDA needs a
so-called level-four lab, where scientists wear outfits resembling space
suits that connect to overhead tubes with oxygen like those seen in the
1995 movie "Outbreak." There are no level-four labs in the United States
that can do research involving large animals.
Nipah and other diseases pose an increasing threat to U.S. producers and
the food supply because of growing international trade, and concentration
in U.S. agribusiness -- trends that can speed the spread of diseases,
officials said.
There is also growing evidence that foreign enemies are capable of using
germs to attack the U.S. food supply, according to some experts.
With most U.S. farm animals now raised in huge numbers, any disease could
spread rapidly and easily. That could cause not only huge losses in human
life but also severe economic losses in the U.S. farm economy.
Reed estimated an outbreak of hog cholera in Nebraska would cost $2 billion
in the first month alone. Hog cholera is a highly contagious animal disease
that does not infect people.
Deadly animal diseases, including foot-and-mouth disease and African swine
fever, are studied on Plum Island, run by the USDA at a cost of $14.5
million a year. About 180 workers, including 30 scientists, take government
ferries to work on the island each day.
But work on the 840-acre island, a mile off Long Island, has been
controversial. New York and Connecticut residents have kept a wary eye on
Plum Island for the 45 years it has been the site of animal testing.
Residents became even more nervous after the West Nile Virus, a disease
usually found in Africa, killed seven people in the New York City area and
sickened 50 others last year. The virus spread from birds to mosquitoes to
humans.
The Agriculture Department has sought to calm fears by holding public
hearings and tours for local government officials.
