SALMONELLOSIS, EFFECT OF ETHANOL, 2002 - PORTUGAL: CORRECTION

I received with interest from our epidemiology instructor a recent
ProMED-mail posting referring to a salmonellosis outbreak reported in
Eurosurveillance Weekly 27 Mar 2003 Vol 7 No. 13.
I worked out the odds ratios as practice for our upcoming exam and found a
discrepancy. It appears there was a typo on the Eurosurveillance site which
was conveyed in your e-mail, namely that the OR for the "Didn't drink wine"
stratum was reported as "8". This should have been "infinity" ([currently]
listed correctly in the table on the Eurosurveillance site -- the typo was
on Eurosurveillance's site, and carried over with [the ProMED-mail
posting]). <http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2003/030327.asp>
Moral of the story: don't trust everything you read on a website or e-mail,
even from a reputable epidemiology source!

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dennis Bayomi for pointing this error out,
as well as for providing us with feedback on the usefulness of ProMED-mail
for epidemiology students. Feedback such as this is very rewarding to us
at ProMED-mail. The archive of this posting has been changed to reflect
the correct odds ratio mentioned above, and we would all do well to heed
Dennis' advice to recheck data from all sources. - Mod.MPP]
