A new case of a hantavirus infection has been confirmed in the Los Lagos region, a 56 year old man from Cochamo who had a positive test that confirmed the virus that is transmitted by the long-tailed mouse. The man was cleaning out a shed in the community, where he was infected by the hantavirus. He was taken to the hospital in Concepci√≥n to be connected to mechanical ventilation and remains under treatment.

A 2nd man is a suspected case, and he remains in the Los Lagos region, where expertise is being applied to determine whether he is infected.

It is expected that during the day, there will be an announcement by the spokesperson for the SEREMI [Secretaria Regional Ministerial de Salud; regional health ministerial secretariat], Eugenia Schnake, in order to provide more details.

[There was a previous suspected case in the Los Lagos region at the end of January 2018. The specific situations under which the above individuals acquired their hantavirus infections, one while cleaning out a shed, are not stated. They likely came into contact with areas inhabited by the rodent reservoir of the virus.

Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, including the Los Lagos region, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year.

Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person, and when it is, it is only through very close physical contact, usually within the family. The commonest source of the infection is the long-tailed pygmy rice rat. Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg. - Mod.TY
