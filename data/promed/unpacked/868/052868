Kisii announces free vaccination to combat anthrax outbreak in Bobasi
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Kisii County has announced free vaccination to combat an anthrax outbreak at Sugubo in Bobasi, which has sparked animal deaths in the area. The officers have since announced restrictions on the movement of animals in the affected area to stem infections. By Saturday [7 Jan 2023], no animal was allowed in or out of Bobasi.

The constituency is vast, bordering Transmara to the West, Nyaribari Masaba and Nyaribari Chache to the North and Bonchari to the North East. It also annexes some parts of the Kisii town suburbs.

County Agriculture executive Magret Obara said already 3 cows had been reported dead. She also said villagers within Sugubo and Nyacheki have also contracted diseases after feasting on contaminated meat. They are, however, recovering in various health facilities in the subcounty, Obara said.

"We have already imposed a curfew in readiness for free vaccination of the animals from Monday 9 to 18 Jan 2023," Obara said. She advised the residents to report any further incidents of the breakout as preparations get underway to deal with it. She further cautioned them against consuming meat from animals dying from the disease.

In the Sugubo area, some locals reported deaths of their livestock in the wake of the breakout. Thomas Ongoro, a local, said they suspect their animals contracted the disease at a shared market in the border town.

Sugubo lies along the common border between Kisii and Transmara, Narok county.

[The reporting is at last catching up on events. So far, other than being unable to track any outbreaks of anthrax in previous years, there is nothing unusual. As anthrax is not contagious, any market related cases would probably have been the result of biting flies. Livestock vaccination is due to start on 8 Jan 2023. Fortunately, though there have been human cases, no people have died thanks to the medical treatment they received.

Kisii County is in the southwest corner of Kenya, close to Lake Victoria (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kisii_County). Thanks to Mahmoud. - Mod.MHJ
