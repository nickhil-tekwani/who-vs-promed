Tick-transmitted horse disease detected on South Texas ranch
------------------------------------------------------------
A tick-borne disease known as equine piroplasmosis has been confirmed
on a ranch in South Texas. Additional testing is being conducted to
determine the extent of infection. Horses on the ranch are
quarantined to their premises, and a thorough disease investigation
is underway.

Equine piroplasmosis can affect horses, donkeys, mules, or zebras and
cause clinical signs common to many diseases, including poor appetite
and weight loss. Death losses can occur. Some infected equine animals
may exhibit few or no signs of disease. Those animals that survive
the acute phase of infection may continue to carry the parasite,
which has been identified as _Theileria equi_ (formerly known as
_Babesia equi_), for long periods of time.

"Although equine piroplasmosis is not considered to be endemic in the
U.S., cases have been detected on occasion," said Dr Bob Hillman,
Texas' state veterinarian and head of the Texas Animal Health
Commission, the state's livestock and poultry health regulatory
agency. "In June [2009], equine piroplasmosis was detected in
Missouri, with a related case found in Kansas. In 2008, the infection
was detected in Florida. These cases have been closed."

"As many as 15 tick species are capable of carrying and transmitting
the blood parasite responsible for causing equine piroplasmosis," Dr
Hillman explained. "At this time, we do not know which species of
tick is responsible for transmitting infection on the South Texas
ranch. Additional blood and tick samples are being collected and will
be submitted for analysis to the National Veterinary Services
Laboratory (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa."

Dr Hillman said there is no vaccine for equine piroplasmosis, and
treatment generally is not effective against this tick-borne
infection. To avoid spread of the disease, it is important to
eliminate contact with ticks and to prevent the transfer of blood
from one equine animal to another.

"Equine owners may want to consult with their veterinarians for
recommendations on preventing tick infestation," said Dr Hillman. "If
equine animals exhibit signs of illness, a veterinarian should be
contacted, so appropriate samples may be collected for laboratory
testing. Currently, we have no indication that this tick transmitted
disease has occurred at other sites in Texas, but maintaining
vigilance for this blood parasite is necessary in determining the
extent of this disease situation."

[Equine piroplasmosis results from infection by the protozoa _Babesia
caballi_ or _B. equi_ (phylum Apicomplexa). The 2 organisms may
infect an animal concurrently.

Equine piroplasmosis is a tick-borne protozoal infection of horses.
Piroplasmosis may be difficult to diagnose, as it can cause variable
and nonspecific clinical signs. The symptoms of this disease range
from acute fever, inappetence, and malaise, to anemia and jaundice,
sudden death, or chronic weight loss and poor exercise tolerance. The
disease may be fatal in up to 20 percent of previously unexposed
animals. The tick vectors exist in the United States, and epidemics
of piroplasmosis were seen in Florida in the 1960s.

The incubation period for _B. equi_ infections is 12 to 19 days, and
infections are more severe. For _B. caballi_ infections, it is 10 to 30 days.

The clinical signs of piroplasmosis are variable and often
nonspecific. In rare peracute cases, animals may be found dead or
dying. More often, piroplasmosis presents as an acute infection, with
a fever, inappetence, malaise, labored breathing, congestion of the
mucus membranes, and small, dry feces. Anemia, jaundice,
hemoglobinuria, sweating, petechial hemorrhages on the conjunctiva, a
swollen abdomen, and posterior weakness or swaying may also be seen.
Subacute cases may have a fever (sometimes intermittent),
inappetence, malaise, weight loss, signs of mild colic, and mild
edema of the distal limbs. The mucus membranes can be pink, pale
pink, or yellow, and may have petechiae or ecchymoses. In chronic
cases, common symptoms include mild inappetence, poor exercise
tolerance, weight loss, transient fevers, and an enlarged spleen
(palpable on rectal examination). Foals infected in utero are usually
weak at birth, and rapidly develop anemia and severe jaundice.

In acute cases, the animal is usually emaciated, jaundiced, and
anemic. The liver is typically enlarged and dark orange-brown. The
spleen is enlarged, and the kidneys are pale and flabby. Petechial
hemorrhages may be seen in the kidneys, and subepicardial and
subendocardial hemorrhages in the heart. There may also be edema in
the lungs and signs of pneumonia.

The differential diagnosis for piroplasmosis includes surra, equine
infectious anemia, dourine, African horse sickness, purpura
hemorrhagica, and various plant and chemical toxicities.

Equine piroplasmosis can be diagnosed by identification of the
organisms in Giemsa stained blood or organ smears. _B. caballi_
merozoites are joined at their posterior ends, while _B. equi_
merozoites are often connected in a tetrad or "Maltese cross."
Organisms can often be found in acute infections, but may be very
difficult to find in carrier animals. In carriers, thick blood films
can sometimes be helpful.

Because _Babesia_ organisms can be difficult to detect in carriers,
serology is often the diagnostic method of choice. Serologic tests
include complement fixation, indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA), and
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). The IFA test can
distinguish between _B. equi_ and _B. cabali_.

Other methods of diagnosis include DNA probes, in vitro culture, and
the inoculation of a susceptible (preferably splenectomized) animal
with blood from a suspected carrier. In addition, pathogen-free
vector ticks can be fed on a suspect animal, and _Babesia_ identified
either in the tick or after the tick has transmitted the infection to
a susceptible animal.

Disinfectants and sanitation are not generally effective against the
spread of tick-borne infections. However, preventing the transfer of
blood from one animal to another is vital.
