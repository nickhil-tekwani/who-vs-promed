[With the addition of these 6 newly reported cases and 1 death, the total number of cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by Saudi Arabia is now at 1205 including 513 deaths. One of the 6 newly reported cases is in a healthcare worker in Riyadh. 2 of the cases are from Namas, a town in Asir province and 1 from Alkarj, a city in Al-Karj province 77 km south of Riyadh. A map of Saudi Arabia showing the locations of the cases can be found at the source URL.

According to some Twitter chatter today, both cases in Namas supposedly are associated with the ongoing outbreak in Riyadh (of note both cases have a history of contact with other cases in the 14 days preceding onset of illness). We look forward to additional information with more epidemiologic information on the cases (especially dates of onset of MERS-CoV compatible symptoms and types of contacts of patients mentioned as having contact with other case(s)) in the coming days (either in a WHO update or a Ministry weekly review). - Mod.MPP
