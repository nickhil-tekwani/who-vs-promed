More than 17 cases of acute hepatitis in children have now been identified in Wales. Public Health Wales is working with the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) as well as Public Health Scotland (PHS) and Public Health Agency (Northern Ireland) to investigate cases across the UK.

A number of hypotheses are being investigated and the information gathered so far increasingly suggests that the rise in these cases may be linked to adenovirus infection, with other factors likely to be playing a role. Dr Ardiana Gjini, consultant in communicable disease control for Public Health Wales, said: "Hepatitis can cause jaundice and inflammation of the liver, so parents and carers should be aware of the symptoms of jaundice -- including skin with a yellow tinge which is most easily seen in the whites of the eyes. We are reminding the public to familiarise themselves with this and other symptoms of hepatitis in light of these UK cases.

"In addition, the importance of maintaining normal hygiene routines, especially ensuring that children wash their hands properly, helps to reduce the spread of many common infections. Parents and carers are reminded that they should keep their children away from school and seek advice from a GP or an appropriate specialist if their child experiences any symptoms linked with hepatitis."

The total number of cases in the UK now stands at 197, 11 of whom have received a liver transplant. There have been no reports of any deaths in the UK. Among those cases, 170 have been tested for adenovirus of which 116 had adenovirus detected. There is no evidence of any link to the coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine. The majority of cases are under 5 years old and too young to have received the vaccine.

Following further investigation, there is no evidence linking dog ownership and cases of hepatitis in children. Dr Renu Bindra, Senior Medical Advisor at UKHSA, said: "It's important that parents know the likelihood of their child developing hepatitis is extremely low. However, we continue to remind everyone to be alert to the signs of hepatitis -- particularly jaundice, look for a yellow tinge in the whites of the eyes -- and contact your doctor if you are concerned. Our investigations continue to suggest that there is an association with adenovirus infection, but investigations continue to unpick the exact reason for the rise in cases."

The Hidalgo Health Secretariat confirmed that a 3-year-old minor suspected of acute hepatitis died at the La Raza hospital in Mexico City.

The health authorities are awaiting the results of the tests to determine if it was indeed a case of atypical acute hepatitis. So far, Pachuca reports 4 suspected cases of this disease of unknown origin.

The minor, from Tulancingo, Hidalgo, was transferred to Mexico City to wait for a transplant because his condition progressed rapidly and led to liver failure. In the country's capital, there are 4 possible causes of childhood hepatitis of unknown origin. Oliva López, Secretary of Health of Mexico City, reported that these are children under 8 years of age. "In the city, there are 4 that are being studied and in the country, the data was given yesterday, 17 May 2022, of 21 suspect cases, so we are of course monitoring it," explained López.

Officials said on Monday [23 May 2022] that 3 children in Alberta have now been hospitalized suffering from severe acute hepatitis not caused by known hepatitis viruses. None of the hospitalizations in Alberta has required a liver transplant and 1 of the children has since been treated and released.

A total of 10 children in Canada have been found to be suffering from the condition. 3 cases were in Alberta, 2 in Manitoba, 4 in Ontario, and 1 in Quebec. The children were between the ages of 1 and 13 years old.

All children were hospitalized after becoming sick between 3 Nov 2021, and 23 Apr 2022. 2 children have required a liver transplant.

The cases of severe acute hepatitis were not caused by known hepatitis viruses, such as hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada. The agency also said they are analyzing data to see if these reports represent an increase in the frequency of cases of severe acute hepatitis in children not caused by known hepatitis viruses.

PHAC says it's working with provinces and territories to identify cases dating back to October 2021 to match the WHO's own investigation into severe acute hepatitis in children. PHAC added its investigation has been broad, including any children with inflammation of the liver where a cause is not certain.

[4] Malaysia (Sabah State)

The sharp rise in mysterious severe hepatitis among children in the UK and the USA suggests that more cases are possible in Malaysia that has confirmed 1 case so far. Senior consultant paediatrician and researcher Dr Amar-Singh HSS told CodeBlue that while it is very difficult to speculate the potential spread of the serious liver disease, given its unclear cause, the significant increase in cases in the UK and the USA that has reported more than 100 cases each does suggest that many "more cases are possible" in Malaysia.

To date, over 348 probable cases of acute hepatitis in children have been reported in 21 countries, according to the WHO in a technical note on 10 May 2022, with 26 children requiring liver transplantation. 15 countries have reported 5 or fewer cases. It's unclear whether Malaysia is included in the WHO's list of probable cases.

On 6 May 2022, the Ministry of Health (MOH) reported severe hepatitis in a boy aged 4 in Sabah who did not have any underlying disease except COVID-19 infection, with investigations ongoing to determine if this is a case of acute hepatitis of "unknown origin" reported internationally.

The 4-year and 11-month-old Malaysian child with liver inflammation -- who had symptoms of jaundice, fever, lack of appetite, nausea, and vomiting -- sought treatment from a hospital in Sabah last March 2022 and successfully received a liver transplant on 30 Mar 2022 at a hospital in the Klang Valley after his condition deteriorated. He was discharged last 21 Apr 2022 in good health.

The liver transplant team at Universiti Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC), as well as Dr Alvin Khoh from Gleneagles Hospital in Kota Kinabalu, in a separate statement later attributed a potential link of the severe acute hepatitis in their patient to complications from COVID-19 infection.

Experts agree that severe acute hepatitis in children is uncommon, though they differ in their views on the disease's link to COVID-19 and adenovirus, a common pathogen that usually causes respiratory illness, which has been identified in at least 74 cases as of 21 Apr 2022, according to the WHO.

Dr Amar said attributing adenovirus as a possible cause for acute hepatitis of unknown origin among young children does not appear to explain the severity of the clinical picture. He noted that prior case reports of severe hepatitis due to adenovirus infection usually occur in immunocompromised children, not healthy children. "The majority of the children currently suspected to have this acute, severe hepatitis are previously healthy young children (75 percent under 5 years of age)," Dr Amar said.

As reported by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on 18 May 2022 (https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/s0518-acute-hepatitis.html), many of the American cases were identified by "look back" and were not new cases since the initial alerts.

This did not seem to be the case from recent WHO data whose (https://bit.ly/3MFpb7k) epicurve, although showing a handful of cases reported with a date of onset of illness in late 2021, began to spike upward at epidemiological week 9 of 2022 [week of 1 Mar 2022] (6 cases/week) peaked at week 15 [week of 11 Apr 2022] (44 cases) and then dropped sharply, and now as shown in this UKHSA report above, this trend appears to be continuing. As noted in the summary at https://cdn.ecdc.europa.eu/novhep-surveillance/, the WHO stated "as severe hepatitis can take some time to develop after the onset of the 1st symptoms and as investigations take time, there may be a delay in the reporting of cases. The recent decrease in cases is therefore challenging to interpret."

The most current UKHSA report of 19 May 2022 further extends the numbers but there remains more to learn. The leading candidates to be involved continue to be adenovirus serotype 41 and SARS-CoV-2 perhaps working together to produce an immunologically mediated hepatocyte injury as presented in the ProMED post "Hepatitis, undefined, global (14): children, poss. mechanisms, 2021-22 20220514.8703250." Until a definitive cause is found, it remains to be shown how many of the reported cases are due to the same etiology and how many subclinical or mild cases have occurred. The lack of clusters of cases is not easily explainable but genetic differences in individuals may be playing a role.

An example of this related to SARS-CoV-2 infection is illustrated by:
Zhang Q, Bastard P, Liu Z, et al: Inborn errors of type I IFN immunity in patients with life-threatening COVID-19. Science 2020; 370(6515): eabd4570; https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abd4570.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
"Clinical outcome upon infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) ranges from silent infection to lethal coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We have found enrichment in rare variants predicted to be loss-of-function (LOF) at the 13 human loci known to govern Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)- and interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7)-dependent type I interferon (IFN) immunity to influenza virus in 659 patients with life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia relative to 534 subjects with asymptomatic or benign infection. By testing these and other rare variants at these 13 loci, we experimentally defined LOF variants underlying autosomal-recessive or autosomal-dominant deficiencies in 23 patients (3.5%) 17 to 77 years of age. We show that human fibroblasts with mutations affecting this circuit are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. Inborn errors of TLR3- and IRF7-dependent type I IFN immunity can underlie life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia in patients with no prior severe infection."
