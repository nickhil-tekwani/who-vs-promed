We used to say that freezing was harmful to cell culture vaccines against
rabies. So, it is better to use other vials of vaccine than the frozen
ones. Equine immunoglobulins (40IU/Kg of body weight, infiltrate locally
around the bites ) are useful with the vaccine injections (intramuscular,
deltoid muscle at days 0, 3, 7, 14, 30) in this case. Post exposure
treatment against rabies should be applied as soon as possible.
