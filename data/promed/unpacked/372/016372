For the 1st time, researchers have isolated a bovine-like coronavirus
from a giraffe, confirming transmissibility from cattle to wild
ruminants. They report their findings in the May 2007 issue of the
Journal of Virology.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the _Coronaviridae_ family and are
responsible for a wide range of diseases in domestic and wild
animals, as well as common colds in humans. Bovine CoV is a member of
the same group as human CoVs, therefore emphasizing the importance of
research focusing on adaptive mutations and interspecies transmission.

In the study, CoV particles were collected from fecal samples of 3
giraffes with mild-to-severe diarrhea. One of the giraffe samples was
subjected to a series of tests and results revealed a close
biological relationship between the giraffe CoV (GiCoV-OH3) and
bovine CoV strains. Researchers then orally inoculated calves with
the giraffe coronavirus and observed severe diarrhea and virus
shedding within 2 to 3 days.
[The authors demonstrated] that wild-ruminant CoVs are biologically,
antigenically, and genetically similar to bovine CoVs from domestic
cattle, suggesting the possibility of interspecies transmission and
adaptation of CoVs to new hosts among the ruminant species.

Bovine Coronavirus (BCoV) is commonly associated with enteric and
respiratory disease in bovines throughout the world, and is
recognized as the primary etiology of calf diarrhea.
The isolate described was obtained from one out of 3 giraffes with
mild-to-severe diarrhea in a wild-animal park in the USA. Other
ruminant species (banteng, sable antelope) at the park that were
housed in a separate barn about 0.5 mi (0.8 km) from the giraffe
barn, developed a similar outbreak of diarrhea within 1 to 2 weeks
preceding the giraffe outbreak. The presence of CoV reactive with
hyperimmune antiserum to BCoV was confirmed in the feces of the sable
antelope. There were cattle farms about 2 to 5 miles (3-8 km) from
the wild-animal park, but there were no shared services or direct
traffic between the cattle farms and the park, and no information
about diarrhea outbreaks in the cattle farms.
There has been growing interest in bovine-like CoVs, particularly
interspecies transmission, following the SARS (severe acute
respiratory syndrome) outbreak in 2003, which was regarded as a
zoonotic CoV infection of animal origin. In their discussion, the
authors indicate that bovine-like CoVs may naturally infect mammalian
species and, experimentally, cause disease even in diverse avian
hosts. They raise the question of whether wild birds, ruminants, or
other species could serve as reservoirs for transmission of
bovine-like CoVs to bovine species or even to humans. - Mod.AS]
[In Africa, their natural habitat, giraffe may come into contact with
cattle by either straying out of a game park or from cattle grazing
illegally in a game park. However, in Africa, giraffe graze on the
leaves of trees, so are unlikely to have oral contact with bovine
feces on the ground, whereas in wildlife parks in the USA and other
countries I should think they are given their feed on the ground. - Mod.JW]
