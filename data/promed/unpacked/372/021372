A "flesh-eating" bacterium linked to the use of black tar heroin has killed at least 7 San Diego County residents who injected the drug since early October 2019, county health officials said [Wed 4 Dec 2019]. Between [2 Oct and 24 Nov 2019], 9 people who injected black tar heroin were hospitalized with severe myonecrosis, a soft-tissue infection that destroys muscle, health officials said. The patients ranged from 19 to 57 years old; of the 7 who died, 5 were men.

County health officials issued an advisory to the medical community to be on the lookout for additional cases of myonecrosis and wound botulism, a rare but serious illness that attacks the body's nerves and is also linked to black tar heroin use. People who use black tar heroin are not only at higher risk of dying from an overdose but also more prone to developing myonecrosis and wound botulism," Dr Wilma Wooten, the county's chief public health officer, said in a statement.

There was one confirmed case in October [2019] of wound botulism linked to black tar heroin use in the county, health officials said. But there have been 13 probable or confirmed wound botulism cases in Southern California since 1 Sep 2019. Most of those cases were among black tar heroin users. "The sources of the black tar heroin are unknown," county health officials said in a statement. "Investigation is continuing and additional cases may occur."

Symptoms of myonecrosis include severe pain in the area around a wound or injection site; swelling in the area around a wound; pale skin that quickly turns gray, dark red, purple, or black; blisters with foul-smelling discharge; fever; air under the skin; excessive sweating; and increased heart rate. Left untreated, myonecrosis can spread through the body and cause people to go into shock. It can lead to amputations or death.

Symptoms of wound botulism can sometimes be mistaken for a drug overdose and occur within days or weeks of injecting contaminated drugs. Symptoms can include weak or drooping eyelids; blurred or double vision; dry mouth; sore throat; slurred speech; trouble swallowing; difficulty breathing; and progressive symmetric paralysis that begins at the face and head and travels down the body. Left untreated, symptoms may lead to paralysis of the respiratory muscles, arms, legs, and torso, and can cause death.

County health officials said drug users experiencing symptoms of myonecrosis or wound botulism should seek immediate medical attention at the nearest emergency department.

[Gas gangrene is a rapidly progressive, frequently fatal, necrotizing infection of muscle that is usually caused by _Clostridium perfringens_, and thus is also called clostridial myonecrosis. Gas gangrene usually involves traumatic civilian and war wounds, but can also involve surgical wounds, particularly after colon or biliary surgery. Clostridial uterine myonecrosis can complicate a septic abortion.

"Rarely, outbreaks of gas gangrene have been reported among injecting illicit drug users, usually of heroin (see http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/gangrene-bacterium-blamed-for-drug-deaths-715317.html) or methamphetamine; gas gangrene has also been reported following injections of medications, such as epinephrine, that can cause tissue ischemia.

"Clostridia are commonly present in soil and in the normal colon, and frequently contaminate open, traumatic wounds, although rarely produce gas gangrene. (Gas gangrene develops in less than 1-2 percent of these wounds.) Devitalized tissue, ischemia, foreign bodies in the wound, and concurrent wound infection with other microorganisms facilitate the growth of clostridia and their elaboration of toxins.

"Rapid diagnosis is facilitated by characteristic clinical findings, identification of typical 'box-car'-shaped Gram-positive bacilli in aspirates from the infected muscle or bullae, and muscle involvement and gas in the muscle on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the wound. Treatment includes prompt and extensive surgical debridement of all necrotic tissue and removal of foreign bodies from the wound, accompanied by appropriate antibiotic therapy.

Most drug-related cases of wound botulism are related to black tar heroin, which is injected subcutaneously instead of intravenously.

Black tar heroin (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_tar_heroin) is heroin acetate. "Other forms of heroin require additional steps of purification post acetylation. With black tar, the product's processing stops immediately after acetylation. Its unique consistency, however, is due to acetylation without a reflux apparatus. As in "homebake heroin" in Australia and New Zealand, the crude acetylation results in a gooey mass. Black tar is a type holds a variable admixture of morphine derivatives, predominantly 6-MAM (6-monoacetylmorphine), which is another result of crude acetylation. The lack of proper reflux during acetylation fails to remove much of the moisture retained in the acetylating agent, glacial acetic acid."

"Black tar heroin is often produced in Latin America and is most commonly found in the western and southern parts of the USA, while also being occasionally found in western Canada and Europe. It has a varying consistency depending on manufacturing methods, cutting agents, and moisture levels, ranging in quality from a black-brown tarry goo in unrefined form to a uniform, light-brown powder when further processed and cut with lactose.

"People who intravenously inject black tar heroin are at higher risk of venous sclerosis than those who inject powder heroin. In this condition, the veins narrow and harden, which makes repeated injection there nearly impossible. Researchers at the University of California at San Francisco have found that the rapidity with which black tar heroin destroys veins, along with its gummier consistency, may put people who inject it at a lower risk of HIV infection because they may be forced to inject subcutaneously (rather than into veins), and needles must be thoroughly rinsed free of 'black tar' between injections if new sterilized ones are not available.

"The presence of 6-monoacetylcodeine found in tar heroin has not been tested in humans but has been shown to be toxic alone and more toxic when mixed with mono- or di-acetyl morphine, potentially making tar more toxic than refined diamorphine. At least one study has drawn attention to lower rates of HIV infection among drug injectors in which black tar heroin is the major form of street-available heroin, suggesting that this may be due to the need to heat black tar heroin to dissolve it (which also inactivates any HIV present in the solution).

"However, black tar heroin injectors can be at increased risk of life-threatening bacterial infections, in particular, necrotizing soft tissue infection. The practice of 'skin-popping,' or subcutaneous injection, predisposes to necrotizing fasciitis or necrotizing cellulitis from _C. perfringens_, while deep intramuscular injection predisposes to necrotizing myositis. Tar heroin injection can also be associated with _C. botulinum_ infection." - Mod.LL
