Global panel: H5N1 surge in Egypt likely due to more poultry contact
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The recent dramatic increase in human cases of H5N1 avian flu in Egypt is likely not related to virus mutations or changing epidemiology but rather to more people becoming exposed to infected poultry, according to the joint findings of experts from 6 leading organizations, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in a press release today [15 May 2015].

From November 2014 through April 2015, 165 Egyptian H5N1 cases were reported, including 48 deaths, the WHO release said. (That number, though, is a bit of an undercount, according to FluTrackers, an infectious disease news message board that has been tracking cases closely. FluTrackers, which bases its numbers on official reports, says at least 175 cases have occurred in that period. But either way, the surge is unprecedented in the history of the disease.)

"Based on all the evidence we have, we believe the upsurge is not explained by changes in the virus itself," said Keiji Fukuda, MD, MPH, WHO assistant director-general for health security and head of the H5N1 investigation team in Egypt, which included WHO, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and US Naval Medical Research Unit 3 (NAMRU-3) in Cairo.

"The most likely reason for the increase in cases is that more poultry in Egypt are infected by H5N1 and so more people are exposed to this virus," Fukuda added. "Coupled with insufficient awareness, behavioural patterns, and inadequate precautions taken by humans when interacting with poultry, this explains what we are seeing." WHO noted, "There are indications that H5N1 is circulating in all sectors of poultry production and in all parts of Egypt."

The expert panel determined these factors about the surge of cases:
- although human-to-human transmission cannot be excluded, key epidemiologic and demographic features of cases did not change significantly;
- there was no evidence of transmission from patients to healthcare workers;
- about 70 per cent of cases involved known exposure to infected backyard poultry;
- genetic sequence data revealed no changes to indicate more efficient human-to-human transmission.
