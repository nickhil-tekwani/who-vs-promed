To date [Sun 3 Oct 2021], 7 cases of yellow fever [YF] have been reported in the Maturin de Monagas municipality, according to the NGO [non-governmental organisation], Medicos Unidos Vzla.

The localities where human and monkey cases have been confirmed:
1) Carapal del Tigre [Anzoategui state]: 1 human and 2 positive monkeys;
2) the Merey of Amana [Monagas state]: 6 humans and 2 positive monkeys.

The death of araguatos, or howler monkeys, has previously been reported in Monagas and Anzoategui.

A total of 10 confirmed epizootics of non-human primates (araguato monkeys) have been reported in Venezuela: 7 in Monagas and 3 in Anzoategui, with 2 confirmed by PCR laboratory (both from Edo Monagas) and 8 confirmed by epidemiological link.

Yellow fever vaccination coverage for Venezuela is 75%, and 78% in Monagas.

These are the 1st cases that have been reported since November 2019, when an indigenous Pemon was infected in Bolivar state (see Yellow fever - Americas (12): Venezuela, WHO details 20191123.6793620).

Yellow fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic fever. Symptoms of yellow fever (fever, chills, headache, backache, and muscle aches) develop 3-6 days after infection. About 15% of people infected with yellow fever virus will develop severe illness that can lead to liver disease, bleeding, shock, organ failure, yellowing skin (jaundice), and sometimes death. Diagnosis is based on symptoms, laboratory testing, and travel history. Yellow fever virus spreads through the bites of infected mosquitoes.

[Yellow fever (YF) virus is endemic in Venezuela, as it is in many South American countries. The above report indicates that both humans and howler monkeys have been infected by YF virus. There is no indication if the human cases were fatal. Howler monkeys are susceptible to infection by the virus and die. The howler monkey cases reported above were doubtless fatal ones. There is no indication if vaccination efforts are being made in the localities where the human or howler monkey cases occurred.

YF cases have occurred sporadically in Venezuela. Previous ProMED reports of YF in Venezuela were in 2010, in Anzoategui state, where there were 3 probable YF cases in monkeys (see Yellow fever - South America: Venezuela (AN) monkey, susp 20101112.4114) and a human case in Bolivar state in 2019 (see Yellow fever - Americas (12): Venezuela, WHO details 20191123.6793620).

Presumably, the above human cases are ones of spillover from the sylvan (forest) transmission cycle. Maintenance of a high level (80-90%) of coverage is essential to prevent cases and avoid outbreaks involving the urban cycle with _Aedes aegypti_ transmission. - Mod.TY
