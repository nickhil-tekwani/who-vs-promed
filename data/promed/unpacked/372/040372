Dominican Republic: Detection of West Nile Virus Antibodies in Birds
--------------------------------------------------------------------
SANTO DOMINGO: The Ministry of Health issued an epidemiologic alert
yesterday for febrile illnesses in humans after finding antibodies against
West Nile virus (WNV) in birds in the Los Haitises National Park. West
Nile virus infection is transmitted to humans through bites from the
mosquito _Culex Quinquefasciatus_ which is abundant in the country.
Health authorities cautioned the public not to be alarmed, but to take
precautionary measures, such as elimination of mosquito breeding sites,
cleaning household surroundings and seeking medical attention when
developing symptoms such as fever, headache, and muscular pains. This
virus produces diseases that affect the central nervous system and is more
severe in persons of older age groups or those with illnesses that affect
their immune systems. The country has also issued alerts to the Ministries
of Health of surrounding countries, as this is the first finding of WNV
outside of the continental territory of the United States [this should
state continental North America as the virus has been identified in Canada
in 2002, and in the past several days in Northern Mexico near the border
with the USA [see ProMED-mail posting: West Nile virus, birds - Mexico
(north) 20030315.0640. - Mod.MPP] and therefore its [WNV] behavior in the
region is not yet known.
The virus was identified for the first time in Uganda in 1937; in the 1950s
in Europe, and arrived in the United States in 1999 where during last year
[2002] there were 4000 cases reported in humans, of which there were 266
deaths associated with WNV infection. [There were 4161 cases and 277 deaths
reported to have occurred in the USA during 2002 as of data available on
the CDC WNV website current to 13 Mar 2003
<http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/wncount.htm> - Mod.MPP]
The health authorities stated that a laboratory analysis conducted in the
United States last February [2003?], confirmed that some blood specimens
collected in November [2002?] from birds in the Los Haitises National Park
had specific antibodies against WNV. This finding demonstrates that WNV
has been transmitted locally to birds resident in the country.
Among the steps that the country is taking through Provincial and Area
[county] level Health division is the establishment of epidemiologic
surveillance activities to detect human illnesses presenting as fever,
headache and muscular pains, and aseptic meningitis, especially in
geographic areas near to Los Haitises and other national parks. This alert
has been initiated to implement a surveillance system that will detect an
outbreak in the early stages. A team from the University of Kansas of the
USA is due to arrive next week and will accompany the health authorities
from the Direction of Wild Life and Zoological Park, in the evaluation of a
model for epidemiologic surveillance [in humans and birds].
The Dominican Republic receives approximately 18 species of migratory
birds. The director of CENCET presumes that WNV arrived [in the Dominican
Republic] with these migratory birds from other infected
countries. Guillermo Gonzalvez explained that after establishing an
agreement of cooperation with the University of Kansas and the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the USA, between September and
November of last year [2002], a total of 152 specimens was collected from
37 different bird families. These specimens were sent to the CDC
laboratory, and nine of the specimens collected were positive for
flaviviruses, and five of these were confirmed to have antibodies against
WNV. The virus itself was not isolated, but the detection of specific
antibodies against WNV indicates that WNV is circulating in the Criolle
[local] ecosystem. Birds from which the WNV antibodies were identified are
known to inhabit populated areas such as Chuachua.

Dominican Republic: Rare Avian Species At Risk from West Nile Virus
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ornithologists of the University of Kansas in the United States, and at the
National Zoological Park, consider that one of the possible negative
impacts of the appearance of WNV in the Dominican Republic will be the
effect on bird population currently in need of conservation, since many may
become ill and die. They emphasized that the country has several species in
danger of extinction, of which those of most concern include 2 species of
crows, a duck, and the Ridgway sparrowhawk that almost exclusively lives in
the the Los Haitises National Park. However, at the present time, there
have been no birds, mammals or human beings identified with illness
associated with WNV infection.
