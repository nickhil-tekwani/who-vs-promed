[1] Case update
- Thu 16 Aug 2018. Epidemiological situation report, 15 Aug 2018, DRC Ministry of Health
[in French, machine trans., edited]
https://us13.campaign-archive.com/?u=89e5755d2cca4840b1af93176&id=051b0b8bd8

A total of 78 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, with 51 confirmed and 27 probable. In addition, 24 suspected cases are under investigation.

Also, there are 5 new confirmed cases in Mabalako, including one health staff member from the Mangina Reference Health Center. All new confirmed cases are probable and known case contacts.

There were also 2 deaths of confirmed cases in Beni reported.

On Wed 15 Aug [2018], the Minister of Health, Dr. Oly Ilunga Kalenga, met with Ms. Jennifer Haskell, Chargé d'Affaires of the Embassy of the United States in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC); Dr. Robert Redfield Jr., Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); and Dr. Raimi Ewetola, Country Director of the CDC in the DRC. Because of its size and central position in Africa, the DRC has an important role to play in global health security. Discussions focused on bilateral cooperation between the Ministry of Health and the CDC, CDC training programs for field epidemiologists, and future perspectives for strengthening collaboration.

The day after this 1st interview, the Minister of Health led the American delegation to the heart of the response, in Beni in North Kivu province. After a presentation of the epidemiological situation through coordination, the guests went to the Beni General Referral Hospital where they visited the new Ebola Treatment Center.

After the meeting with the group in Beni, the Minister of Health traveled to Bunia, capital of the Ituri province, where a 1st confirmed case of Ebola was reported 12 Aug 2018. The health minister was welcomed by a provincial government delegation including the governor, the deputy governor, the provincial minister of health and the provincial minister of the interior. Since the declaration of the epidemic in North Kivu province, the provincial government of Ituri had set up crisis coordination and strengthened prevention and surveillance measures because of the proximity between the epicenter of the epidemic in Mangina and the Mandima Health Zone in Ituri province.

In fact, the health zones of Mangina and Mandima are separated by less than 400 meters, and population movements are frequent. Many farmers live with their families in Mangina but work in fields in Mandima. The Minister of Health congratulated the provincial government for its proactivity that has already saved several lives.

Since vaccination began on 8 Aug 2018, 316 people have been vaccinated, including 176 in Mabalako, 100 in Beni, and 40 in Mandima.

- Thu 16 Aug 2018. News Scan. Ebola total grows
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Reporting and Policy), edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2018/08/news-scan-aug-16-2018

The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) Ministry of Health (MOH) released a new update late yesterday [15 Aug 2018] afternoon on the growing Ebola outbreak in the eastern region of the country, noting 7 new confirmed cases, one of whom is a healthcare worker at Mangina Reference Health Center.

The outbreak total now stands at 73 cases, of which 46 are confirmed and 27 are probable. In addition, 43 deaths have been reported, and health officials are investigating 40 suspected cases. All 7 new cases are from Mabalako and involve probable and known contacts of previously confirmed cases.

Yesterday, the MOH confirmed that ring vaccination began in the affected health zone of Ituri province. Earlier this week, Ituri confirmed 6 cases of Ebola, including one death. ...[more]

- Thu 16 Aug 2018. MSF opens Ebola treatment center in response to outbreak in North Kivu
[Doctors Without Borders/MSF, edited]
https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/news-stories/news/drc-msf-opens-ebola-treatment-center-response-outbreak-north-kivu

The international medical humanitarian organization Doctors Without Borders / Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) opened an Ebola treatment center on Tue 14 Aug [2018] in Mangina, a small town considered to be the epicenter of the outbreak in North Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). A total of 37 patients are currently hospitalized in this facility, with 31 of those cases confirmed and 6 suspected.

"Among our patients, we have several colleagues from the Congolese health system," said Gwenola Seroux, MSF emergency programs coordinator. "They were the first to respond, and some were exposed to the virus."

Before this center opened, MSF was working in an isolation unit in the area to improve safety and implement protection measures. All patients from that unit have been transferred to the new Ebola treatment center.

To address some of the response priorities set by health authorities, MSF is working along the route between Mambasa and Makeke in Ituri province, visiting health centers to set up isolation rooms, undertaking surveillance activities, and liaising with community health workers to raise awareness about Ebola. Infection prevention and control protocols are also being reinforced in the region -- and in MSF's existing non-Ebola projects in the area -- to prevent further spread of Ebola, which is a critical pillar of the Ebola outbreak response.

In neighboring Uganda, MSF is part of the national task force to ensure effective preparations are in place to tackle the risk of cross-border contagion. ...[more]

[2] Recommendations
- Wed 15 Aug 2018. Opinion | Ebola responders must learn language lessons from the 2014 epidemic
[IRIN, edited]
https://www.irinnews.org/opinion/2018/08/15/opinion-ebola-responders-language-epidemic-congo-africa
[Byline: Aimee Ansari]

Amid the [West African] epidemic, UNICEF and Catholic Relief Services published ominous survey results: In Sierra Leone, one of the hardest-hit countries, 30% of respondents believed Ebola was transmitted by mosquitoes; another 30% believed it was an airborne disease. Moreover, around 4 of 10 respondents (42%) believed hot salt-water baths were an effective cure.

Many reports evaluating how different agencies responded to the epidemic pointed to a lack of community engagement or understanding of local culture as key early failures. A big part of that failure was the inability of aid workers to converse in local languages.

In the 3 most affected countries -- Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone -- people speak more than 90 languages. Literacy levels are low, especially in the official national languages (French and English), and yet Ebola-related materials were mostly in written form in those languages. This early shortage of information for non-literate people and speakers of minority languages left significant swathes of the population in deadly ignorance.

ACAPS, a non-profit group specialising in research and analysis of the humanitarian sector, found that in both Liberia and Sierra Leone women died in greater numbers than men at the beginning of the outbreak, in part because they had less access to information and communication channels.

Now in 2018, 4 years later, we are again responding to Ebola outbreaks: This year there have been 2 in the Democratic Republic of Congo, one of the most linguistically diverse countries in the world.

In the area affected by the latest outbreak, Beni Territory, the predominant languages are Swahili, Nande, and Mbuba. There are barely any trained translators for Nande and Mbuba, languages not supported by Google Translate, Microsoft Translator, Facebook, or Amazon.

Community engagement is now a priority activity for some agencies. They write guideline documents and blogs about it, discuss local communication preferences, and make it clear they are trying to learn the lessons of the past. Maps showing what languages are spoken where have proved useful to organisations working to curb the spread of the virus. ...[more]

Meaningful 2-way communication fulfills a vital function in an emergency response, as pivotal as providing food, water, or health services.

[Communication with the local populations is critical. This is just one of the many challenges for aid agencies. One approach that would aid communication is to have local figures, especially those with seniority who have authority, work together with the aid agencies, as these individuals are most likely to be trusted by the community. - Mod.LK]

http://origin.who.int/ith/evd-travel-advice-final-15-08-2018-final.pdf

The risk of contracting Ebola virus disease to most travellers is low. Travellers in the affected areas should avoid exposure to Ebola virus and practice good hygiene. If symptoms consistent with Ebola virus disease develop, seek immediate medical attention. Travellers in transit with symptoms should advise flight and other transport crews of symptoms and travel history. Risk of disease is low to returning travelers. ...[more]

- Thu 16 Aug 2018. No handshakes, no helmets in eastern Congo city preparing for Ebola
[Reuters, edited]
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-ebola-congo-goma/no-handshakes-no-helmets-in-eastern-congo-city-preparing-for-ebola-idUSKBN1L123W
[Byline: Fiston Mahamba]

A mobile blood-testing lab, hand-washing stations on street corners, motorcycle taxi drivers forbidden from sharing spare helmets -- if Ebola is coming, the city of Goma in eastern Congo wants to be ready. An outbreak suspected of killing 43 people is spreading across the lush farmlands of eastern Congo, where ethnic and military conflicts threaten to hobble containment efforts.

Goma, a lakeside city of one million people near the Rwandan border, is more than 350 km (220 miles) south from the epicenter of the outbreak in the town of Mangina in North Kivu province, and no cases have been confirmed there [Goma]. But the virus has already spread to neighboring Ituri province, and the number of infected cases is rising daily. Residents in the busy trading hub are taking no chances.

"It's not only me who fears the appearance of Ebola. The whole community here is scared," said shopkeeper Dany Mupenda. "To protect ourselves we stick to the rules of hygiene to avoid being one of the victims of this epidemic."

UNICEF has set up handwashing stations around the city, many of whose streets are built on top of the lava rock left from the eruption of the Mount Nyiragongo volcano in 2002. Health workers check residents' temperatures in public places and at the entrance to the city. The hospital has set up a mobile lab to test suspected cases.

It is the kind of preparation that has become routine in Congo, which has experienced 10 Ebola outbreaks since the virus was discovered on the Ebola River in 1976, altogether killing some 900 people. ...[more]

Patrons of Goma's popular motorcycle taxis must risk speeding helmetless across town. "We are told that it can spread through the sweat of heat, and as our helmets are not worn by one customer only, they allowed customers to ride with no helmet to prevent the spread," said a taximan called Wemba.

[3] War and Ebola
- Thu 16 Aug 2018. War and Ebola: a double nightmare in eastern DR Congo
[Capital News and Medical Express, edited]
https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/2018/08/war-and-ebola-a-double-nightmare-in-eastern-dr-congo/
and https://medicalxpress.com/news/2018-08-war-ebola-nightmare-eastern-dr.html
[Byline: Agence France Presse and Albert Kambale]

First came the war, which developed into a brutal, bloody tussle between militias who abused civilians or killed them. Now Ebola, a name almost as dreaded as death itself, has come.

In the Beni region, in the Democratic Republic of Congo's (DRC) eastern province of Kivu, the twin peril has bred fear and despair. The region is haunted in particular by the Allied Defence Forces (ADF), a Ugandan Islamist rebel group blamed for hundreds of civilian deaths over the past 4 years.

On 1 Aug [2018], Beni declared an outbreak of Ebola epicentered in Mangina -- a small town that had been a relative haven from the fighting -- where 6 members of the same family died of the disease.

"I fled here from Kokola, where the ADF were committing atrocities," said Pascaline Fitina, a 36-year-old woman, sitting alone, her head in her hands. "I went to my elder sister, but she has died of Ebola and her husband is being quarantined at the treatment centre. I don't what to do."

Pascal Lukula, a 38-year-old farmer with 5 children, said he was stuck in Mangina, unable to get to other members of his family because of the encroaching militia. "We are caught between the hammer and the anvil," he sighed. "The ADF's on one side, and Ebola on the other."

The Congolese health ministry said Wed [15 Aug 2018] the death toll in the east had reached 42, out of 66 probable and confirmed cases. The outbreak -- the country's 10th since the disease was discovered in then-Zaire in 1976 -- was announced just a week after the end of an Ebola flareup in northwestern Equateur province that claimed 33 lives.

...Containers of chlorinated water have been installed in front of all shops and in the markets to provide rudimentary hand protection. "I wear gloves to protect me from the epidemic," said Jonas Mumbere, 26, who drives a motorcycle taxi. "Customers have started to think twice about getting on the motorbike for fear of contamination."

...Health experts have long fretted about the problems of combating Ebola in the DRC, a vast country that is poor and unstable and shares boundaries with 9 countries. On Tuesday [14 Aug 2018], the World Health Organization (WHO) chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also warned that conflict had helped create "a conducive environment for the transmission" of Ebola.

Hanna Leskinen of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said the grassroots work in combating Ebola lies in locating and treating patients and isolating people who have been in contact with them. In North Kivu, "people are moving around all the time, fleeing the latest wave of violence," she said. "It enormously complicates search and followup of infected people."

Another worry is for the safety of health workers -- "the police and army are providing night-and-day security" for them, said North Kivu's governor, Ephrem Kasereka.

[This article provides an insight into the human reality of trying to survive the double threat of war and Ebola. - Rapporteur.MM

While we have been focusing on the number of cases and case fatality rate, it is more important to consider the human face of the outbreak. Not only is the response by the healthcare workers made more difficult by the instability and violence in the region, but also it is a dire situation for the population affected by the outbreak. The trauma of the war is exacerbated by Ebola; our hearts go out to the people living under these dual threats.

[4] Comment on ZMapp
From: Caroline Maxwell, independent contractor (<caroline.maxi@gmail.com>) [edited]

Re: Ebola update (68): Congo DR (NK) WHO, Uganda cases, concerns, challenges 20180815.5966397 from a report by CIDRAP: http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2018/08/drc-ebola-cases-surpass-earlier-outbreak-total-virus-infects-4-more-health

"It is not correct that ZMapp has to be stored at -20 deg C -- it is essential that it is TRANSPORTED at this temperature because it does not withstand agitation in the liquid form. Once it has arrived where it will be used, it can be stored at +4 deg C."

ProMED thanks Caroline for the correction. As she further wrote, "the incorrect information circulating may impede the use of the drug to treat patients, and although it is still an experimental treatment it appeared to show some efficacy in West Africa, and the death toll in DRC in the present epidemic is high."
