The Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality imposed an immediate indoor confinement for Dutch poultry after the detection of avian influenza at a meat ducks farm in Biddinghuizen, province of Flevoland, on [Fri 8 Dec 2017].

The bird flu of the H5 type is probably of a highly pathogenic variant. To prevent the virus from spreading, all birds on the affected farm, around 16 000 meat ducks will be killed by the Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (NVWA).

There are 4 other poultry farms in an area of 3 kilometers [1.86 miles] surrounding the infected farm in Biddinghuizen. These farms are also examined on the presence of avian influenza.

Minister Carola Schouten of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality ordered an immediate transport ban in a zone of 10 kilometers [6.21 miles] around the infected farm for poultry, eggs and other products or animals which originates from commercial poultry farms.

The national indoor confinement applies to all commercial farms that keep poultry intended for the production of meat, eggs or other products and also to farms that breed birds to be released into the wild nature. The measures were taken out of precaution to reduce the chance of the virus spreading.

[According to information published by the diagnosing laboratory at the Wageningen Bioveterinary Research (WBVR), the causative pathogen has been serotyped as HPAI H5N6. Its genotyping has shown that this strain is not related to the zoonotic H5N6 strain circulating in Asia, which is known to have caused human infections there. The H5 is related to the high pathogenic H5N8 virus which was recorded in the Netherlands (including on the same farm; see further) in 2016. The N6 is related to a low-pathogenic virus strain detected earlier in wild birds in Europe. The current H5N6 strain has been established by the reassortment of the 2 mentioned European strains. Follow-up investigations are being applied by WBVR to obtain additional data on the origin and genetic composition of this new reassortant. The said and additional information is available (in Dutch) at

The same duck-fattening farm was infected (by HPAI H5N8) last year [2016], starting 25 Nov 2016; see, as the 1st outbreak in the list, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000023811_20171103_151315.pdf
