Communication from the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs on yellow fever cases in Mali
-----------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health and Social Affairs declares the occurrence of 3 confirmed cases of yellow fever on Tue 3 Dec 2019.

Of the 3 cases, one resides in Sirakoro-Meguetana in the health district of Kati [Bamako region, Mali], the 2nd in Manankoro, [and the 3rd in the village of Keregoura, both in the health district of Bougouni, Sikasso region, Mali].

In accordance with International Health Regulations, the outbreak has been reported to the World Health Organization.

The Ministry of Health and Social Affairs immediately analyzed the situation and took the following necessary measures:
- sending investigative teams to the field to better understand the epidemiological situation in order to quickly halt the spread of the epidemic,
- strengthening epidemiological surveillance,
- strengthening the response capacity of health workers, and
- disseminating awareness messages.

The Ministry of Health and Social Affairs invites people to observe the following measures:
- destroy larval breeding sites (old tires or any other abandoned objects containing water),
- protect against mosquito bites,
- sleep under insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets,
- keep households and housing clean, and
- get vaccinated before any trips abroad.

The Minister of Health and Social Affairs calls for calm and vigilance and reassures the population that appropriate measures are underway to control the situation.

[An outbreak of yellow fever has been recognized in Mali by official sources. The statement from the Ministry of Health specifies the number of cases, the location of the cases detected, the measures taken, the recommendations, and the notification of the outbreak to WHO, as stipulated by International Health Regulations.

Cases of haemorrhagic fevers have recurred in Mali. Last month [November 2019], cases of dengue were diagnosed in Bamako, the capital of Mali.

_Aedes aegypti_, (but also to a lesser extent _Aedes albopictus_) is the vector that transmits these haemorrhagic fevers (dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika).

Health authorities must use all channels of communication to raise awareness and get people to seek consultation in case of fever or muscle aches. Caregivers, especially clinicians, should consider haemorrhagic fevers (dengue or yellow fever) in any case of fever with a negative thick smear (or negative RDT) for malaria, or in any case of presumptive malaria that does not respond to appropriate antimalarial treatment. - Mod.BM, from ProMED-FRA archive no. 20191205.6824988, in French, trans., edited]

[The occurrence of yellow fever (YF) in different locations is a serious concern, and the measures to increase surveillance are prudent. It is curious that no mention is made of vaccination, whether the population of individuals is already vaccinated or whether there are plans to vaccinate in the localities where the cases became infected. Vaccination in those areas is an effective preventive measure especially since, as the report notes, the mosquito vector, _Aedes aegypti_, is abundant enough to transmit dengue viruses. YF can spread rapidly and quickly get out of hand in susceptible populations with abundant mosquito vectors, as it did in Angola in 2016. - Mod.TY
