A report from the Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) stated that the deaths of 22 spotted deer on 16 Jan 2014 at Kanan Pendari Zoo at Bilaspur were not due to anthrax; the report termed it as negative on Saturday [1 Feb 2014]. The official source said that, following the report, specialists from Wild Life of India and IVRI would visit Bilaspur's Nandan Kanan Pendari Zoo on 4 Feb 2014 for further investigation.

"The Forest Department's surveillance teams, which have been on a visit to nearby areas of the zoo within a radius of 10 km, didn't find a single sick animal whom they could vaccinate. Hence, it's clear that the virus [sic] was definitely not the reason for the animals' deaths," an official said.

Demanding a high level probe, the opposition Congress said that the Indian Veterinary Research Institute has rejected state wildlife officials' preliminary claim that the animals died due to anthrax infections. In a statement issued here, state Congress spokesman Shailesh Nitin Trivedi said the deaths of 21 spotted deer were the outcome of criminal negligence on the part of zoo officials, who tried to cover up the deaths by propagating that it could be due to anthrax infection.

Trivedi said the Congress in Bilaspur had also raised the question of how the animals died one by one within a short span of time, raising doubts about whether the spotted deer were poisoned. He said there was an urgent need to conduct an inquiry by an independent agency into the circumstances which led to the deaths of the zoo animals.

Opposition leaders in Bilaspur had alleged on 17 Jan 2014 that a local BJP legislator and his friends had "partied" at the zoo the night before 21 spotted deer were found dead. They alleged that the anthrax theory was floated deliberately in order to create a scare so as to divert attention from other circumstances that could have come to light during investigations.

Earlier, principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF) Ram Prakash had told reporters: "The spotted deer died due anthrax infection. An analysis of symptoms confirms that the animals were infected by bacteria called _Bacillus anthracis_. The dead herbivorous animals showed symptoms of anthrax bacteria as blood came out through the mouth and anus. The stomach swelled like a balloon because of infection," he had said.

The mysterious deaths of 21 cheetals in Bilaspur zoo which occurred on the night of 14 Jan 2014 are being connected with the party which some BJP men held inside the zoo premises the same night.

Initially, anthrax was blamed for the deaths. However, wildlife experts and veterinary doctors have ruled out the possibility of the disease. Doctors and experts are not satisfied with the report provided by the state animal husbandry claiming anthrax as the reason behind the deaths of 21 cheetals. The experts say that the disease cannot cause sudden death in such large numbers. Also, the presence of disease was not found inside the zoo premises.

The cheetals were seen healthy at 8 pm that night but were found dead the next morning by the guard.

Local residents reported that the party took place inside the zoo and how BJP man Shankar Mali and his son Neeraj Mali took control over the zoo. The locals alleged that the party organized inside the zoo could not have taken place without the father-son duo's permission. Neeraj Mali himself confirmed that a party took place in the zoo. However, he denied his involvement and presence in the zoo that night.

Meanwhile, the principal chief conservator of forests, Ramprakash has denied that there was a party inside the prohibited area of Bilaspur zoo that night.

The team of doctors along with the zoo doctor and veterinarian filed a report in which they claimed anthrax to be cause of the deaths. No post mortem was conducted on dead cheetals. The burial of cheetals in haste without performing the [necropsies] is what made the wildlife experts suspect the involvement of outsiders.

The veterinary department crosschecked the reports and found that there were no signs of disease in the zoo. The other 33 cheetals in the zoo were found perfectly healthy. In the case of anthrax being spread in the area, the remaining cheetals would have also shown some sign of the disease. It was also found that the cheetals had vertical slits on their bodies, which could have been caused with a sharp object.

A probe into the case is being demanded by Bilaspur Congress leaders, as they suspect a human role behind the deaths of the cheetals.

[We must await the exhumation of the buried carcasses and proper necropsies for formal IVRI confirmation of the comment of apparent stab wounds, but at this point, the lack of microbiological and epidemiologic evidence of anthrax, and in the absence of any other cause of death, it is highly probable that a crime was committed. Personally, if the deer had died of anthrax, I would expect to see more bloating of the 4 carcasses in the picture; abdominal bloating is very characteristic of anthrax carcasses.

The chital, cheetal, or axis deer is a beautiful beast; see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheetal, which only makes this abominable act even more inexcusable, and of national embarrassment, all in all, a poor show.
