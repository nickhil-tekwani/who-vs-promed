Anthrax in livestock and humans is erratically reported by the Congo
DR. The extent of this disease in the country is unclear. Previous
reports have been from the Kivu and Orientale provinces. It is also
seen in wildlife, as there is a report of human infection following
villagers feeding on dead hippopotami. - Mod.MHJ]

[The OIE WAHIS database shows that the Congo DR reported anthrax
every year from 2005 through 2010 except in 2008 (negative report):
