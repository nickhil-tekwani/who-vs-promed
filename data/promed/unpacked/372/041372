According to the Department of Health and Human Services, there are 215 confirmed cases and 33 probable cases [of mumps in Anchorage].

An epidemiologist for the state of Alaska says since 2012, it's seen a 98.7 percent increase in cases. "We are definitely concerned." Dr Amanda Tiffany said [Wed 14 Feb 2018]. "In the 5 years prior to 2017 when our outbreak began, Alaska saw 3 mumps cases, so the fact that we are now reporting 248 cases is concerning."

Most of those cases during those years were travel-related but now, according to Dr Tiffany, the virus is successfully spreading because people have either developed a waning immunity to vaccinations or aren't vaccinated.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the mumps component of the MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] vaccine is about 88 percent effective. This means out of 100 people who are vaccinated, 12 people are still going to get mumps, and while mumps outbreaks aren't new in Alaska, Dr Tiffany believes people are vulnerable. "Historically, when you have really high vaccination coverage, it's not such an issue to have a waning immunity and low vaccine effectiveness." The epidemiologist added, "but we do have people who are not being vaccinated, we are having many outbreaks, and people are being infected."

It's important to note that the CDC says that Mumps outbreaks still happen even in highly vaccinated communities, however, "high vaccination coverage helps to limit the size, duration, and spread of mumps outbreaks."

For now, Dr Amanda Tiffany is helping spread the word to combat a disease that can be avoided. "There are people when I speak with them and tell them about the mumps outbreak, they just look at me with a blank face." Dr Tiffany said. "Oh really mumps, that's a thing?"

The state now recommends a 3rd dose of the MMR vaccine for Anchorage residents who want additional protection against mumps if it has been 5 years since the 2nd dose or if the resident believes they are vulnerable.

[2] Alaska (Juneau)

As of Thu [15 Feb 2018], there has been one confirmed case of the disease in Juneau and 3 possible cases, said Alison Gaines, the nurse manager at the Juneau Public Health Center. The 1st case was diagnosed in January [2018], with the most recent suspected one springing up this past week, she said.

Amanda Tiffany, an epidemiologist at the Alaska Division of Public Health, said this is the 1st confirmed case of mumps in Juneau since 1997.

Mumps is a contagious disease that causes swelling in a person's salivary glands. Other symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, fatigue, and loss of appetite. The disease is almost never fatal and long-term effects are relatively rare. Mumps can cause some hearing loss, Tiffany said, as well as inflammation of the brain, brain membrane, testicles, or ovaries.

The main problem for people who have mumps, Tiffany said, is the pain that comes with the salivary gland swelling.

"I think the perception is that mumps is not such a big deal, like, 'Well, you have it and then it goes away,' but if you speak with anyone who had it, they were miserable," Tiffany said.

Starting in the summer of 2017, though, an outbreak began in Anchorage. There have been 247 [now 248 -- see [1] above] cases statewide (now 215 confirmed and 33 probable) since May of 2017, Tiffany said, with 96 percent of them being in Anchorage. The most recent large outbreak was in 1995, when there were 10 confirmed cases in Kodiak, Tiffany said.

The sole confirmed case in Juneau, Gaines said, was in a person who had recently traveled to Anchorage.

"There's no way to know 100 percent," Gaines said of whether the patient contracted mumps in Anchorage, "but there is a link there."

The common MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccination prevents mumps, and Tiffany said more than 91 percent of Alaskans aged 13-17 are up to date on their MMR vaccination. Tiffany said if people don't know whether they're vaccinated, they should call their health care provider.

This past [Mon 12 Feb 2018], the Department of Public Health sent a notice to the Juneau School District and to licensed daycares in town alerting them to the recent outbreak. Early symptoms are similar to that of a regular cold, but those who believe they have mumps should call their doctor and set up an appointment, Tiffany said. Physicians will likely advise people to isolate themselves for the 5 days after facial swelling starts.

"We're trying hard to track cases and stop the spread," Gaines said, "and the easiest way to do that is to know the cases we have in town."

The Vermont Heath Department has announced an outbreak of mumps at 2 Burlington colleges.

Officials said several students at The University of Vermont [UVM] and St Michael's College have been diagnosed with mumps.

The number of cases remains small.

The Health Department said it conducted 2 vaccination clinics this week [week of 12 Feb 2018] for students. About 450 doses of the MMR vaccine were administered. Vaccination clinics are planned for next week for students who live in 3 UVM dorms.

Parents of children who attend daycare centers on the UVM campus have been notified about the outbreak.

So far, no cases of mumps have been identified there.

"Mumps may be spread through close contact, but some people who get it have very mild or no symptoms. Often, they may not know they have the disease," deputy state epidemiologist Laura Ann Nicolai said. "In a college setting, with shared space of dorms and classrooms, it's possible to be exposed to the virus through encounters with people who don't realize they're infected."

Mumps is a contagious illness caused by a virus that can be spread through close person-to-person contact, such as coughing, sneezing, or sharing drinking glasses. The virus causes fever, swelling of the parotid glands, and can affect other parts of the body. Symptoms typically appear 16-18 days after infection, but can occur up to 25 days later. They include fever, headache, muscle aches, fatigue, loss of appetite, and tenderness under the ears on one or both sides. There is no cure for mumps. Treatment involves bed rest, staying hydrated, and fever reduction.

Most people who are ill with the virus recover completely in a few weeks.

[4] Texas: prison outbreaks

Another possible mumps outbreak shut down visitation over the weekend [17-18 Feb 2018] for some parts of 2 Texas prisons.

A stomach bug affected visiting at 3 other facilities, though Texas Department of Criminal Justice [TDCJ] spokesman Jason Clark said a "relatively small number" of prisoners are affected.

The Beto Unit in Tennessee Colony [Anderson county] and the Segovia Unit in Edinburg [Hidalgo county] are both dealing with the possibility of mumps, while the McConnell [Bee county], Ellis [Walker county], and Terrell [Brazoria county] units are all grappling with gastrointestinal illnesses, Clark said.

A number of mumps cases surfaced in early 2017 in Texas, and the disease made its way into the prison system around April, hitting Willacy County State Jail north of Brownsville and the nearby Lopez State Jail in Edinburg, according to TDCJ.

At one point last year [2017], roughly 10 inmates had confirmed cases, Clark said. But then the illness receded only to re-emerge in November at Willacy. Dozens of inmates went on medical lockdown there and also at Stringfellow Unit in Brazoria county after one symptomatic prisoner was transferred between the 2 units.

"Mumps has been pretty prevalent down in South Texas," Clark said at the time. "And what you see in the community often makes its way into the prison system."

Inmates with confirmed cases are put in isolation cells, while any inmates who may have been exposed are put on medical restriction.

TDCJ offers vaccines for incoming inmates born after 1957, but the recent outbreaks come amid a nationwide uptick.

"This is a vaccine-preventable disease," said Dr Robert Atmar, professor and interim chief of infectious diseases at Baylor College of Medicine, "and the thought is ... that immunity is waning and a lot of the people who've been affected in these outbreaks have been persons who have had a number of years since they've had a mumps vaccine."

[From 1-27 Jan 2018, 25 states in the US reported mumps infections in 130 people to CDC. The case numbers have increased since 27 Jan 2018, as 248 cases have been reported in Alaska -- see [1] above.

Mumps outbreaks can occur any time of year. A major factor contributing to outbreaks is being in a crowded environment, such as attending the same class, playing on the same sports team, or living in a dormitory with a person who has mumps [such as in colleges, prisons]. Also, certain behaviors that result in exchanging saliva, such as kissing or sharing utensils, cups, lip balm, or cigarettes, might increase spread of the virus. In some years, there are more cases of mumps than usual because of outbreaks.

Mumps outbreaks can still occur in highly vaccinated US communities, particularly in close-contact settings. However, high vaccination coverage helps limit the size, duration, and spread of mumps outbreaks. MMR vaccine prevents most, but not all, cases of mumps and complications caused by the disease. 2 doses of the vaccine are 88 percent (range: 66-95 percent) effective at protecting against mumps; 1 dose is 78 percent (range: 49-92 percent) effective. Studies have shown that the MMR vaccine protects against currently circulating mumps strains.

In 2016 and 2017, outbreaks ranged in size from a few to several hundred cases, have mostly affected young adults, and are likely due to a combination of factors. These factors include the known effectiveness of the vaccine, waning immunity following vaccination, and the intensity of exposure to the virus in close-contact settings (such as a college campus) coupled with behaviors that increase the risk of transmission.
