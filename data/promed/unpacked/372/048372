Outbreak in Kasai Attributed to Respiratory Infection, Not Hemorrhagic Fever
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Health authorities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
have determined that an outbreak of acute respiratory infection, and
not haemorrhagic fever as was earlier speculated, is at the root of an
epidemic in the central province of Kasai Occidental.
Following an evaluation mission conducted by a team of
representatives from the DRC Ministry of Health, the World Health
Organisation (WHO), UNICEF, and international medical aid NGO
Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), WHO reported on Thu 13 Dec 2001
that 17 deaths from 205 cases reported in the health zone of Dekese,
centred in the villages of Mbisangandu and Bongondo, appear to have
resulted from an as yet unidentified respiratory infection. Blood
samples taken from patients have been sent to Kinshasa and South
Africa for analysis. The majority of deaths have occurred in children
under 5 years and adults over 60 years. However, WHO reported that
treatment with antibiotics is proving effective.
The WHO Emergency Coordinator for the Great Lakes region, Erik
Schouten, told IRIN on Thursday that the relatively high 8 percent level
of mortality could be attributed to the already weakened condition of
populations resulting from years of conflict in the DRC. He said that
reports of another suspected outbreak of haemorrhagic fever in Watsa,
in northeastern Orientale Province, remained unconfirmed.

[The favourable response to antibiotic treatment suggests that the
unknown respiratory infection in Kasai may not be viral in origin. The
single case report of suspected haemorrhagic fever in Watsa (where
Marburg fever outbreaks occurred in 1999 and 2000) remains
unconfirmed. - Mods.MPP/CP.
