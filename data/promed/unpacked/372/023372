A local pet store is currently under quarantine after cases of sick birds were investigated by the Michigan Department of Agriculture. Casa La Parrot, located at 124 28th Street in Grand Rapids, has been quarantined for 2 positive cases of psittacosis, also known as "parrot fever." The 2-month quarantine will expire on 31 Oct 2016.

Psittacosis is caused by a bacteria-like organism and can cause birds to have inflamed eyes, difficulty breathing, watery droppings and green urine along with intermittent shedding, appetite loss and lethargy. It spreads to other birds through droppings and is zoonotic, which means can also spread to humans. In humans, the infection will cause flu-like symptoms.

Jessica Oegema, manager of Casa La Parrot, said that the quarantine came as a preventative measure so it didn't spread to any new birds. A total of 110 birds have been quarantined since the beginning of September [2016]. "The sign on the door scares off some people, but it's really not that dangerous," said Oegema.

Psittacosis is a reportable illness, meaning that if a bird contracts the illness, it must be reported to the state due to the potential that it can travel to humans.

She and her mother, the owner of Casa La Parrot, took preventative antibiotics but are confident that any visitors in the store will not be affected.

The 2 positive [bird] cases began a 2-month course of treatment on 2 Sep 2016 at the Cascade Hospital for Animals and are both doing well and are no longer contagious.

Dr. Tracey Ritzman, a veterinarian with a certified specialization for birds, has been working with some of the birds to treat them for the illness. "Casa La Parrot is doing everything right in the sense that they are working with the state office," she said. "They're doing a good job making sure that the birds are getting well."

The MDOA allowed some of the birds that were being boarded at the store to be transferred home with their owners, as long as those birds continue to be treated by Dr. Ritzman or another veterinarian.

Casa La Parrot will remain open during the 59-day quarantine, but will not take in any new birds. All trimmings of nails and feathers will take place in a temporary tent outside of the store. Oegema said many customers have been incredibly loyal during the quarantine process.

[Psittacosis is respiratory disease caused by the bacteria _Chlamydia psittaci_, a gram-negative bacterium; the bacterium was previously known as _Chlamydophila psittaci_. This is an intracellular bacterium. In birds, the disease is also called ornithosis, or avian chlamydiosis, or parrot fever.

Infected birds shed the bacteria in their droppings and nasal discharges. Other birds can be infected by inhaling (aerosol) dust from these dried infected droppings or by ingesting the bacteria while eating (oral). The bacteria can also be spread by objects (fomites) that have been in contact with infected droppings or nasal discharges, such as food dishes, perches, toys. Biting insects, mites and lice (vectors) can also spread the disease.

Some birds infected with the bacteria show no signs of disease and are called carriers. These carrier birds can shed the bacteria when they are stressed from illness, nutritional deficiencies, breeding, or overcrowding and infect other birds or people.

Birds that are sick may have loss of appetite, weight loss, ruffled feathers, yellow or greenish diarrhea, difficulty breathing, nasal discharge, weakness or trembling and swelling of the tissues surrounding the eyes. Poultry will also have decreased egg production. Trembling or difficulty walking may be seen in ducks. Birds may be treated with antibiotics.

People can get psittacosis by inhaling (aerosol) dried droppings or secretions from infected birds. Direct contact with sick birds can also spread the disease to humans. Psittacosis is a health hazard for people who work in close contact with birds, such as bird or pigeon fanciers, bird dealers and breeders, poultry workers, pet shop employees, and veterinary clinic employees. Psittacosis can also be spread person to person.

Humans usually become infected after inhaling contaminated dust, feathers or aerosolized secretions and excretions. Direct contact with infected birds, including bites, can also spread the disease. Rare cases of person-to-person transmission have been reported, possibly via aerosol spread during paroxysmal coughing. Dogs can be infected with _C. psittaci_ if they eat bird carcasses or feces. They are probably also infected via inhalation.

Psittacosis (in people) can be acute or insidious in onset. The disease varies from a mild, flu-like illness with fever, chills, headache, myalgia, anorexia, malaise, sore throat and/or photophobia, with or without respiratory symptoms, to severe atypical pneumonia with dyspnea. Some patients have a dry cough, which may become mucopurulent. Gastrointestinal signs, arthralgia, joint swelling and nonspecific rash have also been reported. In uncomplicated infections, the illness usually lasts approximately 7-10 days and may be self-limiting. Death can occur in untreated cases, but it is rare in patients treated with appropriate antibiotics. Some infections are asymptomatic.

There is no vaccine available for birds against psittacosis. The best prevention is keeping your birds in a clean environment with good air flow, providing healthy nutrition and avoiding stress or overcrowding. Make sure any new birds introduced into a home are free of avian diseases. You may want to quarantine new birds for a period of time before introducing them into your flock.

To protect yourself avoid close contact with sick birds. Wear gloves, masks, eye protection and gowns to protect you when working with sick birds or when cleaning bird housing areas or cages. Humans in the highest risk group include bird owners, aviary and pet shop employees, poultry workers, and veterinarians. Outbreaks of psittacosis in poultry processing plants have been reported.

In people diagnosis of psittacosis can be difficult. Serologic tests are often used to confirm a diagnosis, but antibiotic treatment may prevent an antibody response, thus limiting diagnosis by serologic methods. Infected birds are often asymptomatic. Tracebacks of infected birds to distributors and breeders often is not possible because of limited regulation of the pet bird industry.
