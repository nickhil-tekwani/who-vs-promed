The University of Pennsylvania and Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture confirmed a case of equine herpesvirus (EHV-1) on Tue 16 Jan 2018 at New Bolton Center in Kennett Square, PA. Elective equine appointments at New Bolton have been canceled pending further instructions from the regional state veterinarian.

Per the University of Pennsylvania and Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture:
On Tue 16 Jan 2018, a horse recently admitted to the University of Pennsylvania's large animal hospital New Bolton Center in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania for non-neurologic symptoms tested positive for equine herpesvirus (EHV-1) and was ultimately displaying neurological signs compatible with equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM). This horse had a non-traditional presentation for EHM, including a single low-grade fever and several days of normal temperature prior to the development of neurological signs. The horse was euthanized. New Bolton Center has canceled all elective equine appointments pending further instructions from the regional state veterinarian.

New Bolton Center will receive equine or camelid (also susceptible to EHV-1) emergency admissions during this time, and all cows, goats, sheep, or pig patients can be admitted and discharged without restriction. New Bolton Center is working with the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture to contain any possible spread of the infection and to determine the duration of the quarantine. Owners and referring veterinarians of the horses still at New Bolton are being notified, and biosecurity measures have been implemented to protect hospitalized horses.

The Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS) has reported that a horse from a small private farm in Albemarle County has tested positive for equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1).

"On Thu 18 Jan 2018, the state veterinarian's office confirmed a horse that had been exposed to another horse with equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM) tested positive for EHV-1," the agency said in a 19 Jan 2018 post on its Facebook page. "The horse had been a patient at New Bolton Center, University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine, where it was exposed to a horse that was subsequently diagnosed with EHM.

"The Virginia horse had a fever but is not showing any other clinical signs," the VDACS continued. "The farm in Albemarle County is under quarantine, and all exposed horses are being monitored twice daily for fever (temperature over 101.5 F [38.6 C]) and other clinical signs. No horses have been off the farm since this horse returned from New Bolton Center. No other horses have been exposed to this [test positive] horse.

"There is no cause for alarm concerning the general horse population in Virginia," the agency said

Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and EHM (the neurologic form). In many horses, fever is the only sign of EHV-1 infection, which can go undetected.

In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months), but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with the neurologic form usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore- and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

[The New Bolton Center treats difficult and/or critical cases, which means those cases may not get the care they need in a timely fashion. This is a contagious and frequently deadly disease. The center is acting prudently to protect other patients. However, it appears the quarantine of the infected horse was not quite soon enough as apparently the Virginia horse was exposed to the infection while at the New Bolton Center. We wish the best for the Virginia horse. - Mod.TG
