A dog was infected and at least 1 rabbit died recently in Yoder of tularemia -- a bacterial infection known as "rabbit fever" that has spiked in recent years across Colorado.

The dog is being treated with antibiotics. People who were in contact with it will be assessed and monitored in the coming days, though none has tested positive for the disease, according to El Paso County Public Health.

The animal infections mark the 1st confirmed cases in El Paso County in 2015, and they come as the state deals with a spike in cases.

12 people across Colorado have contracted the disease so far in 2015, and 16 people were infected during 2014 -- far above the handful of cases reported annually.

El Paso County health officials urge people to be cautious around dead or sick animals.

A Yoder resident noticed many dead rabbits in the area, and 1 of the dead rabbits tested positive for the virus Monday [29 Jun 2015], the health department said.

No humans in El Paso County have been infected since 2010, the health department said.

Tularemia, which is endemic to the county, is typically transmitted when humans handle sick or dead animals infected with the disease, such as while hunting. It can also be transmitted by infected insects, such as ticks or deer flies.

Symptoms generally mimic the plague, causing fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, chest pain and coughing, the health department said.

[Tularemia is caused by the gram-negative bacterium _Francisella tularensis_.

Tularemia is largely confined to the Northern Hemisphere and is not normally found in the tropics or the Southern Hemisphere.

_Francisella tularensis_ subsp. _tularensis_(Type A) is associated with lagomorphs in North America. It is transmitted primarily by ticks and biting flies, is highly virulent for humans and domestic rabbits.

In addition to vector transmission, tularemia may be spread by contact with infected animals or environmental fomites by inhalation, or by ingestion of the poorly cooked flesh of infected animals or contaminated water.
