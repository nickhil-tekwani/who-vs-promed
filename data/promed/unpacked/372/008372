African Swine Fever (ASF) remains deeply entrenched in Georgia and
has recently also hit northern Armenia and the outskirts of the
capital Yerevan, FAO said today [3 Oct 2007]. It is certain that the
epidemic in Georgia is the source of the outbreaks in Armenia, FAO said.
African Swine Fever was confirmed in Georgia in early June 2007, the
1st time the virus occurred in the Caucasus region. The virus was
probably introduced [at the latest in April 2007. - Mod.AS] by
improperly disposed waste from international ships carrying
contaminated meat or meat products.
The virus has rapidly spread throughout Georgia, with 52 of 65
districts being currently affected. It is likely that more outbreaks
will occur, FAO warned. More than 68 000 pigs have died of the virus
or been culled. Proper surveillance followed by killing infected
animals or animals at risk, movement control of animals, and
biosecurity on farms is essential to get the disease under control.
In Georgia, around 500 000 pigs are kept mainly in backyards. They
are usually allowed to roam freely, which contributes to the spread
of the disease. Pig production is an important source of meat for
rural communities and of income. [Wild boars should be taken into
consideration as well, potentially becoming the reservoir of the ASF
virus. - Mod.AS]
In Armenia, outbreaks are on the rise and it seems likely that the
virus is spreading. "All pig units must be regarded as being at
risk," a recent joint mission of the European Community, FAO, and the
World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) to Armenia warned. Pigs
number between several hundred thousand and over one million and are
mainly kept in small backyard herds.
FAO is planning to provide emergency technical assistance to Georgia
and Armenia in order to accelerate rapid surveillance and to support
the governments in implementing a national control strategy. FAO also
aims to strengthen veterinary services through training and the
provision of equipment. Public awareness campaigns are required to
involve the public in disease control.
"The drastic reduction of veterinarians in Georgia, lack of transport
at all levels, insufficient surveillance and monitoring programmes,
poor biosecurity, and uncontrolled swill feeding are issues that need
to be urgently addressed," said FAO veterinary expert Klaus Depner.
"Georgia is a completely unprotected country regarding the
introduction of highly dangerous viruses. ASF offers a chance to
improve disease surveillance and control capacity and build a line of
defence against future animal diseases," he said.
ASF is a highly contagious virus infection of pigs that is usually
lethal. The disease is not dangerous for humans. ASF is endemic in
domestic and wild pigs in most of sub-Saharan Africa and
Sardinia/Italy. The disease can wipe out entire pig populations and
has serious impact on food security and livelihoods. There are no
vaccines or drugs available to prevent or control the infection.

[Georgia's 4 reports to the OIE on ASF within its boundaries,
submitted between 5 Jun 2007 and 13 Aug 2007, are available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=5720>.
A separate notification addressed the outbreak in Abkhazia (see
ProMED-mail 20070820.2724).
Armenia's immediate, and so far only notification was submitted on 29
Aug 2007 and is available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=6051>.
Follow-up reports from both countries will be helpful. - Mod.AS]
