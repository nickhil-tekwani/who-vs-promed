Nepal: 16 Influenza Virus Infection Deaths in Mugu District
---------------------------------------------------
It was reported on Mon 8 Mar 2004 that 16 people have died of viral
influenza within one week in Mugu district. The disease has hit several
villages of Ruhga VDC, but most of the casualties have been in Ward No.6.
No health facilities are available in the area.
Although the District Public Health Office of Mugu has said a medical team
has been sent to the area, the disease, reports said, is finding more and
more victims, especially children and the elderly.

[An outbreak of suspected avian influenza in Nepal was reported by the
Xinhuanet News Agency on 8 Feb 2004; see:
<http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2004-02/08/content_1303660.htm>).
More than 200 chickens died of an unknown disease in the previous 10 days
in the central district of Bara, causing panic among the local people, who
ascribed the deaths to bird flu that are spreading in some East Asian
countries. The epidemic broke out in Bramhatole Bairiyam of Kalaiya, over
100 km south of Kathmandu. However, the district veterinary office chief
said that -- as neither the diseased nor dead chickens had been brought to
the veterinary office -- it was hard to tell what disease the chickens had
succumbed to.
The age distribution of the cases in the current outbreak of influenza in
the human population, however, would be more consistent with an outbreak
of classical human influenza rather than avian influenza. Further
information from an informed source would be welcomed. - Mods.MPP/CP]
