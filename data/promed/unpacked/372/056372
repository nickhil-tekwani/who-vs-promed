Official sources have reported that 2 heads of cattle have died per day,
following an unidentified outbreak reported about one month ago, at Caholo
Commune, Humpata District, in Southern Huila Province.
According to veterinarians, the deaths might be linked to sicknesses such
as carbuncle and contagious peripneumonia.

[The article is a little difficult to understand. Have 2 animals died, or
have 2 animals died per day, and for how many days? If the deaths are
linked to carbuncle, this is another name for anthrax. Therefore, knowing
more about the nature of the deaths, and how many animals have died, would
be helpful.
Contagious peripneumonia is sometimes used to refer to the disease
contagious pleuropneumonia, or mycoplasma mycoides.
Death can be part of either of these disease complexes. If there is more
information, possibly a necropsy report, or any testing on any of these
animals, ProMED-mail would appreciate an authoritative report. - Mod.TG]
