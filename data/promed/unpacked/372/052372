Imported human case of avian influenza A(H7N9) under CHP investigation
--------------------------------------------------------
The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) is today [9 Apr 2014] investigating an imported human case of avian influenza A(H7N9) affecting a woman aged 82.

The patient, with underlying medical conditions, lives in Liwan, Guangzhou with her family. She has presented with cough with blood-stained sputum since [7 Apr 2014] but had no fever.

She came to Hong Kong with her 2 family members by car via Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Control Point yesterday [8 Apr 2014]. Upon arrival, she was directly transferred to the Accident and Emergency Department of North District Hospital by ambulance and was admitted for further management under isolation on the same day. Her current condition is stable.

Her sputum specimen tested positive for avian influenza A(H7N9) virus upon preliminary laboratory testing by the CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch tonight [9 Apr 2014].

The patient has been transferred to Princess Margaret Hospital for isolation and treatment. Her exposure history to poultry is under investigation.

The CHP's investigations and contact tracing are ongoing. The patient's family members in Hong Kong, relevant healthcare workers, ambulance staff and immigration officer at Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Control Point are being traced for exposure assessment and medical surveillance.

"The Serious Response Level under the Government's Preparedness Plan for Influenza Pandemic remains activated and the CHP's follow-up actions are in full swing," a spokesman for the CHP remarked.

This is the 9th confirmed human case of avian influenza A(H7N9) in Hong Kong. The CHP will notify the World Health Organization (WHO), the National Health and Family Planning Commission as well as health and quarantine authorities of Guangdong and Macau.

Locally, enhanced surveillance of suspected cases in public and private hospitals is under way. The CHP will continue to maintain liaison with WHO, the Mainland and overseas health authorities to monitor the latest developments. Local surveillance activities will be modified upon WHO's recommendations.
