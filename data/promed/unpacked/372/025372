Kyasanur Forest disease which has killed many villagers from Sattari [North Goa district] in the last few years has haunted 35 more patients this year [2018] who tested positive for KFD by Manipal Centre for Virus Research of Manipal University (MCVR) team based at Community Health Centre Valpoi (CHC) [North Goa district]. CHC Valpoi's Health Officer confirmed the 35 positive cases and said this year the cases of KFD are less and no mortality recorded.

This year's most of the positive cases are found in Sanvordem Panchayat [village council; Sattari sub district], which includes the villages like Caranzol, Budruk Carmali, and Khumtal. The health department has intensified its vaccination and have distributed around 900 tick repellent oils in these villages.

It may be recalled that there were many deaths in Palli village of Sattari from February to April 2015. As for a quite long time the reason for deaths was not traceable, the team headed by a well known virologist of India Dr G Arunkumar from Manipal University, was called, who visited the village and diagnosed the epidemic as KFD. Later Dr G Arunkumar opened the virology unit in CHC Valpoi which deals with such infectious disease free of cost.

KFD, commonly known as monkey fever or makad taap in Goa, was first diagnosed in 1957 in Karnataka. The disease is spread by infected ticks.

[According to this report, Goa has had 35 confirmed cases of KFD so far this year (2018), and most of them are from Sanvordem, which is also in Sattari sub district where cases have been reported previously (ProMED-mail posts 20180105.5536623 and 20180111.5551314). Vector control measures and public education regarding personal protection can help towards reducing the transmission of Kyasanur Forest disease. - Mod.UBA
