Senegal reports 2 cases of polio
--------------------------------
The Senegalese Minister of Health and Prevention, Modou Diagne Fada,
announced in Dakar on Thursday [4 Mar 2010] that there were 2 cases
of poliomyelitis reported in his country, affirming that these were
the 1st such cases since 1998.

He announced the organization of a national vaccination campaign from
[6-9 Mar 2010], targetting children aged zero to 5 years.

Caused by the wild poliovirus, poliomyelitis is a very serious and
contagious infectious disease that can produce limb paralysis and can
result in death.

[The date of onset of the most recent case in Senegal is listed as 12
Jan 2010 (see section [2] global case counts below) According to the
polio eradication website, on 4 Mar 2010, there was the announcement
of a planned vaccination campaign in 19 countries across West and
Central Africa, with the objective to vaccinate more than 85 million
children under 5 years old in order to interrupt a polio epidemic
that has been ongoing for more than a year.

The epidemic traces back to spread from polio endemic Nigeria to
polio free countries in 2008. A total of 9 countries have reported
cases of polio within the past 6 months: Burkina Faso, Cameroon,
Chad, Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Senegal and Sierra Leone. In
addition to these 9 countries, Nigeria, Ghana, Benin, Central African
Republic, Gambia, Cape Verde and Guinea Bissau will all launch their
campaigns on 6 Mar 2010. Niger, Togo and Cote d'Ivoire will launch
campaigns at a later date following political transitions or
elections. (see

Headlines
---------
- A total of 16 African countries will immunize more than 70 million
children this weekend in a massive, synchronized cross-border
immunization campaign to stop the ongoing outbreak in West Africa in
its tracks. The 6 countries considered "highest risk" in this block
will hold a further campaign in 2 weeks and will be joined by another
3 countries which had to delay joining this weekend's activity for
political reasons.

Mia Farrow is in Chad this week to draw attention to the upcoming
polio campaign. The President of Chad, the UNICEF Regional Director

- Only one case of wild poliovirus has been reported globally this
week for 2010 -- a wild poliovirus type 3 (WPV3) case in Swat, Pakistan.

continues. In January and February last year [2009], there were 58

Kwara in February [2010] returned negative for wild poliovirus.
- Nigeria's improved performance in immunization rounds continues to
return impressive results: the country often considered the key to
eradication in Africa has recorded one case of wild poliovirus in
2010 to date -- at the same time last year [2009], transmission was
widespread, with 42 cases recorded in 16 states across the country.

[One hopes that this concerted effort in Africa will result in the
interruption of transmission of the wild poliovirus on the continent.
There are still areas of significant internal disruption and civil
unrest that remain somewhat below the radarscope where silent
transmission may be occurring.

According to the polio eradication website, there have been a total
of 33 wild polioviruses isolated (as of 2 Mar) in 2010 coming from 6
countries. Of these, 28 cases (85 percent) come from Pakistan (7),
India (16) and Afghanistan (5) -- suggesting that there have been
significant inroads in Africa. - Mod.MPP]
