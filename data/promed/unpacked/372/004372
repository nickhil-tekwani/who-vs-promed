The following reference from my database may be of use:
Vasavthathilaka VWJK and Senanayake N. Typhus fever from the mountainous
areas of central Sri Lanka. Kandy_Med_J. 4(1):6-9 1995
Country: Sri Lanka
Organism: _Rickettsia typhi_
Disease: murine typhus
ABSTRACT:
Description of 8 patients with a clinical diagnosis of murine typhus. Rash
developed on 5th day of illness. Lab diagnosis by Weil Felix. The authors
advise that murine typhus should be considered in case of an unexplained
fever associated with a maculopapular rash. (16 references)
There does not appear to have been a serological diagnosis in the case
above. However, serological tests have shown that the infection is common
in Burma, (Myanmar), Thailand, Cambodia, Indonesia, and India among other
countries in the region so it is almost certainly likely to be present in
any other country with rodent reservoirs and flea vectors present (as is
the case with Sri Lanka).

Could it be scrub typhus (mite-borne) which has been recorded from the
island; there were major outbreaks during World War II. Serological tests
should be able to confirm this.
