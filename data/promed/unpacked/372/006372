[Information on the vaccination histories of the cases is not available so
it is difficult to draw any conclusions other than the size of the
susceptible population reached the level that would sustain transmission
and lead to an outbreak. The report of 40 cases up through the present is
the largest number of cases reported since 1974 (according to the data
provided above), almost 30 years ago, hence it is not surprising to see
older aged cases (up through age 40) as there hasn't been significant
measles transmission on the islands since then (according to the data
provided above). - Mod.MPP]
