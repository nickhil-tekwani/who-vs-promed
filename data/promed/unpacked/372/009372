An outbreak of hepatitis A with 23 confirmed cases has been traced to a food handler who worked in the kitchen of a private Morris County country club, state officials said on Thu 15 Aug 2019. One infected individual remained "seriously ill" on Thu 15 Aug 2019, according to New Jersey Department of Health spokeswoman Donna Leusner.

Patrons of the Mendham Golf and Tennis Club are anxiously awaiting a Mon 19 Aug 2019 deadline for the incubation period to pass for the infectious liver disease, which in some cases can lead to liver failure. Secondary cases related to the food handler may develop until 19 Aug 2019, which is 50 days from the date the food handler was last infectious," a Mendham Township fact sheet advised.

The employee's diagnosis was reported to Morris County and state officials on 5 Jul 2019. Learning his job involved handling of food, he "was excluded from work, and a review of other food handlers for vaccination and proof of immunity was conducted," Leusner said.

Mendham Township officials followed by sending a letter to club members, recommending anyone who dined at the club between 9 Jun 2019 and 30 Jun 2019 to seek advice from their medical provider. Individuals who have been exposed but have not been vaccinated against hepatitis A may receive a "post-exposure prophylaxis" in the form of an injection of vaccine or immune globulin.

Club management is cooperating with efforts to identify possible infected individuals, township health department officials said. An onsite investigation of the facility's food-service operations on 25 Jul 2019 "revealed compliance with hand hygiene and glove use. No food which may have been handled by the infected food handler was noted."

We have taken a number of actions to safeguard our members, guests, and employees," club general manager Joseph Kelly wrote in a statement.

The club is working closely with the Morris County Office of Health Management and New Jersey State Department of Health and following all recommendations to address the situation and keep members informed, Kelly wrote.

During the 25 Jul 2019 inspection, health department officials also provided the club's staff with further instruction on food handling, employee hygiene, food storage, dating of foods, "and other pertinent regulatory items."

Officials also requested increased cleaning of restroom facilities and possible fomites (such as doorknobs and common surfaces) and scheduled an onsite food handling class, held 6 Aug 2019. That training included interactive activity with food handlers to emphasize the importance of handwashing.

Hepatitis A virus is found in the stool of infected people, according to a New Jersey Department of Health fact sheet. People become infected by swallowing the virus, which can happen when infected people do not wash their hands properly after using the bathroom then touch food that is eaten by someone else. The virus also can be spread when childcare workers change an infected child's diaper and without washing their hands touch another object, such as a toy, that a child places in his or her mouth.

Some people who contract hepatitis A may show no initial symptoms. Others may experience symptoms including fever, fatigue, stomach pain, diarrhea, poor appetite, vomiting, dark yellow urine, and yellow skin or eyes (jaundice).

[It is likely, but unstated, that the food handler index case was un-immunized, and this substantial cluster could have been avoided if routine immunization of food handlers was the rule. Spillover of HAV from the multi state large epidemic involving the homeless and/or substance abusing populations into food handlers seems to be frequent, given the number of reports on Google. - Mod.LL
