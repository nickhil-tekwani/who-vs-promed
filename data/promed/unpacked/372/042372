Subscribers are referred to the following article for a review of
Inclusion Body Disease of Boids, which includes reference to
"stargazing" (p. 514). The clinical signs, lesions, putative
retroviral etiology, and transmission of the disease to Burmese
pythons using cultured kidney cells from an affected Boa are
described, and most of the relevant literature is cited.
S. Schumacher, E.R. Jabobson, B.L. Homer, J.M. Gaskin. 1994.
Inclusion body disease in boid snakes. Journal of Zoo and Wildlife
Medicine 25: 511-524.
Stargazing is a vernacular term describing abnormal orientation of
the animal due to central nervous system disease, and is not used,
to my knowlege, in a technical sense for this specific disease, nor
would the sign be specific for this disease. The accepted term for
this disease in the scientific and veterinary literature is Inclusion
Body Disease of Boids, hence a search under "stargazing" would be
unlikely to be successful.
Central nervous system signs are not inevitable in this disease, in my
limited experience with it. Rather, inappetence, depression and
pneumonia have been more consistent. Schumacher et al. comment on the
fact that neurologic disorders are more consistently seen in Burmese
pythons than boas.
