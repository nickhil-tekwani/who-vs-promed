Flavescence doree of grapevine is spreading
-------------------------------------------
In autumn 2010, the presence of flavescence doree (FD) was discovered
for the 1st time in southern Styria in the region of Glanz.

The necessary immediate measures have already been put in place by
the Styrian state government. A declaration of affected area and
quarantine zones, together with extensive measures for disease
control and prevention of further spread, are currently being
organised for 2011.

In autumn 2009, FD was found for the 1st time in south-eastern Styria
(Tieschen region). The vine leafhopper vector of FD had been present
in that area since 2004, and measures to control it were already in
place since spring 2009, even before FD was reported. In 2010,
further measures were added for areas with or under threat from FD.

Flavescence doree quarantine areas
----------------------------------
In Ticino, flavescence doree of grapevine was 1st recorded in 2004,
while the other parts of the country have remained unaffected (see
ProMED-mail post 20100206.0405). Because the norther side of the Alps
is considered a quarantine protected zone, all plants of genus
_Vitis_ are subject to stricter phytosanitary regulations there.

To reduce the risk of FD spreading to so far unaffected wine growing
regions of Switzerland, particularly in the northern parts of the
country, Swiss plant protection authorities have declared the whole
country a quarantine protected zone, except for Ticino and the
adjacent Misox region in the neighbouring canton of Graubuenden.

Since 2007, quarantine protected zones have been set up in the EU in
France, Italy and the Czech Republic.

[Flavescence doree (FD) is the most important and destructive
phytoplasma disease of grapevines due to its fast rate of spread
within vineyards. The disease was first reported in 1954 in France
and is spreading in southern Europe. FD was thought to have been
introduced from the USA, the home of its vector. It is caused by a
phytoplasma (_Ca._ Phytoplasma vitis) belonging to the 16SrV (elm
yellows) group. The only known natural hosts are _Vitis vinifera_ and
interspecific hybrids, but some wild American _Vitis_ species may be
asymptomatic carriers.

Symptoms usually appear in late spring and may include shortened
internodes, stunting, leaves with downward rolled margins and
drooping shoots. Leaves turn yellow in white grape cultivars and red
in red ones. Leaf necrosis and bark splitting may also develop, the
crop is severely reduced and some vines die, usually in the year
following infection. The survivors continue to harbour the pathogen
but appear symptomless (latent infections) unless they are re-infected.

FD is spread by the vine leafhopper _Scaphoideus titanus_ and through
infected propagation material. Symptomless budwood can carry both
eggs of the vector and the pathogen. Reliable diagnosis in both
symptomatic and asymptomatic host tissue (preferably by molecular
methods) is vital for disease management which may include pathogen
exclusion, certification of clean propagation material and removal of
infected plants (pathogen reservoirs). Insecticides can reduce vector
numbers. The phytoplasma may be eliminated by treating dormant canes
with water at 45 - 50 degrees Celsius (heat therapy).

There are several phytoplasma diseases of grapevine in different
parts of the world collectively referred to as grapevine yellows.
