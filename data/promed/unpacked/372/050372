Concerning the moderator's comments about BCG causing false positives:
we have been told by CDC representatives on several occasions in the
past that a positive TST [tuberculin skin test] after 18 months
post-BCG vaccination is to be considered evidence of LTBI [latent TB
infection] and that chemoprophylaxis should be offered.

[BCG, or bacille Calmette-Guerin, is a vaccine used in many countries
with a high prevalence of TB to prevent childhood tuberculous
meningitis and miliary disease. BCG may cause a reaction to the
tuberculin skin test (TST). The effect of BCG vaccination on TST
reactivity is dependent on strain and dose of BCG used, the method of
vaccine administration, the number of BCG vaccinations administered,
the age, weight, and nutritional status of the individual at the time
of vaccination, genetic factors, and the time since vaccination (1).
However, the BCG effect on the tuberculin skin test declines in both
frequency and size of the reaction over time. Studies have shown that
a TST applied several years after neonatal BCG vaccination usually
produces a reaction of less than 10 mm; TST reactions larger than 10
mm are unlikely to occur in the absence of _Mycobacterium
tuberculosis_ infection (2,3). Certainly neonatal BCG vaccination has
a minimal effect on the TST as an adolescent or adult; in a review of
24 studies involving 240 203 subjects BCG-vaccinated as infants,
overall 20 406 (8.5 percent) had a TST reaction of 10 mm or larger
attributable to BCG, but only 56/5639 (1 percent) were TST-positive
(10 mm or larger) if tested 10 years or more after BCG (4). Indeed,
the US CDC recommends that a history of BCG vaccination be disregarded
when interpreting a TST (5).

Interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs), which use antigens that are
specific for _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_, do not cause cross
reactions with BCG, and therefore do not cause false-positive
reactions in BCG recipients (6). A history of BCG vaccination should
thus be an indication for use of an IGRA when screening for LTBI to
eliminate any confusion over interpretation of TST reactivity that
could complicate decisions about prescribing chemoprophylactic therapy
for LTBI.
