Respiratory Infections in Mountain Gorillas
-------------------------------------------
Poaching is the biggest killer of mountain gorillas, but respiratory diseases
come a close 2nd, accounting for about 1/4 of deaths, according to a major
survey. Around 700 mountain gorillas live in 2 separate populations, one in
Uganda and the other in a region that straddles Rwanda, the Democratic Republic
of the Congo, and Uganda. The animals are classed as critically endangered on
the IUCN's [International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural
Resources] red list, although they are the only great ape species whose numbers
are increasing.
The Mountain Gorilla Veterinary Project, based in Ruhengeri, Rwanda,
investigated 100 gorilla deaths dating back to 1968. The team found that 40
were due to trauma, for which poaching is almost always the cause in adults.
More surprising was the detrimental effect of respiratory diseases, including
influenza A and parainfluenza viruses, which killed 24 of the animals.
In a bid to cut the risk of people passing these diseases on, eco-tourists who
trek to see the gorillas in the wild already have to stay at least 7 metres
away, and keep their visits to no more than an hour.
The populations are closely monitored, and relatively well protected. "But
their overall numbers are small, and their situation is still pretty
precarious," warns team member Chris Wittier at North Carolina State University
in Raleigh

[Primates of all species are susceptible to many human infectious diseases,
particularly respiratory infections, because of the ease of transmission.
Respiratory viruses can be passed in both directions. For example, the pathogen
now known as human respiratory syncytial virus was initially isolated from a
captive animal and was designated chimpanzee coryza virus. Information on the
