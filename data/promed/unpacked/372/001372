The Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Affairs confirmed the highly pathogenic H5N6 strain of avian influenza in chickens at 3 poultry farms in Pyeongtaek and Yangju, Gyeonggi Province, and Asan, South Chungcheong Province [on] Sunday [18 Mar 2018].

Authorities culled more than a million chickens from these farms over the weekend -- 800 000 chickens in Gyeonggi Province and 450 000 in South Chungcheong Province -- within a 3 km [2 mile] radius of where the H5 strain was detected in an effort to stop the avian influenza from spreading.

The ministry also issued a 48 hour transport ban on all domestic poultry starting on Saturday [17 Mar 2018]. Movement of persons or vehicles will be restricted for a week around the confirmed locations of the H5 strain.

The 1st farm to be reported for a suspected case of bird flu on Friday [16 Mar 2018] was the one in Pyeongtaek, 65 km south of Seoul. 30 chickens died there Thursday [15 Mar 2018], followed by 80 more the next day. The highly pathogenic H5 strain was also confirmed at a poultry farm in Yangju, north of Gyeonggi Province. The farm bought egg-laying chicks from the H5N6 virus-confirmed farm in Pyeongtaek.
