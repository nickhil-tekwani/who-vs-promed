Japan will cull another 770 000 birds after authorities detected what is
probably a mild form of avian flu virus at a farm in northern Japan, an
official said Monday [16 Jan 2006]. A virus of the H5 strain was detected
among chickens at Moriya farm in Ibaraki prefecture, about 65 miles (104.6
km) north of Tokyo, the prefecture stated.

6 months have passed since bird flu was confirmed to have infected chickens
at a poultry farm in Ibaraki Prefecture. As avian influenza is found on
more poultry farms in the country, a darker side to the spread of the
disease has surfaced.
The source of the Ibaraki outbreak has not been found, but the use of what
has been called an "underground vaccine" to contain the disease is
suspected to have aided its spread. Police also have been investigating
certain poultry farms that allegedly switched chickens to be examined in
violation of the Domestic Animal Infectious Diseases Control Law. "Although
we have finished testing [poultry farms], many cases of bird flu infection
have still been reported," an official of the Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries Ministry said. "What's going on?"
The 1st case of bird flu was confirmed on a poultry farm in Mitsukaido,
Ibaraki Prefecture, on 26 Jun 2005. The H5N2 strain of the virus found on
the farm was relatively weak and different from a virulent H5N1 strain that
spread through Kyoto Prefecture and other areas in 2004. As the Ibaraki
strain did not kill many chickens, the ministry and the prefectural
government concluded there was little chance of the outbreak spreading. But
infections were later confirmed at poultry farms around the Mitsukaido farm.
In early July 2005 the ministry decided to conduct nationwide tests for the
disease and the Ibaraki prefectural government began inspecting poultry
farms in the prefecture. 31 bird flu cases were confirmed, including one in
Saitama Prefecture. On 12 Sep 2005, the ministry and the Ibaraki
prefectural government announced they had finished their tests.
But a spate of infections was later discovered at poultry farms previously
confirmed safe. As of December 2005, an additional 10 cases had been found.
The cases showed that the basic method of controlling the breakout by
containing the virus through accurate tracking of the areas of infection
had been inadequate.
Sloppy examinations and dubious behavior on the part of poultry farmers are
the main reasons the examinations failed.
Officials of the Ibaraki prefectural government who were in charge of
animal infection control were not present when tests were conducted at 14
poultry farms in Mito, Ogawamachi, Ibarakimachi and Minorimachi in the
prefecture. At these farms, poultry breeders submitted for examination
chickens from other farms that were unlikely to become infected. In some
cases, the prefectural government simply phoned poultry farms and asked
them to bring chickens for testing. "The officials just waited outside the
farms and tests depended on the voluntary participation of poultry
breeders," said one poultry breeder in Ogawamachi.
Reexaminations conducted after misconduct at farms was discovered found
inappropriate inspections at 19 of them. The Ibaraki prefectural government
began reinspections last month [Dec 2005].
"Our inspection excessively depended on a mutual trust with poultry
breeders," said Ibaraki Gov Masaru Hashimoto.
The 40 poultry farms in Ibaraki where bird flu was confirmed were mostly
located in the central or south west part of the prefecture.
The type of virus in each case is almost identical to that of a strain that
originated in Central America. The possibility of a strain of bird flu so
similar to the Central American strain developing independently in Japan is
extremely slim. Therefore, a ministry subcommittee for poultry disease
pointed out in September the possibility that an illegal bird flu vaccine
was used. If a vaccine is chemically processed incompletely, infectious
virus remains in the vaccine and can spread when administered to poultry.
Koichi Otsuki, a professor at Tottori University who specializes in
veterinary microbes and is a member of the subcommittee said, "It's strange
that the virus is infectious more to chicken. Human intervention must be
involved," he added.
Poultry breeders in Ibaraki said they have never heard of the use of an
underground vaccine. In the past, however, a suspicious document concerning
the use of an underground vaccine was revealed.
In July 2004, the Japan Poultry Association was told by a poultry breeder
in Kanagawa prefecture that the breeder received a suspicious fax
advertising a bird flu vaccine that read, "These sales are unofficial and
we will not take any responsibility even if legal problems occur." The fax
advertised a vaccine at 650 dollars to 950 dollars per unit.
The source of the document is still unknown, but the association
distributed a memorandum to member poultry farmers, warning, "The use of
unapproved vaccine is illegal."
The government prohibits the use of unapproved vaccines because their use
makes it difficult to trace infections. "I can understand that people want
to use an unapproved vaccine if there is one," said a poultry breeder.
The Ibaraki prefectural police launched investigations by searching 2
poultry breeders that allegedly switched chickens to be examined in
violation of the Domestic Animal Infectious Diseases Control Law. "If we
can find a clue to an underground vaccine, we'll thoroughly investigate
it," said a senior official of the Ibaraki prefectural police.
There were about 10.14 million chickens at poultry farms in Ibaraki
Prefecture as of February 2004, the largest population of all prefectures.
Of those, about 5.78 million were raised at poultry farms where bird flu
infections have since been confirmed.
As of Thursday [29 Dec 2005], about 2.39 million chickens had been
destroyed, with about 100 000 more slated to be killed. The remaining 3.29
million will be raised in isolated poultry farms. The ministry said the
possibility of those raised on isolated farms becoming infected with bird
flu is low. The ministry is monitoring those flocks.
Those farms are still approved to ship eggs and chickens for human and
animal consumption. However, there are only 4 chicken meat-processing
facilities in the prefecture. One operator of a processing facility is
concerned about business. "If we accept only chickens monitored by the
ministry, other poultry breeders may refuse business with us," the operator
said.
As it is also uncertain if the meat processing operators will buy chickens,
poultry breeders are extra cautious about any harmful rumors.

[The AI situation in Japan is indeed ambiguous. Between 27 Jun and 6 Dec
2005, Japan sent 7 reports to the OIE on the identification of "a
low-pathogenic H5N2 A influenza virus" on about 40 poultry farms,
reportedly lingering in Ibaraki district since April 2005. In the absence
of clinical symptoms, the diagnosis was based upon serology and virology.
The illegal use of a deficient vaccine, which might have included a live
virus, was mentioned earlier as a suspected but not (officially) proven
cause of the event (see item [3] in 20051031.3174).
Recently, 77 poultry workers from the affected farms have been found
sero-positive to the H5N2 virus.
It has been reported that an advisory team nominated by Japan's
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry was expected to deliver its
official report in November 2005. Elucidating information on this unusual
event will be helpful. - Mod.AS]
