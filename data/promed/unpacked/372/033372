This refers to the news posted on ProMED-mail of 25 Mar 2000.
Effectively there have been reports of "unusual" numbers of cases of
encephalitis in districts of the Mid-Western Region of Nepal in the last
2-3 months.
According to data received at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division
of the Department of Health Services (EDCD/DHS), MoH, when comparing the
number of reported cases during the first 11epidemiological weeks of 2000,
against those reported during the same period for the last 2 years
(1998-99), the number of reported cases for 2000 does not exceed the
expected number of cases for the same period during 98-99. Serologic
samples have been collected from some of the cases and are being processed
at the laboratory.
Cases of encephalitis are reported in Nepal throughout the year every year;
epidemics occur during the rainy ("monsoon") season (June-September) with
the total number of cases increasing each year (almost 3000 reported during
1999 which represents so far, the second highest case-incidence of the
disease since 1978). This increase in the number of cases, follows more or
less the same "step ladder" pattern observed during the last 21 years in
which "epidemic peaks" have been observed every 1-5 years.
Cases start to build up in the months of April-May, and reach their peak
during August-September, and start to decline by the end of September and
beginning of October, to level off in the month of November. The same
pattern has been observed in the past where 75% of the total cases of
encephalitis have been concentrated in the period ranging from June to
October, coinciding with the rainy season as mentioned before.
Studies conducted in early 1980's attributed this epidemics to Japanese
encephalitis (first described in Nepal in 1978). After that, it was assumed
that JE was the main [agent responsible for the epidemics.
In 1996-1997, serologic studies were conducted independently by the
Institute of Medicine and the EDCD/DHS; results showed that around 53% of
the cases were due to JE, while some 10% turn to be malaria (_P.
falciparum_) and the rest unknown.
Since 1999, and with the support of the USAID funded EHP-project on
infectious diseases in Nepal, the laboratory capacity of the Vector Borne
Disease, Research and Training Center (VBDRTC) has been upgraded and
samples from suspected encephalitis cases are being tested against JE with
a anti-JE-IgM capture ELISA test. Laboratory tests conducted during 1999
confirmed that endemic JEV is responsible for more than 75% of the cases,
so it can be said that the outbreaks of encephalitis are related to the
hyperendemic transmission of the JEV. Two districts (Bankey and Kailali,
both in the mid/far-western terai regions of Nepal) are reporting more than
72% of the total number of cases and deaths of encephalitis.
Nevertheless, as cases of encephalitis are reported all year long, we still
do not know whether those cases occurring before or after the epidemic
season are related to low transmission of JEV, or if there are any other
viruses involved.
Last year, some samples having a low increase in the anti-JE-IgM titers
between the first and second samples, were tested in the AFRIMS laboratory
in Thailand (personal communication) against other flaviviruses; some of
them resulted in extremely high titers for West Nile virus (WNV), raising
the question whether WNV could be responsible for some of the cases,
although we understand that cross-reactions do occur (it would be the first
description of WNV in Nepal; there are some studies reporting WNV in the
north-western states of India).
When analysing the data from Nepal again, it was noted that the CFR [case
fatality rate for the last few years has remained around 15%, which
according to some specialists is not the usual CFR observed for JE
(25-30%). So the suspicion that other flaviviruses could be involved was
highlighted.
Also sporadic incidence of cases of encephalitis, with some cases positive
to JEV in districts located in hilly areas (Palpa and Kathmandu), which
could represent changes in the pattern of JEV transmission, could also
represent involvement of other viruses.
This year [2000, a collaborative partnership between the EDCD/DHS-MoH,
AFRIMS, the USAID funded EHP-project on Infectious Diseases in Nepal and
WHO among others, intends to collect samples from encephalitis cases and
test them (in addition to JE) against other flaviviruses especially WNV. A
protocol will also be developed to collect some samples to try to isolate
the virus(es) from human specimens.
