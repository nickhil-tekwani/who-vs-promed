[This report describes an extension of the range of West Nile virus in the
USA, and, therefore, it is posted ahead of the regular weekly update. 2
human cases, recorded in Nevada in 2003, are now considered to have been
contracted outside the state. Now, only 3 states -- Alaska, Hawaii, and
Oregon -- have remained entirely free of West Nile virus infection of any
animal species (apart from travel-related human cases) since the appearance
of the virus in North America. - Mod.CP]

Nevada: 1st case of West Nile virus in Nevada
-----------------------------------------------
A dead crow, found in Nevada's capital, Carson City, has tested positive
for West Nile virus, in what officials say is the 1st hard evidence of the
virus in the state. Mike Faisy is senior environmental health specialist
for Carson City. He picked up the dead bird at a woman's house last Thu 15
Jul 2004, and test results confirmed the presence of West Nile virus on Fri
16 Jul 2004.
Dr. Bradford Lee, the state health officer, says no cases of the virus
involving people have been detected yet. He urges preventive measures,
including use of insect repellents, wearing long sleeves and pants, making
sure house screens fit properly, and draining any standing water around
homes. State Veterinarian David Thain says people should advise health
officials if they see any dead or sick birds. He also says horse owners
should vaccinate horses against the virus as soon as possible.
Over the next few weeks, mosquito trapping, and the testing of dead birds,
is expected to increase. But, officials are asking the public not to pick
up any dead birds, instead, call the Department of Agriculture at 688-1180
extension 232. They're only interested in dead crows, ravens, and jay hawks
that have not been dead for more than 24 hours.
United Blood Services is also taking extra precautions to make sure the
virus doesn't infect the blood supply. For more than a year, the blood bank
has tested all locally donated blood for the virus, but officials say the
most common way for the virus to be transmitted is through blood
transfusions and transplanted organs.

Nevada: West Nile virus-positive dead crow is Nevada's 1st case
-----------------------------------------------
Nevada's 1st case of West Nile virus was confirmed, when a dead crow, found
in southeast Carson City, tested positive for the disease. "We're just
asking people to let us know if they see a dead bird so that we can pick it
up for testing," Carson City health director Daren Winkelman said Mon 19
Jul 2004.
An 80-year-old couple on Fieldcrest Drive found the crow, on Thu 15 Jul
2004, and reported it to the city's Department of Environmental Health,
Winkelman said. Washoe District Health Department staff installed 20
mosquito traps in the immediate vicinity of where the crow was found. Only
one mosquito was collected in a 24-hour period, indicating very low vector
prevalence. It tested negative for the virus.
A test swab from the crow was sent to the Nevada Department of Agriculture
in Reno for testing. The test is ineffective if the bird has been dead more
than 24 hours, he said. After the test came back positive on Fri 16 Jul
2004, officials notified other agencies. Field tests were started the next
day, he said.
Dr. David Thain, veterinarian for the Nevada Department of Agriculture,
said horse owners in Nevada should vaccinate their horses against the virus
as soon as possible. In California, there was one case of equine West Nile
Virus reported in 2003. This year [2004], there have been 26 cases
reported, and 11 of those horses have died, he said.
Now, only Oregon and Washington have no reported cases of the virus. [A
West Nile virus-positive raven was reported in Washington in 2002: see;
West Nile virus, bird - USA (Washington) 20021003.5457 100 - Mod.CP]]
2 Nevadans tested positive for the disease in 2003 after contracting it in
other states, Winkelman said.
