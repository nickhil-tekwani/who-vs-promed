WHO Plans Lassa Fever Isolation Unit For Freetown
--------------------------------------------------
DAKAR, Senegal: A Lassa fever isolation unit is to be set up in Sierra
Leone's capital, Freetown, following another death from the disease last
week. The victim, a man from Kenema, arrived in Freetown with fever.
Doctors in the outpatient department of Connaught Hospital diagnosed him
using clinical examination and liver function tests but advised him to
return to Kenema for treatment at Sierra Leone's only Lassa fever treatment
unit. However, he died before he was able to travel. "We are not saying
this patient could have been saved given the speed of his death. But it is
important that we establish a treatment unit in Freetown so that cases like
this can be started on the treatment quickly," said Dr. Abdul Rahman Wurie,
WHO's disease prevention and control adviser. Dr. Wurie said the new
isolation unit would be sited at the health ministry's Waterloo Clinic.
"The ideal would have been Connaught Hospital," he added. "But there is no
space there and Waterloo is 20 miles drive on a good road from Freetown and
has the basic facilities required for the purpose."
Meanwhile, doctors of the health ministry and 6 nurses from Freetown are to
join the Lassa Fever Treatment Centre in Kenema for an intensive hands-on
course on managing the disease. Run by Merlin, a British health NGO
[charity, the [Kenema centre is the only specialist Lassa fever unit in
Africa and its staff members are said to be among those with the greatest
experience of treating the disease in the world. While Merlin has agreed to
sponsor the new staff's training, WHO will support them with transportation
and financially. WHO said it would also provide continued technical
assistance once hey are established at the Waterloo site.
Lassa fever, endemic to certain areas of West Africa, is a highly
infectious rodent-borne disease that is also transmitted from person to
person. Sierra Leone's Lassa Fever Belt covers parts of the eastern
provinces where the _Mastomys_ rat, the rodent that carry the disease, can
be found. Cases of Lassa fever usually peak in March with the dry season's
harvest, which allows the rodents to flourish. The prevalence normally
drops away with the onset of the rainy season. But this year, cases have
not fallen as the Kenema Centre is still treating over 50 patients per
month. The increasingly overcrowded accumulations of displaced people who
have less ability to protect either food supplies or their own exposure to
rats is one explanation for the current peak.
