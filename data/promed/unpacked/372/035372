Ebolavirus outbreak in Democratic Republic of Congo
---------------------------------------------------
On 17 Aug 2012, the Ministry of Health (MoH) of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) notified the World Health Organization (WHO) of an outbreak of Ebola fever in the Isiro and Dungu Health Zones of Province Orientale in Eastern DRC. A total of 10 suspected cases (9 in Isiro and 1 in Dungu) and 6 deaths (5 deaths in Isiro and 1 in Dungu) have been reported.

Laboratory investigations conducted at the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI), Entebbe, Uganda, confirmed Ebola virus (Bundibugyo species). Three samples taken from two patients turned out positive for Ebola virus. A National Task Force convened by the Congolese Ministry of Health, is working with several partners including WHO, MSF, and CDC. A joint MoH, WHO, and MSF emergency response team are in the field to conduct a detailed epidemiological investigation and case management.

WHO is supporting the Ministry of Health in the areas of coordination, surveillance, epidemiology, laboratory, case management, logistics for outbreak, public information, and social mobilization. An additional team of experts from Congo, DRC, and IST/Gabon comprised of an epidemiologist, a logistician, an anthropologist, and social mobilisation officers are being mobilized for possible deployment in the field. Control activities that are being carried include active case finding and contact tracing, enhanced surveillance, case management, public information, and social mobilization and reinforcing infection control practices.

WHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Democratic Republic of Congo.

[Laboratory investigations conducted at the Uganda Virus Research Institute, Entebbe, Uganda, have established the causative agent to be the ebolavirus species Bundibugyo virus (BDBV). Consequently the outbreaks presently occurring in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo are likely to be independent events. The Ugandan outbreak is caused by the ebolavirus species Sudan virus and the DRC outbreak caused by Bundibugyo virus (originally identified in an earlier outbreak occurring in Uganda). Further information is awaited.
