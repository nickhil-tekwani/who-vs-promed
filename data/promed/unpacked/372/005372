Health officials have identified a cluster of Legionnaires' disease cases in Union County, [New Jersey] authorities said Friday [24 May 2019]. There are 22 confirmed cases. [The people became ill between 8 Mar-13 May 2019 (https://patch.com/new-jersey/westfield/5-deaths-union-county-legionnaires-disease-cluster). A "vast majority" of those who fell ill live in Union County (https://www.nj.com/union/2019/05/nj-legionnaires-disease-outbreak-leaves-5-dead-after-22-are-sickened-in-union-county.html.)] The disease is being blamed for 5 deaths, although officials said they were "older adults who had significant medical conditions."

"This is a continuing investigation. The risk to any resident of or recent visitor to Union County is very small," said New Jersey Health Commissioner Dr. Shereef Elnahal. "Out of an abundance of caution, the Department recommends that individuals who live in Union County who become ill with pneumonia-like/respiratory symptoms, such as fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, muscle aches, and headache visit their healthcare provider."

The health department recommends people over the age of 50 -Â­ especially smokers and those with chronic lung disease or weakened immune systems -- "contact their doctor and the follow these additional steps: Consider taking a bath instead of a shower, since a shower could create a water mist. Try to minimize your time in the bathroom while the tub is filling. It is fine to brush your teeth, wash your hands, or wash dishes, but fill the sink slowly to avoid creating mist. It is fine to drink cold water from the tap, but start with cold water when heating water for tea, coffee, or cooking. You cannot get Legionnaires' disease by drinking water.

Legionnaires' can typically be treated with antibiotics.

[Union County, with an estimated population of 558 067 in 2018, is located in the U.S. state of New Jersey across the Arthur Kill to the west of the New York City borough of Staten Island (Richmond County, New York); the county seat of Union County is the city of Elizabeth (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_County,_New_Jersey). Union County can be found on a map at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Union+County,+NJ. The southern portion of Newark Liberty International Airport is located within Union County.

_Legionella_ are gram-negative bacilli that are found in both natural freshwater environments, like lakes and streams, and in manufactured plumbing systems. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 C [77-104 F] support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems.

Eradication of these bacteria from plumbing systems is often difficult. Long-term persistence within these water systems is favored by the intracellular location of _Legionella_ within several species of protozoa, where _Legionella_ replicate and which provide protection from environmental stressors, like biocide and heat treatment of plumbing systems; the formation of biofilms allows adherence of _Legionella_ to the inner surfaces of the plumbing systems (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5835138/).

_Legionella pneumophila_ have also been shown to persist for long periods in biofilms in a viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state after exposure to a biocide or heat treatment (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515819/). Monitoring _L. pneumophila_ in water systems usually done by culture would miss VBNC _Legionella_, which can be revived by the subsequent addition of ameba (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18839249).

Debilitated people who are prone to aspiration may develop legionnaires' disease following aspiration of _Legionella_- contaminated potable water; they may also develop legionnaires' disease by inhaling a fine spray (aerosols) generated by showerheads and sink faucets, misting systems, cooling towers, decorative fountains, and hot tubs/spas from water sources containing _Legionella_. Possible person-to-person transmission has also been described (Correia AM, Goncalves J, Gomes JP, et al. Probable person-to-person transmission of Legionnaires' disease. N Engl J Med. 2016; 374(5): 497-8. doi: 10.1056/NEJMc1505356. http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356).

During the epidemiological and environmental investigation for the source of _Legionella_ organisms, patients at risk of legionellosis should avoid aerosol generating equipment and should consume only sterile water.

We are told that most of the patients in the Union County outbreak live within Union County, although we are not told whether they live or work in a defined area within this county where they could have been exposed to the same aerosol-generating equipment. Genotyping the clinical isolates from the cases of legionnaires' disease in Union County will help to establish whether this is a common source outbreak, if the genotypes match. Matching the genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_ will identify the environmental source for the individual cases. However, if the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping. - Mod.ML
