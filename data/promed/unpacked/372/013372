The European Commission on Wednesday recommended a worldwide ban on exports
of Portuguese beef and live cattle in response to a rise in the number of
cases of mad cow disease. The European Union executive sought to bar
exports of live cattle for 18 months, while banning meat exports for up to
nine months. The main elements are ... an embargo on the export of live
animals and a limited export ban on meat and other products. These measures
were part of a package required to stop the BSE crisis. The number of
notified new cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in Portugal is
close to 70 so far this year and likely to rise to 100 by December.
Apparently it was the alarming increase in the incidence of BSE that forced
the Commission to act. Portugal is not a major beef exporter. It sold just
3,000 tonnes in 1997, most of it to Spain which has already closed its
border under unilateral health measures allowed by EU law.
But the move is another blow to Europe's beef industry, still reeling from
Britain's mad cow scare, which resulted in the EU banning its worldwide
exports in March 1996.
The Commission's recommendation will be put to a committee of EU vets on
Friday which, officials said, was expected to endorse the plan. The
measures will not enter into force until a majority of the 15-nation EU's
farm ministers vote for the package. They are next due to meet on November
23-24.
Portugal was quick to denounce the ban.
"It is a measure that warrants the profound disagreement of the Portuguese
government and which I consider wrong, exaggerated and out of proportion,"
Farm Minister Luis Capoula Santos told reporters in Lisbon. Capoula Santos
had warned earlier this week that Portugal would lodge a vigorous appeal
against any embargo.
The article went on to say that Lisbon recently presented the Commission
with a new plan to eradicate the disease and has stressed it is not a
high-risk country in terms of the incidence of the disease, compared with
Britain, which is still fighting to lift an EU ban on its beef exports.
Portugal has so far reported some 160 cases of BSE in cattle against about
175,000 cases in Britain.
Capoula Santos said the cases now emerging in Portugal were those of cows
infected five or six years ago before Portugal had any eradication
programme.
Other measures in the Commission package included a total ban on the use of
meat and bone meal in animal feed and the removal of so-called specified
risk material such as spinal cord from abattoirs. Fischler pressed for the
embargo after EU inspections in May and September revealed serious failings
in Portugal's controls over animal feed. The Commission said it would help
Portugal foot the bill for implementing the measures. "We have agreed a
proposal to take into account some of the economic implications. As soon as
investment is undertaken (to fight the spread of BSE) we will consider
helping them," said Fischler.
