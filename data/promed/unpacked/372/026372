Farmers' reluctance stymies efforts to re-grow coconuts
--------------------------------
The Coconut Industry Board, which is staging the annual general
meeting of the Growers Association on Saturday [19 May 2007], has
indicated that it is experiencing problems with its planting programmes.
It says the programmes introduced as part of efforts to maintain the
number of trees which existed immediately before the latest outbreak
of yellow leafing in 1997 have seen little success. According to the
Board, it did not achieve its targeted planting of 100 000 seedlings
per year, and this has been the experience every year since the
establishment of the programmes.
It says the continued failure is linked to farmers' reluctance to
plant the Malayan Dwarf and Maypan hybrid, which are still dying from
lethal yellowing disease.
Planting under the old programme should have ended in 2004, but the
board decided that the period should be extended. This, as the
targeted 300,000 seedlings over the 5 years had not been achieved.
Under the programme, the board is continuing to offer 60 000
seedlings per year and fertilizer for 80 percent of the seedlings."

Coconut industry pushing to revive tree population
-------------------------------------
The coconut industry is still working feverishly to bring back its
tree population to pre-1997 numbers since the outbreak of the lethal
yellowing disease.
On the weekend [19-20 May 2007], the Coconut Industry Board, chaired
by Dr. Richard Jones, announced that the industry has still been
unable to bring the tree population back to capacity under the
replanting programme which should have seen a minimum of 100 000
seedlings replanted each year over a 5-year period. The Planning
Institute of Jamaica reported in its annual Economic and Social
Survey that, as at the end of 2006, only 54 138 seedlings were planted.
Failed minimum standards
-------------------
The industry has failed to meet the minimum standard each year, the
board announced, due to farmers' reluctance to plant the Malayan
Dwarf and Maypan hybrid seedlings, which are the hybrids still dying
from the lethal yellowing disease. The board said that a shortage of
Maypan hybrid seedlings, drought, and a lack of younger farmers
entering the industry were also cause for the industry's inability to
meet the standard.
The programme should have ended in 2004 but will be extended until
year-end [2007] for the industry to meet the target of 300 000
seedlings. Under the extended programme, the board will continue to
offer 60 000 seedlings per year and fertiliser for 80 percent of the
seedlings free of cost to qualified farmers. A weed control grant is
also to be made available.
The programme will cover the parishes of St. Thomas, Portland, St.
Mary, St. Ann and St. Catherine. To qualify, farmers must be
registered with the Coconut Industry Board and must have land to
accommodate at least 125 coconut seedlings.

[Lethal yellowing (LY) was first reported from the Caribbean region
and by 1981 it had killed 90 percent of the Jamaica Tall variety of
coconut palms in Jamaica. It is caused by a phytoplasma, a bacterial
intra-cellular plant parasite (see recent post 20070514.1536). The
plant-hopper _Myndus crudus_ is suspected to be the vector,
seed-transmission cannot be excluded. LY affects many palm species
and has been spreading in the Americas and parts of Africa. In Asia,
there are a number of coconut diseases suspected to be caused by
related pathogens, including Kerala Wilt in India, and Natuna Wilt
and Kalimantan Wilt in Indonesia.
Symptoms can be suppressed by tetracycline which needs to be injected
into the trunk at regular intervals and before yellowing appears.
This treatment involves considerable costs and is therefore not
suitable for commercial application, but it is being used to save
individual palms of significance, for example in Florida.
Commercial control of LY is being achieved by replanting with
resistant varieties. The Malayan Dwarf varieties are highly resistant
to LY and were also used to create a number of resistant hybrids, for
example the Maypan hybrid resulting from a cross with the Panama Tall
variety. Other cultivars used for resistance breeding include the Sri
Lankan Green Dwarf and the Vanuatu Tall variety. The level of
resistance of a specific cultivar or hybrid may vary according to the
region where it is grown. Unfortunately, some cases of breakdown of
resistance have recently also been reported leading to problems like
the one in Jamaica. Reasons for both these phenomena are unknown and
varietal trials continue in America and Africa.
