Suspected HFMD cases recorded in Mongolia
-----------------------------------------
Mongolian health officials report that 583 cases of suspected hand, foot
and mouth disease (HFMD) have been confirmed throughout the country.
Officials of the General Authority for Emergency Management said Thursday
[15 May 2008] that cases have been reported in Ulaanbaatar and throughout
10 provinces.

An ongoing HFMD epidemic in China has resulted in the deaths of 42
children. In all, nearly 25 000 cases have been confirmed in China.
Mongolia's 1st case of HFMD was diagnosed in Ulaanbaatar on 6 May 2008.
Following that, deputy prime minister Miegombyn Enkhbold was assigned to
head an emergency committee to stop the spread of the disease.

HFMD usually starts with a slight fever followed by blisters and ulcers in
the mouth and rashes on the hands and feet. It can be caused by a number of
intestinal viruses, with enterovirus 71 (EV-71) and Coxsackievirus A16
being the most common.
