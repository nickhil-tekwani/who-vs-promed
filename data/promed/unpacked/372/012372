The Roanoke Valley's health district announced Friday [29 Oct 2021], that a 2nd adult died from hepatitis A complications in an outbreak linked to Famous Anthony's restaurant. The person was hospitalized with complications from the virus, which causes inflammation of the liver. Roanoke City and Alleghany Health Districts officials said it would not release further information about the individual due to privacy reasons.

Officials have identified 49 confirmed cases, including 31 hospitalizations. A small number of cases are still under investigation, but no new cases have been reported to the health district this week. The incubation period, which accounts for the time between exposure to the virus and the onset of symptoms, passed 2 weeks ago.

"We grieve the loss of this 2nd individual, who was loved by friends and family," health district director Cynthia Morrow said. "It is devastating that we have seen a high rate of severe disease with this outbreak."

A Roanoke County resident aged 75 died from hepatitis A complications 8 Oct 2021. He was the 1st confirmed death associated with the outbreak.

An employee who worked at 3 Famous Anthony's locations -- on Grandin Road, Crystal Spring Avenue and Williamson Road -- was diagnosed with the virus. Anyone who visited any of the 3 locations between 10 Aug 2021 and 28 Aug 2021 may have been exposed and should monitor for symptoms, but Morrow said anyone who was exposed likely would have experienced symptoms already.

[Since the last post, 2 days ago, the number of cases linked to an infected food handler has not increased but now with 2 deaths and one case of severe enough disease to require a liver transplant. It is not reported whether the new fatality was the person requiring a liver transplant. It is now more than 50 days after the end of the period stated in the post (presumably the last time the food handler worked) so the number of cases is leveling off but secondary household cases could continue to occur and one has already occurred. It is also possible that food contaminated by the food handler could have been refrigerated at the restaurant and served later.

While many cases of acute hepatitis A are mild and can occur without any manifestations ("asymptomatic") or with nausea and vomiting and abdominal pain without jaundice ("anicteric"), hospitalizations are required in severe liver disease which can manifest with bleeding (the liver produces many of the clotting factors) and mental status problems. More often, short hospitalizations can be required related to dehydration from vomiting and the inability to keep liquids down.

So far 2 deaths in 50 cases (CFR 4.0%). If a serosurvey were to be done of the diners during that period, asymptomatic cases would likely be found.

It is also likely, but unstated, that the food handler index case here was unimmunized, and this substantial cluster could have been avoided if routine immunization of food handlers were the rule. An outbreak of hepatitis A with 23 confirmed cases was traced to a food handler who worked in the kitchen of a private Morris County, NJ, country club in 2019. Outbreaks such as these may not change the statistics for cost effectiveness nationwide but might push public health authorities to a plan to immunize food handlers against HAV. Although now part of childhood immunization programs in the USA and none of the cases were in children, many adults in the developed world are susceptible. - Mod.LL
