Continued disease spread for mango farmers
------------------------------------------
Mango farmers have complained about the bacterial black spot (BBS) disease attack on their crops, and called for urgent action to stop the spread. The disease reportedly is ravaging mango farms, killing the trees and destroying yet-to-mature fruits.

The disease is said to be spreading in Brong-Ahafo and Eastern Regions. About 80 per cent of mango plantation in Kintampo [area of Brong-Ahafo] had come under attack.

The 2011 National Best Mango Farmer said the disease was so devastating that there was an urgent need for research scientists to find a solution. He warned that if allowed to persist, it would have dire consequences on the nation's mango production.

[Bacterial black spot (BBS, also called bacterial canker) of mango is caused by _Xanthomonas citri_ (previously _campestris_) pv. _mangiferaeindicae_. It was first described from Africa but is now known to occur also in the Asian-Pacific region and South America. It is an economically important disease with up to 90 per cent yield losses reported. The pathogen can infect leaves, stems, and fruit, with fruit symptoms being the most economically damaging. Symptoms include small, irregular or star shaped, water-soaked lesions on fruit, which soon become raised and may crack open releasing bacterial ooze. Stem lesions appear as blackened cankers, which may crack lengthwise.

Leaves also show small water soaked lesions, which become angular and raised, increase in size and may coalesce to form large necrotic patches. Their appearance is characteristic and can be used to distinguish BBS from fungal anthracnose (_Glomerella_ or _Colletotrichum_ species) which forms flat, rounded lesions. Severe infections cause defoliation and/or premature fruit drop.

The pathogen lives as an epiphyte but occurs in high concentrations in leaf and stem lesions. The bacterium is essentially a wound pathogen, although it can also infect through natural openings. Incidence is increased by micro-wound development and may therefore be severe in windy areas without windbreaks, when insect populations are high, or in trees that lack vigour. BBS can be prevalent in both low and high rainfall tropical and subtropical areas.

The disease is spread by wind-driven rain, splashing water, and mechanical means (including insect and human activities). Disease management is difficult and may include cultural practices, phytosanitary measures, use of clean planting and grafting material, and bacteriocidal sprays. Infected nursery trees have been a major source of BBS in new orchards. Susceptibility to BBS varies between mango cultivars, but no completely resistant varieties are known.
