I'm not sure I completely agree with the moderator's answer to Eleanor
Kellon's post on 20 July 2000 [ProMED-mail reference, cited above.
> BSE is generally transmitted from neurological tissue. However, because
of the method of killing cattle there is the risk of spreading microscopic
particles of neurological tissue through the blood stream, thus infecting
muscle tissue, which is most often consumed by human beings. - Mod.TG
> There have been no cases of the human form of BSE, new variant
Cruezfeld-Jakob's
Disease (nvCJD) being transmitted from milk. There are no cases of scrapie
being transmitted from milk. They were permitted to sell the milk and
cheeses because there is no risk of transmitting the disease through milk
or milk products. - Mod.TG

First, the method used to kill cattle may contribute to distribution of
neurological tissue throughout the bloodstream (and therefore into muscle),
but it is probably not the only route by which prions can get to muscle
tissue. There is ample evidence to suggest TSE prions migrate through the
bloodstream long before an infected animal is killed.The ready detection of
prions in spleen and tonsil of live infected animals is
probably the best example.In fact the localization of prions in such
tissues suggests prions may migrate throughout the lymphoid system.
Second, I don't believe anyone can accurately say there have been no cases
where BSE or scrapie have been transmitted through milk. There may be no
documented cases that prove such routes of transmission, but there is an
awful lot we simply don't yet know about prion diseases.Transmission of
scrapie from ewes to lambs and BSE from cows to calves is pretty difficult
to rule out. In fact there are a lot of cases (human, bovine, ovine) where
the route of transmission is still a mystery.In view of the likely
migration of prions through the lymphoid system, it seems prudent (if not
flat-out reasonable) that we should worry about transmission of scrapie or
BSE through milk.

[Bruce, you bring up an excellent point with regard to lymphoid tissue
containing the BSE prion agent. I neglected to point that out. However, we
can look historically at scrapie and it has not been transmitted through
milk, at least not that we are aware of, even with our advanced technology.
It seems the agent may be passed transplacentally.
Thanks for bringing up a good point. - Mod.TG
