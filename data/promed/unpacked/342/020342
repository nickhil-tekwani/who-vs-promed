An outbreak of avian influenza (AI) has been swiftly brought under
control in the Eastern Cape after it was detected on an ostrich farm
in Teasdale, near Graaf Reinet, in October 2011.

The Eastern Cape Department of Rural Development said the birds on the
farm tested positive for avian influenza on 14 Oct 2011 and were
immediately placed under quarantine, along with other farms within a
radius of 10 km, under the terms of the Animal Disease Control Act.

Birds on the Hardwood Farm, 6 km away, were also tested, but results
from the laboratory showed no clinical evidence of AI. The farm is
still under quarantine.

"The department has further found that 222 ostriches were moved from
Teasdale to Wapadsleegte farm in Graaf Reinet before the outbreak. The
results from that farm were negative, but the state vets will continue
to monitor the farm monthly," spokesperson Ayabulela Ngoqo said in a
statement.

Under instructions from the national department and the Veterinary
Services section, the owner of Teasdale Farm is to cull all of his 628
birds in a bid to control the disease.

Ngoqo said the department was committed to fulfilling its
responsibility of protecting provincial livestock against any disease
of economic importance and those that are a potential threat to human
health.

province since 1 Feb 2011, this will become the 1st outbreak in
Eastern Cape province. For the respective locations of the outbreaks
in Western Cape province, see OIE's map at

S. Africa's included the following comment in its reports to OIE on
the mentioned 37 outbreaks in Eastern Cape province: "Farms tested
positive on serology during routine surveillance, but tested negative
on PCR, and no virus could be found. Diagnosis [was] only confirmed
after several follow-up PCR tests. South Africa only reports outbreaks
on confirmation of PCR tests. Initially, no clinical signs or
mortalities were seen." - Mod.AS]
