A total of 12 persons have been hospitalized with tick-borne
encephalitis in the Sverdlovsky region. The number of cases of tick
bites has increased more than 2000 during the last week [up to 20
Jun 2007] in the Sverdlovsk region.
The press-service of territorial management of Rospotrebnadzor
(Federal Supervision Agency for Customer Protection and Human Welfare)
reported that it has now treated 18 370 persons with tick bites. Of
this number 3550 are children. In comparison to the last week, the
[cumulative] number of affected children was 3180. Currently 261
persons have been hospitalized with suspicion of tick-borne
encephalitis, some 70 more persons than last week. The diagnosis of
tick-borne encephalitis was confirmed in 12 patients.
Such an increase in numbers of tick bites is connected to warm
[weather], favorable for trips in nature in the Sverdlovsk region.
However, the danger of tick bites in parks of the city and children's
camps does not exist, as they are treated with special acarosidal
chemicals.

Almost 5500 inhabitants of Saint Petersburg, including more than 900
children, have suffered from tick bites in the territory of the city
and nearby areas since the beginning of year [2007]. According to the

period of 2006.
In the city 526 persons have suffered from tick bites. Most tick bites
have been recorded in territory of the Kurortny, Primorsky, Pushkinsky
and the Moscowsky districts, and also in the Pavlovsk park [evidently
not treated with acaricide, in contrast to Sverdlovsk -- see previous
section. - Mod.JW].
At present 8 cases of tick-borne encephalitis have been registered
and confirmed in adults (in 2006 there were 19), and also 37 cases of

Tick-borne encephalitis has been confirmed already in 7 inhabitants
of the Vologda region, and 40 persons contracted Lyme disease.
The territorial management of Rospotrebnadzor (Federal Supervision Agency
for Customer Protection and Human Welfare) in the Vologda region reported
that since the beginning of the spring season, 12 403 persons have
sought medical aid in connection with tick bites, including 3746
children. For the past week [as of 19 Jun 2007], 957 persons have
suffered tick bites, fewer in comparison with the previous periods
[this year -- 2007].
But, as noted by experts, "it is early to speak about a reduction in
tick activity." Certainly, it is less than in May [2007] when in a
week it increased from 1500 to 2500 victims. But tick activity
continues.

[Tickborne encephalitis is caused by 2 closely related flaviviruses.
The eastern subtype of tickborne encephalitis virus causes Russian
spring-summer encephalitis and is transmitted by the tick _Ixodes
persulcatus_. The western subtype causes Central European encephalitis
and is transmitted by the tick _Ixodes ricinus_. The eastern subtype
occurs across Russia and northern Asia, whereas the western subtype
occurs in foci from Scandinavia in the north to Greece in the south.
The eastern subtype is associated with more severe disease, and, in
some outbreaks, mortality up to 25 percent has occurred. The majority
of infections are a consequence of tick bites, but, rarely, infection
has occurred by consumption of infected [unpasteurized] cow's or
goat's milk.
Inactivated vaccines are available for protection against both subtypes.
