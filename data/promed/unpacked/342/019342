Eastern Health is reporting an outbreak of syphilis in eastern Newfoundland, with 15 cases confirmed so far [in 2015]. In all of [2014], there were 26 confirmed cases.

Dr. David Allison, medical officer of health for Eastern Health, said the number of cases has steadily increased over the last decade. "That's way above the number of cases of syphilis we would expect to see in this period of time and it really seems to be growing and growing," Dr. Allison told CBC News Tuesday.

Most of the new cases involve males between the ages of 20 and 49 who have had sexual intercourse with men [MSM].

The health authority is going public in order to raise awareness and hopefully prevent further infections. Dr. Allison said it's important that those engaging in sex outside of a monogamous relationship protect themselves by wearing a condom.

Syphilis is a bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) contracted through unprotected anal, vaginal or oral sex. Latex condoms, when used consistently and correctly, are the most effective way to prevent the sexual transmission of syphilis.

Of the 41 cases of syphilis reported since January 2014, Allison said 10 have been co-infected with HIV. Syphilis increases the potential for the spread of HIV infection, Allison explained. "One of the challenges with syphilis is that because it's an ulcer causing infection, at least in the initial stages, it can contribute to the transmission of HIV by making the virus easier to pass along from one person to another," he said.

[ProMED-mail recently reported on the increasing incidence of syphilis in Newfoundland and Labrador, in December 2014 (Syphilis - Canada (06): (NL) incr. incidence, MSM, RFI 20141201.3000711). The news report above indicates that the syphilis outbreak in Newfoundland, which is occurring mainly among men who have sex with men (MSM), is continuing in the 1st quarter of 2015. Outbreaks of syphilis among MSM are occurring worldwide, including other parts of Canada (see prior ProMED-mail posts listed below).

The news report above indicates that this outbreak is occurring in the Eastern Region of the province, which includes the peninsulas of Bonavista, Burin, and Avalon. Presumably the outbreak is concentrated on the Avalon Peninsula where half of the province's population (262 410) lives, especially in the city of St. John's, the province's capital and largest city (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalon_Peninsula).

The report does not characterize the affected population other than saying that new cases of syphilis are primarily occurring in MSM between the ages of 20 and 49 and that almost 25 percent are co-infected with HIV. The report does not say if the number of new cases of HIV infection is actually increasing, other than saying that the increase in syphilis "can contribute to the transmission of HIV" in the province.

However, a rising incidence of syphilis may not necessarily be accompanied by a rising incidence of HIV infection; there may be a discordant trend, with an increasing incidence of syphilis and a falling or stable incidence of HIV infection. In fact, in a prior ProMED-mail post (Syphilis - Canada (02): background 20120211.1038978), Dr. Steve Berger pointed out that the increasing incidence of syphilis in Canada since the year 2000 was accompanied by a continued decline in the incidence of HIV infection.

As an explanation, another recent ProMED-mail post reported that HIV-infected MSM seek out other HIV-positive sex partners to avoid using condoms, which, of course, would allow transmission of syphilis, gonorrhea, and other sexually transmitted diseases among HIV-infected MSM, without causing a rising incidence of HIV infection (ProMED-mail post Syphilis & gonococcal dis. - USA (04): (OR) rising incidence, MSM, HIV coinfect. 20140608.2527642).

Also, we are not told if this outbreak is associated with use of mobile phone dating apps, such as Tinder and Grindr. Grindr is a smartphone app that uses global-positioning technology to find anonymous sex partners within close proximity who are also on Grindr (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grindr).

Further information about the syphilis outbreak in Newfoundland from knowledgeable sources would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.ML
