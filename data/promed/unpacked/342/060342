News agency RIA (<http://www.ria.ua/>) and the correspondent Anatoly Melnik
apologize for the information about typhus in schools of Vinnitsa. The
presence in schoolchildren of pediculosis (lice) had been incorrectly
interpreted as a sign of typhus.

[It is not stated whether the children had head lice or clothing lice. I
would suspect the former, which is not generally considered a vector for
_R. prowazekii_. - Mod.LL]
