Another 2 cases of rabies-infected jackals have been discovered in the northern region [HaZafon] in recent days. Today (Thu 30 Nov 2017), a jackal attacked cars traveling in Moshav Moledet [map at https://goo.gl/maps/ceqCEd4TskQ2]. The jackal was shot and sent for testing. The jackal's behaviour, attacking vehicles, was highly suspicious of the disease; jackals routinely avoid people. [This case, reportedly, tested rabies-positive on Fri 1 Dec 2017, at Israel's national rabies centre, Kimron Vet Institute, Beit-Dagan. A video clip of the event, presenting the jackal's behaviour, is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHkDpwstfA4. - Mod.AS]

Two days ago, another case was discovered at Kibbutz Ramat Hashofet in Ramat Menashe [map at https://goo.gl/maps/PXovr5hYKzk], where a woman was bitten by a jackal; she quickly arrived at a nearby medical center to check for infection. Today [30 Nov 2017] the lab's answers were received, indicating that the jackal was indeed rabies-infected. An inspector of the Megiddo Regional Council, Commissioner Yuval Azulai, who was summoned to the scene, said that the jackal tried to attack him and that he was forced to shoot it. This incident took place while revaccinations of all dogs in the Ramat Hashofet Kibbutz were being performed, following a positive rabies case, which involved an adult domestic dog was diagnosed [reportedly, previously vaccinated but under corticosteroid treatment]. During the same day, rabies was laboratory confirmed in a dead calf from the neighbouring Kibbutz Ein Hashofet. This calf had been bitten earlier by a rabid jackal.

More than 2 months after the start of the abrupt rise in rabies outbreaks in the northern valleys region, it has become known that the dispersion of oral vaccine baits, an activity applied annually on both sides of the Jordan River for the immunization of wild animals, has not started yet within the territory of the Kingdom of Jordan, on the eastern side of the Jordan River. The reasons for this are unclear, but Walla! News has noted that this may be due to the crisis in relations between the 2 countries following the incident at the Amman embassy last July [2017].

In recent years there has been effective cooperation between the authorities in charge of this activity in Israel and Jordan, and in this framework, rabies vaccine baits have been dispersed within a strip stretching along the Jordanian side of the border/river.

The source of the disease is wild animals and stray dogs that enter Israel from neighboring countries. For this reason, cooperation with Jordan is a significant component in the fight against the spread of the disease. This year (2017), this cooperative campaign has become of particular significance, given the spread of the disease in the areas of Beit Shean, Gilboa, and the Harod Valley, located near the Jordanian border.

The Nature and Parks Authority and the Ministry of Agriculture confirmed that the cooperation with Jordan had not yet begun and did not say whether it is to start or not. The Foreign Ministry said the issue was not within their jurisdiction and referred to the Regional Cooperation Ministry. The Ministry of Regional Cooperation has not yet received a response for its enquiry.

The oral vaccination project is the main component in the combat against the spread of rabies and is implemented by the Nature and Parks Authority and the Ministry of Agriculture. This is a vaccine intended for foxes and jackals and is given by dispersing of the baits from the air.

The baits are thrown out of light aircraft and they look like small brown matchboxes with a smell that attracts foxes and jackals. When the animal bites them, it punctures an inside ampule, allowing its liquid vaccine to come in contact with the oral mucous membranes and immunise the animal. The size of the bait is adapted to the size and shape of the carnivore's jaws and provides a high certainty that when eaten, the animal will be immunised.

Every year, hundreds of thousands of oral vaccine baits are dispersed throughout Israel, mainly in the north. Last year [2017], 475 000 baits were distributed; since 2000, some 6.5 million rabies vaccine baits have been distributed in Israel.

In 2015, the Ministry of Agriculture budgeted the project belatedly and at low levels; only 175 000 oral vaccine baits were distributed.

[During 2017, as of 1 Dec, 49 events of rabies, in 42 locations in North-east Israel, have been laboratory confirmed and reported. They included 28 jackals, 10 beef cattle, one dairy cow, 7 dogs, 2 cats, and one sheep.

The absence of even a single case in a fox (in the past, the main reservoir of rabies in Israel) is striking.

A rabies map, updated 29 Nov 2017, is available at http://www.moag.gov.il/vet/Yechidot/Machon/maabada_kalevet/airueim%20kalevet/Documents/mapa_kalevet_29.11.17.jpg (for comparison, see the 2016 map at http://www.moag.gov.il/vet/Yechidot/Machon/maabada_kalevet/airueim%20kalevet/kalevet_2016/PublishingImages/mapa_kalevet_222324_2016.jpg).

Dozens of exposed people have been recently treated by the public health authorities after their exposures or suspected exposures. The last human case of rabies in Israel was reported in 2003.

The explosive rabies event in jackals (_Canis aureus_, a protected animal species in Israel) is attributed by experts to the steadily growing density of their population and, possibly, to the adaptation of the currently circulating field strain to this species. Further epidemiological studies are anticipated with interest.

The 2017 campaign of baits distribution started on 1 Nov, applying a significantly increased number of baits. Experts hope that this campaign will effectively immunise young animals which are regarded the main cause of the current event.

Information on the current rabies situation in Jordan will be appreciated. -Mod.AS
