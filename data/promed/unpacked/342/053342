A 6 year old girl from Margao was diagnosed with rabies infection on Sunday [10 Feb 2013] at the Hospicio Hospital, Margao and is now undergoing treatment in an isolation ward. Confirming the diagnosis, the officiating medical superintendent of the hospital, P D Nasnodkar, said that although he was not aware of all the facts of the case, it appears that the patient had not received anti-rabies vaccine following a dog bite. The incident has caused a sense of alarm among the residents over the steep increase in the rise of the stray dog population in the city.

[The incubation period for rabies is typically 1-3 months but may vary from under one week to over a year. The initial symptoms of rabies virus infection are fever and often pain or an unusual or unexplained tingling, pricking, or burning sensation (paraesthesia) at the site of the wound. Post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) consists of local treatment of the wound initiated as soon as possible after exposure, a course of potent and effective rabies vaccine that meets WHO recommendations, and the administration of rabies immunoglobulin, if indicated. Effective treatment soon after exposure to rabies can prevent the onset of symptoms and death (see: http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs099/en/index.html).

As the unfortunate child in Margao, Goa is already exhibiting signs and symptoms of disease and has not received post exposure prophylaxis, her prospects of survival are poor.
