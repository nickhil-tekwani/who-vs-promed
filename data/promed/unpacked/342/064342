Health officials have confirmed a new case of measles in Fairfax County, and the infected person visited sites in Washington and Fairfax County before the diagnosis. Now, health officials are letting people know where the person visited in case anyone has contracted the disease.

Measles is highly contagious, spread through coughing, sneezing and contact with secretions from the nose, mouth and throat of an infected person. However, people who have been vaccinated are at very low risk of the disease. Symptoms of measles can include fever greater than 101 F [38 C], runny nose, watery red eyes and cough, followed by a blotchy rash that appears on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. Symptoms usually appear within 7 to 21 days after exposure.

If you or a member of your family believes you have been exposed, are not vaccinated, and have symptoms of the disease, contact your health care provider. Please call ahead before going to the doctor's office or the emergency room and tell them that you may have been exposed to measles.

Here are where and when the infected person was and may have exposed others:

------------------------------------------
[For those who do not wish to read the entire description and analysis, the following conclusions derived from the analysis are worthy of attention. "Development of measles in individuals who have received MMR or MMRV vaccine is a possible, although extremely rare, event. Therefore, especially in geographical areas with a low incidence of measles, maintenance of efficient molecular surveillance systems and the improvement of the timeliness of both case reporting and virus genotyping are of paramount importance to ensure correct differentiation between vaccine-related illness and natural measles infection." - Mod.CP]

Post-vaccine measles in a child with concomitant influenza, Sicily
------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary: The occurrence of measles [was found] in an 18 month old patient in Sicily, Italy in March 2015 who received the 1st dose of a measles-containing vaccine 7 days before onset of prodromal symptoms. Measles virus infection was confirmed by PCR and detection of specific immunoglobulin; viral genotyping permitted the confirmation of a vaccine-associated illness. The patient had a concurrent influenza virus infection during a seasonal epidemic outbreak of influenza.

The child received the 1st dose of a measles-containing vaccine 7 days before onset of prodromal symptoms. Measles virus infection was confirmed by PCR and detection of specific immunoglobulin; viral genotyping permitted the confirmation of a vaccine-associated illness. The patient had a concurrent influenza virus infection, during a seasonal epidemic outbreak of influenza.

Case description
----------------
In early March 2015, measles-mumps-rubella-varicella zoster (MMRV) vaccine was administered to an apparently healthy 18 month old child living in Sicily, Italy. Seven days later, the child presented to the family paediatrician with fever (40.1 C [104 F]), catarrhal cough, runny nose and eyelid oedema. Macular rash appeared over the body 2 days later, starting on the trunk and then spreading to the neck and face. By day 13, the rash was fading, but due to the persistence of symptoms, the child was admitted to a children's hospital and reported as a possible case of vaccine-related measles to the Epidemiology Department of the Regional Public Health.

The local health authority carried out an epidemiological investigation: a standard measles notification form was sent to the regional health authorities and immediately forwarded to the Ministry of Health and to the Infectious Diseases Epidemiology Unit of the National Institute of Health. No direct link was identified with other measles cases in the community, and the family had no history of travel outside Sicily. Moreover, contact investigation revealed no household members or pre-school contacts with symptoms consistent with measles. One of the child's parents developed influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms (fever over 38 C [100 F] and cough), which lasted for 3 consecutive days one day after administration of MMRV vaccine to the patient.

Urine and throat swab specimens were collected from the child and submitted to the Regional Reference Laboratory in Palermo for nucleic acid-based testing for measles, mumps, rubella and varicella zoster viruses and genotyping of any detected viruses. Given that this patient with suspected vaccine-associated measles developed symptoms during a seasonal epidemic outbreak of influenza viruses, and taking into account reports of morbilliform rash associated in patients with influenza B who tested negative for measles virus infection, testing was also requested for influenza and other respiratory viruses.

While no viruses could be detected in the urine specimen, measles, influenza A(H3N2) and respiratory syncytial viruses were detected in the throat swab.

On day 17, the patient's symptoms resolved without complications, and the patient was discharged from hospital (Figure: see source URL). Measles virus was detected in throat swabs taken on days 17, 19, 21 and 25, but no influenza or other respiratory viruses were detectable in these specimens.

Measles virus was not detected on day 28 from a throat swab and urine specimen. A blood sample was taken at this time for serological testing for measles, mumps, rubella and varicella zoster viruses.

[Details of the experimental and graphic display of the data have been omitted, and interested readers should consult the full text. - Mod.CP]

The measles virus was determined to be the Schwarz vaccine strain, genotype A, MVs/Palermo.ITA/12.15 [A] (VAC) [3] by sequence analysis of the genome. Serological and nucleic acid-based tests were performed for surveillance of measles and rubella and genotype determination at the Regional Reference Laboratory of Palermo, formerly a member of the national network for influenza surveillance and genotyping (INFLUNET).

Discussion
----------
In Italy, vaccination against measles is included in the national vaccination schedule. Two doses of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine have been recommended in all regions since the early 1990s, sometimes in association with varicella vaccination. The 1st dose is given at 13-15 months old and the 2nd at the age of 5-6 years.

In accordance with the national measles elimination plan, an enhanced surveillance system was introduced in 2007 with the aim of improving timeliness, completeness of case reporting, and case investigation, including laboratory confirmation of diagnosis and viral genotyping.

As the incidence of wild-type measles decreases in countries with high levels of vaccination coverage, vaccine-associated cases could be misreported, suggesting that there is a need to improve the ability to distinguish between vaccine-associated measles and "true" wild-type measles virus infection.

Post-marketing surveillance of vaccines is mandatory in Italy, and adverse reactions observed after the administration of vaccines are reported through the national pharmaco-vigilance network. According to the latest data available, these are mainly represented by fever, skin rash and febrile seizures, while post-vaccination viral shedding is a very uncommon event rarely documented so far.

With an estimated more than 500 million doses administered in over 60 countries since the 1970s, the benefit of measles vaccination in preventing illness, disability and death appear unchallengeable. Moreover, vaccine safety is annually validated by accurate post-marketing surveillance of adverse reactions conducted by the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA). As for other live attenuated vaccines, adverse reactions following MMR or MMRV immunisation rarely present with clinically significant illness: such illness is indistinguishable from wild-type measles. In this context, the reference laboratory for molecular surveillance plays a fundamental role in measles virus characterisation through viral sequencing and genotyping in order to promptly differentiate between wild-type and vaccine-related strains.

In this report, the pharyngeal excretion of the Schwarz measles vaccine virus [is documented] in an apparently healthy child with a febrile rash after measles vaccination and with laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H3N2) coinfection.

On the basis of these data, some points can be noted. Firstly, although unlikely, measles after MMRV vaccination is possible, and this can mimic wild-type infection, leading to potential measles case misclassification. The application of molecular techniques for viral genotyping is helpful to correctly classify a case and to drive the decisions of public health authorities at the local level.

Secondly, this is the 1st report of a measles case with concurrent influenza and respiratory syncytial virus detection: we cannot exclude the possibility that the co-presence of other viral natural infections in a very young child showing a slight hypogammaglobulinaemia [a primary immune deficiency disease] in serum protein electrophoresis may have favoured, or even determined, the occurrence of vaccine-related measles virus in pharyngeal secretions. Notably, virus excretion was demonstrated over a 25-day period after vaccination, which is longer than previously reported. Interference with other coinfecting viruses or a defective host immune response could play a role in this unexpected persistence of measles virus, although this hypothesis will require further investigation.

Thirdly, virus excretion was repeatedly detected in the throat but not in urine sediment. This finding partially contrasts with World Health Organization (WHO) guidance for laboratory diagnosis for measles virus infection, which suggests to test preferentially for the virus in the sediment of urine samples that have been collected within at least 5 days after the onset of rash. In the case presented here, in accordance with WHO guidance, matched urine and throat specimens were collected on the 5th day after the onset of macular rash.
