An inquiry was ordered into the death of more than 500 head of cattle,
including sheep, in the last few days at a village in Tirunelveli district,
about 150 km from here, allegedly due to toxic discharges from a nearby
bottling plant operated for soft drink major [manufacturer] Coca Cola.
Residents of Rajapathi village near the SIPCOT complex at Gangaikondan,
where the plant is being operated by the South India Bottling Plant (SIBP),
an agent for Coca Cola, allege that cattle had died after drinking the
water mixed with the stored waste of the plant, a charge denied by SIBP.
District officials said a team comprising officials of Animal Husbandry
Department and Pollution Control Board had been sent to the village for an
inquiry into the cattle deaths. They said postmortem examination of the
animals revealed the presence of some toxic element. But it was yet to be
confirmed whether the effluents discharged by the plant was the source of
the toxic content. "It requires further testing," they added.
Veterinary doctors said monsoon viral and bluetongue disease could also
have caused the deaths. But the villagers question this, saying in case of
viral attack, it would have spread to nearby villages as well.
Animal Husbandry department officials also agreed that the sheep had died
only in the Gangaikondan area. Former MLA and convenor of the Tamirabarani
River and Groundwater Protection Movement R Krishnan, who visited the
village, said, "We believe that effluents from the plant are the reason for
the death of the animals."
The SIBP had been facing protests since its inception with the local people
apprehending threat to the groundwater resources in their neighbourhood.
Ramesh Babu, a local shepherd, who stated that his sheep suffered from
diarrhoea after they drank the water coming out of the unit, said if it was
viral disease it would have spread to nearby villages as well. "The cattle
deaths are continuing even today in our village," he said adding he also
had lost 40 sheep each costing Rs 1000 [22.37 USD]. The mysterious deaths
had also triggered distress sale in the area with brokers quoting just Rs
50 to Rs 150 a sheep.
Deputy manager (administration) of the plant, S Kannan, however, denied
that effluents from the plant contained any toxic substance. "No effluent
is discharged from the plant as it had been equipped with state-of-the-art
effluent treatment plant and had zero discharge facility," he claimed.
Krishnan, who sought compensation for the farmers who had lost their
cattle, said closure of the unit alone would provide permanent relief.
A fact-finding team of Food First Information and Action Network (FIAN), an
international human rights organisation, which also visited the area, said
more than 400 sheep and goats died in the last 2 days. Farmers were
unanimous that the effluent from the plant was the main reason for the
deaths, the team members led by Esther Mariam of Wolfe of Switzerland,
said. They found as many as 34 villages around Gangaikondan faced severe
drinking water crisis after the factory came up. "You should not give water
in such a large quantity to a private enterprise," they said yesterday.
The team members met district collector G Prakash and urged him to cancel
the plant's licence.
