Pneumonia outbreak widens; FWP will kill 95 sheep in West Riverside herd
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The deadly pneumonia outbreak in West Riverside's bighorn sheep herd has
spread, prompting wildlife officials to increase the number of animals to
be culled.

"It looks like we'll have to kill about 90 to 95 sheep, rather than the 60
to 65 we were hoping to take," Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and
Park (FWP)s spokeswoman Vivica Crowser said on Thursday [21 Jan 2010].
"Some sheep east of the containment zone boundary were exhibiting signs, so
we've had to expand that containment zone farther to the east."

Between 160 and 180 bighorns lived in the mountains on either side of the
Blackfoot River north of Bonner before the outbreak was discovered last
week. FWP wardens had killed 60 sheep as of Wednesday [20 Jan 2010], mostly
in the Woody Mountain area above West Riverside. The sheep had become
regular visitors to yards and streets in the community about 7 miles east
of Missoula.

The disease usually kills 80 to 90 per cent of infected herds, and there is
no known vaccine or cure for wild sheep. Crowser said killing the sheep
close around Woody Mountain could prevent the disease from spreading to
more isolated bands in the Rattlesnake Wilderness and south of Highway 200
across the Blackfoot River. Other bighorn herds can be found around Evaro,
Rock Creek and the Bearmouth area.

Because the sheep are dying of a disease and may have other health
problems, the meat is not being donated to food banks. Crowser said anyone
finding a sick or dead bighorn should leave it alone and call FWP at
542-5500 for assistance.

[The spread of the disease in these very limited flocks is indeed sad; sad
for the animals and sad for the folks trying to control the disease.
