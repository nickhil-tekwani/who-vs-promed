[We are very pleased Prof. Abdelali Benkirane, the coordinator for FAO's
RADISCON Internet discussion group - RadForum, forwarded this message to
ProMED-mail. The first is from Dr. Al Muhana, the Director of Animal
Health, Kuwait. I have edited this message considerably removing general
comments on FMD epidemiology and retained only those comments that focus on
spread of FMD into Kuwait and it's control. The countries involved in the
RADISCON surveillance efforts include: Algeria, Bahrain, Chad, Djibouti,
Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon,
Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Oman, Palestinian Authority,
Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey, UAE, Yemen. -

Dr. Al Muhanna's message received on 14 July 1998:
FMD due to serotype O has been endemic in cattle and probably in the other
ruminant livestock in the State of Kuwait and other countries in the
Arabian Gulf for many years. As the disease is of economic importance in
the dairy, more attention was given to its surveillance in this species in
Sulaibiya, which is the main dairy production area in Kuwait.
>From the above brief description, it can be noted that FMD is endemic and
outbreaks are observed in cattle in Sulaibiya every year. The disease has
not been recognised in small ruminants because of its mild or subclinical
manifestations until RADISCON commenced active disease surveillance.
The occurrence of FMD outbreaks in cattle and sheep at Kebd, Wafra or other
areas outside Sulaibiya are often associated with the movement of
susceptible cattle that would succumb to FMD, or carrier or incubating
cattle [from Sulaibya or other areas with FMD that will spread the disease
to few susceptible that were already on the property. In the former case,
small ruminants could be incriminated.
There is a possibility that susceptible cattle on dairy farms in Sulaibiya
could get outbreaks of FMD following the introduction of incubating,
infected or carrier sheep. However, the likelihood of the spread of FMD by
sheep is comparatively less important than cattle to cattle transmission.
Kuwait annually imports large numbers of sheep and goats for breeding or
for slaughter directly or indirectly from the Middle East and Gulf
countries where FMD is also endemic. Any one of these countries could serve
as a potential source of FMD to ruminant livestock in Kuwait.
Given that FMD due to serotype O is endemic in the region, the spread of
FMD could occur between small ruminants moving from Saudi Arabia to Kuwait
or vice versa. Moreover, for reasons mentioned above, the occurrence of FMD
outbreaks in dairy farms in Sulaibiya could be fully ascribed to small
ruminants.
A meaningful control of FMD in ruminant livestock in the State of Kuwait
could not be conceivable so long as owners are reluctant to remove infected
animals and practice strict zoosanitary measures and additionally,
countries from which Kuwait imports small ruminants remain infected. In
fact, these are of the dilemmas the national animal health authorities in
Kuwait are constantly faced regarding the control of FMD.
The national animal disease surveillance system (NADSS) put in place by
RADISCON is hoped to result in improved surveillance and exchange of
information between these countries on FMD and other trans-boundary
epidemic animal diseases.

On 19 July 1998, A. Shimshony, Director, Veterinary Services and Animal
Health, Israel wrote:
I have read with great interest the message circulated by you to RadForum
list subscribers, including the analysis of Dr. Al Muhanna, Director of
Animal Health Department, Kuwait on the epidemiology of FMD. The data
included are of great value and certainly contributing to future FMD
control activities in the region.
One issue relates to the seasonality of FMD. In Kuwait, as described by Dr.
Al Muhanna, the FMD season commences at the end of October, declining
towards May.
We observe in Israel, where extensive data are available since early 1938,
also a typical seasonality of FMD, in cattle, sheep and goats. However, in
spite of rather similar temperature fluctuations to the ones prevailing in
Kuwait namely, warm and arid summer months and cooler, cloudy and even
rainy winter months (November-March), the FMD season, in "infected years",
commences in Israel in February, reaching the peak in May, declining
towards July. As a matter of fact, for many years, not a single outbreak
has been recorded in November.
In spite of extensive investigations and vast accumulated epidemiological
data, including virological and serological surveys in domestic ruminants
and wildlife (gazelles and wild boars,) no satisfactory explanation for the
described seasonality has been obtained so far.
Hopefully, the RADISCON activity, as well as other regional cooperative
efforts, will be instrumental in shedding light upon the seasonality
phenomenon as well as upon other epidemiological aspects of FMD in the Near
and Middle East.
Note from List owner: Is this seasonal trend also noticeable in other
RADISCON participating countries and what is the rationale behind it?

[We appreciate Radforum sharing this information with us, which has been
posted to provide necessary background information to our members. Those
experienced in the very successful FMD control programme in Latin American
-- South America is expected to be certifiably and patently free of FMD
within a few years -- will be all too acquainted with the chronic situation
reported for Kuwait. Their problems were all too common, until recently,
throughout South America. Thanks to their efficient vaccination programmes,
overseen by PAHO, Argentina, Chile, southern Brazil, Uruguay, and Paraguay
are free of FMD. The rest will follow. - Mod.MHJ
