2004/118 New data on quarantine pests and pests of the EPPO Alert List
By browsing through the CABI Abstracts, the EPPO Secretariat has extracted
the following new data concerning quarantine pests and pests included on
the EPPO Alert List. The situation of the pest concerned is indicated in
bold, using the terms of ISPM no. 8.
New records
[Note: Only those major food crops covered by ProMED-Plant are listed in
this report. - Mod.DH]
Beet necrotic yellow vein benyvirus (EPPO A2 list) occurs in Ukraine
(Nurmukhammedov & Vasileva, 2003). Present, no details.
In Moldova, the 1st outbreaks of _Erwinia amylovora_ (EPPO A2 list) were
recorded in 1996 and 1997. Severe outbreaks were observed throughout the
country and led to destruction of apple and pear orchards. Despite strict
phytosanitary measures, local outbreaks of the disease have been reported
consistently from numerous fruit-growing areas (Nicolaev et al., 2002).
Present, no details.
Iris yellow spot virus (EPPO Alert List) was detected for the 1st time in
Australia, infecting onions and leeks (Coutts et al., 2003). Present, no
details.
_Stenocarpella macrospora_ (EPPO A2 list) occurs in maize crops in Uganda
(Bigirwa et al., 2002). Present, no details.
Tomato yellow leaf curl begomovirus (EPPO A2 list) occurs in Nepal (Malla
et al., 2002). Present, no details.
Detailed records
In Mexico, _Claviceps africana_ (EPPO Alert List) is spreading. It is now
present in Coahuila, Colima, Nayarit, Nuevo Leon, Morelos and Sonora states
(Velasquez-Valle et al., 2001).
Tomato yellow leaf curl begomovirus (TYLCV - EPPO A2 list) occurs in
Kyushu, Japan. The virus found showed 98 percent similarity with TYLCV-Is
(Onuki et al., 2004).
_Xanthomonas vesicatoria_ (EPPO A2 list) is considered as one of the
limiting factors for tomato and capsicum production in Sinaloa, Mexico
(Carrillo-Fasio et al., 2001).
_Xanthomonas vesicatoria_ (EPPO A2 list) occurs in Himachal Pradesh, India
(Shukla et al., 2003).

[3 phytobacteria, 2 fungi and 4 viruses were recorded in this report. 2
diseases appear to be of particular significance: _Claviceps africana_ in
6 Mexican states; and _Xanthomonas vesicatoria_, which is limiting
production of tomato and capsicum in Sinaloa, Mexico. - Mod.DH]
