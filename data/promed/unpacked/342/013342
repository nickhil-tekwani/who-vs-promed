[1] China - National alert
Date: Sat 3 May 2008

The Chinese Health Ministry issued a nationwide alert on Saturday [3
May 2008] in an effort to control the outbreak of a virus which has
killed 23 children in the east of the country and is spreading. A
statement released by the Health Ministry said it was taking urgent
measures to prevent the spread of the infection, known as Enterovirus
71 (EV-71) infection. The intestinal virus is highly contagious and
can cause fever, blisters in the mouth and a rash on the hands and
feet, which children are very easily susceptible to. In extreme
cases, the virus can cause brain, heart and lung damage.

"Local Communist Party and government officials are on high alert.
Health authorities are urgently taking measures to prevent the
disease and treat seriously ill children," the Health Ministry said
in a statement. Officials fear the virus has spread from eastern
provinces to the south and have urged all victims to report all cases
of the virus infection within 24 hours. The most affected city is
Fuyang, where 3736 cases of EV-71 have been reported, reflecting a
rise of 415 cases in the last 24 hours. The Health Ministry said it
expected infections to climb and peak in the summer months of June
and July 2008.

Health officials said there is no vaccine or specific therapy to cure
the disease but suggest taking care of one's hygiene by frequently
washing hands and disinfecting areas. The delay in announcing the
virus has led to accusations of a cover-up by local authorities. The
Chinese Health Ministry responded by rejecting charges that it failed
to handle the situation properly but blamed the delay on medical
teams who had been trying to figure out what the illness was before
making the official announcement.

A suspected [fatal] case of hand foot and mouth disease (HFMD) was
reported in south China's Guangdong Province, the provincial health
department announced early Saturday morning [3 May 2008]. The case
was reported in Gaoming district of Foshan city on Friday, and the
victim was an 18-month-old boy who died at 10 a.m. Friday, after he
got ill on 27 Apr 2008, the Guangdong Provincial Health Department
said in a statement. The case was probably caused by the intestinal
virus known as enterovirus 71 (EV71) according to the instant
[provisional] sample examination from the provincial disease
prevention control center. Further examination is underway. EV71 can
cause HFMD, which usually starts with a slight fever followed by
blisters and ulcers in the mouth and rashes on hands and feet.

Another suspected [fatal] case of the disease by preliminary clinical
diagnosis was reported in Gaoming district on 25 Apr 2008 according
to the health department. The department sent experts to Gaoming on
Friday [2 May 2008] morning to guide the disease control work. The
health bureau of Foshan city has carried out a daily report system of
the disease since Thursday.

The death toll from a mass intestinal virus infection rose to 22 in
Fuyang city in the eastern Anhui Province since early March 2008.
Central China's Hubei Province has seen 340 cases of HFMD this year
[2008], but no deaths have been reported, local health authorities
said Friday [2 May 2008].

HFMD, [can also be caused by] coxsackieviruses infection and is a
common childhood illness that mainly affects children under 10.
Symptoms include fever, sores in the mouth and a rash with blisters.
It often begins with a sore throat. Moderately contagious, the
disease, more common in summer and autumn, can be transmitted through
nose and throat discharges. Infection can lead to high death rates in
serious cases, and no vaccines are available.

[3] Asia - China, Singapore and Viet Nam
Date: Sun 4 May 2008

A common illness that typically causes little more than a fever and
rash has killed 24 children in China, and health officials fear the
worst may be yet to come as outbreaks occur in neighboring countries.
China's Health Ministry issued a nationwide alert over the weekend
after enterovirus 71 (EV-71), which causes hand, foot and mouth
disease (HFMD), infected more than 4500 children in central Anhui
province. The outbreak is centered around Fuyang city, where 22
deaths have occurred. On Sunday [4 May 2008], the official Xinhua
News Agency said the virus had claimed the lives of 2 more children
in southern Guangdong province.

"That's an extraordinarily high case fatality rate, and that's what
caught our attention," said Peter Cordingley, spokesman for the World
Health Organization's regional Western Pacific office. "Otherwise, it
would have passed under the radar." WHO issued a warning last week
predicting that the outbreak will likely continue in China for the
next few months because the virus tends to thrive in hot weather. It
advised disinfection and frequent hand washing to prevent its spread,
along with closing schools and daycare centers in hard-hit areas.

The outbreak in China comes as the country gears up for the Olympic
Games. WHO's Troedsson said the disease should not disrupt the
Beijing games, which start 8 Aug 2008. "I don't see it at all as a
threat to the Olympics or any upcoming events... This is a disease
mainly affecting young children," he said. But experts worry that the
more severe virus is becoming more common. Viet Nam and Singapore
have both recently seen a sharp increase in cases, including ones
linked to EV-71.

Viet Nam
---------
"On average, several children die from the disease each month at the
hospital," said Dr. Nguyen Quang Vinh at Children's Hospital No. 1 in
Viet Nam's southern Ho Chi Minh City. "Those children die not because
they are admitted to the hospital late, but because their disease
develops fast and attacks the brain and heart."

The number of cases reported nationwide this year [2008] in Viet Nam
was not immediately available, but state-run media have reported that
some children's hospitals have seen increases of up to 7 times over
last year [2007].

Singapore
---------
Infections also continue to rise in Singapore, which has reported
more than 9000 cases this year [2008], with EV-71 found in 25 percent
of the samples tested. No deaths have been reported in the wealthy
city-state, but the government has ordered 11 preschools and
child-care centers closed, according to the Health Ministry's website.

[4] China - 6 provinces now affected
Date: Sun 4 May 2008

<http://shanghaiist.com/2008/05/05/hfmd_in_six_provinces.php>


Since hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) 1st hit Fuyang in Anhui
Province, more cases have been reported in at least 5 other
provinces: Zhejiang, Henan, Hubei, Jiangxi and Guangdong.

622 new cases of the intestinal [virus infection] were reported in
Anhui on Saturday [3 May 2008], bringing the total number of cases to
5151. 22 children have died in Fuyang, and all kindergartens have
been ordered shut.

In Foshan city, Guangdong Province, a 3rd child has died from the
disease. Jiangxi Province has 21 recorded cases, but no deaths have
yet been reported. Neither Shanghai nor our neighboring Jiangsu
Province have any reported HFMD cases yet.

Although it is still too early to tell whether the epidemic has
peaked, the World Health Organization does not think it will be a
threat to the Olympics.

Fuyang City in Anhui has been the hardest hit, with the number of
cases climbing to 5151 with 22 fatalities. No fatalities have been
reported from Hubei, but 3 suspected deaths have been reported now
from the southern province of Guangdong. The reason for the high case
fatality rate in Fuyang city has not yet been determined.
