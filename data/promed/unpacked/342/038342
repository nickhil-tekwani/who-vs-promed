If the figures in the daily health report of AMC's [Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation] health department are anything to go by, the number of malaria cases has tripled in just one year. The city, in January-May 2011, had reported 946 cases on the vector-borne disease, which has increased to 3047 in the same period this year [2012].

Interestingly, a recent survey conducted by the health department indicates that Ahmedabad has lower density of mosquitoes from last year, but malaria is prevalent! The larvae index survey was conducted to identify areas with high mosquito breeding and hence tackle the problem of rising cases of malaria. Ranip and Kali have the highest larvae index followed by Girdharnagar, Naroda Road, and Chandlodia.

"Larvae indices of Ranip and Kali are as high as 1.8. For every 1000 houses, there are 18 with mosquito larvae breeding in them," said an official with the health department, requesting anonymity.

Vejalpur, which was most prone to mosquito breeding till last year [2011], has emerged as the area with the lowest density this year. The average larvae index of Ahmedabad stands at 0.9 with Vejalpur recording the lowest density at 0.2. This means that only 2 houses out of 1000 in Vejalpur have mosquito larvae.

Girdharnagar and Naroda road recorded larvae indices of 1.6 and 1.3 respectively. Mosquito larvae breed in stagnant water, said the official. "Many of the slums and people of middle income group tend to store water in large containers for weeks, which lead to breeding of mosquitoes. Our team of health officials checked for such sites and treated the stored water with temephos solution to prevent breeding," added the official. Water stagnant for more than 7 days is a favourable breeding ground for mosquito larvae. "If residents want to store water, then the best method is to cover the container with an air-tight lid or tie a cloth on the mouth of the water container to avoid mosquito breeding," said official.

Besides the maximum number of heat stroke patients, there has been a surprise spurt in malaria cases in Jaisalmer district. In the last month alone, the number of patients with _Plasmodium vivax_ malaria has crossed 100 with Pokhran sub-division reporting the maximum number of cases.

The increase in cases of malaria at a time when the [temperature is above 45 deg C (113 deg F)] has been a cause of concern. If medical science is to be believed, malaria cases rise after the rainy season. Mosquitoes do not spread during severe heat conditions.

Though the sudden increase of cases in the midst of a sweltering summer has put the health department in a fix, officials claim that the situation cannot be considered as a serious one because people who had suffered from malaria earlier again develop it.

According to government hospital records, malaria was found in 65-70 people in May [2012]. But private hospitals have also received almost an equal number of cases in the same month. In the beginning of May, there was not a single case of malaria registered, but in the 2nd week, 15 people became victims of the ailment. In the 3rd week, there was sudden spurt in cases and the number went up to 35, but in the 4th week, the incidence came down a little.

Life in the desert district was badly affected due to severe heat that starts at 9 am and continues till late night. Each and every household is suffering from seasonal diseases. People are mostly affected by heat stroke along with vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. Snake and dog bites are also common. Jaisalmer district has been declared a high-risk area for malaria.

Often, malaria proves fatal. The medical department is surprised that malaria cases are coming to light during the peak summer season. If the rising trend of the incidence continues, after rains this would spread like an epidemic in the entire district.

Chief medical and health officer Anand Gopal Purohit said it is true that more malaria patients are coming during the summer season, but there is no reason to panic. He said the situation is under control. The entire department has been alerted so that during rains this does not turn out to be big health concern.
