According to Florida state officials, 9 manatees (an endangered species)
have been found dead off Florida's west coast during a one week period.
Scientists are investigating the cause of death, possibly related to a red
tide outbreak in the Sanibel Island area. Last year, 149 of the animals
died due to toxins released by the red tide algae during a spring bloom.
