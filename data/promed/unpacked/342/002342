Increase in the incidence of a bleeding disorder in young calves due to
bone marrow damage
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract
This paper reports clinical, haematological, virological, serological,
pathological, and toxicological findings in young calves suffering from an
apparently novel disease that is characterized by haemorrhagic diathesis on
the basis of severe bone marrow damage and is almost always fatal. No
evidence for infection with BVDV or BTV or for intoxication with substances
known to damage the bone marrow was found.

[The paper is written by workers from 3 German institutions -- the
ruminants clinic in the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at Munchen
University, the Bavarian Health and Food Safety Administration, and the
Bavarian Animal Health Service. This is a welcome 1st scientific
publication on the syndrome from Germany. The bleeding calves disorder has
-- reportedly -- already affected several other west European countries,
including France, Belgium, Scotland, Wales, England, and the Netherlands.
The French practitioners were updated at an early stage by a short
communication in the weekly Depeche Veterinaire (Number 1021 of 14 to 20
February 2009); see

We are grateful to Prof Jeanne brugère-Picoux, Pathologie medicale du
betail et des animaux de basse-cour, Ecole nationale veterinaire d'Alfort,
for the above URL.

The current German paper includes pictures, tables, and useful collected
data; the following passages thereof, addressing the epidemiology and
discussed possible etiology of the syndrome, have been machine translated
and slightly edited for readers' convenience. Some unavoidable minor
translation inaccuracies -- for which we apologise in advance -- may be
encountered.

Clinical picture and course
---------------------------
As described in the general press and by some colleagues, "the calves bleed
from every orifice". This could not be confirmed by our observations: none
of the 25 calves seen showed nasal bleeding, haematuria, hemorrhages from
the ears and eye sockets. Rapid clinical progress and high lethality were
the main reasons for the serious apprehension among farmers. As observed in
repeated examinations, blood counts recovered in surviving calves, allowing
a possible interpretation that the bone-marrow affection was reversible.

Epidemiology
------------
The question has risen whether the syndrome started in early 2007 or
earlier, its recent wide publication being an outcome of increased
attention or intensified surveillance. Given the striking clinical
manifestation of the phenomenon and its serious course with high fatality
rate, the latter scenario does not seem plausible. In addition, it seems to
be clustered in individual holdings. Hence the authors find it reasonable
to assume that, would the syndrome have occurred earlier, it would have
come to the attention of at least one of the 3 institutes involved.

Possible etiology
-----------------
The length of the differential diagnoses list depends upon the selected
clinical signs taken into consideration. If the bone marrow affection is to
be considered as the main symptom, leading to the bleeding inclination and
to susceptibility of the calves to "accompanying" diseases, then several
possible causes of "haemorrhagic diathesis" should be considered, such as
thrombocytopenia, isolated thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy. However,
bone marrow damage does not exclude a possible peripheral cause for the
blood-cells destruction. If the bone marrow affection was not a main cause,
calves which bled for several an extended course of the disease would be
expected to show increased reticulocytes counts; this was not the case.

Bone marrow damage may be caused by genetic, toxic, physical, or infectious
factors or be idiopathic (the latter include immunopathological processes).

The fact that the disease occurred almost simultaneously in calves of 4
different German dairy and beef breeds, Simmentalers being the predominant
ones, as well as Charolais and their crosses, does not support a genetic
background. Whether a certain genetic predisposition may play any role in
some cases, can currently not be fully evaluated.

The use of furazolidone in the feed of food-producing animals has been
banned by the EU since 1995. In addition, it was shown that, in
experimental poisoning trials (8.5 mg/kg/day), 1st petechiae appeared only
after 6 weeks of administration.

Overdose of chloramphenicol for 10 days leads likewise to aplastic anemia.
Application of chloramphenicol in feed for food-producing animals has been
banned by the EU since 1994; plenty other potent antibacterial drugs are
available. There is therefore no cause to believe that one of the 2
substances suddenly would be illegally distributed/used.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and sulphonamides, in overdosage,
could also cause bone marrow damage. No evidence of such possible
treatments could demonstrated from the drug application documents investigated.

It is also unlikely that idiosyncratic reactions to medicaments would
suddenly appear in more frequently.

DCVC (S-[1,2-dichlorovinyl]-L-cysteine), extracted with trichlorethylene,
appearing in soybean meal, may lead to bone marrow and kidney damage.
Soybean meal is not extracted with trichlorethylene for several years;
investigations on DCVC have been negative.

The toxic principle in bracken, Ptaquilosid, may lead to bone marrow damage
but only after weeks of feeding.

Macrocyclic trichothecenes, a group of mycotoxins, which can damage bone
marrow were not detected in the samples examined.

[The discussion addresses several additional chemical substances as well as
radiation, which could be excluded; for details, subscribers are referred
to the original paper. - Mod.AS]

The fact that the majority of patients mentioned a history of elevated
temperature (fever), which could be indicative of a viral infection, in
particular BVD. However, all 25 calves were found negative for BVD.
Moreover, BVD virus-induced "hemorrhagic syndrome" is known to be related
to the peripheral destruction of thrombocytes, not to damage of progenitor
cells in bone marrow.

Parvovirus can cause panleukopenia and pancytopenia in cats and dogs;
bovine parvovirus is known since the end of the 1950s of the last century,
but so far mainly associated with diarrhea in the weaning phase. No
mentioning of bone-marrow effect by bovine parvovirus could be found in the
literature.

Given the epidemiological data (to be included in a separate paper), if an
infectious agent is to be considered, it would have highly unusual properties.

Immunopathological processes may affect T-cells which subsequently may
attack stem-cells in the bone marrow. This phenomenon may be related to
genetical predisposition. Idiopathic thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP) is also
based on an immunopathologic process; this, however, will lead to the
peripheral destruction of thrombocytes.

Regardless of the (still to be resolved) nature of the noxious factor
triggering the bone-marrow damage, the question is, when does this process
occur? Since the various blood components have different lifespans
(granulocytes under a week, thrombocytes 5 to 10 days, erythrocytes 110 to
150 days) it may be expected that, following a severe damage to the bone
marrow, the 1st to be peripherally affected will be the granulocytes,
followed by the thrombocytes and the erythrocytes. The supply of neutrophil
granulocytes by the bovine bone marrow is lower than in dogs, where the
production starts at the age of 5 days.

All dams of the 25 clinical patients were vaccinated against BVD [bovine
viral diarrhoea]; the possible causal relevance between the vaccination and
the syndrome may not be evaluated at this stage but is subject to, inter
alia, ongoing investigations.

It is hoped that the cause of this very mysterious disease will be soon
cleared up; it is being investigated in several European institutes. More
results of our group will be published soon.

The forthcoming publications, from Bavaria and from other European
veterinary institutes, are awaited with interest. - Mod.AS]
