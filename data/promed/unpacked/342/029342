Emergency report
Text of a fax received on 12 August 1999 from Dr Vasilios Stylas, Head,
Animal Health Directorate, Ministry of Agriculture, Athens:
Report date: 12 August 1999.
1. Background - Date of entry into force
1.1 A Level C alert was declared throughout Greece on 8 July 1999, as soon
as the emergence of bluetongue in Bulgaria was officially notified.
1.2 A Level B-1 alert was declared in the Prefectures of Evros and Rodopi
on 28 July 1999, as soon as the spread of the disease to the Bulgarian
Provinces of Yambol and Haskovo, and possibly into KardjaIi, was notified.
2. Description of surveillance measures taken in the first instance
2.1 A Level C alert is declared when a List A disease is known to be
present in a neighbouring country, but its spread into Greek territory is
not considered probable or imminent.
Depending on the disease, standard precautionary measures include, in
particular:
a) Import controls and suspension of import permits
b) Awareness of field Services
c) Random clinical surveillance
d) Laboratory investigation of suspect cases
2.2 A Level B-1 alert is declared when a List A disease occurs in a
neighbouring country and its spread into Greek territory is considered
probable and imminent.
Standard precautionary measures include, in addition to those described in
paragraph 2.1:
a) An updated census of susceptible animals in areas at risk
b) Publicity and awareness campaign aimed at the agricultural community at
the local level
c) Animal movement controls in areas at risk
d) Targeted clinical surveillance and serological screening
e) Supplementary measures, depending on the disease
3. Results of surveillance available to date
3.1 The results of clinical surveillance are negative to date throughout
Greece, and in particular in Evros and Rodopi.
3.2 The results of preliminary serological screening in Evros and Rodopi
are presented in Table 2. Serological tests were carried out at the Athens
Laboratory of Virology by means of AGID (agar gel immunodiffusion) and
ELISA techniques, the latter in combination with monoclonal antibodies.
Table 1. Bluetongue virus susceptible livestock population in Evros and
Rodopi (1998-99 census)
Evros
Bovines sampled: herds: 1358, Animals 14, 239
Sheep/Goats sampled: flocks: 1402, Animals: 148 943
Rodopi Entire Pref.:
Bovines samples: herds: 3093, Animals: 19 920
Sheep/Goats sampled: Flocks: 2336, animals: 227 275
Rodopi Areas at risk*
Bovines sampled: herds:1194, animals: 9637
Sheep/Goats sampled: flocks: 696, animals:104 834

Table 2. Results of preliminary serological screening for bluetongue
carried out in Evros and Rodopi
Evros, date of sampling: 3-6 Aug 1999 Bovine: Total: 115, Positive: 13
Ovine: Total: 71, Positive: 0
Caprine (goats): Total: 80, Positive: 0
Rodopi, date of sampling: 5-6 Aug 1999
Bovine: Total: 160, Positive: 6
Ovine: Total: 548, Positive: 7
Caprine (goats): Total: 80, Positive: 0

Note: results for Rodopi are based only on AGID; ELISA is in progress.
4. Discussion of preliminary results of serological screening in Evros and
Rodopi
4.1 On the basis of the serological results presented in Table 2, a primary
incursion of bluetongue in Evros and Rodopi can be established on purely
serological evidence.
4.2 In Evros, infection appears to be geographically confined to the
vicinity of Petrades village, (north-western Evros) and Mandra village
(mid-eastern Evros).
The findings in Petrades are probably related to the cluster of outbreaks
reported the week before in the Bulgarian Province of Haskovo, the disease
spreading along the valley of the river Ardas.
The relatively high percentage of seroconversion observed in herds in the
two villages is consistent with the hypothesis of a recent and massive
wind-borne incursion of infected vectors from a known nearby source. The
outbreak in Mandra, on the other hand, may be independent of the other
outbreaks, both in Evros and in Bulgaria, and is the object of special
investigations.
4.3 In Rodopi, there is low sporadic evidence of seroconversion, indicating
either a low level incursion of wind-borne infected vectors from an unknown
source to the north or animal movement.
The first hypothesis is doubtful because of the presence of mountains
(altitude of more than 1500 m) along the border between Greece and Bulgaria.
However, if the origin of infection is to the north, it must be assumed
that the disease has spread beyond the Haskovo Province in Bulgaria and the
level of infection across the border is quite high. The second hypothesis
is highly unlikely, especially for bovines, because all bovines and most
sheep and goats in Rodopi are individually identified. The exact origin,
circumstances of incursion and the spread of the disease in Rodopi are
being further investigated. Until the situation in Rodopi has been further
clarified, no outbreaks will be declared.
4.4 In all cases, blood with EDTA has been collected from sero-positive
(and probably viraemic) animals in an attempt at virus isolation and typing.
5. Follow-up measures taken in the light of preliminary serological screening
5.1 Measures imposed on sero-positive herds in Evros and Rodopi:
a) Killing and destruction on the spot of sero-positive animals.
b) Intensive application of vector control measures inside and nearby
infected premises by means of anapproved insect-repellent.
c) Regular sampling (every week) of all remaining sero-negative animals
with a view to monitoring the presence and activity of bluetongue virus and
the efficacy of vector control measures.
d) Emergency vaccination is NOT contemplated by the Greek Authorities.
5.2 Measures taken or planned in the entire territories of Evros and Rodopi
a) A Level A-1 alert has been declared, signifying primary incursion from
an exotic List A disease into the Greek territory.
b) Prohibition for movements of live susceptible animals, their semen and
ova from the entire territories of the Prefectures of Evros and Rodopi.
c) Standstill for animals within the Prefectures of Evros and Rodopi.
d) Large-scale targeted serological surveillance around the outbreaks, as
well as in the entire territory of Evros.
e) Placement of sentinel bovines in selected areas at risk in north-western
Evros and north and northeastern Rodopi and regular sampling thereof.
f) Application of vector control measures in likely vector breeding sites.
g) Placement of light traps in selected areas at risk and classification of
midges with a view to identifying the vector species involved and
monitoring its presence, population size and geographical distribution.
5.3 Notifications, publicity and awareness
a) A General Notice to the public and the media, accompanied by a detailed
report on the emergence and evolution of bluetongue in Evros, has been
issued and published on the Internet site of the Ministry of Agriculture
(http://www.minagric.gr). It will be regularly updated to reflect the
current situation.b) The OIE, the European Commission, FAO and the
neighbouring countries of Bulgaria and Turkey have been duly and promptly
notified.
