An outbreak of rust has occurred in Tolima
------------------------------------------
About 1000 families of coffee growers in northern Tolima are going
through a difficult crisis because of the appearance of an outbreak
of rust, especially in the [arabica coffee] variety caturra.
According to the Departmental Committee of Coffee Growers, the fungus
has spread over more than 2000 hectares (4942 acres), especially in
the municipality of Lebanon.

The director of the union, Gildardo Monroy, explained that this
phenomenon was due to the high humidity in the coffee plantations,
the omission of fertiliser applications, and opposition to the change
to a variety more resistant to diseases.

An intense campaign for the renewal of plantings is being undertaken
by technicians of the Federation of Coffee Growers to prevent the
expansion of the affected areas. Tolima authorities also announced
interest-free loans and grace periods for affected farmers.

Rust has returned to affect coffee growers
------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Agriculture said there were rumors that the disease
is mutating. It is estimated that in eastern Caldas 85 percent of the
[coffee growing] area is affected. Few farmers dare to calculate how
much of their coffee is damaged. Fewer data have been provided by the
Caldas Departmental Coffee Growers Committee and even less by the
National Federation of Coffee Growers [NFCG].

Despite this, everyone knows about the havoc the rust is wreaking in
Colombia. Over 37 000 hectares [91 430 acres] are regarded under
threat, equivalent to just over 4 percent of total production. The
major effect is in Caldas, the 2nd largest producer of coffee in the
country, especially in the east, where some officials say that an
area exceeding 5000 hectares [12 340 acres] is infected. So far there
are no concrete data.

The NFCG said that the area susceptible to rust in Caldas is around
2200 [hectares / 5440 acres]. However many of the coffee growers in
Marquetalia and Manzanares state that this number has doubled by now,
and that [the areas] are not only susceptible to, but already
infected by the fungus. In a tour of these municipalities, La Patria
[newspaper] found apparent damage. Many caturra plants have bare
branches and only 10 to 15 fruits. Coffee growers are thinking about
replacing the plants and seek funding.

The disease was last seen in Caldas over 25 years ago. There may be a
risk that the rust is mutating as most growers have never seen such
an aggressive disease, even in the same [caturra] variety.

[Coffee leaf rust (CLR; also called orange rust) is caused by the
fungus _Hemileia vastatrix_, one of the most feared pathogens of the
crop. Of the 2 coffee species grown commercially, _Coffea
arabica_(arabica or highland coffee) and _Coffea canephora_ (robusta
or lowland coffee), it affects only the former. It has destroyed
arabica plantings in many countries. Spores are spread by wind and
rain from lesions on the underside of the leaves.

Disease management relies mainly on multiple fungicide applications
during the rainy season. Rust-resistant cultivars exist, but the crop
is generally of poorer quality. More than 30 races of the fungus have
been detected, making it particularly difficult to establish durable
host resistance. While a new mutation is suspected in item 2 above to
explain the more severe symptoms, the recent outbreak may also be due
to a previously known strain that is new to the region. For more
information on CLR see ProMED-mail post no. 20071108.3631.
