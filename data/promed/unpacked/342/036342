Is it possible for you to add an addendum to this post making it clear that this young man did not become infected with Nm [_Neisseria meningitidis_] from eating contaminated food? I would really hate for anyone to come away with that mistaken notion.

I've worked on the public health side of meningococcal disease for 30 years and have never heard anyone suggest transmission via food.

[Many thanks to Kathleen Harriman for adding to the discussion. I agree that contaminated food was not only very unlikely to be the source for this particular patient's meningococcal infection, but foodborne transmission is very unlikely in general to be involved in the spread of _Neisseria meningitidis_.

A review of the literature fails to find documented cases of food serving as a vehicle for transmission of _Neisseria meningitidis_. Although sharing food is cited as a risk for contracting meningococcal disease (https://journals.lww.com/pidj/Fulltext/2000/10000/Household_crowding_a_major_risk_factor_for.9.aspx), sharing food or drink involves exchange of oropharyngeal secretions, as do other behaviors such as intimate kissing that are risks for contracting meningococcal disease; the oropharyngeal secretions are the source of _N. meningitidis_, not the food (https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/about/causes-transmission.html). - Mod.ML
