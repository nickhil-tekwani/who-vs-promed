The potentially lethal [bacterium _E. coli_ O157 has spread to nearly half
of English cattle herds and could soon be as big a threat to human health
and British agriculture as BSE and foot and mouth disease (FMD), a senior
government adviser has warned.
Hugh Pennington, professor of bacteriology at Aberdeen University and a
specialist in food hygiene, said the government should introduce a policy
of "zero tolerance" towards the [bacterium, which is already thought to be
causing about 1500 reported cases of severe food poisoning each year and
several times that number in unreported cases.
Pennington led the inquiry into Britain's worst _E. coli_ outbreak, which
killed 21 people in Lanarkshire in 1996 and made 500 others ill. It is
thought contaminated raw meat had been allowed to be in contact with cooked
meat. [Contaminated raw meat in contact with salad or unwashed cutting
blocks where other food is prepared, may also result in contamination of
other foodstuffs. - Mod.TG "We should be looking for vaccines or methods
of animal feeding and husbandry reversing its spread. In terms of public
health, it is already a much bigger problem than BSE and we ignore it at
our peril," he said.
He also warned the bacteria were now so common youth groups such as scouts
or schools should be banned from camping in fields that had recently held
animals.
Bill Reilly, professor of veterinary pathology at Glasgow University and
chairman of a government taskforce investigating the _E. coli_ threat, said
the [bacterium may also be spreading among Britain's 45 million sheep.
Pennington, addressing a meeting of the British Association for the
Advancement of Science in Glasgow last week, revealed new research showing
on English farms 44 percent of herds contained infected animals, while on
Scottish farms the figure was 25 percent.
_E. coli_ O157 was unknown until the late 1970s when it was detected as a
new strain in a food poisoning outbreak in America. It produces toxins
which cause bloody diarrhoea and which mainly attack the kidneys and brain.
Children and the elderly are particularly vulnerable, with about 5 percent
of those infected dying or suffering serious complications - more than 100
a year in Britain. Most infections spring from a breakdown in hygiene,
meaning that people inadvertently eat animal feces.
Pennington's studies show a cow taken for slaughter can have up to 10 kg of
dung embedded in its hide easily contaminating meat. _E. coli_ is killed
by thorough cooking, as long as the food exceeds 72C for at least 2 minutes.

[This article seems to be blaming everything on the cattle raiser/producer.
These bacteria have been around for long time. However, instead of blaming
the animal and its caretaker for bacteria that are normal, why not educate
the people who prepare the food in food hygiene. Hand washing is essential
in those preparing food, as is understanding that the cutting board used to
prepare the meat must be thoroughly washed with hot soapy water before
preparing salad, or other vegetables on the same cutting board. Likewise,
hand washing between handling of meat and handling of vegetables is
essentials. And let us not forget, washing the vegetables is important as
well. There is not more cross contamination of meat to other food stuffs
during the preparation in the home or restaurant than on the farm. Proper
cooking times and temperatures of meat are ignored. We would do well to
heed proper food hygiene first. - Mod.TG
