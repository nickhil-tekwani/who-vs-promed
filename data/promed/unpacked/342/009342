According to a statement by the Minister of Health, Dr. Ould Cheikh Baye M'Khaittrat, 13 deaths have been reported among 30 human cases of Rift Valley fever virus infection in Mauritania. The Minister stated that: "The indications are that the outbreak, which has occurred over a wide area, has begun to moderate after affecting a total of 30 people. The Minister stated also that some rumours circulating to the contrary are ill-founded. "The health authorities have taken all necessary measures to contain the outbreak," he stated. He added that meat should be cooked thoroughly before consumption, and milk should always be boiled before use, especially in areas where animal disease had been observed.

He stated that no new cases of Rift Valley fever virus infection had been reported for 5 days over the whole country, including Nouakchott. He added that: "The Department of Health is implementing measures to contain the virus and eradicate the disease. The Rift Valley fever situation is not now alarming because the rainy season, which is one of the factors favouring the spread of the disease, has ended."

After confirmation of the existence of the epidemic in animals, the Ministry of Rural Development obtained blood samples from 26 people and submitted the samples for analysis to the National Institute of Public Health; 9 samples tested positive for Rift Valley fever virus infection; 9 were negative, and the remainder are still being examined.

[Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a viral zoonosis that primarily affects animals but also has the capacity to infect humans. Infection can cause severe disease in both animals and humans. The disease also results in significant economic losses due to death and abortion among RVF-infected livestock. The vast majority of human infections result from direct or indirect contact with the blood or organs of infected animals. The virus can be transmitted to humans through the handling of animal tissue during slaughtering or butchering, assisting with animal births, conducting veterinary procedures, or from the disposal of carcasses or fetuses. Certain occupational groups such as herders, farmers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians are, therefore, at higher risk of infection. There is some evidence that humans may also become infected with RVF by ingesting the unpasteurized or uncooked milk of infected animals.

On 4 Oct 2012, the Mauritanian Ministry of Health reported that 7 human cases of Rift Valley fever had been recorded in the country, resulting in 4 deaths; 2 of the survivors were recovering, and one was still under treatment. The extent of the outbreak in livestock has not been reported. Although the number of human cases has risen to 30 with 13 deaths, it is considered that the outbreak is declining because of the prevailing weather conditions.

However, this coming weekend marks the festival of Eid Al Adha, also known as Eid El Kebir. Many sheep will be slaughtered as part of the festival rituals around the country. Past experience has shown (e.g. in Egypt in 1977 and 1978) that during the slaughtering procedures, blood aerosols may expose attending humans to RVF infection.

Nouakchott is the capital and the largest city of Mauritania. The city is the administrative and economic centre of Mauritania. The interactive ProMED/HealthMap of Mauritania can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/3OL_. - Mod.CP]
