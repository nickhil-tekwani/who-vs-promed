In Darfur's East Jebel Marra, 2 more children have died of fever. They died in Wadi Oshar, northeast of Mashrou Abu Zeid, on Fri [10 Apr 2015]. A relative of the victims told Radio Dabanga that [an 8-year-old] and [a 5-year-old] died of a high fever, accompanied by vomiting and swelling of the hands and eyes. He said that children in particular are infected by the unknown fever, which is spreading fast in the villages of East Jebel Marra, and attributed the rising death toll to the absence of medicines and health care in the area.

The source appealed to relief organisations to access the region "as soon as possible" to identify the diseases, and provide treatment to the patients.

[There have been multiple reports of undiagnosed illness in the refugee camps in the Darfur region of Sudan in the past several years.

Darfur is a region in western Sudan and comprises 5 states (Central, East, North, South and West Darfur) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan). For maps of Sudan that show the Darfur region, see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Political_Regions_of_Sudan,_July_2010.svg
http://sites.duke.edu/stefanijones/files/2011/12/Map-of-Sudan-UN.jpg and
https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=3293516,9.

This region has many displaced people living in camps as a result of armed conflict where malnutrition is compounded by extreme overcrowding, shortage of clean water, inadequate latrines and appalling sanitary conditions. Many families have no shelter other than small, tarpaulin-covered huts that are highly vulnerable to heavy rains and winds. However, the news release does not state the conditions in which the children were living before their deaths.

With the limited information provided, it is difficult to speculate on which diseases could be circulating in the displaced person camps. ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving additional information about this outbreak from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML]
