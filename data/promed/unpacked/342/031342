The incidence of influenza-like-illness (ILI) has exceeded the normal baseline level in 6 regions of Russia, according to Gennady Onishchenko, the Director of Rospotrebnadzor [Federal Service for Consumer Protection and Human Welfare]. According to the Rospotrebnadzor announcement, as well as in Moscow city and district, the threat of an epidemic of respiratory disease [influenza-like illness/ILI] also applies to the regions of Pskov, Saratov, Perm, Nenets and Yamalo-Nenets. Isolated outbreaks have been observed already in the cities of Ivanovo, Ryazan, Murmansk, Cheboksary, Kirov, Ulyanovsk, Ekaterinburg, Yakutsk, and Naryan-Mar. Outbreaks of adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, and respiratory syncytial virus infection have also been recorded in addition to ILI.

The Ministry [of Health] has reported that seasonal influenza vaccination is close to completion. Vaccination of more than 37 million people, which represents 25.9 per cent of Russia's population was funded by the Federal Budget, and in addition more than 3 million people have been vaccinated privately or through funding from regional budgets. The lowest uptake of vaccine was recorded in the Murmansk and Novgorod regions.

The Director of Rospotrebnadzor has stated that a country-wide epidemic of influenza is unlikely to occur before the end of the year. The rise of an epidemic will increase after the end of the New Year holidays [January 2013].

[According to the most recent EuroFlu bulletin (see ProMED-mail Influenza (114): Europe 20121221.1463863), the influenza season has begun in the WHO European Region, with growing numbers of countries in different parts of the Region reporting sporadic co-circulation of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and type B viruses, though influenza activity is still at a low level. Further, the percentage of influenza-positive sentinel samples has increased over the past 2 weeks (from 6 per cent to 15.8 per cent) together with the number of specimens tested for influenza, indicating the start of the influenza season.

The Rospotrebnadzor statement suggests that a similar situation now pertains to several regions of Russia. - Mod.CP]
