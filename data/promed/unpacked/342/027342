Canada: First Human Case of Avian Influenza A (H7N3) Infection confirmed
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A Canadian Food Inspection Agency contract worker, who visited poultry
barns in the Fraser Valley, British Columbia, outbreak zone, [has
contracted avian influenza virus infection], and other workers showing mild
cold-like symptoms are being tested. One unidentified man was quarantined
for several days when he became sick after working in the area. Health
officials told the Vancouver Sun that test results confirm the worker is
the first case of a human infection connected to the spread of the [avian]
virus.

While it is highly unusual for an avian influenza virus to appear in
humans, the worker recovered fully and does not appear to have suffered any
long-term effects. "We know he was exposed to the birds," said Dr. Andrew
Larder, medical health officer for the Fraser Health Authority. "It's
highly likely it's the same virus. It confirms the suspicion we had that it
was possible for these things [!] to cause infections. In this one
particular person, we've demonstrated he was infected with that virus."
Larder said there is no need for alarm over the discovery that H7-type
virus --- the avian influenza virus found in poultry farms in Matsqui,
British Columbia, which is leading to a massive slaughter of 375 000 birds,
has been detected in a worker. Health officials have been saying that avian
influenza virus rarely transfers over to humans. Larder added on Friday
that the positive result from the infected worker does not mean the virus
is becoming more easily transmitted to humans. "It means there are people
who can be infected with the virus.

The human case is not an indication that the avian influenza A (H7N3)
virus --- a deadly form of the virus for chickens --- is mutating or the
cross infection is a signal that the number of avian influenza cases is
higher than previously calculated, Larder said. The sample from the
infected worker showed that it was H7 virus. In Asia, the more virulent
avian influenza A (H5N1) virus has killed millions of birds, but only about
35 [as yet only 34 confirmed by WHO - Mod.CP] people have been infected.

The worker who had been in Matsqui was held in isolation at a health unit
set up by the health authority and was released more than a week ago after
being quarantined. He is not being monitored further. Ten other workers who
have been working in the area in the past few weeks have also developed
symptoms. None of the illnesses are serious, Larder said. The symptoms by
the workers included conjunctivitis --- where mucus between the inner
eyelid and eyeball becomes infected --- and upper respiratory ailments such
as coughing and sore throats.

Larder said the health authority has samples from half of the workers which
are being tested now to determine whether any more people were infected
with the virus. On Thursday, provincial medical health officer Dr. Perry
Kendall issued a recommendation that workers in the Fraser Valley "hot
zone" take Tamiflu [a neuraminidase inhibitor known to diminish severity of
symptoms] and get flu shots. While Kendall said the possibility of
transmission was remote, the combination of the drug Tamiflu and a flu shot
is recommended for anyone working with carcasses being removed from the sites.

In barns all over a 5-kilometre radius in the agricultural area known as
the Matsqui Prairie, contract workers and CFIA employees have been clearing
carcasses of birds and preparing the slaughter of thousands more chickens
and turkeys. The massive cull was a drastic but necessary step, producers
said, to stem any further contamination. Avian flu has been detected in 5
commercial operations.

Concerns about the safety of workers were raised weeks ago by Julia Carter,
officer manager of Labour Unlimited in Abbotsford. Carter said she was
approached by a government official to send a crew of workers to the farms
to remove carcasses soon after news of the first infection broke in late
February. "Our guys are used to manual labour. They've done construction
work, but they didn't want to do this job because there was no talk about
safety equipment," she said. Carter said the day labourers were extremely
concerned about the conditions in the barns.

Meanwhile, Canadian Food Inspection Agency regional veterinarian Dr.
Cornelius Kiley was taken aback by news of the case of human infection.
Kiley said that workers have been properly equipped with disposable
coveralls, goggles, hairnets and plastic disposable boots. "These are good
bio-security measures that are well-recognized," he said Friday.

B.C. worker had mild form of avian flu
-------------------------
A person who handled dead chickens on a Fraser Valley farm contracted the
avian flu virus, the B.C. provincial health officer has confirmed.

Dr. Perry Kendall says it may be the first time the virus has been detected
in humans in Canada.

Health officials say it was the H7 variety of the flu, and not the same
strain [that was responsible for human deaths in] southeast Asia. [The H5N1
strain is the strain associated with human deaths in southeast Asia. The
H7N3 strain is the strain involved in the current outbreak in British
Columbia Canada. - Mod.MPP] Kendall says the H7 virus is not believed to
pose any serious risk to humans.

The man in question was working for the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. He
developed conjunctivitis, or pink eye, as a result of the virus, but
quickly recovered.

Several others who had contact with dead chickens after visiting
quarantined Matsqui-area poultry barns are being checked for avian flu.

Dr. Andrew Larder says 10 other workers have developed cold-like symptoms.
He says five have been tested so far, and health officials have determined
that none had avian flu.

[In 2003 an outbreak of avian influenza A (H7N7) virus in poultry in The
Netherlands was accompanied by about 80 cases of human infection among
workers carrying out the cull and the death of one veterinarian, possible
from an unrelated cause. The disease symptoms were mild and conjunctivitis
was common, possibly because the eye is a portal of entry for most
respiratory viruses. There was no evidence of person-to-person
transmission. The infection of the Canadian worker is the first report of
human infection by an avian influenza A (H7N3) virus. It is becoming
increasingly clear that individuals exposed to large amounts of avian
influenza viruses by the nature of their occupation are at risk of
infection. So far there has been no evidence of person-to-person
transmission of infection, but there is clearly a need for implementation
of stricter protective measures. - Mod.CP]
