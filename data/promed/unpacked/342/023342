Saudi Arabia: Recurrence of Hepatitis A in Asir
-----------------------------------------------
10 cases of hepatitis A have been registered in villages and schools along
the Asir coast [Asir is a province in the far southwest of Saudi Arabia,
near the Red Sea.]. The cases appeared on the same day among students of
Al-Shatea and Qur Memorization schools in Al-Qahma. The patients were
transferred to Al-Qahma General Hospital.
[A previous outbreak of hepatitis A] was [controlled] some months ago
following its appearance in Al-Birk, Al-Qahma, Al-Sawalha areas and the
neighboring centers. The Asir governorate formed a committee comprising the
Directorate of Health Affairs, Directorate of Water, and the Municipality
in order to determine the reasons for the recurrence of the disease.
A state of emergency has been declared at Al-Qahma Hospital and neighboring
health centers like Prince Sultan Charity and the old Al-Qahma Center. In
Al-Mat village precautionary measures were taken. More than 450 students in
schools were vaccinated. Samples of drinking water were taken for analysis
to identify the causes for the reappearance of the epidemic. Probably the
reason is the mixing of sewage water with ground water as a consequence of
construction of a septic tank.
Hani Abu Ghazala, Asir Region director general of Water, said that the
committee that has been formed is headed by the Asir governorate.
Preliminary analyses indicate that the causes of the epidemic include
irrigating vegetable farms with sewage water in addition to [the practice
of] drilling septic tanks to depths without building them. This caused the
mixture of sewage water with the groundwater. He said that the directorate
has speedily implemented the royal order to provide citizens with drinking
water. A contract was signed with a contractor to fetch potable water by
tanker trucks. As to the cause of the epidemic, it will be determined in
the coming few days and the situation will be tackled, he said.
Mousa Mash ouf Yahya, assistant director of Al-Qahma Hospital, said that as
soon as the epidemic was discovered, a team from the Preventive Medicine
Department in Asir visited the locations where cases were identified and
vaccinated male and female students in schools as a precaution. Yahya said
that the number of cases has reached 13 and the necessary measures have
been taken for their treatment. The results of the water sample analysis
are still awaited, he said.

[The incubation period for hepatitis A is between 2 and 6 weeks, and many
infections are silent, especially in young children. Nonetheless, it is
unlikely that there was any direct transmission between individuals since
the preceding outbreak of disease in this region. Hepatitis A virus is
excreted in large amount in liquid faeces for a brief period around the
time of onset of jaundice, and the excreted virus can survive for long
periods in surface and ground water. The design and construction of septic
tanks is likely to be the crucial factor in preventing further recurrence
of the disease. - Mod.CP]
