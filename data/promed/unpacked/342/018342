This update is based on a press release issued by the WHO Office in
Afghanistan.
The World Health Organisation in Afghanistan reports a very serious and
widespread national outbreak of acute diarrhoea and suspected cholera. A
sharply increasing number of cases of severe acute diarrhoea have been
reported from the northern, northeastern, central, eastern, southern and
southeastern regions of Afghanistan.
In Kabul, a Task Force including the Ministry of Health, WHO, UNICEF and
ICRC was established to mobilise available resources, but more funds are
required to secure the safe drinking water supply to bring the outbreak
under control there. Funds or contributions in kind are also desperately
needed to airlift medical supplies to the North and North-eastern Regions
as well as to implement water and sanitation measures to control the
outbreak in all regions.
In the Central Region, the WHO sub-office reports that more than 10,000
cases of acute diarrhoea, especially among women and children, have been
registered in the 59 health facilities in Kabul over the last ten days with
a few deaths. As the safe water situation is deteriorating in the city, the
death rate is likely to increase.
In the Northern and North-eastern Regions where access is difficult, the
case fatality rate is 3-15%. From Baghlan, the Swedish Committee of
Afghanistan reports 3,500 cases of severe acute diarrhoea with 102 deaths
and from Takhar 300 cases with 8 deaths. The outbreak may have spread also
to Samangan Province. >From Kunduz, the WHO sub-office reports 128 cases of
severe acute diarrhoea and 20 deaths, and from Badakhshan Province, 26
cases and 6 deaths.
