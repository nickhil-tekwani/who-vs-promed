Yes, in the ELISA, our experiece, we observe cross reactivity between
dengue and yellow fever for IgG antibody, but very low to none for IgM
antibody.

[When the patient has had an infection with one of the dengue viruses, then
that patient's serum might react strongly with yellow fever antigen by IgG
ELISA. When the patient has had yellow fever virus infection then that
patient's serum will not react at all, or to very low titer, with antigens
of any of the dengue viruses. Duane Gubler, Director of the CDC's Division
of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases, wrote to let us know that he agrees
with my comments. This points out the complexity of serodiagnosing
flavivirus infections. Karl Johnson once called the flaviviruses "a hall
of mirrors". If one does not know what one is doing one has the opportunity
of ruining one's reputation. Clearly Doug Watts is looking at the
infections from the dengue side and those serodiagnosing yellow fever cases
are looking at it from the opposite side. Last summer's SLEV vs WNV
complexity is a classic case. There are many more, as there are nearly 60
flaviviruses, many of which can cause human infections. - Mod.CHC
