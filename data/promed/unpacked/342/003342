Another case of measles exposure has been reported at O'Hare International Airport, the 2nd instance there in 5 days. The infected person was at O'Hare International Airport's Terminal 5 on [9 Jan 2019] and could have exposed others at the airport to the disease between 8:30 a.m. and noon that day, according to a statement from the Illinois Department of Public Health.

Hospitals and healthcare facilities are working to identify all possible areas of exposure and notify susceptible patients, staff, and visitors.

The 1st reported case in 2018 involved a passenger on a flight that landed at Terminal 5 [Wed 10 Jan 2018] morning. Health officials said the 2 did not become infected while at O'Hare airport but had already contracted measles. The timelines for exposure at the office plaza [are listed in the report at the URL above].

In the [Wed 10 Jan 2018] case, after arrival, the affected individual did not leave the airport and departed on a domestic flight several hours later. People who have not received a measles vaccination are asked to get themselves checked.

For more information about measles, contact your health care provider, or visit the Illinois Department of Public Health website. The agency said that passengers who have not been vaccinated could start to develop symptoms as late as [31 Jan 2018]. At highest risk are people who have not been vaccinated, state officials said. "Getting vaccinated not only protects you, it protects others around you who are too young to get the vaccine or can't receive it for medical reasons".

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that measles is "a serious, highly contagious disease" that is "easily" spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The department says there's no measles outbreak at O'Hare, which served 78 million passengers in 2016. The CDC states that most measles cases in the USA result from global travel, and warned travelers to make sure they are protected against the disease before they go overseas.

The Human Rights Ombudsman in Guatemala (PDH), Jord√°n Rodas Andrade, warned today [Sun 21 Jan 2018] that the case of measles confirmed by the health authorities of the country is due to low vaccination coverage dating from 2014. Vaccination coverage (...) in girls and boys from 12 to 23 months in the metropolitan area is 69.9 percent", which had a "downward trend of 1.9 percentage points", said the ombudsman.

The PDH added that "until the epidemiological week 40 [1 - 7 Oct 2017], the coverage" did not exceed 25 percent ", according to the Department of Epidemiology of the Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance (MSPAS).

"Maintaining the coverage at 90 percent or more according to international norms and standards is what guarantees the interruption of the circulation of autochthonous viruses," such as measles, the magistrate of conscience warned in his statement.

Given the "latent risk" this implies for the country, after the Health portfolio confirmed the case of measles in a 17 year-old Guatemalan student, who was infected with the virus on his trip to Germany between November [2017] and the 1st days of the year [2018], the PDH demanded the Ministry comply with "the national public health surveillance protocol".

He also urged him "immediately" to carry out the "active search of cases at the institutional level, maintain the epidemiological cord, strengthen active surveillance and strengthen recovery actions of the vaccination scheme."

The confirmed case of measles is the 1st detected in the Central American country in the last 20 years.

As indicated by the Health portfolio in a statement released this [Sat 20 Jan 2018], in Germany more than 800 cases were detected between 2016 and 2017, while in the Americas reported 201; 119 in the United States; 45 in Canada; 34 in Venezuela and 3 in Argentina.

[On 27 Sep 2016, PAHO/WHO declared The Region of the Americas as the 1st in the world to have eliminated measles. This achievement culminated a 22-year effort involving mass vaccination against measles, mumps and rubella throughout the Americas. The declaration of measles' elimination was made by the International Expert Committee for Documenting and Verifying Measles, Rubella, and Congenital Rubella Syndrome Elimination in the Americas. The announcement came during the 55th Directing Council of the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO), which was attended by ministers of Health from throughout the Americas.

Measles is the 5th vaccine-preventable disease to be eliminated from the Americas, after the regional eradication of smallpox in 1971, poliomyelitis in 1994, and rubella and congenital rubella syndrome in 2015 (from http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=12528&Itemid=1926&lang=en).

However, countries where measles is endemic still pose a risk to susceptible, non-immunized individuals in countries where measles has been eliminated, such as the case in this report. Since the beginning of 2017 and as of [28 Jun 2017], Germany has reported 766 cases. This is an increase of 15 cases since the CDTR [ECDC Health reports] on [30 Jun 2017]. In the same period in 2016, Germany reported 130 cases. Therefore, travelers to Germany are advised to take precautions and check their immunization status to measles.

This is a child who was not vaccinated. This is the 8th death case since the start of the outbreak," she said.

According to Suprun, 1285 adults and children have already caught measles in 2 weeks in 2018, compared to 4782 people with this disease in 2017.

She said that the largest number of cases of measles was registered in Ivano-Frankivsk, Chernivtsi, Zakarrpatia and Odesa regions and in the city of Kyiv.

At the same time, the minister said that there had been no fatality among over 1.3 million people who were vaccinated against measles last year [2017].

A measles outbreak and a spike in cases of malnutrition in Indonesia's easternmost Papua province have killed at least 95 people, mostly indigenous children, highlighting severely inadequate health care in the impoverished region.

An army chief in the provincial capital of Jayapura, Boni Christian Pardede, said 25 people in one subdistrict had died from malnutrition and an outbreak of diarrhea. He said the situation in mountainous Okbab subdistrict was first reported last week by church activists, who said 23 children and 4 adults had died. However, Pardede said the latest reports from a health team who had arrived there put the death toll at 25.

He said the military is planning to dispatch a 2nd team including doctors and paramedics from Jakarta on [Tue 23 Jan 2018]. Meanwhile, a health official in remote Asmat district said the death toll from a measles outbreak and malnutrition since September [2017] has risen to 70 people. The latest 2 victims were children who died [Sat 20 Jan 2018] in the state-run hospital in Agats, the main town of Asmat.

Papua and neighboring West Papua are the poorest provinces in Indonesia and home to a decades-old independence movement and armed insurgency. The region is culturally and ethnically distinct from the rest of Indonesia, which annexed it in the early 1960s. Its rich mineral resources have been exploited for decades by U.S. mining company Freeport, but indigenous Papuans have benefited little and are poorer, sicker and more likely to die young than people elsewhere in the country.

The Indonesian military sent a team of more than 50 doctors and paramedics last week to assist in the response to the measles outbreak.

[See post [5] for further discussion of Papua region of Indonesia. The lack of access to remote areas in this region and the high mobility of villagers hamper treatment and vaccination efforts. This situation is further exacerbated by malnutrition and poverty. It is hoped the governmental response will help curtail infection, but it may be too late for this current outbreak. - Mod LK]

A deadly epidemic of measles has spread in the Indonesian province of Papua, and so far 100 children have lost their lives due to the disease.

It is reported that children in the remote province also suffer from malnutrition and there has been an outbreak of chickenpox [varicella] as well.

It was initially feared that some 68 deaths have occurred in the mountainous Oksibil district alone, however according to church leaders the death toll could be in hundreds.

In order to combat the disease, the government has launched a program, which some believe will do little to no good. However, arrangements have been made for citizens to fly from Asmat to the country's capital, by helicopter. The military and the government have provided necessities like food, medical equipment and vaccines to the victims.

[A high proportion of children in the Indonesian province of Papua have not been vaccinated against measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella to the extent necessary to protect the population from infection. Lack of immunity plus malnutrition creates a serious health risk for the children in the region

It is hoped that the government's efforts to send food, medical equipment, and vaccines to the capital will help stop the outbreaks of these 2 vaccine-preventable diseases. The varicella vaccine is given by injection when children are between 12 and 15 months old, followed by a booster shot for further protection at 4 - 6 years of age.

Local health officials say 63 children died of measles and pneumonia diseases over the last 9 months in western Ghor province amid lack of child health specialists. The officials said despite taking measures to control the diseases, the number of children affected was increasing each day.

Dr. Jumma Gul Yaqobi, head of Ghor Civil Hospital, in an exclusive interview with Pajhwok Afghan News confirmed receiving 4700 children suffering from measles and pneumonia over the last 9 months. He said of the children, 58 lost their lives. He added that the number of children suffering from measles disease increased in last 2 months and 5 children had so far died of the disease in this period.

"Most of those losing lives were brought to the hospital late and were less than 1 year of age; the signs of this disease include fever, cough, runny nose, anorexia sweat and some other signs that could be found in children less than 9 months of age," he said.

Yaqobi pointed out that cold weather, non implementation of vaccine, poverty, malnutrition and parents carelessness were reasons behind the increase of the diseases. "It is known to all that Ghor is one of cold and economically poor province, some of its areas are influenced by militants who do not allow vaccination of children, families also pay less attention to their children's health, these reasons in general can increase diseases in children," he said.

On the other hand, a number of Ghor residents complained about lack of access to children's health specialists and said their patients remained hospitalized in the Ghor Civil Hospital for a long time without being cured.

Abdul Baqi, who brought his child suffering from pneumonia to Ghor Civil Hospital, said he wandered in the hospital for 20 days to seek treatment for his child. "I came 20 days ago from Shahrak district to this hospital and since we are here waiting for our child to recover, but the doctors are careless about us, they check the patient only once in 24 hours, if someone has connections with the doctors, their patient is checked hourly," he said.

The Ghor Civil Hospital head agreed with these complaints to some extent and said there was no children specialist in the hospital where sometimes the number of child patients reached dozens. "This is why children's diseases are not properly diagnosed."

Provincial acting public health director, Abdul Latif Rahimi, also said they recently registered 54 cases of pneumonia in children from areas on the outskirts of Firozkoh city, the provincial capital and 2 of the children lost their lives.

He said 50 percent of children in Ghor did not receive pneumonia vaccination and that was the reason of the high number of children's deaths from the disease. "The number of deaths from these diseases is high but statistics could not be collected from some areas due to impassable routes," he said.

"We have 54 cases from areas on the outskirts of Firozkoh city, 2 persons died from measles disease. Pneumonia diseases has also increased and is rapidly spreading, that is because half of our children do not receive vaccination for several reasons including insecurity," he said.

Rahimi confirmed the absence of children's health professionals in Ghor Civil Hospital and said the public health department had tried to employ children' health doctors but none of them were interested in work in Ghor. "MoPH provides many privileges to children doctors, but they don't show interest to work in the provincial civil hospital", he said.

Ghor officials say the provincial civil hospital is the only hospital with 180 beds that provides health services to nearly a million population of the province.
