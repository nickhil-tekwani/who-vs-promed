During the past months there has been a considerable increase in the number
of cases of malaria reported in tropical Cochabamba. According to Dr. Saul
Villaroel Alcazar, regional Chief of Malaria of the Health Department, there
needs to be a better strategy to slow the spread of the disease. In 1993,
Dr. Villaroel indicated that there were only to two areas of high risk:
Charcas, in the north of the Potosi, and Inquisivi, in the Department of La
Paz. However, the area of Cochabamba now affected by malaria is classified
as high risk "because the number of positive blood smears is exceeding 40%
which demonstrates the great damage that the disease is causing in the
country." In the opinion of Dr. Villaroel, the previous government
neglected the fight to eradicate diseases prevalent in the tropical region
of Cochabamba, these include malaria, yellow fever, leishmaniasis, dengue,
etc. In particular, Dr. Villaroel remarked that measures to control malaria
have been practically abandoned since 1994. Further, he remarked that there
has been a resistance of health authorities to investigate remote areas
lacking regular health care, apart from visiting data collection centers to
obtain figures about the incidence of some diseases.
