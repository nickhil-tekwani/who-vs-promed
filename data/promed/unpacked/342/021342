An old scourge: citrus postbloom fruit drop
--------------------------------------------

Postbloom fruit drop [PBFD] is a fungal disease that erupts during or shortly after the citrus bloom when flower petals and tiny fruitlets appear. The first symptoms are reddish brown spots on the petals that eventually expand into tan areas. The disease also causes the tree to shed the fruitlets, reducing the size of the harvest for the following season.

[Florida] growers were surprised last year [2014] with the return of the disease that hadn't erupted significantly since the 1990s. It most severely affects Navel oranges, but can also cause significant damage to Valencia oranges, the largest variety grown. PBFD first arose in Florida in 1983, major outbreaks occurred in 1993 and 1998, but [then] it largely faded.

Many growers acknowledged they hadn't been scouting for the disease [and] some reported losing 90 percent of a tree's fruit to it. Chris Oswalt, county citrus agent, said, "There were reports of more of it this year [2015], particularly in northern Polk County."

[Trees infected with] citrus greening, the fatal disease that arrived in Florida 10 years ago [ProMED-mail post 20050910.2683] have a longer and more irregular bloom period, said Natalia Peres, UF [University of Florida]. Greening is one of many diseases that stresses the tree, interrupting its normal bloom cycle. "If you have bloom extended over several months, chances (of contracting PBFD) are much higher," she said. Growers see bloom from January through [to April]. That contrasts with the historic bloom period of about six weeks in February and March.

Rain also contributes to spreading the fungus, said Peres.

[Both _Colletotrichum acutatum_ and _C. gloeosporioides_ have been reported as causes of post bloom fruit drop (PBFD) which can affect all species and cultivars of citrus. The disease is widespread throughout the subtropical Americas with serious crop losses reported in high rainfall areas. Symptoms include watersoaked lesions on petals which darken over time, premature drop of developing fruitlets, as well as lesions and distortions on leaves surrounding an infected inflorescence.

Fungal spores are spread by wind-blown rain, insects, human activities or with infected plant material. The fungi survive between seasons on leaves and twigs. Disease management mainly relies on timely applications of systemic fungicides and orchard sanitation.

Species and strains in the genus _Colletotrichum_ cause a range of anthracnose and other diseases on a wide range of crops. Some of the pathogens, including _C. acutatum_, are now considered species complexes.

Citrus greening (huanglongbing) was reported for the first time in the USA in Florida in 2005 (ProMED-mail post 20050910.2683). The report above illustrates the often unforeseen detrimental interactions between even unrelated pathogens occurring simultaneously in the same host.
