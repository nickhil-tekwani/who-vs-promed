[African swine fever occurs periodically in Southern Africa and is a
costly disease when it causes outbreaks. The high case fatality rate
makes it one of those diseases that local farmers and intensive
producers cannot easily withstand, thereby providing one of the more
challenging disease control problems for veterinarians and animal
producers in Africa.

In this particular case, the 2 outbreaks are located in different
provinces. Moreover, the outbreak in Dar-Es-Salaam does not indicate
a farm (or other epidemiological unit) and may therefore represent
pigs in marketing channels of one sort or another. If so, it would be
useful to know if traceback implicates the larger farm in Morogoro or
if we have to assume a 2nd source of disease spawned the outbreak.

The location of the outbreaks can be seen at the OIE reference above
