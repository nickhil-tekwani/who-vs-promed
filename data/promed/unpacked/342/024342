Syria cVDPV2 outbreak situation report no. 9, 15 Aug 2017
---------------------------------------------------------
Key highlights
--------------
Three new cases of cVDPV2 were reported this week from 3 new districts: 1 case from Deir ez-Zor district, Deir ez-Zor governorate; 1 from Boukamal district, Deir ez-Zor governorate; and 1 from Tadmour district, Homs governorate.

Five districts in 3 governorates are now infected.

The total number of cVDPV2 cases is 33 (this includes the previously reported 29 cases from Mayadeen district, Deir ez-Zor governorate, and 1 case from Tell Abyad district, Raqqa governorate). All confirmed cases to date have had onset of paralysis before 11 Jul 2017.

Final lab results for an additional 9 poliovirus type-2 (PV2) isolates from Deir ez-Zor are pending.

Discussions around expanding the scope of the immunization response to include accessible areas of a Tadmour sub-district in Homs, bordering Deir ez-Zor , will be held in light of the confirmation of the cases in this area.

Raqqa governorate commenced its 1st immunization round on [12 Aug 2017] (Raqqa and Thawra districts) and [13 Aug 2017] (Tell Abyad district). The immunization round aims to reach 120 000 children under 5 years of age. Preliminary information suggests the rounds are reaching children in all 3 districts.

Preparations continue for the 2nd round in Deir ez-Zor governorate, scheduled for [19-23 Aug 2017]. IPV [inactivated polio vaccine] for use in the 2nd rounds in Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa governorates has arrived in Damascus.

The total number of AFP [acute flaccid paralysis] cases detected in Deir ez-Zor governorate since the beginning of 2017 is 113 (83 from Mayadeen, 11 from Deir ez-Zor, and 19 from Boukamal districts). Raqqa governorate has reported 16 AFP cases (5 from Raqqa, 10 from Tell Abyad, and 1 from Thawra districts). Homs governorate has reported 26 AFP cases (11 from Homs city, 12 from Rastan, 1 from Tadmour, and 2 from Talkalakh districts).

The Eradication and Outbreak Management Group (EOMG) has approved the release of additional doses of IPV to cover high risk population groups in northwest Syria, Turkey, and Lebanon. Lebanon requested 144 000 doses and has begun to implement IPV campaigns across the country.

[Unfortunately transmission of the cVDPV2 in Syria has continued. With each report, the date of onset of the most recent case shifts to a date approximately one month preceding the report, probably reflecting the time it takes from specimen collection to appropriate reference laboratory. We are fairly sure there will be an additional 9 cases confirmed from Deir ez-Zor, as the report above mentions that there are 9 poliovirus isolates pending typing (WPV vs cVDPV). The report also mentions a significant number of AFP cases identified in the 3 governorates, suggesting there may be more cases in the pipeline for confirmation. The control activities have been implemented during this week and will be implemented in additional areas next week [week of 21 Aug 2017], so hopefully there will be interruption of transmission going forward.

The disturbing news in the situation report above, is that there is now involvement of 3 governorates. Deir ez-Zor, Raqqa, and now Homs. On a map of Syria showing provinces/governorates (http://www.freeworldmaps.net/asia/syria/syria-political-map.jpg), one can see that Deir ez-Zor, the main governorate involved in this outbreak is located in the northeast of the country sharing it's eastern border with Iraq. It shares a southern border with Homs, and a western border with Raqqa (Ar-Raqqah on this map) governorate. Hopefully the cVDPV2 will not continue to travel in the country outside of the currently 3 affected areas. - Mod.MPP]

[2] Somalia: declared polio free
Date: Mon 14 Aug 2017

http://allafrica.com/stories/201708150227.html


The UN World Health Organisation (WHO) said it had not recorded any case of polio disease in Somalia in the last 3 years, declaring the country polio free.

The WHO said the country recorded the last case of polio in 2014 in the central part of the country but has since then remained free of the paralyzing disease.

The UN health agency, however, warned Somalia remained vulnerable, calling for continued vaccination campaign, Xinhua [News Agency] reported.

The head of the WHO Eastern Mediterranean, which covers Somalia, Mohamed Fiqi said that massive vaccination campaigns and commitment from government and international actors had ensured the polio virus did not recur in the Horn of Africa country.

"As the world edges closer to eradicating polio, keeping alert in countries that have high risk of polio importation like Somalia is more of priority than ever," Fiqi said.

"As we move forward, the polio programme in Somalia needs to continue to work to maintain and improve the level of population immunity against polio through target vaccination campaign and strengthening of the routine immunisation services and infrastructure," Fiqi added.

The declaration by WHO keeps Somalia outside the last group of countries which still record cases of polio in the world.

Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan are the remaining countries where polio is still being recorded. The WHO chief warned Somalia remains at risk of importation of the virus from these countries.

Somalia President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmaajo praised efforts to rid his country of the polio disease which he noted had subjected many children into suffering.

"No cases were found for the past 3 years and no child was affected by this disease. Many of our children have suffered from polio for many years.

"To eradicate polio was a big success and it was collective effort and commitment by many young men and women who sacrificed their lives," Farmaajo noted.

The 3 year polio-free celebration comes amidst the worst outbreak of measles the country has seen in years.

Somalia is also still responding to an outbreak of acute watery diarrhoea/cholera, which began in January 2017. Polio systems and networks are being used in both interventions.

"Polio infrastructure has been critical in responding to these other serious outbreaks," said Fiqi.

[Achieving 3 years with no new cases of polio reported is a significant achievement for Somalia. That being said, it's important to remember that this too is a country with internal civil strife and warring factions, which may impede the identification of poliovirus associated disease either due to infrastructural challenges in good specimen collection and transport, or access of the population to the healthcare infrastructure. A reminder is the identification of WPV associated cases in Borno, Nigeria last year (2016), involving a virus last seen 5 years before in the same state.

Poliovirus weekly update -- as of 16-Aug-2017
---------------------------------------------
New wild poliovirus cases reported this week: 1
Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2017: 9
Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2016: 37

New cVDPV cases reported this week: 3
Total number of cVDPV cases in 2017: 40
Total number of cVDPV cases in 2016: 5

Headlines
---------
- Marking Pakistan's Independence Day [14 August] this week, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau paid tribute to both countries' ongoing collaboration, including on the effort to eradicate polio." Our 2 countries established a diplomatic relationship shortly after Pakistan was declared a sovereign nation in 1947. We continue to work together to advance shared priorities, including governance and democracy, regional security, poverty reduction, polio eradication, trade, defense, and the fight against climate change."

- The 14th Emergency Committee for polio eradication under the International Health Regulations met on [3 Aug 2017] and has made its recommendations to the WHO Director-General, who has accepted them. The Committee unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), and recommended the extension of revised Temporary Recommendations for a further 3 months. The key change is the inclusion of DR Congo and Syria in the category 'States infected with cVDPV2s, with potential risk of international spread'.

- Summary of newly-reported viruses this week: Afghanistan: 1 new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case; Pakistan: 1 new WPV1-positive environmental sample; Syrian Arab Republic: 3 new circulating vaccine-derived polio type 2 (cVDPV2) from Syria, 2 from Deir ez-Zor and 1 from Homs governorates. Details in country-specific sections below.

Afghanistan
-----------
- One new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week, bringing the total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 to 6. It is the most recent case in the country, and had onset of paralysis on [10 Jul 2017], from Zabul province, neighbouring Kandahar province and Pakistan.
- Afghanistan continues to coordinate activities with neighbouring Pakistan, to address both cross-border transmission and focus on reaching mobile populations with oral polio vaccine (OPV). Transmission linking both countries runs primarily across 3 corridors, namely: eastern Afghanistan and Khyber-Peshawar, Pakistan; greater Kandahar/Helmand and Quetta, Pakistan; and, Paktika/Patkya/Khost and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa/Federally Administered Tribal Areas, Pakistan.

Pakistan
--------
- No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week; the total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains 3. The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on [11 Jun 2017], from Killa Abdullah, Balochistan.
- 1 new WPV1-positive environmental sample was reported in the past week, collected on [28 Jul 2017], from Quetta, Balochistan.
- A special vaccination round is being implemented during August 2017 targeting areas with recent polio cases and positive environmental samples. These include Rawalpindi/Islamabad and demographically connected areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Quetta Block, and parts of Karachi.
- Under the National Emergency Action Plan for polio eradication, the country is planning to implement 2 nation-wide and 2 sub-national vaccination rounds from September to December 2017.

Nigeria
-------
- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [21 Aug 2016] in Monguno Local Government Area (LGA), Borno.
- Nigeria continues to implement emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) strains affecting the country (last detected in 2016).
- Detection of the polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission and the urgent need to strengthen subnational surveillance.

Lake Chad Basin
---------------
- The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) (Borno, Nigeria in 2016) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) (Borno and Sokoto provinces in Nigeria in 2016) continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin and hence an outbreak response plan is being implemented as part of the response to the Nigeria outbreak.
- Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.

Central Africa
--------------
- No new cases of type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo). The total number of cVDPV2 cases this year [2017] remains 7, in 2 separate outbreaks: in Haut Lomami province (5 cases, with onset of paralysis of the most recent case on [13 Jun 2017]); and in Maniema province (2 cases with onset of paralysis on [26 Mar 2017] and [18 Apr 2017], with an additional isolate detected in a healthy individual with sample collection on [2 May 2017]).
- Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time. Outbreak response is taking place, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols, targeting more than 750 000 children under the age of 5 across the 2 provinces.
- The 1st mOPV2 round was implemented on [27-29 Jun 2017] in the 2 affected provinces; and the 2nd mOPV2 round ran from [13-15 Jul 2017] in Haut Lomami and [20-22 Jul 2017] in Maniema.
- Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries.

Middle East
-----------
- In Syria, 3 new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were officially reported in the past week. The total number of cases in this outbreak is 33. Onset of paralysis of these cases is between [3 Mar 2017 and 10 Jul 2017]. 31 of the cases are from Deir ez-Zor governorate (29 from Mayadeen district, one from Deir ez-Zor district, and one from Boukamal district); 1 case is from Talabyad district, Raqqa governorate; and, 1 is from Tadmour district in Homs governorate.
- Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time and would not change the operational situation, as outbreak response plans are being finalized and implemented, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols. Two vaccination campaigns are planned for both Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa governorates. If there is geographic spread, the extent of these campaigns will have to be adjusted.
- The 1st mOPV2 round in Deir ez-Zor was successfully carried out between [22-26 Jul 2017]. Independent post-campaign monitoring reflected coverage of 88.4 percent (based on caregiver recall). The 2nd round is planned for [19-23 Aug 2017], and will include mOPV2 and IPV.
- Raqqa Governorate started mOPV2 campaigns on [12 Aug 2017].
- Plans are being finalized to mitigate the risks of further spread from the outbreak zone to neighbouring areas and countries, including immunization of at-risk populations in northwest Syria, Turkey and Lebanon. Following confirmation of the case in Homs, discussions are ongoing to further extend the geographic reach of the outbreak response.

[This week's global update is similar to prior weeks in terms of low level identification of WPV1 associated disease (a single case confirmed in Afghanistan this past week), one positive WPV1 isolated from an environmental sample in Pakistan, and 3 newly confirmed cVDPV2 associated cases in Syria.

That being said, there have only been 9 confirmed cases of WPV1 associated paralytic disease worldwide this year (2017), compared with 37 cases reported last year (2016). In contrast there have been 40 confirmed cases of cVDPV2 confirmed this year (2017) compared with 5 last year (2016). As a reminder, outbreaks due to cVDPV's are considered as significant in the big picture of polio eradication, as they are due to vaccine polioviruses that have reverted in neurovirulence following passage through multiple individuals while circulating in the susceptible population. The goal of the polio eradication initiative is to interrupt transmission of both the WPV's and the cVDPVs. The presence of cVDPVs occurs when there are areas with low vaccination coverage where the vaccine virus (from the OPV) can continue circulating through the susceptible population.
