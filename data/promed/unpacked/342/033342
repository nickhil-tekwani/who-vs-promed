A central Indiana prison inmate has died after being among those confirmed ill with Legionnaire's disease amid an outbreak of the bacterial lung infection at the facility, state prison officials said. The inmate [a 38-year-old man, https://cbs4indy.com/news/relative-of-inmate-concerned-amid-legionnaires-disease-outbreak-in-pendleton-correctional/] from the Pendleton Correctional Facility died Friday [3 Dec 2021] morning at a hospital, the Indiana Department of Correction said.

The agency had announced Wednesday [1 Dec 2021] that 3 inmates had confirmed cases of the illness and 2 others had probable cases. All 5 inmates had been taken to hospitals for treatment, and prison system and health officials were working to determine the source of the outbreak at the facility about 25 miles (40 km) northeast of Indianapolis. [The 5 sickened men all live in 2 units of the maximum-security facility, https://www.wfyi.org/news/articles/incarcerated-man-dies-after-legionnaires-outbreak-at-pendleton-correctional-facility.]

The prison's hot water has been turned off during the investigation into the source of the illness, but the prison's toilets and drinking water are not affected, officials said. The _Legionella_ bacteria are spread through inhaled water droplets, such as mist or steam, and not person-to-person contact.

[_Legionella_ are Gram-negative bacilli that are found in both natural freshwater environments, like lakes and streams, and plumbing systems, such as showerheads and sink faucets, cooling towers, decorative fountains, hot tubs/spas, and hot water tanks and heaters. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 deg C (77-104 deg F) support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems.

Debilitated patients who are prone to aspiration may develop Legionnaires' disease following aspiration of _Legionella_-contaminated potable water, as well as inhaling a fine spray (aerosols) from water sources containing _Legionella_. Possible person-to-person transmission has also been described (http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356). _Legionella_ infection can be acquired less commonly by contamination of wounds.

Eradication of these bacteria from plumbing systems is often difficult. Long-term persistence within these water systems is favored by the intracellular location of _Legionella_ within several species of protozoa, where _Legionella_ replicate and which provide protection from environmental stressors, like biocides and heat treatment; the formation of biofilms allows adherence of _Legionella_ to the inner surfaces of the plumbing systems (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5835138/). _L. pneumophila_ have been shown to persist for long periods in biofilms in a viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state after exposure to a biocide or heat treatment (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515819/). Monitoring _L. pneumophila_ in water systems usually done by culture would miss VBNC _Legionella_, which can be revived by the subsequent addition of ameba (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18839249).

Genotyping the clinical isolates will help establish whether this is a common source outbreak if the genotypes match. Matching the genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_ will identify the environmental source for the individual cases. However, if the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping.

Three of the Pendleton Correctional Facility prisoners have been reported to have "tested positive," and 2 other prisoners received a "negative test result" (https://www.wfyi.org/news/articles/incarcerated-man-dies-after-legionnaires-outbreak-at-pendleton-correctional-facility), but we were not told the types of tests performed. If the test was the urinary antigen assay, only infection due to _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1, the most common cause of Legionnaires' disease, can be detected; Legionnaires' disease caused by other _Legionella_ species or serogroups will be missed. Culture on selective media, as well as PCR, of lower respiratory secretions (e.g., sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage) can detect any species or serogroup of _Legionella_ causing the disease. The CDC recommends performing both culture of lower respiratory secretions for _Legionella_ and the urinary antigen test (https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/clinicians/diagnostic-testing.html). PCR (if available) is rapid and has the additional advantage of high sensitivity (https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/jcm.02675-15?permanently=true).

Complicating the issue at the Pendleton Correctional Facility, another prisoner died from complications of COVID-19 this week (https://www.wishtv.com/news/local-news/child-molester-died-from-complication-from-covid-in-pendleton-prison-coroner-says/). At autopsy, this prisoner was reported to have tested negative for Legionnaires' disease; however, the type of test was again not specified.

Pendleton (pop. 4253 in 2010) is a town in Fall Creek Township, Madison County, Indiana, located about 35 miles (56 km) northeast of Indianapolis, the Indiana state capital (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendleton,_Indiana). The Pendleton Correctional Facility is located on the south edge of town.

More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
