A man died of jaundice after battling for his life at a hospital. The increasing number of casualties has sent alarm bells ringing among health officials of the region. Doctors at the health facility told Express News that 3 patients suffering from jaundice were admitted to the hospital in critical condition. They said the patients were being provided treatment, but the condition of one of them quickly deteriorated and he died during the treatment.

The victim was identified as a 70-year-old, a resident of Sahja. The other 2 patients who were being treated at the health facility were identified as a 55-year-old resident of Canal Park, and a 45-year-old resident of Chak No 229 [Punjab].

Similarly, jaundice cases continue to be reported at different health facilities across Rahim Yar Khan, including Tehsil [district] Headquarter Hospital in Sadiqabad, Tehsil Headquarter Hospital in Khanpur, and Tehsil Headquarter Hospital in Liaquatpur. The district has been badly affected with jaundice that has claimed the lives of several people in 2018. Data collected from different hospitals across the city showed that a large number of elderly people and children have suffered the deadly disease. While commenting on the situation, health experts told Express News that contaminated underground water and unavailability of water filtration plants are the main reasons contributing towards the spread of disease.

[Since hepatitis A is quite endemic in the region, cases in adults are uncommon as most people have been infected (usually asymptomatically as children). If viral hepatitis is the etiology here, therefore, it is likely to be hepatitis E. Fatalities with HEV are not uncommon in late gestation pregnant women or in individuals with comorbidities including co-infection with HBV and/or HCV. Leptospirosis, another waterborne pathogen, can present with jaundice and progress to death. Often, there is also renal failure due to the [leptospiral] bacterial pathogen. - Mod.LL
