The Public Health Agency of Canada is collaborating with provincial public health partners, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and Health Canada to investigate an outbreak of salmonella infections [_S._ Enteritidis] involving 6 provinces: British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec.

The source of the outbreak has not been identified, and the investigation is ongoing. Outbreak investigators are gathering information on possible sources. The outbreak appears to be ongoing, as illnesses continue to be reported. The Public Health Agency of Canada is issuing this public health notice to inform Canadians of the investigation findings to date and to share important safe food handling practices to help prevent further salmonella infections.

This public health notice will be updated on a regular basis as the investigation evolves.

As of 5 Apr 2019, there have been 63 laboratory-confirmed cases of _Salmonella_ Enteritidis illness investigated in the following provinces: British Columbia (23), Alberta (10), Saskatchewan (8), Manitoba (10), Ontario (10) and Quebec (2). Individuals became sick between November 2018 and March 2019. 18 individuals have been hospitalized. Two deaths have been reported; however, it has not been determined whether _Salmonella_ was a contributing cause in these deaths. Individuals who became ill are between 1-87 years of age. The majority of cases (57%) are female.

It is possible that more recent illnesses may be reported in the outbreak because there is a period of time between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported to public health officials. For this outbreak, the illness reporting period is between 4-5 weeks.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is conducting a food safety investigation. If contaminated food products are identified, they will take the necessary steps to protect the public, including recalling food products as required. Currently, there are no food recall warnings associated with this outbreak.

[This outbreak has been ongoing for 5 months. We await further information regarding a vehicle for transmission. In the past, many of the Canadian outbreaks of salmonellosis have been linked to chicken products. - Mod.LL
