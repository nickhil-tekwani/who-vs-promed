Acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) is a viral infection that predominantly affects children. Uttar Pradesh reported a total of 2871 cases of AES in 2019, out of which 83% (2389 cases) were from districts in the Gorakhpur region. The regional ecosystem in Gorakhpur comprises rivers, lakes, irrigation canals, reservoirs and rice fields and the flood-prone region is endemic for AES.

The Tata Trusts' initiative to combat AES, named Project Prayaas, aims to effectively prevent and control the spread of AES in this region. The intervention is focused on the 2 most vulnerable blocks in the district, and covers a population of over 200 000 people. An estimated 20 000 children will undergo tracking for fever or any kind of symptom.

Project Prayaas, which covers water and sanitation along with health care, performs the following health-specific interventions in this region:
- Track children (0-5 years) to ensure 100% coverage of Japanese encephalitis immunisation.
- Deploy well-equipped mobile medical units to strengthen the primary healthcare delivery system.
- Manage childhood illness by early identification, and prompt referral of AES cases, so as to prevent potential complications.
- Collaborate with the district National Vector Borne Diseases Control Project (NVBDCP) department and Armed Forces Medical College (AFMC), Pune, to execute vector control strategies.
- Execute community-based communication strategies to prevent AES.

[Although ProMED-mail has not received a report of Japanese encephalitis (JE) or AES in Uttar Pradesh state since 4 Jul 2019, it is evident that cases have continued to occur there. JE and AES cases with fatalities are reported in Uttar Pradesh every year. It is not clear from the report above the proportion of cases that are due to JE and what proportion are attributed to AES of unidentified etiology, although the inclusion of tracking children (0-5 years) to ensure 100% coverage of JE immunisation in the list of initiatives implies that a significant proportion of these cases are due to JE virus infections. Also, AES above is attributed to an unnamed virus. Interestingly, there have been cases of AES attributed by some to consumption of lychee fruit by malnourished children in neighboring Behar state. As noted in comments on previous posts, although lychee fruit consumption by malnourished children is the main suspected etiology of AES in recent Behar reports, apparently some scientists in India think that a virus, probably Japanese encephalitis virus, is responsible for some of the cases.

The determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive. As noted previously, some cases of AES are frequently attributed to Japanese encephalitis, but many are of undefined etiology. AES has continued to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heatstroke, lychee fruit consumption, and scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_). A recent publication states that dengue virus is one of the 3 most common agents identified in AES, but existing surveillance for AES does not include routine testing for dengue. One hopes that now by sending each sample to the National Institute of Virology, the presence of dengue and enteroviruses can be included or ruled out in AES cases. - Mod.TY
