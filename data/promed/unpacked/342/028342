The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) was cited
as saying Monday that the mysterious deaths of more than 50 California sea
lions in May were blamed on a naturally occurring toxic algae. Biologists
from the National Marine Fisheries Service and National Ocean Service added
that an algal bloom created a biotoxin called domoic acid that affects the
nervous system of animals, causing seizures, vomiting and sometimes death.
Almost 100 adult and juvenile California sea lions in obvious physical
distress washed ashore in late May along the California coast from San Luis
Obispo to Santa Cruz.
Rescuers from the Marine Mammal Center in Sausalito said that of the
animals they treated, more than 50 died and about 38 were still alive.
