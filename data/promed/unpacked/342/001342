Every year, from late December to early March, there is heavy rain in most
parts of Brazil. This year, the State of Minas Gerais was severely hit, but
by now there is no more rain. There are some freak years when there are
winter rains in the south, mostly in the State of Santa Catarina.
An excellent WWW site for brazilian weather is http://www.orion.cpa.unicamp.br.
