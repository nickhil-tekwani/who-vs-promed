Monkeypox
Zaire. Increased activity of monkeypox was reported in Katako-Kombe health
zone, Sankuru sub-region, Kasai Oriental during 1996 (see Weekly
Epidemiological Record No.43, 25 October 1996). Medecins Sans Frontieres
investigated those cases which could be traced in September 1996. Samples
were obtained from 11 cases all of which were subsequently confirmed as
monkeypox by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Smallpox and other Poxvirus
Infections at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in
Atlanta, USA. Concern about the unusual high number of cases and the
apparent increased transmission between human cases triggered a
multidisciplinary investigation in February 1997. A team was set up composed
of national experts, local WHO staff, staff from CDC, Atlanta, USA and
Epiet, Paris, France.
The report of the investigations will be published simultaneously in
forthcoming issues of the Weekly Epidemiological Record, the Morbidity and
Mortality Weekly Report and the Eurosurveillance bulletin.
