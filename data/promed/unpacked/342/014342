Officials could move to close Tasmania's [AUD] 330 million [approx.
USD 263.2 million] wild abalone fishery -- the largest in the world
-- after a devastating virus was detected in specimens at a
processing plant.

The abalone viral ganglioneuritis, which has a high mortality rate,
has already devastated wild abalone fisheries off Victoria.

The discovery of infected abalone at a southern Tasmanian seafood
processing plant has officials scrambling to determine if the virus
is present in wild populations off the state's southern coast.

Tasmania's chief veterinary officer Dr Rod Andrewartha said
everything possible was being done to establish the source of the
infection, including divers carrying out checks at key sites.

He said the infected specimens could have contracted the virus in the
wild or in tanks at the plant, which use recycled ocean water.

If the virus is found to be widespread, he said closures and
restrictions on processing would be enforced. "It is something we
need to resolve as quickly as possible," Dr Andrewartha said. "We
know affected areas can have very high mortality levels. There may be
closures to the fishery some time in the next couple of days."

The virus has been spreading slowly through waters off the Victorian
coast, decimating abalone populations there since 2005, and strict
bio-security measures are in place to isolate the Tasmanian fishery.

Dr Andrewartha said it was possible that the virus was endemic to
abalone and only kicked in when the animals were under stress. He
noted the 4 infected abalone taken from the plant's tanks had been
there for up to 12 days. "It's too early to speculate on the source
of the virus," he said.

He said the infected abalone had come from 2 known areas on the ocean
floor. Since the presence of the virus was confirmed, conditions have
allowed other specimens to be taken from only one of those sites.
They showed no sign of the virus, Dr Andrewartha said.

Dr Andrewartha said the processing plant's recycled ocean water could
not escape into the ocean, and was discharged on land.

Government officers are working to clean the plant and only abalone
approved by the Department of Primary Industry and Water can leave
the site.

Tasmanian Abalone Council president Greg Woodham said that at this
stage, the discovery was being treated as an isolated incident
confined to the plant. "The factory is now under a bio-security
management protocol and it's early days yet. We don't believe there
is an outbreak, yet," he said. "There are all sorts of other
possibilities that need to be investigated."

Mr Woodham and the Tasmanian government say the isolated fishery
supplies more than 25 per cent of the world's annual wild abalone
harvest.

The annual landed catch is valued at [AUD] 110 million [approx. USD
87.6 million], and its export worth is multiplied by a factor of 3,
to [AUD] 330 million [approx. USD 263.2 million], they say.

[Ganglioneuritis is an interesting condition causing inflammation in
the nervous tissue, which swells. The result is curling of the
abalone foot and swelling of the mouth. Thus, the organism cannot eat
and looses its grip on the rocks it so depends on.

Abalone viral ganglioneuritis (AVG) is a highly virulent herpes-like
virus, undescribed in Australia before 2005, and still not well
characterized. The virus affects the nervous tissue of abalone and
rapidly causes death. The virus can be spread through direct contact,
through the water column without contact, and in mucus that infected
abalone produce before dying. The virus is thought to survive only a
short time when out of a moist environment.

AVG affects both blacklip and greenlip abalone and hybrids of these 2.

In June 2006, coastal waters off Port Fairy were declared a Control
Area under the Victorian Livestock Disease Control Act (1994), as the
disease is listed as notifiable. Fishing and diving activities in the
Control Area were restricted to minimize the risk of human activity
transferring the disease to unaffected abalone populations elsewhere
in the State.

Abalone shell, viscera (meat and gut) should not be
- shucked (taken from the shell) at sea,
- dumped into the sea,
- used as fishing bait.
