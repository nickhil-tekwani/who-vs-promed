Improper handling of intravenous saline at a West Virginia outpatient oncology clinic was linked with the 1st reported outbreak of _Tsukamurella_ spp., gram positive bacteria that rarely cause disease in humans, in a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The report was published in the March [2014] issue of Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology, the journal of the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America.

"This outbreak illustrates the need for outpatient clinics to follow proper infection control guidelines and medication preparation practices to minimize the risk of infection for patients with weakened immune systems," said Isaac See, MD, lead author of the study. "A combination of careful descriptive epidemiology with attention to outlier cases, direct observations, and analytic studies was needed to support this investigation, which pointed to deficiencies in medication preparation practices as the cause of these unusual infections."

From September 2011-May 2012, 15 immunocompromised patients developed _Tsukamurella_ bloodstream infections. All patients had received a diagnosis of malignancy, and had an indwelling central line, although central line types varied. A case-control study determined that the only risk factor for developing _Tsukamurella_ infection was the receipt of saline flush, prepared by the clinic staff from large preservative-free bags of saline during September-October 2011.

Investigations by the West Virginia Bureau of Public Health (WVBPH) and the CDC found several lapses in infection control procedures relating to the care of long-term intravenous catheters and preparation of chemotherapy for patients at the clinic. These investigations also suggested that saline flush syringes were the likely source of infection.

Following the recommendations of WVBPH and CDC, the clinic instituted several changes to its infection prevention and control practices; including using pre-packaged manufactured saline flushes. After the clinic changed this practice, _Tsukamurella_ bloodstream infections stopped occurring, further supporting the saline flush as the source of infection.

To help outpatient oncology facilities establish appropriate infection control strategies, the CDC developed a basic infection control plan tailored to these settings, outlining key policies and procedures needed to meet minimal requirements for patient safety. These include the proper use and handling of injectable medications and correct procedures for assessing central lines. Outpatient oncology facilities without an existing plan are encouraged to use this document as a starting point.

[The news release above refers to a recently published article: See I, Nguyen DB, Chatterjee S, et al: Outbreak of _Tsukamurella_ spp. Bloodstream Infections among Patients of an Oncology Clinic -- West Virginia, 2011-2012. Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol 2014; 35(3) (March): 300-6. DOI: 10.1086/675282, available at http://www.jstor.org/stable/full/10.1086/675282. The abstract is reproduced below:

"Objective: To determine the source and identify control measures of an outbreak of _Tsukamurella_ species bloodstream infections at an outpatient oncology facility.

"Design: Epidemiologic investigation of the outbreak with a case-control study.

"Methods: A case was an infection in which _Tsukamurella_ species was isolated from a blood or catheter tip culture during the period January 2011 through June 2012 from a patient of the oncology clinic. Laboratory records of area hospitals and patient charts were reviewed. A case-control study was conducted among clinic patients to identify risk factors for _Tsukamurella_ species bloodstream infection. Clinic staff were interviewed, and infection control practices were assessed.

"Results: 15 cases of _Tsukamurella_ (_Tsukamurella pulmonis_ or _Tsukamurella tyrosinosolvens_) bloodstream infection were identified, all in patients with underlying malignancy and indwelling central lines. The median age of case patients was 68 years; 47 percent were male. The only significant risk factor for infection was receipt of saline flush from the clinic during the period September-October 2011 (P = .03), when the clinic had been preparing saline flush from a common-source bag of saline. Other infection control deficiencies that were identified at the clinic included suboptimal procedures for central line access and preparation of chemotherapy.

"Conclusion: Although multiple infection control lapses were identified, the outbreak was likely caused by improper preparation of saline flush syringes by the clinic. The outbreak demonstrates that bloodstream infections among oncology patients can result from improper infection control practices and highlights the critical need for increased attention to and oversight of infection control in outpatient oncology settings."

_Tsukamurella_ are strictly aerobic, non-motile, non-spore-forming, gram positive bacilli that are a weakly or partially acid-fast with the modified Kinyoun stain. Related organisms are _Nocardia_, _Gordonia_, _Streptomyces_, and _Rhodococcus_. _Tsukamurella_ have been found in soil, sludge, and arthropods. Human infection has been described primarily in immunocompromised patients with cases of central catheter-related infection; peritonitis, and fatal meningitis [have also been] described. They have been found to be susceptible to amikacin, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, imipenem, and sulfamethoxazole and usually resistant to cefoxitin, cefotaxime, tobramycin, erythromycin and azithromycin.

Similar incidents to these point out the hazard of infection or cross-infection from either using injectable products intended for single use that are used more than once, or in more than one patient, or multidose preparations that are used in more than one patient, or multiple use of medications not containing preserving agents (Dade J, Wilcox M, Kay L: Hazards of multiple use of pharmaceutical solutions.

- an outbreak of meningitis caused by _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ attributed to intrathecal injection of contaminated contrast media from a multiple-dose vial used over 8 days (Mattner F, Gastmeier P: Bacterial contamination of multiple-dose vials: A prevalence study.
