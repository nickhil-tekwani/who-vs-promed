[1] Malaysia (Sabah), cVDPV1 associated AFP case
Date: 8 Dec 2019

A polio case has been confirmed in the country, the 1st in Malaysia in 27 years.

The Health Ministry confirmed that a 3-month-old Malaysian boy from Tuaran, Sabah had been admitted into a hospital's Intensive Care Unit after experiencing fever and weakness of limbs.

Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said the last polio case in Malaysia occurred in 1992, and in 2000, the country was declared as being polio-free.

In the recent case, the child was confirmed to be infected with the vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (VDPV1) on [6 Dec 2019] this year.

"The patient is currently undergoing treatment in an isolation ward and is in stable condition but needs respiratory support," he said in a statement Sunday [8 Dec 2019]. He added that the VDPV1 is classified as a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) type 1.

"The cVDPV originates from a poliovirus that has been weakened by the orally-administered polio vaccine. Those who have been vaccinated will be protected from infection. The weakened virus has been excreted from the body through the faeces. However, in unsanitary environments, the virus can infect others who have not been immunised against polio and will thus spread in communities whose polio immunisation rates are less than 95%. The longer the virus spreads in the community, it will undergo genetic mutation until it once again becomes an active virus," he said.

Dr Noor Hisham said test results showed that the virus has genetic links to the polio virus that was detected in a recent outbreak in the Philippines.

The Philippines in September this year [2019] declared an outbreak of polio, caused by VDPV1.

He added that up until [5 Dec 2019], investigations at the vicinity of the polio-infected child's residence found that 23 out of 199 people aged between 2 months to 15 years have not received the polio vaccine.

"This is a frustrating situation because the circulation of a cVDPV can only end with a polio immunisation.

"After explaining the importance of polio immunisation, the parents of the children have agreed to have them vaccinated," he said.

He added that surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) -- a clinical syndrome which is characterised by weakness of the muscles of respiration and swallowing -- will be conducted in the area.

"As of [5 Dec 2019], as many as 646 people have been checked, and symptoms of AFP have not been detected.

"To ensure that the polio virus does not continue to spread in Malaysia and infect those who are not immunised, vaccination activities will be continued in the area of this case and will be expanded to other risk areas," he said.

He urged members of the public to immediately seek treatment if they have AFP symptoms or to inform the Health Ministry if they know of other cases.

"The success in eradicating the disease previously was due to prevention efforts through the polio vaccination, which was introduced in the National Immunisation Programme in 1972. The programme was made even more effective when the vaccine was changed from being administered orally to being administered through injection," he said.

Polio, or poliomyelitis, is a potentially deadly infectious disease caused by the poliovirus and can cause paralysis by invading a person's brain and spinal cord. The disease has no cure and can only be prevented through vaccination.

[As the media report states, this is the 1st case of polio reported from Malaysia since 1992, 27 years ago. According to the genetic profile of the isolated cVDPV1, it is related to the cVDPV1 identified in the Philippines. It is not mentioned whether this is related to the cVDPV1 identified from environmental samples in the Manila metropolitan region or whether it is related to the paralytic case confirmed with VDPV1 in the Mindinao region (see below for details).

It is curious that cVDPV1 seems to be affecting mostly countries in Eastern Asia (Myanmar, Malaysia) and Western Pacific (Papua New Guinea and Indonesia) this year (2019). Since 2015, the countries reporting cVDPV1 associated AFP cases include Philippines, Myanmar, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Laos, Madagascar and Ukraine (http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/this-week/circulating-vaccine-derived-poliovirus/).

This now brings the total number of cVDPV associated acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases in the past 2 years to 24.

Tuaran, Sabah state is located on the northwest coast of Borneo island (https://www.mapsofworld.com/malaysia/malaysia-political-map.html). Of interest is that Basilan island, where the VDPV1 case has been reported, is one of the southernmost islands of the Philippines.

UNICEF-WHO Philippines: Polio Outbreak Situation Report No. 10 (3 Dec 2019)
-------------------------
Highlights
- No new cases reported in the past week - Currently 6 human cases confirmed with circulating Vaccine Derived Polio Virus type 2 (cVDPV2), and 1 case with type 1 (VDPV1), all from the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). There is also 1 case with immunodeficiency-related VDPV type 2 (iVDPV2) from Laguna.

- Synchronized polio vaccination campaign started on [25 Nov 2019] so far vaccinated 3 953 754 children under 5, which is 90% of the target total 4.4 million children under 5. With 5 more days to go, 99% of the target 1 276 993 children were vaccinated in National Capital Region (NCR) and 87% of the target 3 111 649 children in Mindanao.

- Typhoon Tisoy (Kammuri) may affect the 2nd week of the campaign operations in NCR due to heavy rain and possible flooding.

- Current polio outbreak resulting from persistently low routine immunization coverage, and poor sanitation and hygiene.

- Philippines is affected by both cVDPV1 and cVDPV2. cVDPV is considered a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC).

Current Situation
- Currently, 6 human cases and 13 environmental samples confirmed with cVDPV2, which are all genetically linked. All human cases were reported from BARMM, whereas environmental samples were found in NCR and Davao.

- All 13 cVDPV1 environmental samples found in Manila are genetically linked, whereas the 1st human case confirmed with VDPV1 from the island province of Basilan in BARMM was not found to be closely related to cVDPV1 detected in Manila, but with possible genetic linkage, which will be confirmed or not following pending evolutionary analysis.

- Case investigation into the VDPV1 case was conducted in Maluso, Basilan by Department of Health (DOH) staff from Manila jointly with the BARMM Ministry of Health, provincial and city health officers. Stool specimens were collected from 22 household members and children in the community, as well as environmental samples by Basilan sanitary inspectors.

[Apologies for the delay in posting this update, as the information on the VDPV1 isolated in Basilan, Philippines is of interest. Results of the contact testing and environmental sampling surrounding the Basilan case to further define what type of VDPV1 was identified are still pending.
