Notes:
It is possible for the status of a reported case to change over time. SARS
is a diagnosis of exclusion. This means that whenever a known cause is
found that could fully account for a patient's clinical condition, this
patient should no longer be considered to be a case of SARS.
+The Chinese authorities have reported suspect and probable cases in
Guangdong province. Figures are being updated.
Cumulative number of cases includes number of deaths.
* No documented secondary transmission in-country. No affected areas.
**One death attributed to Hong Kong SAR China occurred in a case medically
transferred from Viet Nam.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome - press briefing
--------------------------------------------------
World Health Organization: Dr David Heymann, executive director,
Communicable Diseases; Dr Guenael Rodier, director, Communicable Disease
Surveillance & Response (CSR); Dr Max Hardiman, medical officer, CSR; Dr
Klaus Stohr, scientist, CSR; Dr Julie Hall, medical officer, CSR; Mr Dick
Thompson, communications officer
Q. We understand that you are closer to identifying the cause of this
disease. Is that true? Could we have more information?
A. Dr Klaus Stohr: Since yesterday [Thurs 20 Mar 2003], 2 more laboratories
have identified the Paramyxoviridae virus in specimens from patients with
SARS. One of the laboratories could identify one of these viruses as a
virus that could be isolated with culture outside the patient. The tests
are currently ongoing. We are having another telephone conference today at
13:30. We really have to look at the data. We are cautiously optimistic.
But we also want to come out with the facts. We have to wait until we have
the data.
Q. Have you pursued this line of investigation in China as well? Has the
team arrived there?
A. Dr David Heymann: As you know, we have had reports from the Chinese
government on tests that theyve done and also on some organism that they
have identified. They have identified Chlamydia but incidentally. But they
dont think this is the cause of the outbreak. A WHO team will arrive this
weekend to review the records supplied by the Chinese authorities. We
expect to have more information available early next week. We are now
closer to reality that this Paramyxoviridae virus has caused this, you have
to realize this is a whole range of different viruses, from some that cause
measles and mumps and from some that cause common respiratory infections in
many people and which are sometimes even asymptomatic. Just because we
found it circulating in some people does not mean that it is not
circulating in others. A whole series of studies have to be done to find
out if this is the cause. And if this is the cause, what this extended
spread would be.
Q. Could you please expand on your statement that you are "cautiously
optimistic" that you have found the causative agent?
A. Dr Klaus Stohr: The WHO collaborating multi-centre project is turning
around data within one week which are normally distributed and digested and
look at in months or years. More and more laboratories are finding
Paramyxoviridae virus. What is promising is that many other Paramyxoviridae
viruses can be excluded. Hendra and Nipah virus have not been found, nor
have mumps and measles. Respiratory syncytial virus was found in few
samples. What is promising is that in one sample the virus was found by
electron microscope and no other Paramyxoviridae virus could be detected.
So we have a Paramyxoviridae virus-like particle which is not any of the
known Paramyxoviridae viruses. That is what we are looking at. Next steps
are more cell culture, and more particle trials perhaps in animals. In
essence, we are turning around information usually generated in months or
years within hours and days.
Q. I am not a medical expert, but once you have virus detected and
identified and determined, what do we do next? Where do we go from here?
A. Dr David Heymann: Let me try and explain. Once the cause is identified,
then a diagnostic test can be made. A test which may detect infection in
blood or other body secretions. Once this had been done we must use what we
call "Koch's postulate" to tell us if we have an organism, and we must be
clear that this organism is causing the disease. Then epidemiological
studies are needed to determine whether the disease is asymptomatic in some
people who have become sick or whether they are healthy and can be removed
from the list. There is a whole process of epidemiological investigations
after the virus is identified.
Q. Last time, WHO's overall assessment was that the outbreak was being
contained outside China, Hong Kong, and Viet Nam. What is your assessment
based on information now?
A. Dr Julie Hall: Figures of verified and confirmed cases are published on
the web every afternoon. There will be more figures this afternoon. I think
that what is clear is that the major areas of transmission of this disease
are in Hong Kong, Viet Nam and, obviously we have yet to see, China.
Hopefully we will have much more information next week. What we do know is
that cases that have occurred outside these countries have occurred in
hospital with no further spread of infection. What is very promising is
that heightened surveillance, early signs and symptoms, people can be taken
into protective hospital environment to prevent further transmission of
this disease.
The WHO Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network has 3 field teams
currently undertaking advanced epidemiological investigations. In Viet Nam,
WHO has a 9-person team, in Hong Kong 6 persons, and by the end of the
weekend we hope to have 5 people in Beijing. Institutions from the
following countries and people drawn from WHO and GOARN are represented in
these teams ­- New Zealand, USA, Japan, Australia, Sweden, Germany, France,
and the UK. These 3 field teams are working extremely hard to get as much
information as possible on what is happening in hospitals and in
communities. Where we have effective hospital infection control
transmission is dramatically reduced. And where patients are given good
supportive care, especially in intensive care units, a small number of
patients are stabilizing and may be discharged from hospital.
Q. You mentioned earlier that for the core cases of chlamydia identified by
the Chinese authorities, they did not believe that this was cause of
outbreak. Once the team is in China, do you expect that we will have a
clearer picture?
A. Dr David Heymann: What the Chinese have told us is that they identified
Chlamydia in core specimens and that these were preliminary results. They
have not yet determined what is causing the outbreak in China.
Q. We ask whether we have a community outbreak in Hong Kong, but the Hong
Kong authorities maintain that this is not the case.
A. Dr David Heymann: What we see is that initial cases are admitted to a
hospital. Those cases are then in close contact with health workers and it
is health workers who became infected first. So last Saturday, based on the
information from we had from Hong Kong and Viet Nam, more than 90 per cent
of all the cases were health workers, the other 10 per cent were index
cases, that is cases who were admitted to hospital with the disease before
health workers were infected or their family members had got infection.
What we are trying to prevent is the cases going from family members and
health workers to others who are not in the family. If that would occur, it
would be a community outbreak, that is, within the larger community than
health workers and their families.
Dr Guenael Rodier: When dealing with a community outbreak, it means that
the chain of transmission spreads rapidly and it is difficult to trace it
retrospectively. The question is who infected whom. In these cases, it was
easier because it always starts with a health care worker and the disease
is transmitted by close contact with the patient. We have a major pattern
of nosocomial or hospital acquired infection.
Dr Max Hardiman: The WHO travel advisory issued last Saturday was based on
a risk assessment and the quality of the cases being described and located
within hospitals. Other than health care workers and their families, there
is no transmission going on in communities to which travellers may become
exposed. That is why we have reviewed the new information and the WHO
advice stills stands: no restriction on travel is recommended.
Q. Given what has happened over the past 10 days, how would you rate the
international health communitys performance in coping this new and
mysterious disease?
A. Dr David Heymann: For the past 7 years we have been strengthening WHOs
ability to deal with infections that are of global and international
importance. We have done this through various measures that permit us now
to alert health facilities very rapidly. This is particularly important now
that diseases have potential to travel around the world, or where a disease
is naturally occurring without known cause or suspected of being
deliberately caused. We have learned many lessons in the past week and see
places where the links can be strengthened through our ministries of
health, between countries and within WHO to make the next event more easy
to manage. This is being undertaken within the context of the revision of
the International Health Regulations. We have seen that WHO can be
operational in this area. Through the global surveillance network, WHO has
prevented many additional cases of transmission.
Dr Guenael Rodier: This has been a good exercise in preparation. The global
community is responding very positively and seriously to this alert. This
real exercise shows that the system can work and that there is
justification for such a global alert, which will be a mechanism that
functions as the operational arm of the International Heath Regulations.
Q. You said there was room for improvement. Could you elaborate?
A. Dr David Heymann: We live in a world that is not only globalized but
inter-connected. We need to make that interconnection even stronger. This
will be part of the strengthening of the International Health Regulations
so that better channels of communication exist to communicate directly with
governments. We had several ways of communicating the global alert and we
chose the press to disseminate this information directly to governments. In
the future we can choose the press and electronic networks.
Dr Julie Hall: Through the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network WHO
is able to mount a response within 24 hours. The network consists of over
150 institutions around the world. Through the network, we have been able
to get personnel to go to the field, to get guidance and advice and to
gather protective equipment and other supplies within 24 hours. WHO was
able to mount an unprecedented response to this infection through the
global alert.
Q. What is the WHO global updated figure, including China, of suspected
cases and deaths? Last time I asked you whether you had given up on influenza.
A. Dr David Heymann: Influenza has not been isolated from any of the
patients in this outbreak. Therefore influenza as a working hypothesis has
been replaced by that of Paramyxoviridae virus. Influenza is very low on
our list of suspicion. Global figures as of today will be released at
16h00. [see part [1] above].
Q. Do I understand from what you have said that Paramyxoviridae virus may
be present in healthy people?
A. Dr David Heymann: The reason that we need to have a diagnostic test is
to be sure that Paramyxoviridae virus is not floating around in
asymptomatic people. We need to see if these people were exposed less
intensively than others who got a mild infection or did not show any
symptoms at all. Regarding China, there may have been a related outbreak in
the same geographical area and in same time period in Guangdong where 305
cases were found. Those cases were given to us by the Chinese government in
February [2003]. This will be verified as teams begin to work in China and
will be fully reported.

[In today's update there are now 350 reported suspected/confirmed cases of
SARS with 10 reported deaths; a case fatality rate of 2.9 per cent. Caution
must be used when interpreting these data as they refer to cases of SARS,
which is a clinically defined syndrome. Once a causative agent has been
definitively identified, these numbers may be subject to significant change
when there will be a defined "illness" which will be confirmable through
laboratory testing. As SARS is an acute severe respiratory syndrome it is
likely that once an agent is identified and laboratory testing for
confirmation of infection is available, other milder respiratory illness
presentations may be identified as part of the clinical spectrum of this
disease. In addition, it is possible that some of the cases currently
reported as SARS will be shown not to be due to the agent ultimately
identified and will remain as either suspected not laboratory confirmed, or
will be shown to be due to yet another agent not related to this current
outbreak.
We have included today's WHO press briefing in its entirety as it does an
excellent job of explaining the preliminary findings, the rationale behind
the cautions in early interpretation of laboratory findings as well as
important background on international health regulations and collaboration.
We at ProMED-mail have been impressed with investigation to date and the
speed at which so much information (epidemiologic and laboratory) has been
identified and disseminated on this new disease in such a short amount of
time. Very much a credit to the WHO Global Outbreak and Alert Network
including its partners around the world. - Mod.MPP]
[The statement by Dr Klaus Stohr that one of the laboratories reporting
identification of a paramyxovirus by electron microscopy has also been able
to propagate a virus in cell culture is very significant. If true, this may
allow rapid development of specific diagnostic reagents and facilitate
amplification and nucleotide sequencing of portions of the viral genome,
thereby determining the relationship of this putative etiologic agent of
SARS to known paramyxoviruses. However, at this stage it is by no means
certain that the paramyxovirus-like particles identified by electron
microscopy are indeed the etiologic agent of SARS. Paramyxoviruses are very
common viruses and are likely to be present in the upper respiratory tract
of many asymptomatic individuals. - Mod.CP]
