[Unfortunately, Armenia is now another country in the region where LSD occurs. Kapan, where the current outbreak was reported, is the largest town in southern Armenia located in the eastern part of the Province of Syunik, within the narrow valley of the Voghji river at the south eastern slopes of the Zangezur mountain range, between the Bargushat and Meghri ridges. The town is about 80 km (50 miles) north of the Iranian border https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapan.

In Turkey, Armenia's western neighbor, 236 LSD outbreaks had been reported prior to the disease being declared endemic (final report, 22 Jul 2014). The disease is suspected to have continued its circulation there since, spreading westwards and eastwards.

It will be interesting to obtain updated information from Georgia, neighboring both Turkey and Armenia.

For a general overview of the LSD situation in the area, please refer to the "disease outbreak maps" for the dates 1 May 2014 to 19 Jan 2016 at http://tinyurl.com/hp5e4d7. - Mods.CRD/AS
