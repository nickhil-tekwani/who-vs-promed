CWD-positive deer found in eastern Alberta
------------------------------------------
As part of its Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) Surveillance program,
Alberta Sustainable Resource Development have asked hunters to bring
in the heads of any deer they have shot. Researchers will then examine
for them for CWD.

As of 14 Jan 2009, more than 3000 heads have been tested in southern
and eastern Alberta and 6 have been found to have CWD. One positive
white tail deer was found as far south as Acadia Valley. The remaining
5 were found further north in the Wainright, Provost, and Lloydminster
areas.

According to Darcy Whiteside, Sustainable Resource Development
spokesman in Edmonton, the weather has hindered the amount of samples
scientists have been able to examine. "It's been a weird season. In
November, it was warm and there was no snow which hunters like to
have to track the animals," explained Whiteside who added, "but then
in December [2008] when we started to get snow it (got too cold to
hunt)." However, Whiteside said it's too early to declare this year's
program a success or a disappointment, due to the fact they need to
process all of their data.

Of the CWD-positive deer, 5 were in the wildlife management units
(WMU) northeast of Oyen while the other one was in the WMU by Acadia
Valley. In southeast Alberta, it was mandatory to submit the heads
from deer in the WMU areas east of Jenner, Redcliff, Cereal and
Consort. There were 24-hour freezers where hunters could take the
deer heads. They were located in Acadia Valley, Bow Island, Cereal,
Consort, Dunmore, Empress, Hilda, Jenner, Medicine Hat, Oyen,
Patricia and Redcliff. They were to be removed as of 15 Jan 2009
when hunting closed for the season.

Hunters who submitted deer heads should have been notified by mail
what the result was 4 to 6 weeks after the original drop-off time.
Those who had CWD-negative heads should have received a letter, while
those few who had a positive one should have already been telephoned.

CWD was identified as far back as the 1970s. It is only found in
deer-like animals (cervids) and does not effect cattle. Signs
include excessive salivation, lethargy, drooping head and ears. The
agent of CWD effects the nervous system and cause holes in the
animal's brain making it look like a sponge.

CWD seemed to make a strong appearance in the Oyen/Acadia
Valley/Empress area starting in 2005. On 2 Sep 2008 the Canadian Food
Inspection Agency (CFIA) discovered CWD in a mule deer doe found in a
farm yard 30 km [18.6 miles] southeast of Oyen.
