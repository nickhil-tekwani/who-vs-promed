Two more infants died of an intestinal viral epidemic sweeping Taiwan,
pushing the toll to 30, as U.S. experts arrived to help authorities find
the cause of the killer disease, reports said Sunday. The children, from
the central Taiwan county of Taichung, died of the virus in a hospital
Saturday. Doctors estimated the virus has infected at least 200,000 babies
around the island in the past week, newspapers and television reports said.
A team of experts from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
arrived late Saturday to help investigate the cause of the deadly
intestinal virus as health authorities came under fire for failing to
respond swiftly to curb the disease. "We are analyzing all the data. The
collection of examination examples is crucial to the understanding and
control of the virus," Hsieh Wen-ju, one of the U.S. scientists who arrived
in Taipei, told reporters. "Our major task here is to help build a better
epidemic prevention system," Hsieh said, adding that they needed to compile
data to form a comprehensive picture of the epidemic.
Hsieh was one of a team of scientists who went to Malaysia to help control
a similar enterovirus outbreak last year which killed more than 30 children
in the Southeast Asian country, the China Times Express said. The experts
are to stay in Taiwan for up to four weeks to complete data collection on
the illness that has attacked children below five years old. Parents of a
seven-month-old victim -- one of the two children who died Saturday -- have
agreed to have [an autopsy performed on their child to help doctors
investigate the virus, the Central Daily News said Sunday.
The arrival of the U.S. scientists followed stepped up measures including
the formation of a special epidemic task force ordered by Premier Vincent
Siew to disseminate information on the virus. Health officials, in an
effort to calm panicked parents, have said that patients often recovered
within a week "even without medication" but added that the virus could lead
to "possible complications." A Department of Health official told AFP that
parents have been warned not to bring their children to public places where
they can be exposed to the virus.
Health department director Chan Chi-hsien on Thursday conceded health
officials were slow to respond to the nationwide virus epidemic, as his
office came under increasing criticism. "The health department's epidemic
prevention agency has failed to come up with an effective and concrete
package to calm down panic-stricken parents and stop the spread of the
virus," the China Times said in an editorial. "Families and patients have
had to care for themselves without accurate information about the virus
from the epidemic control center. "This attitude ... is a negligence of
duty," the paper said.
Chan blamed the lack of coordination between the three health department
units -- the National Quarantine Service, the National Institute of
Preventative Medicine and the Bureau of Communicable Disease Control. The
health department had previously denied a cause-and-effect link between the
deaths and the virus, but local newspapers said 26 of the 30 victims were
killed by combinations spawned by the enterovirus type 71.
CDPC Note: Taiwan has capable public health epidemiologists, but the
present organization of their communicable disease units will continue to
make outbreak investigations and control difficult. ProMED-mail has
presented some interesting information on the treatment of illnesses
related to EV71. [see above archive sources

[Something seems quite odd in all this. Certainly CDC cannot be made to
appear responsible for not reporting information that rightly is to be
reported by the country submitting specimens. On the other hand, how long
must CDC or any other organization wait to release critical information?
First it was Malaysia, now Taiwan suffering from an epidemic of a serious
disease. It seems the two epidemics are related, even if only insofar as
the etiologic agent is concerned. Yet it is a year after the Malaysian
experience and we still do not have definitive information and the
Malaysian government seems to be quenching even the thought (by medical
personnel, researchers, and physicians) of questioning the official
government line. This is now too small a world for that sort of action.
I have some questions I am sure our readers would appreciate having
answered:
1. Did the children in Sarawak die from myocarditis? The deaths were all
very sudden and I understand there was no evidence of tissue inflammation
in two full post-mortem and nine heart biopsies. What then is the evidence
of myocarditis? Surely by now this key question should be answered, based
on clinical evidence, by the Malaysian Ministry of Health and CDC.
2. Several symposia were held, attended by senior pediatricians,
cardiologists, neurologists, pathologists, epidemiologists, virologists and
CDC experts. What was the outcome of those meetings? Myocarditis or
encephalomyelitis? Only when these questions are answered can we interpret
the laboratory findings.
3. A new adenovirus has been claimed to be causally related to the
myocarditis. Could the occurrence of that virus explain the CNS symptoms
and the brain stem lesions in two post-mortem findings by a Sarawak
pathologist and by CDC? Is this adenovirus a "red herring", present but
unrelated to the disease?
Seems to me that if the bureaucrats and politicians do not get out of the
way of this train they will be run over by it. Obfuscation will not serve
anyone. There are hundreds of thousands of people sick and tens of people
dead. Time to put all the cards on the table. - Mod.CHC
