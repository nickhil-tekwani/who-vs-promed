The latest issue of Eurosurveillance monthly
<http://www.b3e.jussieu.fr:80/ceses/eurosurv/> is devoted to meningococcal
disease, with reports from six member states of the European Union that
outline similarities and differences in trends over the past few years (1).
The annual incidence of meningococcal disease varies in these countries by
a factor of five, between 1 and 5 cases per 100,000 population. The
prevailing trend recently has been an increasing incidence of infections
caused by serogroup C strains of Neisseria meningitidis, but Belgium and
France have seen an increase in group B strains.
Data on bacterial meningitis from the United States published recently in
the New England Journal of Medicine come from a sentinel group of
laboratories in four states, representing a population of 10 million (2).
The incidence of meningococcal meningitis was 0.6 cases per 100,000
population in 1995, a fall of one third from the incidence of 0.9/100,000
in 1986, but the incidence of invasive meningococcal disease overall was
1.3/100,000 in 1986 and 1995. N. meningitidis of serogroup C predominated
in three of the sentinel states and serogroup Y in the fourth.
The tragedy of individual cases of meningococcal disease is multiplied
100-fold in Africa, where in the first three months of 1997 over 40,000
cases of meningitis (mainly serogroup A but unlikely to be tested) and
almost 4,500 deaths had been reported (3). Forty per cent of the cases
were from Burkina Faso, in west Africa, where a crude incidence for the
period was 186 cases per 100,000 population (16,775/9 million).
Contrasting levels of resources for immunisation against those strains of
N. meningitis for which vaccines are available (currently A and C)
[serotypes Y and W-135 are included in combined vaccines -Mod. ES are
illustrated by up to [20-fold differences between thresholds for their use
in different countries (1): 10 cases of group C disease in a population of
100,000 in a period of three months in the United States, compared with a
weekly incidence of 15/100,000 in sub-Saharan Africa.
