Medical authorities are reporting a fresh surge in deaths and infections of
the haemorrhagic Rift Valley fever in North Eastern Province (NEP) of Kenya
where it was first reported mid December last year [2006] before making a
westward spread into the country's southern and central regions last week.
After more than a month of ferocity in Northern Kenya where it killed 478
people and infected 33 00 [cattle and sheep?], RVF has now spread into
Kenya's central province and killed a patient who was admitted at the
Kenyatta National Hospital.
The new deaths in NEP exclude the national toll at 148 announced by the
Health Ministry on Wed [24 Jan 2007?] for they represent a week's figures
from remote areas that reached Garissa, the provincial capital, only on Thu
[25 Jan] and Fri [26].
Experts are blaming the new infections on a botched animal vaccination
exercise, fresh flooding and flouting of the ban on meat consumption
imposed last year. The Kenya government and several international agencies
commenced a vaccination exercise of 2 million animals i early Jan 2007, but
which has been fledgling [flagging?] due to lack of logistics and
coordination between departments. Due to lethargy within the police
department in Garissa, Tana River and Mwingi districts animal traders have
breached the ban on livestock trade and sold or slaughtered quarantined
animals, partly explaining the spread into Nairobi, the country's capital.
The new deaths and infections follow the recent withdrawal of a laboratory
brought to Garissa by the Centre for Disease Control-Kenya (CDC-Kenya) to
assist and speed diagnosis. It was taken away to Nairobi when RVF was
reported in cattle in Central Province.
Meanwhile, a couple [have been] admitted to the Nyeri Provincial General
hospital in critical condition exhibiting symptoms believed to be those of
Rift valley fever. The hospital's Superintendent Dr Victor Muiyembe said
the couple from Muiga location in Kieni East division complained of severe
headache, abdominal pain, and diarrhea with bloody stool. Speaking to KNA
at the hospital, Dr Muiyembe said the [pair] whose condition he described
as stable had fed on a cow's liver purchased from a local butchery.

[The practice of reporting case numbers and fatalities by province makes it
difficult to assess the magnitude of the outbreak in the human population,
other than that the disease still appears to be spreading. The relocation
of the Kenya CDC laboratory from Garissa to the capital Nairobi is an
additional complicating factor. - Mod.CP]
