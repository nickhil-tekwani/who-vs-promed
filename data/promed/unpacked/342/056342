Underdiagnosis of Dengue -- Laredo, Texas, 1999
-------------------------------------------------
Dengue outbreaks have been reported in communities along the Mexico/US
border since 1980; however, during the period from 1987 through July 1999,
no cases were reported from Laredo, Texas (1999 population: 162 000).
During January-July 1999, approximately 300-325 dengue cases were reported
from Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, Mexico (1999 population: 274 000), a city
across the Rio Grande from Laredo.
To determine whether undiagnosed or unreported dengue cases had occurred in
Laredo, the Texas Department of Health (TDH) reviewed medical records from
5 Laredo health facilities (the 2 city hospitals and the 3 largest of 5
community clinics). This report summarizes the findings of the review,
which indicated that during 23 Jul-20 Aug 1999, 50% of suspected
case-patients had undiagnosed dengue infection. Recognition of the
diagnosis of dengue can be improved through heightened surveillance,
professional and public education, and prompt reporting of cases by the
health care providers to local or state health departments.
[MMWR Editorial Note:
Dengue is an arboviral illness of tropical and subtropical areas commonly
transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes. Approximately 2.5 billion
persons live in regions where dengue is endemic and 50-100 million
infections occur annually. Although infection may result in lifelong
homotypic immunity, cross-protective immunity does not occur among the 4
dengue virus serotypes. Infection with any dengue serotype can be
asymptomatic or can cause dengue, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), or dengue
shock syndrome (DSS). DHF and DSS are life-threatening conditions. Since
the 1970s, outbreaks of dengue, DHF, and DSS have increased in frequency
and severity in the Americas and the Caribbean.
Dengue may present as an undifferentiated febrile illness and unless
physicians retain a high level of suspicion, a dengue diagnosis may be
missed easily in areas where the virus is not endemic. Laboratory testing
is necessary for diagnostic confirmation. Acute- and convalescent-phase
serum samples should be obtained for diagnosis and sent for confirmation to
state or territorial health department laboratories. Serum samples should
be accompanied by a summary of clinical and epidemiologic information,
including onset date, sample collection date, and a travel history for the
3 weeks before illness onset.
An estimated 2 million crossings occur each month between Laredo and Nuevo
Laredo, and _Ae. aegypti_ is found in both cities. Movement of infected
persons can introduce the virus into dengue-free areas. Travelers to
regions where dengue is endemic should avoid exposure to mosquito bites by
using repellents and protective clothing and by staying in well-screened or
air-conditioned quarters. Residents of areas where dengue is endemic and
Mexico/US border communities can reduce the _Ae. aegypti_ population in and
around homes by changing water in bird baths or flower vases daily, tightly
covering stored water receptacles, and eliminating old tires, containers,
tree holes, and other potential mosquito breeding sites.
Following identification of dengue cases, the Laredo Health Department
implemented mosquito reduction activities (e.g., aggressive refuse and tire
disposal campaigns and insecticide fogging). Dengue alerts were sent to
healthcare providers, and mosquito reduction and personal protection
information was distributed through health fairs and schools. Information
exchange increased substantially between health officials from Laredo and
Nuevo Laredo. Although no suspected cases were reported before the alerts
were issued, a total of 161 suspected dengue cases [were reported during
mid-August-December 1999; 18 cases tested positive for dengue. No positive
cases were reported from Laredo in 2000. When a case of dengue is confirmed
in a community, the public health response should include education of
health care providers and the public, intensified surveillance, and
enhanced vector control activities. Additional information about dengue is
