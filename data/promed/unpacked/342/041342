The more transmissible omicron BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants are now dominant in all parts of the United States, with BA.5 again steadily expanding its scope, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said today [5 Jul 2022] in its latest weekly estimates (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions).

Combined, the 2 subvariants make up more than 70% of recently sequenced samples, up sharply from 52.3% the previous week. Of the variants CDC is tracking, BA.5 now makes up 53.6%, and BA.4 makes up 16.5%. The proportion of BA.2.12.1 -- first detected in New York -- continues to decline.

South-central states were the first to see BA.4 and BA.5 become dominant. The 2 subvariants are more transmissible and have mutations linked to immune escape.

Last week the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended that vaccine companies update their booster shots to include BA.4 and BA.5, which is fueling increased cases in many countries. Hospitalizations are rising as the volume of cases picks up, but so far, there's no sign that illnesses involving the subvariants are more severe (https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/06/news-scan-jun-30-2022).

The updated boosters are expected to be available in early to mid fall [2022], but in recent vaccine advisory group meetings, experts aired concerns about the possibility that more variants will emerge by that time.

Currently, cases in the United States have been holding steady since late May [2022] at an elevated level. The 7-day average for daily new cases is 105 745, with daily deaths averaging 389, according to The New York Times tracker (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html). It's unclear how the 4th of July holiday gatherings will affect COVID-19 spread, but in 2021 a notable delta variant surge began in July.

Over the holiday weekend, US airports saw their biggest crowds since the pandemic began, with about 2.49 million passengers going through checkpoints, according to the Associated Press (https://apnews.com/article/travel-leisure-transportation-bee6fab05daf916683727e3879668cb2).

Globally, countries continue to battle new surges, with cases in Romania nearly doubling over the past week, according to Reuters (https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/romania-covid-cases-nearly-double-week-2022-07-04/).

In China, officials have closed schools and businesses in the Shaanxi province city of Xi'an, with a population of about 13 million, for a week after a cluster of cases were detected, according to Agence France-Presse (https://medicalxpress.com/news/2022-07-chinese-city-million-covid-explosion.html). Also, cases are rising in the Anhui province city of Suzhou, prompting control measures. And in Shanghai, officials ordered more rounds of mass testing following a cluster of cases linked to a karaoke bar.

In other global developments, virologists are closely watching another omicron variant called BA.2.75 that appears to be competing with BA.5 in India. So far, BA.2.75 hasn't been designated as a variant of interest or a variant of concern.

Ulrich Elling, PhD, with Australia's Institute of Molecular Biotechnology, said on Twitter that there are few confirmed cases from sequenced samples. Most are from India, but the virus has already been found in Australia, Canada, Germany, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. He said it's too soon to know if BA.2.75 will take over from BA.2 or make headway on BA.5, but he raised concerns about immune escape, based on mutations.

Last week, Tom Peacock, PhD, a virologist at Imperial College London, urged surveillance experts to keep a close eye on BA.2.75 owing to several spike mutations, its likelihood as a 2nd-generation variant, apparent rapid growth, and wide geographic spread.

[2] COVID news
[A] COVID-related croup amid omicron
Date: Tue 5 Jul 2022

A new study shows that the proportion of children diagnosed as having COVID-19 and croup was significantly higher during the omicron surge than in earlier waves dominated by other variants. Croup is an upper airway infection generally affecting children. It causes swelling around the larynx, trachea, and bronchi, resulting in labored breathing and a "barking" cough.

Late last week [1 Jul 2022] in JAMA Network Open, researchers from Children's Minnesota reported on their study of 5152 children aged 3 months to 8 years diagnosed as having croup related to COVID-19 from 1 Jan 2021 to 26 Mar 2022 (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2793808). The team used data from 43 US children's hospitals in the Pediatric Health Information System. Median patient age was 17 months, and 64.6% were boys.

The proportion of children with both infections was 10.9% in the omicron era, up from 4.1% amid alpha and other variants and 3.6% during delta. The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of hospitalization for infections caused by alpha or other variants was 1.28 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97-1.70), while it was 0.92 (95% CI, 0.74-1.15) during delta -- figures not significantly different from that of the omicron period.

Racemic epinephrine (RE) to reduce swelling was used less often during the delta era (aOR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.61-0.87) and didn't differ in periods dominated by alpha or other variants (aOR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.81-1.31) relative to the omicron era, suggesting lower disease severity during delta. Admissions to an intensive care unit (ICU) were similar across the time periods.

The authors noted that the overall ICU admission was lower than a rate reported before COVID-19, which they said could be related to limitations on ICU capacity or less-severe illness.

"Given that COVID-19 is likely to become endemic, our findings suggest that pediatric health systems should consider variation in SARS-CoV-2 phenotypes and their association with patient care," they concluded. "This may be especially true when other viral infections lead to surges in patient volume."

[B] Convalescent plasma for COVID-19
Date: Tue 5 Jul 2022

Though widely given to severely ill patients hospitalized with COVID-19 during the pandemic, convalescent plasma did not improve the ability to survive or recover, according to a national clinical trial published today [5 Jul 2022] in Chest (https://journal.chestnet.org/article/S0012-3692(22)01201-6/pdf).

The study was led by researchers at Vanderbilt University, and it looked at the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 convalescent plasma therapy for adults hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19 within 2 weeks of symptom onset. The study enrolled 960 patients from 25 US hospitals who were administered plasma from someone who had survived COVID (482 patients) or a placebo (465 patients).

The goal of convalescent plasma use is for the patient to receive passive SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The 2 groups, however, saw little difference in outcome: At 28 days following treatment, 18.5% of patients in the convalescent plasma group and 17.2% of patients in the placebo group had died. The researchers also found that clinical status by day 14 of illness did not differ between the groups, nor did any of the 13 secondary efficacy outcomes that they measured.

"Providing passive immunity with convalescent plasma does not appear to benefit patients once their illness has progressed to the point of needing treatment in the hospital," said Todd Rice, MD, a senior author of the study, in a Vanderbilt press release (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/957871). "Despite receiving convalescent plasma with a higher titer of neutralizing antibodies, the therapy did not help hospitalized patients."

[More from the Vanderbilt University press release (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/957871): "The rationale for using convalescent plasma for acute viral infections like COVID-19 has been that transfusing the plasma component of blood from a patient who has recently recovered from the same disease to a patient early in the stage of infection might provide the currently infected patient with antibodies against the infecting virus, helping them recover more quickly."

"Self (the study's 1st author) said although the VUMC study is the most well-controlled trial of COVID-19 convalescent plasma in hospitalized patients, other studies have been conducted over the past couple of years showing similar results -- that convalescent plasma as a therapy for those hospitalized with COVID-19, at least as currently deployed, doesn't work. 'It's solid evidence,' he said."]
