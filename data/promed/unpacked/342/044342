The Virginia Department of Health has confirmed a 2nd death connected to
the recent investigation of 2 possible botulism cases. A 75 year old
retired anesthesiologist, who lived in Roanoke County, was diagnosed with
botulism and died on Fri 16 Nov 2007. The death of his wife, a 57 year old
female physician, on 12 November 2007 was said to be "related to botulism
poisoning" [see: Botulism, human - USA: (VA), RFI 20071114.3700].
Authorities have not said if botulism was responsible for the 1st death or
connected to the 2nd, unconfirmed, case.

Local health officials have said that with the recent proliferation of
public health emergencies in the Roanoke area, there was less attention
paid to informing the public about the causes and dangers of botulism.

Robert Parker, a regional spokesman for the health department, said the
department has not treated the reported botulism cases as a public health
emergency because it believes that the incidents were isolated and related
to the home canning of food. "The people that need to be in conversation
are in conversation," Parker said. "Generally, though, this doesn't change
the fact that botulism is a rare illness. It can be serious, but it's
generally rare, there is nothing that has happened recently that changes
that assessment."

[In ProMED's original posting, this moderator interpreted what was written
to say that there were 2 cases in addition to this couple. It now appears
that there may be only these 2 cases, both fatal, which seem to be related
to home canning. No additional information regarding the suspected vehicle
and type of botulinum toxin involved is available at this time.
