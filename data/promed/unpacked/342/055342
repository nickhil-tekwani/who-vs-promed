Protecting animals from the diseases that affect their species and related ones is a herculean task in itself. Imagine having to worry about sicknesses that originate in canines ravaging felines? According to scientists, that is exactly the scenario that Siberian tigers, also known as Amur tigers (_Panthera tigris altaica_), are being challenged within Far Eastern Russia, and that vaccination is the only viable approach to protect them.

A new study [see reference below] has stated that the Siberian tiger is facing a major threat from Canine distemper virus (CDV) that leads to serious illness in domestic dogs (_Canis familiaris_), and can also infect other carnivores. While domestic dogs are believed to be the primary source of the potent virus, the research found that other endemic wildlife has been serving as the principal source of CDV that is threatening an already endangered species of big cats with extinction.

"Understanding how tigers are catching distemper is absolutely crucial to helping us design effective measures to minimize the conservation impact of the virus," said Dr Martin Gilbert, lead author of a study, in a statement.

Canine distemper, the disease caused by CDV, is highly contagious and causes a wide range of complications in the infected animal. According to the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), the disease critically affects the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and nervous systems of domestic dogs.

However, other related species such as coyotes, wolves, foxes, and jackals, along with animals such as minks, raccoons, and ferrets, can also be infected by the virus. The disease has also been found in big cats such as leopards, lions, tigers and other wild cats.

Though it was initially believed that the disease could not cross over to felines, a CDV outbreak among captive big cats in California in the 1980s confirmed that it was a cause for concern. The fears were further amplified in 1994 when lions in the Serengeti Reserve in Tanzania were devastated by a massive outbreak, and nearly 1000 of them succumbed to it.

The authors agreed that vaccination was the only feasible measure to tackle the problem. However, they stressed that it was the tigers themselves that had to be inoculated using injectable vaccines and not the local dogs. To ascertain whether existing CDV vaccines could offer wild tigers protection, the team tested serum procured from captive tigers that had been vaccinated with CDV vaccines. Surprisingly, the strain of CDV that had been identified in Russia was effectively neutralized.

Nevertheless, the researchers were faced with a practical hurdle -- How can an abundant big cat population be vaccinated? The absence of an oral CDV vaccine makes the distribution of vaccines to such a large population via baited food impossible. To mitigate this, the scientists developed a computer model that demonstrated that even a low rate of vaccination (2 tigers per year) had the potential to decrease the threat of extinction among these tigers remarkably (almost 75 percent).

If strategized smartly, the entire exercise could cost only USD 30 000 per year or lesser if the tigers are vaccinated when they are captured for regular radio-collaring studies. "This work shows that CDV in the Amur tiger is a solvable problem -- a rare piece of good news for the tiger conservation community," concluded Dr Sarah Cleaveland, co-author of the study.

The pathogen flow at the carnivore wildlife-domestic interface is a major conservation concern, especially where feral dogs are abundant. Documentation of outbreaks in wild carnivores due to exposure to cat and dog pathogens abound throughout the world. There have been reports of wild tigers dying due to CDV [canine distemper virus] infection in Russia. This new information adds further concern as native carnivores seem to be playing a role in maintaining CDV in the absence of dogs.

It is important to consider that canine distemper is not the only pathogen that domestic and wild carnivores can transmit to tigers.

Developing a vaccine to be used in Amur tigers can be a powerful tool to avoid extinction. The modeling work presented shows that it might prove successful. It should be taken into account, however, that CDV is not a transient problem, so in parallel non-vaccinated tigers should be monitored to evaluate the evolution of resistance or tolerance, or otherwise, they will be dependent on vaccination ad eternum. - Mod.PMB
