A study was conducted in 7 Colombian cities and 19 hospitals tracking
15 333 newborns. What surprised the researchers who performed the
Colombian National Study on Congenital Toxoplasmosis were the
significant differences in infection rates among the studied cities.

While in Florencia (Caqueta) and Armenia (Quindio), 3 to 6 of every
100 live births [showed serological markers of infection (specific
anti-Toxoplasma IgM or IgA antibodies) in the cord blood], in Bogota,
Barranquilla and Bucaramanga, this proportion decreased to one of 100
live births. In places like Riohacha or Cucuta, less than 7 of every
1000 are infected.

The research team, headed by Jorge Enrique Gomez Marin of Universidad
del Quindio, looked at more than 10 variables to find an answer; among
others, socioeconomic status, level of the reference hospital where
the child was treated, geographical variables, altitude and
temperature, and type of health coverage of the patients. In the end,
only one variable proved to be related to the incidence of the
disease: increased levels of rainfall.

"When it rains, you can expect an increase in the number of cases of
toxoplasmosis because water carries infectious material into rivers
and eventually to the aqueducts," says Gomez. The "oocyst" stage of
the parasite can remain in the soil for up to one year without losing
its infectivity.

This study was published in the journal PLoS (Neglected Tropical
Diseases), and the results will be presented at the Colombian Congress
of Infectious Diseases to be held next week in Medellin. It
demonstrated further that 25 percent of the _Toxoplasma_-infected
newborns in Colombia who are not diagnosed, and therefore receive no
anti-parasitic treatment, ultimately die as a consequence of this
infection.

"Toxoplasmosis is the 2nd cause of congenital blindness. It is a
disease that has a very important impact on children's health," said
Gomez. Hence, he insisted on the need for diagnostic testing on all
pregnant women. One problem facing the country is that the EPS [Health
Provider Institutions] only authorize a diagnostic test during the 1st
3 months of pregnancy, whereas the infection may occur at any month.

[The study referred to is: Gomez-Marin JE et al. First Colombian
multicentric newborn screening for congenital toxoplasmosis. PLoS Negl
Trop Dis. 2011;5(5):e1195. Epub 31 May 2011. The study is important
because it brings attention to waterborne infection. Waterborne
outbreaks have been described from contaminated water reservoirs
(Canada, Brazil, India), but only one previous study -- from Brazil --
has clearly shown that the use of surface water for consumption is a
risk factor for being Toxoplasma IgG-seropositive (Bahia-Oliveira LM
et al. Highly endemic, waterborne toxoplasmosis in north Rio de
Janeiro state, Brazil. Emerg Infect Dis. 2003;9:55-62). The link
between precipitation and toxoplasmosis shows that either the piped
water is not properly filtered or the consumption of surface water is
common.
