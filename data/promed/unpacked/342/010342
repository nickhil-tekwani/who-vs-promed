[1] WHO global update

Influenza update - 322 (based on data up to 5 Aug 2018)
-------------------------------------------------------
Information in this report is categorized by influenza transmission zones, which are geographical groups of countries, areas, or territories with similar influenza transmission patterns.

Summary
-------
In the temperate zones of the southern hemisphere, influenza activity remained elevated in South America and continued to decrease in Southern Africa. Influenza activity remained below seasonal threshold in Australia and New Zealand and at inter-seasonal levels in most of temperate zone of the northern hemisphere. Reports of influenza activity were reported as decreased in some countries of tropical America. Worldwide, seasonal influenza subtype A viruses accounted for the majority of detections.

National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 67 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from 23 Jul 2018 to 5 Aug 2018 (data as of 17 Aug 2018 03:34:24 UTC). The WHO GISRS [Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System] laboratories tested more than 42 056 specimens during that time period. 916 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 799 (87.2 percent) were typed as influenza A and 117 (12.8 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 535 (79.6 percent) were influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 and 137 (20.4 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 39 (72.2 percent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 15 (27.8 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the 7th report of the 2017-18 influenza season.
As of week 30/2018 [22-28 Jul 2018], over 239 000 influenza detections across the WHO European Region have been reported. 44 percent of the detected viruses were type A, with A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses being detected in equal numbers. Type B viruses accounted for 56 percent; B/Yamagata viruses prevailed over B/Victoria viruses at a ratio of over 50:1.

[3] Review of the 2017-2018 influenza season in the northern hemisphere
Date: Tue 24 Aug 2018

This report summarizes the chronology, epidemiology, and virology of the 2017-2018 influenza season in the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is based on data on influenza activity collected between October 2017 and mid-May 2018. The data presented were derived primarily from reports published by national ministries of health or other official bodies or reported to WHO through FluNet or FluID. Transmission characteristics, illness and mortality data are presented by geographical region: North America, Europe, northern Africa, and western Asia and eastern Asia ...[more]

Human influenza transmission usually occurs in the winter months in the northern hemisphere temperate region, but the exact timing and duration of the influenza season varies by country and by year. The influenza season can begin as early as October, but usually peaks around January or February. For the purposes of this report, the peak of influenza activity is the month or week in which the highest percentage of respiratory specimens test positive for influenza viruses, and influenza activity is based on the positivity rate for influenza unless otherwise specified. Information on antigenic characterization, genetic testing and antiviral susceptibility is given when available from reports published by national ministries of health or other official bodies and can be found online in the archive of WHO recommendations on the composition of influenza virus vaccines ...[more]
