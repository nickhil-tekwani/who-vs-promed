The strain from this patient has been sequenced and been shown to be
Angolan in origin. The Angolan strains were in turn shown to be Indian in
origin.

Poliomyelitis in Namibia - 7 Jun 2006
-------------------------------------------
Thirty-four suspect cases with sudden paralysis are under investigation,
mostly in the Windhoek area of Namibia, of which 3 have been confirmed as
wild poliovirus. What is thought to be the 1st case is a 39-year old man
with onset of paralysis on 8 May [2006], later confirmed as infected with
wild poliovirus type-1. The majority of suspect cases are over 20 years
old; 7 of the individuals have died.
National health authorities are planning a response to an outbreak of wild
poliovirus in Namibia, polio-free since 1996. An investigation of the
outbreak -- which unusually appears to be affecting mostly adults -- is
currently under way. Genetic sequencing confirms that the virus is
consistent with an importation from Angola, of Indian origin. Angola,
polio-free since 2001, was re-infected last year [2005] by a virus from India.
The government is planning an immunization response consisting of 3
National Immunization Days (NIDs), using monovalent oral polio vaccine type
1 (mOPV1). The 1st NID could be conducted as early as 21 Jun [2006] and
will aim to reach the entire population of the country (2 million) rather
than the usual under-5-years population. The age of any further cases will
dictate the target age groups for the 2 subsequent NIDs. An international
team is in the country to assist the national authorities.
Namibia began routine immunization for polio in 1990. While the cause of
the largely adult outbreak is yet to be determined, it is likely that those
who fell ill did not receive immunization as children. Routine immunization
coverage within Namibia today varies by region from 60 percent to 80 percent.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. Lucille Blumberg for sending
information on the genetic profile of the wild poliovirus (WPV) isolate
associated with the outbreak in Namibia. As mentioned, the virus identified
is similar to that seen in Angola in 2005 (see ProMED postings listed
below), with an original origin in India. Looking at a map of Africa
(<http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/africa.pdf>),
Angola directly borders Namibia to the north, where there is most likely to
be human traffic between the neighboring countries thereby providing the
means of transportation of the WPV across the border.
As noted in the previous ProMED-mail posting (see Poliomyelitis - worldwide
(08): Namibia, conf. 20060606.1576) and mentioned in the WHO update above,
the majority of the cases in this outbreak are in older age groups, hence
the decision to include the entire population in the 1st round of the
planned National Immunization Day (NID) is a prudent measure. As a
reminder, the last outbreaks of polio in the Netherlands and in the USA
have involved a large proportion of adult cases as well, related to large
pools of adult susceptibles (in both cases associated with populations that
refused vaccination due to religious objections). These populations were
living in countries where they were surrounded by vaccinated individuals
providing herd immunity through the years until the WPV was "lucky" enough
to find entry into those pockets of susceptibles. Hopefully, in the case of
Namibia, the response to the NID campaign will be high, permitting an
interruption of transmission of the WPV.
ProMED-mail would also like to thank Pablo Nart and George Robertson for
submitting newswires containing similar information as posted above.
