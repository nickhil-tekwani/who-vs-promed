China: new human bird flu case confirmed
----------------------------------------
China on Wednesday [28 Feb 2007] confirmed a human case of bird flu, the
country's 1st for 7 weeks, the Hong Kong government's media service reported.
The patient is a 44 year old female farmer from Fujian province who
developed fever and coughing 10 days ago, a spokesman for China's
Department of Health was quoted by Hong Kong's Government Information
Service (GIS) as saying. Laboratory tests on the patient by the China
Centre for Disease Control and Prevention yielded a positive result for the
H5N1 strain of bird flu, GIS reported the spokesman saying.
The latest case brings to 23 the number of people in China who have
contracted the H5N1 strain since it emerged in Asia in late 2003 and spread
globally. Bird flu has killed more than 167 people worldwide since then,
and fears remain that it could trigger a deadly, global pandemic if a
strain evolves that transmits easily from human to human.
