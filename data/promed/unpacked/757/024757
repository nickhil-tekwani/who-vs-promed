A Myanmar illegal immigrant from the Juru detention centre [in Bukit
Mertajam, Penang] died of leptospirosis at Bukit Mertajam Hospital on
Tuesday [12 May 2009]. As of noon yesterday [15 May 2009], 26 cases
were reported -- 24 cases are being treated at Bukit Mertajam
Hospital and 2 at Seberang Jaya Hospital [also in Penang]. All
affected were detainees at the centre.

The 21-year-old Myanmar [national] died after being treated at the
hospital's intensive care unit for suspected leptospirosis since his
admission on [7 May 2009]. He showed symptoms of pedal oedema (fluid
accumulation in the leg), fever, decreased urine output,
constipation, and lethargy. Three cases with similar symptoms were
also reported on Tuesday [12 May 2009] and upon further
investigations by the state health department and Seberang Perai
Tengah district health office, more cases were identified and
referred to Bukit Mertajam Hospital.

The department said samples from the camp's water supply had been
taken for checks on contamination, and that its health teams were
visiting the camp daily to monitor the inmates for similar symptoms.
Disinfection had also been carried out at the detention camp's
blocks, toilets, and bathrooms. It is believed that the outbreak of
the disease was caused by rat urine. Sources said initial
investigations revealed that bacteria similar to that found in rat
urine was found in the fresh water sample taken from the camp. The
source, however, said the situation was under control.

Checks at the detention depot yesterday [15 May 2009] showed that the
compound was placed on high security. Personnel manning the entrance
said they received instructions to bar visitors who did not have the
immigration department's permission to enter the camp. State
immigration department officials could not be reached for comment.

Leptospirosis, which is also known as Weil's disease or syndrome,
canicola fever, or Fort Bragg fever, is a rare and severe contagious
bacterial infection that affects humans and a wide range of animals.
The infection is commonly transmitted to humans by allowing animal
urine-contaminated water to come in contact with unhealed breaks in
the skin, eyes, or the mucous membranes.

Thirteen illegal immigrants from the Juru detention center who were
suspected down with leptospirosis and admitted to the Bukit Mertajam
Hospital [Penang], have been discharged, health Director-General Tan
Sri Dr Ismail Merican. In a statement issued today [17 May 2009], he
said there were among 37 people from the center who were admitted for
treatment for the disease.

He said the 23 people who were still at hospitals for treatment
included 22 at the Bukit Mertajam Hospital, with one in critical
condition at the intensive care unit and 22 others in the isolation
ward at the hospital. The other patient is in the intensive care unit
of the Seberang Jaya Hospital and whose condition is reported to be
stable, he added.

Dr Ismail said steps were being taken to contain the spread of the
disease, including disinfecting the buildings at the center,
conducting surveillance and daily checks on inmates, and referring
those with symptoms of the disease to the nearest hospital.

Meanwhile, Penang immigration director Abdul Rahman Harun said the 23
illegal immigrants who were still at the hospital comprised 19
Myanmar nationals and 4 Bangladeshi, with the youngest aged 17, and
the oldest at 45. The Immigration Department had informed the Myanmar
ambassador and the Bangladeshi High Commission of the matter and
their representatives were expected to visit the center next week, he added.

He also said that the cause of death of a Myanmar detainee at the
center on [12 May 2009] had yet to be ascertained.

Abdul Rahman also advised residents staying near the Juru detention
center not to panic or be alarmed because the disease, which affected
inmates at the center was under control and that steps were taken by
the department to contain the disease. There are 552 illegal
immigrants at the center, comprising 478 men, 72 women, and 2 children.

Leptospirosis, which is also known as Weil's disease or syndrome,
canicola fever, or Fort Bragg fever, is commonly transmitted to
humans by allowing water contaminated by animal urine like rats or
squirrels to come into contact with unhealed breaks in the skin,
eyes, or the mucous membrane.

[This spirochetal, zoonotic disease is generally spread from the
urine of chronically infected animals to humans through percutaneous
or mucous membrane penetration by one of many pathogenic serotypes of
the spirochete _Leptospira_ following exposure to water contaminated
with infectious urine. Often rats, but domesticated animals, such as
dogs, may be implicated. Inadequate disposal of trash and debris can
provide a suitable habitat for rat infestation in urban settings.
Because the clinical manifestations of leptospirosis can overlap
those of other infectious diseases, laboratory confirmation of the
diagnosis is necessary.
