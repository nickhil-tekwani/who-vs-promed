Embrex, Inc. and Fort Dodge Animal Health (FDAH), a division of
American Home Products today jointly announced that Bursamune(TM),
an infectious bursal disease (IBD) vaccine, has received marketing
approval from Ministerio de Agricultura, Pesca y Alimentacion,
Direccion General de Ganaderia in Spain for _in ovo_ (in the egg)
administration to broiler chickens. It will be marketed in Spain by
FDAH in May [1999.
Embrex announced it has received special permission from the Ministry
of Agriculture in the People's Republic of China to import and sell
30 million doses of Bursaplex(R), a similar Embrex vaccine available
in a number of countries in the Americas and Asia. Full regulatory approval
of Bursaplex(R) in China is anticipated later in 1999.
Bursamune(TM) and Bursaplex(R) both combine strains of the IBD virus
with Embrex's proprietary Viral Neutralizing Factor (VNF(R)), an antibody
that renders virulent vaccines safe. These products provide protection
against IBD in a single dose, reducing or eliminating many of the multiple
booster vaccinations commonly used by poultry producers when they
deliver post- hatch IBD vaccines.
IBD is a highly contagious immune system disease which, if left untreated,
can destroy entire flocks and spread.
Randall L. Marcuson, president and chief executive officer of Embrex said,
"Among the top 10 producing countries, Spain was an early adopter of
_in ovo_ delivery of Marek's vaccine in Europe. Likewise, China is important
since it is the world's second largest poultry producer."
