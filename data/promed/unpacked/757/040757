Outbreak 1 -- 9 cases, 4 deaths; ST37
Outbreak 2 -- 12 cases (2 in 2020, 9 in 2021 and 1 in 2022, all same strain), 3 deaths; ST11
Outbreak 3 -- 7 cases (1 case in 2021, 2 in April, 1 in May, and 3 in June 2022), 1 death; ST8

Officials in Denmark are investigating 3 separate _Listeria monocytogenes_ outbreaks that have affected almost 30 people, with 8 deaths reported. The Statens Serum Institut, Danish Veterinary and Food Administration (Fødevarestyrelsen) and DTU Food Institute are trying to find the sources of these outbreaks.

Speaking earlier in June [2022], Nikolas Hove from Fødevarestyrelsen said it was rare to see so many listeria infections in such a short period and officials were working to find out which foods were the cause of illness, so the outbreak could be stopped.

Fødevarestyrelsen has written to a number of large industry organizations calling for their members to sharpen in-house monitoring of listeria. If they find the bacterium in the environment or products, they can have it typed for free at Fødevarestyrelsen's laboratory.

The Statens Serum Institut is responsible for sequencing isolates from patients and interviewing them or their relatives to identify the possible sources of infection. Denmark usually sees an average of 4 listeriosis cases per month.

Outbreak 1
This had already been reported, but the Statens Serum Institut has updated the number of people sick. This incident has affected 9 people, all of them have been hospitalized and 4 have died; 5 cases are men and 4 women. Patients range from 33 to 93 years old, and all had an underlying disease or other immune system issue prior to infection that made them particularly vulnerable, such as meningitis or sepsis. Eight are from the Hovedstaden region of the country. Sample dates range from 13 May to 6 Jun 2022. Whole genome sequencing found the strains were closely related and of the sequence type (ST) 37.

Outbreak 2
In the 2nd outbreak, 12 people have been infected with the same type of listeria since October 2020; 2 cases were reported in 2020, 9 in 2021 and 1 in 2022. Patients are 7 men and 5 women over the age of 70 and they live across the country; 3 people in the outbreak have died and all were hospitalized. Whole genome sequencing of bacteria isolated from sick people found they were closely related and of the ST11.

Outbreak 3
In the 3rd outbreak, 7 people have been infected with the same type of listeria since October 2021. One case was recorded in 2021, and there have been 2 in April, 1 in May and 3 in June 2022. Those sick are 4 men and 3 women over the age of 50 and they live throughout the country; one person has died and all sick people were hospitalized. Whole genome sequencing has been used in the outbreak involving isolates from patients with ST8.

The Statens Serum Institut has asked if other countries have matching listeria cases through the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) network, but as yet no countries have replied saying they have infections with the same outbreak strains.

[The 1st outbreak mentioned in the news report above was reported in a previous ProMED post (Listeriosis - Denmark: fatal, WGS, RFI 20220610.8703790), which involved 8 people infected by a closely related listeria strain by whole genome sequencing (WGS), having ST37, which implies a common, but as yet unidentified, source. The other 2 outbreaks mentioned in the news report above are each caused by strains of listeria having unique, but different, genotypes; one is ST11 and the other ST8, implying each outbreak is caused by different, as yet unidentified, source.

We are not told whether food histories from these patients suggested a source or if WGS that was performed on listeria isolated from any particular food item yielded a similar genotype. Listeriosis has a long incubation period (up to 70 days), additional cases associated with the outbreak strains may yet appear. More information on these outbreaks would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

In the United States, as in Europe, a similar system identifies clusters of possibly related cases based on WGS of clinical isolates of _Listeria monocytogenes_, usually from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, tissue from a normally sterile site, or products of conception (such as amniotic fluid, placental, or fetal tissue). In the United States, clinical isolates are forwarded to state public health laboratories for genotyping, the results of which are then submitted to PulseNet, the National Molecular Subtyping Network for Foodborne Disease Surveillance (https://www.cdc.gov/pulsenet/outbreak-detection/index.html). When PulseNet identifies a cluster of _L. monocytogenes_ patient isolates having the same molecular pattern, epidemiologists look at food exposures reported on the Listeria Case Report from patients in the cluster to identify a possible common source.

Once a cluster is identified, PulseNet works with other federal food regulatory agencies -- the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA/FSIS) -- to find isolates found in food monitoring programs that have similar genotypes, which would implicate them as a common source.

_Listeria monocytogenes_, the cause of listeriosis, is widely distributed in nature. The organism is a Gram positive bacillus that can be found in soil, water, silage, raw vegetables, raw meat, and poultry, raw (unpasteurized) milk, soft cheeses, kitchen premises used to process contaminated meat or fish and vegetables, and in the intestinal tract of many animals, including cattle, sheep, humans, crustaceans, fish, shellfish, ticks, and insects. Most human infections are foodborne, although vertical transmission can occur from mother to fetus transplacentally or during delivery through an infected birth canal, and localized skin infections can occur in veterinarians and farmers by direct contact with infected animals.

_L. monocytogenes_ can form biofilms, which enable the organism to attach to solid surfaces and become extremely difficult to remove, especially in parts of food-processing equipment that may be difficult to access.

Listeria-contaminated, refrigerated, ready-to-eat products (that is, products that do not require further cooking before eating, such as smoked fish or cold-cut meats like ham or pork) are well-recognized sources of listeriosis because listeria is able to multiply at refrigerator temperatures. Refrigeration allows small numbers of listeria that contaminate food at the source to grow to sufficient size to cause disease. Unpasteurized milk and cheese and other milk products made from unpasteurized milk, as well as milk and milk products contaminated with listeria only after pasteurization, are other sources of listeriosis.

Patients in the 1st listeriosis outbreak reside in Hovedstaden, the Capital Region of Denmark, which is the easternmost region of Denmark; the Capital Region has 29 municipalities, including the capital city, Copenhagen (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_Region_of_Denmark).
