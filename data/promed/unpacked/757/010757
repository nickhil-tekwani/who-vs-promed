Cambodia: Avian Influenza Situation - WHO update
-------------------------------------------
As of Thu 6 Apr 2006, the Ministry of Health in Cambodia has confirmed the
country's 6th case of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus.
The case occurred in a 12-year-old boy from the southeastern province of
Prey Veng, which borders Viet Nam.
The boy developed symptoms of fever and headache on 29 Mar 2006. He was
initially treated at a private clinic, then hospitalized in Phnom Penh on 4
Apr 2006. He died on Wed 5 Apr 2006. Samples from the boy tested positive
for H5N1 infection at the Pasteur Institute in Cambodia.
A team from the Ministry of Health, WHO, and the Pasteur Institute
investigated the situation in the child's village yesterday. Numerous
chicken deaths and some duck deaths were noted in the neighbourhood in
recent weeks. The child reportedly gathered dead chickens for distribution
to village families for consumption.
The investigative team identified 25 close contacts of the child. None of
these people show signs of illness at present. House-to-house surveillance
for signs of influenza-like illness is continuing.
This case is the 6th in Cambodia and the 2nd this year. All 6 cases were fatal.

Egypt: Avian Influenza Situation - WHO Update 3
-----------------------------------------------
As of Thu 6 Apr 2006, the Ministry of Health in Egypt has announced the
country's 11th case of human infection with the H5N1 avian virus and its
3rd death. The case occurred in an 18-year-old girl from the Minufiyah
governorate, north of Cairo. She developed symptoms on 29 Mar 2006, was
hospitalized on 5 Apr, and died today [Thu 6 Apr 2006].Tests conducted by
the country's Central Public Health Laboratory were positive for H5N1
infection.
To date, Egyptian health authorities have confirmed 11 human cases of H5N1
infection. Of these cases, 3 were fatal. In a pattern similar to that seen
elsewhere, all cases have occurred in children and young adults, and all
have a history of close contact with dead or diseased poultry.
The country's first 7 cases and 2 fatalities were described in previous WHO
updates.
The 8th case is a 31-year-old Egyptian national who works in Jordan. The
man recently visited his hometown in Fayoum governorate, south of Cairo,
where poultry outbreaks were officially confirmed during the last week of
February 2006. While there, he participated in the slaughter of poultry. He
returned to Jordan on 29 Mar 2006, following 2 days of travel by ferryboat.
He was hospitalized with symptoms of respiratory disease on 30 Mar 2006. He
remains hospitalized in Jordan in stable condition. Given his exposure
history and what is known about the incubation period of this disease,
health authorities in both Egypt and Jordan have concluded that the man
almost certainly acquired his infection while in Egypt.
The 9th case, announced by the government on Wed 5 Apr 2006, is a
16-month-old girl from the southern governorate of Sohaj. The child's
infection was detected on 4 Apr. She is presently hospitalized in table
condition.
The 10th case, announced today, is an 8-year-old boy from the Qaliubiya
governorate near Cairo. He is presently hospitalized in stable condition.
