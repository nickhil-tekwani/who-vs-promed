Regarding vaccination of livestock, although the number of rabid animals is
small, the potential for human exposure from a rabid cow or horse is
significant. During my time with the Texas Department of Health I reviewed
the number of humans exposed per laboratory proven rabid animal, excluding
animals with no human exposure, which were generally wild animals. Of
those with human exposure, wild animals averaged just over one human
exposed per animal, cats 2 humans exposed per animal, dogs 5 and livestock
9 humans exposed per animal.
