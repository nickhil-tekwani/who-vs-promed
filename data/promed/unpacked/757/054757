Infectious haematopoietic necrosis, Croatia
-------------------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 2 Jan 2014 from Dr Mirjana Matausic-Pisl, Assistant to Minister Ministry of Agriculture, Veterinary Directorate, Ministry of Agriculture, Zagreb, Croatia

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 30 Dec 2013
Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 30 Dec 2013
Report date: 2 Jan 2014
Date submitted to OIE: 2 Jan 2014
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence of a listed disease
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: Infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (basic), laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to the whole country

New outbreaks
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: 1. [2nd Guards Brigade], Plaski, Plaski, [Karlovac County]
Date of start of the outbreak: 30 Dec 2013
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Water type: fresh water
Population type: farmed
Production system: semi-closed
Affected animals:
Species / Morbidity / Mortality / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Rainbow trout (_Oncorhynchus mykiss_) (kg) / 1 (scale 0 to 5) / 1 (scale 0 to 5) / 21 000 / / 50 /0 / 0
Affected population: the infected farm is located on river Dretulja and is the only farm on that river. The farm produces fish (_Oncorhynchus mykiss_) for human consumption and for restocking of open waters. The farm is existing from June 2013, and was populated only with fish originating from viral haemorrhagic septicaemia and infectious haematopoietic necrosis free farms. In November and December [2013], fish were moved in 2 shipments for restocking of open waters nearby Zapresic (Zagreb County). Mortality and morbidity are observed on fish which have reached commercial size. All epidemiological connected farms and open waters are on epidemiological investigation.

Outbreak statistics:
Species / Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate / Apparent case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Rainbow trout (_Oncorhynchus mykiss_) / ** / 0.24 percent / ** / 0.24 percent
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter
** Not calculated because of missing information

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; tracing forward; tracing back; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals.
Measures to be applied: disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); surveillance outside containment and/or buffer zone; official destruction of aquatic animal products; official disposal of carcasses, byproducts and waste; surveillance within containment and/or buffer zone.

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Croatian Veterinary Institute, Zagreb (National laboratory) / rainbow trout (_Oncorhynchus mykiss_) / pathogen isolation on cell culture / 30 Dec 2013 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

The location of the outbreak can be seen on the interactive map included in the OIE report at the source URL above.

[Infectious haematopoietic necrosis (IHN) is a viral disease affecting most species of salmonid fish reared in fresh water or sea water. Caused by the rhabdovirus, infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV), the principal clinical and economic consequences of IHN occur on farms rearing rainbow trout where acute outbreaks can result in very high mortality. However, both Pacific and Atlantic salmon can be severely affected.

Historically, the geographic range of IHN was limited to western North America, but the disease has spread to Europe and Asia via the importation of infected fish and eggs.

Reservoirs of IHNV are clinically infected fish and covert carriers among cultured, feral or wild fish. Virus is shed via urine, sexual fluids, and from external mucus, whereas kidney, spleen, and other internal organs are the sites in which virus is most abundant during the course of overt infection.

Depending on the species of fish, rearing conditions, temperature, and, to some extent, the virus strain, outbreaks of IHN may range from explosive to chronic. Losses in acute outbreaks will exceed several percent of the population per day and cumulative mortality may reach 90-95 percent or more. In chronic cases, losses are protracted and fish in various stages of disease can be observed in the pond.

The most important environmental factor affecting the progress of IHN is water temperature. Experimental trials have demonstrated IHNV can produce mortality from 3 deg C to 18 deg C (37.4-64.4 deg F); however clinical disease typically occurs between 8 deg C and 15 deg C (46.4 deg F-59 deg F) under natural conditions.

The disease is typically characterised by gross signs that include lethargy interspersed with bouts of frenzied, abnormal activity, darkening of the skin, pale gills, ascites, distended abdomen, exophthalmia, and petechial haemorrhages internally and externally.

During outbreaks, fish are typically lethargic with bouts of frenzied, abnormal activity, such as spiral swimming and flashing. A trailing faecal cast is observed in some species. Spinal deformities are present among some of the surviving fish.

Control methods for IHN currently rely on avoidance of exposure to the virus through the implementation of strict control policies and sound hygiene practices. The thorough disinfection of fertilized eggs, the use of virus-free water supplies for incubation and rearing, and the operation of facilities under established biosecurity measures are all critical for preventing IHN at a fish production site.

For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods, and references please refer to the OIE Aquatic Manual 2013, Chapter 2.3.4 "Infectious haematopoietic necrosis", available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/aahm/current/2.3.04_IHN.pdf.

Recommendations for international trade for Infectious haematopoietic necrosis are spelled out in chapter 10.4 of OIE's Aquatic Code at http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=171&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.10.4.htm.

According to information found in the WAHID database under the section "List of countries by sanitary situation" at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statuslist, 133 of 178 OIE Members have provided some information related to Infectious haematopoietic necrosis disease (this information is based on the most recent aquatic 6-monthly report sent by the countries).

Of these 133 OIE Members the disease was reported as "never occurred" in 78, as "absent" in 23, as "suspected" in 2, as "demonstrated clinical disease" in 7 (Germany, Italy, Japan, Poland, Slovenia, Switzerland, Hungary ) and as "restricted to certain zone(s)/region(s) of the country in 3 (Canada, China (People's Rep. of), United States of America).
