SALMONELLA & SUGAR GLIDERS AS PETS: REQUEST FOR INFO
****************************************************
A ProMED-mail post

Sugar Gliders are becoming very popular now as exotic pets. Check out
<http://www.isga.org/> (International Sugar Glider Association) to see what
I'm refering to. I don't own one myself, but a friend of mine has one and
his family claims that his sugar glider is the cause of his nephew's
salmonellosis. Can you refer me to any medical literature which document
known cases? Any help would be appreciated.

[Ed & I checked out this site ... it is well worth visiting. For those who
don't know what a Sugar Glider is, "The Sugar Glider (scientifically known
as _Petaurus breviceps_) is a small Australian marsupial about the size of a
hamster, weighing 4-6 ounces when they are full grown. Being arboreal Sugar
Gliders live under the canopy of leaves of the Australian rain forest. Their
natural habitat ranges from Tasmania to north eastern Australia to Papa New
Guinea and neighboring islands. Currently they are on the endangered species
list as the number of acres that these marsupials live in is decreasing
everyday due to deforestation." While there is no reason to not suspect that
this small marsupial can act as a host for _Salmonella_ sp., is there any
literature on the frequency of them being found infected and/or associated
with domestic cases of human salmonellosis? I suspect we might have maternal
questions here as to how long this animal may be kept. - Mod.MHJ]
