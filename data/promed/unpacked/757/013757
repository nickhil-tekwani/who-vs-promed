The cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in South Africa has exceeded the 100 000 mark to reach 101 590, according to the latest official update released early Tuesday [23 Jun 2020].

Another 61 deaths related to COVID-19 were added to the national death toll which now stood at 1991, Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said.

The mortality rate was 2 percent while the number of recoveries stood at 53 444, translating to a recovery rate of 52.6 percent, said Mkhize.

It took South Africa 14 days to double the number of confirmed cases from 50 000 to 101 590, compared with 94 days during which the number of cases doubled and rose to 50 000 from [5 Mar to 8 Jun 2020]

The doubling of coronavirus cases in 14 days was seen as a result of the rise in mass community testing.

The country has completed 1 353 176 tests so far, of which 25 116 new tests were conducted in the past 24 hours, according to Mkhize.

[2] Indonesia: pandemic impact on national, global efforts to end TB
Date: Tue 23 Jun 2020 2:49 PM WITA

COVID-19-related lockdown measures are creating barriers to access to comprehensive tuberculosis (TB) services.

A 30-year-old researcher is scrambling to get regular medicine and treatment for her TB at a private hospital next to her office in South Jakarta but found nothing left at the hospital amid the COVID-19 pandemic since early April [2020].

"I was diagnosed with TB a year ago and have to go through TB medication for one year without interruption. Now, I am in my 7th month of medication, but I am very worried that the medicines are scarce now and that I have to repeat my TB treatment from zero," said [the woman], who braved the large-scale social restrictions (PSBB) enforced in the capital city of Jakarta to get her medicines.

She is not alone. Millions of people with TB in Indonesia and other countries in the world fear the disruption of their medical treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Early diagnosis, contact tracing, initiation of TB treatment, uninterrupted treatment, follow-up, side-effect management, monitoring and treatment, and other TB care is being affected, making it hard for TB patients to access needed healthcare services.

As of mid-June 2020, most Asia Pacific countries are still locked down to some extent because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Indonesia is no exception, although some cities, including the capital of Jakarta, have started opening businesses, offices, and public transportation.

The present COVID-19 chaos could weaken the quality of TB data that high-burden countries such as Indonesia are able to collect and analyze.

With an estimated 1.2 million people with TB, Indonesia accounts for about 10 percent of the global TB case number. About 760 000 (49 percent of the global total) people die from TB each year in the region, and more than 65 000 people die in Indonesia every year.

"Around 3 of 10 million TB patients are deemed 'missing', because either they have not been detected or they have not reported to health authorities," stressed Tara Singh Bam, deputy director for the Asia-Pacific region of the Paris-based International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases (The Union).

"We [The Union] believe that health services, including programs to combat TB, need to be actively engaged in ensuring an effective and rapid response to COVID-19 while ensuring that TB services are maintained and uninterrupted," explained Tara.

TB is still the most deadly infectious respiratory disease in the world, with 1.5 million people dying of TB annually, or 4000 every day, and the number of people who develop the TB disease, around 10 million, has been relatively static for decades.

TB affects mostly low- or middle-income countries, where widespread poverty, a lack of medical care and little public health intervention allows the disease to spread in cramped living conditions.

Just a few weeks prior to the 1st COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan between Christmas 2019 and New Year's Eve, Indonesia hosted the launch of the Global Plan as a follow-up commitment to the 2018 United Nations political declaration to end TB, with specific targets by 2022 (40 million people treated for TB, including 3.5 million children and 1.5 million people with drug resistance).

The Global Plan explains the need for new diagnostic tools, medicine, and ultimately, a TB vaccine, explained Paula Fujiwara, scientific director of The Union in a virtual interview after the launching.

"In fact, this is what has to be done immediately to provide the resources to develop these tools," Paula said adding that research would take time, but during the time tools are being developed, each part of the global community had a part to play.

"Why we chose Indonesia as the host is because we looked at countries with a high TB burden, and the country is the best place where we think we can intervene with the government and make a big impact-by bringing political awareness and advocacy to the topic," she maintained.

With support from the chair of the Indonesian Stop TB Partnership, Arifin Panigoro, the Global Plan to End TB has received a strong political commitment from Indonesian President Joko "Jokowi" Widodo.

What was most concerning, Paula said, was that Indonesia still lagged behind in the treatment of people with TB, which is only 67 percent.

"This means Indonesia is not yet diagnosing 23 percent of the estimated number of people with TB," added Paula.

The COVID-19 pandemic will likely halt the implementation of the Global Plan to End TB as well as regional and national efforts.

A study by The Union's scientists found that COVID-19 has impacted all research activities and scientific conferences on TB and has caused delays in the distribution of TB drugs, diagnosis, and vaccine trials, which could have a big impact on when new tools can be introduced.

"Years of under-investment in supporting health systems respond to TB have made TB and its drug resistant forms the biggest infectious disease killer with over 4000 deaths per day. We can't afford to repeat these mistakes and be unprepared for pandemics like COVID-19," said the Union's executive director, Jose Luis Castro.

Huge efforts were currently being made to develop COVID-19 tests, drugs and vaccines, he noted. "This could have a chilling effect on research and development for new TB technology," Castro added.

"TB is already under-funded by about USD 3 billion per year. Donor support [via the Global Fund, PEPFAR [US President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief] and Unitaid], therefore, might be critical to tide over this looming crisis," he noted.

Castro further said a diversion of TB funding to COVID-19 was a real concern.

"Every effort should be made to minimize this. The bigger concern, in the longer term, is that countries will cut expenditure on TB because of the possible massive economic loss due to the outbreak."

[There may be grave consequences for existing and undiagnosed TB patients globally, particularly in low and middle income countries (LMICs) where TB is endemic and health services are poorly equipped. As also highlighted in the report above, many countries are experiencing the impact of the pandemic on the various aspects of tuberculosis prevention and control.

According to the guidance issued by the WHO and Global TB program "All measures should be taken to ensure continuity of services for people who need preventive and curative treatment for TB. Health authorities should maintain support to essential TB services, including during emergencies such as COVID-19. People-centred delivery of TB prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and care services should be ensured in tandem with the COVID-19 response" (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/documents/ tuberculosis/ infonote-tb-covid-19.pdf).

Even though the modes of transmission of the 2 diseases are slightly different, administrative, environmental, and personal protection measures apply to both (such as basic infection prevention and control, cough etiquette, patient triage). Measures must be put in place to limit transmission of TB and COVID-19 in congregate settings and health care facilities, as per WHO guidelines.

Accurate diagnostic tests are essential for both TB and COVID-19. The symptoms of TB and COVID-19 can be similar, with for example cough and fever. Not only can this create diagnostic confusion, but it could worsen the stigmatization of TB patients especially in LMICs, given the fear of COVID-19. Tests for the 2 conditions are different and both should be made available for individuals with respiratory symptoms, which may be similar for the 2 diseases.

TB laboratory networks have been established in countries with the support of WHO and international partners. These networks, as well as specimen transportation mechanisms, are being used in many countries to support COVID-19 diagnosis and surveillance.

A people-centred outpatient and community-based care should be strongly preferred over hospital treatment (unless serious conditions require it) for TB patients to reduce opportunities for transmission. Provision of anti-tuberculosis treatment, in line with the latest WHO guidelines, must be ensured for all TB patients, including those in COVID-19 quarantine and those with confirmed COVID-19 disease. Adequate stocks of TB medicines should be provided to all patients to take home to ensure treatment completion without having to visit treatment centres unnecessarily to collect medicines.

Appropriate planning and monitoring are essential to ensure that procurement and supply of TB medicines and diagnostics are not interrupted. - Mod.UBA

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
-----------------------------------------
The Americas region reported 50.8% of the global newly reported cases and 54.3% of newly reported deaths for this 24-hour period. The USA reported 38.5% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, Brazil reported 31.2%, Mexico 6.6%, Chile 5.5%, Colombia 3.6 % and Peru 3.6%. The same 5 countries remained at the top; Columbia is sharing position no 5 with Peru... the USA and Brazil are usually numbers 1 and 2 although they vary for which of the 2 positions they hold.

The European region reported 14.0% of the global newly reported cases and 17.6% of the newly confirmed deaths in the region. Russia reported 37.8% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Sweden 10.0%, Turkey 6.6%, Ukraine 4.9%, the UK 4.8%, Germany 3.1% and Belarus 2.4%. Again, the same countries with the addition of Sweden, minor juggling of orders and percentages day by day, although the proportion of cases represented by Russia has fallen.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 13.1% of the global newly reported cases and 10.6% of global newly reported fatalities. Pakistan reported 22.0% of the regional newly reported cases followed by Saudi Arabia 17.7%, Iran 13.8%, Iraq 10.3%, Egypt 7.5%, Oman 7.5%, and Qatar 6.6%. Same countries, minor juggling of positions (Oman and Egypt switched positions).

The African region reported 5.4% of the global newly reported cases and 4.1% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 61.6% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Nigeria 6.2%, Ghana 5.6%, Cote d'Ivoire 3.1%, Ethiopia 2.5%, Algeria 2.1%, and Cameroon 2.0%. While South Africa and Nigeria are usually numbers 1 and 2 in terms of the 24-hour increase in cases, other countries have less consistent reporting patterns and vary considerably from day to day although Cameroon, Ethiopia, Central African Republic, and Mauritania bear watching.

The Western Pacific region reported 1.1% of the global newly reported cases and 0.43% of global deaths. The Philippines reported 80.3% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Singapore 8.4%, Japan 3.9 %, South Korea 3.6%, and China 2.0%. The outbreak associated with the Beijing Seafood markets continues to bring China to prominence in terms of daily newly confirmed cases. That said, the Philippines and Singapore are consistently numbers 1 and 2, respectively, and the other countries, including Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Australia, vary in daily reporting.

The South East Asia region reported 15.6% of the global newly reported cases and 13.0% of global deaths. India reported 75.9% of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 16.2%, Indonesia 5.0%, and Nepal 2.6%. Same countries, same order as in previous days, with India continuing to be the driving force in the regional growth in cases.

Impression: Europe seems to be stabilizing at a significantly lower rate, although Russia is still reporting 7000+ new cases a day (down from 8000+ per day). The Eastern Mediterranean had surpassed the European region in the past few days, but is slightly behind today (24 Jun 2020), with Pakistan reporting around 4000+ cases a day (almost 3900 today 24 Jun 2020) and Saudi Arabia reporting around 4000+ cases a day (over 3100 today 24 Jun 2020). South East Asia has overtaken both the European and Eastern Mediterranean regions, with India reporting 8000-10 000+ cases a day (over 15 000 cases today 24 Jun 2020). The Americas region is usually reporting around 70 000 cases a day (over 68 000 cases today 24 Jun 2020), with Brazil usually reporting 25 000-30 000+ cases a day (over 21 000 cases today 24 Jun 2020) and the USA at 20 000-25 000+ a day (over 26 000 today 23 Jun 2020). In the Africa region, the regional proportion is slowly climbing, with South Africa reporting in the 3000-4000+ range daily, and the Western Pacific region is maintaining a very low rate compared with the other regions, with the Philippines averaging 500+ cases per day (over 1000 cases today 24 Jun 2020). (Singapore had been reporting twice as many cases per day for a period of time but has dropped back over the past couple of weeks).

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 24 Jun 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. Europe has significantly decreased. The Americas region continues to increase, as does South East Asia, in terms of daily newly confirmed cases; the African region is noticeably increasing as well. The Americas region continues to greatly outnumber all other regions for daily reporting. - Mod.UBA]

[*On 2 Jun 2020, France completed a review of all positive lab tests reported and removed all duplicate tests on individuals who were counted more than once. This led to a decrease in cumulative case counts.
In the table above, NA is "not applicable"; those countries whose 1st case was reported after 1 Mar 2020 did not have cases on 1 Mar 2020. - Mod.UBA]

Countries with more than 5000 cases not on the list above (as the list has grown longer, we froze the list and maintain a list of countries passing the 5000-case mark):

[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of reported cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 9 429 472, with reports of cases by 217 countries and territories worldwide. The global case count rose by 0.9% in the past 24 hours. The USA, with more than 2.43 million confirmed cases, now represents 25.8% of the global cases of COVID-19, and Brazil, having crossed the 1 million mark (more than 1.15 million cases), represents 12.3% of the global cases of COVID-19. Other countries such as Chile, Peru, Mexico, India, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Pakistan are reporting increased numbers of new and cumulative cases as well. A global total of 481 622 deaths have been reported, an increase of 1817 deaths in the past 24 hours. A reminder that in the absence of well-developed contact-tracing activities with testing of asymptomatic and mildly ill contacts, numbers of SARS-CoV-2 virus infections are significantly underreported: actual numbers may be 10-20 times larger. There are also individuals who stay at home throughout their illness, sometimes, unfortunately, dying at home, who are never officially confirmed as infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These data are presented to provide relative indicators of the situations in each of the countries and comparisons between countries and regions of the world.

In descending rank order, the USA is number 1 for cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19, followed by Brazil, Russia, India, the UK, Spain, Peru, Chile, Italy, and Iran at number 10. China is number 21. In descending rank order, India is number 1 for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by the USA, Russia, Mexico, Brazil, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia and Peru, all countries that are currently experiencing major community-based transmission and considered global hot spots.

The top 20 countries in terms of cumulative cases include 7 from the European region, 6 from the Americas region, 4 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 from the South-East Asia region, and 1 from the African region, no change in the past 24 hours. There are no countries from the Western Pacific region. The top 20 countries in terms of numbers of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours include 8 from the Americas region, 6 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 3 from the European region, 2 from the South East Asia region, and 1 from the African region. Again, there are no countries from the Western Pacific region. This listing very much reflects the "hot spots" in terms of countries and regions with ongoing high transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. - Mod.UBA]
