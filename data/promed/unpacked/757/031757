The number of cases of Legionnaires' disease reported in Ontario is
higher than usual this year [2011], prompting public health units
across the province to increase surveillance for the disease.

Dr. Arlene King, Ontario's chief medical officer of health, said 116
cases of Legionnaires' disease have already been reported in 2011.
Last year, the province saw a total of 116 cases.

"The number of detections . . . since 2006 has gone up slightly every
year," King said. There were 69 cases in 2006.

Public health experts are not sure why Ontario is more cases. King
suspects that this year's long, hot summer may be a factor because
warm water temperatures can contribute to the growth of _Legionella
pneumophila_, the bacterium which causes the disease.

Legionnaires' disease, which is treatable with antibiotics, is spread
through aerosolized water or with contact with soil, and not
person-to-person. King said man-made water supplies, everything from
hot tubs to shower heads to air cooling towers, can be sources of
_Legionella_ bacteria.

In 2005, an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease in a Scarborough nursing
home killed more than 20 people. After launching an investigation,
public health officials found _Legionella_ bacteria in the air cooling
tower atop the residence. They said the bacteria were spread
throughout the home via the ventilation system.

King said 15 health units have reported cases of Legionnaires' disease
to the province. Health officials have analyzed each reported case to
see if there is a common source of bacteria.

"There have been isolated cases throughout the province," King said.
"There is no evidence there is any common source related to the
increases we have seen in the months of August through October."

In Ontario, 56 people have been hospitalized and 4 people have died
due to Legionnaires' disease. King said most cases are of people over
the age of 50 and many have a history of smoking or have other
underlying medical conditions.

Toronto Public Health has seen 33 cases since 1 Aug 2011, all of which
were hospitalized. There has been one death due to Legionnaires'
disease in Toronto.

Ontario's public health units have notified local family doctors and
emergency room physicians to be on the watch for signs and symptoms of
Legionnaires' disease in their patients.

There have been a higher-than-normal number of cases of Legionnaires'
disease in Ontario this year [2011], and health officials aren't sure
why.

The province has already seen 116 cases of the acute lung infection
reported this year, compared to a total of 116 in 2010 and 69 in 2006,
according to David Jansen, a spokesperson with the Ontario Ministry of
Health and Long-Term Care.

Legionnaires' disease, which could be fatal in some cases, is spread
through aerosolized water and soil, and not person-to-person contact.
The severity of the disease varies. Its common symptoms are coughing,
malaise, and fever.

In Ontario, an estimated 7574 episodes are attributable to the
bacterium causing the disease called _Legionella pneumophila_ each
year.

Jansen said in an e-mail that health officials are not sure why the
number of reported cases has gone up this year, "since there has been
no common cause behind the cases in 2011."

However, he notes that the high temperatures this past summer might
have contributed to the rise in cases. "This year's long, hot summer
may be a factor because warm water temperatures can contribute to the
growth of _Legionella pneumophila_," he said. Jensen recommends
"proper maintenance of all mist-producing devices such as shower
heads, hot tubs, whirlpools, and humidifiers" to prevent the spread of
the bacteria.

[Legionnaires' disease is rarely confirmed with laboratory testing
because most cases of pneumonia are treated empirically without
identifying the causative pathogen. Therefore, analyzing only reported
cases of Legionnaires' disease would severely underestimate the burden
of this disease. Therefore, using an attributable fraction from
various epidemiologic studies in the literature, the Ontario Agency
for Health Protection and Promotion and the Institute for Clinical
Evaluative Sciences estimated that each year an average of 7574
episodes of pneumonia in the province could be attributed to
_Legionella_
(http://www.ices.on.ca/file/ONBOIDS_FullReport_intra.pdf).

Legionellosis is an infectious disease caused by a Gram-negative
bacillus of the genus _Legionella_, most commonly _Legionella
pneumophila_. Legionnaires' disease is the acute pneumonic form of the
disease. Pontiac fever is a non-pneumonic form of legionellosis that
is less severe than Legionnaires' disease. Legionellosis is generally
acquired by inhalation of an infectious dose of aerosolized
_Legionella_. Water temperatures of 25-40 deg C (77-104 deg F) support
the highest concentrations of the organism in water storage tanks of
plumbing systems. Aerosolization of the contaminated warm water can
occur in showers, spa pools, sprays in groceries, fountains, cooling
towers, and car washes.
