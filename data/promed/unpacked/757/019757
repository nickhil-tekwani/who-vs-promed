AMANTADINE FOR INFLUENZA (3)
============================
In non-edematous patients with stable renal function who are not massively
obese, clearance can be accurately estimated from the serum creatinine alone
[Cockcroft DW, Gault MH: Nephron 1976;16:31] with the following formula
(for women multiply the calculated result by 0.85):

(140 - age [yrs]) x (wt [kg])
Clearance [mL/min] = -----------------------------
(72 x creatinine [mg/dL])
