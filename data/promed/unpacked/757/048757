The Director of the government's disease monitoring outfit, IEDCR [Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (Bangladesh)], Prof Mahmudur Rahman on [Sun 27 Jan 2013] said 2 more died of [Nipah virus infection] taking the total death toll this year [2013] to 8.

The new deaths were from Pabna and Rajshahi while one 8-month old boy is struggling for life in the Rajshahi Medical College Hospital.

The virus that infects a person only after drinking raw date sap and later can pass on to other people through contact is a cause of public health concern in Bangladesh since 2001, as it breaks out every year during January-April.

Drinking raw date or palm sap in the morning is an age-old practice in Bangladesh, especially in rural areas, but IEDCR suggests drinking boiled sap or molasses and washing hands with soap after caring for patients.

The IEDCR Director told bdnews24.com that the Health Education Bureau had been instructed by the health minister to launch mass media campaign. "This year [2013] we saw an early spike of the virus, infecting 11 people within a couple of weeks," he said. He said they had sent the Nipah [virus infection case] management guidelines for clinicians in every district where the virus is prevalent.

Visiting Director of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention Dr Thomas R Frieden when asked by journalists said that it's entirely a health education issue as drinking raw date sap [contaminated with the virus] can cause the infection. "But changing behaviour is very hard," he said and that they had a project with ICDDR,B in Dhaka to see 'ways of reducing the risk by reducing raw date sap consumption.' He said US CDC helps Bangladesh with testing materials to diagnose the virus.

This year [2013] IEDCR confirmed 1st death from Nipah virus on Tuesday [22 Jan 2013] in Dhaka in a family who brought date sap from Bhaluka, an upazila [subdistrict] in Mymensingh [see ProMED-mail archive no. 20130124.1513132]. On Friday [25 Jan 2013] it confirmed 5 more deaths.

The fatality rate from the virus is nearly 80 per cent while it is fully preventable if people shun the consumption of raw date sap.

It usually takes 7-8 days on an average between exposure and signs of symptoms -- fever, altered mental status and seizure.

Nipah virus was first detected in Malaysia in 1998 but at present Bangladesh, a hotspot for infectious diseases, is the only country in the world that reports the disease [although the virus has been detected in _Pteropus_ bats in West Bengal, India (see ProMED mail archive no. 20130124.1513132 for the journal reference). - Mod.TY]

An ICDDR,B study using infrared cameras found that fruit bats perch on the jars, put up on trees to collect the sap, and try to drink the juice. They also urinate into the pot.

The _Pteropus_ bats' saliva and urine carry the virus. But it gets destroyed if the sap is boiled. "The virus is killed in 70 deg C [158 deg F] temperature," Prof Rahman said.

As of 2012, the virus has killed 136 of its 176 victims in 21 districts across Bangladesh.

Director of the Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) Prof Mahmudur Rahman on Friday [24 Jan 2013] said they found 6 people infected in Rajbarhi, Jhenaidah, Naogaon, Natore, and Gaibandha, of whom 5 died. "A mother died in Natore leaving her 8-month baby infected," he told bdnews24.com.

The virus that infects a person only after drinking raw date sap and later can pass on to other persons through contact is a cause of public health concern in Bangladesh since 2001, as it breaks out every year during January-April.

The fatality rate is nearly 80 percent while it is fully preventable if people shun the raw date sap.

Prof Rahman says it usually takes 7-8 days on an average between exposure and signs of symptoms -- fever, altered mental status, and seizure.

Drinking raw date or palm sap in the morning is an old practice in Bangladesh, especially in rural areas, but IEDCR suggests drinking boiled sap or molasses and washing hands with soap after caring patients.

Earlier, on Wednesday [23 Jan 2013], IEDCR confirmed the death of an 8-year-old boy in Dhaka from the virus that left his father critically ill at a hospital [see ProMED-mail archive no. 20130124.1513132]. Prof Rahman said the father of the minor boy was still struggling at the hospital, "but the good news is that rest of his family members is free from the virus". The family drank raw date sap brought from Bhaluka on 11 Jan 2013 and fell ill 6 days later. The boy passed away on Tuesday [22 Jan 2013] at a Dhaka clinic.

The Director, however, said the man who distributed 100 bottles in different families in Dhaka was not 'co-operating' with them after the media reported that one had died. "We are trying to find out all of those families so that we can monitor those families," he said and added that the new cases were detected from their 5 regular surveillance sites.

He said a team of ICDDR,B on zoonotic or transmittable diseases was working in Bhaluka in Mymensingh where the virus appeared to have struck this year for the 1st time.

Nipah virus was first detected in Malaysia in 1998 but at present Bangladesh, a hotspot for infectious diseases, is the only country in the world that reports the disease. Though public health analysts believe that border districts of India have the virus, reports are not available from the Indian government to confirm it [the presence of the virus in India has been published (see ProMED mail archive no. 20130124.1513132 for the journal reference). - Mod.TY].

An ICDDR,B study using infrared cameras found that fruit bats perch on the jars, put up on trees to collect the sap, and try to drink the juice. They also urinate into the pot.

The _Pteropus_ bats' saliva and urine carry the virus. But it gets destroyed if the sap is boiled. "The virus is killed in 70 deg C [158 deg F] temperature," Prof Rahman said.

[Changing long-established habits is difficult. Getting the local people to boil palm sap will not be easy and will require an effective public information effort, particularly because cases of Nipah virus infection are sporadic and occur over scattered locations. Scientists with villagers have constructed a type of "skirt" made of local materials that denies access of the bats to the palm sap collecting jars. Clearly, this simple technology needs to be spread around through public education, particularly when the bats are pregnant and lactating, when the virus is shed. - Mod.TY
