BRUCELLA CANIS INFECTIONS, CANINE - COSTA RICA
**********************************************

This is the first of an outbreak of _Brucella canis_ in a small community of
Costa Rica (Las Cruces, San Pablo, Heredia, Costa Rica).
The first dog was taken to a private veterinarian, who suspected it could be
brucellosis because he had orchitis. He sent some samples to a private
laboratory , they came back positive for _Brucella_ (serologically). Then the
veterinarian contacted me and we decided to do some culturing from the
testis. It was _Brucella canis_. The owner of the animal suspected that a
female dog could be the source of infection. The veterinarian drew some
blood and we did a culturing from it [presumably the bitch], which was
positive for _Brucella canis_, too.
There has been some concern about the disease among the people of the
community. We are going to have a meeting with some of the Health Ministry
people and community members next Wednesday May 7. At this point we do not
know how many dogs are infected and apparently there are no human cases, yet.

[Magaly .. thanks for informing us of this diagnosis. The literature on the
prevalence of _B.canis_ in dog populations is not extensive. Would anyone
with such knowledge care to share it with us? - Mod.MHJ]
