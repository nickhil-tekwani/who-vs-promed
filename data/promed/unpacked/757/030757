9 people went to the hospital, and many others were prevented from
withdrawing their monthly pay at a bank in Campo Grande, Rio de Janeiro
state [not to be confused with the capital of Mato Grosso state].
A strong-smelling yellow powder left next to the automatic teller machines
inside the bank on the night of Sun 4 Apr 2004 strongly irritated the eyes
and noses of those who entered the area.Those most affected were 7 firemen
who were called to the scene on Mon 5 Apr at 8am, and 2 bank employees.
Security cameras caught the image of the person who deposited the powder.
Men from the Dangerous Products Operations Group were mobilized to clean up
the powder. They wore protective suits and used brooms. Not enough powder
was collected for an analysis to be done, and when experts from the Carlos
Eboli Criminal Institute arrived at the scene, they found it had been
cleaned up.

[The report indicates a strong smell, but does not describe it. The report
says that brooms were used during the clean-up procedure, so the powder may
not have been easily aerosolized. For so many people to have been affected,
the area must have been small and poorly ventilated. Other than saying that
the people were taken to the hospital, the only indication of the signs and
symptoms relate to irritating nose and eyes. ProMED-mail would appreciate
any further details about this event. - Mod.TG]
