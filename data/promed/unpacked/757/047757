Authorities have revealed that raccoons in Central Park [New York City] have been dying from a viral outbreak of an infectious disease that makes them act like "zombies." It is believed that 26 raccoons found dead in the park since 24 Jun [2018] were infected with canine distemper virus, which is contagious to dogs if they have not been vaccinated against it, officials told the New York Post.

Symptoms of distemper include unusual tameness, disorientation, appearing confused, lack of coordination and aggressive behavior, and have been noticed in other raccoons around the park. "They looked like they were circulating, wandering, having spasms," Dr. Sally Slavinski, an assistant director at the Health Department, said.

Of the 26 raccoon corpses that were found in the park in the last month [June 2018], 2 were tested and returned positive results for the canine distemper disease. The others were not tested but are believed to have died of the same cause, given the timing of their deaths and the proximity in which their bodies were found to where the infected raccoons were found.

Raccoons remaining alive in the park that appear to be infected have city personnel worried. "Some of the [living] raccoons had some sort of nasal discharge," Slavinski said. The nasal discharge is alarming because the disease can be spread when other animals come into contact with the bodily fluids, such as saliva, urine, feces, or respiratory discharge, of an infected animal.

Humans cannot contract canine distemper from an animal, like they can with a disease like rabies. None of the dead raccoons tested positive for rabies.

Although dogs and cats in the city are required to be vaccinated for rabies, distemper vaccinations are only required of animals that are taken to boarding or grooming facilities. In addition to unvaccinated dogs, other animals at risk include Central Park skunks and exotic large cats, like the snow leopards at the Central Park Zoo. Canine distemper can also spread to coyotes, foxes, and ferrets.

It is not known whether the distemper outbreak has spread to any other parks in New York City at this time.

[Canine distemper virus is the pathogen most frequently causing outbreaks at the carnivore wildlife-domestic interface. As distemper and rabies affect the central nervous system, they both cause behavior disorders. Distemper usually results in stumbling and lack of "shyness;" animals can seem "dumb" and/or "friendly." Animals showing similar behavioral signs might be rabid. It is important to make sure to keep the vaccination schemes of all dogs, cats, and ferrets in the area up to date. - Mod.PMB
