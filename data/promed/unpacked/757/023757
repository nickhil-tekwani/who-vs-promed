[3] England (Herefordshire), poultry, HPAI H5N8
Date: Thu 12 Nov 2020
Source: Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) [abridged, edited]

Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N8 was confirmed on [10 Nov 2020] in broiler breeder chickens at a premise near Leominster, in Herefordshire. A 3km [approx. 1.8 mi] Protection Zone and 10km [approx. 6.2 mi] surveillance zone have been put in place around the infected premises.

[The conclusion of the last outbreak assessment report for the cases in both LPAI and HPAI in UK and Europe, published on 10 Nov 2020 by DEFRA-APHA, mentioned that:

"As a consequence of the H5N8 HPAI poultry outbreak in the UK, and in Germany and the Netherlands; as well as the increasing HPAI H5N8 events in wild birds in the UK, Ireland and the Netherlands and Germany this week, and the known migration routes on to the UK from these countries; the risk of HPAI incursion in wild birds in the UK is High. The overall risk of infection of poultry in the UK is Medium; although it should be noted that the risk of introduction to individual premises depends upon the level of biosecurity implemented on farm to prevent direct or indirect contact with wild birds. We recommend biosecurity measures should be maintained or strengthened, as required.

"We strongly recommend that all poultry keepers (including backyard keepers) review their biosecurity measures and business continuity plans, as the risk has now increased. Keepers should familiarize themselves with government guidance on good biosecurity and how to report suspicion of disease appropriately". The full report is available at https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/934708/hpai-europe-201110.pdf

Further information on these new cases in the UK, including the restrictions and movement controls, can be seen at Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs' (DEFRA) and the Animal and Plant Health Agency's (APHA) "Guidance on Avian Influenza (Bird Flu)" website at https://www.gov.uk/guidance/avian-influenza-bird-flu#latest-situation, (latest update 12 Nov 2020).
