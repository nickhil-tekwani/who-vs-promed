On [Thu 23 Nov 2017], the public college of Julie-Victoire-Daubié in Saint-Philbert-de-Grandlieu [Loire-Atlantique department, Pays de la Loire region] seemed deserted. For good reason, since 166 of the 456 students were absent for illness. All were struck by the same digestive disorders, with fever and abdominal pain ... The symptoms aroused a suspicion of foodborne illness. The students were reportedly poisoned inside the school, according to the regional health agency (ARS) taken over by Ouest-France. Fortunately, the situation is not serious enough to report according to the ARS.

Is food, drink, or lack of hygiene in the preparation of meals the source of the illnesses? An investigation is in progress and microbial analyses have been carried out to find out the exact cause of the digestive disorders of the middle school students. The results will be known next week [week of 4 Dec 2017] according to [the newspaper] "20 minutes". The parents of sick students were asked to fill in a questionnaire on what their children ate in the school canteen.

In 2015, 1390 outbreaks of collective food poisoning were reported in France, affecting 11 429 people. 641 of them were hospitalized and 5 died according to the Public Health France agency. The most frequently confirmed pathogen was _Salmonella_ with 48 percent of the outbreaks for which an agent was confirmed (43 percent in 2014).

[No information is available regarding the incubation period between ingestion of the alleged food and onset of illness, what symptoms occurred (nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea), whether fever was present, and how long the illnesses lasted. This information can be quite useful in assessing possible etiology until test results are available.

ProMED would appreciate information from knowledgeable sources on the results of the investigation. - Mod.LL
