A new case of equine herpes virus-1 (EHV-1) has been confirmed in a horse in Oregon. The state agriculture department received confirmation of the case over the weekend.

The 14 year old quarter horse gelding from Marion County has been hospitalized at the Oregon State University College of Veterinary Medicine's Large Animal Hospital. It was admitted following the sudden onset of neurological signs. The horse has since tested positive for both the common wild type of EHV-1 and the more serious neuropathogenic form.

Oregon has confirmed several cases of EHV-1 in horses in recent weeks, but authorities have classified the latest case as a separate event, given the length of time since the last case and a lack of links to the previous cases. The affected horse has not traveled or attended any shows or events for at least 4 months, the state's agriculture department said.

The stable has been quarantined and all horses involved remain under active observation by owners and their veterinarians. Six of the 8 quarantines associated with the previous EHV-1 cases have been released and 2 are pending.

EHV-1 is naturally occurring and widespread among horses. It may lie dormant in horses for long periods and then re-activate during stress. EHV-1 can cause respiratory disease, abortions in pregnant mares, and occasionally neurologic disease, which can prove fatal.

The commonest way for EHV-1 to spread is by direct horse-to-horse contact. The virus can also spread through contaminated equipment, clothing, and hands. Signs include fever, decreased coordination, nasal discharge, urine dribbling, loss of tail tone, hind limb weakness, leaning against a wall or fence to maintain balance, lethargy, and the inability to rise. While there is no cure, the signs of the disease may be treatable.

All horse owners are encouraged to practice strict biosecurity measures and hygiene if they travel to shows and competitions with their animals. Concerned owners should contact their veterinarian if they have questions.

[This disease has a profound effect on horses and owners. Horses have a very tough time recovering from this disease, and owners have a difficult time treating or euthanizing their pets/companions. This disease is not to be toyed with. Owners should heed the words of the veterinarians. Enforce the rest and isolation of your horse. Protect your horse and other horses as well.

This disease can spread fairly fast. It is often recommended to take the animal's temperature at least twice a day to help catch an early rise, which may be the 1st sign of the disease. If there is a rise in resting temperature (1st thing in the morning, before the animals have begun to move around much), then it is advisable to contact your veterinarian immediately. - Mod.TG
