Lassa fever, Benin
------------------
EVENT DESCRIPTION
On [8 Jan 2018], a suspected case of viral haemorrhagic fever was reported from the Tanguiéta-Matéri-Cobly health zone of the Boukoumbé commune in Benin. The index case was a 35 year-old male residing in Nigeria but originally from Nadoba village in Togo, which borders Boukoumbé.

He became ill on [15 Dec 2017] while in Nigeria and travelled to Nadoba to stay with relatives. On [8 Jan 2018] he was admitted in the Saint Jean de Dieu hospital in Tanguiéta in Benin with symptoms including high grade fever, haematemesis, bleeding gums, conjunctivitis and abdominal pain. He died on [9 Jan 2018] and a safe and dignified burial was conducted on [10 Jan 2018] in Boukoumbé. On [13 Jan 2018], blood samples sent to the national laboratory in Cotonou tested positive for Lassa fever by PCR.

As of [17 Jan 2018], a cumulative total of 4 cases including 3 deaths (case fatality rate 75 percent) had been reported from Boukoumbé commune (one confirmed/index and one suspected) and Toucountouna commune (one probable and one suspected). All 4 cases initially developed symptoms while residing in Nigeria and subsequently travelled to Benin. To date, in Benin, 144 contacts have been identified, including 47 (32 percent) in health facilities and 97 in the community. There are also contacts that are being followed in Togo.

PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIONS
- WHO is supporting the Ministry of Health in the coordination of surveillance and response activities.
- A national rapid response team has been deployed to affected communes to support the local teams.
- The National Director of Public Health has briefed the media regarding Lassa fever.
- Contact tracing has been initiated in affected districts. There are 80 contacts currently under 21-day follow-up in 5 communes: Boukoumbé (36), Natitingou (28), Tanguiéta (9), Toucoutouna (5), and Tchaourou (2); 64 additional contacts in Togo (Nadoba) are being followed up by Togolese authorities.
- All health workers have been orientated in the detection and management of suspected Lassa fever cases.
- Personal protective equipment has been supplied to health facilities involved in Lassa fever case management.
- Risk communication and social mobilization activities have been intensified in the affected communities.
- Traditional healers and community leaders have been sensitized on Lassa fever prevention and control measures.

SITUATION INTERPRETATION
The most recent Lassa fever outbreak in Benin occurred in February 2017 and also involved case importation from Nigeria. Lassa fever is endemic in bordering Nigeria and given the frequent population movements between Nigeria and Benin, the occurrence of additional cases is not unexpected. Strengthening of cross-border collaboration and information exchange between the 2 countries is therefore needed. Furthermore, infection prevention and control measures should be enhanced in health facilities to mitigate the risk of transmission to healthcare workers. Finally, concerted efforts should be made to strengthen active surveillance in order to improve early case detection and management and reduce case fatality.

[Lassa fever outbreaks have afflicted Nigeria a lot in the last 5 years, and now it has been exported to Benin. There are also fears that the outbreak might spread to Togo since the index case in this report is a Togolese and had contact with people who have traveled to Togo.

As of January 2018, Lassa fever outbreaks have been active in at least 16 of 36 states in Nigeria. Hundreds of people have been infected, and scores of them have died. In an era of increased ease of travel, the outbreak's spread has the potential to cause an international pandemic if not checked.

Nigeria seems to be struggling with containing these Lassa fever outbreaks. Help from international humanitarian organizations might be needed to contain the outbreaks to stop them from spreading to other countries. - Mod.YA]

[Lassa fever virus is endemic in much of northwest Africa, including Benin, Togo, and Burkina Faso. Although the 4 cases reported above all acquired their Lassa fever virus infections in Nigeria, the virus is also present in Benin. The previously reported reappearance of Lassa fever cases in Benin in an outbreak that occurred between [21 Jan and 16 Feb 2016] is an indication that the virus is endemic in that country with cases reported in 7 departments (71 cases, 6 confirmed, 10 probable and 55 suspected) in Borgou (52), Collines (13), Oueme (2), Alibori (1), Atlantique (1), Kouffo (1) and Littoral (1); with a total of 23 deaths recorded in the departments of Borgou (16), Collines (4), Atlantique (1), Oueme (1) and Plateau).

The Lassa fever virus rodent reservoirs (species in the genus _Mastomys_) are widely distributed across West and Central Africa. Control of these rodents is difficult and expensive. However, public education efforts at the village level can help to reduce exposure resulting from food materials and the environment contaminated by urine, feces and saliva of these infected rodents.

Since nosocomial transmission can occur when health care personnel are exposed to blood and other fluids of infected patients -- as apparently happened the 2016 outbreak--, it is essential that health care personnel have access to personal protective equipment and are trained to use it effectively and safely. - Mod.TY
