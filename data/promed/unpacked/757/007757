Minnesota's first case of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) has been
confirmed in a horse from Blue Earth County, state Health Department
officials announced.
The illness, which is spread by mosquitoes, kills more than 90 percent of
the horses it infects, including the southern Minnesota horse. Although
relatively rare in humans, it can trigger fatal brain swelling, experts say.
While EEE has never been identified in Minnesota until now, it has been
occurring in western Wisconsin for many years, said Health Department
spokesman Buddy Ferguson. Since early July, for instance, at least 21
horses in portions of Rusk, Barron, and Chippewa counties have come down
with the illness. Most have died.
No Minnesotan has ever developed eastern equine encephalitis and only 3
Wisconsin residents have developed the illness in the past 30 years.
Despite this summer's outbreak in Wisconsin horses, no human cases have
been reported there this year.
As a precaution, Minnesota Health Department officials recommend people
living in south-central Minnesota avoid exposure to mosquitoes and remove
mosquito-breeding areas on their property. They also urged horse owners to
consult their veterinarians about having horses vaccinated against the
illness, even if the animals already were immunized this year.
Officials recommend residents use an effective insect repellent on clothing
and exposed skin, wear long sleeves and long pants, and keep window screens
repaired to prevent insects from entering homes. In addition, outdoor
activities should be avoided around dawn and dusk, when mosquitoes are most
likely to be feeding.
Because mosquitoes lay their eggs in water, residents can prevent them from
breeding on their property by removing or eliminating any objects where
water can collect and stand. This includes old tires, birdbaths, clogged
rain gutters, and children's toys.
Signs of horses infected with the illness include loss of appetite,
drooping eyelids and lower lip, aimless wandering and circling behavior,
blindness, and inability to stand. Death usually occurs in 2 to 3 days.
Healthy humans bitten by infected mosquitoes usually don't develop any
symptoms. But the elderly and those with compromised immune systems can
develop the illness. Symptoms include high fever, fatigue, aching muscles,
a stiff neck, and tremors or confusion. In severe cases, the illness can
trigger encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain, which can lead to
convulsions, coma, and death.
Health experts say fewer than 10 cases of human eastern equine encephalitis
occur in the US each year. The mortality rate ranges from 50 to 60 percent
and most survivors suffer severe brain damage.
