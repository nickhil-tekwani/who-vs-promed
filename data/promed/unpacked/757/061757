Feeding your pigs
------------------
New pig feeding regulations aim to mitigate the risk of foot and
mouth disease [FMD] and control the spread of other diseases, like
swine vesicular disease and classical swine fever.

From 7 Jul 2005, all food containing meat that is fed to pigs must be
heated to 100 Centigrade for one hour. The easiest way to comply
with the regulations is to boil meat and food waste containing meat
for one hour, stirring frequently.

Items that do not have to be heated to 100 C before consumption
include: commercially manufactured pig feed; food waste that does not
contain meat and has not been in contact with meat; and eggs, milk or
rendered material.

Although the risk of FMD or other serious exotic diseases infecting
New Zealand livestock through feeding of food wastes to pigs is low,
the consequences to farmers and the whole economy would be great.

Under the Biosecurity Act 1993, individuals found feeding
non-compliant food to pigs can be fined a maximum of $5000 [USD
3381]. Corporations in breach of the new regulations face a $15 000
[USD 10 148] fine.

The Biosecurity (Meat and Food Waste for Pigs) Regulations 2005 can

[The introduction of FMD (and other disease agents) into disease-free
countries through untreated animal products, such as meat and offal
from infected countries, being fed to pigs as "swill" or catering
waste -- is a notorious, long-known phenomenon. This route has been
also suspected to be the one by which FMD was introduced into the UK
in 1967 and 2001. One of the main recommendations of all 3 official
inquiries into the last UK FMD outbreak was: "Stringent checks on pig
swill operators to ensure food was being boiled for an hour to kill
off disease".

The EU has consequently tightened its own control upon such
practices, including new regulations. Though the chance of such
materials entering NZ is of a lesser magnitude than in Europe, the
new measure, most probably based upon a risk assessment, is to be
appreciatively welcomed. - Mod.AS]
