Canadian scientists use Olympics to study spread of infectious diseases
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
As an international crowd of athletes and supporters continues to gather en
masse in Vancouver, some Canadian scientists are using the Olympics as
their virtual test tube to find out how to prevent the outbreak of diseases
spread by air travel. Two projects in Toronto and Boston -- both led by
Canadians -- are tracking international flights to the West Coast city, as
well as an online database of worldwide diseases, in order to test a
sophisticated system that could one day prevent the spread of infectious
diseases.

"We haven't had, anywhere in the world, a system that is integrating global
movements of people through air travel with global infectious disease
surveillance through the web," said Kamran Khan, a doctor and scientist at
St Michael's Hospital in Toronto. Khan's project, called bio.DIASPORA, was
created 6 years ago and studies global air traffic patterns. To test the
way diseases might travel by air during the Olympics, it was combined with
HealthMap, a Boston-based project led by a Canadian doctor, John
Brownstein, which uses 30 000 sources to track diseases logged in "real
time" as they are reported online.

"Mass gatherings can amplify and disseminate infectious diseases around the
world," said Khan. "If that person-to-person spread occurs and as these
people return to the home cities and home countries, the epidemic may
actually go with them, so there may be new epidemics that are spawned in
other parts of the world."

For his part, Khan and his researchers discovered that about 2-3rds of all
international travellers attending the Olympics would be coming from a pool
of 25 cities across the world. In co-operation with the aviation industry,
they are able to analyze flight movements to understand how many flights
are arriving and departing in Vancouver. When combined with HealthMap, the
researchers hope to learn of potential outbreaks before they happen.
"There's a considerable untapped potential in focusing on prevention. Very
often, we focus our attention on responding to threats after they arise.
But I think there's really an opportunity for us to be thinking more about
preparing for threats before they occur," said Khan. "If we can understand
how the global community is interconnected, then we can understand how we
share risks in the world and how we might share responsibilities for
infectious disease threats."

Khan said the Vancouver experiment has shown any potentially infectious
diseases brought into Canadian to be under control. He said the projects
will also be put to use for other events, such as this summer's G20 meeting
in Ontario and the FIFA World Cup in South Africa.
