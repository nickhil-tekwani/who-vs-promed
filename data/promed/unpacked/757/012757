Romania said on Wednesday a meningitis epidemic ravaging poor
areas in the north had spread to over 1800 reported cases and
that it is considering delaying the start of the new school year.
Reported cases of viral meningitis, mainly linked to unclean water,
have risen from around 300 at the start of this month. A Health
Ministry statement said that most of the cases were mild forms of
the disease, which attacks the nervous system and the brain, and
were registered in northeastern regions, near the border with
Ukraine and Moldova.
The Education Ministry has yet to decide whether to delay the 1
Sep 1999 start of classes over the epidemics, which has affected
mostly children and young people in areas cut off from water
supplies.
Local health authorities said that foreign tourists were not at risk,
but warned them to observe prescribed hygiene rules.
Despite those assurances, Ukraine has warned its
citizens against visiting neighbouring Romania and
Moldova -- where more than 300 meningitis cases
were also registered -- to prevent the disease spreading.

[This is the same area around the Volga delta where a similar
seasonal outbreak in 1996 turned out to be West Nile fever, due to
West Nile virus carried by mosquitos (see refs. above). However,
the fact that most cases appear to be in children & youths argues
against a mosquito transmitted cause -- unless most adults are
already immune from previous outbreaks. Many different viruses,
including mumps, can cause viral meningitis, but they are not
usually waterborne, they are transmitted by contact. Presumably,
mumps vaccine coverage of the young population of Romania is
low or non-existent - Mod.JW
