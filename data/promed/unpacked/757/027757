Health officials on 25 Jul 2002 said a recent outbreak of illnesses
linked to human consumption of contaminated ground beef could widen
despite a massive recall of the suspect meat.
A total of 28 people in 7 states have fallen ill in the past 6 weeks
after eating ConAgra Foods Inc.ground beef products that were
contaminated with a potentially fatal strain of _Escherichia coli_
bacteria.
_E. coli_ O157:H7, typically acquired through contaminated food or
water, causes bloody diarrhea, vomiting and cramps. In severe cases,
usually involving the elderly and young children, it can lead to
anemia, kidney failure, and death. So far 5 of the victims in the
current outbreak have been hospitalized with a life-threatening
kidney condition, hemolytic-uremic syndrome.
Although ConAgra pulled nearly 19 million pounds of beef products
from the market, the second largest ground beef recall in US history,
CDC officials said some contaminated meat could still be circulating
among consumers.
"Ground beef can obviously be frozen for a long time and it is
possible that cases could occur on the order of months out," said Dr.
Paul Mead, a foodborne diseases expert with CDC.
The CDC noted that some consumers might not realize they were storing
contaminated meat, because ConAgra's products are sold to wholesalers
who then grind, repackage, and distribute the meat under different
labels.
Earlier this month, the Atlanta-based agency matched the _E. coli_
O157:H7 strain found in 18 of the victims in Colorado to a batch of
the recalled ConAgra ground beef products. In addition to the cases
in Colorado, illnesses linked to ConAgra beef have been confirmed in
South Dakota, California, Iowa, Michigan, Wyoming, and Washington.
Most victims reported eating ground beef purchased at local grocery
outlets.
Last month, Omaha, Nebraska-based ConAgra issued an initial recall of
more than 350 000 pounds of ground beef, one day after the US
Department of Agriculture confirmed that its inspectors had detected
_E. coli_ during routine testing. The recall was later expanded to
include an additional 18.6 million pounds of fresh and frozen ground
beef and trimmings.
Ground beef is made from trim, which is carcass remnants left over
after prime cuts such as steaks and roasts are removed during
slaughterhouse processing. Trim is often kept in 1000- to 2000-pound
lots.
Jim Herlihy, a spokesman for the company's ConAgra Beef Co. unit,
conceded that it had not been testing all its beef trimmings before
the recent _E. coli_ outbreak.
"When we first learned of the initial positive (_E. coli_ test) we
immediately began testing any beef trimming going into ground beef,
and on 11 Jul 2002 we began testing all beef trimmings being shipped
to our customers," said Herlihy, who added that the company was
confident that all its products were now safe.
Herlihy said ConAgra was continuing to consult with the USDA and was
working with a molecular biologist to review the company's procedures.
The CDC said the outbreak highlighted the need for consumers to thaw
ground beef in a refrigerator rather than at room temperature and
cook the meat thoroughly to an internal temperature of at least 160
degrees (71 degrees Celsius).
Washing hands, utensils, and surfaces that have come into contact
with raw or undercooked meat with soap and hot water also can cut
down on the risk of bacterial cross-contamination, the CDC said.
Foodborne diseases cause an estimated 76 million cases of
gastrointestinal illness, 325 000 hospitalizations and 5000 deaths
per year in the United States.

[Assuming that a significant amount of the potentially contaminated
ground beef is past the repacking and relabeling phases of
distribution, it is indeed likely that additional cases of this
potentially lethal infection may occur from consumption of the
ConAgra beef.
The number of cases can be minimized, however, by proper handling of
the uncooked meat, appropriate thorough cooking, and prevention of
contamination of food ready to be eaten by surfaces contaminated with
the meat prior to cooking. Antibiotic treatment of patients with
gastroenteritis caused by enterohemmorhagic E. coli is linked to an
increased risk of hemolytic-uremic syndrome. -Mods.LL & LM]
