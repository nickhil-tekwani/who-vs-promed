Fiji Medical Association President Mudaliar and Samoa's Acting Director of
Public Health, Dr. Namulauulu, were reported by the Apia Daily Post to have
said that an epidemic of a dengue-like fever with flu-like symptoms is
spreading on both island groups, perhaps tied to atmospheric conditions in
the region. Blood samples have gone to the WHO Arbovirus Reference Lab in
Brisbane, Australia. Results are expected in about 2 weeks. Neither the
number of cases or any mortality figures were supplied by the two
officials. However, Namulauulu said characteristics of the disease are
diverse -- gradual or sudden onset; mild influenza-type illness with
myalgia, fatigue and high fever or more severe cases accompanied by rash
and hemorrhaging.
