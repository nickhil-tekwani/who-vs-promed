NAIROBI - Three prisoners have died from a cholera outbreak in a prison in
Nakuru district of Kenya's Rift Valley Province, the Daily Nation newspaper
reported Saturday. The Ministry of Health has warned to close the prison
unless the sanitary conditions there were improved. The outbreak was first
detected on January 6 and another 34 have been admitted to hospital in the
past week, the ministry revealed. The 450 inmates and 789 remand convicts
occupy 14 cells, which constitutes a potential danger of contracting
cholera, the paper said. According to the report, 148 others were treated
and discharged after they complained of diarrhea and vomiting. An emergency
treatment center has been established to prevent the further spread of the
infectious diseases.

On 12 Jan 2000, the Minister of Health announced that an outbreak of
diarrhea was occurring in Mohale's Hoek district in the southern area of
the country. A team from the Ministry of Health was sent to the affected
area and was joined by an epidemiologist and water sanitation officer from
the WHO office. The WHO team visited the 2 health centers where most cases
had been reported and checked the records from January 1997 to 15 Jan 2000
which showed that the number of cases had risen beyond the expected
seasonal figures from November 1999 to January 2000. As of 15 Jan 2000 a
total of 1862 cases with 28 deaths had been reported and adults were more
affected than children. Problems identified were lack of protection of
latrines and inadequate water supplies. All unprotected water springs/wells
which were inspected were contaminated while most of the protected springs
had good quality water. Control measures were initiated which included
intensive health education and case management. Laboratory confirmation of
the causative pathogen and analysis of sensitivity to drugs is still
awaited. Currently the number of cases appears to be decreasing and the
Ministry of Health has sufficient medical supplies to deal with this
outbreak.

The first cases of cholera in Madagascar occurred in late March 1999 in
Mahajanga Province. Two other provinces, Antananarivo and Antsiranana, were
affected later in the year. By the end of November 1999, 6983 cases with
433 deaths were recorded with the majority occurring in Mahajanga Province.
In January, cholera was reported from a fourth province, Toliary, where the
first case was confirmed on 11 Jan 2000 in Morondava District. The rainy
season started in early December and 3176 cases with 121 deaths have been
recorded since then up to 10 Jan 2000. It is likely that a higher attack
rate will occur up to the end of the rainy season which continues until
March/April. The Ministry of Health is continuing to take appropriate
control measures.

Blantyre, Malawi - The rain that belatedly engulfed Malawi after several
weeks of dry spell has come with mixed blessings as cases of cholera
continue to increase. Dr. Habibie Somanje, controller of preventive health
services in the Ministry of Health and Population, said Saturday the
cholera preparedness committee set in urban areas to check the spread of
the disease has noted a marked increase in outbreaks following heavy reins
in the first week of January. "Cholera cases had decreased during the dry
spell but since the rains resumed, cholera numbers had shot up
dramatically" he said. Somanje said at least 362 cases of cholera had been
reported as of Saturday with the commercial city of Blantyre, registering
the highest cases of 122. This is followed by Lilongwe, the capital with 91
cases. The Ministry says major cities are recording high incidents of
cholera because of an increase in squatter settlements which do not have
adequate sanitation facilities.

A cholera outbreak has killed 9 people in the northern Nigerian city of
Kano, where Africa Nations Cup soccer matches are due to start next week,
local authorities said Monday. Kano Director of Public Health Services
Dayyabu Mohammed told reporters the outbreak had been brought under control
with the help of the international Medecins Sans Frontieres charity. "As I
am speaking with you, 115 cases have been reported while nine deaths
recorded," he said. Other state government officials said the outbreak
would have no impact on the soccer tournament since players and spectators
would be staying far from the parts of the city where cholera cases had
been reported. The first match of Africa's premier soccer cup planned for
Kano is between Egypt and Zambia next Sunday. Other members of the group
playing there are Senegal and Burkina Faso. The competition is to be
co-hosted by Nigeria and Ghana. Cholera outbreaks are not infrequent in
Nigeria and usually result from poor sanitation in slum districts of the
West African country of at least 108 million people.

At least 17 people have died of cholera in the Somali capital since the
weekend and many more lives are threatened, a doctor based in Mogadishu
told AFP on Tuesday. "Eleven people died in southwest Mogadishu and six in
north Mogadishu," Ibrahim Maow Gandhi said. Gandhi, who is the acting head
of Mogadishu's Joint Health Authority (JHA), said lack of drugs to fight
the highly infectious disease was responsible for the rapid spread of the
epidemic. JHA comprises doctors from both sides of the Somali capital,
which has been partitioned and ruled by different clan warlords since
dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was toppled in 1991. Appealing to Somali
businessmen to contribute to efforts to combat the epidemic, Gandhi
attributed the cause of periodic outbreaks of cholera in Mogadishu to poor
sanitation, lack of clean water and ignorance. "Please boil your water and
food, also clean your neighborhoods"; Gandhi appealed to the city's
residents. Cholera has also killed many people in central, northeastern and
southern Somalia regions since the disease emerged there in December,
several medical sources told AFP.

DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania - A cholera epidemic has hit certain parts of
Tanzania and at least one person was reported dead by the weekend. The
epicenter of the epidemic is the western region of Kigoma, which also hosts
thousands of refugees from conflict-ridden countries in the Great Lakes
region. A report by Kigoma health officials identified the dead as a
four-year-old boy, Ismael Hamis. The town's health officer, Katola Rajabu
Kibegwa, said 43 victims were currently admitted in various health centers.
He added that the epidemic was spreading fast through contaminated water
and lack of proper hygienic conditions. Kigoma suffered another epidemic in
1999 and the international NGO, Medicins Sans Frontieres, had to rush in
experts to stop the spread. Government resources are normally scarce and
cannot cope with the epidemic, which is endemic in Tanzania. But the
current epidemic pales the 1997 one, which was triggered by the heavy El
Nino rains. And every year since then, Tanzania has had cholera outbreaks.
Two years ago, the disease hit the country's commercial capital, Dar Es
Salaam, after the city's main water pipeline broke down. In just one week,
more than 1,000 people were taken ill. In 1997, a total number of 40,249
cases and 2,231 deaths were officially reported to the World Health
Organization. More than 11,512 cases were reported in 1999 and over 321
deaths registered. Doctors say the epidemic spreads fast in Tanzania
because victims live far from medical centers. At least 58 percent of the
Tanzanian population have no access to health services at all. There are
four doctors per 100,000 people in 1993 compared to Seychelles' with 104
and a Southern African Development Community average of 30. The European
Union has, therefore, through its humanitarian wing, begun funding a small
team who can respond quickly to medical emergencies, especially cholera.
The team works for Doctors without Borders - Spain (MSF), and consists of a
doctor, a water sanitation expert and a logistics expert. Once the team
hears of a cholera outbreak, it moves into the area fast to investigate. In
most parts of Tanzania, cholera strikes at the end of the dry season.

KAMPALA - Cholera has claimed a total of 2267 lives in Uganda since
outbreak in 1997, a report from the Ministry of Health said. The National
Cholera Task Force said in the report that 228 of the 2267 deaths occurred
in 1999 and 22 districts reported cholera in that year compared with 41 in
1998. Though 52 000 people have survived the disease, cholera persisted
because of poverty and poor hygiene that is the most
significant factor in the spread of cholera.

Nearly 500 people have died due to a lack of sanitation and medical care in
refugee camps in West Timor, officials said Wednesday. Most of the dead
were East Timorese children, who had fled their homeland after
pro-Indonesian militias went on a violent rampage following the
overwhelming vote for independence in a plebiscite in August last year,
said Samsudi, a government official in West Timor. Mr Samsudi said most
of the deaths in the past four months were caused by diarrhea and
dysentery. He said 150 000 refugees are still sheltering in camps in West
Timor. Despite efforts by international relief organizations, many are
still reluctant to go home. International officials and UN aid workers have
repeatedly complained that militia thugs were still operating in the camps,
preventing many of the refugees from returning.

The Salvadoran Health Ministry has reported 26 cases of cholera since 20
Dec 1999, a spokesman for the institution said Tuesday. Some 14 cases were
registered during the Christmas and New Year's holidays, most of them in
the province of La Libertad, which attracted hundreds of people to its
beaches. In the month of January 2000, 12 more people were diagnosed with
the disease, seven of them from the La Libertad province, the spokesman
added. Authorities have determined that poor hygiene in food preparation
was responsible for this recent outbreak. El Salvador's Health Ministry
reported its first case of cholera in August 1993.

Ahmedabad - At least three women, including a child, have died and about
1000 people were affected by gastroenteritis in the walled city areas in
the past one week. Health Minister Ashok Bhatt told news persons today that
the cause of the deaths and the epidemic was contamination of drinking
water supplied by Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) . Of the total
affected persons, 250 were admitted to the corporation-run Vadilal Hospital
while the rest were admitted to Infectious Diseases Hospital, I.G. Hospital
and a private minority run hospital in Jamalpur area of the city. The
patients were mostly from Jamalpur, Raikhad, Behrampura, Dani Limda, Lal
Darwaja and Khanpur areas of the city, who had complained of diarrhea and
vomiting, hospital sources here said. The state government, in consultation
with the civic authorities, has engaged about hundred teams of health
officials and doctors to undertake door-to-door survey of the affected
families to provide medical treatment on priority basis, bhatt said. A
correspondent, who visited the hospital, found a number of patients lying
on the floor. The Vadilal Hospital sources, however, denied there were any
deaths due to gastroenteritis.

An outbreak of dysentery was confirmed in November from samples collected
in the western area of the country caused by _Shigella flexneri_. On 29 Dec
1999, _Shigella dysenteriae_ type 1 (Sd1) was isolated in one of six stool
samples at the Institut Pasteur laboratory in Paris. Both strains were
sensitive to nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin. Two more cases of Sd1 were
confirmed on 19 Jan 2000 in Moyamba District (southern area) and Koinadugu
District (northern area). Reports from 6 Dec 1999 to 16 Jan 2000 provided
by the Ministry of Health give a total of 3094 cases of shigellosis with
132 deaths (CFR 4.27). The outbreak appears to be spreading and a rapid
epidemiological assessment of the situation is being planned through a WHO
mission to the affected areas.

After linking El Nino with illnesses such as malaria, cholera and dengue
fever, scientists now have connected the climatic phenomenon with an
increase in childhood diarrhea. The research led by the Johns Hopkins
School of Public Health also suggests for the first time that gradual
temperature increases related to global warming could foster outbreaks of
diarrhea in children of developing nations. Diarrhea kills as many as 3
million children under the age of 5 worldwide every year and sickens
millions more, mostly in developing countries.
The study of 57,331 children in Lima, Peru, found that an increase in
diarrhea cases between 1993 and 1997 was linked to even small rises in
temperature, regardless of whether it was summer or winter. In fact, the
effect was greater in winter, even though the weather was cooler.
