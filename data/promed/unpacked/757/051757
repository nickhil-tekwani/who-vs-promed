Rabies was confirmed as the cause of death in the 2-year-old child
who died in a Johannesburg hospital recently, one month after being
scratched by an unvaccinated, domestic puppy in Soweto. Laboratory
tests were conducted on post-mortem brain specimens at the National
Institute for Communicable Diseases and the Dept. of Anatomical
Pathology and were positive by RT-PCR and the fluorescent antibody test.

This is the 1st confirmed human case of rabies resulting from an
animal exposure in the Johannesburg (JHB) Metropolitan area. The
injury was relatively minor; rabies awareness is low in the area; a
health facility was not visited, and, consequently, the child did not
receive post-exposure prophylaxis.

This human rabies case coincides with a serious outbreak of rabies in
dogs in Johannesburg. As of Sun 3 Oct 2010, there have been a total
of 11 confirmed cases of rabies in dogs in the south western areas of
the Johannesburg Metropolitan area, predominantly in unvaccinated
domestic dogs. All isolates have been identified as canid biotype,
originating from KwaZulu province. The canid strain has never
previously been a problem in Gauteng.

Until this outbreak, the risk of rabies in JHB was very low, and,
therefore, there is limited awareness about what should be done to
prevent rabies disease in humans. Rabies vaccination of domestic dogs
and cats is, however, a legal requirement in South Africa, but
coverage is variable.

An extensive animal vaccination campaign was launched in May 2010
when the 1st dog cases were identified, and this is being coupled
with a campaign to raise the awareness amongst the population and
health professionals.

[ProMED-mail thanks Professor Lucille Blumberg and colleagues for
providing this confirmation that rabies virus infection was the cause
of death of the 2-year-old child in Johannesburg as a consequence of
a dog-bite one month previously.
