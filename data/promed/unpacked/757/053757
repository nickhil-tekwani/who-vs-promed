[1] ASF spreading in Southeast China

African swine fever [ASF] has spread to several southern Chinese provinces, with severe and swift outbreaks that have led to the culling of scores of pigs in a country that is considered to be the world's largest consumer and producer of pork. The disease was 1st detected in the northernmost regions of China in early August [2018]. The virus has now spread to Guangzhou City in Guangdong Province -- the southernmost province on the mainland.

According to a [25 Dec 2018] article by Hong Kong media Apple Daily, local authorities in Guangzhou culled more than 6000 pigs at a farm in Huangpu District, after local authorities temporarily put the owner of the farm and her dozen employees under house arrest at an unknown hotel. They were presumably detained to prevent the case from being publicly revealed [but, see comment 1].

Apple Daily journalists reported seeing workers with face masks operating manning excavators in Huangpu District, trying to bury the culled pigs. The intense stench of the dead pigs could be detected a few dozen meters away.

The female farm owner, a retired soldier who wasn't identified, had recently purchased the 6000 pigs from the nearby Guangxi region. It was determined that these pigs were infected with the virus because some of them had already died by the time they were shipped to her farm.

According to Apple Daily, the latest case in Guangzhou places the number of Chinese provinces, municipalities, and regions with known cases of the African swine fever at 23, with a total of 101 reported [outbreaks].

Guangzhou isn't the only city in Guangdong affected by the outbreak. According to Taiwanese media, 11 pigs died from the disease at a farm in Zhuhai City. And on [25 Dec 2018], China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said that at a pig farm in Huizhou City, 11 pigs died from the disease, while 11 others had been infected [see comment 1].

Chinese media also reported that a local food shipping company had been directed by the provincial government of Guangdong that all cross-city shipment of live pigs would be banned.

In nearby Fujian Province, the cities of Nanping and Sanming have recently reported cases of the outbreak, according to Taiwan's Central News Agency. At Sanming, 27 pigs reportedly died from the disease at a pig farm, with 27 others showing symptoms [see comment 2].

China has culled more than 630 000 pigs across the country since the outbreak was 1st reported in early August [2018], the provincial government in northern China's Hebei Province said during a press conference on [7 Dec 2018].

Lai Shiow-suey, emeritus professor at the School of Veterinary Medicine at Taiwan's prestigious National Taiwan University, said China could be underreporting the number of outbreak cases, given that there are roughly 430 million pigs in China. According to his estimation, the possible number of pigs infected could be well over 100 million, he told the Liberty Times newspaper on [22 Dec 2018].

Lai added that China had made a mistake by buying pork imports from Russia instead of buying from the United States -- owing to self-imposed tariffs enacted amid the Sino-US trade war. He explained that the genetic sequence of the virus found in infected pigs in Shenyang City -- the capital of northern China's Liaoning Province, where China's 1st case of ASF was reported -- was nearly identical to those found in Russia and Poland.

In August [2018], the scientific journal Science also reported the same genetic resemblance, which led the journal to conclude that the disease likely spread to China through meat imported from Russia.

[1. The 2 new outbreaks in Guangdong (Jingxia Village, Guangzhou and Hutou Village, Huizhou), were notified to the OIE in follow-up report No 1 from Guangdong, submitted [Wed 26 Dec 2018]; see at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=29047.

2. The new outbreak in Fujian (Yangkeng Village, Nanping), was notified to the OIE in follow-up report No 2 from Fujian, submitted [Wed 26 Dec 2018]; see at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=29049.

Both above reports include the same epidemiological comments as follows: "Based on the current situation and the diagnostic capacity of the laboratories of the provincial animal disease prevention and control center, the ministry of agriculture and rural affairs has authorized and stipulated qualified laboratories that meet biosafety conditions to diagnose the local African swine fever cases in the places where the epidemic has occurred".

The authorization of provincial laboratories to carry out the diagnoses of ASF reflects China's effort to improve the effect of ASF control and eradication activities by speeding them up. Previously, the needed emergency measures (eg. culling and movement ban) could be applied only if/when initial suspected cases were confirmed by a State reference laboratory. - Mod.AS]

[2] Taiwan: alertness, stiffened ASF-prevention measures upon entrance

As African swine fever (ASF) rages in China, neighboring countries such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, which have not yet been affected by the disease, are on high alert and doing everything in their power to prevent its spread. However, from time to time passengers have been caught attempting to bring meat products into the country, often claiming that they were not aware of the new regulations or that they thought vacuum-packed meat products were allowed, since they are not raw meat or perishable. In an interview last [Mon 24 Dec 2018], the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine attempted to explode such myths and the bureau hopes that by doing so people will more clearly understand the situation and not try to push their luck.

Statistics show that the passengers who have been fined are nationals from Taiwan, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand, as well as Vietnamese and Chinese spouses traveling on Republic of China (Taiwan) passports. They have been caught bringing in poultry and meat products from areas affected by animal epidemics such as ASF, foot-and-month disease and bird flu.

Despite the bureau's efforts to actively promote and raise awareness of ASF at the airports' departure and arrival areas, as well as showing videos on board to advise passengers not to bring in meat products, most passengers who were fined still said that they were "not aware of the regulations". Some even thought that as long as it was not perishable food or raw meat, it was OK to bring in processed and vacuum-packed meat products.

Preserved pork and sausages are meat products often imported illegally by passengers. The bureau's section chief Peng Ming-hsing points out: "In the past, once we caught passengers carrying in such items, we usually advised them and discarded the items without actually fining the passengers, which might have given the impression that these items were allowed to be imported."

On passengers' misconceptions, Peng stresses that: "Only canned food can be brought into the country. Others products are not allowed." Canned food also includes "soft can packaging", such as prepared food pouches within a pot of instant noodles. However, beef canned food for pets is not allowed to be brought into the country.

Peng pointed out that canned foods are prepared by using a high-temperature and high-pressure sterilization process, so they can be stored at room temperature without need for refrigeration or freezing, and as a result there should not be risk of them carrying diseases, viruses, or germs. Vacuum packaging only extracts air and so must be refrigerated or frozen, which means that the ASF virus can still survive -- and this is why vacuum-packed foods are disallowed.

In addition, in Taiwan there are many spouses from China and Southeast Asia -- they may miss the cuisine of their country of origin and therefore often try to find ways to import meat products into Taiwan. Peng also stressed that this is now completely banned.

[According to OIE's WAHIS interface data, China has reported, since early August 2018 and as of 26 Dec 2018, a total of 102 ASF outbreaks. This included 15 outbreaks in August 2018 and - in the following 4 months, September to December; 15, 30, 26 and 16 outbreaks, respectively.

Measures to prevent ASF dissemination from China are required there as well. A media report dated Thu 27 Dec 2018 (http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1133646.shtml) informed about the interception by customs, of 2 batches of ASF-infected hog feed, produced by Tianjin-based 'NP Proteins'. According to a statement released by General Administration of Customs, the 73.93 tons [81.5 US tons] of hog feed was originally from 12 packing houses in Tianjin; it did not specify the destination of the hog feed. The General Administration of Customs called for the examination of hog feed to be intensified and if any is found to have been infected with African swine fever virus, the material is to be sealed and its original source determined.

The administration warned livestock farms to check their source of hog feed exported to Hong Kong and Macao and conduct virus tests on porcine globulin powder, the alert reads.

From the statement, it is not clear if the information on the feed's infectivity was based upon tests of the 2 batches, identifying infectious material, or by its sourcing back to packing houses dealing with infected raw materials. It is also not clear what "export" from Tianjin stands for - to destinations outside China or to closer territories such as Hong Kong, Macao or other Chinese provinces.

Tianjin is one of China's 23 provinces already reported infected; its 1st outbreak (out of a total of 2) dates back to 10 Oct 2018 (20181015.6092539).

Information on the Tianjin-based 'NP Proteins', including an "Industrial Distribution map" presenting its products' destinations throughout China is available at http://www.chinabaodi.com/en/product/7.html.

According to FAO's risk assessment of ASF in China (March 2018; ref 1), China's pork production increased during the 1980s following market-oriented economic reforms. This very active production model showed a positive production and consumption balance in the 1990s. In the decade that followed, production consolidation began, environmental regulations were tightened, and destocking was initiated with the culling of 15 million animals by 2015. Swine owners profited greatly from high pork products prices and, given the opportunities for growth, modern, intensive swine farms developed rapidly. Corn quality and supply changes were additional drivers of the consolidation and, as a consequence, medium and small farms were closed due to non-compliance with the new standards or because of non-competitive production levels.

According to the said reference, China's hog farming in 2000 was composed of 74% 'backyard farms' (1-49 heads/farm), 21% 'specialized farms' (50-1000 heads/farm) and 5% 'commercial farms' (more than 1000 heads/farm). In 2015, following the significant changes, the figures became, respectively, 27%, 57% and 15%. This means that, given a population estimated at 500 million swine, the current number of backyard farms in China can still be counted in the millions (at least, 3 million). Prof. Shiow-suey's remark (item 1 above), saying that the number of ASF outbreaks in China (totaling 102 so far), could be underreported, sounds plausible. This could have been due to the difficulty in getting timely and accurate information from the many backyard farms.

Prof. Shiow-suey's remark about the possible Russian source of the Chinese event deserves attention as well. This issue was addressed in detail in 20180815.5967476. The countrywide spread of the virus in domestic pig farms, apparently without involvement of wild boar, supports this scenario. It would be interesting to note if and how many tests were applied by China's authorities in pork products upon arrival in China from Russia/East Europe, and what the results were.
