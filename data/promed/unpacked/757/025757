Bovine rabies was recorded last week in this area of the country. It is a
disease transmitted by [vampire] bats. San Onofre, Sheep and Coloso, Sucre
are the municipalities hardest hit.

The Colombian Agricultural Institute (ICA) reported the deaths of 11
animals as a consequence of vampire bats (_Desmodus rotundus_) biting
donkeys and cattle and passing on the virus (_Rhabdovirus_), which is lethal.

What is much more dangerous is that it can be transmitted to humans, for
whom the disease is also deadly, despite the treatments that patients can
undergo. So far, no human cases have been reported.

Faced with the notification made by the ICA in the department of Sucre,
officials of the Ministry of Social Protection and the National Institute
of Health traveled to the area to provide support to the Administrative
Department of Health.

According to the OIE (Office International des Epizooties; World
Organisation for Animal Health), rabies is a disease common in domestic
animal species such as dogs, cats, cattle and other species. It is
zoonotic, that is, it can affect humans.

The disease is transmitted when the bat bites cattle and/or other animals.
