Suspected Russian bird flu seen as no threat to humans
------------------------------------------------------
A disease discovered in poultry in Russia and suspected to be the country's
1st case of bird flu is unlikely to pose a threat to humans, a senior
Health Ministry official said on Friday [22 Jul 2005]. "The disease was
discovered some 10 days ago, and people who have since come into contact
with the affected birds have shown no symptoms of illness. And the flu
[would show] itself in one or 2 days," said Galina Lazikova, deputy chief
epidemiologist.
The Paris-based World Animal Health Organisation [OIE] said that the
Russian authorities had notified a suspected outbreak of avian influenza in
Siberia, but more tests were needed. The OIE said the Russian report said
some clinical signs indicated the outbreak was a type of avian influenza,
although some details -- no species specificity and the pattern of spread
-- were not typical of the disease.
It said the 1st signs of a disease were found in poultry in 5 villages in
Novosibirsk on 15 Jul 2005 and significant mortality detected by 18 Jul
2005. By 20 Jul 2005, more than 350 birds of various species (geese, ducks,
turkeys, chickens) had died. The Russian report said pathological material
had been sent for laboratory analysis and the results expected on Sat 23
Jul 2005.
On Thursday the Russian Emergencies Ministry reported that avian influenza,
strains of which can spread to people and can be fatal, had been detected
in poultry in a village in Siberia, but the country's chief veterinarian
could not confirm the news. "The reason behind the accident [incident?]
could be bad water, feed poisoning, Newcastle disease or avian influenza.
More investigation is needed," Sergei Dankvert, chief animal and plant
safety officer, told Reuters on Thursday.
The head of the Veterinary Department of the Novosibirsk regional
administration, Muhamed Amirokov, told Reuters on Friday specimens of dead
birds were being tested by several laboratories in the region and outside
it, and results could be expected in 3-4 days. "As of today we have no
proof that we have bird flu. What we have is a disease of unknown origin.
And we are keeping the situation under observation," Amirokov said. He said
no quarantine had been imposed in the region, although some "standard
restrictive measures had been adopted." He declined to give details.
Avian influenza virus is split into strains [serotypes] such as H5 and H7.
Both of these have the potential to be high or low pathogenic [in birds].
Of the H5 strain, there are potentially 9 different subtypes such as H5N1,
H5N2 and H5N3. The deadly strain of the virus that has struck Asia recently
is the high-pathogenic H5N1 type that can be transmitted to humans.
Lazikova said preliminary tests had shown that birds might have one of the
H5 type strains not dangerous to humans. Russia does not produce enough
poultry for domestic needs and imports over a million tons of poultry meat
annually, mainly from the United States, the European Union and Brazil.

[It has been reported since the above Reuters report that laboratory
testing has determined that the avian influenza virus that killed birds in
the village of Suzdalka in the Novosibirsk region is an H5N2 serotype avian
influenza virus and therefore not dangerous to humans. Alexander
Shestopalov of the Vektor State Research Center stated that: "This virus is
considerably less pathogenic for poultry than H5N1, which is found in
South-East Asia, and is absolutely harmless to humans."
Although H5N2 serotype strains have often been strains of low pathogenicity
in domestic fowl, it may be premature to conclude that the Siberian isolate
of H5N2 is harmless to humans. - Mod.CP]
