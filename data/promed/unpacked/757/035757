--------------------------------------------------------------
Malaria has claimed 154 lives and affected over 2.86 lakh [286 000]
people across the country. As many as 48 have died in Orissa alone,
where 84 309 people have been reported infected. Orissa is followed
by Meghalaya, where 33 deaths were reported and over 10 000 infected.

[Malaria is prevalent in India and probably underreported in many
areas, as indicated by the imported cases in tourists from Goa (see
ProMED-mail references below). - Mod.EP]

[According to information available on the Global Infectious Disease
and Epidemiology Network (GIDEON - see <http://www.gideononline.com>)

Two-thirds of all cases are reported from Gujarat, Karnatka, Madhya
Pradesh, Orissa, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab.
- Orissa, Assam & Maharashtra account for 80 percent of all
_plasmodium falciparum_ malaria.
- Malaria is reported nationwide, including Delhi and Bombay; but not
in Hichal Pradesh, Jammu & Sikkim, isolated coastal areas around
Western Ghats, Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
Transmission begins with the onset of the Monsoon seasonb in mid-June.
- _P. vivax_ predominates until August, with _P. falciparum_
infection rising to a peak in September.
- There is no risk for malaria at altitudes above 2000 meters.
Malaria was nearly eradicated from India during the early 1960's:

The statement that malaria was almost eradicated in the early 60s is
best demonstrated by the data in the next section, also from the
GIDEON database where numbers of annually reported cases were less
than 100 000 during the early 60s, but by the early 70s these numbers
were surpassing 1 000 000 cases annually each year. The above
newswire report of 286 000 cases this year attributable to malaria is
in contrast with the data presented below. More information from
knowledgeable individuals would be greatly appreciated.

Number of total cases reported per year 1961 through 2006:
1961 (49 151), 1962 (59 375), 1963 (87 306), 1964 (112 942), 1965 (99
