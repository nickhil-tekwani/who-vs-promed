CJD (new var.) 1985-1997 - UK 970507185250

The following is a report, in the Daily Telegraph of 4 February, of a
speech by Sir John Pattison to the annual meeting of the [UK National
Farmers' Union.

Fears of an epidemic of human brain illness arising from mad cow disease
were dismissed yesterday by the Government's scientific adviser.
Prof. Sir John Pattison, chairman of the Government's independent
Spongiform Encephalopathies Advisory Committee said new cases of BSE in
cattle were plummeting and cases of a related fatal brain illness in young
people were occurring only in low numbers. He told the annual meeting of
the National Farmers' Union of England and Wales in London that 1998 would
be a "turnaround year" for mad cow disease.
Only 23 cases of new variant Creutzfeldt Jakob disease had so far been
reported. Of these, three were recorded in 1995, 10 in 1996 and 10 in 1997.
It was this new variant of CJD which provoked the Government's warning
statement in March 1996 that sparked the beef crisis and the European Union
ban on exports of beef.
Sir John estimated that the number of deaths expected from the new variety
of CJD, which has been linked to BSE, would be far fewer than feared. Given
an estimated incubation period of between 10 and 15 years for nvCJD, he
expected cases to be somewhere between 100 and 1,500 - compared with up to
500,000 which some experts feared two years ago. He took the view that the
final total would be at the lowest end of that scale.
New cases of BSE in cattle were expected to fall from 4,197 last year to
1,741 this year, he said. These would fall to about 89 by 2000.
"I think the end of 1997 marked the bottom of the problem and we can only
go up from now," Sir John said. "I have no doubt that the BSE epidemic is
fast disappearing and that the number of new variant CJD victims is not
rising rapidly. As cases of new variant CJD remain low, this will
eventually mean that the whole problem of the regulations we have in place
will disappear altogether. I believe we will be saying over and over in
1998 that there is no threat from beef or beef products reared in the
United Kingdom." Sir John said.
Consumers, he said, had changed their views on beef over the past 12 months
and this was indicated by the critical reaction to the Government's
controversial decision to ban the sale of beef on the bone to protect
consumers from the slight risk of contracting CJD. But he defended Jack
Cunningham, the Minister of Agriculture, for deciding to ban beef on the
bone. Farmers and consumers had to understand that the Government's main
aim was to re-establish exports of beef which were so vital to British
farmers. Anyone in Mr. Cunningham's position would have found it difficult
not to take action to show Europe that everything possible was being done
to make sure that Britain's health and hygiene controls on meat were the
tightest in the world.
Sir John admitted after the meeting that some members of his committee were
more cautious than himself. "There is always a chance that the estimates I
have given are wrong. Some members are more cautious than I am."
***
I [Ralph Blanchfield share Sir John's assessment of the BSE situation.
The figures quoted in the report for nvCJD -- "three were recorded in 1995,
10 in 1996 and 10 in 1997" are of course taken from the 2 February
Department of Health statistical table. They may be a suitable basis for
annual statistical reports, but are a very misleading basis for considering
the trend of incidence. The calendar year of death is a very crude
timescale. On a shorter timescale one might note that there have been no
new cases in the past two months, and only two over the past six months.
However, as pointed out in the current IFST Position Statement on BSE, the
pattern so far assignable to the definite and probable cases over the
period 1994 to date varies greatly according to whether one works on the
basis of date of appearance of clinical signs (in cases subsequently
confirmed) or (as in the statistical table) on date of neuropathological
confirmation. Either way is a reasonable way of expressing the statistics
over this period, provided that the basis is clearly declared. But the
latter is not meaningful for assessing trends. LaBudde (1997) has analysed
statistically the dates (as best could be estimated) of onset of symptoms
in the nvCJD confirmed cases up to August 1997 and found that the
mean-time-between-cases appears constant at 7 cases/year up to that point,
with no evidence that the rate was increasing. However, neither way of
expressing the statistics provides a means for long term forecasting of
likely future incidence. This is because of the small number, unknown
variations in incubation time, the absence until now of a means of early
diagnosis, and variations in the duration from clinically-observed onset to
death/confirmation.
The incubation time is not only unknown, but, assuming the likelihood of a
causal connection, is likely greatly to vary inversely to the ingested dose
of BSE infectivity and the susceptibility of the individual.
I hope that Sir John is correct in his long-term nvCJD forecast. I would be
inclined to share it if the pattern of the past six months continues for
the rest of 1998 and into 1999. But for the present I think it is too soon
to forecast, and I share the caution of "some members of his committee".

[As I have a significant wager on the cumulative number of nvCJD cases by
April 15th, 2002, I take heart from Sir John's speech. It looks as though I
will win at a walk ... which is a matter of much wider celebration if it
turns out to be true. - Mod.MHJ
