A large outbreak in the UK of rabbit hemorrhagic disease, mostly in
southwest England and Wales, has killed thousands of wild rabbits and,
according to scientists, may be the biggest threat to them since the
myxomatosis outbreak of the 1950s.
The viral disease first appeared in Britain in 1992 in a domestic rabbit
and it is known to have spread to the wild two years later.
Dr. Roger Trout, head of the Rabbit-Wise Consultancy, said "We have never
suspected that rabbits are going to disappear off the face of the Earth
because of this virus. But it is going to wipe out anything from 20 per
cent to 70 per cent of local populations. If the disease continues to
spread more widely, then people - especially those living in rural areas -
are likely to find their domestic pet rabbits the focus of the disease."
Pet owners have been advised to get their animals vaccinated against the
disease, which has spread to 40 countries since it was first reported in
China in 1984. [It is not clear from this report whether 40 countries
includes Australia and New Zealand, which have released the virus (under a
certain amount of duress in some cases), as a rabbit population control
measure. - DP/PC
