--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
During 2018-2019, the Ohio Department of Health (ODH) reported 3 cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) [see footnote] in persons who worked in 2 food processing facilities. The National Tuberculosis Molecular Surveillance Center [see footnote] performed whole genome sequencing of a Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolate from each patient; phylogenetic analysis revealed the isolates were genetically identical. Prompted by concern for MDR TB transmission associated with these workplaces and surrounding communities, ODH began an investigation in February 2019. CDC was invited to assist with the investigation and deployed a team to Ohio on [14 Apr 2019].

The CDC-ODH team, which included representatives from CDC's Division of Tuberculosis Elimination and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), reviewed medical and employment records, conducted principal informant interviews, and conducted a tour of one of the facilities (facility A) where the 3 patients worked. The 3rd patient also worked at a 2nd facility (facility B), which had closed as part of an unrelated business restructuring before the CDC-ODH team could begin its investigation; facility A remained operational throughout the investigation. A separate NIOSH team had visited facility B before it closed to conduct a health hazard evaluation following notification that one the facility's employees had MDR TB; observations from that visit were used to guide the exposure assessment of facility B employees. The index case occurred in a person born in one of the 30 countries designated by the World Health Organization as having a high prevalence of MDR TB (1). According to available work schedules, during the index patient's infectious period, the second and third patients had worked for at least 54 days and 7 days, [see footnote] respectively, on the same food production line as the index patient. The investigation team was unable to find any other potential transmission venues or common exposures among the three patients.

No additional cases of MDR TB related to this group of patients were identified. However, 971 contacts of the three MDR TB patients were identified, including 941 who were workplace contacts; the majority of contacts were non-U.S.-born persons. Contacts were prioritized according to levels of possible TB exposure; 478 contacts, including 448 workplace and 30 personal contacts, had the highest risk of exposure (high-priority contacts). [see footnote] As of April 26, 2019, a total of 160 (36%) of the 448 high-priority workplace contacts had been tested for TB infection, 59 (37%) of whom had positive results for a tuberculin skin test or interferon-γ release assay test, both of which test for TB infection. Among those with positive test results, 19 (32%) began latent tuberculosis infection treatment (Table). Among the overall U.S. population, an estimated 21% of non-US-born persons have a positive tuberculin skin test in the United States, and 16% have a positive interferon-γ release assay result (2). The higher percentage of positive TB test results at the workplace provides evidence for likely workplace transmission. Based on principal informant interviews, likely contributors to the low level of TB testing and treatment for infection among contacts included difficulties in communication, perceived barriers to care, and mistrust of government authorities.

After the investigation concluded on [26 Apr 2019], all 3 patients with MDR TB disease had either recovered or were continuing to recover, and no additional cases have been identified. ODH continues to work with its local partners to facilitate TB testing and treatment of contacts with latent TB infection and to monitor for new cases.

MDR TB is rare in the United States (less than 3% of TB cases annually since 1993) (3,4); in 2018, there were 98 MDR TB cases in the United States out of a total of 9,025 TB cases (5). Although the TB transmission source for the index patient remains uncertain, the low prevalence of MDR TB in the United States and the absence of other genotype-matched TB cases in the national TB molecular surveillance database indicate that the patient was likely infected in the patient's country of origin. Given the nonspecific signs and symptoms of TB, health care providers should consider TB when examining persons with cough, chest pain, hemoptysis, weight loss, fever, chills, night sweats, weakness, fatigue, or loss of appetite, especially when the person has TB risk factors, including birth in areas with high rates of TB [see footnotes]. In addition, providers should consider prompt molecular detection of drug-resistance testing for TB patients with risk factors for drug-resistant TB [see footnotes]. Finally, public health agencies need to facilitate engagement with communities with higher rates of TB to build trust, which is important for successful disease investigations. Activities might include communicating in a culturally sensitive manner with community members, offering patients incentives for getting tested or treated, providing transportation to clinics, using mobile clinics, and conducting communitywide education efforts.

[Multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a form of tuberculosis caused by _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ resistant at least to isoniazid and rifampin, 2 cornerstone drugs used in the 1st-line TB treatment regimen. Extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) is a subset of MDR-TB that is resistant to isoniazid and rifampin, as well as resistant to fluoroquinolones and at least one of the 3 2nd-line injectable anti-TB drugs (amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin). Beginning in 2018, the National TB Molecular Surveillance Center performs whole genome sequencing (WGS) on isolates of _M. tuberculosis_ gathered from newly diagnosed patients in the United States (https://www.cdc.gov/tb/topic/laboratory/default.htm, https://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/infographic/pdf/tbWGS508.pdf).

Genotyping, when combined with epidemiologic data, can help identify persons with TB disease involved in the same chain of recent transmission, as was done in the investigation of the MDR-TB outbreak at a food processing facility described in the report above (https://www.cdc.gov/tb/programs/genotyping/chap4/4_combining.htm). However, details about the food-processing facility that could have facilitated TB transmission are not given.

MDR-TB may be primary or secondary. Primary MDR-TB is a new infection (in the absence of a history of prior treatment with anti-TB drugs) that has been acquired from someone with MDR-TB (that is, person-to-person transmission). Secondary MDR-TB is acquired as a consequence of the emergence of drug-resistant mutants during inadequate or improper use of anti-TB medications for active TB.

Primary drug resistance indicates need for better TB control to interrupt transmission, whereas secondary drug resistance indicates need for better patient anti-TB drug management to prevent the emergence of antimicrobial resistant mutants during drug therapy.

Transmission usually requires close, repeated or prolonged contact with a contagious individual in a poorly ventilated environment that occurs in households, homeless shelters, or other institutions, involving family members, flat-mates, close workplace colleagues, and acquaintances from common social activities with close and regular interaction. It is unusual for TB to be spread by casual, brief exposure. However, several reports posted previously by ProMED-mail from China and Singapore also have described outbreaks linked to the same residential community setting or use of the same public facility such as food markets (see ProMED-mail posts Tuberculosis, MDR - China: (Shanghai) primary, neighborhood outbreaks, 2009-2012 20161216.4702532 and Tuberculosis, MDR - Singapore (03): (AMK) linked to 2012 cybercafé outbreak 20160622.4302632, and Tuberculosis, MDR - Singapore (02): (AMK) neighbrhd outbrk, same genotp, 2012-16 20160619.4296808.) - Mod.ML
