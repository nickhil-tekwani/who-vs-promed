{NOTE: This was originally posted as Trichinellosis - Russia (Jotomirskaya).
A post was sent out (20041228.3429) with the following correction: Several
of our readers have pointed out that the region referenced in the original
report "Trichinellosis - Russia (Jotomirskaya)" archive number 20041228.3426
is actually in Ukraine. A more frequent spelling is Zhitomirskaya or
Zhytomyrskaya. ProMED-mail regrets the geographical error.}


4 cases of trichinosis are registered in Jitomirskaya region
-------------------------------------------------
4 cases of trichinellosis from swine have been registered in
Jitomirskaya region. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the
infection came from a pig raised in the village of Korostishko, and
the farmer had slaughtered the pig for private consumption. 11 people
shared meat from the infected pig, and 4 were hospitalized with
trichinellosis. Measures to prevent further spread have been taken by
the authorities.

[Pigs from small farms raised for private consumption do not always
undergo the legally required veterinary inspection. These pigs are
usually fed kitchen waste -- including meat -- and could be one
source of infection, as could small rodents. Trichinella is
widespread in Russia, and products such as sausages made from pigs in
backyard holdings and slaughtered for private consumption are not
always tested; consuming such products should be avoided. - Mod.EP]
