So far this year [2011] until the 27th epidemiological week, 187 cases
of malaria have been reported in La Guajira, and 95 of them are
located in the capital city (Riohacha), according to the Departmental
Secretary of Health. Most persons affected belong to the Wayuu
community, who were affected by the 1st outbreaks.

24 cases have been reported in La Cachaca I and II settlements, and
some additional cases have been reported in Argote, Puerto Caracol,
and El Horno communities. The most frequently reported symptoms were
high grade fever, nasal congestion, and chills. No fatal victims have
been reported until now.

According to the health secretary, the causes for this outbreak
affecting indigenous communities are water pools, brooks, and still
water pools that are used on a daily basis by indigenous people, and
these are the places where mosquitoes lay their eggs, easily
reproducing and afterwards biting people.

Indigenous communities request support from healthcare specialists so
that the outbreak will not spread and cause fatal cases.

A specialized group from the Health Secretary declared that diagnoses
are being made and interventions are being implemented and executed.
"We are performing control activities in indigenous communities and in
Riohacha slums. We are currently educating people, and we are also
fumigating the affected areas," said Mr. Wilmer Martinez, who is
currently in charge of the Health Secretariat.

[Maps of Colombia from PAHO showing the risk of malaria in different
parts of the country can be found at
http://www.paho.org/english/hcp/hct/malaria_pptindex.htm. The maps
are not dated, and thus it is unclear whether this is actual or
historic data.

The latest data on malaria in Colombia available from PAHO is from the
year 2007. According to this map, there is no risk of malaria in the
city of Riohacha and its surroundings, but there is risk south towards
the border with Venezuela. This area is near Venezuela, and the surge
in malaria in this area could be a local phenomenon or may represent a
surge across the border in Venezuela as well.
