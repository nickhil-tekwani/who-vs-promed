The first case of BSE has been reported by the Belgian Minister of
Agriculture on October 31, 1997 at 2:30 PM local time. The cow was sent to
the slaughterhouse on the 17th of September, but presented neurological
disorders, so it was discarded from the food chain. The head was sent to
the lab and the carcass has been destroyed. The [Belgian laboratory's
diagnosis of BSE has been confirmed by the British lab in Weybridge.
[The animal was a five and a half-year-old cow, born on the same farm from
which it was sent to the slaughterhouse. [Presently, epidemiological data
are not available, but an investigation is ongoing involving particularly
the cows of the same age on that farm. The farm is located in the province
of Namur.

[Thanks Vincent for passing this along. Is this an isolated case? As the
epidemiolgic investigation proceeds both on that farm and on surrounding
farms, please keep us informed. Any information from authoritative sources
would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.PC.
