Investigators from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) have
concluded their epidemiological investigation of the 50-month-old dairy cow
from Alberta diagnosed with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) on 13
Jul 2006. No part of the animal's carcass entered the human food or animal
feed systems.
The animal died of causes unrelated to BSE and would likely have lived for
an additional 4-6 months before the onset of BSE-related clinical signs.
This age range is not significantly different from that of previous
Canadian cases and indicates exposure to only a very low dose of BSE
infectivity. The detection of this case at the earliest possible moment
demonstrates the highly sensitive nature of Canada's national BSE
surveillance program, which targets cattle from the highest-risk
populations and has tested more than 117 000 animals since 2003.
Because the animal was exposed to BSE after the 1997 implementation of
Canada's feed ban, the CFIA placed priority on conducting a comprehensive
review of all potential routes of BSE exposure. In general, investigators
observed good levels of compliance with the feed ban at the farm, retail
and manufacturing levels. A particular incident was documented in one
commercial feed facility that may have permitted the contamination of a
single batch of cattle feed with prohibited material. The entire batch of
feed was shipped to the BSE-positive animal's farm. While the investigation
looked at all possible routes of exposure, this particular batch of feed is
the most probable source of infection. The CFIA has launched an enforcement
investigation.
In 2005, Canadian and American officials reviewed and confirmed the
effectiveness of Canada's feed ban. In addition, the surveillance program
continues to indicate that the feed ban has prevented the level of
infectivity in Canada from increasing. Nonetheless, the extremely small
infective dose of BSE means that even very limited opportunities for
contamination may permit periodic cases. The emergence of such cases is
common to almost every country reporting the disease. The enhanced feed ban
announced on 26 Jun 2006 will further limit potential BSE spread.
Potentially harmful cattle tissues -- which are currently prohibited in
feeds for cattle, sheep, goats and other ruminants -- are being banned from
all animal feeds. This action prevents more than 99 percent of potential
infectivity from entering the top of the animal feed chain, thereby
addressing any downstream contamination that could occur.
The animal component of the investigation traced 172 cattle born or raised
on the same premises as the positive animal. Using Canada's cattle
identification system, the CFIA fully accounted for all but 8 of these
animals and located 38 live cattle. Most of these animals have been
humanely euthanized and incinerated. The remainder are under quarantine and
will be destroyed once calving or harvesting of genetic material, as
allowed by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), is complete.
A complete summary of the investigation is available on the CFIA's website.
