Kayunga under cattle quarantine
-------------------------------
Kayunga district authorities have imposed a quarantine on cattle
movement following an outbreak of foot and mouth disease [FMD]. The
director for production, David Mugabi, on Wednesday [17 Dec 2008]
said more than 100 head of cattle had died since the disease broke
out early this month [December 2008].

The affected sub-counties are Galiraya, Bbaale and Kayonza. "We have
imposed a ban on the movement of cattle and their products from the
affected areas in order to contain the epidemic from spreading to
other sub-counties," he said.

Mugabi said he had informed the agriculture ministry about the
outbreak and the need for drugs to treat the disease.Mugabi said the
disease might have spread from the neighbouring districts of
Nakasongola and Kamuli.

"We have alerted the Police to arrest anybody found moving animals
and their products. They will be charged accordingly," he said.

Mugabi urged farmers to report cases of the disease to the veterinary
doctors. He also warned people against eating animals that have died
of the disease.

[FMD seems to have spread from the south-central Mukono district,
where it was reported in Aug/Sep 2008 (see 20080812.2499,
20080903.2760) northwards into Kayunga. In January 2008, FMD was
reported from the south-western Isingiro district, on Tanzania's
border. Uganda's districts are presented in the map at
<http://www.coetzee-uganda.com/index_files/image3181.jpg>.

The area has 32 Dairy farms, 60 Ranches and 10 dual-purpose farms,
and estimated resident livestock populations of approximately 55 000
cattle, 11 000 pigs, 31 000 goats and 5000 sheep; see at
<http://www.kayunga.go.ug/overview/agriculture.htm>.

According to the data of the World Reference Laboratory (WRL) for FMD
at Pirbright, the disease is endemic in Uganda, with the following
serotypes identified (in brackets, year of last occurrence): O
(2007), A (2002), C (1971), SAT1 (1999), SAT2 (2002), SAT3 (1997;
only in African buffalo).

The WRL further states that "all 3 SAT types are probably endemic in
the African buffalo population."

The last sample submitted from Uganda to the WRL-FMD was derived from
cattle on 24 Apr 2007. The results of the sequencing of this strain,
found to be topotype EA-2, are included in the Molecular Epidemiology
Report of 9 Aug 2007, available at
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2007/WRLFMD-2007-00021-Uganda-O.pdf>.

According to Uganda's semi-annual and annual OIE reports for 2007,
FMD was present in the administrative units Arua, Kaberamaido and
Kasese, but no quantitative data were included. The 1st semiannual
report for 2008 is not yet available. Data on the serotype(s)
involved in the current outbreak has been requested in previous
postings; the request is being repeated.

We would also like to know if the warning against the consumption of
"animals that have died of the disease" is based upon suspicion of
other disease agents or just upon regular food-hygiene
considerations. - Mod.AS]
