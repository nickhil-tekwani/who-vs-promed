As many as 20 train passengers, including children, were admitted to the Thrissur General Hospital on [Tue 24 May 2022], with symptoms of food poisoning. They were traveling in Maveli Express from Mookambika to Thiruvananthapuam. All were discharged after receiving treatment.

The passengers, belonging to a single-family, were returning after a dance arangetam (the debut on-stage performance of a former student of Indian classical dance and music) program at Mookambika. According to the passengers, they had consumed food bought from the Mangalore railway station.

[It appears to be a short trip between the 2 cities. This suggests a short incubation illness such as staphylococcal enterotoxin illness or heavy metal ingestion although the incubation period between the meal and onset of illness is not specifically stated. Both present primarily with vomiting without fever.

Foods that are frequently incriminated in staphylococcal food poisoning include meat and meat products; poultry and egg products; salads such as egg, tuna, chicken, potato, and macaroni; bakery products such as cream-filled pastries, cream pies, and chocolate eclairs; sandwich fillings; and milk and dairy products. Foods that require considerable handling during preparation, and that are kept at slightly elevated temperatures after preparation, are frequently involved in staphylococcal food poisoning.

A very short incubation of a vomiting-associated illness (less than one hour) also suggests that the etiology might have been heavy metal ingestion. A number of metals can cause this type of syndrome, which is usually caused by the ingestion of a liquid that had been kept in a metallic container. These metals include antimony, copper, tin, and zinc. The illnesses are usually self-limiting and require only symptomatic care. In addition to vomiting, other clues may include the liquid being described as having a metallic taste. Identifying the specific cause requires analysis of the food or liquid vehicle. Some potential differences in the illnesses exist between causes, including a longer incubation period (several hours) for zinc; vomiting and diarrhea for tin; and blue or green vomitus for copper. Other chemical toxins can also produce this syndrome of illness. - Mod.LL
