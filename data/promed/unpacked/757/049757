I make no claim to expertise in veterinary (or any other) virology, but
there are papers both ways on the relation of Canine Parvovirus (CPV) to
Feline Panleucopenia Virus (FPV). Briefly, CPV seems to be less specific in
infectivity range while FPV is relatively selective for cats. A search of
the US National Library of Medicine (via Internet Grateful Med,
http://igm.nlm.nih.gov/) gave 77 hits in English on "Canine Parvovirus", 11
of which, by their abstracts, discuss relationships.

[This is true NOW. However, when CPV1 initially emerged, it was canine
specific. In the genetic drift that has occurred since, CPV2b (the
currently infective and widespread strain of CPV) can infect both dogs and
cats. That is probably why the literature is confusing on this point. My
grateful appreciation to Alice Wolf, DVM, of Texas A&M University College of
Veterinary Medicine, for this information - Mod.TG
