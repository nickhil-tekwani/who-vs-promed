United Kingdom
2) OIE Western blot; - VLA hybrid Western blot; - review of SVA

Other details/comments:

scheme. As soon as the suspicion was raised due to the positive rapid test,
the herd was put under restrictions.
Final report: no.

[It is not surprising to see the very rare, isolated case of BSE in a cow
in Sweden. Identification of a cow with BSE simply indicates that the
surveillance system is identifying positive cows, just as it should. The
epidemiologic investigation results will be instructive, hopefully. - Mod.PC]
