[There have been several follow up reports concerning Zika virus infection posted on ProMED-PORT in Portuguese, since the last post in English. The following are reports to bring the Brazil Zika cases up-to-date. - Mod.TY]

The Ceara Health Secretariat (SESA) confirmed at least 10 cases of Zika virus (ZIKAV) in the state. This information was issued on Thursday afternoon (25 Jun 2015), through a technical note on the agency's website. According to SESA, the confirmations were made through testing of 14 samples by the Instituto Evandro Chagas (IEC), in Belem (Para state).

There were 55 samples collected and sent to IEC; 50 of them from residents of Fortaleza. As of now, 14 samples are processed, with 10 of them confirmed [positive] for Zika virus. Ceara, like the other states of the country, awaits official orientation by the Ministry of Health for implementation of Zika fever surveillance.

[The confirmation of the 1st locally acquired Zika [virus infection] in Ceara state is not at all surprising, rather it is predictable. The state adds to a list that increases weekly (see previous posts).

However, if the circulation of Zika virus for the country as a whole, as we have pointed out in post after post, stands as a challenge to more (not simple at all) surveillance of diseases that present with rash, for the state of Ceara the situation is much more complicated: the state lives with virtually uninterrupted measles transmission since 2014 and control measures have shown to be not effective enough to stop the circulation of the virus, including in the state capital, Fortaleza.

Considering the similarity of clinical case definitions between suspected cases of measles and those of Zika virus [infection], both diseases include fever, rash, and conjunctivitis. Early identification of suspected cases and the decision to initiate control actions or [epidemiological] blockade for measles, including vaccination, but above all, social withdrawal and the adoption of respiratory precautions (in waiting rooms of health services, for example), is the most challenging task (and potentially inglorious). In this scenario, there are qualitative limitations (such as no specific serology) and quantitative limitations (such as the small number of licensed laboratories, the reduced capacity to process a large number of samples) for laboratory investigation of suspected cases of Zika [virus infection]

Limitations to investigate (confirm or discard) suspected Zika fever cases (that may be, in reality, cases of measles or dengue, for example) in Ceara, certainly make the surveillance of diseases with rash more difficult, and consequently compromise, to a certain degree, efforts to interrupt measles transmission in that state, or could increase at any moment the risk of dissemination of this disease to other Brazilian states or to other countries -- already not improbable. - Mod.RNA

The dilemma for clinicians will be deciding which treatment is best when the diagnosis -- Zika versus dengue, versus chikungunya virus infections -- is uncertain. The dilemma for those responsible for disease surveillance is knowing which of these viruses is circulating when and where, in the absence of reliable laboratory confirmation. - Mod.TY]

On Tue 22 Jun 2015, Pernambuco confirmed the 1st 4 cases of Zika virus [infection], transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_, the same mosquito that transmits dengue [viruses]. According to the bulletin issued by state Secretariat of Health (SES), the confirmations were all in Recife Metropolitan Area, with 1 woman in Jaboatao dos Guararapes, 2 men in Olinda, and 1 child in the state capital [Recife].

The Zika virus [infections] were confirmed by the Instituto Evandro Chagas (IEC), the reference laboratory located in Belem [Para state]. Pernambuco sent 11 [samples] for testing, of which 7 were discarded [negative for dengue virus infection or other etiologies? - Mod.RNA]. The reported cases in the state occurred in the 1st 15 days of March [2015]. The patients had red spots on their bodies, fever, itching, and pain in the eyes, joints, and body, symptoms that are also characteristic of dengue [virus infection]. Currently, another 36 samples are under investigation in the IEC laboratory.

Recently, dozens of patients were diagnosed with Zika virus [infections] in Rio de Janeiro state, which registered its 1st case of Zika virus [infection] at the end of last month [May 2015].

The Subsecretary of Health Surveillance of the State Health Secretariat, Alexandre Chieppe, explained that with laboratory confirmation of the case that occurred at the end of May [2015], it is possible to state that circulation of the virus exists in Rio. According to him, there is no reason to alarm the population. It is not a disease with compulsory case-by-case reporting. "It is a disease that is of little clinical seriousness. There have not been any reports of serious cases or deaths in Brazil. The only purpose of reporting is to alert the health services that there is circulation of the virus. Our concern is about differential diagnosis [between Zika, dengue, and chikungunya virus infections]," stated Chieppe.

[Mod.RNA has clearly identified the problems and challenges that the appearance of Zika virus in Brazil presents for health providers and officials in that country. It is very likely that the virus will spread throughout the Americas, where vector mosquitoes are abundant and dengue viruses are transmitted. Inexpensive, reliable tests are needed to support rapid accurate differential diagnoses of Zika, dengue, and chikungunya virus infections.
