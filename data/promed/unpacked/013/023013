Avian Influenza A (H5N1) Virus Infection - WHO Update 19
----------------------------------------------------
Investigation of possible human-to-human transmission in Viet Nam: new data
are reassuring
---------------------------------------------------
WHO has today received the results from studies of 2 viruses taken from
members of a family cluster of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection in
Viet Nam. The family cluster has been under investigation as the 1st
possible instance of limited human-to-human transmission of the avian
influenza A (H5N1) virus outbreak strain. Virus genetic materials from 2
fatal cases in this cluster ­- sisters aged 23 and 30 years ­- have now
been fully sequenced by the Government Virus Unit of Hong Kongs Department
of Health. Both viruses are of avian origin and contain no human influenza
genes.
This finding, which indicates that the virus has not changed to a form
easily transmitted from one person to another, is consistent with earlier
findings from epidemiological investigations. No illness has been reported
in other family members, in the local community, or in health workers
involved in care of these patients.
China (poultry)
---------------
Chinese authorities have today confirmed H5N1 infection in poultry in an
additional province. The H5N1 strain was detected in samples from infected
chickens at 2 farms in the southern province of Jiangxi.
Altogether, H5N1 infection in poultry is confirmed or suspected at farms in
13 of Chinas 31 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities.
No cases of human H5N1 infection have been reported in China to date.

[It is reassuring to know that there has been no reassortment of avian and
human influenza virus genes in virus isolated from individuals among whom
person-to-person transmission was suspected. However, this is not
definitive proof that person-to-person transmission has not occurred. In
the preceding post in this series, the results of analysis of the structure
of the haemagglutin protein of the 1918 pandemic influenza virus led to the
conclusion that mutation alone is sufficient to explain the acquisition of
human transmissibility. - Mod.CP]

[2] Comment on N1 cross-protection
Date: Fri 6 Feb 2004
From: Edwin D. Kilbourne <ekilbourne@snet.net>

Comments on the Immune Response to Influenza Virus Neuraminidase
---------------------------------------------------
[As part [2] of the ProMED-mail post archived as "Avian influenza, human -
East Asia (05) 20040128.0332", Dr. Danuta and colleagues raised the issue
of the possible protective role of the N1 component. The following
comments have been received from Prof. Ed. Kilbourne.]
Dr Skowronski and her colleagues make an interesting and valuable
suggestion when they point out the relative youth of the lethal cases of
avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infections associated with the current
epizootic influenza in Asia affecting domestic fowl. They suggest that
older members of the human population may have been spared because of their
immunity developed through past infection with human H1N1 viruses, and
therefore their possession of antibodies to the N1 protein of the virus. As
one who has spent over 30 years investigating the immunizing potential of
influenza virus neuraminidases (NA's) I find this to be a reasonable
suggestion, and I strongly agree with Skowronski and colleagues that it
should be investigated further.
In contrast to the neutralizing, infection-preventing antibody induced to
the major antigen of the influenza virus -- the hemagglutinin (HA),
antibody to the NA is infection-permissive, yet disease-suppressive, and it
has been repeatedly demonstrated in experimental animals that this effect
results from partial suppression of virus load over a wide range of
antibody concentrations.
There is epidemiologic evidence that the impact of the H3N2 1968 pandemic
was blunted by pre-existing encounter of humans with the N2 NA in the H2N2
decade following the pandemic introduction of H2N2 virus in 1957.
What is the relevance of all this to the H5N1 virus problem?
Just this:
(1) Perhaps none or very little. It is already known that within NA
subtypes, as is the case with HA subtypes, there may be considerable
variation in gene sequence and antigenicity from year to year, although the
evolutionary rate of NA antigenicity is slower than that which occurs with
the HA.
(2) On the other hand, the basis of subtype classification is antigenic
similarity, so that some cross-protection is to be expected.
(3)Therefore, it is imperative that the antigenic and cross-protective
relationships between the N1 of H5N1 virus and those of recent or present
human vaccines be rapidly determined. A protective or ameliorating vaccine
strain -- although less effective than the desired "perfect match" H5N1
vaccine now being sought -- may be already on hand (in the form of an H1N1
vaccine) for the blunting of infection below the point of lethality in both
humans and birds and would allow boosting infection by wild-type
virus. There appears to be no immediate prospect of an acceptable, tested
H5N1 vaccine.
Although probably justified on a statistical basis, the euphemistically
termed "culling" of chicken flocks is a primitive method of what falls
under the rubric of environmental sanitation, and is no substitute for the
modern approach of disease control represented by vaccination.
