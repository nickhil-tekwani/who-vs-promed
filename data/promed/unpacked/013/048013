West Nile virus kills horse in Wakefield, Rhode Island
------------------------------------------------------
The first sign that mammal-biting mosquitoes in Rhode Island are carrying
the West Nile virus surfaced yesterday, when state officials announced that
a horse in South Kingstown had contracted the disease. The discovery is the
state's first evidence of the virus in mosquito species that bite human
beings. Until now, officials had found West Nile virus only in dead birds.
State environmental officials said the results were not a surprise because
they follow a pattern in other states of the virus emerging first in birds
and then in mammals. Last fall, some 20 horses fell ill with the disease on
Long Island, and 9 died. Last week, a horse with the virus in Bedford,
Mass., showed severe neurological symptoms and was euthanized.
The infected horse, which had been stabled on Saugatucket Road in
Wakefield, had fallen ill with symptoms of a neurological disorder. A local
veterinarian referred it to the Tufts University School of Veterinary
Medicine, in Massachusetts, where it was put to death on 28 Aug 2000. A
brain-tissue sample was sent to a U.S. Department of Agriculture veterinary
lab in Ames, Iowa. The lab notified the Rhode Island environmental agency
of its preliminary suspicions on Friday, and of its final results yesterday.
State officials said the horse hadn't been anywhere but South Kingstown in
the past year, meaning that it contracted the virus there. The stable is in
a rural stretch of the town, between Routes 1 and 108, covered with open
fields and farmland. State officials would not disclose the exact location
of the stable or the name of its owner, citing concerns about privacy.
"This simply confirms what we had every reason to believe was true -- that
at some level, we hope a low level, West Nile virus is now in mosquitoes
that do bite people," said Malcolm J. Grant, the associate director for
natural resources at the state Department of Environmental Management.
Local officials are planning to spray parts of South Kingstown and northern
Narragansett with the pesticide Sumithrin starting at 7 tonight.
West Nile virus, which was first detected in the United States a year ago,
crossed into Rhode Island last month. Since then, 4 birds have been found
with the disease, and officials have sprayed sections of Cranston, Warwick,
East Providence, Westerly, Middletown and Newport. There are plans to spray
a section of Coventry tonight. The disease is spread by mosquitoes, which
carry it in their salivary glands and pass it to other animals when they
bite. Because a number of mosquito species bite only birds, there was at
least a theoretical possibility before now that the disease had not spread
to mammal-biting mosquitoes. However, state officials said yesterday that
human infections were by no means a certainty, naming Massachusetts as a
state where a horse was afflicted but humans have not gotten sick.
Despite the discovery of the infected horse, scientists have yet to find
any infected mosquitoes [among the thousands they have been trapping since
Jun 2000 -- a paradox that continues to [mystify state officials.
Officials suspect that the number of infections in Rhode Island is now
peaking and will begin to diminish as the weather cools and mosquito
populations dwindle. State officials recommended insect-proofing stables,
applying repellents, and keeping horses stabled from dusk to dawn, when
mosquitoes feed. Researchers have found that cats and dogs are extremely
unlikely to become ill from the virus. "People shouldn't be worried about
their pets, unless their pets
happen to be horses," said Grant, of the State environmental agency.

[Mosquitoes that transmit West Nile virus between birds prefer to feed on
birds, those that feed on mammals, including man, prefer to feed on
mammals. Some mosquitoes are not fussy. Finding the virus in a horse shows
that the virus has got into a mosquito species that is not fussy, i.e., the
level of risk to humans has increased. Horses with West Nile virus
typically show symptoms of anorexia, depression, listlessness, fever, and a
range of other problems, from aimless wandering to paralysis of the lower
lip. There are no documented cases of the disease spreading from horse to
human, or from horse to horse. In humans, West Nile virus can cause fever,
headache, rashes and swelling of the lymph glands. In more serious cases,
it can lead to encephalitis. According to the federal Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, the virus is fatal to humans in 3-15 percent of
cases, most involving the elderly and others with weakened immune systems.
