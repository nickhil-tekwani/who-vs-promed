State officials say Tennessee's 1st confirmed case of eastern equine
encephalitis (EEE) this year [2008] has been reported.

The state departments of Agriculture and Health are urging horse
owners to protect the animals from mosquitoes and to review
vaccination records for the encephalitis and other mosquito-borne
diseases including West Nile virus.

State veterinarian Ron Wilson said outbreaks of viral encephalitis in
horses are a seasonal occurrence due to the prevalence of mosquitoes
in late summer and early fall.

Several states have reported cases of EEE in horses this season.
Tennessee's 1st confirmed case of 2008 was reported last week in
Carroll County.

The disease can kill up to 90 percent of the horses infected with the
virus. Humans cannot contract these viral infections directly from
infected horses.

Wilson said horse owners should be aware of signs of EEE and consult
veterinarians if a horse develops signs associated with this group of diseases.

[The virus responsible for EEE attacks the central nervous system of
a horse. Onset is abrupt, and horse cases are almost always fatal.
Signs include unsteadiness, erratic behavior and a marked loss of
coordination. There is no effective treatment for horses, and
seizures resulting in death usually occur within 48-72 hours of an
animal's 1st indications of illness.

There is an effective vaccine available for horses. It is generally
coupled with that for West Nile virus. Consequently, horse owners
could protect their animals from more than one disease at the same time.

Mosquitoes transmit the disease to horses and humans, but horses
cannot transmit the virus to people.

Birds, including ostriches and emus, may be affected by the virus.

Human cases of EEE are very rare. The disease, however, produces
serious illness when it is contracted via mosquito bite, and the
probability of recovery is less than 50 percent. In overt cases, the
virus produces an illness that begins with low fever, headache and
stiff neck. As the disease progresses, the patient can fall into coma
with death as a likely outcome. Recovery is possible, but individuals
that do recover usually do so with brain damage. Children appear to
be more susceptible to overt cases than adults. Research indicates
that most humans that are bitten by infected mosquitoes abort the
infection in the early stages and recover with no evidence that they
ever had the disease.

According to the CDC website information on EEE, there were
approximately 220 confirmed cases in the US during the period
1964-2004, averaging 5 reported cases per year, with a range from
0-15 reported cases each year. The states with the largest number of
reported cases are Florida, Georgia, Massachusetts, and New
Jersey. EEEV transmission is most common in and around freshwater
hardwood swamps in the Atlantic and Gulf Coast states and the Great
Lakes region. Human cases occur relatively infrequently, largely
because the primary transmission cycle takes place in and around
swampy areas where human populations tend to be limited. - Mod.MPP]
