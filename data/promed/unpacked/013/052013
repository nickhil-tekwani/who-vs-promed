Washington State: Franklin County Case Diagnosed as St. Louis encephalitis
--------------------------------------------------
Preliminary tests by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) have identified a Franklin County man's illness as infection
with St. Louis encephalitis virus. If confirmed, it would be the
first identified case in Washington state in more than 30 years. The
man, in his 30s, became ill in mid-May 2003, was treated as an
outpatient and is now recovering.
Last week the state Department of Health and the Benton-Franklin
Health Department announced the man had tested positive for a
mosquito-borne illness that was being classified as a suspect West
Nile virus case [see: West Nile virus, human - USA (Washington):
suspected 20030601.1334]. Since then, tests at the state Health
Laboratories have been negative for West Nile virus, and preliminary
tests results from the CDC have identified the illness as St. Louis
encephalitis. St. Louis encephalitis virus has many similarities to
West Nile virus. The illness is not spread person to person; it is
transmitted by mosquitoes that become infected by feeding on infected
birds. People cannot get the infection directly from birds or other
animals.
"These new test results don't change our recommendations about
mosquito bite prevention," said state Health Officer Dr. Maxine
Hayes. "Much like West Nile virus, St. Louis encephalitis is spread
by mosquitoes. The best way to avoid these illnesses is to take steps
to prevent being bitten and reduce mosquito habitat around your
home." Infection with St. Louis encephalitis virus has symptoms
similar to those caused by West Nile virus. Mild infections often go
undiagnosed; symptoms include fever and headache. More severe
infections have symptoms that include headache, high fever, neck
stiffness, and disorientation. There is no treatment or vaccine
available for St. Louis encephalitis. People who become ill are
treated with supportive care.
According to the CDC, there were 4478 confirmed cases of St. Louis
encephalitis in the United States between 1964-1998. Only 3 of those
cases were in Washington state -- the last in 1972. The most recent
outbreak nationally was in New Orleans, Louisiana in 1999, with 20
reported cases.
"Just because it looks like this is not a West Nile virus case, we
can't let our guard down," said Benton-Franklin Health Officer Dr.
Larry Jecha. "Last year [2002] our state had positive West Nile cases
in birds and horses, and we expect to see human cases this summer.
Besides, protecting yourself from mosquito bites will limit your
chances of being infected with West Nile virus or St. Louis
encephalitis."
