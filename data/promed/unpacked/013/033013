New Suspected Meningitis Cases
-----------------------------------
A total of 9 people with suspected meningitis are reportedly being
treated at the Onandjokwe Lutheran Hospital, The Namibian has learnt
from reliable sources. Health authorities did not want to confirm or
deny the report yesterday. "What I am sure of is, that apart from the
3 old cases that were reported in Onandjokwe Hospital earlier, there
are 6 new cases, but there might be more than that even," said a source.
Another reliable source who informed The Namibian about the new cases
could not say which villages the patients were from. "Yes, I received
a report of alleged new meningitis cases at Onandjokwe, but I was
also informed that these alleged cases of meningitis have still to be
investigated and verified to determine whether they are really
meningitis or not," the Permanent Secretary of Health, Kahijoro
Kahuure, told The Namibian late yesterday afternoon [4 Sep 2007].
When approached for comment, hospital superintendent Dr. Fillemon
Amaambo told The Namibian that he was busy with a meeting. The matron
of the hospital, Monika Shilongo, referred the reporter to the
Onandjokwe Hospital's chief administrator, Julius Mtuleni, and the
control register nurse, Penina Akudhenga. Both of these officials
referred questions to the Director of Health, Maria Kavezimbi, who in
turn referred the reporter to the Permanent Secretary of Health and
Social Services.
Last Wednesday [29 Aug 2007], the Regional Councillor of Eengodi
Constituency, Walde Sheyavali, announced on the NBC's Oshiwambo radio
service that several cases of the disease had been reported at
Onamakulikwa and Ohambala villages in Eengodi Constituency that week
and that he had asked the Onandjokwe health workers to go and
familiarise themselves with the situation. At that time Matron
Shilongo at the Onandjokwe Hospital said they were treating children
from Onamakulikwa, Ohambala, Onkumbula and Ohashipepe villages for meningitis.
She said a boy from Omakunde village died of the disease at the
beginning of last month [August 2007]. Matron Shilongo also said then
that health workers had been sent to those villages to investigate
the disease and give information to the villagers. Regional Health
Director Kavezimbi had confirmed to The Namibian that 3 children were
then being treated for meningitis at the Onandjokwe Hospital.

[A prior outbreak of meningitis that was presumed to be due to the
meningococcus at the time was reported in a ProMED posting in 2000
(Meningitis - Namibia (North) 20001214.2182). For a discussion of
meningitis in Namibia, please see that report. ProMED requests
further information on the current outbreak [including identification
of the strain involved].

Namibia is nowhere near the ill-famed bacterial meningitis belt of
Africa -- see map above -- but nevertheless reports a few cases
nearly every year. - Mod.JW]
