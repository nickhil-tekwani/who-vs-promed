[The 1st outbreaks of LSD in Russia were recorded in 2015, in the North Caucasus Federal District in the Republic of Dagestan, Chechnya and North Ossetia, bordering on Azerbaijan and Georgia, where the situation was favorable for the spread of the disease. Gradually, the virus moved to the east, and in 2018, disease outbreaks were recorded in the Ural and Siberian Federal Districts (Chelyabinsk, Kurgan and Omsk oblasts). The number of registered outbreaks of the disease varied depending on the year and were determined to be 17; 313; 43 and 64 in 2015; 2016; 2017 and 2018.

The current event started on 20 Jul 2019 in the Siberian Federal District (in Russia's Asian territories), spreading eastwards. Since its start in late May 2019, in Saratov (20190730.6594432), it has already caused 27 outbreaks, reaching the Altai Kraai: a distance of about 2500 km. The outbreaks have been reported from 6 primary administrative regions, namely (from west to east; in brackets, number of outbreaks) Saratov (5), Udmurtia republic (1), Tyumen (7), Novosibirsk (6), Omsk (7) and Altai (1). A (Russian) map, presenting the 27 outbreaks since July 2019, published by Russia's federal veterinary authorities (FSVPS), is available at http://fsvps.ru/fsvps-docs/ru/iac/2019/maps/10-21/nd.pdf.

All reports submitted to the OIE are linked in the event's summary, including an interactive map, at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=31229.

OIE's updated (29 Oct 2019) summary:
Total outbreaks = 27 (submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Cattle / 5041 / 175 / 1 / 13 / 2

Visiting the maps, the concentration of Russia's outbreaks along Kazakhstan's long northern border becomes remarkable. Kazakhstan's most recent report, addressing LSD, dates back to November 2016.

Both countries apply preventive vaccination against LSD. According to Russia's annual OIE report, 11 590 500 vaccinations were applied in 2018. Kazakhstan's 2018 report presents 2 395 211 vaccinations.
