Ms. Joyce Bagina, Metropolitan Health Director, told the 3rd Ordinary Meeting of the 4th Session of the 6th assembly that so far 86 suspected cases [of cholera] were recorded from Ahenkofi, Sekondi, Kwesimintsim Zongo and new Takoradi. She said New Takoradi continued to record lots of cases despite the public education and awareness creation by health promotion officers and community health nurses.

In a related development, the Waste Management Department of the Assembly has directed that all public places of convenience be cleared and disinfected. Mr. John Goker-Mier, Head of Waste Management, said evacuation of liquid and solid waste was currently ongoing in some areas of the Metropolis.

[2] Cholera - Niger (southern regions)

Niger has seen more than 1300 cases of cholera since the beginning of 2014, with 51 people dying of the disease, the United Nations said on Monday, 27 Oct 2014.

In September 2014 alone, there were 38 reported deaths from cholera, said the UN's Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in the capital Niamey on its website. The spike in the number of cholera deaths was due in part because of heavy flooding, which has inundated Niger since June 2014.

Steps are being taken "to contain the illness" and "prevent it from appearing in new places," said the OCHA, noting that cholera has broken out in 4 of Niger's 8 regions.

Of special concern is the southeast region of Diffa, where, since 2013, about 105 000 people have taken refuge, fleeing from the deadly attacks in Nigeria by the Islamist group Boko Haram and the crackdown by the Nigerian army. Many refugees have settled on the islands of Lake Chad, "where access to drinking water is limited, and the conditions of hygiene and sanitation are precarious," the UN office said.

[3] Cholera - West Africa

West Africa is struggling to control a cholera outbreak that has spread from Nigeria to nearby countries, exacerbated by insecurity and waves of refugees fleeing an Islamist insurgency in the country's north, aid agencies said. Some 33 000 people in Nigeria and thousands more in neighboring nations have contracted the disease, which has been overshadowed by an Ebola outbreak in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, medical charity Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF), said.

Cholera is an acute diarrheal illness caused by bacteria that can cause rapid dehydration and death. Its victims are frequently infected through the ingestion of water and food contaminated by human feces.

"In the past, we've seen a few big isolated outbreaks, but this year [2014], there have been lots of smaller outbreaks spread over a larger area, making it much harder to control," Cristian Casademont, MSF's operational health advisor, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by telephone from Barcelona. "Part of the reason is the unusually high and uncontrolled number of cholera cases in Nigeria. This, combined with the large movement of nomadic tribes and refugees between Nigeria and neighboring countries, could explain the disease pattern."

An insurgency in the north of Nigeria by Islamist militants Boko Haram has exacerbated the problem. The conflict has resulted in more than 2000 deaths in 2014 and forced more than 100 000 refugees to flee to Niger and Cameroon, according to Human Rights Watch.

Casademont said the conflict is making it more difficult to conduct surveillance and react to outbreaks in northern Nigeria and across the border in Niger's Diffa and Lake Chad regions. "The situation is getting more and more complicated," he said, noting that the number of people infected is likely to be much higher than reported.

Cholera has killed about 50 of the more than 1350 infected in 2014 in southern Niger, according to the United Nations.

In Cameroon, more than 2000 people have been infected in 2014, and about 100 have died, according to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.

The cholera outbreak has been compounded by poor harvests in southern Niger that have forced locals and refugees to go to Lake Chad in search of food, said Karl Steinacker, the UN refugee agency's (UNHCR) country representative in Niger. Tahoua is Niger's worst affected region, reporting more than 500 cases in September 2014, but the Diffa and Lake Chad areas are also a concern. "Lake Chad has become a point of last hope but also a health hazard. From a food point of view, they can survive off fish; however, there is no drinking water or sanitation," Steinacker said by telephone from the Niger capital Niamey.

Cholera is transmitted through bacteria-contaminated food and water or poor hygiene and often breaks out when there is overcrowding and a lack of access to clean water, trash collection and proper toilets. The United Nations estimates there are 34 000 displaced people living around the numerous islands of Lake Chad in need of water purification and about 2000 latrines, but security is hampering assistance. "If you get sick, you have to travel by boat to the nearest health centre in Bosso ... but as Boko Haram operates on the lake, it is out of bounds for most humanitarian agencies," Steinacker said.

MSF is working with Niger's government to improve cholera surveillance and control. The Red Cross and UNICEF are distributing chlorinated tablets in the Diffa region.
