Since July 2015, 7 patients from Eastern Africa presenting with febrile disease to various health care facilities in Munich, Germany, were found to have visible spirochetes in the blood smear.

Further molecular analysis with PCR techniques and sequencing conducted at the Max von Pettenkofer Institute for Medical Microbiology and the National Reference Centre for Borrelia (NRZ) could confirm _Borrelia recurrentis_ as the causative agent in 5 of these patients; in 2 patients, samples were taken after starting antibiotic treatment.

Louse-borne relapsing fever (LBRF) caused by _B. recurrentis_ is transmitted [by] the body louse in crowded and unhygienic conditions. LBRF can be a severe disease and [case-fatality] rates in untreated cases have been reported to be as high as 40 percent.

All patients diagnosed in Munich have been treated successfully with doxycycline or ceftriaxone (in one case). Mild to moderate Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction [inflammatory reaction observed after antimicrobial treatment of several infectious diseases] occurred in most cases.

All patients have been young male refugees and asylum seekers originating from Eastern Africa. However, the exact focus and place of transmission is not clear since most of the patients had complex travel histories and some indicated travel durations longer than the maximal incubation period of LBRF.

Healthcare and lab workers should be aware of LBRF in travellers and asylum seekers who come from or recently travelled through endemic countries, especially Ethiopia, Somalia, Eritrea, and Sudan. Exact microbiological species confirmation is complex, therefore within Germany, suspected samples can be sent to the national reference centre for differentiation.

[We thank Drs. Loescher, Wieser and Fingerle for this report. The following has been extracted from my moderator comments in ProMED-mail post Louse-borne relapsing fever - Netherlands: asylum seekers, ex Eritrea 20150731.3549645:

Relapsing fever is a bacterial infection caused certain species of the spirochete _Borrelia_. These organisms are able to periodically change their surface protein molecules to evade the host's immune response, thus causing a relapsing illness. Following an incubation period of about 7 days, the illness is characterized by recurring episodes of high fever, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting, each episode lasting several days, followed by a several-day asymptomatic interval. There may be up to 3-4 recurrences. Complications may include involvement of the lungs (ARDS; acute respiratory distress syndrome), central nervous system, spinal cord, eyes, heart, and liver. The bacteremia is intense (more than 10 000 organisms per ml of blood) during febrile episodes, which allows detection of organisms on a Wright-Giemsa stained blood smear. Thick blood smears are more sensitive than thin smears.

There are 2 types of relapsing fever: Tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF) and louse-borne relapsing fever (LBRF). LBRF is more severe than TBRF, with case-fatality rates without antimicrobial treatment of 30 to 70 percent in outbreaks. TBRF occurs in the Western hemisphere, Africa, Asia, the Mediterranean region and the Middle East. In the western United States, TBRF is usually associated with sleeping in rustic, rodent-infested cabins in mountainous areas. In the United States, 3 species, _Borrelia hermsii_, _B. parkerii_, and _B. turicatae_, transmitted by the bite of soft-bodied ticks (genus _Ornithodoros_) cause TBRF. A recently discovered _Borrelia_ species, _B. miyamotoi_, has been found in hard-bodied ticks (_Ixodes_) in regions where Lyme disease is endemic.

LBRF is caused by a single species, _B. recurrentis_, transmitted through abraded skin when the body louse is crushed during scratching. LBRF is endemic in Ethiopia, Sudan, Eritrea, and Somalia. Outbreaks are found in developing regions affected by war and in refugee camps characterized by overcrowding and poor personal hygiene. While mammals and reptiles may serve as a reservoir for tick-borne _Borrelia_ species, humans are the only host of _B. recurrentis_.

Treatment of relapsing fever consists of either a tetracycline (such as doxycycline), a macrolide (such as erythromycin), penicillin, or other beta-lactam antibiotics (such as ceftriaxone). LBRF can be treated effectively with a single dose of the antibiotic (http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/137/5/573), whereas treatment of TBRF requires 7-10 days to prevent relapse.

When initiating antibiotic therapy, all patients should be observed for a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. The reaction, caused by massive release of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and other cytokines, is manifest by a worsening of symptoms with rigors, tachycardia, sweating, hypotension, and high fever, occurs in over 50 percent of cases. The Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction can be fatal. Pretreatment with anti TNF-alpha antibody has been found to suppress Jarisch-Herxheimer reactions (http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199608013350503). Corticosteroids and antipyretic agents have little or no effect (http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/137/5/573 and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6132178), whereas meptazinol, an opioid agonist-antagonist, has been reported to reduce the severity of the reaction (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6132178). Treatment of the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction with intravenous fluids and vasopressors to maintain adequate blood pressure may be required.

According to the European Union (EU), around 185 000 people applied for EU asylum for the 1st time in the 1st quarter of 2015 and about 73 000 applications were submitted in Germany; also at the time, Germany accounted for over half of the approximately 500 000 pending applications for asylum (http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/6887997/3-18062015-CP-EN.pdf/4457b050-26f9-4cf1-bf27-9ffb73ff8c7b). Almost 3000 of the asylum seekers in Germany had citizenship in East African countries (Eritrea and Somalia) (http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/6887997/3-18062015-CP-EN.pdf/4457b050-26f9-4cf1-bf27-9ffb73ff8c7b).

Munich, the capital of the German state of Bavaria, is the 3rd largest city in Germany, after Berlin and Hamburg, with a population of around 1.5 million; it is located in southeastern Germany (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich). - Mod.ML
