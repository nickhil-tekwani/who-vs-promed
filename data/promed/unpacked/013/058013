First case of bluetongue disease in the summer of 2008
------------------------------------------------------
The 1st case of bluetongue for the summer of 2008 has been detected
in a sheep in the canton of Jura. This involved a
yet-to-be-vaccinated sheep. The case is not surprising, since during
the recent few weeks, cases of bluetongue occurred in animals within
bordering areas in Germany and France [for France, see regions 26 and
90 in the map, item 2. - Mod.AS]

The clinical changes in the affected sheep in the canton of Jura are
manifested by temperature, swollen head, and inappetence. The entire
flock of sheep and goats is now locked and monitored, and all animals
have now been vaccinated.

Following the 1st Swiss case, recorded in October 2007, bluetongue
disease has affected in Switzerland 15 animals on 8 farms.

A large number of animals have already been vaccinated in
Switzerland; this case illuminates the value of vaccination.

[It may be assumed that this outbreak has been caused by BTV serotype
8, but a laboratory confirmation is expected.

BTV-8 was declared by Switzerland as endemic on 12 Mar 2008; for a
summary of last year's (2007) outbreaks, see OIE's (World
Organisation for Animal Health) report, including a map, at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=6390>.

For the differential diagnosis of bluetongue in ruminants,
subscribers are referred to the excellent, illustrated review:
Williamson et al: Differential diagnosis of bluetongue in cattle and
sheep. In Practice, May 2008; 30: 242-251.

(In Practice is published in conjunction with The Veterinary Record.
It provides continuing educational material for veterinary
practitioners. Reviews by experts in their field cover all species,
but principally farm and companion animals, providing a regular
update on clinical developments. Published 10 times a year). - Mod. AS]

The Directorate General of Food, Bureau of Animal Health, has issued
a press release dated Paris, 14 Aug 2008, stating:

"The confirmation of new cases of bluetongue BTV-8 due to the viral
circulation in 2008 in the Departments of Ardeche, Aube, Ille et
Vilaine, Haute Marne, Morbihan, Pas de Calais, Haut Rhin, and Savoie
have caused extensions of the interdicted perimeters.

"The confirmation of new cases of the BTV-1 in the Landes and the
Pyrenees Atlantiques have caused a modification of the perimeter zones.

"The updated list of the regulated communes will be sent to you by post.

"5091 cases of BTV-8 in 2008 have come from the viral circulation in 2008.

"28 new cases of BTV-1 have come from the viral circulation in 2008.

For information: 15 569 cases of BTV were declared in 2007 (3 cases
of BTV serotype 1)

For information: 6020 cases of BTV declared in the first 6 months of
2008 (6 cases of the BTV-1) came from the viral circulation of 2007.

[In view of the 2 statements above, "5091 cases of BTV-8 in 2008 have
come from the viral circulation in 2008" and "6020 cases of BTV
declared in the first 6 months of 2008 (6 cases of the BTV-1) came
from the viral circulation of 2007": what is the final accurate
number of BTV-8 outbreaks, which are in fact attributed to new
infections, namely to recent the circulation of the virus during 2008?!

As remarked earlier (see AFSSA's [France's Food Safety Agency]
contribution in ProMED-mail no. 20080703.2027 and the moderator's
commentaries there, as well as in postings 20080719.2195 and
20080808.2441), the precise quantitative data pertaining to the
number of BTV-8 outbreaks in France during 2008 remain, at least for
this moderator, somewhat ambiguous.

In the attached map (updated 15 Aug 2008), the red dots stand for
"outbreaks of BTV-8 due to virus circulation during 2008", and the
blue dots for "outbreaks of BTV-1".

What is the difference between a case ("cas") and an outbreak
("foyer")? A clarification will help. - Mod.AS]
