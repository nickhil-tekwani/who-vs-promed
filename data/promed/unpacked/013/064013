We would like to inform you that on 21 Mar 2014, our diagnostic laboratory at the Animal Health Trust (AHT) in Newmarket, United Kingdom confirmed a positive case of equine influenza on a premises in Bedfordshire, UK.

The diagnosis was made following a positive qRT-PCR assay performed on a nasopharyngeal swab sample taken from a horse presenting with clinical signs. The affected horse was a 4-year-old unvaccinated Irish sport horse that showed clinical signs of fever and a dry cough. The mare had recently arrived from Ireland, where equine influenza had previously been reported this year [2014] (http://www.aht.org.uk/icc/Interim_Report1_february14.html).

Virus isolation and characterisation is currently underway at the AHT; details will be made available at http://www.equiflunet.org.uk as soon as possible.

[Equine influenza is caused by 2 subtypes of influenza A viruses (genus _Influenzavirus_ A of the family _Orthomyxoviridae_): H7N7 (formerly subtype 1) and H3N8 (formerly subtype 2); however, there have been very few reports of H7N7 subtype virus infections in the last 30 years.

In fully susceptible Equidae, clinical signs include pyrexia (fever), nasal discharge, and a harsh dry cough; pneumonia in young foals and donkeys and encephalitis in horses have been described as rare events. Clinical signs associated with infection in dogs also include fever and a cough; occasionally, infection results in suppurative (pus-forming) bronchopneumonia and peracute (sudden) death.

Characteristically, influenza spreads rapidly in a susceptible population. The virus is spread by the respiratory route and indirectly by contaminated personnel, vehicles, and fomites. The incubation period in susceptible horses may be less than 24 hours. In partially immune, vaccinated animals, the incubation period may be extended; one or more clinical signs may be absent, and spread of the disease may be limited. This makes clinical diagnosis of equine influenza more difficult, as other viral diseases, such as equine herpesvirus-associated respiratory disease, may clinically resemble a mild form of influenza. Horses infected with equine influenza virus become susceptible to secondary bacterial infection and may develop mucopurulent nasal discharge, which can lead to diagnosis of bacterial disease with the underlying cause being overlooked.

Despite the occasional identification of seropositive persons with occupational exposure, there is currently little evidence of zoonotic infection of people with equine influenza.
