[These statistics are "as of" 9 Dec 2014 for Sierra Leone and Guinea but only 7 Dec 2014 for Liberia, so that the change is 176 new cases and 143 new deaths in 2 days. And these are widely acknowledged to be underestimates.

Mod.JFW comments as follows on the ProMED/EAFR (Anglophone Africa) list re: the WHO sitrep of 10 Dec 2014 (http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/145198/1/roadmapsitrep_10Dec2014_eng.pdf):

"Progress continues to be registered in optimising the current outbreak response activities to match the scale of the outbreak in the 3 West African countries with intense transmission. Full access to laboratory testing is now assured in all affected districts and improvements have been registered in isolating Ebola suspect cases and conducting safe and dignified burials for Ebola victims.

"Contact follow-ups range from 84 percent in Sierra Leone to 96 percent in Liberia. As a result, cases are reported to be on the decline in Liberia, though a slight increase has been reported in Guinea, while Sierra Leone continues to report increasing trends. Additionally, transmission remains high in urban centres with Sierra Leone and Monrovia accounting for a significant proportion of new cases in their respective countries. The other concern relates to the lack of case management facilities and resistance by communities in the Northern Sahelian zone in Guinea with the risk of further spread to Mali. These concerns therefore need to be prioritized to ensure steady progress towards containing transmission in the 3 counties.
