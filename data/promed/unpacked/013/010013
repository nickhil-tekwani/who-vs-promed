This is a new version of my message regarding Ballina virus in
Australia. Now the text should be acceptable. Sorry for the delay,
but now in Baghdad [it] is not so quiet.
[The first version was unreadable - Mod.JW]
The report about Ballina virus and bats from Australia only supports
the hypothesis that Rhabdoviruses have many more wild hosts than we
previously expected and that nature contains different strains having
varying virulence, but for which it is not necessary to create a new
nomenclature (Australian bat lyssavirus, Pteropid lyssavirus, Ballina
virus).
There is evidence of the [existence] of rabies strains which
produce chronic, nonlethal infection of host animals and which, in
rare cases, might affect human beings after a very long incubation
period. In the Arctic Regions of the Former Soviet Union we observed
atypical rabies where the reservoir of infection was polar/arctic
foxes (_Alopex lagopus_). The various strains/sub-strains of
rhabdoviruses which circulated among these animals differed in
virulence, serologically and genetically, but all of them had the
same immunological antigens. Traditional postexposure treatment
against rabies gave good results.
When human beings (trappers, animal-lovers, vets) were exposed to
sick animals they caught disease not only through bites, but through
injured skin and conjuctiva. Usually the incubation period was very
long ( from 6 months to 2-3 years) and CNS signs, like encephalitis,
occurred. Unfortunately, many cases have been underdiagnosed and the
statistics for such cases are not reliable.
After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the epizootic surveillance
system [also] collapsed, but you can find information on this issue
at the Ivanovsky Research Institute (Gamalei str.16, 123098 Moscow).
Additionally, very strange strains of rabies-like viruses were found
among polar rodents, including lemming (_Lemmus lemmus_), but reports
do not mention that the causative agent was other than rabies.
A similar situation can be found in South American and Pacific Island
strains. All these strains are quite different but, nevertheless,
they are rhabdoviruses, and the name and clinical manifestation of
such disease was rabies.
