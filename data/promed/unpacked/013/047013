Manitoba: Total of Equine West Nile Virus Cases Reaches 101
------------------------------------------------
In Manitoba 65 additional horses have been identified as positive for West
Nile virus. We are in the process of notifying municipalities. More
detailed information will follow tomorrow. This brings the total number of
horses identified with West Nile virus to 101.
In Manitoba, the virus also has been found previously in birds of the crow
family, geese, ducks, sentinel chickens, an owl, and mosquitoes.
There have been no human cases of West Nile virus diagnosed in this
province. The risk of illness for any individual remains low. New
populations of mosquitoes are less likely to be infected at this time of
year. However, Manitobans should continue to take steps to protect themselves.

[This report confirms that equine cases of West Nile virus infection have
been diagnosed now in 3 (Ontario, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan) of the 4
provinces (Quebec being the exception) of Canada where the virus has been
recorded in 2002. The actual number of cases diagnosed may reflect local
variations in surveillance practice, rather relative intensity of the
outbreak. The number of cases in Manitoba, however, are substantial and
increasing rapidly. - Mod.CP]
