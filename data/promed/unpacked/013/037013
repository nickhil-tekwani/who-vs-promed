East Asia: True Toll of Avian Influenza Outbreak Remains a Mystery
--------------------------------------------------
While early reports of the deadliness of human avian influenza suggested
that about 90 percent of the victims died, there are growing signs that the
disease's true death rate is much lower -- although still high enough to
kill many millions of people if the worst fears about its spread come to
fruition. Few acute infectious diseases have death rates exceeding 5 or 10
percent. Exceptions are rabies, which is nearly always fatal, and Ebola and
Lassa fever, with reported death rates ranging from 25 to 90 percent. The
death rate for garden-variety flu for children, the elderly or the immuno-
compromised is less than 1 percent in developed countries. At least 20
million people worldwide died in the 1918 influenza pandemic, with an
estimated death rate of 2 percent.
As of yesterday, the death rate from A(H5N1) avian influenza in Southeast
Asia was 67 percent: 46 deaths among 69 confirmed cases reported from
Cambodia (1), Thailand (17) and Vietnam (51), according to the World Health
Organization (W.H.O.). The death rate for avian influenza is dwindling
because it is easier to count people who die than those who may become
infected and have minor symptoms, or none at all. This phenomenon of
subclinical disease -- a mild case of the bird flu, as it were -- seems to
be occurring with more frequency than previously appreciated. For instance,
the virus was detected in a healthy 81-year-old man in Vietnam and in a few
others who barely knew they had been ill. If mild or asymptomatic cases are
missed, the death rate will be skewed to falsely high levels.
On the grimmer side, other findings indicate that human avian influenza
infections may be more widespread than initially suspected and possibly
transmitted by feces. The virus was found in a child with severe diarrhea
and encephalitis, but no respiratory symptoms, leading health officials to
ask doctors to consider testing feces for A(H5N1) virus more often.
The bottom line is that more human avian influenza may be around than once
suspected, but fewer people who get it become gravely ill and die than
initially predicted. That, however, is an oversimplification. Establishing a
death rate for a disease like bird flu is a moving target for medical
detectives. Obtaining an accurate death rate depends on many factors,
including the ability of people to get health care and the quality of the
laboratory testing for the A(H5N1) virus. Each step in the process must go
right to get an accurate death rate, and that is difficult enough to attain
in the United States. The problems are multiplied in poor countries with too
few trained technicians and inadequate laboratory facilities. Also, a true
death rate depends on governments' honesty to overcome fears about losses
from decreased tourism and trade to report all cases. Health officials
credit aggressive journalists in Vietnam for reporting more and timelier
information about bird flu than t!
he government.
Medical history teaches that high death rates first reported in outbreaks of
newly recognized infectious agents usually drop as epidemiologists interview
contacts and test for mild infection. Until that is done, death rates
usually are limited to people who get to a hospital, who are often the
sickest and may not receive treatment in time. Even the start of determining
death rates is difficult. As doctors examine patients with respiratory
symptoms, they must overcome practical hurdles like having enough swabs and
other standard equipment to take samples from patients' noses. They must
also know how to obtain the specimens properly.
Few laboratories in developing countries can test for the virus. Also,
sending specimens to laboratories can be nearly impossible because of the
lack of good roads and express mail systems. Specimens must be packed to
stay cold for about 12 hours to preserve any virus [infectivity] present.
But dry ice, widely available in developed countries, is nonexistent in some
affected countries. Dr. Klaus Stohr, the World Health Organization's top
influenza expert, said his team had to fly dry ice from Bangkok to Cambodia
last week to keep specimens cool during shipment to Paris for testing at the
Pasteur Institute. In Southeast Asia, some scientists can test for A(H5N1)
virus only under trying conditions. Dr. Stohr cited one lab where scientists
can work on influenza for only 2 hours a day because they share the space
and equipment with colleagues who study other infectious agents. Under such
circumstances, contamination of tests can be a serious problem.
Japanese experts are re-testing about 100 specimens that a Vietnamese
laboratory reported as negative for A(H5N1). "Of the first 30 so-called
negative, 11 were found positive, suggesting that the Vietnamese laboratory
was missing about 1/3 of cases," Dr. Stohr said. It is not known how many
cases other laboratories are failing to detect. To find out, the W.H.O. is
studying ways to improve the varying skills of the scientists working with
the (H5N1) virus. One possibility is to send specimens with known amounts of
virus to rate laboratory proficiency in detecting the amount, a costly and
demanding exercise. Scarcity of epidemiologists can also delay the medical
detective work to trace how patients became infected and whether they spread
the virus to contacts. In addition, scientists need the viruses isolated
from new bird flu cases to monitor for mutations and genetic changes.
A major change could make useless the current pilot human avian influenza
vaccine that is about to undergo its first tests in people. Although the
latest tests showed no reason to change the vaccine, concern remains because
the W.H.O. has not received any virus isolated in recent weeks, Dr. Stohr
said. The W.H.O. is planning an international meeting in Vietnam this spring
where doctors who have treated one or 2 cases -- too few to report in
medical journals -- can relate their experience. Then other scientists can
learn more about the range of patients' symptoms, the effectiveness of
different treatment regimens and tests of patients' contacts to get a truer
death rate.

[Dr. Altman has restated with commendable clarity concerns that have been
expressed repeatedly about estimates of the extent of exposure of the human
population to avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection in East Asia and the
consequent risk. A circumstance that has not been considered in his article
is an apparent greater vulnerability of the human population in Viet Nam in
comparison with other communities in East Asia. - Mod.CP]
