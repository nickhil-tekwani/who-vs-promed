Garut has 46 bird flu cases
---------------------------
The Garut Health Service has recorded 46 cases of bird flu in Garut
District up to 23 Mar 2009 [presumably since the beginning of the
outbreak in Indonesia in 2005]. The 46 cases included one surviving
bird flu patient, 4 dead bird flu victims, 36 surviving bird flu
suspects and 5 dead bird flu suspects, Dr Hendy Budiman, head of the
Garut health service, said here on Thursday [26 Mar 2009].

The district health authorities even found 2 new bird flu suspect in
Cintanagara village, Cigedug sub district, recently, he said. The 2
bird flu suspects were currently being treated at a local hospital and
their condition was improving, he said. The new patients were a
30-year-old woman and her 35-year-old sister from Tabrik Lebak
Cintamaya kampong [village]. Around 50 chickens died suddenly in the
village of the patients, he said, adding that his office was currently
investigating the sudden death of the chickens.

Meanwhile, a 2-year-old boy died at Arifin Achmad Public Hospital in
Pekanbaru, Riau Islands Province, on Thursday [see: part [2] of Avian
influenza, human (61): Indonesia susp. 20090326.1179]. The child died
after suffering from a respiratory problem and fell unconscious, Dr
Azizman Saad, coordinator of bird flu control at the Arifin Achmad
hospital, said in Pekanbaru on Thursday.

[As of 23 Mar 2009 a total of 4 deceased patients and one survivor
have been diagnosed as positive for avian H5N1 influenza virus. It is
unclear how many of these patients are included in the current WHO
confirmed list of 141 cases and 115 fatalities
(<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2009_03_23a/en/index.html>.
The status of the remaining 5 deceased and 36 suspected cases is
likewise unclear. The current situation appears to be that 2 adult
women who have had contact with diseased fowl are suspected to have
contracted bird flu.
