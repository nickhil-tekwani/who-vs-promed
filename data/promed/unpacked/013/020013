Several people have come down with a so far mysterious disease causing whole-body and deep skin lesions, and other clinical manifestations in Pangasinan, Philippines according to ABS-CBN news. Local health officials describe the manifestations as: "vesicular rashes rising from lower extremities to the head."

The local news story published online on Mon 24 Feb 2014 is entitled "flesh-eating illness in Pangasinan" and covers interviews of individuals affected by this illness, and its clinical manifestations. One of the interviewees explains worm-like organisms surfacing from her skin lesions [submitter: unclear if these were due to fly larvae that had laid eggs and hatched within lesions after lesions were already formed]. The skin lesions appear to spread relatively rapidly, according to other interviewees. Doctors have diagnosed affected patients with several different types of diagnoses (including psoriasis and lupus), but the video indicates that these diagnoses do not fully explain the illness.

Does anyone have information about this illness affecting Pangasinan, Philippines?

There is no truth to rumors that a so-called flesh-eating illness is spreading in Pangasinan as reported in "Bandila" Monday night, 24 Feb 2014, the provincial health officer Dr Anna Marie de Guzman said in an interview with radio dzMM on Tue 25 Feb 2014.

De Guzman said the 2 patients who were earlier reported to be carrying a flesh-eating disease were diagnosed with leprosy and psoriasis. She said the female patient who was diagnosed with leprosy suffered a hypersensitivity drug reaction after taking her medications, causing infections on her skin. The other male patient, meanwhile, is suffering from psoriasis, which causes peeling and reddish-white scales on the skin.

De Guzman assured us that neither of these 2 diseases is contagious.

[It is officially reported that 2 people did not have necrotizing fasciitis (flesh-eating illness) but the initial description seems to imply that there were more than just 2 people. ProMED-mail would like more information should this be the case.
