New potentially more aggressive blight strains increased their
dominance of the potato blight pathogen population during 2007, BPC
[British Potato Council] -funded monitoring has revealed. But with
scientists unsure as to why the incidence of the so-called genotype
13 A2 blight strain has increased so dramatically, growers are being
advised to stick with current best practice approaches to blight
control for the time being.

Speaking at a BPC blight survey seminar, Dr David Cooke of the
Scottish Crop Research Institute [SCRI] said that of 300 total blight
outbreaks sampled by SCRI and the Central Science Laboratory during
2007, 82 percent of the samples were A2 strain only. Two-thirds of
2006 samples were A2. "We've done tests and can confirm that it (A2)
is a slightly more aggressive, fitter genotype under test
conditions," said Dr Cooke.

While the incidence of A2 strains has increased, the incidence of
mixed A1 and A2 outbreaks -- which gives an indicator of the risk of
the 2 types combining to produce oospores -- appears to have remained
constant. This season's sampling revealed no evidence of blight
infections caused by oospores.

Vigilance will be the best way to keep blight in check. Growers
should expect to see high disease pressure early in the season in
2008, he said.

[Potato late blight (PLB) is caused by the fungus _Phytophthora
infestans_, which can also infect other solanaceous crops such as
tomato or eggplant. It is the most devastating disease threatening
potato crops worldwide and can cause 100 percent crop loss. The
fungus affects leaves as well as tubers. It is spread by plant
material (including seed tubers), wind and water, and solanaceous
weeds can serve as pathogen reservoirs. Other fungi and bacteria
often invade blight-infected tubers resulting in total tuber
breakdown. Disease management includes preventative fungicide
treatment of seed tubers and additional fungicide applications to the
crop. Some PLB resistant potato varieties are available.

Worldwide, considerable variation in aggressiveness between different
isolates of _P. infestans_ has been observed. A severe form of PLB
was responsible for the Irish potato famine in the late 1840s. PLB is
considered an increasing problem in many areas because new and even
more virulent strains continue to emerge. Some of these can destroy a
potato plant in a matter of hours and a complete crop within days.

Where both A1 and A2 mating types are present, reproduction occurs
sexually as well as asexually, leading to strains with higher
fungicide resistance and increased yield losses. A1 was the 1st
mating type to spread worldwide; A2 began to spread later and is now
present in northern Europe, northern and Central America, and parts
of Asia. Within each mating type there are a number of genotypes
(strains). In Western Europe, a dramatic increase in the frequency of
the A2 mating type is being recorded recently, with a single lineage
apparently accounting for much of the change in the UK population of
fungal strains.
