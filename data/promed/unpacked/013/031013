Iraq said on Tuesday [28 Feb 2006] it was making checks for 3 suspected
human cases of bird flu in Baghdad and one in the north eastern province of
Dayala. "There are 3 suspected cases in Baghdad and one in the town of
Kefry, in Dayala," said Ibtisam Aziz, head of a Health Ministry task force
charged with monitoring the disease. "All these cases are under observation
now by the Health Ministry."
Previously 2 fatal cases of human bird flu -- a teenage girl and her uncle
in January 2006 -- have been confirmed in the northern province of
Sulaimaniya, close to the border with Turkey.
