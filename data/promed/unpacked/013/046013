[On checking the Scottish daily numbers this is a newly reported case
in Fife, which includes Edinburgh. As this is an urban addiction
problem we might assume that this case is in Edinburgh. There have
been no HPS press releases on these incidents since 22 Feb 2010, and
at the time of posting no press reports in the past 24 hours either. - Mod.MHJ]
