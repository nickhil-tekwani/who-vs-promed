-- 88 per cent -- were not vaccinated against tickborne encephalitis
[virus]. Tickborne encephalitis [TBE] was suspected in 33 persons who were
hospitalized and of these, the diagnosis was confirmed in 14 patients.
The greatest number of people seeking medical aid after tick bites was
registered in the Kabansky district (431 cases), with 113 cases in
Tarbagataysky district and 146 cases in Barguzinsky district. In Ulan-Ude
(the capital of Buryatia), 651 persons have been vaccinated [against TBE
virus].
At the beginning of the [TBE] epidemic season, over 30 000 persons were
vaccinated against tickborne encephalitis [virus], including 15 000
children. Acaricide treatment was carried out in 108 areas, including 58

Since March 2007, 4566 persons, including 1314 children, have suffered from
tick bites in the Arkhangelsk region. The diagnosis of tickborne
encephalitis was made in 63 persons and confirmed in 14 patients. These
data have been provided to the correspondent of an agency in a department
of Epidemiological Supervision of Management of Rospotrebnadzor [Federal
Service for Monitoring Consumer Rights Protection and Human Welfare] in the
Arkhangelsk region. The number of tick bites increased 28.6 per cent in
comparison with the similar period last year [2006].
The greatest number of tick bites has been registered in the Velsky
district (639), followed by Kotlas (454), Koryazhma (353), Kotlas district
(325), Krasnoborsky district (311), Konoshsky district (304), Ustyansky
district (292), Verkhnetoyemsky district (267), Shenkursky district (244),
Hyandomsky district (227), Vinogradovsky (193) districts, Plesetsk (184),
Onega (177), and areas of Kargopolsky district (168).
Basically, [with the warmer weather] inhabitants of southern areas of the
region suffer from tick bites. Lethal outcomes after tick bites in the
region have not been recorded. Victims of tick bites treated in [a timely
fashion] receive [immunoglobulin]. "It is available in enough drugstores of
the city and in the region", reported Rospotrebnadzor. So, 2494 persons
have received immune preventive treatment against tickborne encephalitis
[virus infection], representing 54.6 per cent of the number of the persons
with tick bites who have sought medical aid. Among the adult population,
1337 people have received immune preventive treatment (41.1 per cent of the
number of persons who sought medical aid). Of the children who received
medical aid, 1157 (88.1 per cent) were given immunoglobulin.

The following description of the 2 TBE viruses is reproduced from
ProMED-mail 20050919.2770:
Tickborne encephalitis is caused by 2 closely related flaviviruses. The
eastern subtype of tickborne encephalitis virus (TBE) causes Russian
spring-summer encephalitis and is transmitted by the tick _Ixodes
persulcatus_. The western subtype causes Central European encephalitis and
is transmitted by the tick _Ixodes ricinus_. The eastern subtype occurs
across Russia and northern Asia, whereas the western subtype occurs in foci
from Scandinavia in the north to Greece in the south. The eastern subtype
is associated with more severe disease, and, in some outbreaks, mortality
up to 25 per cent has occurred. The majority of infections are a
consequence of tick bites, but, rarely, infection has occurred by
consumption of infected [unpasteurized] cow or goat milk.
Inactivated vaccines are available for protection against both subtypes. -
