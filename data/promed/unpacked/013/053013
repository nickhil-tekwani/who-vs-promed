Rabbit fever case confirmed on Martha's Vineyard
------------------------------------------------
OAK BLUFFS, MA: Health officials have confirmed the first case of
pneumonic tularemia on Martha's Vineyard since an outbreak that
killed a man and infected 11 others last summer. [A 4-year-old boy was
confirmed as the first case of tularemia there earlier this month, but he
had the ulceroglandular, not the pneumonic form -- see ref. (03) above.

Another person suspected of having pneumonic tularemia, also known
as rabbit fever, has so far tested negative for the disease, but a Martha's
Vineyard Hospital spokeswoman said more blood work needs to be
done to be certain.
The patient diagnosed with pneumonic tularemia is a 72-year-old
chicken farmer, said Bela Matyas, medical director for the
Epidemiology Program at the state Department of Public Health. The
patient undergoing testing is a landscaper in his early 20s; 2 other
patients diagnosed with pneumonia were also treated for tularemia as a
precaution last month. "It makes it clear there is a continuing risk for
certain individuals on the island," said Matyas.
Tularemia is a rare bacterial disease usually contracted [through dog
tick bites or by eating or touching infected rabbits and rodents. The
infection can cause a potentially fatal case of pneumonia like the type
found on the island.
A recent study by the Department of Public Health and the [US
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC found that lawn
mowing and brush cutting could kick up bacteria left over from animal
carcasses or droppings.

[Tularemia is a bacterial septicemia affecting more than 250 species,
including wild and domestic mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, and
humans. The causative bacterium is _Francisella tularensis_ , a
nonsporulating, gram-negative rod antigenically related to _Brucella_
spp.
Among domestic animals, sheep are the primary host, but clinical
infection has been reported in dogs, cats, pigs, and horses; cattle appear
to be resistant. Important wild animal hosts include cottontail and jack
rabbits, beaver, muskrat & meadow voles in North America and other
voles, field mice, and lemmings in Europe and Asia.
The most common source of infection for people and herbivores is the
bite of an infected tick, but persons who dress, prepare, or eat
improperly cooked wild game are also at increased risk. Dogs, cats, and
other carnivores may acquire infection from ingestion of an infected
carcass.
Tularemia is a classic zoonosis capable of being transmitted by aerosol,
direct contact, ingestion or via arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized
organisms can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with or
ingestion of infected carcasses of wild animals can produce the
ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal, or typhoidal form.
The incubation period is 1-10 days in most species. The disease is
characterized by sudden onset of high fever, lethargy, anorexia,
stiffness, reduced mobility, or other signs associated with septicemic
disease.
Tularemia must be differentiated from other septicemic diseases,
especially plague or acute pneumonia. Pneumonic tularemia may be
transmissible between people, but the disease is treatable with
antibiotics. Persistent treatment is necessary, as many organisms are
intracellular. Vaccines are available for people at high risk of infection.
Recovery confers long-lasting immunity. - Mod.TG
