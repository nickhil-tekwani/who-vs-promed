A 7 year old girl from Maia, northern Portugal, has died days after falling ill due to a food-related Escherichia coli infection. Her death was initially linked to her pet hamster [but] authorities have since confirmed the illness is infectious. The young schoolgirl is believed to have caught the dangerous bacterium from something she ate, which caused vomiting and diarrhea and subsequent kidney failure.

The girl, a pupil at the Gandra School Group in Maia, suffered from vomiting and diarrhea for a few days before being urgently rushed to the Sao Joao Hospital in Porto after her kidneys started to fail. She died last [Mon 20 Nov 2017], due to kidney failure, 2 days after being admitted to the unit.

Worried parents at the school were quick to seek reassurances from the local education board, the council and health authorities with regards to their own children's health and safety, along with answers as to whether the illness could be contagious, given that the young girl had fraternized with colleagues. According to reports, at least one other child at the school has shown the same symptoms.

Manuel Ferreira, head of the local school board, confirmed "the disease is transmissible" and informed what preventative procedures should be adopted. The local health board also said an investigation has been launched into the epidemiology, which is caught through "contaminated food or water" as well as being passed on from person to person via the fecal-oral route. Commenting on the hamster link to newspaper Correio da Manha, the head of Portugal's Veterinary Association said that while there are records of such cases, "they are very rare."

[Although not specifically stated, it is most likely that foodborne _E. coli_ infections in children leading to acute kidney failure and death are due to enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_.

Zoonoses from hamsters are uncommon. The commonest is a viral meningitis due to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, an arena iris that is found in rodents around the world. - Mod.LL
