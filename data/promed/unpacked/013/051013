[Since 28 Dec 2006, 7 FMD outbreaks have been identified and reported in
Israel. Three of them -- Netua, Mevo Hama and Beit Hashita -- have already
been published by the OIE. The other 4 have been recorded during the
weekend and not yet published by the OIE; the data are derived from a
circular, sent today (29 Jan 2007) by Israel's CVO to veterinarians, the
industry and other relevant Israeli institutions.
It seems that the 7 outbreaks, thus far recorded, belong to 2 distinct
cycles, in north and northeastern Israel.
The northern cycle involved 2 locations, Netua and Fasuta, adjacent to the
Lebanese border (See square 2 in the interactive map at
<http://www.eyeonisrael.com/Israel-touring-map.html>).
The northeastern cycle, about 100 km south-east to the 1st one, has been
reported from bovines in 5 locations, closer to the Jordanian (and Syrian)
frontiers: Mevo-Hama and Kanaf on the Golan heights (click square 3 of the
said map) and Neve Ur, Moledet and Beit Hashita in the Jordan and Eastern
Yezreel valleys (square 5). In all cases, beef cattle (probably
unvaccinated or vaccinated only once) has been affected. More data,
including the age of the affected animals, might be found in the follow-up
notifications to the OIE.
A rather similar situation, of 2 cycles -- on the Lebanese and Jordanian
frontiers -- was observed in Israel in 1994; for background see text and
map 4 in the section "epidemiology" of the review "Foot and Mouth Disease:
The Israeli Approach", available at the
web-site <http://www.israel-embassy.org.uk/agriculture/>.
It will be interesting to note if, likewise to 1994, during the current
outbreak the 2 FMDV-O cycles will be found to have different genetic profiles.
Lebanon is (unofficially) known to import live cattle from numerous,
diverse sources; the sequencing results of the northern isolates, and their
relationship to other strains, are anticipated with interest.
Likewise, information on the FMD situation in Syria will help. - Mod.AS]
