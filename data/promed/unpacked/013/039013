Typhoid Mary of HIV admits to trying to infect thousands of partners
--------------------------------------------------------------------
An HIV [human immunodeficiency virus] positive man in Michigan turned
himself in to authorities last week [week of 26 Dec 2011] and
confessed to sleeping with 3000 men and women and, according to police
reports, "intentionally attempt[ing] to spread the disease to kill
people."

As it stands the 51-year-old man has only been arraigned on 2 counts
of penetrating a partner who did not know he was positive. One female
victim, who met the subject on Yahoo! Personals, told MSNBC he was a
"sociopath" and a predator. "He hits drifters. He hits people who are
young. He hits young women, and from what I understand, he hits men,
too," she added.

It's unclear whether the subject's lawyers will attempt an insanity
defense. Sexual penetration with HIV is considered a felony in
Michigan but the subject had recently been remanded to a mental
hospital after several suicide attempts. (Files from the hospital
indicate he is "sexually aroused by causing pain to females.")

Attorney Richard Zambon told the network that he plans on "exploring
all options" in his client's defense. "I am concerned about his mental
health." We can only hope that he is delusional and has inflated the
number of his conquests.

On another note, clearly this man needs to be removed from society --
but are "HIV-positive penetration" laws the greater danger?

[Typhoid Mary is an inappropriate heading for this news report. Unlike
the subject of the news report above, Typhoid Mary was unaware of her
typhoid fever carrier status. Typhoid Mary (Mary Mallon (1869-1938)
was a healthy carrier of the disease who infected a number of people
-- at least 3 of whom died -- in New York City. Once identified as the
source of these outbreaks she eventually became demonised in the eyes
of the public. Her nickname remains an all-purpose pejorative term for
individuals -- real or imagined -- who willfully spread disease.
Unlike the HIV-infected person in Michigan, Mary Mallon was unaware of
her carrier status and had no malicious intent.

Mary Mallon worked as a household cook and left a trail of illness
wherever she was employed. After being first identified as a carrier
in 1907, she was quarantined to the Riverside Hospital on New York's
North Brother Island. She was released 3 years later on condition that
she never worked as a cook again. Mary reneged on this deal and was
found working under a different name in the kitchens of a New York
hospital. Following a typhoid outbreak at this hospital she was exiled
again to the island permanently, where she died of pneumonia at the
age of 69, in 1938. (see
