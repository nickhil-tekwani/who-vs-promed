The last official WHO H5N1 Update for Egypt [Thu 31 Mar 2015] listed 125 cases and 33 deaths (see ProMED-mail Avian influenza, human (93): WHO update H5N1 and H7N9, China H7N9 20150416.3301012), but since then, an update from the FAO (on 8 Apr 2015) added 7 further cases.

Today, the FAO [Food and Agricultural Organization] has listed 6 more human cases on their RSS [Really Simple Syndication] feed [Location, Date illness observed -- dates from FluTrackers Egypt -- 2015 WHO/MoH/Provincial Health Depts H5N1 Confirmed Case List https://flutrackers.com/forum/forum/china-h7n9-outbreak-tracking/143874-flutrackers-2013-15-human-case-list-of-provincial-ministry-of-health-government-confirmed-influenza-a-h7n9-cases-with-links)].

1. Confirmed Influenza - Avian in Behera, for human, [30 Mar 2015]
2. Confirmed Influenza - Avian in Behera, for human, [6 Apr 2015]
3. Confirmed Influenza - Avian in Behera, for human, [2 Apr 2015]
4. Confirmed Influenza - Avian in Damietta, for human, [4 Apr 2015]
5. Confirmed Influenza - Avian in Qena, for human, [29 Mar 2015]
6. Confirmed Influenza - Avian in Kafr El-Shikh, for human, [1 Apr 2015]

Based on the information currently available, FluTrackers conservatively shows 143 cases in Egypt since 1 Jan 2015, 3 times more than Egypt has ever previously reported and more than double the number that any country has ever reported in a single year.

The recent slowdown in case reports -- if indeed, that is the case -- would not be totally unexpected, as avian flu transmission tends to decline as the weather warms. But the caveat here is that out of these last 6 cases, 2 were observed in late March 2015, and the newest was observed on 6 Apr 2015.

Although we've not seen any evidence of increased or efficient human-to-human transmission of the H5N1 virus in Egypt, it is worrisome that this outbreak has now gone on for 5 full months, and nearly 180 people have been infected.

To put that into some kind of perspective, Egypt, with a population 1/16th that of China, has racked up nearly as many H5N1 human cases over the past 6 months (180) as has China with H7N9 (200).

[H5N1 in Egypt is now in its 5th month and remains a serious concern to public health. The high number of human cases observed this year (2015) in Egypt correlates with the reports of an increased number of outbreaks and detections of influenza A(H5N1) viruses in poultry in Egypt compared with previous months and compared with the month of April in previous years. See ProMED-mail post Avian influenza, human (93): WHO update H5N1 and H7N9, China H7N9 20150416.3301012 for the WHO update report (as of 31 Mar 2015) for further discussion.
