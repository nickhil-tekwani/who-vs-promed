On 30 Jun 2022, a bat provisionally determined as Brandt's bat (_Myotis brandtii_) was diagnosed as rabies positive in FAT and confirmed by real-time RT-PCR as EBLV-2 at the Swiss Rabies Center. RT-PCR for partial sequencing of the N portion of the genome is underway. This bat, which was found sick with advanced central nervous symptoms and transferred to a bat care station, died overnight.

This is the 1st reoccurrence of bat rabies diagnosis in Switzerland since 2017. So far, only 4 bats, 3 of the species _Myotis daubentoni_ (EBLV-2) and an _Eptesicus serotinus_ (EBLV-1), were found positive in the frame of passive surveillance in 1992, 1993, 2002 (_M. daubentoni_) and 2017 (_E. serotinus_), respectively. Although bat rabies is very rare in Switzerland, this case reaffirms the public recommendation to handle bats with utmost caution, if any.

Infections by European bat lyssavirus type 2 (EBLV-2) have been previously reported in northern Europe, not only in bats but also in humans. EBLV-1 appears to be more prevalent, accounting for the vast majority of all EBLV-infected bats. Most reports of EBLV-2 correspond to Daubenton's bats (_Myotis daubentonii_), suggesting that this bat species is the reservoir of this lyssavirus strain, although this report corresponds to another species of the _Myotis_ genus. - Mod.PMB
