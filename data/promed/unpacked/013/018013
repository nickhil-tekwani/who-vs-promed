The state [of Missouri] continues to investigate the cause of an outbreak of illness last week during a conference at a Jefferson City hotel as the number of confirmed cases continues to climb.

The Missouri Coroners' and Medical Examiners' Association on Fri 15 Mar 2013, reported that 40 to 50 of its members became ill during a 3-day conference at the Truman Hotel and Convention Center, said Roger Mauzy Sr, former president of the group. Mauzy said yesterday [16 Mar 2013] he learned of more illnesses, but he said he could not confirm a total number.

The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services and Cole County Health Department are investigating the cause of the illnesses. People attending the conference began complaining of a dry throat, and several developed a high fever.

"We are advising anyone who is ill to see their primary care physician," said Gene Terlizzi, state health department communications director.

The state's health department could not confirm the number of illnesses yesterday [16 Mar 2013] or the cause. Samples collected at the hotel are being tested by disease and environmental specialists at a health department laboratory. More information might be available tomorrow, Terlizzi said.

Attendees who have fallen ill also are being asked to fill out a survey. As of Fri 15 Mar 2013, the state health department knew of only one hospitalization. Mauzy said he knew of at least 5 members who were treated at hospitals -- either in Jefferson City or when they returned to their home cities Thu 14 Mar 2013.

Approximately 100 members of the association attended the conference. Mauzy said he does not blame the hotel, which the conference has built a good relationship with over many years. "They have worked well with us," he said. "They are friends of ours."

[The etiology of a cluster of illness at a conference manifesting as a dry throat, sometimes with fever, is not clear and may not be infectious in origin. With an attack rate of 40-50 percent, it may well be possible to assess by questionnaire what risk factors are relevant. ProMED-mail awaits for more information about this illness. - Mod.LL
