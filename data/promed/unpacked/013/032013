The World Health Organization will hold an emergency meeting Thursday [19 May 2016] on the yellow fever outbreak that has hit hardest in Angola but risks spreading further if vaccinations are not ramped up.

Such meetings from the U.N. agency are often held before the declaration of an international health emergency, as happened amid the Ebola outbreak in West Africa and the current surge in neurological disorders linked to the spread of Zika virus in the Americas.

WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told AFP [Agence France Presse] the meeting had been called to underscore the severity of the yellow fever outbreak and to re-emphasise the need for mass vaccination against the viral disease.

As of 12 May [2016], Angola had reported 2267 suspected yellow fever cases and 293 deaths in an outbreak that began in December [2015] and is most heavily concentrated in the capital Luanda.

The Democratic Republic of Congo has registered 44 suspected cases, both from a local outbreak and from patients who carried the virus from neighbouring Angola.

WHO has said: "11 people have tested positive for yellow fever in China after returning from Angola, highlighting "the risk of international spread through non-immunized travellers."

Several cases have also been reported in Uganda [although not related to the Angola outbreak - Mod.TY].

The percentage of people immunized against yellow fever remains low in many parts of Africa, even though the vaccine is nearly 100 percent effective and relatively cheap.

WHO has sent 11.7 million doses to Angola, and there are plans to vaccinate 2.2 million people in DR Congo.

WHO has pledged to beef up its emergency response systems after widespread criticism following the Ebola outbreak, with many experts saying it took the U.N. body far too long to sound a global alarm.

[Because of concern that the number of vaccine doses needed may exceed the supply, one hopes that this meeting will indicate the number of yellow fever (YF) vaccine doses that are available currently. If the number of individuals who need the vaccine in the 3 affected countries (Angola, the DR Congo and Uganda) to achieve 80 percent coverage in areas of transmission is more than the available doses, some prioritization will be needed, and reduction of the dose to 1/5th the volume normally used will need to be considered.

The Ministry of Health has finalised arrangements to offer free vaccination to residents in Masaka sub-region as the area grapples with a yellow fever outbreak.

According to Dr Stuart Musisi, the Masaka District health officer, the district received instructions from the ministry to educate the public to embrace the 4-day exercise, which kicks off this Thursday [19 May 2016].

He explains that the ministry, with the support of the World Health Organization (WHO) and partners, received the vaccines valued at Shs 2.1b [USD 626 325], which they are going to administer to all people aged 6 months and above throughout the district.

"We have our batch, and we are set to start the vaccination exercise, and our target is to immunise at least 300 000 people," Dr Musisi said during an interview at the weekend.

Ever since the outbreak was confirmed early last month [April 2016], dozens of suspected cases of yellow fever have been reported, and 13 deaths have been registered.

Dr Musisi said they have since continued to receive more probable cases, the majority of which are concentrated in the forested sub-counties of Buwunga, Bukakata and Mukungwe.

"Our teams have been attending all suspected cases from the established special treatment centre at Masaka hospital. But now that we have finally got the vaccines, we are yet to completely contain the situation by providing the most appropriate preventive approach against the fever," he added. He, however, encouraged residents to uphold other preventive measures, such as sleeping under mosquito nets and clearing bushes around homes.

According to a statement issued by Dr Jane Ruth Acheng, the Director General of Health Services, the vaccination exercise will as well be extended to the districts of Kalangala and Rukungiri, where other confirmed cases were reported.

Last week, the Ministry of Health issued a statement confirming a similar outbreak in Kalangala after one death had been reported.

The whole exercise targets 643 765 people from the 3 affected districts. and the ministry encourages the public to embrace these free services.

According to WHO, a single dose of yellow fever vaccine is sufficient to provide sustained immunity and life-long protection against the hemorrhagic fever, and a booster dose of yellow fever vaccine is not needed. The vaccine provides effective immunity within 30 days for 99 per cent of persons vaccinated [the vaccine is protective 10 or more days after administration. - Mod.TY].

[The numbers of people needing the vaccine and the number of vaccine doses available is confusing. The target is to immunize 300 000 people, but the whole exercise is reported to target 643 765 people from the 3 affected districts [the population at risk?]. Perhaps a 2nd round of vaccination is planned, but there are no statements to that effect. Previous reports indicated that the cases early in the outbreak were spill-over from the sylvan (forest) transmission involving mosquitoes and non-human primates. The most effective way, by far, of stopping the outbreak from spreading is vaccination of 80 percent of the population at risk. It is not clear whether there is enough vaccine available to do that currently. Apparently, the vaccine will be provided free of charge to vaccinees. An earlier report indicated that there would be a charge.
