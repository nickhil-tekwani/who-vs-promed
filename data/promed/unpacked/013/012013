Endemic Lassa fever in Sierra Leone
--------------------------------------
Dr. Aldis in the last posting from Sierra Leone described a case of Lassa
fever in the UN peacekeeping force in Sierra Leone. The soldier had been
stationed in Daru and later sent to Freetown for treatment. The following
comments are comments from Dr Susan Fisher-Hoch in response to some
specific requests for information from Dr. Aldis. [Posted with permission.
"Daru is right in the center of the endemic area and cases should be
expected. Mild and asymptomatic infections are quite common. In a
prospective study published by my husband, Joe McCormick, seroconversion in
a prospective study in villages in that area showed that between 5 and 14%
of all febrile illnesses among villagers are Lassa fever, and the illness
to infection ratio is between 9 and 50%. So at least half will be
asymptomatic. Overall mortality untreated is 2-4%, this rises to 16% in
hospitalized patients.
"Oral ribavirin is only recommended for post exposure prophylaxis, and only
if IV [intravenous is absolutely unavailable. Efficacy of oral ribavirin
for Lassa fever is only fair, but IV as long as it is started with 7 days
of onset of fever reduces mortality dramatically even in high risk patients
(high viremia and high liver enzymes). All this is and much more is
published data in major journals, so you should have already had easy
access to it. Lassa fever is the best studied of all the hemorrhagic
fevers, and most of the data are published.
"Lassa fever should be as high on your differential diagnosis list as
malaria in the circumstances of the UN troops around Daru and other eastern
regions. There should be no hesitation in starting ribavirin the moment the
diagnosis is suspected, because toxicity is very low, and the risk of
losing the patient if you delay is very high indeed. Again, all this is
published data in primary form in major journals and reviewed multiple
times in book chapters and elsewhere".
