*** Cases for which insufficient clinical information was provided.
**** Total number of human cases of WNV illness reported to ArboNET by
state and local health departments.
Neuroinvasive Disease refers to severe disease cases, particularly West
Nile meningitis and West Nile encephalitis.
West Nile fever refers to typically less severe cases that show no evidence
of neuroinvasion.
West Nile fever is not currently on the list of nationally notifiable
diseases, and therefore, it is optional whether or not state health
departments report these cases to CDC. Click the above CDC site [URL above]
for further explanations of neuroinvasive West Nile virus disease and West
Nile fever.
Other Clinical includes persons with clinical manifestations other than WN
fever, WN encephalitis or WN meningitis, such as acute flaccid
paralysis. Unspecified cases are those for which sufficient clinical
information was not provided.
Total Human Cases Reported to CDC: These numbers reflect both mild and
severe human disease cases occurring since 1 Jan 2006 reported to ArboNet
by state and local health departments.
ArboNet is the national, electronic surveillance system established by CDC
to assist states in tracking West Nile virus and other mosquito-borne
viruses. Information regarding 2006 virus/disease activity is posted when
such cases are reported to CDC.

weekly basis and are reported to the CDC ArboNET for the following 5
categories: wild birds, sentinel chicken flocks, human cases, veterinary
cases, and mosquito surveillance. Maps detailing county-level wild birds,
sentinel chicken flocks, human cases, veterinary cases, and mosquito
surveillance data are published each week on the collaborative USGS/CDC
West Nile virus website.

found in Arizona, Arkansas, California, Florida, Iowa, Montana, Nevada,
North Carolina, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Utah and Virginia. [Not every
state has a sentinel program. - Mod.JW]
WN equine infections have been reported from Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas,
California, Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska,

[The numbers of West Nile virus infections in humans, wild birds,
mosquitoes sentinel animals, and horses is declining sharply, no doubt to
the onset of cold weather with a reduction in vector
mosquitoes. ProMED-mail readers should note the change in URL for the
USGS/CDC weekly maps. Maps for other arthropod-borne viruses in the USA are
covered at this site also, including St. Louis encephalitis, eastern equine
encephalitis, western equine encephalitis, La Crosse encephalitis, and
Powassan. The URL for all of these maps is <http://diseasemaps.usgs.gov/>.

[5] Mexico - suspected, RFI
Date: 11 Nov 2006
From: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>
Source: Diario de Yucatan, Mexico 11 Nov 2006 [translated by Mod.TY; edited]
<http://www.yucatan.com.mx/noticia.asp?cx=11$1000000000$3419577&f=20061111>

The Yucatan [state] Secretary of Health awaits the results from the
National Institute of Epidemiology Reference [laboratory] to confirm or
rule out the 1st West Nile [WN] virus case in Yucatan. A 20-year-old woman
died with meningoencephalitis similar to that caused by WN virus.
The Animal Health laboratories have detected [WN virus antibodies] in
confined farm birds (roosters, hens and turkeys), but without disease
[When? This year? - Mod.TY].
According to Julian Garcia Rejon, medical entomologist in the arbovirology
laboratory of Hideyo Noguchi, migratory birds from the north overwinter in
Yucatan; humans and animals are infected from the bite of the vector
mosquito _Culex pipiens_, which are abundant in Yucatan.
In an interview, Dr. Jimenez Rios said that it is necessary to await the
laboratory results, because from 2003 to date there have been 22 [WN virus]
suspected cases in the state [Yucatan]. In 2003 there were 6 suspected
cases, in 2004 2, in 2005 3, and this year [2006] 11.

[ProMED awaits the results of the laboratory case with interest, as well as
any other information about WN virus cases throughout Mexico this year. A
