A patient hospitalized in Berlin in September 2020 has been confirmed to have been infected with West Nile virus (WNV).

Initial diagnosis was based on a positive WNV IgM/IgG antibody test. However, tests of stored samples (taken between [1 Aug and 20 Sep 2020] showed seroconversion over the course of the disease.

Additionally, blood samples taken at the beginning of September 2020 were retrospectively tested by RT-PCR and were positive for West Nile virus RNA. The infection was likely acquired locally, as no travel activity was reported.

In light of the increase of human West Nile virus cases in Europe, including outbreaks in birds in Berlin (see ProMED archive no. 20200908.7758101) and the lack of available virus sequences, we want to share the partial WNV genome sequence data (1966 bp) obtained from the blood sample of this case.

The virus genome fragments are highly similar to that of strains (Genbank Acc. No. MH924836, MN794939, and others), obtained from birds in Eastern Germany in 2018 and 2019.

We have submitted the partial genome sequences to NCBI GenBank for immediate release (Acc. No. MW072297).

[ProMED thanks Victor Corman and colleagues for this report on a human case of West Nile virus infection and the genomic data links for the circulating avian and human WNV sequences.

West Nile virus (WNV) is a flavivirus that is maintained in an enzootic cycle between ornithophilic mosquitoes, mainly of the _Culex_ genus, and certain wild bird species. Bird species such as ravens, jays, and raptors are highly susceptible to the infection and may develop deadly encephalitis, while other species are only going through subclinical infection. Infections in horses and humans are rare accidental spill-over events, through the bite of a bridging species of mosquito, such as _Culex modestus_ and _Cx pipiens molestus_ or very rarely through surgical interventions such as blood transfusion, organ transplant, or injection of blood products.

In Germany, it is believed that WNV was most likely introduced in a single introduction event from the Czech Republic during mid-2016 to north-east Germany where autochthonous transmission has since occurred (Ziegler et al. 2019; https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/4/448).

This resulted in equine as well as human cases in 2019, and increasing numbers of human cases are being reported this year as evident from the 2 ECDC reports below.

It is recommended that intensive surveillance of mosquitoes, birds, horses, and humans should remain a public health priority to monitor the occurrence and subsequent spread of WNV or to develop targeted control mechanisms. - Mod.UBA]

Situation update
----------------
Between [2 and 8 Oct 2020], EU Member States reported 28 human cases of WNV infection: Italy (11), Germany (7), Greece (5), Spain (3), and Romania (2). 2 regions in Germany (Meissen and Halle (Saale)) reported locally-acquired human cases of WNV infection for the first time through TESSy. All other cases were reported from areas that have been affected during previous transmission seasons. This week, one death was reported by Romania. No human cases of WNV infection or deaths were reported from EU neighbouring countries.

Since the start of the 2020 transmission season and as of 8 Oct 2020, EU Member States have reported 285 human cases of WNV infection and 31 deaths through TESSy [The European Surveillance System]: Greece (135, including 20 deaths), Spain (75, including 7 deaths), Italy (54, including 3 deaths), Germany (12), Romania (6, including 1 death), and Hungary (3). The province of Badajoz, Spain, and 5 regions in Germany reported locally-acquired human cases of WNV infection for the 1st time (regions of Barnim, Ostprignitz-Ruppin, Saalekreis, Halle (Saale), and Meissen). All other cases were reported from areas that have been affected during previous transmission seasons. No cases have been reported from EU neighbouring countries.

Since the beginning of the 2020 transmission season, 162 outbreaks among equids have been reported. These outbreaks have been reported by Spain (126), Germany (18), Italy (12), France (3), Hungary (1), Portugal (1), and Austria (1) through ADNS [Animal Disease Notification System]. No outbreaks among birds have been reported through ADNS.

Situation update
----------------
Between [25 Sep and 1 Oct 2020], EU Member States reported 14 human cases of WNV infection: Greece (7), Spain (5), and Italy (2). The province of Badajoz, Spain, reported locally-acquired human cases of WNV infection for the 1st time through TESSy. All other cases were reported from areas that have been affected during previous transmission seasons. This week, 2 deaths were reported, by Greece (1) and Spain (1). No human cases of WNV infection or deaths were reported from EU neighbouring countries.

Since the start of the 2020 transmission season and as of 1 Oct 2020, EU Member States have reported 257 human cases of WNV infection and 30 deaths through TESSy: Greece (130, including 20 deaths), Spain (72, including 7 deaths), Italy (43, including 3 deaths), Germany (5), Romania (4), and Hungary (3). The province of Badajoz, Spain, and 3 regions in Germany reported locally-acquired human cases of WNV infection for the 1st time (regions of Barnim, Ostprignitz-Ruppin, and Saalekreis). All other cases were reported from areas that have been affected during previous transmission seasons. No cases have been reported from EU-neighbouring countries.

Since the beginning of the 2020 transmission season, 134 outbreaks among equids have been reported. These outbreaks have been reported by Spain (102), Germany (16), Italy (11), France (3), Hungary (1), and Portugal (1) through ADNS. No outbreaks among birds have been reported through ADNS.

["In Europe, WNV is reported to have emerged in Romania in 1996 with 393 WNND (West Nile neurologic disease) cases and this was followed by another major outbreak in southern Russia in 1999. Since 1999, there has been WNV activity (that is, reports of the virus being detected in either mosquitoes, birds, or mammals, including humans) recorded in Europe most years and every year since 2010 with the European West Nile season normally running from June to November. Figure 1 (https://academic.oup.com/jtm/article/25/1/tay096/5116057) shows an overview of the number of cases by year and number of European countries reporting cases."

"WNV appears to be expanding its geographical range in Europe and in the rest of the world, causing increasing numbers of outbreaks associated with human morbidity and mortality. Multiple de novo introduction of unrelated WNV strains has been demonstrated in Europe, raising concerns about the potential emergence of strains with increased virulence, and the limitations of current diagnostic tests in identifying novel and unexpected WNVs. Given this continuing unpredictability and the rapid development of epidemics, timely surveillance for WNV infection is needed on an EU-wide scale. This includes veterinary and entomological surveillance, as well as molecular surveillance of emerging strains." (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X14614154).
