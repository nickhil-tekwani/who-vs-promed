[Since the start of the rabies continuing event in Greece, on 15 Oct 2012, 44 "outbreaks" (in practice, cases) of rabies in animals have been reported to the OIE. A summary, including an interactive map showing all cases found in domestic and wild animals, is available at http://tinyurl.com/nnmfqon.

The current case, in a domestic dog, has been preceded by 3 previous cases in the province Thessalia (Thessaly), of which 2 were in foxes. Thessalia is the most southern province in Greece affected so far (see in the above interactive map; zoom in).

Greece was rabies free for 25 years (since 1987). When the old zoonosis was reintroduced (2012), The current rabies cycle appears to be sylvatic, foxes being the reservoir. Until 1987, dogs were the main reservoir of rabies in Greece.

To try to control rabies in Greece, coordination with its rabies-endemic neighbours on the north (Albania, former-Yugoslavian Macedonia) and east (Turkey) is essential.
