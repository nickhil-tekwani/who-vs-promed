Reports reaching Citi News indicate the cholera situation in the Western Region is fast deteriorating as over 120 cases have been recorded within a period of 2 weeks. According to the Western Regional Director of the Ghana Health Service (GHS), Dr. Emmanuel Tengkorang, the situation in the region may worsen if the outbreak in Accra is not contained.

"2 weeks ago, it was 89, and now we are at 120, and we have found out that the situation in Accra is affecting us because a lot of people commute from Accra to Takoradi, and they most of the time come with this condition," he said. Dr. Tenkorang further explained that the commuters, after contracting the disease in Accra, "introduce the infection into the communities."

Citi News' Western Regional correspondent, Obrempong Yaw Ampofo, reported that 7 out of the 22 districts in the region have reported an outbreak of the disease. Out of the 7, the 2 main urban districts, Sekondi-Takoradi Metro Assembly and the Tarkwa Nsuayem Municipal Assembly, have recorded the highest cases so far. The remaining districts are Shama with 10 recorded cases, Wassa East with 8 cases, and Jomoro with 12 cases. Obrempong also reported that 31 new reported cases have been recorded within a period of 2 weeks.

Meanwhile, the Greater Accra Regional Health Directorate has announced that the number of cholera cases being reported daily has significantly reduced. Over 10 000 Ghanaians have been affected by the cholera outbreak, killing more than 80 in 7 regions across the country.

[6] Cholera - India (Assam State)
Date: Tue 16 Sep 2014

Cholera claimed 5 lives, and 100 patients are undergoing treatment, following the outbreak of cholera and diarrhoea at 2 tea gardens in Lakhimpur district [Assam state]. Since August 2014, reports of the spread of cholera and diarrhea have been coming in from the Koilamari Tea Estate and its division at Zoihing. This has been attributed to the lack of sanitation facilities and pure and safe drinking water for workers.

The Koilamari Tea Estate and its division allegedly lack basic amenities like toilets and safe drinking water facilities. The workers of these 2 tea estates reportedly use toilets built during the British era, and most of them are also forced to go for open defecation. This area located along the Assam-Arunachal Pradesh border is also prone to vector-borne diseases like malaria and is affected by depredations [incidents of wild elephants straying into human habitats and destroying crops] during winter.

This time the misery of the workers of the 2 tea estates has intensified with the outbreak of cholera and diarrhea. According to the Lakhimpur District Health Department, 3 persons have died of cholera in the area so far, and many ill persons have been admitted to the North Lakhimpur Civil Hospital for treatment. The Health Department has dispatched a team of health workers, headed by Senior Health Officer (Epidemic) Dr JN Das, to provide medical service in the affected areas.

Meanwhile, the management of these 2 tea estates has been accused of neglecting the health concern of the workers. The Welfare Officer of the tea estate, however, claimed that sanitary toilets are available for workers.

[7] Cholera - Iraq (Kurdistan)

The Kurdistan Region's Ministry of Health has assured that there has been no cholera outbreak in any refugee camp in Kurdistan. However, there has been a warning about its outbreak outside the camps. Recently there were rumors circulated regarding a supposed cholera outbreak in the Domiz refugee camp in Duhok, which left people concerned.

Kurdistan's Ministry of Health spokesperson Khalis Qadr told BasNews that the rumors are not true and the likelihood of a cholera outbreak is not in the camps; rather, it is outside the camps. "We will continue to monitor the situation and we will try to prevent any threats of spreading the disease," said Qadr.

"The threat of cholera's outbreak is outside the refugee camps. This is due to sheltering refugees in inappropriate places like living in incomplete buildings without having access to basic needs like clean water which could lead to the spread of the bacterium."

Khalis Qadr stated that cholera usually spreads in September; otherwise, the threat of the spread of the disease will disappear.

Cholera outbreaks happen during the changing of the seasons, and there were reports of Cholera threat last year [2013] in Kurdistan which caused numerous people to die from the disease.

Cholera spreads due to the lack of access to clean water, especially in public places.
