[Ref: N Boughalleb-M'Hamdi et al (2020): First report of citrus black spot disease caused by _Phyllosticta citricarpa_ on _Citrus limon_ and _C. sinensis_ in Tunisia. New Disease Reports 41, 8; DOI: 10.5197/j.2044-0588.2020.041.008]
---------------------------------------------
In March and April 2019, symptoms resembling citrus black spot were observed on citrus fruit (_Citrus limon_ and _C. sinensis_) in Nabeul Gouvernorat. A survey was undertaken in 339 orchards in this region. Symptoms were observed in 69 orchards. Diseased fruits had freckle spots or hard spots bearing pycnidia, whereas no symptom was observed on leaves.

Pathogen isolates were identified tentatively [by morphology] as _Phyllosticta_ spp. The species was confirmed from 2 cultures, one each from lesions on fruits of _C. limon_ and _C. sinensis_, by sequencing two genes (tef1 and LSU). BLAST analysis showed 100% identity with _P. citricarpa_ for both isolates. To verify the pathogenicity of 21 isolates, a bioassay was conducted on detached lemon fruits. The fungus could be isolated again from the lesions, thus fulfilling Koch's postulate.

To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of _Phyllosticta citricarpa_ causing citrus black spot on citrus in Tunisia. The disease may have a severe impact on citrus production in Tunisia by reducing yield and affecting the quality of _C. limon_ and _C. sinensis_. Surveys are ongoing and management strategies have been developed to control and limit the spread of the disease.

[Citrus black spot (CBS) caused by the fungus _Phyllosticta citricarpa_ (previously _Guignardia citricarpa_) is one of the most serious diseases of the crops in Asia and regions of the southern hemisphere. Symptoms can occur on leaves but are most severe on fruit. They include sunken lesions of varying size, shape and colour, depending on stage of fruit or leaf development. The disease may also lead to post-harvest losses since fruit may not show visible symptoms while on the tree. However, characteristic lesions may develop in storage under suitable conditions. Fungal strains which do not cause symptoms also exist. CBS causes significant losses due to premature fruit and leaf drop, as well as disfiguration of fruit for fresh markets.

Spores are produced under fallen leaves and sometimes on fruit. Spread occurs by air currents, on contaminated plant material (including nursery plants or scions with latent infections) and by mechanical means. The disease is particularly virulent late in the season and losses tend to be most severe in late maturing varieties. All commercial citrus cultivars are susceptible to varying extents, except for sour orange (_Citrus aurantium_). Disease management includes fungicides, phytosanitation and pathogen exclusion.

CBS was been introduced into the USA by unknown means (2010; ProMED-mail post 20100412.1183), illustrating the risk to northern hemisphere citrus industries. Once established in a region, eradication of a sporulating fungus such as _P. citricarpa_ is considered impossible. Due to the threat of CBS introduction, the disease has been included in the A1 quarantine list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO).

In the EU, a large number of quarantine detections, including on imports from Tunisia (ProMED-mail posts 20190520.6477094, 20131204.2090761) implied that certification of disease freedom at point of origin was not working effectively and stricter regulations were introduced (see ProMED-mail post 20150714.3509850). A study published in 2017 suggesting that the fungus is already present in Europe was considered unconvincing by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), but monitoring is still ongoing (for more information see links below). CBS incursions in citrus producing areas of southern Europe remain a threat to the region.
