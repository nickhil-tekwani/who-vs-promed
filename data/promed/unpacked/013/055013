[There is a graph of the cumulative number of monkeypox cases as of 1 Jul 2022 (https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/monkeypox?yScale=log&facet=none&Metric=Confirmed+cases&Frequency=Cumulative&Shown+by=Date+of+report&count).

Communication and community involvement will be key to bringing transmission to a halt. The ECDC and WHO have issued a joint bulletin addressing approaches that can be used to reach the most affected cohort (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/ECDC-WHO-Risk-communication-community-engagement-monkeypox-outbreak-Europe.pdf). - Mod.TY]

The Brazilian Ministry of Health reported this Sunday [3 Jul 2022] that the country now has 76 confirmed cases of monkeypox, although it clarified that none of them are serious and that all patients are under strict medical surveillance.

The ministry also indicated that there are at least 6 other people who are suspected of having contracted the disease and guaranteed that the situation is constantly under control by that office and the health secretariats of the 27 states of the country.

This Sunday [3 Jul 2022] the 1st case was confirmed in the Federal District of Brasilia, bringing the number of fully verified cases to 76 in the country.

According to the Ministry of Health, the state of Sao Paulo, the most populous, already has 52 confirmed cases, while there are another 16 in Rio de Janeiro, 2 in Minas Gerais, 2 in Cear√°, 2 in Rio Grande do Sul, and one registered in Rio Grande do Norte and another in the Federal District.

The 1st case of monkeypox was recorded in Brazil on [8 Jun 2022], and the 1st 15 patients were found to have previously traveled to other countries, especially Europe, where it is presumed that they contracted the disease.

However, the 1st autochthonous cases were detected on [23 Jun 2022] in Sao Paulo.

Current situation
------------------
Canada
The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is working with provincial and territorial public health partners to investigate cases of monkeypox in Canada. As the investigation evolves, it is anticipated that additional cases will be reported in Canada. Provinces and territories have publicly reported 300 cases of monkeypox as of 4 Jul 2022 at 1:00 pm EDT.

Jurisdictions in Canada with confirmed cases
Province / No. Confirmed cases
------------------------------
British Columbia / 4
Alberta / 8
Ontario / 77
Quebec / 211
Total / 300

PHAC is continuing to collect and analyze epidemiological information reported by the provinces and territories to help define the national scope of the investigation and to determine if there are any increased health risks to people in Canada. Going forward, case numbers may change as provinces and territories continue to receive confirmatory testing results from PHAC's National Microbiology Laboratory. On an ongoing basis, provinces and territories are reviewing case data in their jurisdictions and those that meet the case definition will be reported to PHAC to be included in the national investigation.

How Canada is monitoring monkeypox
----------------------------------
The Public Health Agency of Canada is working with provinces, territories and international partners, including the World Health Organization, to actively monitor the situation. Global efforts are focused on containment of the outbreak and the prevention of further spread.

Canada's Chief Public Health Officer of Canada is in close contact with provincial and territorial Chief Medical Officers of Health to ensure that any cases of monkeypox occurring in Canada continue to be rapidly identified and managed in order to protect the health of Canadians.

Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory is performing diagnostic testing for the virus that causes monkeypox. In addition, the laboratory is also conducting whole genome sequencing, an enhanced fingerprint analysis, on Canadian samples of monkeypox. This sequencing will help our experts understand the chains of transmission occurring in Canada. The laboratory is working in close collaboration with provincial and territorial public health laboratories to provide testing guidance and to increase testing capacity for monkeypox.
