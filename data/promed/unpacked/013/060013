Malformed Proteins Found in Sheep Muscle
----------------------------------------
Prions, the misfolded proteins that are widely believed to cause
brain-wasting diseases, have been found in sheep muscle, scientists
announced yesterday -- the 1st time they have been discovered in animal
flesh that many humans normally eat.
But the scientists emphasized that the finding did not mean that lamb or
mutton posed a danger to humans.
"The risk of transmission from sheep to humans is very, very low," said
Olivier Andreoletti, a prion specialist at the National Veterinary School
in Toulouse, France, and lead author of the study, which was published
yesterday in Nature Medicine.
The prions were found at 1/5000 the concentrations that are found in sheep
brains, and therefore likely to be much less infectious.
Also, the animals were infected with scrapie, a prion disease that is not
the same as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease. Although
the symptoms of scrapie have been described in sheep for centuries, and
scientists believe that mutated scrapie prions may have caused the British
epidemic of mad cow disease of the 1980's, no case of scrapie transmitted
to humans has ever been found.
Moreover, according to Dr. Paul Brown, a prion expert at the National
Institutes of Health, in nearly 40 years of trying, no researcher has
ever infected a healthy animal with a prion disease by injecting it with
liquefied muscle from a sick one -- not even when the injection was
directly into the brain.
It is even less likely that a human could be infected by lamb or mutton
that has passed through the acidic process of digestion, scientists said.
The study team, based at 3 French research institutes, found prions in the
leg muscles of sheep that were naturally infected with scrapie and in sheep
deliberately infected with it. In one naturally infected sheep, they found
scrapie 8 months before the animal showed any signs of the disease, which
include itching that makes animals scrape themselves against trees and
fences (hence the name), tremors, stumbling gait, and eventually, lethargy
and death.
Although he agreed that prion levels in the meat were low, Dr. Giuseppe
Legname, a prion expert at the University of California at San Francisco,
called the finding "a warning."
2 years ago, in collaboration with Dr. Stanley Prusiner, who won a 1997
Nobel Prize in Medicine for his work in the field, Dr. Legname found prions
in the muscles of mice and showed that they could replicate there. Since
then, Swiss researchers have found prions in the muscles of humans with
sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a degenerative brain disease that is
thought to arise spontaneously in one in a million humans.
That prions exist in the edible parts of livestock, Dr. Legname said,
suggests that the United States should screen livestock to minimize the
chances that Americans will be exposed to infected animals. The United
States Department of Agriculture, which tested about 20 000 cattle a year
for mad cow disease before finding one positive for it in December 2003,
has announced it will test more than 200 000 animals starting in the summer
of 2004, but that is still only a small fraction of the number of animals
that Europe tests.
Dr. Brown, who spent decades on prion research, said he was not surprised
that they had been found in sheep muscle. "In the last few years, the
sensitivity of immunoblot tests has been ramped up so much that people
are beginning to find the protein all over the place," he said.
He ventured a prediction: "Within the next year, somebody will make a big
splash by finding it in the muscles of cattle," he said, "and the beef
industry will go crazy."
Nonetheless, he said it was still his instinct that beefsteak had not been
the culprit in transmitting mad cow disease from cattle to humans in Europe.
"Mechanically recovered" meat, which is squeezed off chopped-up bones under
pressure, a process that in many cases mixes in spinal cord and nerve
tissue, was a "much better vehicle," he said. Late in 2003, spinal cord and
nerve tissue from cows over 30 months old was banned from human food.

Infectious Agent Found in Leg Muscles of Sheep, but researchers confident
that lamb eaters face no significant danger
---------------------------------------------------
Evidence of rogue proteins associated with brain-wasting diseases has been
found in the leg muscles of sheep, the first such finding in animals that
enter the human food chain.
Scientists said the discovery involving the sheep disease scrapie
nevertheless does not seem to pose a significant threat to people.
The proteins, called prions, have been found in the muscles of infected
humans and rodents but not previously in the muscle tissues of animals
whose meat is commonly eaten by people. Also linked to prions are mad cow
disease and chronic wasting disease in deer and elk.
A researcher who studied the scrapie-infected sheep said the possibility
that the prions would infect people appears very unlikely because extremely
small amounts of the proteins have been measured in the muscle.
Jacques Grassi of the Pharmacology and Immunology Service of the Department
of Medical Research, CEA-Saclay, France, said the finding suggests that a
more complete examination of muscles is needed from sheep or goats infected
with scrapie strains and whose muscle meat could enter the human food chain.
Grassi, co-author of a paper to appear Sunday in the online edition of the
journal Nature Medicine, cautioned against extending results of the
research to mad cow disease.
That disease, formally known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, also is
caused by prions but has a much lower rate of infection for tissues beyond
the brain and spinal cord than does scrapie.
Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease is the human form of mad cow disease
associated with eating beef from infected cattle. It has been blamed for
143 deaths in Britain and 10 elsewhere [Including 2 countries with endemic
human cases; 6 in France, 1 in Italy. - Mod.AS]. No Americans are known to
have contracted the disease in this country, although one case of the
disease has been reported in a cow.
Robert Petersen, a neurological specialist at Case Western Reserve
University in Cleveland, said scrapie has existed for 300 years and does
not seem to pose a significant threat to human health.
"However, the endemic occurrence of scrapie creates the potential for
transmission to other animals that may be a threat to human health," said
Petersen, who was not part of the research team. Like any infectious agent,
he said, the scrapie prion could possibly mutate.
William Hueston of the University of Minnesota said that although the
report is the 1st to show prions in muscle tissue of an animal in the human
food chain, it is not a major cause for alarm.
Scrapie tends to infect more tissues in an animal than mad cow disease
does, he said. Although this suggests the prion that causes illness in
cattle eventually might be found in muscle tissue, it probably would be in
very small amounts.
The research was supported by the French ministry of research, the European
Union and the French region of Midi-Pyrenees.

[Current data from experimental oral challenge of cattle indicate that the
pathogenesis of BSE in this species appears to have a much more restricted
tissue dissemination and reduced involvement of the lymphoreticular system
in comparison to scrapie in sheep. The prominent organs found with
infectivity in cattle were the brain, spinal cord, dorsal root ganglia,
trigeminal ganglia, distal ileum, and bone marrow. Until recently, it was
generally agreed (see ref) that the highest levels of infectivity in sheep
were recorded in brain and spinal cord; moderate levels -- in various lymph
nodes, spleen, tonsil, ileum, proximal colon, and peripheral nerves; low
levels were recorded in cerebral spinal fluid, nasal mucosa, adrenal
glands, sciatic nerve, distal colon, pancreas, liver, bone marrow, thymus,
and supramammary lymph node. No detectable infectivity was reported in
blood clot, mandibular and parotid salivary glands, thyroid, heart, lung,
kidney, skeletal muscle, mammary gland, and testis. The latter findings
will have to undergo reassessment.

Rev.sci.tech.Off.int. Epiz, 22 (1), 121 - 143. - Mod.AS]
[Since scrapie is a TSE, does this indicate the possibility of prions from
BSE-infected cattle into muscle tissue? If so, then how many prions does it
take to be infective to humans? Is it a cumulative dose, or is there a
threshold at which the human body becomes susceptible to the disease? How
much of a role does genetics play? Although this is intriguing research, it
may create more questions than it answers. - Mod.TG]
