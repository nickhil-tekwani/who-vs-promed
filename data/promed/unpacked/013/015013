A sixth case of meningococcal disease has been reported in a first year
student at the University of Southampton. All six cases are first year
students, and they all became ill during October. Three have died. The
PHLS Meningococcal Reference Unit at Manchester Public Health Laboratory
has confirmed five cases as Neisseria meningitidis group C (three by
culture, two by the polymerase chain reaction). One suspected case has not
yet been confirmed by the laboratory. The first five cases lived in the
same accommodation complex, but they were in different faculties. The
1,200 first year students who live in the same accommodation complex were
offered ciprofloxacin prophylaxis and vaccine. The sixth case lived in a
different accommodation complex from the other five cases. Following the
sixth case, all other first year students, all other students who live in
halls of residence (regardless of year), all staff who work in the halls of
residence, and everyone who stayed for three nights or longer in any of the
halls of residence since 20 October 1997 were offered ciprofloxacin
chemoprophylaxis and vaccine. There appears to be no overlap between the
close contact groups of the six cases. The University of Southampton has
decided to offer vaccine to any other students and staff who wish to be
vaccinated. Consultants in communicable disease control and
microbiologists who know of cases of meningococcal infection that may be
related to the University of Southampton are requested to contact Dr. Mike
Barker (tel 01703 725507).
