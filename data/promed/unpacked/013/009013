I don't believe the relationship of EBV with malaria is incidental, rather
it's likely to be indirect, and there may be other factors besides malaria
that can cause the same effect. The unique feature of EBV in this region is
the early age of infection. Most children are infected by age 5. In most of
the West, the typical age is closer to 10.
The scenario for EBV promoting BL is as follows: EBV infection
expands the B cell pool by inducing antigen independent replication. In
very young children, this B cell pool is enriched for B cells prior to
heavy chain Ig [immunoglobulin] rearrangement.
Thus, the population of B cells rearranging
their DNA is greater. This increases the likelihood of an aberrant
rearrangement (which is the hallmark of Burkitt's lymphoma). But this
aberrancy probably occurs in all of us to some extent (although perhaps
more frequently in these kids because their B cell pool is larger to start
with). This itself is not enough to cause the cancer.
This is because an intact immune system would remove abberantly rearranged
B cells, which with the Burkitt's DNA rearrangement can grow autonomously.
With malaria, there will be some degree of immunosuppression which retards
the ability to eliminate the B cells.
In American type BL (also known as sporadic), the aberrant DNA
rearrangement is not with primary heavy chain rearrangement, but with heavy
chain class switching. This will occur much less frequently, and because
there is less chance for immunosuppression, the rate of sporadic BL
is much lower compared to African type BL (also called endemic). The
population most at risk for this in the USA is the HIV positive population.
Here we have an immunocompromised population, but with some degree of B
cell stimulation. Only about 20% of HIV Burkitt's lymphomas are EBV
positive, suggesting that the role of EBV is only to expand the pool of
potential aberrant rearrangement, rather than contributing a specific
oncogene.
Extremely sensitive PCR analyses have demonstrated that aberrant DNA
rearrangements do occur in lymphocytes of normal people, probably as a
result of occassional mistakes, but our immune system likely can handle
the low frequency [&] prevent leukemias from emerging.

The list of EBV associated tumors is gradually growing, Hodgkin's disease
being the most prominent in recent years. Parotid gland carcinomas have
been reported in Eskimos and small cell gastric carcinomas in Japan are
others. In these cases, the EBV genome has been found expressing genes in
the tumor cell itself.

[We thank Michael for the additional information, & for giving me the chance
to correct my previous comment. What I investigated 40 years ago with
Julian de Zulueta was the apparent suppression of the o´nyong-nyong fever
virus (yes, there IS such a virus -- check the ProMED-mail archives for
1997) in a hyper-endemic malarial area of Uganda, hypothetically in the
vector mosquito, & not an enhancing effect of malaria on EBV in the human to
produce BL. (I claim that so far I only have Heimer´s -- not full-blown
Alzheimer´s). - Mod.JW]
