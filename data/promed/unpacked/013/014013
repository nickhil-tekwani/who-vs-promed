Johannesburg (Business Day, March 29, 1999) - An outbreak of African
horsesickness (AHS) in the Western Cape is threatening South Africa's (SA)
horse-breeding industry.
The African Horsesickness outbreak occurred in Jonkershoek valley near
Stellenbosch, and has been traced to two carriage horses brought into the
area from Frankfurt, Free State, on March 3. Horses brought into the
Western Cape are required to be certified as free of AHS. Those regulations
were not followed.
Ten riding horses which contracted the disease, spread by midges, have died.
If the outbreak in the Cape is confirmed as serious, SA could be banned from
exporting horses for two years.
SA's horse-breeding industry has flourished since the EU agreed to the
quarantine procedure. Prof Alan Guthrie, director of theOnderstepoort Equine
Research Center said a vaccination program had been started by the Western
Cape Veterinary Services.
However, horses already in quarantine would be allowed to leave the country.
The Western Cape is usually free of AHS, and after negotiations, the
European Union (EU) agreed more than two years ago to a quarantine procedure
for the export of SA horses.
Horses in the region are not usually vaccinated against AHS since the region
has long been free of the disease. None of the horses that died had been
vaccinated.
Guthrie said the EU was informed of the outbreak on Friday.

Cape Town (Cape Argus, March 29, 1999) - The thoroughbred horse racing
industry is shocked about the implications of a confirmed African Horse
Sickness (AHS) death in Stellenbosch last week. The export of racehorses has
been stopped with immediate effect.
Considerable money has recently been pumped into the horse-breeding industry
since the lifting of the export ban related to the risk of the disease. The
protocol had involved many years of negotiation with the European Union.
With export now impossible for at least two years, the implications for the
horseracing community are bleak.
All horses based in the Wellington, Paarl, Franschhoek, Stellenbosch,
Somerset West and Strand areas were placed under compulsory quarantine last
weekend. Veterinary Service director Rudolf Visser said this morning that
his department did not have the personnel to monitor movement of horses and
relied largely on the horse-owning community.
"We have only had one officially confirmed African Horse Sickness death, in
the Stellenbosch area," said Mr. Visser. "From the symptoms, we are
satisfied in our own minds that another five died of the disease, but until
we get the results of the tests from Onderstepoort, this cannot be
officially confirmed."

[It is important to know if it is one horse or six. If someone with
knowledge would let us know, we would appreciate it.
African Horsesickness (AHS) is a highly fatal insect-borne viral disease of
horses and mules and a subclinical diease in other _Equidae_. The clinical
signs and lesions result from selective increased vacular permeability and
characterized by an impairment of the respiratory and circulatory systems.
There are four clinical forms of AHS: the peracute or pulmonary form, the
subacute edematous or cardiac form, the acute or mixed form and the
horsesickness fever form. AHS is an orbivirus that is present in the blood
and organs, such as spleen, lung and lymph nodes, in high concentrations.
AHS is a non-contagious disease and the virus is transmitted by biting
midges (_Culicoides_ spp.). In susceptible horse populations the fatalities
range between 70-95 percent and the prognosis is extremely poor. In mules
the mortality rate is about 50 percent and in the European and Asian donkeys
about 5-10 percent. No mortality is observed among African donkeys and
zebra. These may be subclincial carriers.
In enzootic regions, the mortality rate is modified in proportion to the
immunity acquired by the equine population as a result of the previous
vaccination or exposure to natural infection. Animals that recover from the
disease develop a life-long immunity against the virus.
There is no evidence that man can become infected with field strains of AHS
virus, either through infected animals or from working in laboratories.
However, it has been shown that certain neurotropic vaccine strains may
cause encephalitis and retinitis in humans following transnasal infection.
