A total of 4 villagers from Mwanyisa Village near Checheche Growth Point in Chipinge South [Manicaland Province, Zimbabwe] were recently admitted in hospital after consuming meat infected with anthrax. The outbreak was confirmed on [3 Jan 2014] after villagers visited St Peter's Mission Hospital for treatment. The villagers had all the symptoms of an anthrax attack, prompting health authorities at the hospital to contact the Veterinary Services Department.

Chipinge district administrator Mr Edgars Seenza confirmed the outbreak and said personnel from the Veterinary Services Department rushed to Mwanyisa Village where they confirmed the outbreak of anthrax. A total of 15 cattle and 3 goats had succumbed to the disease.

The Veterinary Services Department alerted other arms of the Government and the Civil Protection Unit taskforce visited homesteads in Mwanyisa Village on an awareness campaign.

However, at one of the homesteads in Mwanyisa they found the people consuming meat of the dead animals. Others had sold the remaining portions to their neighbours. The team urged the villagers to stop eating the meat and burn or bury the livestock.

"In mitigation against the spread of the disease, the Veterinary Services Department managed to vaccinate all animals in the anthrax prone area. The health department is educating the community about the anthrax outbreak and the Zimbabwe Republic Police has temporarily banned livestock movement in the area in order to stop the spread of the disease to other areas," said Mr Seenza. He said the situation was now under control.

[To control anthrax cost-effectively, one has to be proactive, ahead of the curve, and to have vaccinated the livestock in the high-risk areas before outbreaks occur. Reactive vaccination may appear impressive, but it eats up money inefficiently. Depending on human cases to locate outbreaks is inefficient because not all livestock anthrax cases result in human cases. To prevent human cases, all at-risk herds and flocks need to be vaccinated before the start of the "anthrax season". And because livestock cases are under-reported, the control areas should extend out a minimum of 5 km [about 3 miles] from any known outbreaks.
