In April (2016) a TB-positive animal from Indiana was found by FSIS [USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service] officials at a Pennsylvania [PA] processing plant. Indeed, the trace began in PA but this was after the discovery by FSIS inspectors at the packing plant. There are no TB positive herds or animals with a PA origin. I would like to clarify that the initial herd from April 2016 and the current 2nd herd in Franklin County are both located in the state of Indiana.

From the moderator's comments: [The animal found in Franklin County, Indiana in late April 2016 was "a trace-out from a herd in Pennsylvania." Indiana has been following up on this particular case by placing a 10-mile [16 km] quarantine circle and tracing all animals into (trace-ins) and out of (trace-outs) the Indiana index herd.]

Regarding the [moderator comments] section reproduced above I would like to point out that the trace originated in Pennsylvania from a slaughter plant and the positive cattle did not spend any time on a Pennsylvania farm.

[The original ProMED-mail post on this issue is: Bovine tuberculosis - USA (02): (IN, PA) 20160502.4197585. It stated: "Staff of the Indiana State Board of Animal Health (BOAH) is investigating a case of bovine tuberculosis (commonly called "TB," or more formally known as _Mycobacterium bovis_) in a beef cattle herd in Southeastern Indiana. The TB-positive cattle were identified through routine inspection at a meat processing facility in Pennsylvania." This seemed to make it plain the animal was identified on routine slaughter testing in a Pennsylvania facility.

The 2nd posting on this situation (Bovine tuberculosis - USA (08) (IN) 20161228.4729068) states that the herd was in Pennsylvania and not an animal at a slaughter facility. This moderator apologizes for the incorrect statement, which should have said "at a Pennsylvania slaughter facility", not a herd in Pennsylvania.

We appreciate the communications from David Wolfgang and David Zellner pointing our incorrect statement and providing us with an opportunity to correct it. - Mod.TG
