Up to 2550 pigs and bulls in Vietnam's central highlands Lam Dong
province have been infected with foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] in
recent days, local newspaper Pioneer reported Tuesday [18 Apr 2006].
The disease has hit the pigs and bulls in 7 out of 12 districts and
towns in the province. Most of the infected animals are in Duc Trong
district. By Monday, 2250 animals in the district contracted the
disease, more than 800 of them died.
Lam Dong may have to announce an outbreak of FMD in its territory in
the coming days, said Pham Van An, director of the provincial
Agriculture and Rural Development Department.
The province currently has 669 poultry- and cattle-trading centers,
nearly 500 of them operate without licenses, the newspaper said.

[In yesterday's newswire, morbidity and mortality rates addressed
pigs only, mentioning 1000 cases in pigs, of which 400 died. Today's
article refers to the total number of affected and dead animals of
both species. The unusual high mortality rate, if accurate, may
indicate that the disease affected primarily young stock.
Confirmation, full epidemiological and demographic data per species,
and serotyping/genotyping if positive, are expected. - Mod.AS]
