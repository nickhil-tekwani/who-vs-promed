Cholera spreads to Vilankulo
----------------------------
The health authorities in Vilankulo district, in the southern
Mozambican province of Inhambane, have confirmed at least 22 cases of
cholera during the past week [late Mar, early Apr 2004], reports the Wed 7
Apr 2004 issue of the Maputo daily "Noticias".
During the last few days [early Apr 2004], patients complaining of diarrhea
and vomiting, the main symptoms of cholera, have sought medical care in
Vilankulo, but only after laboratory analysis by the Inhambane provincial
hospital was the diagnosis confirmed. This contrasts with the situation in
the rest of the province, particularly in the cities of Inhambane and
Maxixe, where the health authorities say the situation is under control.
In the central province of Sofala, the epidemic has claimed 1 more life in
Gorongosa district, thus bringing to 25 the total figure of deaths by
cholera in that province since the outbreak of the disease there in January
2004.
The most affected districts in Sofala -- besides Beira, the provincial
capital, which accounts for by far the largest number of reported cases
-- are Dondo and Nhamatanda. The Beira Cholera Treatment Center (CTC)
reported 29 new cases on Tue 6 Apr 2004 alone, bringing the total number of
patients admitted for cholera treatment to 3717. By 6 Apr 2004, the local
CTC had 97 patients still under medical care.
As for Maputo [capital of the country], where there was once a peak of 350
patients each day seeking help, at the CTC in Mavalane General Hospital, the
number of new cases is down to 70 per day, which the health authorities
describe as a positive development.
"We have been recording relatively small numbers of patients at the wards,
and that puts us more at ease, although it also means that more work should
be done to bring these figures even lower", said Maputo city health
director, Olivia Ferreira. She attributed this improvement to the health
authorities' efforts in education campaigns, and the people's understanding
of and adherence to them.
In other provinces, namely Gaza, in the south, and Zambezia in the central
region, the situation is also reported to be under control. Zambezia
reported 8 new cases on Tue 6 Apr 2004, 3 of them in Quelimane, the
provincial capital, 2 in Namacurra district, and the remainder in
Nicoadala. In Gaza, 7 new cases were diagnosed in the last day, 4 in the
district of Chibuto, 2 in Chokwe, and 1 in Xai-Xai, the provincial capital.

8 new cholera cases in North West
---------------------------------
8 new cases of cholera have been reported during the last 24 hours in the
Kanana township near Klerksdorp, the North West health department said on
Wed 7 Apr 2004.
Baba Gaoganediwe, the departmental spokesperson, said in a statement that
58 people were still being treated in hospital for cholera. Since the
outbreak of the disease last week, 78 cases had been reported. 2 people
have died of the disease.
Gaoganediwe says that, due to a collective effort by the provincial and
national health departments, the department of water affairs and forestry,
the Klerksdorp municipality, the water board, and local doctors, the
outbreak has been brought under control.
The source of the disease remained a mystery, especially after water
samples tested negative for cholera.
Gaoganediwe says investigations into the source of the disease are
continuing. "The focus of the department and of our outbreak response team
is on management of patients, health promotion, public awareness, attention
to sanitation and surveillance," he said. "We remain confident that through
our hard work and attention to every lead, the source of this outbreak will
be found."

Dysentery claims 5 lives in Gorakhpur
-------------------------------------
At least 5 children have died in the last 2 days [5-6 Apr 2004] in
Gorakhpur as hospitals reported an alarming rise in the number of dysentery
cases. Dozens more are seriously ill, and hospitals are overflowing with
more and more children being brought in everyday.
A common ailment, the disease has taken on serious proportions due to a
severe heat wave which has led to a water shortage that has forced villagers
to draw water from untreated sources like rivulets. Worried parents have
traveled hundreds of kilometers to Gorakhpur to get their children treated.
"The epidemic started 3 or 4 days back, and we expect more patients. If
primary aid is given to them, then they can be saved. 5 children have died.
Each day, 10-15 children are being admitted to the OPD [Out-Patient
Department]," R.K Gupta, junior doctor at the city's main medical college,
said. State authorities say all efforts are being taken to prevent the
epidemic from spreading.
