Abnormal increase in measles
----------------------------
Measles has seen an "abnormal increase" in Burkina Faso in the past 3
months, after a steady 5-year decline in the incidence of the
disease, the health ministry reported on Mon 15 Feb 2009. "An
abnormal increase in the number of measles cases has been registered
from November [2008] to February [2009], above all in children under
5, contrasting with the decline in cases of the disease these past 5
years," Dr. Ousmane Badolo told Agence France-Press (AFP).

Badolo, who heads the epidemic disease surveillance unit, said the
situation was unusual and had led so far to 9 deaths out of 1 795
known cases in the landlocked sub-Saharan country, one of the poorest
in the world. Doctors have been sent out across Burkina Faso to study
the profile of the outbreak and oversee care and preventive measures,
the senior health official said.

"Adults have also been affected, but the most numerous cases have
been in children under 5," Badolo said. He could not at this stage
give a reason for the outbreak in a nation where "measles cases have
dropped... because of the efficiency of our vaccination campaigns."

Measles is a highly infectious disease easily treated in developed
nations but dangerous and sometimes fatal in poor countries. It
induces a high fever, runny noses, coughing, skin irritation with red
patches, and infected people are very sensitive to light.
