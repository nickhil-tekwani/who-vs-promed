[1] Stripe rust, wheat - USA (Montana): 1st report

A disease that can reduce crop yield has been confirmed on some of
the hard white winter wheat at a Montana State University farm west
of here, an MSU scientist says. The report of stripe rust on some
varieties of hard white winter wheat is believed to be the 1st report
in Montana, said Carol Flaherty of the MSU News Service.
"Conditions have been extremely favorable for stripe rust
development, and if it remains cool and wet, we may see this disease
blow up very quickly," said Mary Burrows, a plant pathologist for the
MSU Extension Service. The spores germinate best when the temperature
is 41-59 F [5-15 C]. "If we get the cool, wet weather predicted,
growers should expect to apply a fungicide to susceptible varieties
at the 1st signs of infection," Burrows said. Infected varieties at
the MSU farm are Nuwest and Big Sky.
Yellow pustules that occur in stripes are a symptom of stripe rust.
The disease can also affect spring wheat.

[2] Stripe rust, wheat - Australia (northern New South Wales and
Queensland): new pathotype alert

The discovery of a new pathotype of wheat stripe rust in southern New
South Wales (NSW) and Victorian wheat last year [2006] has prompted a
reminder for farmers to be on the alert for the disease in the coming
season.
Queensland Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries (DPI&F)
plant pathologist Peter Wilkinson of the Leslie Research Centre said
the new pathotype has increased virulence against the wheat stripe
rust resistance gene Yr17. Mr Wilkinson said several wheat varieties
drew their stripe rust resistance from the Yr17 gene and these
varieties would be carefully monitored in southeastern Australia in
the coming season. The new pathotype was discovered at low levels by
the Australian Cereal Rust Control Program (ACRCP) based at Cobbitty,
near Sydney.
Mr Wilkinson said there was no sign of the new pathogen in Queensland
and northern NSW wheat last year [2006]. "We placed stripe rust
probes at 18 sites throughout the area last season. The probes
included varieties which could be expected to be more susceptible to
the new stripe rust strain," he said. "Results from the testing of
samples sent to the ACRP showed none of these stripe rust isolates to
be of the new pathotype." Mr Wilkinson said it was possible the rust
pathotype could establish in the region in the coming season and
urged growers to be on the lookout for stripe rust symptoms. "The
risk will be greater if we have higher rainfall than usual," he said.
Grains Research and Development Corporation (GRDC)-supported research
will monitor the impact and spread of the new rust as part of the
ACRCP. The DPI&F is now placing probes for the disease throughout the
wheat growing regions of northern NSW and Queensland for the 2007
season. If any of these probes show the new pathotype, growers will
be alerted immediately.
Mr Wilkinson said continuing to use resistant varieties was the best
and most economical defense against stripe rust. "If stripe rust is
detected, an early spray of a registered foliar fungicide provides
good protection. Seed dressings can be effective if there is an early
stripe rust epidemic. They can reduce seedlings' coleoptile lengths,
which can cause a problem when using deep sowing."

[Wheat stripe rust, also called yellow rust, is caused by the fungus
_Puccinia striiformis_ var. _striiformis_ and occurs worldwide,
mostly in cooler climates. It causes yellow leaf stripes, stunting of
plants and reduced grain number and size on developing heads. Yield
losses may vary from 40 up to 100 percent. It affects wheat, some
barley varieties, triticale and a number of grass species. Spores are
wind dispersed in several cycles during the cropping season.
The fungus needs living plants to survive between seasons, it cannot
survive on seed, stubble or in soil. Volunteer plants generate a
"green bridge" providing the main source of rust inoculum to infect
new crops. Only one infected leaf per 30 ha of re-growth is needed to
produce severe epidemics. The susceptibility of available volunteer
wheat cultivars influences the quantity of inoculum generated. Use of
resistant varieties, control of volunteer plants and fungicide
applications are part of disease management.
Pathogens can mutate spontaneously and randomly, and mutants are
referred to as pathotypes, races or strains. In plants, they may
differ in their ability to infect host cultivars, depending on what
resistance gene or genes are present in the host. If a new strain has
developed the ability to overcome a particular resistance gene, the
resistance in the respective host cultivars is said to have "broken
down." However, it is the pathogen that has changed, not the
resistance gene in the host cultivar.
Stripe rust was introduced to eastern Australia in 1979, most likely
from Europe. A number of strains with increased virulence on more
wheat varieties developed over time. These strains did not spread to
Western Australia. The pathogen was then introduced again to Western
Australia in 2002, probably from the USA. The WA strain had spread to
eastern Australia by 2003, where it is now dominant. The ACRCP
monitors the occurrence of cereal rust pathotypes throughout
Australia each year. The pathotypes are identified by glasshouse
tests on seedlings of known susceptible and resistant cultivars,
which can also be used as field probes. Surveys of rust pathotypes in
2003, for example, identified 6 pathotypes of stripe rust, 9
pathotypes of wheat stem rust ( _P. graminis_), and 6 pathotypes of
wheat leaf rust (_P. triticina_).
