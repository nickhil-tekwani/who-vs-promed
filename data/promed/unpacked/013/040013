The last outbreak of Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis [in Mexico was in
Chahuites, Oaxaca in June, 1996, and of Eastern Equine Encephalitis in
Aldama, Tamaulipas in September, 1996.
The purpose of this post is to clear up the animal health status of Mexico
in regards to the previous messages about equine encephalitis (EE), that
were posted in March 3 and March 10,1999. This was due to a
misinterpretation of the Mexican official reports by INPAZ-PANAFTOSA, which
informed about the occurrences of several outbreaks of this disease in our
country.
The surveillance for EE is permanent in the country, neurological cases in
horses are mandatorily reported, and samples are collected and sent to the
Exotic Animal Disease High Security Laboratory. Therefore the
misinterpretation has to do with the *suspect* samples that are continually
sent for surveillance purposes.
Somebody at INPAZ-PANAFTOSA considered as positive some of the negative
cases reported at the end of 1998 and in 1999. During 1997-99, ALL the
investigations of suspected cases of EE had yielded negative results at
100%.
We have already complained with the PAHO representative in Mexico about this
misleading information. We give them a weekly report of EE zoosanitary
status and they in turn give this information to INPAZ-PANAFTOSA.
I hope that this will clarify the matter and ask you to make it public as
well.
Please contact me in case you need more information.
