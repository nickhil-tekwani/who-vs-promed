Efforts to contain rice blast disease
-------------------------------------
Agriculture officials have launched a drive to prevent outbreaks of rice blast disease. Since the crop is vulnerable especially in the winter season, farmers should be careful in adopting precautionary measures.

A team inspected the paddy fields at Thoothukudi [Tuticorin] district [Tamil Nadu state], where the outbreak had taken place. If such disease was ignored, grain yield loss would scale up to 80 percent, Joint Director of Agriculture NK Dhakshinamoorthy said. [The] fungus would attack the aerial parts of paddy plants in all stages of growth, he said.

To ward off any such disease outbreaks, the farmers were asked to apply fungicides.

[At a farmers meeting], the president of the Tamil Nadu Horticulture Crop Producers Association said that the disease had caused extensive damage to the crop, particularly at a time when the crop was about to mature.

The farmers brought with them a few bundles of the withered crop and appealed [for] compensation.

When Guru Raj Singh, Joint Director of Agriculture, explained that a sudden change in weather condition caused the disease and the department had recommended measures to tackle it, farmers said that the crop had already withered away fully, particularly in 2 blocks.

[Rice blast is caused by the fungus _Magnaporthe oryzae_ (previously classified as a strain of _M. grisea_, synonym _Pyricularia oryzae_). It is one of the most destructive diseases of rice worldwide with potential yield losses of more than 50 percent. Symptoms include lesions on all parts of the shoot, as well as stem rot and panicle blight. When nodes are infected, all plant parts above the infection die, and yield losses are severe. When infection occurs at the seedling or tillering stages, plants are often completely killed. More than 50 species of grasses and sedges can be affected by related pathogens, but most strains isolated from rice can only infect a limited number of cultivars.

Symptom severity and spread of the blast fungus are influenced by climatic conditions. The disease is also favoured by high nitrogen levels (for example from fertilizers) and high humidity. The fungus is spread by infected plant debris, mechanical means (including insect activity), water and wind. Disease management may include fungicides and cultural practices but relies mainly on resistant varieties. However, the fungus is highly variable, and this favours the emergence of new strains with increased virulence.

In a recent survey amongst a group of about 500 fungal plant pathologists, rice blast was perceived as the fungal disease with the highest potential scientific and/or economic importance (see link below).
