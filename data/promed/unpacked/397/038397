6 people were infected with a bacterium from the Caribbean which has made itself at home in a popular German vacation destination. One of them is now in a coma. The bacterium, _Vibrio vulnificus_, is found in parts of the Baltic Sea and other regions of the world, though most-concentrated in the Gulf of Mexico. It spreads best in brackish waters with temperatures above 20 deg C [68 deg F].

"This could be found anywhere as long as the conditions are right," Dr Heiko Will, the 1st director of State Office of Health and Welfare (LAGuS) of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, told The Local. "It is just as prevalent in Denmark, Poland, and all along the German coast."

The victim had been holidaying on the island of Usedom [Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania] at the end of July 2014, according (LAGuS). He passed away at the beginning of August 2014. Another pensioner has been in a coma for 3 weeks and there is a possibility he will lose a leg. He went swimming near Ahrenshoop [Vorpommern-Ruegen district, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania] with a small open wound on his leg. He went to the hospital after noticing on the drive home that his leg had turned blue. Doctors diagnosed a blood infection caused by _Vibrio vulnificus_.

"My husband would not have been in the Baltic Sea under any circumstances had he known about the danger," his wife told the Ostsee Zeitung. "His serious illness and the havoc the sepsis has brought to him and his family could have been avoided with better information, such as a notice from the resort."

LAGuS told dpa news agency that doctors were told to look out for infections at the beginning of the summer, though no public notice was given. Cooler temperatures have made the already low risk of contracting the bacteria even more nominal.

"The results we have from [Mon 1 Sep 2014] tests showed a stark decrease in the presence of _V. vulnificus_" Dr Will said. "The cooler temperatures have done their job."

The last recorded deaths in Germany from _V. vulnificus_ infection were in 2010, when the bacterium claimed 2 victims.

[Related to the recent heat waves in Europe and the USA, more areas are reporting infections due to pathogenic _Vibrio_ species in usually cooler climates. Germany, Netherlands, Sweden, and Denmark have all reported cases.

_Vibrio vulnificus_, a lactose-fermenting, halophilic, Gram-negative, opportunistic pathogen, is found in estuarine environments and associated with various marine species such as plankton, shellfish (oysters, clams, and crabs), and finfish. Environmental factors responsible for controlling numbers of _V. vulnificus_ in seafood and in the environment include temperature, pH, salinity, and amounts of dissolved organics.

Wound infections result either from contaminating an open wound with sea water harboring the organism, or by lacerating part of the body on coral, fish, etc., followed by contamination with the organism. The ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in gastroenteritis. The "primary septicemia" form of the disease follows consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals with underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease. The organism can also enter through damaged skin. In these individuals, the microorganism enters the blood stream, resulting in septic shock, rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50 percent). Over 70 percent of infected individuals have distinctive bulbous skin lesions (shown at http://safeoysters.org/images/sym_2_photo.jpg).

Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecklenburg-Vorpommern) also known as Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania in English, nicknamed MeckPomm or MV) is a federated state in northern Germany.
