Thousands Of Letters Could Have Trace Amounts Of Anthrax
--------------------------------------------------------
Tens of thousands of letters mailed around the country may have picked up
trace amounts of anthrax in a New Jersey postal facility, but the
government hasn't decided whether to track down that mail, anthrax
investigators said. It has been almost 8 weeks since this mail was possibly
tainted in the anthrax bioterror attack. "With each passing day, the lack
of further cases occurring is grounds to diminish the risk from any one of
these letters," stressed Dr. Jeffrey Koplan, head of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.

Investigators already have tracked 300 letters that passed through the
Trenton, N.J., facility within seconds of anthrax-laden letters mailed to
Democratic Sens. Tom Daschle and Patrick Leahy. Health officials in every
region that received the suspect letters are watching for anthrax symptoms,
but so far no infections have turned up, Koplan said. But the way the mail
was processed suggests far more than 300 letters could have picked up small
amounts of anthrax in that post office, he said.

"There seems to be the potential for not just hundreds and not just
thousands but tens of thousands and maybe more letters to be potentially at
risk for some level of cross-contamination," Koplan said.

The count comes as investigators struggle to unravel the mystery of how
women - one 94-year-old from Oxford, Conn., another, 61-year-old, of New
York - inhaled enough anthrax to kill them. The New York woman died in
October; the Connecticut woman, in November. No traces of the bacteria have
been found in either woman's home, mail or usual locales. Yet suspicion
that cross-contaminated mail might have killed the Connecticut woman grew
Monday because of circumstantial evidence: A trace of anthrax was found at
a Connecticut postal center that processed mail for her hometown, as was a
letter mailed to a nearby home that contained a single anthrax spore.

Linking the New York woman to cross-contaminated mail is even harder. A
letter addressed to a South Bronx business near her home went through the
Trenton postal facility at about the same time as the letters to Daschle
and Leahy, but that letter hasn't been found.

The public shouldn't conclude that this was the way the women were
infected, said Dr. D.A. Henderson, the government's top bioterrorism
adviser. "We have difficulty in accepting that," because past studies have
suggested trace amounts aren't enough to cause the deadly inhaled form of
anthrax. [Bill Patrick tells me that he is equally sceptical. - Mod.MHJ

Meanwhile, investigators hope the Leahy letter will offer important clues
to the source of the anthrax and the perpetrator, because it was discovered
unopened and full of the bacteria. But they haven't yet determined how to
open the letter safely.

All the other known anthrax-attack letters were opened, letting the
bacteria escape, before the investigation even began. In Washington, a
Senate office building contaminated when the Daschle letter was opened 15
Oct 2001 may not reopen until early next year, cleanup workers said Monday.

[I suspect that that senior spokesmen should be under a permanent hyperbole
constraint. With each day the continuing absence of other cases gives one
greater and greater confidence that the risks posed by those letters were
and are minimal. The ability to identify and trace over 300 letters through
the system is very impressive and gives confidence for future
investigations. - Mod.MHJ

Scientists begin to open Leahy anthrax letter
---------------------------------------------
Scientists at Fort Detrick, a germ warfare research lab in Maryland, began
on Wednesday the process of opening an anthrax-contaminated letter
addressed to Sen. Patrick Leahy, according to the FBI. The letter was
discovered and quarantined 16 Nov 2001.

Scientists hope to carefully extract the anthrax from the letter and
preserve much of it to analyze and learn its source. They may open the
letter further another day to actually take the letter out.
