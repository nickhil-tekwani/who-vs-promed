Following the registration of several outbreaks of bluetongue disease in sheep and cattle in the states of Al-Bayd, Saida, Laghouat, and Msila, the [regional veterinary services (RVS)] in Setif have warned livestock breeders of the danger of the disease spreading among their livestock, with the need to take precautions against the outbreak.

According to the sources of Sawt Setif, the RVS stated that bluetongue disease is transmitted from one animal to another by mosquitoes, causing severe health risks and huge economic losses.

They called on farmers to monitor their livestock, including sheep and cows, and to inform the veterinarian in the event of clinical signs such as high temperature, nasal discharge, catarrh, swelling of the nose and tongue, lesions on the hooves and udders. In order to prevent infection, the RVS called to avoid introduction of animals from infested areas, clean and disinfect livestock stables, while tightening periodic monitoring of livestock herds.

[During the current season of transmission, bluetongue clinical signs have been observed in both cattle and sheep. Additional information can be found in ProMED-MENA post 20210810.8585133.

There is variation in susceptibility amongst ruminant species. BTV infection of cattle is usually subclinical, except for infection with serotype BTV-8. Sheep are regarded as more susceptible to BTV with a considerable variation in the susceptibility of sheep breeds.

ProMED would appreciate receiving further information from knowledgeable sources about the serotyping results of the BTV involved in the current event in Algeria, and about the clinical signs observed. - Mod.SF

The alert published by the regional veterinary services of the Wilaya (province) Setif points at bluetongue circulation in the Wilayat (plural of Wilaya) El Bayadh, Saida, Laghouat, and M'sila (table presenting Algeria's 58 Wilayat and a map are available at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria#Administrative_divisions).

Official confirmation or otherwise is anticipated.
