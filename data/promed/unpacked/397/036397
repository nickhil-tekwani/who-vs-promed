Raccoons can have other neurological diseases. I would cross off
toxoplasmosis, antifreeze poisoning, and distemper. I would also go through
the rule out of whether there was a true exposure. As you are aware one can
pet a rabid animal without an exposure. I don't believe there has ever been
an authenticated case of rabies in a human from a racoon.
Before I vaccinated a bunch of kids for rabies I would see what the lab had
to say. You should be able to get a report within 24 to 48 hours. You have
a five day window before you have to start rabies prophylaxsis.
One also has to remember that the vaccine is not innocuous. There have been
many reports of allergic reactions besides the high cost of PEP [post
exposure prophylaxsis given on days 0,3,7,14,21 or 28 for people exposed to
the rabies virus.

I don't mean to diminish the message that wild animals should be avoided,
especially when they act tame. But I also must respond to the comment that
"Any wild raccoon in a public place in daylight is virtually pathognomonic
for a very suspect rabies case". This is the wise default option when a
human exposure has occurred and an animal is not available for testing.
Yet, I've submitted dozens of neurologic raccoons for rabies testing,
without a positive. We certainly have our share of rabid raccoons in
Maryland, but canine distemper (and an ascarid or two) may be the more
common cause of these signs. While a rabies test is pending, it should be
considered a pending test, not a foregone conclusion.

Just to "tie the ribbon" upon the anecdotal potential rabies exposure I
described. [Rabies, raccoons - USA (Connecticut) 981126012544, involving
two young boys who rescued a sick raccoon from other boys pelting it with
stones.
The animal tested negative in the end. Perhaps ?distemper. At any rate, the
case still illustrates the concerns raised by terrestrial rabies. One has
to wonder how many such near misses occur that we never hear about.
Occasionally when I see that odd neurologic presentation of aseptic
meningitis or perhaps even that nondescript viral illness (clinically) I
wonder if that's how incubating rabies presents.
The CDC human rabies case reports always describe the hapless primary care
or emergency physician who saw the patient in the early stages of the
disease and diagnosed some bland illness only to be horrified later ...
If for no other reason than to stimulate discussion the case was
interesting.
I'm curious as to the 1991 date given for the Northeast corner of the
state. I recall it being only a few years ago (then again, time moves
quickly when having this much fun...).
