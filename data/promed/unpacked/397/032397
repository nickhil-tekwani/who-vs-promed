After a case of trichinella infection was detected in a wild boar in the north of La Pampa Province, and in the winter season when backyard slaughtering practices are frequent, the provincial health department warned about the risk of trichinellosis and issued preventive measures.

At this time of the year, the production of homemade sausages and salami from swine and bushmeat is common practice. Because of the recent positive trichinellosis cases detected by the provincial lab, the health department asked to reinforce preventive measures to avoid exposure to the parasite.

Trichinellosis is a disease transmitted by the consumption of raw or undercooked meat of swine or wild animals (as wild boar, armadillos, and pumas), for which the government asked the population to take extreme precautions when using uncooked or undercooked meats, pork meats, sausages, and salted meats, carrying out the necessary controls to verify that the meat is suitable for human consumption. Meat samples can be sent to a local lab to establish the absence of larvae by artificial digestion. This is the only diagnostic method authorized by La Pampa province.

The main clinical signs of trichinellosis are fever, diarrhea, vomiting, eyelid swelling, photophobia, muscle pain. Severe cases may lead to death.

Official statements warn that there have been positive cases in localities where trichinellosis had not been detected in the past.

[The wild boar is an invasive species in Argentina. In endemic areas of trichinellosis, the wild animals that are known to play a role in the maintenance of _Trichinella_ spp. are rats, wild boars (both introduced species), armadillos, and pumas. Wild boars and armadillos are used as a source of animal protein. - Mod.PMB
