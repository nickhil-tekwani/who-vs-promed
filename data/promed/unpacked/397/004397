The summer heat drives people to place like Bolivar Peninsula in Texas to enjoy the Gulf of Mexico. But the warm water is also home to potentially dangerous bacteria. An Oklahoma man said he contracted a bacterium after a family trip to Crystal Beach and nearly lost his leg.

"They had to take lots of skin. They had to do a lot of stuff to me to save my leg, and save me, actually," he said.

He said his trip last month [June 2021] was picture perfect until the day he was heading home to Oklahoma City, when he noticed a rash on his leg. "Nothing real crazy, but got the shivers real bad. Got really, really, just teeth-chattering cold," he said. Over the next 48 hours, things went from bad to worse. "My leg, I had blisters on my leg that were like this big and just distorted my whole leg," he said.

Doctors told him he had been infected with _Vibrio vulnificus_, a bacterium, and they needed to amputate his leg. "They said it's either life or limb, and well, I choose life," he said. Fortunately, after several surgeries and skin grafts, doctors were able to save his leg. "It's about one of the worst things you could ever think about happening with no explanation," he said.

"Anytime you have something living in the water such as sharks and fish, etc., then it's natural for there to be bacteria as well," said Janae Pulliam, health communications specialist at the Galveston County Health District. She said _Vibrio_ is found naturally in salt and brackish water.

While rare, infections affect people with pre-existing health conditions like diabetes, liver disease, or cancer who had open cuts or sores when they came in contact with the bacterium.

"Just be safe about it. For the same reason that you wouldn't just go somewhere when there's no lifeguard on duty, don't go in the water if you have a huge cut on your arm. That's a bad idea," Pulliam said.

Pulliam said don't be afraid to go in the water, just take the necessary precautions to keep you and your family safe.

A Houston-area man is recovering in the hospital after he contracted flesh-eating bacteria while fishing at a Texas beach last week.

KSAT 12â€²s sister station KPRC reported a 68-year-old contracted _Vibrio vulnificus_ twice while surf fishing in the Brazoria County Beach near Surfside Beach.

The man told KPRC that he contracted the bacterium for the 1st time in his right hand over Memorial Day weekend while fishing. He then contracted the bacterium again Wednesday morning [14 Jul 2021] while fishing at the same beach, but this time, in his left hand.

"I finally took my bandages off 2 weeks ago, and I decided I'm a gonna go fishing. And I was very careful. I didn't get this wet. I had it sealed up, and then I got it in the other hand," he said in an interview with KPRC.

He was not sure how he contracted the flesh-eating bacterium because he did not have an open cut or wound. "If somebody starts feeling discomfort and it starts to swell pretty rapidly, go get it checked out because it's very aggressive and it will kill you," he said.

According to the CDC, _Vibrio vulnificus_ can be contracted through open wounds and infections when saltwater containing bacteria comes in contact with the wound. The CDC also said the organism is more likely to affect people with pre-existing conditions such as liver disease, cancer, and diabetes.

[It is unclear if the 2 episodes were confirmed as _V. vulnificus_.

The following is extracted from the "Bad Bug Book," 1st edition, Center for Safety and Applied Nutrition, US FDA (Food and Drug Administration), at https://wayback.archive-it.org/7993/20170406190152/https://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/CausesOfIllnessBadBugBook/ucm070473.htm:

"_Vibrio vulnificus_, a lactose-fermenting, halophilic, Gram-negative, opportunistic pathogen, is found in estuarine environments and associated with various marine species such as plankton, shellfish (oysters, clams, and crabs), and finfish."

"Environmental factors responsible for controlling numbers of _V. vulnificus_ in seafood and in the environment include temperature, pH, salinity, and increased dissolved organics."

"Wound infections result either from contaminating an open wound with sea water harboring the organism, or by lacerating part of the body on coral, fish, etc. followed by contamination with the organism. The ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in gastroenteritis.

"The 'primary septicemia' form of the disease follows consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals with underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease." [The organism can also enter through damaged skin. - Mod.LL]

"In these individuals, the microorganism enters the bloodstream, resulting in septic shock, rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50%). Over 70% of infected individuals have distinctive bullous skin lesions" [shown at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5508923/].

There are 2 points to be emphasized: (1) Vibrios are normal flora in warm saltwater (not indicative of any sewage contamination), and (2) Most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. So-called normal individuals often just develop gastroenteritis. The range of disease due to _V. vulnificus_ may involve more northern geographical areas as overall global warming takes effect. - Mod.LL
