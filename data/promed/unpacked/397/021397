The Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) is reporting a confirmed case of Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV) in a Rhode Island resident. Laboratory testing confirming the diagnosis was conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The person who tested positive was a resident of Washington County in his 50s who developed neurological symptoms and is now recovering. JCV is spread to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito.

JCV is a mosquitoborne pathogen that can be found widely in North America, especially in the Midwest and north eastern United States. The virus circulates primarily between deer and mosquitoes but can also infect humans. Human cases can occur from late spring through mid-fall. People can be infected and not develop any symptoms, or only develop very mild symptoms. Early symptoms can include fever, muscle aches, headaches, and fatigue. Rarely, more serious central nervous system disease, including meningitis or encephalitis, can occur. For more information on Jamestown Canyon Virus, please visit https://www.cdc.gov/jamestown-canyon/index.html.

Protect yourself [from mosquito vectors]:
- Put screens on windows and doors. Fix screens that are loose or have holes.
- At sunrise and sundown (when mosquitoes are most active), consider rescheduling outdoor activities that occur during evening or early morning. If you must be outside, wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants and use bug spray.
- Use EPA-approved bug spray with one of the following active ingredients: DEET (20-30% strength); picaridin, IR3535; and oil of lemon eucalyptus or paramenthane. Always read the label and follow all directions and precautions.
- Do not use bug spray with DEET on infants under 2 months of age. Children should be careful not to rub their eyes after bug spray has been applied on their skin. Wash children's hands with soap and water to remove any bug spray when they return indoors.
- Put mosquito netting over playpens and baby carriages.

Remove mosquito breeding grounds:
- Remove items around your house and yard that collect water. Just one cup of water can produce hundreds of mosquitoes; an unused tire containing water can produce thousands of mosquitoes.
- Clean your gutters and downspouts so that they can drain properly.
- Remove any water from unused swimming pools, wading pools, boats, planters, trash and recycling bins, tires, and anything else that collects water, and cover them.
- Remove or treat any shallow water that can accumulate on top of a pool cover. Larvicide treatments, such as Mosquito Dunks, can be applied to kill immature mosquitoes. This environmentally friendly product is available at many hardware and garden stores and online.
- Clean and change water in birdbaths at least once a week.
- Remove or cover areas where standing water can collect.

Visit <health.ri.gov/mosquito> for additional mosquito prevention tips, videos, and local data. Mosquitoes are trapped weekly by the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) and tested at the RIDOH State Health Laboratories. DEM issues advisories on test results from June through September, with additional reports as necessary. Typically, positive test results trigger additional trapping to assess risk.

[Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV) clinical infections in humans occur sporadically in the north eastern USA. Cases in Rhode Island are rare. Fortunately, this patient is recovering. According to CDC, "Cases occur from late spring through mid-fall. Fever, headache, and fatigue are common symptoms of Jamestown Canyon virus disease. Jamestown Canyon virus can cause severe disease, including encephalitis (inflammation of the brain). There are no vaccines to prevent or medicines to treat Jamestown Canyon virus infection. Reduce your risk of infection by preventing mosquito bites." (https://www.cdc.gov/jamestown-canyon/index.html)

Deaths from Jamestown Canyon virus are very rare but do occur; see Jamestown Canyon virus - USA (02): (NH) fatal 20210811.8587561.

As noted in previous ProMED posts, JCV was first isolated from a pool of 9 _Culiseta inornata_ mosquitoes captured in Jamestown Canyon, Colorado, in 1961 and later shown to be widely distributed in the eastern and midwestern USA. Boreal (northern) aedes and ochlerotatus mosquitoes are the primary vectors. As with the other California serogroup orthobunyaviruses, transovarial virus transmission is common, with newly emerging female mosquitoes already infected with the virus in the spring and ready to transmit it. White-tailed deer, _Odocoileus virginianus_, are the principal amplification hosts.

As Drs Charles Calisher and Paul Grimstad pointed out in ProMED post Jamestown Canyon virus, mosquitoes - USA (NY) (03) 20040807.2171, JCV frequently seems to be forgotten as an etiological agent of human disease. That post provides related references. - Mod.TY
