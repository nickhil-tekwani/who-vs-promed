Another case of livestock disease bluetongue has been detected in a
calf in Austria, the 2nd within the space of just over a month, the
Health Ministry said Friday [12 Dec 2008]. This time, a 2-month-old
calf in Bregenz in the western province of Vorarlberg tested positive
for the disease, but is not yet showing any visible symptoms, the
ministry said in a statement. The mother cow had not been vaccinated
at the time of the calf's birth.

Already in November [2008], the disease was detected in a cow in
Schaerding, Upper Austria, during a routine check by the national
Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety (AGES).

Bluetongue is a non-contagious, insect-borne, viral disease that
affects ruminants such as cows and sheep but not pigs or horses. It
is difficult to control once it takes hold. It is not a risk to
humans, but in animals it causes high fevers, mouth ulcers, and swollen heads.

Since July [2008], vaccination against bluetongue has been compulsory
in the provinces of Tyrol and Vorarlberg after the disease was
detected in Austria's neighbours in 2006 and 2007. The vaccination
will be compulsory in the whole of Austria from 15 Dec 2008.

The economical impact of BTV-8 on French cattle and sheep
---------------------------------------------------------
[For the names of the authors, go to the URL above]

The consequences of the bluetongue are measurable in all fields of
study, with deaths up to 25 percent in sheep, up to 13 percent in
suckling cattle [that is, beef cows with calves at foot. - Rapp.SB],
and 16 percent in dairy cows.

For the 1st time, a techno-economic study of the consequences of
bluetongue disease evaluates that there is between 6 and 18 percent
reduction of gross profit margin in farms with suckling cattle and
between 1 and 8 percent decline in dairy farming. In critical cases,
the losses will be up to 43 percent in suckling livestock and 12
percent in dairy cattle.

The crisis has had, and will continue to have, a major impact in
cattle. The direct impacts concern the production and/or marketing,
but the indirect effects by decreased fertility will be just as
damaging. The drop in fertility is already being felt: lower success
rates in IA [artificial insemination], more abortions. "These details
make us fear a major impact of the bluetongue [disease] on
reproduction, with possible medium term repercussions with shortage
of animals due to abortions, or lengthening the intercalving periods.

The estimated direct effects on milk production were studied in the
Picardy (region of northeastern France. - Rapp.SB), where 10 percent
reduction was seen in cows ill for 3 weeks. The losses are rather
difficult to assess in the beef sector, but the data indicate a 23
percent decrease in export volume. Weight gain is affected; there are
direct impacts on prices and the effects on the entire industry are
already visible. Workload is increased by an average of 1.5 hour
daily [per holding].

[3] EU BTV vaccination policy revision

Bluetongue: EU to rewrite vaccination and livestock movement rules
------------------------------------------------------------------
Brussels bureaucrats have voted to rewrite bluetongue vaccination
laws and stock movement rules.

A meeting of the Standing Committee on Food Chain and Animal Health
[SCOFCAH] voted on 3 Dec 2008 for changes and details are beginning to emerge.

It appears movement rules for importing livestock into the UK could
be tightened up, at odds with current free trade rules.

One Brussels official explained that certain areas of the EU would
eventually be able to vaccinate animals while still allowing
authorities to impose extra conditions on importing from zones where
the disease was known to circulate.

But the official stressed this should not be seen as a mechanism to
introduce a ban on imports.

"It will mean that some areas which have begun vaccinating will no
longer have to freely accept stock from infected areas, as is
currently the case.

"If that vaccination area could prove the disease is not circulating
it could impose extra conditions on the import of stock from infected
areas once the law is changed," he said.

How the areas are to be defined is yet to be agreed. "It may be on a
county or regional basis. For example, if one area is vaccinating
against BTV-8 and could prove that the disease was not circulating it
could impose new restrictions on imports from areas known to be
infected with BTV-8.

"This could mean that areas like the southeast of England would find
it harder to prove that the disease was not present than, say,
Scotland," he said.

"The vote will need further work to define the rules precisely and
the new vaccination zones will not become law for at least one month
maybe as long as 2 months."

A UK farming industry official added that the proposals would take
time to decipher.

"Exactly what this law could mean for trade between member states and
indeed within the UK itself is still unclear," he said.

"We don't want more zones that make trade more complex, we have had
enough of zones and people are fed up with it."

A spokesman for the Scottish government said it had interpreted the
vote as meaning that imports would be restricted to vaccinated
animals or free transport during the vector-free period only.

"The development is therefore welcome and our hope is it can be
applied to Scotland retrospectively," the spokesman said.

"There remain concerns regarding the practicalities of implementing
the new zones and we will be studying the detail closely to determine
how this development can best be used to support Scotland's interests."

1. Bluetongue Europe: NL / FR / BE / CZ / DE / PT / GR / DK / UK
----------------------------------------------------------------
Netherlands
-----------
As of 2 Dec 2008, 58 BTV-8, 14 BTV-6, and 1 BTV-1 cases have been
officially detected in the Netherlands. BTV-6 seems to be widespread
in the Netherlands. It remains unclear whether the BTV-6 is vaccine
virus, a vaccine virus that has regained virulence, or a field virus.
Several studies need to be verified, full results are expected during
the course of December 2008. The origin of BTV-1 is a bull from
France. Following the discovery of BTV-1, investigations started and
revealed that no spread of BTV-1 has occurred.
More details, [including maps and the evolution of BTV-6], can be
found in the presentation given by the Dutch authorities at the
Standing Committee of 2-3 December 2008 [see
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations/bt_23122008_nl.pdf>].

France
------
As of 2-3 Dec 2008, 24 469 BTV-8 and 4469 BTV-1 outbreaks have been

As reported by the French delegate to the EU Standing Committee on
the Food Chain and Animal Health (SCFCAH), during the 2-3 Dec 2008
meeting in Brussels, the vaccination against BTV-1 and BTV-8 is
compulsory on the whole French territory, the supply of the doses
will start on November-December 2008, and all the animals must be
compulsorily vaccinated before 30 Apr 2009.
More details [in particular detailed maps] can be found in the
presentation given by the French authorities at the Standing
Committee of 2-3 December 2008 [see
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations/bt_23122008_fr.pdf>].

Belgium
-------
As of 2-3 December 2008, the Belgian authorities have informed on a
suspicion of BTV-6 in 2 calves originated from the Netherlands. The
necessary measures have been adopted. The competent authorities of
the NL were informed. The pending results will be available soon. As
of 27 Nov 2008, 1 855 565 animals have been vaccinated in Belgium.
More details can be found in the presentation given by the French
authorities at the Standing Committee of 2-3 Dec 2008 [see

Czech Republic
--------------
As of 2-3 December 2008, 21 BTV-8 cases have been officially detected
in the Czech Republic. The whole territory of the Czech Republic has
been considered to be protection zone. Vaccination is mandatory for
cattle, sheep, and goats over 3 months of age. The number of animals
vaccinated until 21 Nov 2008: cattle 1 236 015 (85.6 percent), sheep
and goats 211 050 (96 percent). The State Veterinary Administration
of the Czech Republic applied vector free period from 1 Dec 2008.
More details can be found in the presentation given by the Czech
authorities at the Standing Committee of 2-3 December 2008 [see
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations/bt_23122008_cz.pdf>].

Germany
-------
As of 2-3 December 2008, 2487 new BTV-8 cases have been officially
detected in Germany in 2008 (322 cases in November). As of 18 Nov
2008, the German authorities have confirmed the presence of BTV-6 in
2 cattle originating from the Netherlands.
More details [including detailed maps] can be found in the
presentation given by the German authorities at the Standing
Committee of 2-3 December 2008 [see
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations/bt_23122008_de.pdf>].

Portugal
--------
As of 2-3 Dec 2008, the Portuguese authorities have informed on 52
outbreaks of BTV-1 (644 affected animals) in Portugal. As of 27 Nov
2008, 146 275 small ruminants (35.34 percent) have been vaccinated in
the new restricted area S1 (yellow area in the map) against BTV-1.
More details [and the mentioned map] can be found in the presentation
given by the Portuguese authorities at the Standing Committee of 2-3
Dec 2008 [see
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations/bt_23122008_nl.pdf>].

Greece
------
As of 2-3 Dec 2008, the Greek Authorities have confirmed the presence
of BTV-16 on the island of Lesbos. All necessary measures have been
taken in accordance with Council Directive 2000/75/EC. The whole
territory of the island of Lesbos has been considered to be
restricted zone. The evolution of the disease in Lesbos is continued.
More details can be found in the presentation given by the Greek
authorities at the standing committee of 2-3 Dec 2008 [see
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations/bt_23122008_el.pdf>].

Denmark
-------
As of 2-3 Dec 2008, the Danish authorities have reported 15 outbreaks
in Denmark in 2008. Vaccination is mandatory in Denmark; all cattle
have to [be vaccinated] before 1 Jul 2009 and all sheep and goats
before 1 Aug 2009. Denmark will not ask for EU co-financing
vaccination in 2009.
More details can be found in the presentation given by the Danish
authorities at the standing committee of 2-3 Dec 2008 [see
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations/bt_23122008_dk.pdf>].

United Kingdom
--------------
As of 2-3 Dec 2008, the British authorities have confirmed the
discovery of BTV-1 in 5 imported cattle from southwest France on a
farm near Blackpool. It is the 1st time that BTV-1 has been found in
the UK. The discovery will be a major worry to livestock farmers, as
there is currently no BTV-1 vaccine available for use in the UK.
There was no evidence of the disease circulation, virus isolation is
ongoing. Defra (UK Department for Environment, Food, and Rural
Affairs) will work to establish how the infected cattle arrived in
the UK after it emerged they were vaccinated against BTV-1 in France.
As of 24 Nov 2008, 148 BTV-8 outbreaks have been officially detected
in the UK and Wales. Vaccination against BTV-8 in the UK and Wales is
voluntary. Scotland has compulsory vaccination, which started on 3 Nov 2008.
More details can be found in the presentation given by the British
authorities at the standing committee of 2-3 Dec 2008 [see
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations/bt_23122008_uk.pdf>].


2. Bluetongue: start of the seasonally vector free period
---------------------------------------------------------
The decision to apply a vector-free season is based on a careful
evaluation from a National Veterinary Institute of the current
epidemiological and entomological situation and following the
application of the criteria listed in annex V of the Commission
Regulation (EC 1266/2007) [see commentary].

Sweden
------
As of 18 Nov 2008, the Swedish authorities have informed on the
seasonally vector-free period as from 15 Nov 2008.

[According to EU Commission Regulation (EC) 1266/2007, 'bluetongue
seasonally-free zone' means an epidemiological relevant geographical
area of a Member State for which, for a part of the year,
surveillance demonstrates no evidence of bluetongue virus
transmission or of adult _Culicoides_ likely to be competent
bluetongue vectors". During the seasonally vector-free period, the
requirements for exported animals are somewhat alleviated; for
details, see annex III [ "Conditions for exemption from the exit ban
referred to in Articles 7(2)(a) and 8(1)(a) of (EC) 1266/2007") as
amended in Regulation 289/2008 of Apr 2008, available at
