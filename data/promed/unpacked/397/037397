Severe acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide
---------------------------------------------
We are able to confirm that the patient whose NPA [nasophayngeal aspirate]
was found to contain paramyxovirus is a health care worker with SARS who
was exposed to the index patient in the medical ward associated with the
outbreak at the Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong. Degenerated primer
sets for paramyxoviruses were used in a RT-PCR [real-time polymerase chain
reaction] in the patient's NPA. Multiple bands from the PCR product were
sequenced. A sequence was found to be compatible to paramyxoviruses.
Subsequent application of this RT-PCR in specimens collected from three
other health care workers who were exposed in the same medical ward and
presenting symptoms of SARS showed similar bands. Sequencing of these PCR
products are in progress.

Suspected SARS - Germany ex Singapore via New York
--------------------------------------------------
In addition to finding paramyxovirus-like particles in throat swabs and
sputum specimens from the doctor from Singapore and his mother-in-law
currently treated in the isolation unit in Frankfurt am Main, Germany,
similar structures have now been identified in the plasma of the mother-in-law.
Although further testing to confirm the finding of what could potentially
constitute a novel paramyxovirus (as the presence of known human-pathogenic
paramyxoviruses was largely ruled out by using a multitude of other tests)
is urgently needed and under way in several laboratories, the detection of
such particles in the blood might indicate active viremia and thus
underline a potentially causative role for the agent.

Preliminary investigations by the Pathology Department at the Singapore
General Hospital and the Defence Medical Research Institute have identified
the likely infective agent to belong to the paramyxovirus family. This
corroborates early investigation results by overseas centers in Germany and
Hong Kong.

Preliminary findings suggest a viral cause
------------------------------------------
Research teams at two laboratories, in Germany and Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region of China, have detected particles of a virus from the
Paramyxoviridae family in samples taken from patients with severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS).
This is the first major step forward in efforts to pinpoint the causative
agent. Previous tests conducted in a number of top laboratories failed to
detect the presence of any known bacteria or viruses, including the
influenza viruses, recognized as causes of pneumonia or respiratory
symptoms, or known to be widespread in the most affected geographical areas.
The failure of all previous efforts to detect the presence of bacteria and
viruses known to cause respiratory disease strongly suggests that the
causative agent may be a novel pathogen.
Firm conclusions about the identity of the causative agent are premature.
All teams have stressed that these are preliminary results only. Further
studies are needed before it can be concluded, with confidence, that the
causative agent has been identified.
Collaborative efforts continue. All research teams are participants in the
international multicentre SARS research project, linking together 11
leading laboratories, that was set up on Monday 17 Mar 2003. Coordinated
research is expected to expedite definitive identification of the causative
agent.
The detection of paramyxovirus particles in samples from infected patients
is the first lead to a possible cause of SARS and will be extremely
important in focusing ongoing research. Definitive identification of the
causative agent will help physicians move from the current "hit-or-miss"
approach to treatment to a more precise selection of drugs with a greater
prospect of cure. Knowledge of the causative agent will also speed
development of a diagnostic test and thus give physicians and national
health authorities a powerful tool for the identification of cases. It will
also reassure the many "worried well" now presenting at health facilities,
and reduce the number of false alarms.
Update on countries and cases
As of Wednesday 19 Mar 2003, a cumulative total of 264 suspected or
probable cases and 9 deaths have been reported from 10 countries (Canada,
China, Germany Singapore, Slovenia, Spain, Thailand, the United Kingdom,
the United States of America, and Viet Nam). Hong Kong SAR, Hanoi (Viet
Nam), and Singapore continue to be the most affected areas. Full details
are provided in tabular form.
Awareness of the disease is now very high throughout the world.
Surveillance is proving to be sensitive, with suspected cases rapidly
detected, reported to national authorities and WHO, and investigated
according to the standard case definition.
The Paramyxoviridae family
Viruses in the Paramyxoviridae family include many common, well-known
agents associated with respiratory infections, such as respiratory
syncytial virus, and childhood illnesses, including the viruses that cause
mumps and measles. Some of these viruses are widespread, particularly
during the winter season. Screening of specimens could therefore be
expected to detect particles of these common viruses. At this point, it
cannot be ruled out entirely that tests for the SARS agent are detecting
such "background" viruses rather than the true causative agent.
The Paramyxoviridae family also includes two recently recognized pathogens,
Hendra virus and Nipah virus. These related viruses are unusual in the
family in that they can infect and cause potentially fatal disease in a
number of animal hosts, including humans. Most other viruses in the family
tend to infect a single animal species only.
Nipah virus first began to cause deaths in humans in Peninsular Malaysia in
1998 in persons in close contact with pigs. The outbreak caused 265 cases
of human encephalitis, including 105 deaths. Two separate outbreaks of
Hendra virus, associated with severe respiratory disease in horses, caused
two human deaths in Australia in 1994 and 1995. No human-to-human
transmission was documented in either outbreak. No treatment was available
for cases caused by either of these two viruses. Human-to-human
transmission did not occur.

[ProMED-mail thanks Drs Tam and Chan for submitting this first hand report
on their preliminary findings of RT-PCR findings consistent with a
paramyxovirus from 4 patients with SARS in Hong Kong SAR. This is the first
confirmation of viral RNA from multiple patients and is very promising. (An
excellent review article on RT-PCR is available online: Mackay IM, Arden
KE, Nitsche A. Real time PCR in virology. Nucleic Acids Research 2002;
30(6): 1292-1305 <http://www.wzw.tum.de/gene-quantification/mackay-2002.pdf>).
We also thank Dr Doerr and colleagues for submitting their first hand
report of the electron microscopy identification of paramyxovirus particles
from plasma in one of the cases of SARS undergoing hospital treatment in
Germany. As their report states this may be indicative of a viremia
(circulation of the virus in the blood stream consistent with an acute
infection with the virus).
In addition, we have also included information from the Singapore Ministry
of Health website mentioning that a paramyxovirus has been preliminarily
identified from patient(s?) in Singapore. While specifics on the testing
used in Singapore are not available in the MOH press release, this is now
the third location to preliminarily identify paramyxovirus from specimens
taken from SARS patients.
Once a viral agent has been identified and confirmed from multiple
patients, in multiple geographic locations and specific tests for the virus
have been developed, more of the suspected cases of SARS can be tested to
see if they have evidence of recent infection with the identified virus.
This "step-wise" process is important to confirm that the agent is in fact
the agent responsible for SARS. - Mod.MPP]
[Evidence is accumulating that the etiologic agent of SARS is a
paramyxovirus. The report from Germany suggests that known paramyxovirus
pathogens of humans have been excluded. The report from Hong Kong is rather
vague and difficult to evaluate in the absence of precise information on
the nature of the PCR-primers employed or the identity of the product
sequenced. The limited evidence available at present suggests that the
putative agent of SARS is a novel paramyxovirus rather than a known
paramyxovirus exhibiting atypical pathogenicity. A variety of novel
paramyxoviruses have been characterized in recent years, some of which have
been listed in my comment to "PRO/EDR> Severe acute respiratory syndrome -
worldwide (06) 20030318.0677. - Mod.CP].
