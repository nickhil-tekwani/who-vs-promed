The Sindh Health Department confirmed on [Mon 4 Jun 2018] that the 'brain-eating' amoeba, called _Naegleria fowleri_, claimed its 2nd victim in Karachi. "This is the 2nd life claimed by naegleria this year [2018] in Karachi," confirmed Dr Zafar Mehdi, the focal person for naegleria-related deaths in Sindh.

The recent victim of the deadly disease was [a] 16 year old girl from North Nazimabad. Dr Mehdi said that [the deceased] was admitted to a hospital with the symptoms of high fever, vomiting, and nausea. She was shifted to a private hospital in Karachi on [probably 30 May 2018].

_Naegleria fowleri_, claimed the 1st life of the year [2018] in Karachi as a 40-year old person died due to the infection last month [May 2018].

Naegleria, or the brain eating amoeba infection [primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, PAM], is caused by the amoeba found in untreated municipal water, untreated well water, untreated swimming pools and spas, as well as in warm lakes and mud puddles. Pools of stagnant water accumulating on roads and poor sanitation in congested areas increase the risk of the infection as the amoeba thrives in warm and polluted water.

Dr Zafar Mehdi stressed the immediate adaptation of required measures for naegleria prevention and control. "The Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB) should come forward and start chlorinating water supplied to the residents of Karachi. It is the only way to protect them from naegleria since the cure for naegleria is unavailable," said Dr Mehdi. He said that those who cannot afford to put chlorine tablets in their water storage tanks can put 2 spoons of bleach powder in a jug of water, mix that solution in water storage tanks at night, and use the water after few hours. He said that urgent measures were needed for proper chlorination of water supplied to the residents of Karachi. "Attention should also be directed towards adequate treatment of water that is used for bathing, face washing, swimming" added Dr Mehdi. "Water that can in any manner enter into nostrils of a person has to be treated before use," said Dr Zafar Mehdi.

[As the temperatures get extremely hot in Sindh and other parts of the country, the detection of this new case of PAM is not unexpected. Unless optimum water chlorination is made a standard and routine practice, control of the parasite in warm and humid environment can continue unchecked. Optimum chlorination is the key measure to prevent _Naegleria fowleri_ infection.

Public awareness messages from the Government of Sindh Health Department are being aired in electronic media to increase public awareness (https://www.geo.tv/latest/138058-First-death-of-2017-from-Naegleria-in-Karachi).

The following measures are recommended to prevent infection:
- avoid water activities in pools, ponds and water or untreated water;
- keep head above water or use a nose clip when the water is warm or the temperature is near or above 80 deg F (about 27 deg C);
- use distilled, sterile, or previously boiled and cooled water for nasal rinses; (less likely to be practical than chlorination)
- periodic cleaning of water tanks and chlorinating water. - Mod.UBA
