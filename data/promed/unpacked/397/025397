From: Walter J. Tabachnick <Tabachni@uwyo.edu>

Rural outbreaks of dengue occurred in Asia prior to the introduction of
_Aedes aegypti_. C.E.G. Smith (Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 59:3-11. 1956)
provided an excellent review of the history of dengue in Asia. The vector
of the rural epidemics was likely _Ae. albopictus_, a rural vector of the
dengue viruses and native to the region. Urban dengue epidemics were not
known to occur in Asia until the latter half of the nineteenth century.
Smith attributes this to the arrival of the only vector capable of urban
endemicity, _Ae. aegypti_. A more detailed discussion of the evolution of
_Ae. aegypti_ can be found in Tabachnick, W.J., Amer. Entomol. 37:14-24. 1991.

[Duane Gubler also responded to my question, saying that there are three
excellent natural experiments with _Aedes albopictus_ and dengue, four if
you count Brazil. Hawaii and Guam have had only _Ae. albopictus_ for more
than 50 years, with no _Ae. aegypti_. Although epidemic dengue has
occurred all around them on islands where _Ae. aegypti_ was present,
neither has had an outbreak of dengue since 1944. Taiwan is another case
in point. _Ae.aegypti_ occurs only in the south of the island; _Ae.
albopictus occurs all over the island. The epidemics of dengue in Taiwan,
since reintroduction of dengue in 1981, have all been in the south. In
1996 and 1997, there was local transmission of dengue in Taipei where only
_Ae. albopictus_ supposedly occurred, but the cases were sporadic and few
in number.
