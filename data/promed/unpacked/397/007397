New Niger bird flu outbreak near Nigeria - official
-----------------------------------------------
Scientists in Europe have confirmed a new outbreak of deadly H5N1
bird flu in southern Niger, near the border with Africa's most
populous country, Nigeria, a senior local government official said on
Friday [2 Jun 2006].
Tests carried out in Europe confirmed the presence of H5N1 in samples
taken from the village of Boko Mai Gao, around 10 km (6 miles) from
the border with Nigeria's Kano state, said the official, who declined
to be named.
The discovery comes 3 days after Niger, landlocked and among the
poorest countries on earth, described its epidemiological situation
as "calm."
The H5N1 strain of bird flu was 1st confirmed in Niger in late
February 2006, but it took until April 2006 to start culling poultry
in the affected areas.
Scientists worry that poor health and veterinary systems in Africa
could allow the virus to spread undetected among millions of domestic
fowl living in houses and back yards.
Several countries in West Africa, including Niger's neighbors Nigeria
and Burkina Faso, have confirmed outbreaks of the deadly H5N1 bird
flu, but so far no cases have been detected among humans.
The only human cases confirmed so far on the African continent have
been in Egypt, where 6 people have died out of 14 known human
infections, and one in Djibouti, according to the World Health
Organization, which says at least 124 people have been killed around
the world since 2003.
