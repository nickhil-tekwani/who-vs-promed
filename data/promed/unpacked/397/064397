Yellow fever - Uganda
------------------
Outbreak at a glance:

On 6 Mar 2022, WHO received notification from the Uganda Ministry of Health of 4 suspected yellow fever cases. As of 25 Apr 2022, a total of 7 suspected cases tested positive for yellow fever antibodies by plaque reduction neutralization test. However, further investigations identified only one laboratory-confirmed case of yellow fever reported from Wakiso district, Central Region. The MoH declared an outbreak, and a rapid response team was deployed to the affected districts. Due to the potential of epidemic spread in Uganda and the risk of spread to neighboring countries, WHO assesses the risk to be high at the national and regional levels.

Outbreak overview:

On 6 Mar 2022, the Uganda Ministry of Health (MoH) notified WHO of 4 suspected yellow fever cases, with specimens collected between 2 Jan - 18 Feb 2022, which tested positive for yellow fever antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) at the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI). As of 25 Mar 2022, 3 additional samples, with specimens collected between 1-13 Oct 2021, tested positive for antibodies by PRNT at the UVRI. All the 7 suspected cases tested negative [for yellow fever virus RNA sequences] by polymerase chain reaction.

Cases presented with symptoms including fever, vomiting, nausea, diarrhoea, intense fatigue, anorexia, abdominal pain, chest pain, muscle pain, headache, and sore throat. None of the cases presented with severe yellow fever symptoms of acute jaundice.

The majority of the suspected cases were females (n=6) with an age range between 15-57 years. Of these, 5 were reported from Wakiso district, and one each from Masaka and Kasese districts.

Of the 7 suspected cases, epidemiological investigations were conducted for 6 cases, and investigation is pending on one case. As of 25 Apr 2022, 5 of the 6 cases investigated had a recent history of vaccination and were consequently discarded in the absence of evidence suggesting vaccination failure, and one case (reported from Wakiso district) was confirmed as yellow fever.

Epidemiology of yellow fever:

Yellow fever is an epidemic-prone, mosquito-borne, vaccine-preventable disease caused by an arbovirus transmitted to humans by the bites of infected _Aedes_ and _Haemagogus_ mosquitoes. Once contracted, the yellow fever virus incubates in the body for 3-6 days. The majority of infections are asymptomatic, but when symptoms occur, the most common are fever, muscle pain with prominent backache, headache, loss of appetite, and nausea or vomiting. In most cases, symptoms disappear after 3-4 days.

A small proportion of patients, however, can have more severe symptoms of high-grade fever, abdominal pain with vomiting, jaundice and dark urine caused by acute liver and kidney failure. Death could occur within 7-10 days in about half of the patients with severe symptoms. There is currently no specific anti-viral drug for yellow fever, but early supportive treatment, such as specific care to treat dehydration, fever, and liver and kidney failure could improve survival rates.

Forty countries globally, 27 in Africa and 13 in Central and South America, are classified as high-risk for yellow fever. Since September 2021, 13 countries in the WHO African Region have reported probable and confirmed yellow fever cases and outbreaks, including an ongoing outbreak under close investigation in neighbouring Kenya. These outbreaks are occurring in large geographic areas of the Western, Central, and Eastern regions of Africa. They have affected areas that have previously conducted large-scale mass vaccination campaigns but with persistent and growing gaps in immunity due to lack of sustained population immunity through routine immunization and/or secondary to population movements (newcomers without history of vaccination). These reports indicate a resurgence and intensified transmission of the yellow fever virus.

Public health response:

After the Uganda MoH declared a yellow fever outbreak in the country, they activated the Public Health Emergency Operation center. They are also deploying a rapid response team to affected districts where all cases were reported to determine the extent of the outbreak, identify the at-risk population, conduct a risk assessment, initiate risk communication and community engagement activities, and implement integrated vector control measures.

Yellow fever vaccine has not been introduced into the Uganda routine immunization schedule; however, the country has an imminent plan to introduce it in mid-2022, followed by phased mass vaccination campaigns (PMVCs). Pending the evolution of the situation and response planning, a request maybe submitted to the International Coordinating Group (ICG) on vaccine provision for preventive yellow fever vaccination in areas as indicated by ongoing investigations.

WHO risk assessment:

Uganda is endemic for yellow fever and is classified as a high-risk country in the Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemics (EYE) Strategy. The country has history of outbreaks reported in 2020 (Buliisa, Maracha, and Moyo districts), 2019 (Masaka and Koboko districts), 2016 (Masaka, Rukungiri, and Kalangala districts), and in 2010, when 10 districts were affected in Northern Uganda.

The confirmed case is reported from Wakiso district, close to the greater Kampala metropolitan area. The district also includes Entebbe, where the international airport is located.

Uganda has not introduced the yellow fever vaccine into routine immunization, and the estimated overall population immunity is low (4.2%), and attributable to past reactive vaccination activities supported by ICG in focal districts including Yumbe, Moyo, Buliisa, Maracha, Koboko (2020), Masaka, and Koboko (2019), in limited scope in the Greater Kampala area (2017), Masaka, Rukungiri, and Kalangala districts (2016).

[It is interesting that only one of 7 suspected yellow fever (YF) cases was subsequently shown to be positive. Even a single case is a cause for concern, given the potential for rapid spread among unvaccinated people in the community. Deployment of the rapid response team to determine if other cases are occurring is prudent as is introduction of YF vaccination into the routine vaccination schedule.

As noted earlier, yellow fever is no stranger in Uganda, and outbreaks occur sporadically. Recent previous outbreaks were reported in 2020 and in May 2019 after laboratory-confirmed cases. These cases and the current ones are spillover from endemic sylvan (forest) maintenance of the virus. Maintaining adequate vaccination coverage in these areas is important to prevent initiation of urban transmission of the virus, which can quickly get out of hand. The Ministry of Health would be wise to increase YF surveillance and to mount a prompt vaccination campaign. The current vaccination coverage is reported as low and far short of the 80% that would provide adequate immunity for the population. - Mod.TY
