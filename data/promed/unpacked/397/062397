Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: an investigation was carried out on the presence of OIE avian diseases in Tahiti in the avifauna in 4 wild bird species (365 animals sampled): rock pigeon (_Columba livia_), common myna (_Acridotheres tristis_), red-vented bulbul (_Pycnonotus cafer_), and zebra dove (_Geopelia striata_). The presence of _Chlamydophila psittaci_ has been only detected in rock pigeons in 2 locations -- in the sanitary landfill in Paihoro and in the coastal area of Paea. Shipment of Columbidae, Psittacidae, and Anatidae from Tahiti towards the other islands has been suspended.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; zoning; no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[Avian chlamydiosis (AC) is a zoonotic disease of birds caused by the intracellular bacterium _Chlamydophila psittaci_. It is particularly common in the orders Psittaciformes (psittacine birds) and Columbiformes (pigeons and doves). This disease is called psittacosis in humans (http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/chlamydiosis_avian.pdf).

Infection of birds with _Chlamydophila psittaci_ is common all over the world and has been found in about 465 avian species. Outbreaks of AC in psittacine birds and domestic poultry farms cause considerable economic damage. The infection can lead to systemic and occasionally fatal disease in birds. The clinical signs are generally nonspecific and vary greatly in severity, depending on the species and age of the bird and the strain of chlamydia. AC can produce lethargy, hyperthermia, abnormal excretions, nasal, and eye discharges, and reduced egg production. Mortality rates will vary greatly.

For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to OIE's Terrestrial Manual 2012, Chapter 2.3.1 "Avian Chlamydiosis" at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.03.01_AVIAN_CHLAMYD.pdf (version adopted by the World Assembly of Delegates of the OIE in May 2012).

OIE's internationally agreed requirements pertaining to AC are spelled out in chapter 10.1 of OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code, available at http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.10.1.htm.

_Chlamydophila psittaci_ is a long-known human pathogen. The risk of psittacosis is highest among people who are exposed to birds or their tissues; this group includes bird owners, veterinarians, laboratory workers, pet shop employees, and poultry workers (including workers in processing plants). Infections can occur after transient exposure. Humans usually become infected after inhaling contaminated dust, feathers, or aerosolized secretions and excretions. Direct contact with infected birds, including bites, can also spread the disease.

Some cases are asymptomatic. Clinical cases vary from a mild, flu-like illness to severe atypical pneumonia with dyspnea. In uncomplicated infections, the illness usually lasts approximately 7 to 10 days, and may be self-limiting. Complications can also occur. Pregnant women may give birth prematurely, and fetal death is possible. Endocarditis, myocarditis, renal disease, hepatitis, anemia, and neurologic signs may also be seen. Before the use of antibiotics, the case fatality rate was 15-20 percent in the general population and it was as high as 80 percent in pregnant women; however, treated cases are rarely fatal. Convalescence may be slow after severe disease (http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/chlamydiosis_avian.pdf).
