A total of 6 cases of peste des petits ruminants (PPR) were discovered and confirmed during the past week in the locality of Ain Kheyar (wilaya of El Tarf), reported the APS on Friday [4 Jan 2019], citing the director Agricultural Services (ASD).

The results of analyzes of samples taken from sheep in Ain Kheyar, from the alert given, confirmed that 6 head of sheep are suffering from PPR, said Kameleddine Benseghir. In the same context, he said that a suspicion of a PPR outbreak in Chihani commune was also reported, detailing that 25 head of sheep from this area have undergone the usual analyzes in such a case to confirm or to invalidate the existence of this pathology.

A "special device" was immediately set in motion, Benseghir added, saying that the measures include the closing of the weekly livestock markets in Bouhadjar, Ain Assel, and Drean for a month in addition to the inter-wilayas movement ban and the obligation to issue a permit from the relevant services for any transport of livestock to the slaughterhouse.

The same official also mentioned the mobilization of a monitoring brigade at the level of the dairas of the wilaya (subdivision of a province) in order to preserve the livestock.
