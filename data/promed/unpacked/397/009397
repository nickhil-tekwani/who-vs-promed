WEST NILE VIRUS, NEW WORLD: RECENT?

It seems obvious that West Nile virus (WNV) first occurred in human[s] in
New York City last fall. However, there are some points about WNV in North
America which have not yet been discussed.
In the 1950's, experiments with WNV were carried out on human volunteers at
the Sloan-Kettering Institute of the Memorial Center for Cancer and Allied
Diseases, New York. A total of 95 patients with neoplastic disease were
inoculated intramuscularly with the WNV topotype strain Eg-101 in an effort
to achieve therapeutic pyrexia and oncolysis in them. Viremia persisted in
a majority of them 6-12 days post-inoculation, in eight patients even more
than 12 days p.i.(maximum, 28 days p.i. in one patient), and titers were
2-5 logs mouse i.c. LD50 (per 0.1 ml?) blood. No special precautions
against mosquitoes were mentioned in the papers.
Moreover, it is possible that WNV circulated in the New York area without
marked signs of its presence at least since the mid-summer 1999 or even (a
year?) before. Theoretically, WNV was for the first time detected in the
U.S.A. in 1999 simply because of the extent of the outbreak.
In conclusion, it has not yet been documented that WNV first occurred in
the New World in 1999. I would therefore dare to suggest that all past
isolates of St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) be checked whether a few
of them are not, in fact, WNV (Remember the original misidentification of
WNV as SLEV virus in New York). Further, studies should be carried out on
representative archived sera positive for antibodies against SLEV to
demonstrate whether, again, some of them have not been, in fact, antibodies
to WNV.
For instance, plaque-reduction neutralization microtest is probably one of
the best, relatively simple methods to differentiate antibodies against
these two antigenically closely related and cross-reacting mosquito-borne
flaviviruses.
This combined approach (examination of SLEV strains and antibodies,
collected before 1999) might trace the real history of WNV in the New World.

[Nice idea to retest archived samples. However, CDC is already doing just
that. As for the work by Chester Southam and Alice Moore, they were very
careful workers and I expect they took the possibility of mosquito
transmission into their plans. As that work was done at least 50 years
ago, I would have expected to hear from WNV before last summer. Most
importantly, WNV from the recent NY City outbreak has been shown by Ian
Lipkin, by CDC workers, and by others to be essentially identical to a
recent strain from a goose in Israel, and dissimilar from the Egypt 101
strain that Southam and Moore used. I know of no isolations of St. Louis
encephalitis virus from material collected in NY City, so comparisons are
impossible. String cut. - Mod.CHC]
