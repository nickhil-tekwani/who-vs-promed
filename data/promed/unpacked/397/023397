The post on vancomycin-resistant _S. aureus_ in Hong Kong [ref.(03) above
was
incorrect in a number of significant areas. Most importantly, the isolates
in Hong Kong were not resistant to vancomycin. They were strains with
resistant subpopulations (h-VRSA), but by standard NCCLS [National
Committee on Clinical Laboratory Standards criteria these strains would
have been classified as susceptible. h-VRSA have been described fairly
widely around the world, but the clinical significance is currently unclear.
No isolates of _S. aureus_ with vancomycin MIC >4mg/l (VISA/VRSA)
have been isolated in Hong Kong. [see comment at end for definition of MIC.
The Hospital Authority of Hong Kong, which runs all the public hospitals in
Hong Kong including those where these strains were isolated, issued a press
release on 4 Nov 1999 to clarify the situation.

[ProMED-mail frequently posts news reports for which some of the
information is unverified. As in this case useful discussion and
clarification often ensues. We rely on subscribers to help to place
initial news reports in proper perspective.
h-VRSA presumably refers to heterogeneous resistance among isolates, which
is observed in vitro as the presence of bacteria exhibiting higher minimal
inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for vancomycin with a frequency of 10(-4)
to 10(-5). It is reported to be easy to select for predominance of strains
with higher MICs in vitro, but such experiments do not necessarily predict
clinical outcome for patients treated with vancomycin. The following
references are suggested for those with additional interest. - Mod.ES
