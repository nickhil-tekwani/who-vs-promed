[Since April 2019, outbreaks of African swine fever (ASF) outside of the ASF controlled area have been reported in the Free State, North West, Eastern Cape, Gauteng and Mpumalanga provinces.

South Africa continues to have 2 active events. The status of each of these events is as follows:

- Event 1 started on 15 Apr 2019; 33 outbreaks have been reported. The event is still continuing. See event summary and updated map at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=30214.

- Event 2 started on 22 Apr 2020; 7 outbreaks have been reported. The event is still continuing. See event summary and updated map at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=34259.

These 40 outbreaks are located outside of South Africa's ASF control zone.

"In South Africa, there are defined ASF controlled areas in Limpopo, Mpumalanga, North West and KwaZulu Natal provinces where the disease occurs in wild pigs all the time (see map). Movement restrictions for all wild and domestic pigs and their products apply to, from and within these areas to prevent the disease from spreading to the unaffected areas of the country."
