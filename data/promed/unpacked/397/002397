CJD (new var.), tissue survey - UK 980828233344

From: J Ralph Blanchfield <jralphb@easynet.co.uk>

Both the need and the means to carry out such a survey were stated by John
Collinge's group [Hill et al (1997) "Diagnosis of new variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease by tonsil biopsy", The Lancet, 349, 9045, 11
January long before the case of Tony Barrett came to light.
The following extract from their paper is relevant, and reveals (final
quoted paragraph) that the answer to MHJ's question would appear to be
'Yes'.
"Recently, we reported that nvCJD is associated with a specific pattern of
protease-resistant prion protein (PrP) on Western blot analysis. This
marker can already be used to aid differential diagnosis on brain biopsy
samples. However, since PrP is widely expressed outside the central nervous
system, we investigated whether an alternative and more accessible tissue
might be biopsied to allow a diagnosis of nvCJD before death and to avoid
brain biopsy. PrP is expressed in the lymphoreticular system and prion
replication is known to occur in the spleen and other lymphoreticular
tissues in experimental rodent scrapie models; prion infectivity has also
been reported in human lymphoreticular tissues.
"We have studied PrP in tonsillar tissue obtained at necropsy using both
immunohistochemistry on periodate-lysine-paraformaldehyde and
formalin-fixed tissue, and Western blot analysis of frozen tissue. The
patient was a 35-year-old woman who died after a 14-month illness with
depression at onset followed by ataxia, hyper-reflexia, memory loss and
dementia; a diagnosis of nvCJD was made by neuropathology. Abnormal PrP
staining was present within tonsillar germinal centres. Western blot
analysis revealed the presence of protease resistant PrP ; confirming the
diagnosis of prion disease. Furthermore, the sizes and intensity ratios of
the three PrP bands (representing diglycosylated, monoglycosylated, and
unglycosylated PrP) were similar to those seen in brain from the same
patient (designated a type 4 pattern) suggesting that it may be possible to
make the specific diagnosis of nvCJD by this technique. However, tonsillar
tissues from types 1-3 CJD were not available for comparison. Such study of
protease-resistant PrP in lymphoreticular tissue may be particularly
relevant in iatrogenic CJD after peripheral prion inoculation (for instance
after treatment with human cadaveric pituitary-derived growth hormone where
lymphoreticular involvement would be expected.
"In experimental murine and sheep scrapie, prion replication occurs
initially in spleen and is only detectable in the central nervous system
considerably later in the incubation period. Abnormal PrP immunostaining
has been reported in tonsils of experimental scrapie-infected sheep long
before the occurrence of clinical signs. It is possible therefore that
Western blot analysis of human tonsil material may allow early clinical, or
possibly pre-clinical, diagnosis of CJD and nvCJD although extensive
prospective studies of suspected cases will be necessary to assess the
clinical usefulness of this investigation. Tonsil tissue can be easily
obtained by biopsy under local anaesthetic in most patients and
complications are most unusual. Although many adults will have had
childhood tonsillectomy, lymphoreticular tissue may still be obtained from
the lingual tonsillar remnants. As a result of the extreme resistance of
prions to normal sterilisation procedures, current UK recommendations are
that neurosurgical instruments from patients with CJD are destroyed. While
infective titres of prions in tonsil may be much lower than in brain,
similar precautions to avoid cross contamination and iatrogenic
transmission of CJD would seem prudent at present. The development of a
disposable tonsil-biopsy kit should be feasible. "

Your question, "can one remove tonsils twice?," can be answered with a
"yes." My pharyngeal tonsils (a.k.a. adenoids) grew back and were removed a
second time. I was a young child, so this is evidence that tonsillar
material may regrow.

[Nice to see one's rhetorical question answered, twice. From Hal's comment,
they clearly grow back quickly. Not something that the average veterinarian
would have much experience with. Thanks. - Mod.MHJ
