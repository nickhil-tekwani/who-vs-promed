Survey of Potential Impacts of Pesticides for Mosquito Control
--------------------------------------------------------------
The New York City Health Department announced on Fri 22 Dec 2000 that it
has published a "final scoping" document outlining plans to determine the
potential impact from the use of pesticides to control mosquitoes carrying
West Nile virus or other mosquito-borne diseases. The document, which has
been posted on the Health Department's Web site
<http://www.ci.nyc.ny.us/html/doh/pdf/wnv/finals.pdf>, will be used to
develop a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS). It outlines proposed
actions, potential environmental issues of concern, and proposed analysis
methods to address the potential environmental impacts of mosquito control
activities. New York City Health Commissioner Neal L. Cohen, M.D., said,
"For the past 2 summers, the City has taken State and Federal approved
actions to limit the spread of West Nile virus by using EPA approved
pesticides for mosquito control. The City is currently undertaking a
comprehensive review of the potential environmental impact of these
pesticides. This review involves public comment as well as a scientific
review and analysis of available information. While this effort has not
been done in other parts of the country where spraying for mosquito control
is done routinely, the City seeks to systematically assess the potential
impact of pesticides on public health and natural resources. As part of
this review process, alternatives to pesticide use will be explored as will
measures that could mitigate the adverse impacts of pesticide applications.
While we are committed to reducing the possibility of illnesses associated
with West Nile virus, our goal is to address public concerns about the use
of pesticides used for mosquito control and to minimize the risk of adverse
reactions to pesticides," Dr. Cohen concluded.
It is expected that a DEIS will be completed by March 2001. A public
response period and hearings in each borough will then take place. A Final
Environmental Impact Statement is expected to be published in June 2001.
The EIS is an integral component of the Health Department's plans to
implement a comprehensive surveillance and control plan for West Nile virus
in 2001. The "final scoping document" published on Fri 22 Dec 2000,
includes comments from public hearings held this summer.
