The Municipal Health Service in Amsterdam, The Netherlands (GGD Amsterdam) in
collaboration with the Public Health Laboratory Haarlem (Streeklaboratorium)
has identified beyond doubt that the cooling tower of the former Post Office
building in the east-central part of Amsterdam has been the source of the
recent epidemic in Amsterdam. Culture showed 5 000 000 colony-forming units/L.
AFLP (Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism) patterns of patients are
identical to those of the samples from the cooling tower. Samples from other
possible sources showed negative or had different AFLP patterns.
Since previous postings, 4 new patients have been identified, bringing the
total to 27 patients, of whom 6 were non-Amsterdam residents. The latter were
all employed in the vicinity of the cooling tower, most of them at the
building site adjacent to it. There are no reports of patients that were only
incidentally visiting the area, nor tourists or other visitors from abroad.
The 1st day of illness of patients varies from 27 Jun to 9 Jul 2006,
peaking on 1 Jul 2006. The age of cases varies between 32 and 81
years. One patient has died; another is on artificial ventilation,
and still another is in intensive care. Other patients are recovering.
As the cooling tower has [only] been out of operation since 11 Jul 2006, we
might still expect occasional new cases. Please inform us about legionellosis
patients in your country if they have visited Amsterdam in their incubation
period, from 8 Jun to 11 Jul 2006. Information on possible cases can be sent
to <lci@rivm.nl>.

[Once again, ProMED thanks the contributors for this firsthand report, with
confirmation of the source of the cluster. No cases in foreign travelers to
Amsterdam have as yet turned up, but please heed their call for reports of any
such. - Mod.LL/JW]
