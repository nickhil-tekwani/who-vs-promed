Dengue fever cases increased 72 percent in Costa Rica
---------------------------------------------------
Dengue fever cases increased 72 percent in Costa Rica during the
first 5 months of 2005 compared to 2004, and this has worried health
authorities.

5220 cases of dengue fever had been reported up to 11 Jun 2005,
compared to 3031 cases for the same time period in 2004, according to
the Ministry of Health.

"These figures are alarming", said Dr. Francisco Cubillo,
Vice-Minister for Health. He recalled that the rainy season is yet to
come, and this is the time when there is active reproduction of the
_Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, reported the newspaper La Nacion.

Dengue causes fever, chills, sweat, cough, and diarrhea, as well as
respiratory distress. There is a hemorrhagic form of dengue fever,
which occurs when a patient is infected for a 2nd time, and it may
even lead to death.

Dengue kills 30 in southern Yemen; nearly 1500 infected
---------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of the mosquito-borne dengue fever has killed at least 30
people in southern Yemen over the past 4 weeks, a health ministry
official said on Thursday.

"We have received reports of 30 deaths and 1487 infected cases," the
official told DPA on condition of anonymity.

The official said infections were reported in the southern provinces
of Shabwa, Aden, Abyan, Dalaa, Hadhramout and Houdieda [also spelled
Hodeida].

He said the worst infected area was the Red Sea province of Houdieda,
about 230 kilometres southwest of the capital Sanaa, where the
disease has so far infected nearly 400 people, of whom 15 died.

Dengue fever cases in city drop
-------------------------------------------
Cases of dengue fever in Iloilo City dropped to only 13 in the 1st
half of 2005, from 80 cases during the same period in 2004. "These
are reported and confirmed by hospitals in the city," City Health
Officer Urminico Baronda said of the 13 cases.

The reported cases are distributed, based on the City Health Office
statistics, [as follows:] City Proper and Arevalo have 4 cases each;
Molo 2; and Mandurriao, La Paz, and Jaro, one each.

Though the cases decreased this year, it is no reason to be
complacent, Baronda said. "Dengue cases have lessened this year but
we should not be relaxed. Mosquitoes that bring dengue fever
recognize no one," he warned.

Baronda advised Ilonggos to always keep their surroundings clean to
avoid the deadly mosquitoes.

He also suggested coordination between barangay officials and
residents in the campaign against dengue fever.

Over 8000 dengue fever cases reported in southern Vietnam
---------------------------------------------------
Vietnam's southern Mekong Delta has, so far in 2005, detected 8300
dengue fever cases, including 10 fatalities, according to Ho Chi Minh
City-based Pasteur Institute Thursday.

Most of the sufferers are from southern localities such as the
provinces of Soc Trang, An Giang, Dong Thap and Tien Giang, whose
weather is most favorable for the development of mosquitoes.

Local health workers are encouraging residents to kill mosquitoes and
their larvae more actively. More chemicals used to kill the insects
are being given to the residents.

Vietnam reported 73 300 cases of dengue fever infections, including
101 fatalities last year [2004], up 108 percent and 74 percent
against the previous year, respectively. [a case fatality rate (CFR)
at 138 per 100 000. - Mod.RY]

Anti-dengue measures intensified as number of dengue cases go up in June
---------------------------------------------------
The number of dengue cases has gone up in June 2005 due to warmer weather.

On average, there were about 300 cases per week, more than double the
weekly average in the last 3 months. March, April and May saw a
weekly average of 136 cases.

To curb the rise, especially as the warm weather is expected to
continue, the National Environment Agency (NEA) has extended its
campaigns to MRT stations and trains.

About 900 posters have been up since the beginning of June to educate
commuters about the dangers of the Aedes mosquitoes. About 50 SMRT
trains will be carrying the message till the middle of August.

NEA has said that for the first 3 weeks of June, there were about 610
cases, compared to 611 for the whole of May. In 2004, the number of
cases in June was 617 cases, compared to 470 the previous month.

According to the NEA, the number of dengue cases from the start of
2005 to the 3rd week of June stands at nearly 5000, more than double
the same period of 2004.

The warmer weather in June, July and August traditionally brings
about a spike in the number of dengue cases. That's because the
female _Aedes_ mosquito, which carries the virus, breeds faster in
such weather, and the infective period is also shorter. To tackle
this, NEA has intensified its awareness and outreach efforts.

"On the train there are 2 million commuters commuting every day, so
the train is a very good medium for us to spread the dengue
prevention message," said Dalson Chung of the Environment Health
Department of the NEA.

On the ground, NEA has also increased its search and destroy efforts
to reduce the _Aedes_ mosquito population.

In the 1st 5 months of 2005, it carried out more than 170 000
inspections of premises for breeding grounds, including parks and
vacant lands. It is also working with town councils to flush out
breeding grounds on roof tops and pump rooms.

Mosquito breeding in homes also went up and more owners were fined,
from 68 in February 2005 when fines were introduced, to more than 230
in May.

From January up to 14 May, there were 3552 cases of dengue fever and
94 cases of dengue haemorrhagic fever. So far only one death has been
reported.

NEA said that although more households may be aware of dengue, it
hopes that this awareness will translate into action to curb mosquito
breeding grounds.
