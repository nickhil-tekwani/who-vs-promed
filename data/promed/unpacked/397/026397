Malaria outbreak reported in Kyrgyzstan
---------------------------------------
Excerpt from report by the KyrgzInfo news agency website:
A total of 18 people diagnosed with malaria have been taken to the national
hospital for infectious diseases. 21 people were ill with this disease in
2004, and nearly the same number of people were infected in the first 6
months of 2005.
Officials from the state public health monitoring department said that all
measures were being taken to localize a [source] of the infection. The
medics suggest that one should not go to the Ala-Archa water reservoir
[near Bishkek].

[According to the centralized information system for infectious diseases
(CISID, <cisid@euro.who.int>) of the WHO Regional Office for Europe,
Kyrgyzstan reported no malaria cases in 1999, 7 in 2000, 15 in 2001, 2712
in 2002 and 465 in 2003. No WHO statistics for 2004 are available, but
compared to the numbers in 2002 and 2003, the numbers are still low if the
reporting is correct. We assume that all cases are autochthonous and
predominantly of _Plasmodium vivax_. - Mod.EP]
