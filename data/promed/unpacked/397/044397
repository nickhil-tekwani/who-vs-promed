One of the replies to ProMED-mail was critical of vaccinating any raccoons,
and I felt I should respond to his criticisms. First, the rehabilitator in
North Carolina is not raising the raccoons as pets, but as a wildlife
rehabilitator she is trying to treat and release injured or orphaned
wildlife. To spend considerable time and money rehabilitating a raccoon or
other wild animal and releasing it with the potential that the animal could
die from an infectious disease is shortsighted in the rehabilitator's eyes.
Vaccination with a reasonable chance of protecting the animal is the
preferred and ethical thing to do, if we have no reason to believe that by
vaccinating the animal we do not increase the risk of disease for the
remaining wildlife population.
I agree that raccoons should not be kept as pets, but in a well run
rehabilitator's clinic, this shouldn't be a problem. The value of wildlife
rehabilitation is primarily as a public education tool, and I feel that it
is a worth while goal. I also see little difference between treating a
wild animal with an unapproved vaccine as I do with using an unapproved
antibiotic or other veterinary drugs. The use of drugs on unapproved
species, when done
under the order and supervision of a veterinarian, is a necessary part of
any veterinarian's practice.
The last point I wish to make is based on the AVMA policy of discouraging
vaccination of nonapproved species. My view of their policy is based
primarily on the public health implications that having a "vaccinated"
animal implies. With bite or other potential rabies exposures, we need a
definitive knowledge base as to recommend post exposure rabies vaccination.
Since little work has been done with raccoons as compared to dogs, it is
safest to recommend that the animal be euthanized and tested for rabies.
For companion animals the vaccination provides reasonable assurance of
prevention of rabies, and the more conservative recommendation for the
animal is a 10 day observation period. If you have a companion animal such
as raccoon or a wolf hybrid, the lack of research on these species
necessitates a "euthanize and test" procedure which is difficult for the
owner to accept, especially if the animal has been vaccinated. Since all
these raccoons are to be released and do not have an owner, they will be
under the same stringent procedures as any other wild raccoon will be under
for rabies, and I do not see any extended level of risk for vaccinating and
releasing these animals.
