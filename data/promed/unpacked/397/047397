In 2013, coffee producers in Chiapas faced the worst coffee rust outbreak in history. Total crop losses are still unknown.

The Mexican Coffee Growers Association (AMECAFE) states that about 25 000 hectares [about 61 800 acres] have been affected in the Soconusco region, and producers in Yajalon, and the Altos and Sierra areas report over 100 000 hectares [about 247 105 acres] of affected coffee plantations there. Until now, coffee rust was unknown in the higher altitude areas of Mexico.

Chiapas's economic outlook for 2014 is uncertain.

[Coffee leaf rust (CLR; also called orange rust) is caused by the fungus _Hemileia vastatrix_, one of the most feared pathogens of the crop. Of the 2 coffee species grown commercially, _Coffea arabica_ (arabica or highland coffee) and _C. canephora_ (robusta or lowland coffee), it affects only arabica varieties, which are usually preferred for their taste. The rust has completely destroyed coffee industries in several countries. The disease is characterised by yellow-orange powdery lesions on the underside of leaves, where it attacks through stomata, but it rarely occurs on stems or fruit. CLR can lead to complete defoliation with death of the host plant.

Fungal spores are spread by wind, rain, and mechanical means. Disease management relies mainly on multiple fungicide applications during the rainy season. Rust-resistant cultivars exist, but the crop is generally of poorer quality. More than 30 races of the fungus have been detected, making it particularly difficult to establish durable host resistance.

The emergence in Central America of a new fungal strain adapted to higher altitude conditions, which may also show additional fungicide resistances, is making CLR control in the region considerably more difficult. In Guatemala, nearly 40 percent of the nation's coffee plantings are affected by the new strain and an emergency has been declared (see ProMED-mail post 20130203.1527736). Chiapas is directly adjacent to the border with Guatemala, and it is therefore not surprising that the new CLR strain has spread there. The current outbreak in Central America is regarded as one of the most severe attacks of the fungus on record.

A new more aggressive leaf rust strain is also suspected to be emerging in Colombia (see ProMED-mail posts 20100526.1745, 20091008.3490, and 20090225.0773). Information on the strain(s) involved in an outbreak in Jamaica is still needed.
