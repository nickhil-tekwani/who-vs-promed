The Massachusetts Department of Public Health [DPH] on Tuesday [18 Sep 2012] announced the additional case of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus [infections] in a Massachusetts resident. The new case brings the total known cases in Massachusetts to 5 for EEE virus [infections]. Last summer [2011], Massachusetts tallied 2 cases of EEE.

The case involved a man in his 70s from Essex County who was hospitalized for an EEE, [virus infection].

DPH also confirmed another case of EEE [virus infection] in a horse, stabled in Plympton (see ProMED-mail archive 20120917.1297815, below).

The virus is transmitted by mosquitoes. There is no [human] vaccine for EEE virus [although there is one available for equine animals]. Officials recommend limiting exposure to mosquitoes by using insect repellent, wearing long-sleeve shirts and long pants, and limiting time outside from dusk to dawn when mosquitoes are most active.

All of Massachusetts is under a moderate threat level for the virus, although several communities, including many in the Pioneer Valley, have elevated threat levels of high or critical.

Officials say people are urged to take precautions until the 1st frost of the fall kills off the mosquitoes.

[EEE virus infections are relatively uncommon but can be serious, leading to death or neurological damage in survivors. One hopes that the public in Massachusetts and Vermont will heed the advice of public health authorities and take positive measures to avoid mosquito bites.

A 49 year old man of Sudbury died this morning [18 Sep 2012] from [an infection by] the mosquito-borne eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus, announced Health Commissioner Harry Chen earlier this evening.

He was the 2nd person to die from EEE [virus infection] this month [September 2012] and the 2nd Vermonter ever to die from the virus. Earlier this month, an 87 year old man of Brandon died from the virus. The 2 men also contracted the 1st 2 documented cases of EEE [virus infection] in humans in Vermont.

This incident comes almost 2 full weeks after the Vermont Agency of Agriculture and Department of Health sprayed the synthetic pesticide Anvil over large swathes of land in the Rutland and Addison county towns of Brandon, Whiting, Salisbury, Leicester, Shoreham, and Cornwall.

According to Agency of Agriculture Deputy Secretary Jolinda Laclair, this spraying was the 1st time the state ever took to the air for the purpose of reducing mosquito populations with insecticides. Agency officials said last week [week of 10 Sep 2012] that tests show the spraying killed 60-69 per cent of the mosquitos in the targeted regions.

On Friday [14 Sep 2012], the Agency of Agriculture also reported the 1st case ever recorded of EEE [virus infection] in a horse, which lives in Whiting [see ProMED-mail archive no 20120917.1297815].

"I want to remind Vermonters that this is a very rare virus," wrote Chen in an email to reporters earlier this evening [18 Sep 2012]. "On average there are only 6 cases nationwide each year. It can lead to life-threatening illness for about a third of all people infected. So while exposure is extremely rare, it is a very serious illness."

The commissioner ended his letter with sympathies for the affected families.

[The ProMED-mail post of 1 Sep 2012 (archive no 20120904.1280189) reported these cases, but they were still alive at that time. Unfortunately, both have subsequently died of their infections.
