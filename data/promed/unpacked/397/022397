Fear of Spread of Ebola Fever as Kenyan children die
----------------------------------------------------
NAIROBI - Fears of the deadly Ebola fever gripped Kenya on Monday as 2
children died of a mystery disease and several others were admitted to
hospital. The villagers of Wasio, on the Lake Victoria shores and on the
Tanzanian border, panicked because the pupils had shown signs similar to
Ebola hemorrhagic fever.
The disease is reported to have killed 37 people in northern Uganda at the
weekend.
