Horses with a rare nerve condition have similar signs of disease as people with conditions such as Alzheimer's, a study has found.

The findings shed new light on the causes of the rare but predominately fatal horse condition and could help to develop new tools for diagnosing the illness.

Scientists say that horses affected by the disease -- called equine grass sickness -- could also hold clues to human conditions.

Grass sickness attacks nerve cells in horses but the causes of the disease are unknown. It causes gastric upset and muscle tremor and can kill within days. If diagnosed quickly, animals can sometimes be nursed back to health.

Researchers from the University of Edinburgh's Roslin Institute and Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies looked at nerve tissue from 6 horses that had died from equine grass sickness in a bid to investigate the causes of the condition.

They found that the horse tissue contained proteins that are commonly seen in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease -- such as the build-up of amyloid protein.

In total, 506 different proteins were found to be altered in nerve tissue from horses with grass sickness, compared with animals that had died from other causes.

This knowledge could help to develop tests for detecting the condition in horses, which can be tricky to diagnose.

Around 2 per cent of horses die from grass sickness each year in the UK.

The disease occurs almost exclusively in grass-fed animals, including ponies and donkeys. A similar condition is thought to affect cats, dogs, hares, rabbits, llamas, and possibly sheep.

The study is published in the journal Molecular and Cellular Proteomics. It was funded by The Equine Grass Sickness Fund.

The Roslin Institute receives strategic funding from the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council.

"Summary
--------
Equine grass sickness (EGS) is an acute, predominantly fatal, multiple system neuropathy of grazing horses with reported incidence rates of approximately 2 percent. An apparently identical disease occurs in multiple species including but not limited to cats, dogs, and rabbits.

Although the precise aetiology remains unclear, ultrastructural findings have suggested that the primary lesion lies in the glycoprotein biosynthetic pathway of specific neuronal populations. The goal of this study was therefore to identify the molecular processes underpinning neurodegeneration in EGS. Here we use a bottom up approach beginning with the application of modern proteomic tools to the analysis of cranial (superior) cervical ganglion (CCG -- a consistently affected tissue) from EGS affected patients and appropriate control cases postmortem. In what appears to be the 1st proteomic application of modern proteomic tools to equine neuronal tissues and/or to an inherent neurodegenerative disease of large animals (not a model of human disease), we identified 2311 proteins in CCG extracts, with 320 proteins increased and 186 decreased by greater than 20 percent relative to controls.

Further examination of selected proteomic candidates by quantitative fluorescent western blotting (QFWB) and sub-cellular expression profiling by immunohistochemistry, highlighted a previously unreported dysregulation in proteins commonly associated with protein misfolding/aggregation responses seen in a myriad of human neurodegenerative conditions, including but not limited to amyloid precursor protein (APP), microtubule associated protein (Tau) and multiple components of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS).

Differentially expressed proteins eligible for in silico pathway analysis clustered predominantly into the following biofunctions:
1. Diseases and disorders including neurological disease, skeletal, and muscular disorders;
2. Molecular and cellular functions: including cellular assembly and organisation, cell-to-cell signalling and interaction (including epinephrine, dopamine, and adrenergic signalling and receptor function) and small molecule biochemistry.

Interestingly, whilst the biofunctions identified in this study may represent pathways underpinning EGS induced neurodegeneration, this is also the 1st demonstration of potential molecular conservation (including previously unreported dysregulation of the UPS and APP) spanning the degenerative cascades from an apparently unrelated condition of large animals, to small animal models with altered neuronal vulnerability, and human neurological conditions.

Importantly, this study highlights the feasibility and benefits of applying modern proteomic techniques to veterinary investigations of neurodegenerative processes in diseases of large animals."

Horses suffering from equine dysautonomia (equine grass sickness -- EGS) show clinical symptoms indicating widespread autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction. Acute, subacute, and chronic forms of EGS are known to occur. The condition has been reported also from other European and South American countries ("mal seco"). It was reported (see ProMED-mail post 20030509.1154) to be characterised by seasonal occurrence with maximal incidence recorded late April through June; occurrence almost exclusively in pastured horses; higher incidence of the disease in younger (3-5-year-old) animals; greater risk of the disease on previously affected premises; increased risk for animals moved recently onto new pasture; occurrence usually preceded by cool, dry weather; apparent protective effect in individuals with previous contact with the disease; risk of disease somewhat less in female animals; and occurrence not linked directly to specific feeding practices.
