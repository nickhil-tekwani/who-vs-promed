Medical personnel in the city of Aralsk in the Kzyl-Orda region, where
there has been a focus of plague infection, have decided to release the
Aralsk infectious diseases hospital from quarantine.
According to earlier reports, a 4 year old girl from the village of Shomish
died from plague in Aralsk district hospital, infected after a flea bite
[see: Plague, bubonic - Kazakhstan (Kzyl-Orda) 20030822.2119]. The
diagnosis was proven microbiologically.
No other symptoms of the disease have been found in local residents.
Disinfection and measures against rats and insects have been taken. 7000
square metres of land were treated by required means. Anti-infection
measures have also been taken in a neighboring district, and 6000
households have been inspected.
Observation of 7 people contacts of the girl who died from plague is
continuing, though no symptoms of disease have yet been detected.
