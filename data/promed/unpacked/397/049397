Fusarium wilt arrives in NT
---------------------------
Watermelon growers in the Northern Territory (NT) are battling a
disease that can kill their crops. The Territory had been the only
part of Australia without fusarium wilt, but it has recently been
found near Katherine and Darwin.

Plant health manager Steven West says while the disease can be managed
by changing plant varieties, it's something that growers will have to
learn to adapt to.

"Once you've got the disease, it lives in the soil and carries over
from crop to crop to crop," he said. "So you can never be free of the
disease once your property has become infected."

[Fusarium wilt (FW) on watermelon (_Citrullus lanatus_) is caused by
the fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_ f. sp. _niveum_ and can cause serious
crop losses. Symptoms include discolouration of vascular bundles and
wilting of the plant. Plants may be affected at any growth stage:
young seedlings are killed or severely stunted, while older plants
wilt at midday for a few days, then permanently wilt and die. Disease
development is favoured by high soil temperatures.

The fungus can persist in the soil for many years. Spread occurs
mainly with soil, infected crop debris, irrigation water, and human
activities (for example on contaminated farm machinery). Disease
management requires an integrated approach including crop rotation and
phytosanitary measures to avoid spread to new fields. The usefulness
of resistant cultivars, if available, may also depend on fungal
populations in the soil. Flooding of fields has been reported to
reduce pathogen survival in the soil.

Different strains of the fungus affect other cucurbit crops, for
example _F. o._ f. sp. _cucumerinum_ affects cucumber (_Cucumis
sativus_), and f. sp. _melonis_ affects rockmelon and muskmelon (both
_Cucumis melo_). Each pathogen is highly specialised attacking only a
single crop species.
