SLAUGHTER OF 35,000 TURKEYS ORDERED
Apr. 4/98
The Irish Times
Sean MacConnell
It was announced yesterday that the slaughter of 35,000 turkeys at a
Monaghan poultry farm has been ordered by the Department of Agriculture and
Food. The Department had been monitoring an outbreak of avian flu on 15
farms in Smithborough and at adjoining farms in Co Cavan. While tests from
the UK laboratory at Weybridge show the flu strain is not harmful to humans,
the birds on one farm have developed _Pasteurella_ disease. This respiratory
system ailment causes the birds distress, and the Department has ordered
that the creatures be destroyed.
Last night the Department stressed there was no link between the Monaghan
flu and a strain which killed six people in Hong Kong and led to the
destruction of hundreds of thousands of poultry. A spokesman for the
department was quoted as saying, "What we have found from the initial
investigation is that the birds are suffering from a strain of avian flu
which is common in wild birds and is frequently passed on to farmed birds.
There is no question of a link to the Hong Kong flu virus which has not been
found outside that area. We are taking every precaution to avoid the spread
of the disease and to protect human health and the health status of the
other farms in the area."

The avian influenza isolates from Ireland are of the H7N7 subtype. They do
not have multiple basic amino acids at the haemagglutinin cleavage site that
would be indicative of a highly pathogenic virus and the intravenous
pathogenicity index is 0. The Monaghan isolate is still being sequenced but
I don't expect it to be different from the others [from Ireland that the CVL
has examined.
