The confirmation of the [hantavirus infection] case in Las Golondrinas [Chubut province] was issued by Dr Jorge Elias on air to Radio 3 and he remarked the "this is the 1st case of the year [2019] not related to the outbreak in Epuyen, which is absolutely closed."

The infected person is a craftsman who was in contact with the natural environment of the endemic disease [virus]. "The man has a history of having been camping in a wild environment and, in fact lives, in a semi-wild place that is the natural niche of the hantavirus [reservoir rodent]."

The Associate Director of the Esquel programmatic area said that the 47-year-old patient "is clinically stable, hospitalized in the Bariloche hospital and it is timely to clarify that this is the 1st case that was addressed with all the protocols that have been implemented since the outbreak of [hantavirus infections] in Epuyen."

Before consulting about the characteristics of the [virus] strain he said, "we cannot know if it is exactly the same as the [virus of] the previous one (from Epuyen) until the Malbran institute has carried out the procedures that take a few months to identify the genome of this virus, but without a doubt the approach [now] has a different protocol." He clarified that both the patient's wife and daughter who are in El Bolson are already in selective isolation," and 3 months ago that was unthinkable; now the approach is totally different."

Given his symptomatology, the patient went to the hospital of El Bolson and the authorities of this hospital ordered his transfer to the Bariloche hospital because it is more complex and recently incorporated equipment.

Finally, the health director made the recommendations about the case "we always said that hantavirus is endemic and we should always be careful when doing a risky activity in a wild environment that is the natural niche for the 'colilargo' [long-tailed] mouse that carries the hantavirus. When we camp in a wild environment it necessary to take precautionary measures; that is the way to avoid infection with this disease [virus]," he concluded.

[The hantavirus involved in the case above is not mentioned, but very likely is Andes virus, as was confirmed in the Epuyen outbreak earlier this year (2019). The Andes virus (ANDV, genus _Orthohantavirus_, family Hantaviridae) was confirmed as the etiological agent in the Epuyen outbreak. Its most common host reservoir is the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_).

Transmission from rodent to human usually occurs through close contact with infected urine and excretions. Secondary human-to-human infections are considered rare but may occur through direct contact with infected saliva, urine, or blood. However, in the situation above, because of the human-to-human transmission in the Epuyen outbreak, the patient's wife and daughter have been placed in isolation until proven free of infection, or treated if infected. - Mod.TY
