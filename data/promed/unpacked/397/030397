Livestock producers should be cautious of anthrax this year
-----------------------------------------------------------
The naturally occurring illness can cause staggering, convulsions,
and rapid death in animals. Unfortunately, the wet weather this year
is increasing the risk of disease. A University of Saskatchewan
veterinary professor is reminding livestock producers to protect their
herds against anthrax.

Flooded land could be a problem for more than just raising crops, it
could also mean a deadly season for livestock producers. Dr Chris
Clark of the Western College of Veterinary Medicine says that the
first predictor for the potential of anthrax is a wet spring. Despite
a few isolated cases since, the last outbreak occurred in the summer
of 2006. And so to avoid the necessary widespread destruction of
animals, Dr Clark says cattle, horses, bison, and other grazing
animals should be vaccinated.

"I think the producers in areas where there has been anthrax in the
past, if they've been vaccinating in the past, this is a year to make
sure you vaccinate and be ultra-cautious of it," says Clark. Clark
says the soggy conditions have created ideal conditions for anthrax
spores to surface. "The bacterial spores live deep in the soil, and
they'll float. So, if you flood, you wash them out of the deep soil
and bring them to the surface." Clark explains the floating spores are
not a high risk because they are spread out on the water. However, he
says the threat becomes greater when the flooded land starts to dry
up. The large puddles recede to become small puddles with lush grass
around them -- concentrating the spores and creating a disease risk.
"So, at the moment, if it dries up rapidly, this could be a year for
anthrax," says Clark.

According to the Canadian Veterinary Journal, during the 2006
outbreak the Canadian Food Inspection Agency recorded a total of 804
livestock deaths from anthrax.

Anthrax vaccination reminder
----------------------------
State veterinarian Dr Dustin Oedekoven reminds livestock producers to
remain diligent in vaccinating their livestock against anthrax.
Flooding in various parts of the state has created conditions that are
favorable for Anthrax. Anthrax spores may lie dormant in soil for
years, only to surface after flooding. The most effective way to
manage the disease is through annual preventive vaccination, as
unvaccinated animals tend to die suddenly after exposure, with no
opportunity for treatment. Your local veterinarian is a valuable
source of information regarding vaccination protocols.

Anthrax vaccination reminder
----------------------------
Producers in north western Minnesota are urged to vaccinate their
cattle soon against naturally-occurring anthrax.

"Before producers turn their cattle out on pasture this summer they
should consider vaccinating for anthrax," said Minnesota Board of
Animal Health executive director and state veterinarian Dr Bill
Hartmann. "Cattle that graze can be exposed to anthrax spores in the
soil. Vaccination is an inexpensive way to protect your cattle."

Anthrax is a naturally occurring disease caused by the bacteria
_Bacillus anthracis_. The bacteria can lie dormant for years in the
soil. However, heavy rains and flooding can bring the spores to the
surface, where they may be ingested by grazing animals. Livestock
infected with anthrax die quickly, often exhibiting no symptoms until
just before death.

As an added precaution, Hartmann recommends producers assume that any
unexpected death among their herd is due to anthrax until the disease
can be ruled out. Suspect carcasses should not be cut open, because
that can allow anthrax to spread. If you suspect anthrax contact your
veterinarian immediately.
