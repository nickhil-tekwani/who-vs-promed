Salmonella outbreak linked to onions
------------------------------------

Fast facts
----------
Illnesses: 652 (60 new)
Hospitalizations: 129 (13 new)
Deaths: 0
States: 37 (1 new)
Recall: no
Investigation status: active

CDC, FDA, and public health and regulatory officials in several states are collecting different types of data to investigate a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella_ Oranienburg infections linked to onions.

Epidemiologic and traceback data show that illnesses in this outbreak are linked to whole red, white, and yellow onions distributed by ProSource Inc. that were imported from Chihuahua, Mexico. Investigators are working to determine if other onions or suppliers are linked to this outbreak.

Epidemiologic data
-----------------
As of 18 Oct 2021, 652 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ Oranienburg have been reported from 37 states (see map at https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/oranienburg-09-21/map.html). Illnesses started on dates ranging from 31 May 2021 to 30 Sep 2021 (see timeline at https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/oranienburg-09-21/epi.html).

Sick people range in age from less than 1 year to 97 years, with a median age of 37, and 57% are female. Of 417 people with information available, 129 (31%) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

The true number of sick people in an outbreak is likely much higher than the number reported, and the outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses. This is because many people recover without medical care and are not tested for _Salmonella_. In addition, recent illnesses may not yet be reported as it usually takes 3-4 weeks to determine if a sick person is part of an outbreak.

In interviews, ill people answered questions about the foods they ate and other exposures in the week before they became ill. Of 193 people with information, 145 (75%) reported eating or maybe eating raw onions or dishes likely containing raw onion before they became sick. Several ill people reported eating at the same restaurants, indicating they may be part of illness clusters. These clusters can provide clues about what food item may be making people sick. If several unrelated ill people ate or shopped at the same location of a restaurant or store within several days of each other, it suggests that the contaminated food item was served or sold there. States identified 20 illness clusters at restaurants where onions were served. Information from these clusters shows that many ill people ate raw onions.

Laboratory and traceback data
----------------------------
FDA conducted a traceback investigation and identified ProSource Inc. as a common supplier of imported onions to many of the restaurants where sick people ate. One of these clusters occurred in a restaurant where investigators identified the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ Oranienburg in a condiment container with leftover lime and cilantro. The sick person reported that the condiment cup had also contained onions, although none were left when the condiment was tested. FDA is working to determine if other suppliers of onions may be linked to this outbreak or if there is a common supplier of onions in Chihuahua, Mexico.

Whole-genome sequencing of bacteria in samples from 609 people did not predict any antibiotic resistance. Samples from 3 people were predicted to be resistant to one or more of the following antimicrobials: amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ampicillin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, gentamicin, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline. Standard antimicrobial susceptibility testing by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory is currently underway. Most people with _Salmonella_ illness recover without antibacterials. However, if antimicrobials are needed, this resistance is unlikely to affect the choice of therapy used to treat most people because it is rare.

Public health actions
--------------------
CDC and FDA recommend that you not eat, sell, or serve fresh whole red, white, or yellow onions distributed by ProSource Inc. that were imported from Chihuahua, Mexico.

What you should do
---------------------
- Do not buy or eat any whole fresh red, white, or yellow onions if they were imported from Chihuahua, Mexico, and distributed by ProSource Inc.
- Throw away any whole red, white, or yellow onions you have at home that do not have a sticker or packaging.
- These onions may have stickers or packaging indicating the brand (ProSource Inc.) and the country (Mexico) where they were grown. If you can't tell where the onions are from, don't buy or eat them.
- Wash surfaces and containers these onions may have touched using hot soapy water or a dishwasher.
