In 2019, Sweden is experiencing its largest outbreak of tularemia in over 50 years. The outbreak started in July [2019], and as at 6 Oct 2019, a total of 979 cases have been reported. Here, we report the demographic features of cases and geographical distribution of the outbreak. We also provide evidence that the predominant route of transmission is via mosquito bites and want to make visitors aware of risks in endemic areas.

Identification of the outbreak
-----------------------
In the last week of July 2019, the county medical officer (CMO) of Gavleborg county, central Sweden, received information from healthcare providers about an increasing number of people visiting healthcare centers with fever and presenting swollen inguinal and axillary lymph nodes. By 31 Jul 2019, there were 18 reported cases of tularemia; all were residents of or visitors to a small town in the county, Ljusdal. According to healthcare providers in Ljusdal, a majority had spent time near a lake and a golf course adjacent to the town. As a major golf competition with visitors from all over Sweden had been held between 23 and 27 Jul 2019, the CMO issued a press release on 31 Jul 2019 announcing the outbreak and put information on the Swedish national healthcare website (1177 Vardguiden) to alert healthcare in regions not used to diagnosing the disease. On 2 Aug 2019, the Swedish National Veterinary Institute (SVA) published a news item about a suspected outbreak of tularemia among hares (_Lepus_ species), as a large number of dead hares had been detected and that tularemia had been identified in hares from several locations around Sweden.

During the 1st week of August 2019, an unusually large number of human tularemia cases were reported to the Public Health Agency of Sweden (PHAS) from other locations, mainly in neighboring counties to Gavleborg in central Sweden. On 12 Aug 2019, the PHAS published a news item on its website about the outbreak. At that time, the number of reported tularemia cases had reached over 80 in the county of Dalarna, where a major cycling competition with more than 20 000 national and international participants was taking place between 10 and 16 Aug 2019. A case definition for tularemia was as follows:

Tularemia case definition, Sweden
---------------------------
For a confirmed case, at least one of the following 3:
- Isolation of _Francisella tularensis_;
- Detection of _Francisella tularensis_ nucleic acid; or
- _Francisella tularensis_-specific antibody response

For a probable case, both of the following 2:
- Clinical picture compatible with tularemia; and
- Epidemiological link

Descriptive epidemiology
-----------------
As at week 40 2019 (6 Oct 2019), a total of 979 tularemia cases were reported to PHAS, 98% of which were registered since 24 Jul 2019, over 4 times more than the average number for the corresponding periods between 2000 and 2018 (Figure 1 [For figures and tables, see original URL. - Mod.LL]). Of the reported cases, 734 were laboratory confirmed mainly based on serology (n = 404) or PCR (n = 285).

Between 1 Jan and 6 Oct each year during the period 2000-2018, 4422 tularemia cases were reported, of which 2557 (58%) were male and 1865 (42%) were female, with median ages of 50 years for both sexes. A significantly larger proportion of females above the age of 50 years were infected with tularemia in 2019 compared with the period between 2000 and 2018 (chi-squared test: p less than 0.001). For 752 of 979 tularemia cases in 2019, a specific municipality could be designated as the probable place of infection based on the information given in clinical reports. Fifteen municipalities reported 10 or more cases, and 13 were located in central Sweden. In 2 municipalities, over 100 cases were reported (Figure 3).

Dalarna county was the most affected by the tularemia outbreak and, according to reports from healthcare centers, 268 of 326 cases (82%) had the ulceroglandular form of tularemia; information was missing for 58 cases. A similar dominance of ulceroglandular tularemia has also been reported from local healthcare centres in Gavleborg county with patients having inflamed and sometimes infected mosquito bites. There have also been 4 reports of pneumonic cases. Of 979 tularemia cases reported nationally until 6 Oct 2019, 719 (73%) had a cause of infection specified as insect bites, which is higher than the corresponding period 2000-2018 (2729/4422 cases; 62%).

Environmental investigation and findings in wildlife
---------------------------------------------------
Mosquitoes were collected around the golf course in Ljusdal on 15 and 16 Aug 2019. A total of 550 mosquitoes were trapped, and of those, 373 (68%) belonged to the known tularemia vector _Aedes cinereus_ (Table 1). All other species found, except _Culiseta morsitans_, have previously been shown to be implicated in tularemia transmission [1]. Mosquitoes were divided into species pools based on their trapping location; in total, there were 24 pools. Molecular analyses showed that one of 8 pools of _Aedes cinereus_ containing 103 specimens that were collected near the tee to hole 14 and known to be a particularly mosquito-infested area among golfers tested positive for _Francisella tularensis holarctica_.

In Sweden, dead hares are routinely collected and analyzed by the SVA [2]. In 2019, 54 dead hares with tularemia were collected, while the mean annual number of dead hares with tularemia between 2007 and 2018 was 9 (Figure 4).

Discussion and conclusion
------------------------
Tularemia is caused by the highly contagious bacterium _Francisella tularensis_, which can infect humans as well as more than 250 animal species [3]. Tularemia is widely spread throughout the northern hemisphere, and cases have been reported from all European countries except Iceland, Ireland, and the United Kingdom [4]. From some parts of Sweden and Finland, where tularemia occurs endemically, the highest incidence in Europe is reported [5].

Sweden has reported cases of endemic tularemia since 1931 [6]. There has always been a variation in the number of human cases between different years, ranging from 0 cases in 1990 to 2700 cases in 1967. During the 2000s, the number of reported cases varied from 26 in 2001 to 859 in 2015, with a resulting incidence of 0.29 and 8.72 cases per 100 000 inhabitants, respectively. However, no cyclical patterns or general trends were observed (personal communication Pontus Jureen, PHAS, 30 Sep 2019). The number of reported tularemia cases thus far in 2019 is higher than what has been reported in any single year since the end of the 1960s, and it is more than is reported from the whole of Europe during a normal year [4].

Historically, more males were reported with tularemia infection than females, with the age group 40-69 years most affected for both sexes; this pattern is seen in outbreak years as well years with a low number of reported infections (data not shown). This may be a reflection of the age distribution of people in rural areas working outdoors, e.g., doing farm and garden work [7]. In the current outbreak, a larger proportion of women aged 50 years and older has been observed, but the reasons for this deviating pattern is unknown. It is possible, for example, that with 2019 being a good mushroom year, more women in this age group were attracted to tularemia-risk areas to pick mushrooms.

Ever since the 1st tularemia cases were reported in 1931 until the early 1990s, the endemic area was in the northern part of central Sweden and extended along the Gulf of Bothnia [8]. Since the end of the 1990s, the geographical distribution of cases has expanded with a spread both to the west and towards the southern parts of central Sweden [9]. This expanded area has since remained endemic for tularemia and experienced larger outbreaks in its northern part in 2012 and 2015, in its central part in 2010, and in its southern part in 2000 and 2003. An expansion of the endemic area further south is not unlikely in the future, supported by the numerous dead hares with tularemia detected up to September 2019 by SVA, where at least 8 had been found in Gotaland located south of the endemic area [10].

Tularemia can be transmitted to humans through arthropod vectors, direct contact with infected animals, or by inhalation of contaminated dust. Due to the mode of transmission, different clinical forms are distinguished. In neighboring Norway and elsewhere in Europe, ingestion of contaminated water from streams, ponds, lakes, and rivers is the main mode of infection [4,11]. In Sweden, however, most cases are infected by mosquito bites, but transmission by ticks and rain flies also occurs [12]. Typically, mosquito-transmitted ulceroglandular tularemia starts to become evident late July or August, reaching a peak at the end of August or in September before declining up to December. Large mosquito populations are a risk factor for outbreaks of tularemia [13]. In this outbreak, the time of onset of symptoms in cases, e.g., reports of ulceroglandular tularemia plus inflamed or infected mosquito bites, suggests that the predominant mode of transmission was via mosquitoes. This is supported by the detection of _Francisella tularensis_ in the mosquito species _Aedes cinereus_ near the golf course in Ljusdal. The weather conditions in 2019, with a relatively wet spring and a mild summer and autumn, may have resulted in a favorable year for mosquito populations, meaning that transmission of tularemia between mosquitoes and their host animals may have been longer and more favorable than normal. However, it was not possible to investigate this further, as mosquito densities in high-risk areas are not monitored, nor are the populations of potential animal hosts. Interestingly, however, the outbreaks of tularemia in central Sweden in 2003 and 2010 and in northern Sweden in 2012 and 2015 were all preceded by wetter springs than normal in the high-risk areas.

As at 14 Oct 2019, the number of new cases of tularemia has dropped drastically, returning to average seasonal levels for the previous 3 weeks. However, due to the unusually high number of cases concentrated to areas with large numbers of external visitors, the 2019 tularemia outbreak has prompted intense communication between local and central authorities and attracted a great deal of media attention in Sweden. With this rapid communication, we aim to raise awareness for the risk of contracting tularemia through mosquito bites in endemic areas in Sweden and to raise awareness regarding protective measures such as wearing covering clothing and use of insect repellent. We also aim to raise awareness of tularemia among healthcare providers in non-endemic areas, as they may encounter patients who have acquired tularemia infection visiting high-risk areas such as in central and northern Sweden.
