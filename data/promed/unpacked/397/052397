Diphyllobothriasis ex-Brazil in a Dutch traveller
-------------------------------------------------
A 31 year old man from The Netherlands with a history of recent travel to
Brazil (Nov 2004) found a 15 cm long tapelike whitish object in his feces
that he referred to as "tagliatella" [a type of long, flat pasta]. Apart
from this he had no complaints. The patient had recently visited the Sao
Paulo region and had eaten raw oysters and raw fish dishes. He had not
recently visited any endemic regions in Europe or other parts of the world.
Parasitological evaluation of his feces showed an abundance of
Diphyllobothrium eggs. The patient was treated with praziquantel 10 mg/kg
and reported having seen numerous proglottids in the days following
treatment. Unfortunately these weren't brought to the lab for further
determination of species. No eggs were found when his feces were
re-evaluated 2 weeks later.
Later that week we learned of the Diphyllobothriasis outbreak in the Sao
Paulo region of Brazil. This shows that Diphyllobothriasis is easily
exported and that physicians should be aware of diphyllobathriasis in
patients with a recent travel history to Brazil.

[We cannot be absolutely sure that the patient was indeed infected in
Brazil. There is some discussion whether _D. latum_ occurs at all in South
America or whether humans are infected with _Diphyllobothrium pacificum_ .
Perhaps molecular typing could solve this question. - Mod.EP]
