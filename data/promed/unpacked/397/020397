As a Macon man recovers from a rabid dog attack, Warren County Animal Control is urging area pet owners to get their animals vaccinated.

[The 56-year-old man], was attacked by 3 dogs on [1 Jul 2015]. He had finished walking his puppy and left the dog on the screened front porch, only to hear a commotion outside a few minutes later and find 3 dogs had come on to the porch. "I opened the door and hollered, 'Get out of here.' The one that was right there, he just latched onto my leg," [the man] said [Fri 10 Jul 2015]. "I grabbed him by his face and hit him, and he yelped and ran off the porch."

A 2nd dog, which was attacking the puppy, then put up much more of a fight, however. "He jumped on me, jumped for my face," he said. "When he did that, I ducked, and he grabbed me on top of my head. I threw the dog the half-length of the porch. I thought he would run off, but he didn't. He just kept coming. "Every time I let loose of him, he kept biting me. I said I can't keep staying right here. I've got to kill the dog," he continued. His wife tossed a knife to him, and he stabbed the dog to death. Officials said it later tested positive for rabies.

Warren County Animal Control Director Elma Rae Green said the other 2 dogs, which got away, most likely were rabid as well but have probably died of the virus by now. "We don't have that many rabid dogs being tested in North Carolina," Green said. "We usually see under a dozen dogs that are rabid. They are usually coming in contact with rabid wildlife."

Warren County had its 6th rabies case of the year on [Thu 9 Jul 2015]. 2 dogs killed a rabid skunk, and both dogs had to be euthanized because they weren't up to date on their rabies vaccines and the county couldn't find a place to quarantine them for 6 months.

Green said her concern now is to protect the community, so her department is urging all Warren County pet owners to get their animals vaccinated against rabies and other diseases. "We have a strong rabies control program here. We held a low-cost rabies clinic at the local fire department and had several people come to that," she said.

[The man] who is undergoing a series of rabies shots and had to receive 40 stitches to close bite wounds, echoed Green's call for vaccinating pets. "You got to do it. There's no ifs, ands, or buts about it," he said. "You don't want a child to get attacked by one of these dogs or any dog that has rabies."

[The man's] puppy wasn't hurt in the [1 Jul 2015] attack. It was quarantined briefly and is now doing fine.

[Our thanks to Kathryn for sending us this report. Presumably, the attacked "puppy" had been vaccinated prior to being attacked, otherwise it would have been quarantined for an extended period.

The state North Carolina of can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=3517862,47027. Warren County, in northern North Carolina, can be seen on the map at http://geology.com/county-map/north-carolina-county-map.gif.

Gentlemen, apropos the knife-tossing NC wife, I received the following story from Dr Smith: "Years ago we had a woman out walking her dog [on lead] one morning before work, a fox ran out of the woods and attacked the dog. She grabbed the fox and choked it to death -- then called the PD/us (Animal Rabies Control). You'd have to know this lady to know how absurd this really was -- small stature, kind of 'prissy', management position at our local airport -- never in a million years would anyone think she could have choked ANYTHING to death!! but she does love her dogs!" So, treat all North Carolina ladies with respect. - Mod.MHJ]
