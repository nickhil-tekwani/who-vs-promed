Jackson County [Michigan] health care providers saw an unusually high number of influenza cases in December [2014], Jackson County's health officer said. Richard Thoune, the health officer for both Allegiance Health and Jackson County, said influenza-like illnesses in Jackson County appear to be 3 times higher this year [2014] than the average number of December cases in the last 5 years. Not only are more influenza-like illnesses being treated, they appear to be more serious, Thoune said. "Jackson County is significantly higher than it has been in the last 3 or 4 years. ... December for us has been a really active month," Thoune said. "We've also seen higher than normal hospitalizations for influenza."

In December 2014 there were at least 1020 influenza-like illnesses treated in Jackson County, according to data from the Michigan Department of Community Health's [MDCH] Michigan Disease Surveillance System. The average number of December cases from 2009 through 2013 was 315. Those at the highest risk for serious illnesses related to influenza are people with weak immune systems including young children, people with chronic illnesses, and the elderly, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

For influenza hospitalizations, MDCH's Michigan Disease Surveillance System reports an average of less than 2 cases in December from 2009 through 2013, but at least 17 hospitalizations were reported in December this year [2014]. Thoune said what is different about the flu outbreak this December is the H3N2 strain, a strain of the flu not covered by the influenza vaccine. "That particular strain did shift and change on us. ... But there are 2 or 3 strains that the vaccine should provide good coverage for," Thoune said."(Vaccines) are still our best tool for fighting influenza and we encourage people to get the shot. It's not too late."

While the flu season this year [2014] began in December "with a vengeance", Thoune said there have been worse outbreaks of influenza in the county. MDCH's Michigan Disease Surveillance System reported 4922 cases in October 2009, the highest number of influenza-like illnesses treated in Jackson County in the past 6 years. Thoune said it is hard to predict whether or not this flu season yet peaked, but said there is potential for a high amount of cases through about April. To prevent further spread of the virus he urges Jackson County residents to get the flu shot and to monitor their health. "We would continue to emphasize that people need to take care of their community, family and themselves," Thoune said.

[According to the most recent WHO global update, seasonal influenza activity has continued to increase in the northern hemisphere with influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominating so far (http://www.who.int/influenza/surveillance_monitoring/updates/latest_update_GIP_surveillance/en/). The antigenic characterization of the most recent A(H3N2) viruses so far indicated differences from the A(H3N2) virus used in the influenza vaccines for the northern hemisphere 2014-2015, and likely enhanced severity of the 2014/15 seasonal outbreak. The report from Michigan may be the 1st confirmation of this prediction. - Mod.CP
