The Agency "Southern region", referring to Vladimir Ryzhkov, chief of
a department of epidemiological supervision in the management of
Rospotrebnadzor [Territorial Directorate of the Federal Services for
Consumer Protection and Human Welfare] in the Rostov region, noted
that since the beginning of the year [2007] 6 cases of WN fever have
been registered in the Rostov region. The latest case of the disease
was recorded last week [27 Aug - 2 Sep 2007] in Rostov.
Ryzhkov reported that mosquitoes infected by WN virus have been
detected by experts of Rospotrebnadzor in the Proletarsky,
Neklinovsky, Azovsky, Myasnikovsky, Salsky, & Kamensky districts. In
Rostov-on-Don they are distributed in the Kumzensky grove, in flooded
cellars of the houses, and sewage collectors. Ryzhkov has also stated
that mosquitoes infected by WN virus from wild birds, can be found in
the open in other districts of the region. As he said, in connection
with the distribution of vectors of WN virus in the region, it will
be necessary to carry out large-scale treatment of territories by
[insecticidal] chemicals. At the same time, he noted that [pesticide]
application near reservoirs could cause mass fish die offs.

[For the last 20 days the number of persons who have fallen ill with
WN [virus] in the Rostov area has increased 2-fold, connected to the
distribution in the region of the mosquitoes containing the virus. In
the regions of the Southern Federal district of Russia, cases of WN
fever have been registered since 1999. This disease occurs in the
Rostov, Astrakhan, Volgograd Krasnodar, and Stavropol regions.
In 2005, 15 persons contracted WN virus in the Rostov region, 13 in
2006 -- so 6 ill persons [in 2007] is not the maximum for this
region. The most significant outbreak of WN fever was registered in
the Southern federal district in 2005, in the Astrakhan area, when 73
persons fell ill. - Mod.NP]
[This report does not state from which mosquito species WN virus has
been isolated. In a previous study, WN virus was isolated from _Culex
pipiens pipiens_ & _Culex modestus Ficalbi_ collected in the
Volgograd region (see reference below). If adult WN virus-infected
female _Cx._ spp. are being collected in cellars now, it is possible
that the mosquitoes are seeking places to spend the winter. If so,
this could constitute the virus overwintering mechanism, and may
explain the apparent endemicity of the virus in this region.
