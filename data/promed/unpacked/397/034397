Thank you for that excellent and informative discussion of _Clostridium_
infection in grazing animals as it might relate to the reported cases of
human disease in South Africa.
Does anyone actually know of any human cases (natural or otherwise) of
epsilon toxin intoxication? About 2 years ago, I did an extensive search
and tried to find any published reports, including discussions with
colleagues such as Ken Alibek (former Soviet biowarfare program), and
Charles Bailey and Bill Patrick (former US biowarfare program), and none
knew of any unpublished tests or actual published reports.
I had always assumed that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
had some information not available to the rest of us that justified the
inclusion of epsilon toxin in their list of category B weapons, but no one
I spoke with at the CDC seemed to have any knowledge of this information. I
am aware of some non-human primate _in vitro_ cell culture studies that
suggest cellular pathogenicity, but, without any actual information on
human intoxication, how can we be certain of anything?

[_Clostridium spp._ and any of the 12 different protein toxins produced by
them can affect any species. Clostridium has been listed as a potential
bioterrorism weapon, because the toxin can be easily manufactured and can
be aerosolized easily, causing serious acute pulmonary disease. In
addition, it can cause hemolysis, vascular leaking, thrombocytopenia and
liver damage, tissue hypoxia and shock, any of which may be incapacitating
or fatal. The toxin could also be put into water and food. - Mod.TG
Indeed, the possible effects of epsilon toxin in humans are, based on
published data available to me, suppositions. What may be known by some is
unpublished and is not available to us. In vitrovery few human cell lines
are susceptible to the effects of epsilon toxin. - Mod.LL]
