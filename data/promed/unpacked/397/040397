The State Secretariat for Public Health (Sesap) posted a dengue
report yesterday [19 Jun 2008] in the weekly newsletter monitoring
dengue in Rio Grande do Norte [RN]. According to the figures, dengue
was recorded in 167 state municipalities, totaling 30 471 cases up to
the moment. The incidence of disease is considered highest in 54
counties, which includes more than 1000 cases per 100 000
inhabitants. In the other 57 [municipalities], the highest incidence
is 300 cases per 100 000 inhabitants.

According to the state dengue consultant, Lucia de Fatima Araujo,
"when evaluating the cases week to week, one sees that since the 15th
[epidemiological] week in April 2008, the number is falling due to
actions that were taken and by the history of the epidemic." Lucia
explained that training has been held in the State in order to
structure the teams for the 2nd half of the year and continue
controlling the disease in RN.

In the Grande Natal region, a total of 14 200 cases were reported,
with 613 DHF [cases], of which 69 were [laboratory] confirmed. The
number of people who have died in the region with symptoms of dengue
has reached 21, with one confirmation by laboratory tests. In the
state capital, dengue [cases] reached 9602 people, including 485
cases of DHF (63 confirmed). There were 13 reported deaths, with one
confirmed as of the present.

In Mossoro, the number of reported cases remains unchanged since last
week and is 1342 since the beginning of the year [2008], with 9
suspected [cases] of DHF, and one laboratory confirmed case.

press from the southeast, the dengue epidemic in Brazil still has not
ended. There are more things needed to define an epidemic than simply
the absolute number of cases. - Mod.LJS]

Around 5000 cases of dengue fever have hit southern provinces. The
number is expected to rise in Tien Giang, Ca Mau and Bac Lieu, among others.

The incidence of dengue so far this year [2008] has doubled to 1000
cases over the same period last year [2007], according to Ca Mau
Province's Preventative Health Centre. The epidemic is set to
increase in the remaining weeks of June 2008, according to Hoang Hai
Dang, the centre's deputy head.

Tran Van Thoi, Nam Can and Tran Van Thoi General Hospitals in Ca Mau
Province were operating past full capacity due to a surge of new
patients. Tien Giang Province was also hit hard, with more than 1000
cases in Go Cong Dong, Cai Lay and Cho Gao Districts and My Tho City.

A lack of pesticides and concrete methods for preventing the disease
for locals is to blame for the disease's spread, according to health
officials in the delta.

[Local residents can prevent dengue virus transmission by eliminating
_Aedes aegypti_ breeding sites in and around their houses and other
buildings. This requires effective public education.

Dengue fever claimed 7 lives in the southernmost province of Saravane
last year [2007], according to Provincial Public Health Division on
[12 Jun 2008]. More than 200 people in Kongsedon, Lakonpheng,
Saravan, Laungam and Vapi districts, Saravane province, were reported
to be infected with dengue fever.

Kongsedone is a district that has been seriously hit, where almost
180 people were reported to [be infected] with dengue fever. The
provincial health official warned district public health services,
the local authorities and local people to smash mosquito breeding
sources and to sleep under impregnated mosquito nets.

Last week, the Thateng Public Health Service, Sekong province,
reported that 73 people were infected with dengue fever: There were
31 cases in Lamam district and 42 cases in Thateng district.

Deputy Head of Health Office in Thateng district, Mr. Korlakanh
Boutsaba, said the dengue fever started early this year [2008] and
seemed to increase every month, especially in May 2008, when the
total infected increased by 11 cases.

At present, the authorities of Thateng district, in cooperation with
Provincial Malaria Parasites and Insects Station, are operating a
campaign to impregnate mosquito nets in 57 villages and urged local
people in Chunla, Paleng, Thateng Tai-Nuea, Houaysai and Kongtayoun
villages to get rid of the habitat of mosquito larvae.

The district authorities also collaborated with the provincial public
health division to spray a killing mosquito liquid in the district
and called for other village authorities to monitor the outbreak of
dengue fever that might be spread.

Last year [2007], more than 100 people in Thateng district were
infected with dengue fever. Luckily, no one died.
