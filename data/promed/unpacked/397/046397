Coffee rust reaches new heights in Central America
--------------------------------------------------
Coffee rust first hit Central America in the 1970s. For decades, coffee growers simply coped with the blight and lower yields. But as rust spread to the highlands, the problem demanded action.

Last year [2013], Guatemala declared a national emergency [ProMED-mail post 20130203.1527736], with officials estimating rust had affected 70 percent of the nation's crop. Producers in the Guatemalan highlands have lost, on average, between a 30 and 60 percent of their income. The UN is providing emergency food aid to 14 000 households that have lost income due to rust.

In neighboring El Salvador, the rate of infection is 74 percent, according to the London-based International Coffee Organization. In Costa Rica, it's 64 percent; in Nicaragua, 37 percent; and in Honduras, 25 percent.

Rust also has hit farms in Southern Mexico [ProMED-mail post 20140128.2236486], which produces much of the region's shade-grown coffee, and where the government is leading a sweeping replanting project and intends to replace about 20 percent of coffee plants each year.

The spread of rust has prompted growers to adopt new measures, such as "stumping," the practice of pruning trees of all infected vegetation in hopes of encouraging them to regrow with greater vibrancy. They are also using fungicides and installing shade covers, which appear to help keep the fungus at bay.

[Coffee leaf rust (CLR; also called orange rust) is caused by the fungus _Hemileia vastatrix_, one of the most feared pathogens of the crop. Of the 2 coffee species grown commercially, _Coffea arabica_ (arabica or highland coffee) and _C. canephora_ (robusta or lowland coffee), it affects only arabica varieties, which are usually preferred for their taste. The rust has completely destroyed coffee industries in several countries. The disease is characterised by yellow-orange powdery lesions on the underside of leaves, where it attacks through stomata, but it rarely occurs on stems or fruit. CLR can lead to complete defoliation with death of the host plant.

Fungal spores are spread by wind, rain, and mechanical means. Disease management relies mainly on multiple fungicide applications during the rainy season. Rust-resistant cultivars exist, but the crop is generally of poorer quality. More than 30 races of the fungus have been detected, making it particularly difficult to establish durable host resistance.

The emergence in Central America of a new fungal strain adapted to higher altitude conditions, which may also show additional fungicide resistances, is making CLR control in the region considerably more difficult. The new strain has also recently been identified in Mexico (ProMED-mail post 20140128.2236486) The current outbreak in the region is regarded as one of the most severe attacks of the fungus on record worldwide.

A new more aggressive leaf rust strain is also suspected to be emerging in Colombia (see ProMED-mail posts 20100526.1745, 20091008.3490, and 20090225.0773). Information on the strain(s) involved in an outbreak in Jamaica is still needed.
