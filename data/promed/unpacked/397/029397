MONTEVIDEO - Uruguay's Agriculture Ministry said Tuesday signs of
foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) may have been detected among a small group
of cattle in its northern pastures.
"It may be FMD because clinically, according to our technicians, it is. But
we are awaiting laboratory analyses to confirm it," the Uruguayan
ministry's Animal Health director Hipolito Tapie said. Tapie did not say if
the fresh traces of the disease constituted full-blown outbreaks or if only
antibodies for the virus were found.
The latest FMD scare flared up in the city of Artigas, about 375 miles (600
km) north of the capital Montevideo and near the border with Brazil. Tapie
said the laboratory results should be ready later on in the day.
Agriculture Minister Gonzalo Gonzalez said that the 4473 square mile (11
928 sq km) Artigas department is already being closed off to the entry and
departure of livestock products. "Initially, Artigas department will be
closed and action will be taken in
surrounding areas. It needs to be made clear animals in nearby areas did
not show any kinds of signs," Gonzalez said.
Uruguay's 10-million-strong cattle herd has been declared free of FMD
disease without vaccination since 1995. The illness causes cloven-hoofed
animals to develop blisters and fever and is often fatal. The feared FMD
hot spot is dedicated principally to dairy farming, and to a lesser extent,
swine.
The revelation comes after a FMD scare swept through the southeastern
countries of South America in August, causing more than 14 000 animals to
be killed and cutting trade with key beef buyers, such as Canada and the
United States.
At that juncture, Uruguay was the only country in the Mercosur trade bloc
-- including Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay -- to be declared
totally free of the scourge and its antibodies.
Argentina was forced to suspend fresh beef exports to most of the
Americas in August after 10 Paraguayan cattle allegedly smuggled into the
country tested positive for antibodies for the virus while Brazil
suffered a full-blown outbreak.
Uruguay's beef, renowned for its ranch-fed quality, makes the small
coastal nation of 3.2 million people a world leader in the trade. Of the
average 250 000 tons of meat is exported annually, beef makes up the
majority, followed by offal and lamb.
