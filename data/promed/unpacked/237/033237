Farmers in Kagera Region are reporting the emergence of a never seen before disease that is attacking leguminous plants across the lake zone. Farmers lamented that their beans are drying up just when they start flowering, causing them to die before they can multiply.

"The cause of the disease is not yet known," a farmer reported. He called upon extension officers to visit their farms and advise them on how to deal with the diseases, cautioning that they now threaten food security in the region. "The new disease is giving us a hard time," he said.

Dr. Magdalena William, Maruku Agriculture Training Institute, said the unknown disease may have been caused by use of contaminated seeds. "Planting healthy seeds is an important aspect," she said.

[From this report, it is not possible to speculate on the diseases or disorders referred to. It is also unclear what type of "bean" is affected, since the term may be used for a number of different crops, including species of _Phaseolus_ (common, French, runner, Lima beans), _Vigna_ (mung beans), _Vicia_ (broad, faba or field bean) and _Glycine_ (soybean). The report also suggests that other legumes may be affected as well, which would include other vegetables like peas and lentils, and possibly even tropical forage legumes.

A range of fungal, bacterial, viral and nematode pathogens are known to occur in the region, several of which are shared amongst different genera of legumes. Some of these legume pathogens may be seed transmitted, as suggested in the report above. Reliable diagnosis would be paramount to providing solutions for the farmers.
