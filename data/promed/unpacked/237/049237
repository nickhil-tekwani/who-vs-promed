Health officials on alert after 3 malaria deaths in Jamshedpur district, Jharkhand
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Three casualties in the past 48 hours have put the district health department on alert with malaria officials trying to rein in the spread of viral brain malaria disease in the district.

"According to the available reports, two persons died of brain malaria in the Tata Motors http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tata-motors-ltd/stocks/companyid-12934.cms hospital and one in MGM College Hospital so far," said district surveillance officer Swaran Singh adding that adequate measures were being taken to check the spread of the disease.

Manisha, a college student, and her brother Ranjit, a school-goer, residents of Patel Nagar, Govindpur died of brain malaria in Tata Motors hospital while a 45-year-old man succumbed to the same disease in the
government-run hospital on Monday.

The Steel City, which experienced abnormal rise in vector-borne disease in 2011, caught unawares on Monday when three death cases of brain malaria came to the light.

The malaria officials on Tuesday said they were carrying out awareness campaign to explain the people about anti-malaria measures along with the cleaning exercise at malaria-prone sites.

"Polluted water is the favorite breeding ground for the cerebral malaria so we are paying more attention to this point immediately," said an officer in the malaria cell of the health department.

"The effective way of preventing oneself from falling victim to brain malaria is to keep ourselves and the surroundings clean," said casualty ward doctor at MGM Hospital Sandeep Singh.

The health department has appealed to the citizens to keep their air coolers clean regularly and ensure there is no garbage piled up in their surroundings and also to see that water does not get accumulated in
potholes, petty wells and drains. Suspected cases of brain malaria are coming to MGM Hospital since the incessant rain began last week, said hospital sources.

"Certain zones in the rural areas have been outside the cleaning sweep. Several places under Mango and Jugsalai notified areas (in urban periphery) continues to be prone to malaria diseases," said JMM district president Ramesh Hansda, who submitted a memorandum to the district administration on Tuesday, seeking special cleaning drive in the malaria prone zones.

Malaria on the raise in Jaipur, Rajasthan
----------------------------------------------------
Malaria cases have also been recorded in large numbers as in comparison of July 1-7 last year where only 44 positives, in the same period the number has crossed the 200 mark this year.

"In the rainy season, mosquitoes find breeding ground due to water logging and both dengue and chikungunya cases increase. Both the diseases are caused by Aedes mosquitoes," Director Public Health Dr BR Meena said. "Seeing the rainy season, we are conducting anti-larva activities and door-to-door surveys are being conducted.

The rapid response teams have been alerted in Jaipur and across the state. All the CMHOs have been instructed to undertake spraying of anti-mosquito medicines in their respective areas," she added.
