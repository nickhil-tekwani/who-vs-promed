[ProMED-mail is indebted to Steve H.S. Kuo, M.D., Ph. D., Director,
Taiwan Centers for Disease Control, for provision of this
clarification of the nationality and status of the suspected human
case of avian influenza in Viet Nam described in the ProMED-mail
posts:
Avian influenza, human (148): Viet Nam, susp. RFI 20071108.3625, and
Avian influenza, human (148): Viet Nam, susp., RFI, corr.,
20071110.3646 - Mod.CP]

This is a follow up to ProMed - Avian influenza, human (148): Viet
Nam, susp., RFI, corr.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------
The 32-year-old Taiwanese man, who died of suspected avian influenza
in Viet Nam on 5 Nov 2007, went to Viet Nam on 31 Oct 2007. According
to information received from the Ho Chi Min City Pasteur Institute,
the man was admitted to hospital on 2 Nov 2007, presenting with fever
of 38.5 degrees C [101.3 degrees F], cough, sore throat, and dyspnea.
Additional information from his wife indicated that he had abdominal
pain associated with severe uncontrollable watery diarrhea. The man
also had a history of chronic diarrhea and alcoholic hepatitis. No
additional information on the final diagnosis has been received.
However, avian influenza had been ruled out.

The father of the suspected case of avian influenza was admitted to
hospital in Taiwan on 6 Oct 2007. He was a 58-year-old man with long
history of smoking. In October, he was admitted because of increased
frequency of cough. Chest x-ray showed left upper lobe, posterior
segment consolidation that is suspicious of tuberculosis. After
treatment with antibiotics, the patient was discharged. He has been
well since discharge.

At this time, we do not believe that there is any epidemiological
association between the illnesses of the father and son.

[ProMED-mail welcomes this clarification which clearly establishes
that the 32-year-old patient in Viet Nam originated from Taiwan (not
Korea) and furthermore confirms that he has been eliminated as a
suspected human case of H5N1 avian influenza. The father of the
suspected Vietnamese case is resident in Taiwan and has recovered
from an unrelated respiratory illness. There is considered to be no
epidemiological link between the illnesses of the father and the son.
Neither are now suspected human cases of avian influenza and no
potential clustering of cases has occurred. - Mod.CP]
