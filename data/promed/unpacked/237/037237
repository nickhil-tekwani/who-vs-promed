[1] EFSA updated epidemiological analysis
Date: Fri 17 May 2013 [accessed]
Source: European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Technical report; supporting Publications 2013:EN-429 [22 pp.] - summary [edited]

Following the request from the European Commission for EFSA to continue to collect data and provide updates of the epidemiological situation on Schmallenberg virus (SBV) in the EU, data received during the reporting period was analysed, updating the previously published report on the analysis of the epidemiological data and preliminary assessment of impact.

The analysis intends to give an overview of the SBV situation (reporting period from 1 Aug 2011 till 30 Apr 2013) together with an update of newly affected herds.

Most countries in Europe have reported SBV cases. It can be seen that in winter 2012 and spring 2013, the area where cases were reported has expanded. In the north, the area in the United Kingdom has extended to Scotland, and in the Scandinavia mainland, regions of Norway, Finland and Sweden are now affected. SBV has also spread to new regions in the east of Europe: Estonia, Latvia, Hungary, Slovenia and Croatia.

Cattle, sheep, goats, alpacas, bison, buffalos, camels, horses, llamas, moose, fallow deer, roe deer and red deer have also been tested for SBV. SBV has been detected by RT-PCR in bison, deer and moose, plus alpacas, buffalos as well as cattle, sheep and goats; fallow deer roe deer and red deer have been found to be seropositive.

Acute cases in adult animals and arthrogryposis-hydranencephaly syndrome (AHS) cases in foetuses and neonates (not all confirmed by laboratory testing) are still being observed in 2013. Acute adult cases in Germany were observed in all months from November 2012 to April 2013 suggesting virus circulation during the winter period. AHS cases are being reported in newly affected areas. In some of the previously affected countries, the affected area is still expanding. Areas on the periphery of previously affected countries may have a lower prevalence, and therefore susceptible animals may be present. There is no apparent evidence to refute the assumption that SBV infection results in long term immunity, but vigilance for evidence to the contrary is important.

Temporal analysis of cases with laboratory confirmation by pathogen detection shows the outbreak evolution over time. Serological results were excluded since the serological detection of SBV antibodies can only be used as evidence of infection and provide no information on whether detected cases are in the clinical phase of the disease (i.e. new occurrence) or correspond to a previous infection. Since September 2011, there has been no period where new SBV cases have not been detected; any temporal variation is most probably due to production practices in the affected species.

In the previous report (EFSA November 2012), a between-herd-impact assessment based upon the comparison between SBV-confirmed herds and the total number of herds in each affected region by species was made. For all affected countries, the number of SBV-confirmed herds was estimated to be low compared with the total number of herds. Nevertheless, under-reporting or lack of confirmation was noted to affect the ratio. Considering the possibility of high under-ascertainment, the analysis previously done may not provide any additional information regarding between-herd impact of the infection.

[2] SBV and mutation accumulation
Date: Tue 14 May 2013
Source: Microbepost.org [edited]
http://microbepost.org/2013/05/14/schmallenberg-in-sheep-a-variable-virus/


In 2011, a new animal virus was detected in the German town of Schmallenberg. This virus, which infects sheep and cows, is now sweeping across Europe and was 1st identified in the UK in 2012. In a new paper published in the Journal of General Virology, researchers in Belgium have found an area of the virus's genome that is very prone to mutation.

Schmallenberg virus (SBV) belongs to the genus _Orthobunyavirus_, which contains several other viruses of veterinary importance. It causes a relatively mild or symptomless infection in adult cows or sheep but can cross the placental barrier and cause serious congenital malformations or stillbirths in calves and lambs. SBV is an Arbovirus transmitted between animals by biting insects. DEFRA suggest that the virus was bought to the UK by infected midges being blown across the Channel.

New research led by Dr Benoit Muylkens looked at the genetic variation of SBV after it infected the sheep flock at the University of Namur, Belgium. Dr Muylkens and colleagues compared the genomes of 2 SBV samples isolated from the nervous systems of 2 stillborn lambs to see how similar the viruses were. They found a high level of variability between the 2 samples, with the majority of differences found in a specific region of the SBV genome described by the authors as "hypervariable." This region, which represents around 10 percent of the viral genome, had over half of the genetic changes.

As Dr Muylkens told me, "It was amazing [me] to see how 2 viruses, isolated at the same time from the same outbreak in a single herd, were so different. The 2 infected ewes came from a subgroup in the herd; they lived very close together."

Curiously, each of the samples showed more similarity to the 1st sequenced SBV -- isolated in Germany the previous year -- than they did to each other.

SBV's variation can be explained by its genetic material, which is RNA, rather than DNA. Like a great many other RNA viruses, the protein machinery that SBV uses to copy its genome lacks any proofreading ability. If a mistake happens while the RNA is being replicated -- the wrong nucleotide being incorporated, for example -- the mistake is permanent, meaning that every generation is potentially different from the one that preceded it.

The hypervariable region where most of the changes occurred was found in a gene encoding a glycoprotein that spikes out from the surface of the virus. Glycoproteins help viruses attach to and enter host cells; having one that is constantly changing may have several benefits to SBV.

Surface glycoproteins are often targets for the immune system, so having one that constantly changes might help SBV evade the host's defences. Additionally, the changes might help the virus find new attachment sites on host cells.

In this work, the researchers grew several generations of SBV in vitro and showed that variability was found in the genome even in the absence of immune system pressure, suggesting that the changes in surface glycoprotein are not purely a method of immune system avoidance.

This work on SBV is important as it shows how the virus behaves in real life conditions. The researchers are now investigating the differences between the viruses in this study and those taken from the flock after a 2nd infection that occurred a year later. That SBV can re-infect a previously exposed population suggests that it has changed enough to avoid the immune system. This is bad news, particularly as no vaccine yet exists.

Dr Muylkens explains, "Europe is now probably infected in an endemic fashion. I think the situation will be different with SBV compared to bluetongue virus, which arrived in 2006. After a few years of vaccination, we could manage it; now it appears to be absent in Europe. I'm not sure we'll be so quick to manage SBV."

[3] OIE press release

The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) organised on 7-8 May 2013 an informal technical meeting on the risks related to trade in live bovines and small ruminants, their germplasm, and products from countries where Schmallenberg infection is present.

Participants in the meeting included OIE experts Prof Steven Edwards (Chair of the meeting and previous chair of the Biological Standards Commission), Dr Ann Brigitte Cay (Belgium), Dr Peter Kirkland (Australia), Dr Toshiyuki Tsutsui (Japan), and representatives from Belarus, the Federation of Russia and Kazakhstan. Dr Francisco Reviriego-Gordejo, from the Directorate General for Health and Consumers of the European Commission and Dr Kazimieras Lukauskas OIE Representative in Moscow, as well as several officers from OIE Headquarters attended as observers.

The meeting allowed the participants to share views on the potential risks of spread of the Schmallenberg virus [SBV] through international trade in relevant animals and animal products. The group especially discussed the Technical factsheet published by the OIE on its website after acceptance by the elected OIE Scientific Commission for Animal Diseases (SCAD).

The country representatives from Belarus, Russia and Kazakhstan also insisted on the current status of the criteria used by the OIE for inclusion of any animal disease on the OIE list of notifiable diseases (found in Chapter 1.1 of the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code), as well as on the status of the data available on the impact of the disease in susceptible species.

The inclusion of an animal disease to the OIE list follows a detailed procedure: a recommendation by the relevant OIE ad hoc Group, which is based on the use of a precise decision tree (found in Chapter 1.2 of the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code*) is submitted for the endorsement by the relevant elected specialist Commissions before it is presented for final adoption by the World Assembly of Delegates.

*[The chapter is accessible at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahc/2010/chapitre_1.1.2.pdf; in previous editions, a graphical presentation of the decision tree was included].

In May 2012, the OIE Member Countries adopted revised listing criteria in Chapter 1.2. of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code. The OIE ad hoc Group on Notification of Animal Diseases and Pathogenic Agents considered SBV (and other diseases) for listing against the new criteria in July 2012 and recommended, at that time, against listing SBV. This position was accepted by the Terrestrial Code Commission in September 2012, and the report of the ad hoc Group was forwarded to Member Countries as an annex of the Code Commission report.

However, OIE Member Countries must always notify SBV as an emerging disease to the OIE when it is 1st detected. Submission of follow up reports to the OIE after notification can be stopped when the disease becomes endemic within the Member Country's territory. In many countries, the spread of the disease can be linked to the natural movement of the infected _Culicoides_ vector.

To date 19 OIE Member Countries from the regional Commission of Europe have sent information to the OIE on Schmallenberg infection as an emerging disease, and these notifications have been published in the World Animal Health Information Database (WAHID) on the OIE website or will be confirmed during the OIE World Assembly.

The request by Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus to the OIE to consider Schmallenberg infection as an OIE-listed disease has been officially given to the OIE Director General. The Director General will transmit the request to the relevant bodies for a new examination, following again the official procedures.

After the meeting, some new national measures, including on semen and embryos, have been taken in accordance with a part of the current OIE guidelines.

[Since SBV has, at least as of yet, not been added to OIE's disease list, the need to prevent its spread by animals and genetic material has led to bilateral agreements between several exporting European countries and their ex-European trade partners on SBV-related veterinary testing requirements and certification.

Just to present examples reflecting a transparent policy, see the following model certificates available on UK's DEFRA web-site:

1. Export of bovine semen from the UK to Uruguay: Supplementary certification in respect of Schmallenberg virus (SBV): http://www.defra.gov.uk/animal-trade/files/ehc6170sup.pdf.

2. Export of bovine embryos from the UK to Uruguay: Supplementary certification in respect of Schmallenberg virus (SBV): http://www.defra.gov.uk/animal-trade/files/ehc7071sup.pdf.

Other European countries known to be infected by SBV have signed varied agreements with their respective trade partners in relation to genetic bovine material and live cattle. Obviously, standardisation of such requirements, based upon solid and generally agreed on scientific evidence, would be a welcome development. - Mod.AS]
