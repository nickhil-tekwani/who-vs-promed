[The 2 Dec 2010 edition of the Indian Express
(<http://www.indianexpress.com/story-print/719044/>) reports an
increase Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Assam, and some other states in the
north-east, with a shift in age-specific incidence and 70 percent of
cases being over 15 years and in UP between 25 and 40 years of age.

Regarding the situation in UP, Dr KP Kushwaha, Head of Pediatrics
Department at Gorakhpur's BRD Medical College, said: "It is true that
in our record, we have noticed this trend that the number of JE as
well as acute encephalitis syndrome cases among adults is increasing
since last year [2009]. About 700 AES cases have been reported among
adults this year -- of these around 100 were JE."

Kushwaha said some parts of the increase could be "because the total
number of AES cases has increased from about 2100 last year to about
3000 cases this year." But there is another disturbing trend: while
the mortality rate of the disease among children has been around 13.7
percent, the mortality rate among adults was close to 16 percent this
year, he said.

The 2 Dec 2010 edition of
(<http://in.jagran.yahoo.com/news/local/uttarpradesh/4_1_6972559.html>
in Hindi) mentions both Japanese and waterborne encephalitis are
involved in these outbreaks.

The 29 Nov 2010 edition of the Indian Express
(<http://www.indianexpress.com/news/JE-vaccination-to-begin-in-eastern-UP-at-last/717544>)
reports that after 6 months after the Centre and the state government
disagreed over the use of "unusable" Japanese encephalitis vaccine
for a special vaccination drive in the eastern Uttar Pradesh, the
drive would finally begin on 30 Nov 2010 with the state getting a
fresh stock of the vaccine.

The etiologies of the apparent majority these cases are still not
defined. Both JE virus and unnamed water-borne virus (enterovirus?)
are reportedly involved. There is no explanation offered in any
reports thus far of why the non-JE virus(es) have not been identified
after several months. Apparently, the campaign with fresh JE virus
vaccine was initiated several months after the outbreak began and JE
virus infection was diagnosed.
