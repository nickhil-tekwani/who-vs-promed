Some further background information on the post archived as "Measles
- UK (Scotland) 20070111.0131."
The increased incidence of measles in Scotland in 2006 just reflects
the situation in the UK as a whole, and measles incidence has
actually been lower in Scotland than in some other parts of the UK,
where MMR uptake has been historically lower. Almost all the cases
were unimmunised, but not all in age groups affected by declines in
MMR uptake post-1998; 7 of the cases were adults, 3 in the 10-14 year
age group and 8 aged 5-9 years. The remainder were aged less than 4 years.
