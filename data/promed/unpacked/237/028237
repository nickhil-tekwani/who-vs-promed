["Fowl typhoid in chickens and turkeys is caused by _S. Gallinarum biovar Gallinarum_ and is more often observed in the later growing period and in mature stock. Disease is often characterised by rapid spread with high morbidity and acute or subacute mortality. Red mites may be involved in the transmission of disease and persistence in poultry houses.

"Clinical signs in chicks and poults include anorexia, diarrhoea, dehydration, weakness and death. In mature birds Pullorum disease is less severe but decreased egg production, poor hatchability and some increased mortality may occur. Fowl typhoid is a more acute septicaemic condition which mainly affects mature birds and may be particularly severe in commercial laying flocks"

For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods, please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2015, Chapter 2.3.11 "Fowl typhoid and Pullorum disease" at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.03.11_FOWL_TYPHOID.pdf
(Version adopted by the World Assembly of Delegates of the OIE in May 2012).

"_Salmonella Gallinarum_ is highly host adapted, and it is not considered to be a serious public health concern. In one survey, only 8 out of more than 450 000 isolations of salmonella from humans were _Salmonella Gallinarum_". http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/fowl_typhoid.pdf

The XV Arica y Parinacota Region is one of Chile's 15 1st-order administrative divisions. It borders Peru to the north, Bolivia to the east and Chile's Tarapacá Region to the south. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arica_y_Parinacota_Region - Mod.CRD
