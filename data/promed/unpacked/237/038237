Health officials are trying to trace the source of an outbreak of illnesses
caused by _Cryptosporidium_ in Northern Ireland.
The Eastern Health Board has said the outbreak seems to be "almost
completely" confined to their area. They are looking for a common source of
85 recorded cases, mostly in the County Antrim and County Down towns of
Lisburn and Bangor.
Dr Philip Donaghy from the Eastern Health Board said that to most people
the [organism "causes a few days illness". However, in young children, the
elderly or the immunosuppressed, it can be extremely dangerous. Mr Donaghy
said: "It is a small organism which people swallow and in the gut it
affects the cells causing diarrhoea, abdominal pains, a feeling of illness
and sometimes vomiting."
'Hygiene and water precautions'
[_Cryptosporidium_ can often be waterborne, but the Water Service has said
intensive tests they have carried out have found nothing abnormal.
Mr Donaghy added that people throughout Northern Ireland should take
precautions. "It can be a mild to moderate illness." "It affects children
more than adults and in the last few weeks we have had a number of children
admitted to hospital for a few days, but all have been discharged without
untoward effects.
"It is rarely fatal, although people who already have immunocompromised
illness would need to be very careful, but there are already instructions
out that they should always boil water and cool it down and we would like
to again emphasise this.
