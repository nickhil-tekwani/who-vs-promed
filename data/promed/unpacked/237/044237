Nepal: 69 Japanese Encephalitis Deaths so far in 2003
-------------------------------------------------
69 people have died in Nepal this year from Japanese encephalitis, an
inflammation of the brain caused by [a virus transmitted by] mosquitoes,
the Health Ministry said. A total of 330 people have sought treatment for
encephalitis.
15 of Nepal's 75 districts are still at risk this season from the disease,
which is prevalent during the monsoon season, said an official at the
health ministry's disease control division. The most affected areas of
Nepal were in the Terai, the humid lowland area bordering India that
accounts for more than 40 percent of the kingdom's population.
In India, Health Minister Sushma Swaraj said that as of 4 Aug 2003 there
had been 639 cases of encephalitis in the country this year, including 275
deaths.

[Despite the availability of effective vaccines, Japanese encephalitis
continues to be a serious disease problem throughout many tropical areas of
Asia. The border region between Nepal and the Uttar Pradesh province of
India is particularly vulnerable, due to an abundance of mosquito-breeding
sites provided by agricultural irrigation. Japanese encephalitis virus is
maintained in a cycle involving culicine mosquitoes and water birds. The
virus is transmitted to humans by the culicine mosquitoes, which breed in
rice fields. Pigs can be amplifying hosts in suitable environments.
Mortality in most outbreaks is below 10 percent, but children are
particularly at risk and mortality in them may reach 30 percent. - Mod.CP]
