Five more persons, three of them children, died of dengue fever despite
fogging operations and a province wide [Oriental Mindoro campaign on
disease awareness. This brought to 16 the number of persons who have died
of the viral disease in Oriental Mindoro.
The three children died between July 1 and 10. Eighty-four confirmed
dengue cases were recorded from June 1 to 10 despite fogging operations in
over 2,529 houses and dialogues with affected communities in six
dengue-stricken towns.
A health authority said, "We would like to reiterate that fogging is not
the answer. What we need is massive cleaning of the surroundings to
eliminate the breeding grounds of the mosquitoes". Water-filled bottles,
plastic containers, jars, cans and even bao (coconut shells) were found
containing larvae of the dengue-carrying mosquitoes (_Aedes aegypti_ and
_Aedes albopictus_) when a team from the Department of Health visited
Barangay Marfrancisco in Pinamalayan.
The mosquitoes can infect people living within a 200-meter radius [unless
there is wind.
