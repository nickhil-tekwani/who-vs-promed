An 82-year-old man is hospitalized in critical condition in the intensive care unit at the Hospital of Infectious Diseases in Iasi, suspected of being infected with anthrax, He is being kept alive by machines, as reported by the AFP correspondent.

Dr Carmen Dorobat, Iasi hospital manager, told the media on Monday [22 Apr 2013] that the patient has a necrotic lesion on his upper lip and massive facial edema. These symptoms are specific to anthrax infection.

"There is suspicion of anthrax that will be confirmed after completion of investigations. We are waiting for test results," said Dr Dorobat.

"Besides the suspicion of anthrax the patient has a possible mixed infection with _Staphylococcus aureus_. He is in serious condition, being connected [presumably to a respirator. - Mod.MHJ]. He is under treatment covering both anthrax infection and a possible infection with _Staphylococcus aureus_," the doctor said.

Anthrax is an infectious and contagious disease in animals and in humans it is manifested by lung, gastrointestinal, and skin abscesses. In humans it is called "black boil, coal, or carbuncle".

[To find Iasi, in north eastern Romania, go to http://www.fallingrain.com/world/RO/23/Iasi.html.
It is less than 16 km [about 9 mi] from the Moldova border.

Anthrax is very sporadic in Romania and as a result many livestock cases, whether in cattle or sheep, are associated with human cases. Disease awareness is re-learnt the hard way. - Mod.MHJ]
