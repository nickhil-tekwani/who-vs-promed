Early stage _Trypanosoma rhodesiense_ HAT in a Belgian traveler visiting Masai Mara, Kenya
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A Belgian adult male traveler had stayed in Kenya from 30 Jan to 13 Feb 2012 to Kenya, and visited Masai Mara from 7 Feb until 9 Feb 2012. Details about the places visited in that game park will follow soon.

He had fever from 16 Feb 2012 onwards and a diagnosis of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) was made on a thick film in another Belgian hospital on 19 Feb 2012. The patient was transferred the next day to the inpatient ward for tropical diseases of the Institute of Tropical Medicine, University Hospital Antwerp, Belgium, for treatment.

He had a painless chancre on his left upper arm and had fever, malaise, and headache on admission.

The prepatent period lasted thus 7 to 9 days, and the hematogenic phase of the acute disease before diagnosis (and treatment) was 4 days. This short period precludes brain invasion, which may occur from the 3rd week after the blood stage becomes apparent.

The patient was promptly treated with suramin soon after transfer on 20 Feb 2012. Pretreatment blood analysis showed a high parasitemia, marked thrombocytopenia (47.000/=B5L), ALAT/ASAT 3x UNL, and moderately increased CRP. An ECG showed diffuse S-T elevation. So far no other complications occurred, and patient's condition is not life-threatening.

Acute rhodesiense trypanosomiasis has to be regarded as a medical emergency, requiring immediate treatment with suramin or, when suramin cannot be obtained within a day, with pentamidine. Treatment delay results often in a rapidly progressive multi-organ dysfunction with high mortality.

[This is the 2nd case of HAT in a tourist visiting Masai Mara within a month (see ProMED-mail posting Trypanosomiasis, human - Germany ex Kenya: Masai Mara 20120202.1031130).

A review of cases imported into trypanosomiasis non-endemic countries identified 95 cases from 19 countries (Simarro PP et al: Human African Trypanosomiasis in Non-Endemic Countries (2000-2010). J Trav Med 2012; 19(1): 44-53; available at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1708-8305.2011.00576.x/full).
Cited from the paper: "Cases of Rhodesiense HAT were mainly diagnosed in tourists after short visits to DECs [disease endemic countries], usually within a few days of return. The majority of them were in 1st stage. Initial misdiagnosis with malaria or tick-borne diseases was frequent. Cases of Gambiense HAT were usually diagnosed several months after initial examination and subsequent to a variety of misdiagnoses. The majority were in 2nd stage. Patients affected were expatriates living in DECs for extended periods and refugees or economic migrants from DECs."

The paper concludes that "the risk of HAT in travelers and migrants, albeit low, cannot be overlooked."
