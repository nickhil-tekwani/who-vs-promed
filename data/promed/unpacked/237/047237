Health officials in Mohave County are trying to track down the source
of a mysterious illness that has sickened more than 50 people.
The county has closed its immunization clinic in Bullhead City so
staff can concentrate effort on tracking the illness. It was 1st
reported a week ago and has sickened at least 57 people with
gastrointestinal symptoms.
Public Health Director, Patty Mead, said 25 people who attended a
gathering in Bullhead City 1st came down with the illness. Some live
out of state. Officials thought it was isolated, but 32 new reports
have since surfaced.
Mead said there's a growing concern that the source may still be present.

[There is a lot of information needed here to assess possible
etiologies of this presumed foodborne cluster including:
- what was the incubation period between the gathering and the onset
of illness?
- what specific gastrointestinal symptoms occurred?
- were the illnesses associated with fever or not?
- how long did the illness last?
- were there any cases in individuals who did not attend the gathering?
The etiology of the illnesses could be a biological toxin such as
staphylococcal enterotoxin, a virus such as a norovirus, or a
bacterium such as _Salmonella_, among others.
Mohave County, Arizona is located in the extreme northwestern part of
the state as can be seen at
