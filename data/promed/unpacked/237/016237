Pertussis Outbreak Among Adults at an Oil Refinery --- Illinois,
August-October 2002
------------------------
On 16 Sep 2002, the Crawford County Health Department (CCHD) reported to
the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) 4 cases of cough illness
among workers at an oil refinery (total worker population: 750) in Crawford
County, Illinois. On 14 Aug 2002, a worker aged 39 years reported to the
plant's health unit with a cough lasting 14 days. On the same day, the
worker's supervisor aged 50 years visited the health unit for a paroxysmal
cough of 3 days' duration and an incident of cough syncope. Both patients
were referred to private health-care providers; blood samples from both
patients had serologic test results suggestive of recent _Bordetella
pertussis_ infection, and CCHD was contacted. On 18 Sep 2002 IDPH and CCHD
initiated active surveillance and case investigations. This report
summarizes the results of that investigation, which found that during 1
Aug-9 Oct 2002 pertussis was diagnosed in 15 (10 percent) of 150 oil
refinery workers from 2 separate operations (n=95) and maintenance (n=55)
complexes, who were linked by contact with the ill supervisor. Through
enhanced case finding, 24 cases of pertussis, 21 (88 percent) of which
occurred in adults aged >20 years, were identified in this outbreak,
underscoring the need to recognize this highly infectious disease in adults
and to improve national diagnostic and preventive strategies.
A clinical case was defined as an acute cough illness lasting >2 weeks in a
person with 1) at least one of the following: paroxysms of coughing,
inspiratory "whoop," or post-tussive vomiting, without other apparent cause
or 2) >14 days of cough in a person in an outbreak setting. A confirmed
case was defined as a cough illness of any duration in a person with
isolation by culture of _B. pertussis_ or a case that met the clinical case
definition and was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for _B.
pertussis_ DNA or by epidemiologic linkage to a laboratory-confirmed case.
A probable case met the clinical case definition, was not
laboratory-confirmed, and was not linked by direct contact with a
laboratory-confirmed case. At the oil refinery, any worker reporting a
cough illness to the health unit was referred to the local community
hospital for evaluation for pertussis and interviewed by CCHD or IDPH staff
to establish onset of illness, symptoms, area of work and work schedules,
and information on all close contacts. Community cases were identified
through standard IDPH case report forms submitted by health-care providers
to CCHD for suspected cases of pertussis and then reviewed by the IDPH
immunization section to determine if the case definition was met.
As of 13 Dec 2002, a total of 17 cases of pertussis have been associated
with the oil refinery: 4 confirmed cases (including one culture-positive
case, one PCR-positive case, and 2 epidemiologically linked cases) and 13
probable cases; 10 patients were males. A pulsed-field gel electrophoresis
(PFGE) DNA fingerprint from the _B. pertussis_ isolate from the
culture-confirmed case (illness onset date: 10 Sep 2002) was PFGE profile
13. The median age of patients was 40 years (range: 16-53 years). 6
patients worked in the same work unit. 8 of 14 patients tested by a
private diagnostic laboratory had serologic testing results (anti-_B.
pertussis_ IgA, IgM, or IgG enzyme immunoassay) suggestive of recent _B.
pertussis_ infection. In addition to the 17 patients identified from the
oil refinery, 7 patients in the community who were unrelated
epidemiologically to the oil refinery also were identified as having
probable cases of pertussis; 4 were males with a median age of 24 years
(range: 5-33 years). All 24 patients received treatment with macrolide
antibiotics and were encouraged to be tested for pertussis by PCR and
nasopharyngeal culture. On 19 Sep 2002, with the cooperation of the oil
refinery management, 150 close work contacts of the 17 patients at the oil
refinery plant were prescribed azithromycin prophylaxis at a dose schedule
of 500 mg for the first day, followed by 250 mg daily for the next 4 days.
Other than a meeting lasting approximately 5 minutes conducted indoors each
morning, daily work assignments at the plant are performed outdoors.
However, workers may congregate in an indoor dining area reserved for lunch.
No cases of pertussis at the oil refinery have been reported since 9 Oct
2002. School officials and health-care providers within the community have
been given guidelines on pertussis case recognition, reporting, and
prophylaxis measures. IDPH and the local health department continue to
perform ongoing case ascertainment.
Editorial Note:
Among the diseases for which universal childhood vaccination is recommended
in the United States, only pertussis has increased in incidence in the
United States during the preceding 20 years, from 1730 cases in 1980 to
8296 cases provisionally reported in 2002 (1; CDC, unpublished data, 2002).
The outbreak described in this report reflects the changing demographics of
pertussis in the United States, with reported incidence rates in adults
increasing 400 percent during 1990-2001 (2; CDC, unpublished data, 2002).
Adults and adolescents might be a reservoir for _B. pertussis_ in the
community, because immunity from childhood vaccination declines beginning
5-15 years after the last pertussis vaccine dose (3). Despite increasing
recognition of pertussis as a disease affecting older children and adults,
pertussis often is overlooked in the differential diagnosis of cough
illness in this population (4). Pertussis can be highly infectious during
the 3 weeks after illness onset, and infection can spread to exposed
infants, who have the highest rates for complications and death (5). In
this outbreak, pertussis was not considered initially in the index
patient's 14-day cough illness until the patient's supervisor reported to
the oil refinery health unit concurrently with cough syncope, triggering
referral of both patients to the local community hospital for evaluation
for pertussis. Emblematic in this outbreak was the protracted duration of
cough symptoms in the first patient, followed by a comprehensive public
health response once several close contacts became infected and, late in
the outbreak, _B. pertussis_ was cultured successfully from an oil refinery
worker; isolation of _B. pertussis_ from an adult is uncommon.
In Illinois, 46 of 191 cases (24 percent) of reported pertussis in 2001
occurred in adults aged >20 years (incidence rate: 0.5 per 100 000
population), a proportion similar to that of cases in the United States
among this age group (1). Persons aged 10-19 years comprised 18 percent of
all cases in 2001 in Illinois. Waning vaccine-induced immunity probably
accounts for susceptibility to _B. pertussis_ infection in both adults and
adolescents (3,6). Since the 1980s, the reported incidence rates in
adolescents and adults in the United States have increased as a result of
changes in reporting, a true increase in incidence, or both (1,2). In 1995,
the case definition for pertussis was expanded to include PCR-positive
tests and epidemiologic linking of pertussis cases as confirmation
criteria. In addition, a possible increase in awareness of pertussis in
older age groups within the medical community during the 1990s might have
contributed to increased diagnosis rates in this population (7).
Adults with pertussis can have mild symptoms and might not seek medical
care, and clinicians might not consider pertussis as a cause of illness
(8). Although the fastidious _B. pertussis_ bacterium often cannot be
isolated, to confirm diagnosis in symptomatic adults, health-care providers
should obtain a nasopharyngeal aspirate or swab for _B. pertussis_ culture
within 2 weeks of cough onset. In this outbreak, serologic testing for
diagnosis of recent _B. pertussis_ infection was performed in the majority
of cases. No serologic assay for a single convalescent sera is currently
approved or recommended for serodiagnosis of pertussis. Because adults
might report to health-care providers late in the disease course, a
standardized and valid serologic test is needed to diagnose recent _B.
pertussis_ infection in adults (9).
As one of several state health departments with enhanced pertussis
surveillance systems, IDPH analyzes _B. pertussis_ isolates from cases by
PFGE. The single isolate in this outbreak indicated PFGE profile 13, the
most frequently identified pattern from _B. pertussis_ isolates in the
United States. Identification of pertussis DNA fingerprints by PFGE might
allow health officials to track disease transmission and associated outbreaks.
A 14-day course of erythromycin, a macrolide antibiotic with substantial in
vitro and in vivo activity against _B. pertussis_, is the recommended
antimicrobial for treatment of patients with pertussis and for prophylaxis
of close contacts. Treatment and prophylaxis are most effective when
erythromycin is administered to patients within 3 weeks of illness onset
and to close contacts within 3 weeks of cough onset in the primary case
(9). During an outbreak, repeated exposure to pertussis might warrant
repeated courses of erythromycin. If erythromycin is poorly tolerated
because of gastrointestinal side effects, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole can
be prescribed; azithromycin and clarithromycin might be effective
alternatives in the eradication of _B. pertussis_ in symptomatic patients
(9,10). However, effectiveness of azithromycin or clarithromycin as
prophylaxis for asymptomatic close contacts in an outbreak setting is not
well documented.
Outbreaks of pertussis in adults are controlled through prompt treatment of
patients and antimicrobial prophylaxis for close contacts. Acellular
pertussis vaccines are licensed in the United States for infants and
children aged 6 weeks-6 years (i.e., before the seventh birthday). These
vaccines might have a future role in the prevention of disease and control
of outbreaks in older age groups (4,5,7).
