Francisco Leopoldo Lemos, of the Management of Environmental Surveillance,
Superintendency of Epidemiology, Belo Horizonte, MG (tel 55 (31) 3261-4607;
fax 55(31)3261-2581) wrote to say that the case reported in "Yellow fever,
human, monkey - Brazil (MG) 20070421.1304" occurred in January 2002.
The unvaccinated victim survived. This year (2007) no human or monkey cases
have been reported. Vaccination coverage is high, and active surveillance
for human and monkey cases is ongoing.

[The comment on the original noted: "It is not clear why this is being
reported in the local press so late", in May when it was supposed to have
occurred in January. Now we know that it was an old piece resurrected.
Nevertheless, the alert against YF in Goias, Brazil, is current -- see 2nd
reference below. - Mod.JW]
