The Moderator [CHC contrasts diversity in rats with diversity in roses.
This betrays greater knowledge of rats than either roses or the literary
constructs we use to think about them. Gertrude Stein notwithstanding,
there is probably as great a variety of roses as there are of rats, which
is something to keep in mind when we begin to get postings about
rose-associated emerging infections.

[Uh, oh! I have crossed paths with a rose aficionado. When I rose this
morning and put on my rose-colored glasses I had no idea I'd be writing
this! There was the Canadian Minister of Finance John Rose, the American
lawyer Uriah Rose, the rose bug, the rose of Jericho, Saint Rose of Lima,
rose water, and the Rose Bowl. I once had a wife named Rose. I am certain
there are other roses. In the rose family (_Rosaceae_) are about 2,000
species of trees, shrubs, herbs, fruits and even flowers. The flowers most
of us call "rose" belongs to the genus _Rosa_, of which there are many
species, perhaps hundreds. However, all "roses" belong to the same genus.
That ain't the case with rats.
One of the reasons Linnaeus invented binomial nomenclature was so that
everyone could use the same terms for a single life form. _Turdus
migratorius_ is a "robin" in North America and _Turdus merula_ is a "robin"
in Europe and elsewhere. Thus, if one person says "robin", another
person may not know exactly what bird that person is trying to describe.

When I say "rat" I mean anything that is commonly called a rat: kangaroo
rat (_Dipodomys_ sp., of which I know at least 14), wood rat (also known as
packrats or trade rats; genus _Neotoma_; 8 species), black rat (_Rattus
rattus_), Norway rat (_Rattus norvegicus_), Rice rat (_Oryzomys
palustris_), Florida water rat (_Neofiber alleni_, really a muskrat),
muskrat (_Ondatra zibethica_), and cotton rat (_Sigmodon hispidus_) -- and
these are just the North American rats.
If this is confusing, I have made my point. Roses belong to a single
genus; the term "rats" is simply a generic name for hairy things that go
bump in the night and are dietarily proscribed in Leviticus. One cannot
eradicate a hantavirus by killing "rats" unless one wipes out the specific
species of rat that is carrying the specific rat hantavirus. If a
long-tailed rat that lives in apple orchards is carrying hantavirus X,
there is no point in killing short-tailed rats that live in orange groves.

Having covered the Bible, a former wife, a cartoon character, robins, a
Swedish taxonomist, a Canadian financier, and apple and oranges, I think
I'd best cut this string before Jack Woodall has a cow (err --- a bovine of
the female persuasion). -- Mod CHC
