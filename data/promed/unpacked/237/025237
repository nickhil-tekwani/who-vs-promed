Diarrhoea Outbreak Claims 31 lives in Gokwe
-----------------------------------------------------
The [rural area] of Gokwe in Zimbabwe was last month [June 2007] hit
by a diarrhoea outbreak that has so far claimed 31 lives. The most
affected have been children aged below 5. A total of 17 people died
in Masita in Gokwe South while 14 others died in Siamchembo in Gokwe North.
Speaking in a telephone interview, Deputy Minister of Health and
Child Welfare Dr. Edwin Muguti, however said the situation was under
control after officials from his ministry moved in swiftly to the
affected areas. Dr. Muguti said the cause of the outbreak had not
been ascertained as investigations were still ongoing. "I can confirm
that 14 people have died in Siamchembo area in Gokwe North while
another 17 died in Masita in Gokwe South," he said.
"We suspect that the diarrhoea outbreak is being caused by rotavirus
[infection] which is rife during winter [in the southern hemisphere -
Mod.CP]. Personnel from the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare have
been deployed and are on the ground doing community surveillance on
new cases and advising on how to manage the cases at home. The teams
are also distributing oral rehydration salts in the affected areas
and as far as we are concerned, the situation is now under control."
Dr. Muguti said most of the children died before reaching health
centres after failing to get assistance at their homes. "Lives were
lost that could have been saved because of lack of information. Most
homes failed to prepare the oral rehydration solution because of the
sugar shortage in their areas. This contributed to the high death
rate. They could still have saved lives by simply boiling water and
observing basic hygiene standards," he said. "We urge the villagers
to wash their hands all the time before handling or consuming any
food." The deputy minister expressed gratitude to Medicins San
Frontiers and UNICEF who moved in swiftly and worked together with
ministry officials to contain the outbreak.
Villagers in some parts of Gokwe North said the outbreak was a result
of water shortages in the affected areas. They said they were being
forced to fetch water from unprotected sources, a development that
could have contributed to the outbreak of the disease. The 2
districts of Gokwe have perennial water problems.

[This outbreak of diarrhoeal illness is being attributed to rotavirus
infection due to the young age of the victims and an association with
inadequate water supply, but a final laboratory diagnose is awaited.
Rotavirus infection is the most common cause of severe diarrhea among
children and is responsible for the deaths of more than 600 000
children world-wide per year with 80 percent of deaths occurring in
poorer countries. The incubation period for rotavirus illness is
approximately 2 days and the disease is characterized by vomiting and
watery diarrhea for 3 to 8 days, frequently with fever and abdominal
pain. Immunity after infection is incomplete, but repeat infections
tend to be less severe than the initial infection. The severe outcome
of rotavirus infection in infants and young children can be
ameliorated by prompt rehydration therapy and attention to basic hygiene.
Vaccination may soon be an option for control of rotavirus infection.
The 1st rotavirus vaccines have not been not deployed widely on
account of association with a low frequency of intussusception
(invagination of the intestine) [see ProMED-mail references below].
New rotavirus vaccines and their availability in the developing world
are highlighted in the June 2007 issue of the Bulletin of the World
Health Organization
(<http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/85/6/07-020607/en/print.html>).
This report describes advances and partnerships that have made recent
progress possible, along with the next steps needed to bring the
vaccines to the world's children at highest risk for severe diarrheal
disease. Rotavirus vaccines are increasingly becoming a crucial
component of strategies to control diarrheal disease in low-resource
countries, alongside proven interventions such as hand-washing, use
of oral rehydration solution, and exclusive breast-feeding.
