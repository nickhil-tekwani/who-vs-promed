It has been raining in [Kenya] since March [2018], adding more pressure on farming. Crop farmers are grappling mainly with blight and bacterial wilt. The diseases have attacked coffee, tomatoes, onions, and potatoes. Even as they save on irrigation water, the farmers have to invest heavily in pesticides. The 2 diseases are a huge threat to the crops because they lead to 100 per cent loss if not checked.

The blight has attacked coffee in main production areas in central Kenya threatening the cash crop. Farmers in Nyeri, Murang'a, and Kiambu [counties] are currently grappling with the disease, which they say is attacking their crop for the first time in years. "It is the first time it is being heard of in Nyeri," said [a farmer].

Caroline Wandia, agronomist in Nyeri, said bacterial blight in coffee is normally favored by cool, wet weather. "Normally, lesions appear on leaves with water soaked margins when the infection begins. The leaves eventually dry up and roll inwards as they turn brown," she said. She added that the same symptoms are observed with tomatoes, onions and potatoes when attacked by blight.

[Bacterial blight (also called Elgon dieback) of coffee is caused by _Pseudomonas coronafaciens_ (previously _syringae_) pv. _garcae_. It was named after Gar√ßa, the place of its 1st identification in Brazil.

Bacterial wilts of tomato and potato caused by _Ralstonia solanacearum_ (previously _Pseudomonas solanacearum_) are amongst the major diseases of these crops. _R. solanacearum_ affects more than 200 plant species including many important crops and has been classified into various races and biovars active under different climatic conditions and affecting different hosts.

A bacterial leaf blight of onion and related allium crops is caused by _Xanthomonas_ species and pathovars.

It is not clear whether all the blights above are considered to be bacterial. Late blight of potato and tomato caused by the fungus-like organism (oomycete) _Phytophthora infestans_ is also rife in the region and may contribute to the problems. Although symptoms on all crops are reported to be "the same" in the story above, these resemble general symptoms of blight and wilt diseases and it appears unlikely that they are due to the same pathogen on all the different crops. The humid conditions reported here favour a wide range of both bacterial and fungal pathogens.
