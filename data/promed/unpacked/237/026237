A study was carried out in Russia in 2015-2018. Potato (_Solanum tuberosum_) samples were collected from commercial fields in 11 regions. Analysis of 1025 leaf and 725 tuber samples confirmed the earlier reported data on the dominance of potato viruses Y, S, and M in most regions of European Russia, as well as relatively high incidences of _Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_ (EPPO A2 List), _Pectobacterium atrosepticum_, and _P. carotovorum_ subsp. _carotovorum_.

The following records are new for EPPO:
- _Ralstonia solanacearum_ (EPPO A2 List) was detected in 2 samples from Kostroma region (Central Russia). This is the 1st documented report for Russia.
- _Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_ (EPPO A2 List) in Eastern Siberia (Irkutsk region).
- _Dickeya dianthicola_ (EPPO A2 List) in Eastern Siberia (Irkutsk region).
- _Potato spindle tuber viroid_ (_Pospiviroid_, PSTVd - EPPO A2 List) in Eastern Siberia (Irkutsk region).
- _Potato mop-top virus_ (_Pomovirus_, PMTV) in Central Russia (Leningrad region), Southern Russia (Samara region) and Eastern Siberia (Irkutsk).

[1. Brown rot (also called bacterial wilt) of potato is caused by _Ralstonia solanacearum_ race 3 (biovar 2, adapted to cooler temperatures) or race 1 (prevalent in warmer areas). Yield losses are mostly caused by tuber rotting. It has long been considered absent from Russia, but over recent years multiple interceptions have been recorded in imported ware potatoes of different origins (for example, ProMED-mail posts 20140527.2500654 and 20180327.5712463). Despite phytosanitary measures having been taken, it appears from the above that the disease has now established itself in the country.

2. _Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_ causes bacterial ring rot disease of potato. Yield losses of up to 50 percent have been reported. Many solanaceous species, including tomato and aubergine, are also susceptible. The pathogen has also been found associated with symptomless infections of sugar beet and sugar beet seed. A new strain of ssp. _michiganensis_ which is known to cause bacterial canker of tomato, has recently been identified on potato in Russia (ProMED-mail 20190301.6342985).

3. Several species and subspecies of bacteria in the genera _Dickeya_ and _Pectobacterium_ are known to cause blackleg and bacterial soft rot of potato, both serious diseases of the crop. Population shifts of the blackleg pathogens are being observed in Europe and other regions. The pathogens can also affect other crops, causing, for example, a foot rot disease in rice as well as stem and root rot of sweet potato.

4. _Potato spindle tuber viroid_ (genus _Pospiviroid_) is an important pathogen of solanaceous crops. Yield losses can be up to 65 percent in potato. It is widely distributed in Russia, including some novel strains, due to a suspected distribution of infected tissue cultures from central national facilities (ProMED-mail post 20070423.1323). Spread occurs via infected tubers or plants, seed, pollen, mechanical means, plant-to-plant contact or in the presence of _Potato leaf roll virus_ by a aphids.

5. _Potato mop-top virus_ (genus _Pomovirus_,) is spreading in Eurasia and the Americas. Tuber yield may or may not be reduced, but economic losses are due to tuber symptoms called "spraing" which severely affect quality. PMTV is spread by the potato powdery scab protozoan pathogen _Spongospora subterranea_ which causes a serious disease of the crop in itself.

6. _Potato virus S_ , _Potato virus M_ (both genus _Carlavirus_), and _Potato virus Y_ (type member of genus _Potyvirus_) are amongst the most widely distributed viruses of the crop. PVY is one of the most damaging, affecting crop yields and tuber quality. It is transmitted by aphids and can also affect tomato, capsicum and some other related species.

Potato is vegetatively propagated and the viruses are also disseminated in tubers. If infected seed tubers are used, virus populations will gradually build up during every crop cycle, both in number of co-infecting (possibly synergistic) virus species and in amounts of infectious units per species. This invariably leads to severely reduced plant vigour and a dramatic drop in yield.
