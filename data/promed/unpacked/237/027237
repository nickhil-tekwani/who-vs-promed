Thailand: storks, leopard reportedly had avian virus in Thai zoo
----------------------------------------------------------------
Test results showed 3 migratory Asian openbill storks that died in
Nakhon Sawan had the H5N1 sub-type of avian flu, but authorities said
it was unlikely they had carried this virulent strain from abroad.
Natural Resources and Environment Minister Praphat Panyachartrak also
said a clouded leopard at Khao Khiew Zoo in Chon Buri was confirmed
to have died of bird flu, while a white tiger also caught the disease
but is recovering and now under close surveillance.

"A study is needed to find if the storks caught the disease from
chickens," Mr Praphat said on Thursday [12 Feb 2004], insisting his
ministry would not order mass culling of this bird species without
sound scientific proof that the storks were carriers of the disease.

Hundreds of openbill storks have died at Bung Boraphet swamp in
Nakhon Sawan and Bangkok's Lat Krabang district, where poultry
infected with bird flu were found. An official said the mass death of
storks in Lat Krabang had prompted the Agriculture Ministry to demand
that up to 20 000 migratory openbill storks be killed.

Samples of the storks living at Phut Khao bird park in Lat Krabang
and at Wang Nam Priew in Chachoengsao province were collected by
environment officials on Wednesday [11 Feb 2004] for testing.

Mr Praphat suspected some of the storks could have been exposed to
avian flu in Thailand after their arrival late last year [2003]. He
said it was unlikely the storks were carriers of the H5N1 variant
because they all came from Bangladesh, where there have been no
reports about the H5N1 strain so far. "We'd better tell Bangladesh to
keep a close watch on the birds on their return," he said. The storks
are expected to start their journey again in May [2004].

Hundreds of storks at 2 bird sanctuaries outside Bangkok have died of
the bird flu that has struck Asia's poultry farms, but there are no
plans to destroy the wildlife in the area, officials said Tuesday [10
Feb 2004].

Some 500 openbill storks were found dead in Lat Krabang district and
300 birds had died at the Bueng Boraphet wetland in Nakhon Sawan
province since 27 Jan 2004, said Minister of Natural Resources and
Environment Prapat Panyachatraksa on Tuesday [10 Feb 2004].

Laboratory tests found 30 percent to 40 percent of the dead storks,
which are migratory birds, were infected with bird flu virus, he said.

Dusit Zoo might be reopened this week [week of 18 Feb 2004] if lab
checks find no fresh outbreak of bird flu among the crows that use
the zoo for nesting, Natural Resources and Environment Minister
Prapat Panyachatraksa said yesterday [17 Feb 2004]. "The zoo has been
shut down for over 20 days, causing hardship for animals and humans
alike," he said.

Prapat warned against hasty reaction to the spread of bird flu among
wild and migrating birds, saying the situation had not spiralled out
of control as feared. "None of the pigeons that fly over Bangkok's
skies have been found to be infected with bird flu," he said.

The country's largest lake, Bung Boraphet in Nakhon Sawan, was
declared under quarantine on Monday [16 Feb 2004] after 17 out of
more than 10 000 migrating openbill storks died from the virus, he
said. Migrating storks in the Wat Pailom sanctuary in Pathum Thani
have not been infected with the deadly virus, although a few in a
separate flock at Bangkok's Lat Krabang district have been. Livestock
officials have been conducting daily checks on bird sanctuaries and
have found about 30 percent of dead bird carcasses could be
attributed to bird flu.

Hundreds of wild birds have died of avian influenza in the central
province of Nakhon Sawan of Thailand in a little over 2 weeks, the
Wildlife Conservation Division disclosed.

Director Chawal Thalhikorn was quoted by the Thai News Agency as
saying Saturday [5 Feb 2005] that his organization had been
monitoring the bird flu situation among wild birds closely. He said
between 18 Jan and 3 Feb [2005], almost 500 openbill storks had been
found dead at the Boraphet reservoir, Thailand's largest freshwater
swamp. Officials had burned the carcasses and sprayed disinfectant to
prevent the spread of disease.

In other control efforts, the director said more than 6800 birds from
80 species in 7 provinces had been tested for the deadly H5N1 strain
of the virus. The result of the tests will be disclosed soon.

However, he said testing by other agencies had found the bird flu
virus in 11 samples collected from 4 central provinces, including
Sukhothai, Uthai Thani, Lopburi, and Chachoengsao.

[This would suggest that this is an ongoing problem that fell below
the radar for a few years, and returned with excited headlines of
"thousands" of deaths. However I can find no ProMED reports on
openbill storks in Thailand in 2004 and 2005. Under the circumstances
I think we can accept Dr Praphat's original statement that these
migratory storks got infected when they arrived in Thailand. -
