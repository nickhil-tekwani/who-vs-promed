A serious bacterial cattle disease has been identified at 3 more farms in New Zealand, raising the number of affected farms to 6, the country's Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) said on [Tue 29 Aug 2017].

Two of the farms that reported positive results for the _Mycoplasma bovis_ disease belong to the Van Leeuwen Dairy Group, which also owns the 1st 2 farms to report the bacteria in July [2017].

The owner of the 3rd unnamed farm in the country's South Island had received a small number of calves from another infected farm, the ministry said in an emailed statement. "We fully expect to find more infected properties as we continue our tracing and testing programme," MPI Response Coordinator David Yard said, adding that there was no evidence the disease was spreading without close contact to infected animals.

_Mycoplasma bovis_ is common in many countries and can lead to conditions such as udder infection, pneumonia, and arthritis in affected cattle, but does not pose a food safety risk or any risk to humans.

News of the outbreak in July [2017] briefly knocked the New Zealand currency given the importance of the cattle industry to the economy, with dairy the country's largest export good.

[We know the MPI is investigating how this pathogen got into the country. This particular pathogen causes a variety of clinical signs from respiratory, to arthritis, and mastitis and can be difficult to diagnose. It can be an aggressive pathogen, therefore it is not unexpected that MPI has found, and expects to find more cases of this disease. - Mod.TG
