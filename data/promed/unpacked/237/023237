Bulgaria is bordered by Romania to the north, Serbia and Republic of Macedonia to the west, Greece and Turkey to the south, and the Black Sea to the east.

LSD is endemic in Turkey. In its last semi-annual report (July to December 2015), Turkey reported 444 outbreaks of LSD. See report at http://tinyurl.com/ja36amn, and refer to Section 3 for outbreak details.

Greece has reported 117 outbreaks since the event started on 18 Aug 2015; see last follow up report (21 Jan 2016) at, http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000019402_20160121_174211.pdf.

According to information found in the OIE WAHID database, in Romania (annual report 2015), Serbia (semi-annual report January to June 2015) and Former Yugoslav Rep of Macedonia (annual report 2015) LSD has been reported as "disease never occurred".
