Bird flu case detected at chicken farm in east Japan
----------------------------------------------------
Chickens at a farm in Konosu, Tokyo's neighboring Saitama Prefecture in
east Japan, have tested positive for bird flu virus, the Ministry of
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said Thursday [18 Aug 2005].
The virus detected is of the H5 variety but is considered to be a weaker
type, because no mass deaths have occurred at the farm, according to the
ministry.
The Saitama prefectural government has decided to cull the farm's 98 300
chickens and ban the transfer of chickens and eggs within 5 kilometers from
the farm, which produces eggs for processed food.
Japan reported an outbreak of bird flu, the 1st in the country since 1925,
in Yamaguchi Prefecture in December 2004.
