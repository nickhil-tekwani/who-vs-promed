Malaria has claimed 3 lives in the city this month [May 2010] and
more than 1250 people have tested positive for the disease. Doctors
are surprised at the rise in the number of malaria cases, as they
usually plummet in summer.

In April 2010, at least 3122 Mumbaiites tested positive, and 2 people
died of the disease. This is more than double the number of cases in
April 2009, which saw 1351 people diagnosed with malaria. In April
2008, only 790 people contracted the disease.

Transmitted by the bite of infected mosquitoes, a spurt in malaria is
normal during the monsoon and post-monsoon period as mosquitoes breed
in stagnant water.

"When temperature crosses 40 C, it slows mosquito breeding. But the
temperature in Mumbai is lower than that, and the humidity level is
high, so mosquitoes are continuing to breed," said Dr Ashok Bhosale,
state project director of the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme.

The maximum number of cases has been reported from central Mumbai,
Lower Parel, Worli and Elphinstone Road. On Friday [14 May 2010], 21
people who went to KEM Hospital's Out Patient Department tested
positive for malaria. "I am surprised to see so many malaria cases in
the summer. We usually get 2-6 malaria cases a day," said a resident
doctor at KEM.

Civic officials believe the rise in construction activity is
facilitating mosquito breeding. "Water stagnates or is left
unattended on slabs at the construction sites, and it allows for
breeding," said G.T. Ambe, BMC executive health officer.

The BMC used to fumigate construction sites, but from 1 May 2010, the
responsibility has been handed over to builders.

[Mumbai is usually regarded as a low risk area for malaria. The
report indicates that a change in the organization of mosquito
control measures could be one explanation. - Mod.EP]
