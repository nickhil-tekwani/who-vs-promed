Yellow fever disease has reportedly killed 80 people in refugee camps in Sudan's Blue Nile region.

The camps are the homes to people fleeing the fighting between the Khartoum government forces and the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) North rebels.

A food security officer in the region, Mr Simawi Adlan, told Tamzog, a local radio station, that yellow fever outbreaks had been reported at Doro and Batil camps on the border between Sudan and Ethiopia. "Around 80 people died because of this disease just last June [2013]," he confirmed.

Mr Adlan attributed the cause to pollution and unsanitary conditions in the camps. He warned of a more serious health disaster in the camps, urging aid organisations to provide latrines for the refugees.

The government of Sudan has been battling SPLM\North in South Kordofan and Blue Nile states since June 2011. Khartoum has denied international humanitarian organisations access to the affected areas since the eruption of the war.

[There is no indication that these reported 80 fatal yellow fever (YF) cases have been laboratory confirmed. It is critical that this be done quickly, as the risk of further spread is doubtless high.

It is unfortunate that international humanitarian medical teams have been denied access to the area. Without their assessment and medical aid, the situation could easily get out of hand and become very difficult to control if these really are YF virus infections and not illnesses and fatalities due to some other pathogen. Assessment of the situation and establishment of reliable diagnoses of these cases are urgent. With 80 deaths, if this is a YF outbreak with the usual 20-30 per cent case fatality rate, one would expect there to be an additional 130 or more non-fatal cases.

The largest YF outbreak in Africa in 20 years just ended earlier this year [2013] in the Darfur region of Sudan. The Blue Nile region is distant, across the country in the southeast area of Sudan. If the Blue Nile outbreak is YF, the distance between this and the last outbreak suggests that they are not related.
