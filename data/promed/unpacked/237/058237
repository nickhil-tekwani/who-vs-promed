["Acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND), initially referred to as early mortality syndrome (EMS), is a shrimp disease caused by some pathogenic strains of _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ and likely some pathogenic strains of other _Vibrio_ species in the _Vibrio harveyi_ group. AHPND emerged as a new disease in 2009; it has resulted in severe mortality in farmed penaeid shrimp and significant economic losses in South East Asia and Mexico. AHPND most frequently occurs within the first 30 days after stocking a newly prepared shrimp pond.

"Infected shrimp show lethargy, slow growth, an empty stomach and midgut and a pale to white atrophied hepatopancreas.

"AHPND has caused severe mortalities in farmed penaeid shrimp throughout South East Asia and Mexico. Countries reporting AHPND include China, Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines and Mexico". http://www.cabi.org/isc/datasheet/121558. - Mod CRD
