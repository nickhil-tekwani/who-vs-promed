WEST NILE VIRUS UPDATE 2004 - WESTERN HEMISPHERE (08): CORRECTION

The recent ProMED-mail posting entitled "WEST NILE VIRUS UPDATE 2004
-WESTERN HEMISPHERE (08) 20040723.2011", article [4] included several
factual errors that I would hope could be corrected.
1. All veterinary vaccines used in the United States are licensed by
the Center for Veterinary Biologics (CVB) in Ames, Iowa, a part of
the USDA's Animal & Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS),
Veterinary Services.
The FDA (Food and Drug Administration) does not license or approve
veterinary vaccines, but is responsible for regulation of
pharmacologic agents ("drugs") for both humans and animals. The West
Nile virus vaccines to which the posting referred are licensed by the
USDA-CVB, not the FDA.
2. The posting states the vaccines were allowed to be used "...
months before ... safety and effectiveness had been fully tested."
This is not correct. The CVB does not allow any product to be sold
for use until their safety has been established. No exception was
granted for the West Nile virus vaccines. The 1st West Nile virus
vaccine for horses became available in 2001 after extensive field
testing for safety; it was initially granted a conditional license
because lack of a challenge model at that time did not allow
definitive efficacy tests in horses to be conducted. Both West Nile
virus vaccines are now fully licensed by the USDA-CVB. Safety and
efficacy data are on file.
Thank you for the opportunity to correct these errors.
