Nebraska state officials admit they are stumped over a spike in
_Salmonella_ cases across eastern Nebraska. State Epidemiologist Dr
Tom Safranek says 14 cases have been reported in just the last 10
days, and there are likely more out there that will be reported in
the days ahead.

Despite an intense investigation, Safranek says health officials are
"scratching their heads" and are now doing more detailed interviews
with the victims trying to figure out if there is some sort of common
thread with the cases, like where the victims ate or shopped and what
they ate. Dr Safranek says, "These individuals have a common
exposure, whether it was the same venue, a restaurant, or in a
distributed fashion or common food item."

Of the 14 confirmed cases, 11 are women 20 to 49 years of age. 8 are
in Douglas County, 4 in Sarpy, 1 in Cass, and 1 in Lancaster County.
2 were hospitalized.

A small outbreak of salmonella poisoning has been confirmed in the
Omaha area and other parts of southeast Nebraska. There have been 14
confirmed cases so far, and a state health official expects that
there will be more.

Dr Tom Safranek, Nebraska state epidemiologist, said that he believes
the cases are connected because they were all caused by the same
strain of bacteria. He said there probably have been more cases tied
to the outbreak that were never confirmed. The confirmed cases
occurred between 2 and 13 Feb 2009 and involved people ranging in age
from their teens to their 40s. Safranek said he does not believe the
cases are part of the national salmonella outbreak tied to peanut
products because those cases were caused by a different strain.

Nebraska had more than 200 confirmed cases of salmonella each of the
past 2 years and most were unrelated, he said. The state does get
several outbreaks per year and usually those cases can be traced to a
restaurant, church potluck [meal], or some other common source,
Safranek said.

The recent outbreak is different, he said, because health officials
so far have not been able to trace the cases to a common source.

[Serotype Saintpaul is the type associated with the tomato/jalapeno
outbreak in the USA in 2008. Although not specifically stated in the
posting above, it was mentioned in a commercial lawyer website that
these cases are not genetically linked to that outbreak.
