A rare heroin-related disease strikes the Bay Area
---------------------------------------------------
On 29 Nov 2004, the 1st of several people wandered into Bay Area county
hospitals with slurred speech, drooping eyelids, and difficulty swallowing.
By 2 Dec 2004, at least 3 patients were paralyzed above the waist and
required mechanical ventilation.
The mysterious, rapidly progressing illness turned out to be wound botulism
-- a rare disease caused by a toxin in _Clostridium botulinum_ bacteria.
Alameda and San Francisco County public health officials immediately
notified the California Department of Health Services of the outbreak,
which later alerted the CDC.
Like most recent victims of wound botulism, the 6 patients recognized have
one characteristic in common: They are all black-tar heroin users who
contracted the toxin-releasing bacteria from a dirty drug batch.
Botulism cases always raise alarm, because _C. botulinum_ is not only a
bioterrorism agent, but also causes a particularly nasty disease. Exposed
victims experience rapid descending paralysis, or gradual loss of muscle
control beginning with the smaller muscles in the head and moving downward.
By the time 3 of the 6 patients -- one of whom is an Alameda County
resident -- made it to San Francisco General Hospital, they were in
critical condition. In the coming weeks -- or even months -- they will need
around-the-clock intensive care.
Wound botulism is a primarily Californian disease. The state has 75 percent
of the cases in the USA, which in turn has 90 percent of the cases reported
across the globe. The illness was virtually unheard of prior to 1988, but
since then California has seen a 20-fold increase in infections. Experts at
the California Department of Health Services believe the recent surge in
cases can be explained by 2 related developments in the heroin-using
community: the increase in popularity of black-tar heroin from Mexico, and
the practice of "skin popping," or injecting heroin into soft tissue rather
than veins.
Repeated injections cause abscesses to form, creating a favorable climate
for neurotoxin-producing bacteria like _C. botulinum_.

[There are 7 toxin produced by different _C. botulinum_ types which are
immunologically distinct but produce a clinically similar and highly
recognizable syndrome by similar pharmacological mechanisms. The molecular
site of action and some clinical features, however, differ.
All the toxins are translated as single polypeptide chains of similar
structure that are nicked by proteases. The protease nick yields a light
chain of approximately 50kD containing a catalytic subunit (a
zinc-dependent metallo-endopeptidase) responsible for the toxic effects and
a heavy chain of about 100kD that binds the target tissue. Both clostridial
proteolytic enzymes and human digestive enzymes such as trypsin can
activate the toxin.
All toxin types exert their action on the cholinergic system at the
presynapic motor-neuron terminal by blocking acetylcholine transmission
across the neuromuscular junction. Toxins types A and E enzymatically
cleave a specific presynaptic membrane-associated protein; toxin types B,
D, F and G cleave a synaptic vesicle-associated protein. Type C toxin
cleaves both the membrane-associated protein targeted by types A and E and
an additional protein associated with exocytosis. The effect in all cases
is neuromuscular blockade resulting in flaccid paralysis. The toxins also
affect the adrenergic system but apparently with insignificant consequences.
Toxin type A causes most cases of foodborne and wound botulism in the
United States. The syndrome produced by toxin type A is most severe, with
more rapid progression of paralysis and a higher proportion of patients
requiring mechanical ventilation. - Mod.LL]
