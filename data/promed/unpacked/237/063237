China reports new bird flu outbreak in Hubei
-----------------------------------------------
China has confirmed a fresh outbreak of the deadly H5N1 bird flu
virus in poultry in its central Hubei province, the Hong Kong
government said on Saturday [12 Nov 2005], Reuters reported.
"The Health, Welfare and Food Bureau received notification from the
Ministry of Agriculture of the Mainland last night, of an H5N1 avian
influenza outbreak among poultry in Jingshan country in Hubei
province" the Hong Kong government said in a statement.
This latest outbreak comes as China is battling to control 7 other
outbreaks since the beginning [of] October 2005.
The Liaoning Provincial Control Office of Highly Pathogenic Avian
Flu, on Saturday [12 Nov 2005], ruled out 6 suspected highly
pathogenic bird flu outbreaks in this northeast China province. Zhou
Liyuan, spokesman for the office, told a press conference that the
judgment was concluded, as the quarantine tests conducted by the
provincial animal epidemic prevention station lab turned out negative
for highly pathogenic avian flu virus.
The office has erased Nanwa Village in Xinmin City of Shenyang,
Jintun Village of Jinzhou City, Bajiazi Village of Jinzhou, Guojia
Village of Jinzhou, the Beizhen Street of Beining City in Jinzhou and
Yujiatun Village of Heishan County from the bird flu blacklist.
In bird-flu-hit Heishan County, no new cases have been reported for
the last 2 days. In bird-flu-hit Beining City, no new cases have been
reported for the last 4 days. In Nanzhan New District of Jinzhou, no
new cases have been reported since 6 Nov 2005. In New Mongolia
Autonomous County of Fuxin City, no new cases have been reported
since 8 Nov 2005, all as listed by the spokesman.
He said that the provincial government has allocated 15.5 million
yuan (USD 1.9 million) to compensate the farmers for their loss due
to poultry culling. A total of 265.8 million yuan (USD 33 million)
has been put into epidemic prevention in the province.
Zhang Wenyue, governor of Liaoning Province, has pledged the
government would compensate farmers for every poultry head culled for
epidemic prevention. According to the province's compensation
standard, farmers are compensated with 10 yuan (USD 1.25) for each of
their chickens and ducks slaughtered in quarantine, 15 yuan (USD
1.87) for a goose and 5 yuan (USD 0.65) for every young fowl.
The spokesman said that hospitals in bird flu-hit areas in Liaoning
have been ordered to accept flu patients regardless of medical
charges, which will be later drawn from the provincial finances.

Bird Flu Controls Stepped Up Across China
-----------------------------------------------
Most Chinese cities and provinces have taken further strong steps to
prevent and control avian influenza, according to the Chinese
Ministry of Agriculture.
It is reported that local communities have set up contingency plans
against a serious animal epidemic, and increased funds and resources
are being devoted to the prevention and control of bird flu.
Governments have also proposed that the density of poultry farming
should be reduced and that the monitoring of flocks for bird flu be
intensified to prevent the disease from spreading.
Cases of infection with the deadly H5N1 avian flu virus, which is
highly infectious in birds, have occurred in China's Inner Mongolia
region and in Anhui, Hunan, Liaoning and Hubei provinces since the
middle of October 2005.
Government departments have culled over 10 million domestic birds in
the infected areas.

Processed poultry: Strict checks ordered
---------------------------------------------
The nation's quality watchdog said yesterday [Sun 13 Nov 2005] that
it would check processed poultry to ensure that no birds come from
regions affected by bird flu, even as veterinary workers cull
hundreds of thousands of fowl to curb the spread of the disease.
The inspections will cover 16 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions.
It will also check the quality of disinfectants used for combating
bird flu, the General Administration of Quality Supervision,
Inspection and Quarantine of China said in a statement yesterday [13
Nov 2005].
Regions where inspectors will fan out include areas that have been
stricken by the fatal bird flu virus this year [2005]: Qinghai, Inner
Mongolia, Anhui, Hubei, Hunan and Liaoning, and 10 others, including
Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and Hebei.
The efforts are to help protect the health and restore the confidence
of consumers, whose appetite for poultry has waned, according to
experts.
Quality supervisors will check the food production permits of poultry
product makers and impose tough penalties on firms which do not have
them.
In particular, inspectors will look for proof of the makers,
especially those in the vicinity of an outbreak site, to ensure that
the birds have been certified by quarantine authorities and that no
dead or sick chicken, ducks or geese were used, it said. Violators
will be dealt with severely.
The inspectors will also see to it that no fake or shoddy
disinfectants, such as bleaching powder, caustic soda or peractic
acid, enter the market.
In the Chinese capital, the municipal health bureau said on Saturday
[12 Nov 2005] that not a single case of human infection had been
detected after major hospitals in Beijing checked about 850 000
people.
In its latest effort to prevent bird flu, the city shut down and
disinfected an illegal pigeon fair in Beishatan on Saturday [12 Nov
2005].
In Northeast China's Liaoning Province, which reported its 1st case
of fatal bird flu on 3 Nov 2005, the provincial office handling the
disease gave the all-clear in 6 suspected outbreaks on Saturday [12
Nov 2005].

[The above 3 news items from China's media underline the severity
with which the authorities consider the situation. Typically, they
also claim the need to "restore the confidence of consumers, whose
appetite for poultry has waned, according to experts." Real-value
compensations to farmers for culled birds are essential if their
cooperation is sought; without such cooperation, no control program
will effectively work.
Another crucial issue is the control and certification of vaccines
and disinfectants. Clearly, there is ample room for improvement
thereof. A recent example, kindly forwarded by Martin Williams, is a
news item from today's (13 Nov 2005) South China Morning Post. It
reports the distribution of an unlicensed AI vaccine in Liaoning
province, smuggled from Inner Mongolia, where the producer allegedly
released it before completion of testing. Reportedly, this vaccine
"offered little protection against the deadly disease."
Enhanced law enforcement is essential, but this stick must go
hand-in-hand with the carrot of subsidizing certified, efficacious
preparations and biologicals in order to compete with illegal,
uncertified cheap ones of inferior quality. - Mod.AS]
