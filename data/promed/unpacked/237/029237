New Zealand is free from Equine Influenza
---------------------------------------
I am replying to the ProMED post published on 5 Sep 2015, Subject: PRO/AH/EDR> Equine influenza, equine - Malaysia (02): spread (Archive Number: 20150905.3626182). In your report the Malaysian authorities were quoted in local news media as suggesting that the origin of their current outbreak was likely to be horses imported from New Zealand. This is incorrect. Equine influenza (EI) is NOT present in New Zealand.

The New Zealand Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) has received no official information from the Malaysian authorities in relation to their outbreak investigations, other than their notification to the OIE. However, in response to the ProMED report, we have traced back the export consignment and visited the premises of origin. There is no evidence of suspicious equine respiratory disease on any of the properties of origin for the 4 horses that were exported to Malaysia, now or in the last two months. MPI has contacted the Singapore veterinary authorities and established that New Zealand horses exported to Singapore on the same flight as the horses exported to Malaysia have not reported any signs of respiratory disease since arrival, nor have other in-contact horses.

Prior to leaving New Zealand at the end of July (i.e. approximately 2 months ago), the 4 horses that were exported to Malaysia via Singapore were held for 14 days in pre-export isolation in a dedicated horse export quarantine facility. During this time they were tested PCR negative for EI (N.B. Testing for EI is a transit requirement for Singapore, not a requirement for New Zealand horses exported to Malaysia). The 4 horses exported to Malaysia were not vaccinated for EI prior to departure from New Zealand. The 17 horses on the same flight from New Zealand to Singapore were vaccinated for EI.

New Zealand maintains strict import controls to ensure EI is not introduced by horses imported from countries that are not free. Official biosecurity import standards include requirements for premises of origin freedom; vaccination of imported horses with approved vaccines containing recommended strains of the virus; freedom from clinical signs on the day of export; testing in pre-export isolation; and repeat testing during 14 days post-arrival quarantine after arrival in New Zealand. New Zealand has an effective exotic disease surveillance system, and there is no indication of EI infection anywhere in this country.

In conclusion, New Zealand remains free of EI, in line with our regular reports to the OIE and official MPI certification for exports of horses.

Yours sincerely

[ProMED regrets the delay in posting this important clarification, due to a technical hitch. In comments to that post and to the OIE Breport (see ProMED archive (03) below), , ProMED Mod.TG posed a number of questions about the origin of the outbreak, which is why it was titled RFI "Request for information." Information on the strain involved is still awaited. - Mod.JW
