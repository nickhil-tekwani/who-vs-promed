Vet's death sparks fresh Hendra warning
---------------------------------------
Horse owners and veterinary professionals have been warned the Hendra
virus is likely to strike again, after it claimed the life of a
central Queensland vet yesterday [1 Sep 2009].

Queensland Health has revealed that the veterinarian died yesterday in
Brisbane's Princess Alexandra Hospital. It is believed he contracted
the virus while treating sick horses at a Cawarral property, east of
Rockhampton, early last month [August 2009].

He had quarantine equipment in his car at the time, but chose not to
wear it, believing a horse he inspected died from a snake bite. The
horse later tested positive to Hendra virus.

The 3 other staff from the property who were treated with an
anti-viral drug and spent time in a Brisbane hospital have returned
home.

Queensland Health says 7 people have contracted Hendra virus since
1994 and the veterinarian is the 4th person to die from the disease.

Dr Nigel Perkins, who led an independent review into the latest
outbreak of Hendra virus, has warned the virus is likely to strike
again. He says people need to educate themselves about the virus and
become better prepared.

"People working with horses need to ensure that they take some
protective measures to reduce their own risk of exposure," he said.
"There are things people can do also around how they manage their
horses and how they feed and water their horses to reduce the risk of
their horses being exposed."

The Queensland Horse Council (QHC) says members are devastated by the
veterinarian's death. QHC spokeswoman Dr Fiona Thompson says vets work
closely with horse owners and assist them in their hour of need. "We
are sincerely disturbed when they come to harm as a result of treating
our horses," Dr Thompson said.

She says horse owners in Queensland will support all efforts to find a
solution to the Hendra virus [disease].

The state's health minister Paul Lucas told Parliament he learned of
the veterinarian's death last night [1 Sep 2009]. "I extend my deepest
sympathies to his family," he said.

"In total 5 people with exposure to these horses have been under the
care of Queensland Health. This is a terrible tragedy for his family
who are being supported by staff at the Princess Alexandra Hospital."

Just over a year ago a Brisbane vet died from Hendra virus after
contracting the disease from an infected horse at the Redlands
Veterinary Clinic. The veterinarian, 33, was the 3rd person to die
from Hendra virus [infection]. He had spent 5 weeks in hospital before
his family made the decision to turn off his life support system.

5 horses at the Redlands clinic also died during the outbreak. The
owner of the Redlands Veterinary Clinic, Dr David Lovell, says the
recent death of the veterinarian from the illness is a tragedy. Dr
Lovell says the veterinarian's death has affected his own staff after
the death last August [2008] of their colleague from Brisbane. There
is no known cure for the virus, which has never been reported in
humans outside Queensland.

[Veterinarians are a high risk group when it comes to this disease. It
is indeed sad that a missed diagnosis cost this veterinarian his life.
Veterinarians are by nature a caring lot, and they tend to treat their
patients with care and respect, often believing that the personal
protective equipment may frighten the already sick/injured animal.
Fright can be equally dangerous given that the majority of these
delightful creatures are larger than we are and capable, even by
accident, of causing us great harm.

Hendra virus (formerly called equine morbillivirus) is a member of the
family _Paramyxoviridae_. The virus was first isolated in 1994 from
specimens obtained during an outbreak of respiratory and neurologic
disease in horses and humans in Hendra, a suburb of Brisbane, Australia.

In Australia, humans became ill after exposure to body fluids and
excretions of horses infected with Hendra virus. Generally clinical
signs in human are similar to those with the flu virus, but there may
also be progressive encephalitis.

The drug ribavirin has been shown to be effective against Hendra virus
in vitro, and indeed has been used in combination with some other
drugs in this outbreak. Whether it was the drug combination or the
anti-viral alone is impossible to say, but those treated in this
fashion are living. However, those that took the combination therapy
reported feeling quite bad.

Much remains unknown about this virus, and much research is needed.
However, generally BSL-4 laboratories are required to safely research
this virus. The researchers need protection from the object of their
study.
