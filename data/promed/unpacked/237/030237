"Pink eye" outbreak
-------------------
The Public Health Department has issued an advisory notice to prevent the
spread of an outbreak of "pink eye" disease in the Cayman Islands. Pink eye
or viral conjunctivitis is a highly infectious disease. Consultant
ophthalmologist Dr Jyotin Pandit said that conjunctivitis is caused by
adenoviruses. It is endemic in the Cayman Islands and can flare up
sporadically into an epidemic. "It seems that we may be entering such a
period, as the number of reported cases per week has increased
significantly above the norm," Dr Pandit said.

Infection can be passed on by droplet exposure, such as through coughs and
sneezes, and by direct contact with secretions such as tear fluid and mucus
discharge. Usually a work colleague or a family member may have had a
cough, cold, sore throat, or even diarrhoea and vomiting, as all of these
may be caused by the same virus.

Within 3 to 5 days of contact, one or both eyes of a newly infected
individual may become red, sore and gritty. There may be a mucus discharge
that makes the eyelids stick together in the morning. The eyelids may also
become swollen.

Frequently there may be mild non-tender swelling of the lymph glands in
front of the ear or underneath the jaw line. Typically the other eye
becomes involved as well, but not always. Occasionally there may be a
subconjunctival haemorrhage on the surface of the eye, which may appear
suddenly, causing anxiety. It is completely harmless and will disappear
over a few weeks. Very rarely, the surface of the eye (cornea) may also be
inflamed, causing some photophobia and glare.

According to Dr Pandit, the younger the person the quicker the recovery.
"Children typically improve within 3 to 4 days, but adults can be unwell
for up to 2 weeks. Usually the person is infectious for up to one week, so
children should stay away from school and adults should stay away from work
for one week. Personal items such as towels and toys should not be shared,
as they can transmit the infection," Dr Pandit said.

Fortunately the disease is self-limiting, meaning it gets better on its own
with time, the medical expert said. There is no treatment to cure the
disease but if something is desired for palliation, then [antiseptic] eye
drops 3 times a day to reduce the symptoms and redness [may be administered].

[Viral conjunctivitis occurs sporadically in all communities throughout the
world, whereas distinct epidemics are recorded more frequently in the East
and in tropical and semi-tropical regions, more often in the 2nd half of
the year. The factors contributing to the occurrence of these epidemics
(climatic or otherwise) are unknown. The etiology of viral conjunctivitis
has been discussed in previous posts (see references below). Epidemic
keratoconjunctivitis and epidemic hemorrhagic conjunctivitis are
self-limiting conditions that can be caused by several different viruses
including enterovirus 70, coxsackievirus A24, and human adenovirus types 8,
11, 19, and 37. Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis has been associated
particularly with adenovirus 11. The Cayman Islands outbreak is being
attributed to adenovirus infection, but this remains to be confirmed.
