Further to the posting cited above, we should like to correct the
impression that confusion reigns.
A consignment of serum samples (36 human, 1 calf) (from Kenya and Somalia)
was received at the National Institute for Virology (NIV), Johannesburg on
the evening of Tuesday, 30 December, 1997. Only small volumes of serum were
available in some instances and there had to be a degree of selectivity
about the tests to be performed. By the following morning, 31 December,
many of the viral hemorrhagic fevers had been eliminated on the basis of
negative results obtained in antigen and antibody detection tests, as the
posting of 1 January indicates, while 4/22 sera tested had been found
PCR-positive for Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus nucleic acid, and 17/36
positive for antibody to RVF virus by either indirect immunofluorescence
(IF) or IgG or IgM ELISAs. However, there were discrepancies in results
between the three serological techniques (which may have been due to
technical problems) and the proportion of seropositives was slightly lower
than expected relative to the ostensible days of illness on which samples
were collected.
The serological results are being checked, but a) it is often difficult to
fix dates of onset accurately in field outbreaks of this nature, and b)
since the stated interval between onset of illness and the sampling of
patients varied from 1 day to 7 months, it is possible that some non-cases
were included among those rated as cases.
By 1 January, 12 sera of which adequate volumes remained available had been
tested by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and 8/12 found positive for
antibody to RVF virus (with negatives occurring in stated non-cases). HAI
tests on these same 12 sera ruled out yellow fever, which had not been
included in the original panel of tests, and the same 12 sera were negative
for radio-immunoassay antibody to hepatitis E virus (many of the sera had a
jaundiced appearance). So, by 1 January the both PCR and HAI results were
suggestive of a diagnosis of RVF.
Anthrax had been one of the diseases under suspicion in the field and in
the original tests of 30-31 December there had been 3 reactors in an ELISA
for IgG antibody to anthrax antigen, and one slight reactor in an antigen
detection test, but the OD reading for the antigen detection reaction was
below cut-off value and the result was discarded. A bacillus had been
cultured from a human serum sample in Kenya, but it has since been found to
be non-lethal for mice, so it is unlikely to be anthrax (rats are
resistant, but mice are susceptible to anthrax). So it was concluded that
the 3 reactors may possibly have encountered anthrax antigen at some
previous time in their existence.
By Friday 2 January RVF virus had been isolated in cell cultures from 2 of
the PCR-positive sera - identification was confirmed by immunofluorescence
with monoclonal antibody. A further isolation from a PCR-positive serum
was confirmed on Monday 5 January, and it appears that there may be more
isolations to come - at least one more culture shows slight cytopathic
effect.
The signs of illness and lesions described in livestock by the veterinarian
in the posting of 1 January, Dr Louise Martin, fit the classical picture of
RVF - see relevant chapter in: Coetzer JAW Thomson GR Tustin RC 1994
Infectious Diseases of Livestock with Special Reference to Southern Africa.
Cape Town: Oxford Unversity Press. However, the lesions described on the
hands of some of those handling livestock tissues may be due to extraneous
infections (bacteria, orf virus etc).
A further consignment of serum samples was received at NIV on Monday 5
January, including goat sera, and these will be tested over the next few
days. Nevertheless, the available evidence supports the conclusion that
there has been a recent/current RVF epidemic in Kenya, and the serological
results so far suggests that the same has occurred in Somalia. There has
been a delay in getting specimens to the Special Pathogens Unit at the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, but their findings
should become available in due course.

[We are very grateful to Bob Swanepoel for these details. The [06 posting
had been cleared by Drs. Klaucke & Martin, who we are sure did not intend
to convey an impression of confusion. It was evident that livestock were
dying from multiple causes, and that RVF and anthrax were both still
possible etiologies for the human disease as of 1 Jan.1998.
Last week we had a full & detailed description of the laboratory studies on
human specimens but were asked not to post them without clearance from
Nairobi. Here at ProMED-mail one of our priorities, after providing
information on emerging disease outbreaks, is to help, not hinder, those in
the field. We submitted some 15+ case reports to Steve Berger, who ran them
through his diagnostic program GIDEON and declared them to be RVF. The
result was shared with Nairobi.
Not infrequently we are party to information that we cannot post for a
variety of serious reasons, including the personal safety of informants.
ProMED-mail is being under-utilised by the contributing members if we are
prevented from passing on information. - Mods. MHJ, JW
