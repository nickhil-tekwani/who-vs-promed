A total of 5 new cases of the deadly Ebola virus have been recorded in Guinea in the past 24 hours, the World Health Organization said on Wednesday [2 Apr 2014].

The total number of suspected and confirmed cases of one of the deadliest viruses known to man has risen to 127 in the country, with 83 people now known to have died, the UN's public health agency said.

No treatment or vaccine is available for the virus, and the UN agency said the fatality rate in Guinea so far stands at 65 percent, with the virus mainly hitting adults aged 15 to 59. The WHO said 35 cases had now been confirmed by laboratory testing.

In the capital Conakry, 12 people are known to have contracted the disease, 4 of whom have died.

The WHO is working with countries bordering Guinea to put in place "necessary disease surveillance measures," with both Liberia [and] Sierra Leone reporting suspected Ebola cases and deaths among people who travelled to Guinea before showing symptoms.

Liberia has confirmed 2 cases and suspects 5 more, while Sierra Leone is closely monitoring 15 people who attended a funeral in an area hit by the outbreak, the WHO said.

The Federal Ministry of Health said on Tuesday [1 Apr 2014] that laboratory investigation had shown that there was an outbreak of dengue haemorrhagic fever in Nigeria, and not ebolavirus as widely reported.

Speaking at a news conference in Abuja, the Minister of State for Health, Dr Khaliru Alhassan, said the alleged outbreak of ebolavirus in the country was false and misplaced.

"As a follow up of a report in a section of the media of an outbreak of ebolavirus in Nigeria, the Federal Ministry of Health wishes to inform the general public that laboratory investigation has revealed that it is not ebolavirus disease, but dengue haemorrhagic fever [DHF]. This has been reported wrongly. Dengue fever is caused by a virus, which is usually transmitted through a particular type of mosquito -- not the normal _Anopheles_ mosquito that we know transmits malaria -- but another kind of mosquito known as _Aedes albopictus_. Its (DHF's) symptoms are very similar to that of malaria; that is, you get fever, you get headache, you get body pains, and of course it may be associated with vomiting." Alhassan added that dengue fever could cause bleeding gums, bloody diarrhoea, nose bleeding, and severe pains in the eyes, as well as red palms and soles.

According to the minister of state, the activities of the mosquito that transmits the virus are being closely monitored nationwide by the Enugu-based Arbovirus Research Centre of the ministry.

Nigeria vaccine?
----------------
Mr. Labaran Maku, a cabinet minister speaking on very serious public health issues, was heard on AIT Live (Africa Independent Television) addressing the state house press after the weekly Federal Executive Council meeting, to say that Nigeria has a stock of vaccines to fight ebolavirus, should the dreaded killer disease appear on its shores.

[This cannot be true, or WHO would already have requested some of it for use in Guinea and Liberia to stop it from reaching Nigeria and other West African countries. It is good to try to alleviate panic, but not by using untrue statements. - Mod.JW]

As BioNews Texas Contributing Editor Charles Moore has recently reported, there are research efforts underway to help combat the virus, such as a USD 28 million NIH [US National Institutes of Health] award to develop new treatment options, as well as Corgenix Medical Corporation's recent move to extend its existing viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) rapid test kit development to include the ebolavirus for West Africa.

A University of Texas Medical Branch researcher says that underfunding and the few outbreaks of ebolavirus disease has left the medical community largely unprepared for a deadly ebolavirus outbreak such as this one. However, there may be one available option.

According to a news release from UTMB [University of Texas Medical Branch], Dr. Thomas Geisbert, a UTMB researcher with proven expertise in ebolavirus research, is currently working on a vaccine for the infection. VSV, which stands for vesicular stomatitis virus-based Ebola vaccine, has yet to be tested on humans. However, in the researcher's animal-based clinical trials, the VSV vaccine cured 100 percent of the animals infected with Ebola. Given the severity of the outbreak in Guinea and the fact that the shot has worked so conclusively well in animals should be enough for it to be used in human cases in West Africa where there is little hope otherwise for survival. "You have to reach a balance between advancing science, medical ethics and saving lives," Dr. Geisbert told Reuters. "It's not easy, but how many people faced with the prospect of near certain death would opt to take their chances with the virus?"

Dr. Geisbert's research into developing vaccines and treatment options for Ebola is well documented. He is currently leading his research effort in partnership with Profectus Biosciences, Tekmira Pharmaceuticals and the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, backed by a 5-year, USD 26 million grant. While his research and development for an Ebola vaccine has yet to be conducted through FDA-approved clinical trials in humans, the early-stage vaccine could be prescribed to patients in Guinea on "compassionate grounds" if the FDA [US Food and Drug Administration] and other governing public health bodies were to approve it.

[Vaccines generally do not work when given after exposure (the exception is rabies vaccine), but an ebolavirus vaccine could be given to people exposed by accompanying ill relatives to hospital, or involved in traditional burial rites.

There is a question as to how fast production of this vaccine could be ramped up to provide a stock of hundreds of doses.
