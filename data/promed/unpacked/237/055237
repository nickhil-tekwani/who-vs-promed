Regarding the major fish kill associated with _Flexibacter
columnaris_, I have seen 2 similar fish kills in the past (in
Australia) that were caused by epidemic _F. columnaris_ in the gills
and skin lesions.
Both were associated with warmer waters than usual), but the more important
factor appeared to be stirring up of the sediment caused by river flooding.
Warm water alone as a disease factor occurs commonly, but _F. columnaris_
epidemics are much rarer, and they seem to require an increase in turbidity
and particulate matter.
_F. columnaris_ is a sediment-associated bacterium, so any stirring
up of the sediment, as occurs with flood or storm, seems to lead to
much greater baseline exposure. This is followed by infection,
disease, and rapid horizontal spread, which amplifies the process.
In theory it should affect more than one species, but the degree of
tolerance seems to vary a lot between species, so it is often the
case that one species will succumb first to an environment-related
disease epidemic.

[Dr. Chadwick's experience with Columnaris, particularly with one
species, is most interesting and certainly may be helpful to the
investigators in Pennsylvania. - Mod.TG]
