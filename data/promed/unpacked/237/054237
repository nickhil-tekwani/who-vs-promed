Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of /Slaughtered
Swine / 807 / 5 / 0 / 0 / 0-

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Swine / 0.62 / 0 / 0 / **
* Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter
** Not calculated because of missing information

Epidemiology:
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Introduction of new live animals, contact with wild species.

["Aujeszky's disease, also known as pseudorabies, is caused by an alphaherpesvirus that infects the central nervous system and other organs, such as the respiratory tract, in a variety of mammals except humans and the tailless apes. It is associated primarily with suidae (pigs or wild boars), the natural host, which remain latently infected following clinical recovery (except piglets under 2 weeks of age, which die from encephalitis).

"A diagnosis of Aujeszky's disease is established by detecting the agent (by virus isolation or polymerase chain reaction [PCR]), as well as by detecting a serological response in the live animal.

"Aujeszky's disease is endemic in many parts of the world, but several countries have successfully completed eradication programmes, e.g. the USA, Canada, New Zealand and many member states of the European Union.

"The disease is controlled by containment of infected herds and by the use of vaccines or removal of latently infected animals. Stamping out has been or is used in several countries usually when the infected farms are small or when the threat to neighbouring farms is very high in free countries".
