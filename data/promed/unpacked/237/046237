South Africa may be entering a 5th COVID-19 wave earlier than expected after a sustained rise in infections over the past 14 days seemingly driven by the BA.4 and BA.5 omicron sub-variants, health officials and scientists have said.

The country, which has recorded the most coronavirus cases and deaths on the entire African continent, only exited a 4th wave at the beginning of this year [2022]. Authorities had predicted a 5th wave could begin in [May or June 2022], early in the southern hemisphere winter.

Health Minister Joe Phaahla told a press briefing on Friday [29 Apr 2022] that although hospitalisations were picking up, there had been no dramatic change in admissions to intensive care units or deaths so far.

He added that at this stage, health authorities had not been alerted to any new variant, other than changes to the dominant omicron variant that first emerged in South Africa and Botswana in November [2021], before sweeping around the world.

Since February [2022], cases had been dropping in South Africa, but infection numbers began increasing last week and have risen quickly since.

The country is now recording several thousand cases a day, up from a few hundred just a few weeks ago. The proportion of positive tests jumped from 4% in mid-April [2022] to 19% on Thursday [28 Apr 2022], according to official figures.

Wastewater surveillance has also shown increases in coronavirus spread.

Sub-variants may be more transmissible
--------------------------------------
Infectious disease specialist Richard Lessells told Friday's briefing [29 Apr 2022] that waning immunity from previous waves could be contributing to the earlier-than-expected resurgence in cases.

He said the rising share of infections attributed to the BA.4 and BA.5 sub-lineages of omicron suggested they had a growth advantage over other omicron sub-variants like BA.2.

But Wassila Jassat of the National Institute for Communicable Diseases said despite the soaring cases, there is no sign yet that BA.4 and BA.5 are causing significantly more severe disease.

Since the onset of the pandemic, South Africa has reported more than 3.7 million COVID-19 cases in total and recorded in excess of 100 000 deaths.

Although the country's 60 million people account for less than 5% of Africa's population of 1.3 billion, it has had more than a quarter of the continent's overall number of reported cases.

To date [29 Apr 2022], a 3rd of adults nationwide have been fully vaccinated, according to data compiled by the Reuters news agency.

Senior health official Nicholas Crisp also said on Friday [29 Apr 2022] that the country had enough vaccine doses and was not planning to procure more. He added the government was not intending to buy Pfizer's COVID-19 treatment pill Paxlovid for public sector patients, partly because it was very expensive.

On Thursday [28 Apr 2022], the WHO's Africa office flagged the current rise in South Africa's infection rate as the main driver of a more widespread uptick in cases on the African continent.

China's capital Beijing closed more gyms, malls, cinemas and apartment blocks on Friday [29 Apr 2022], with authorities ramping up contact tracing to contain a COVID-19 outbreak, while resentment at the draconian month-long lockdown in Shanghai continued to grow.

In the finance hub, fenced-in people in various districts have been protesting against the lockdown and difficulties in obtaining provisions by banging on pots and pans in the evenings, according to a Reuters news agency witness and residents.

A video shared on social media, whose authenticity could not be immediately verified, showed a woman warning people via a loud-hailer not to do so, saying such gestures were being encouraged by "outsiders".

The Shanghai government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Beijing's Chaoyang district, the 1st to undergo mass testing this week, started the last of 3 rounds of screening on Friday [29 Apr 2022] among its 3.5 million residents. Most other districts are due for their 3rd round of tests on Saturday [30 Apr 2022].

Chaoyang, accounting for the biggest share of cases in the capital's current outbreak, stepped up measures to curb transmissions as it declared more neighbourhoods to be at risk.

People who had recently visited venues in such areas have received text messages telling them to stay put until they get their test results.

"Hello citizens! You have recently visited the beef noodles & braised chicken shop in Guanghui Li community," one such text read. "Please report to your compound or hotel immediately, stay put and wait for the notification of nucleic acid testing."

"If you violate the above requirements and cause the epidemic situation to spread, you will bear legal responsibility."

At test sites, staffers with blue aprons urged people queueing to be tested to observe a 2-metre social distancing rule as loud-hailers reminded crowds to keep their masks on.

Additional apartment blocks were sealed and certain spas, KTV lounges, gyms, cinemas and libraries, and at least 2 shopping malls closed on Friday [29 Apr 2022], while couriers and food delivery staff were refused entry to some residential compounds.

Companies such as JD.com, an e-commerce platform, have been striving to keep residents well supplied.

The head of one of its logistics centres on the outskirts of Beijing, 32-year-old Ming Tang, said delivery volumes have increased by 65% since the 1st cases emerged on [22 Apr 2022], and 80% of the parcels are food-related.

"The effort of delivering parcels on time and long working hours put a lot of pressure on our couriers," he said.

Beijing reported 49 cases on [28 Apr 2022] versus 50 the previous day [27 Apr 2022].

Shanghai reported 52 new COVID-19 deaths on [28 Apr 2022], up from 47 a day earlier [27 Apr 2022], the local government said on Friday [29 Apr 2022]. It recorded 9545 new asymptomatic cases on [28 Apr 2022], versus 9330 a day earlier [27 Apr 2022], while symptomatic cases rose to 5487 from 1292.

While some delivery bottlenecks have been eased in the city, criticism of the government has continued to grow, particularly over the subject of government food provisions. Residents in some districts complain their rations have been less frequent than in others, taking to social media to compare deliveries.

The lockdown is driving scores of foreign residents to flee mainland China's most cosmopolitan city.

While no official statistics are available for departures in recent weeks, pet movers, property agents and law firms say they are seeing a sharp uptick in queries, while online groups swapping advice on how to leave have swelled.

"Until the lockdown I really couldn't feel the authoritarian government, because you're more or less free to do what you want and I never really lived oppressed," said Jennifer Li, a foreigner who is making plans for her family to leave the city that has been their home for 11 years.

[3] Viral dynamics

Study: SARS-CoV-2 virus shedding varied widely in the mildly ill
----------------------------------------------------------------
Daily infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus shedding varied substantially among 60 newly diagnosed asymptomatic or mildly ill COVID-19 patients early in the pandemic, suggesting that individual differences in viral dynamics may account for "superspreading," according to a first-of-its-kind modeling study published yesterday [28 Apr 2022] in Nature Microbiology. [Ke, R., Martinez, P.P., Smith, R.L. et al. Daily longitudinal sampling of SARS-CoV-2 infection reveals substantial heterogeneity in infectiousness. Nat Microbiol 7, 640-652 (2022). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-022-01105-z]

A superspreader transmits the virus to an exceptionally large number of other people. "Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by both presymptomatic and asymptomatic individuals has been a major contributor to the explosive spread of this virus," the researchers wrote.

Led by scientists from the Los Alamos National Laboratory and the University of Illinois, the study tracked daily SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in university staff and students' saliva and nose starting within 24 hours of diagnosis for up to 14 days early in the pandemic.

The team used rapid antigen COVID-19 tests, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, and viral culture to determine loads of live (infectious) SARS-CoV-2 and noninfectious viral RNA. The researchers used mathematical models to estimate viral replication and clearance rates and overall infectiousness for each participant. Participants had a median age of 28 years and were primarily White; none had been vaccinated against COVID-19, because vaccines weren't available at that time.

Viral dynamics may differ in superspreaders
-------------------------------------------
Some participants shed live SARS-CoV-2 for only a day or 2, while others did so for up to 9 days. "Based on that finding, we predict that those people who are shedding virus for more than a week are going to be a much greater risk of transmission than someone who only has live virus detectable for a day or 2," senior author Christopher Brooke, PhD, of the University of Illinois, said in a news release from the Carle Illinois College of Medicine. [https://medicine.illinois.edu/study-tracks-covid-19-infection-dynamics-in-adults/news]

Coauthor Pamela Martinez, PhD, also of the University of Illinois, said this finding is key. "People have observed that viral transmission is heterogenous, but most attribute those differences to individual behavior," she said in the release. "We assume that superspreaders are less cautious or are in contact with more people. This shows that intrinsic infection dynamics also play an important role."

Viral loads often peaked in saliva days before they did so in nasal swabs, which the researchers said indicates that saliva may be the better sample for early COVID-19 diagnosis. The alpha variant's viral loads and clearance dynamics didn't differ significantly from those of previous strains, which the study authors said suggests that higher viral loads or delayed clearance cannot alone explain alpha's higher transmissibility in relation to the wild-type virus.

When the researchers integrated the area under the infectious virus load curve over the course of disease to estimate infectiousness, they found a broad range of individual infectiousness, with a greater than 57-fold difference between the most and least infectious.

Findings may inform surveillance, control strategies
-----------------------------------------------------
There were no significant links between participants' symptoms and disease course, a finding that challenges the assumption that those who have more symptoms are always more infectious. But the authors cautioned against reading too much into that conclusion because all participants were asymptomatic or mildly ill, and none required treatment.

They said that previous studies on the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 shedding over time have been limited by low sampling frequency; failure to capture the early stages of infection, when viral spread is most likely; a lack of individual-level data on infectious virus shedding dynamics; and a bias toward the most severe clinical outcomes.

The researchers said that understanding the factors underlying the differences in individual viral transmission can inform the development of more targeted and effective infection-control methods.

"Viral infection is a highly complex process in which viral replication and shedding dynamics are shaped by the complex interplay between host and viral factors," they wrote. "In addition to implications for pathogenesis and transmission, defining the contours of viral shedding dynamics is also critical for designing effective surveillance, screening and testing strategies."

- The Americas region reported 22.5% of cases and 47.9% deaths during the past 24 hours. It has reported more than 152.92 million cases, second to the European region as the most severely affected region. The USA reported 86 804 cases in the last 24 hours, followed by Brazil, Canada, Honduras, Martinique, Puerto Rico, and Chile -- all reporting more than 1000 cases. Additionally, Trinidad & Tobago, Panama, Guatemala, and Peru reported more than 500 but fewer than 1000 cases in the last 24 hours. Argentina, Mexico, Ecuador, Costa Rica and Uruguay, among others, did not report cases over the last 24 hours.

- The European region reported 44.6% of cases and 28.8% of deaths over the last 24 hours. It is the most affected region with cumulative cases exceeding 214.63 million. Some countries reporting few or no cases in the last 24 hours or longer include Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Sweden and Tajikistan. A total of 17 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours, with 4 countries reporting more than 10 000 and 13 reporting over 1000 cases, while 9 other countries reported more than 500 but fewer than 1000 cases.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported no cases and deaths during the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 21.69 million cases. Overall, the reporting from the region has declined considerably over the last few days, whether this is attributable to reduced reporting on account of Ramadan and fasting, or an actual reduction, should become clear in the coming weeks.

- The African region reported 0.11% of daily cases and 1 death during the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 8.81 million cases. Mayotte (325) reported the highest number of cases over the last 24 hours. Most of the remaining (12 reporting) countries reported less than 50 or lower number of cases. A total of 38 countries did not report any cases over the last 24 hours.

- The Western Pacific region reported 29.7% of daily case numbers and 14.6% of deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 54.36 million cases. South Korea (50 568) reported the highest number of cases over the last 24 hours followed by Australia, Japan, China, New Zealand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore and Lao PDR.

- The South East Asia region reported 2.9% of the daily newly reported cases and 8.5% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 57.82 million cases.

[In the past 24 hours, 14 countries: Germany (96 523), the USA (82 291), Spain (62 695), Italy (59 395), France (52 919), South Korea (43 262), Japan (42 313), Australia (40 691), Belgium (20 335), Brazil (14 122), Canada (13 717), the UK (12 415), Thailand (12 888), and Taiwan (12 307) reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 2980 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 27 Apr 2022 to late 28 Apr 2022).

A total of 36 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 22 of the 36 countries are from the European region, 5 are from the Americas region, 1 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, 2 from the South East Asia region, and none from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 10.2%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 6.5%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 36.2% increase in daily reported cases and a 7.1% decrease in reported deaths. There is an overall global trend of decreasing cases with a slight upsurge in deaths (The US has shown an increasing case trend over the last few days) and reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 0.71 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 512.89 million cumulative reported cases and more than 6.25 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
