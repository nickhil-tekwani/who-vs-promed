Outbreaks of scrapie have been reported on 2 sheep farms. Authorities have also placed restrictions on farms in Bocsig commune, Arad County, which have a total of 750 sheep.

The disease was detected in several animals whose 1st tests were positive for scrapie. A 2nd set of samples is currently being processed, before a decision is made on the possible slaughter of the animals, according to aradon.ro.

The 1st animals had specific symptoms a few days ago, and the samples were sent to the Institute of Diagnosis and Animal Health (IDSA), Bucharest, as mentioned by the Director of the Veterinary and Food Safety Directorate of Arad, Marcel Roşu.

"The 1st test performed was positive, but in such cases a 2nd test is made, which is more sensitive, to confirm the disease. For the time being, the farms have been put under surveillance and restrictions, and if the final result confirms that the sheep have scrapie, IDSA will decide on the action plan to be implemented. It is possible to slaughter sheep even for consumption, but it can also be decided to kill and neutralize", said Marcel Roşu.

He explained that scrapie is a fatal degenerative disease that affects the central nervous system of sheep and goats. The disease is similar to mad cow disease [see comment].

Animal breeders may notice symptoms and suspect any animal that has had a nervous or behavioral disorder.

"Any living or slaughtered or dead animal showing a nervous or behavioral disorder or a progressive deterioration of the general condition associated with a deterioration of the central nervous system and for which the information gathered on the basis of clinical examination, response to treatment, examination post-mortem or ante-mortem or post-mortem laboratory tests do not allow the establishment of an alternative diagnosis", the IDSA guide states.

Sheep farms in Romania have been dealing with scrapie since 2002, when it was officially confirmed by the Institute of Diagnosis and Animal Health.

Scrapie is a neurodegenerative disease of sheep and goats, known for several centuries. It is characterised by the typical spongiform encephalopathy changes which have been observed also in other mammals, including cattle (BSE) and humans (CJD). The 'classic' scrapie is transmissible among sheep and goats but, contrary to classic BSE, is not known to infect humans. The more recently identified condition known as atypical scrapie has some clinical and pathological features similar to classical scrapie but it is not considered to be transmitted in field situations. In addition to the neurological signs mentioned in the media report, pruritus (itching), expressed by scratching of affected animals, may be observed. Clinical scrapie is mostly seen in adult (3-6 year old) sheep.

In 2020, scrapie cases were reported from 16 EU-member countries and the UK, led by Spain (256 cases, of which 244 were "classical" and 12 "atypical"), Greece (177, 176, 1), Italy (108, 102, 6) and Romania (53, 52, 1). For data from other European countries, see table 21 in "EFSA (European Food Safety Authority), 2021. The European Union summary report on surveillance for the presence of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) in 2020. EFSA Journal 2021;19(11):6934, 64 pp. https://doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2021.6934".

Romania is a live-sheep and mutton exporting country; its current sheep population exceeds 10 million. - Mod.AS
