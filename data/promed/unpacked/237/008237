Following a confirmed outbreak in French Polynesia, 2 cases of zika fever have been reported in New Caledonia.

Zika fever is a viral illness similar to dengue fever, yellow fever, and Japanese encephalitis; and is spread though mosquito bites.

The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention says the French Polynesian Department of Health has confirmed an outbreak of several hundred cases of zika fever in Tahiti and other islands of the group, including Bora Bora.

Travellers are being advised to use insect repellants, wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants, and sleep in screened rooms or under bed nets.

Symptoms of zika fever include high temperature, headache, red eyes, skin rash, muscle aches, and joint pains lasting up to a week.

Mosquitoes carrying the virus can bite day and night, both inside and out, and live around buildings in urban areas.

Zika fever originated in Uganda 65 years ago and largely remained in Africa and Asia until an outbreak on the island of Yap in the Federated States of Micronesia in April 2007, affecting more than 100 people.

[The Zika virus outbreak on French Polynesia islands continues, with infected individuals coming to New Caledonia. An additional report (in French) stated that the cases on New Caledonia were imported (http://nouvellecaledonie.la1ere.fr/2013/11/26/les-deux-premiers-cas-de-zika-en-nouvelle-caledonie-88451.html).

If these individuals were viremic on arrival, there is a significant risk of ongoing transmission. New Caledonia has had an outbreak of chikungunya virus infections this year (September 2013), and the mosquito vectors involved in that outbreak are competent vectors of Zika virus.

The islands in French Polynesia affected by the Zika virus outbreak this year (2013) are: Tahiti, Moorea, Raiatea, Tahaa, Bora Bora, Nuku Hiva, and Arutua. There was a major outbreak of Zika virus infections on Yap and nearby islands of the Federated Republic of Micronesia in 2007. The vector mosquito of this flavivirus virus was not reported. It would be interesting to know if the mosquito vectors of Zika virus in the outbreaks mentioned above have been determined.
