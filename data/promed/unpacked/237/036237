Chronic Disease of Infectious Etiology Revisited
-------------------------------------------------
Judging by the responses I received to a series of postings about chronic
diseases with suspected infectious causes, an argument could be made for an
idea whose time has come. Nearly simultaneously, The Atlantic Monthly,
February 1999, in an article by Judith Hooper, entitled "A New Germ
Theory," appeared. Also, in Natural History, February 1999, a series of
short articles appears on the ubiquity of microbes in the world and their
deep involvement in it. Implicit in the articles is the call to understand
the relationships more fully between humans and microbes.
Many ProMED-mail readers suggested additional chronic diseases or
conditions be worthy of mention. One reader suggested that immunizations
given to individuals with mild or low-grade infections might serve to
trigger additional activity on the part of the organism producing the
low-grade infection.
Crohn's disease and infection
-----------------------------
In regards to Crohn's disease, a writer informed me of a group of
researchers in England at the Royal Free Hospital in London that has
described measles virus in granulomas involving small mesenteric veins.
Additional research shows some ambiguities, but ambiguity is something of
the signature of a chronic disease with a suspected infectious etiology.
Another reader asked me about treatments for Crohn's disease, especially in
light of the strongly suspected bacterial etiology. I referred the reader
to a pair of internet sites which I had gleaned from previous postings on
ProMED-mail. [It is interesting that people sometimes assume that writers
are the repository of all information on the topic. I attempted to absolve
myself of that burden early in my composition of this series.
Asthma, other chronic diseases and infection
---------------------------------------------
I was asked by another reader to consider asthma as a chronic disease with
a possible infectious cause. For the most part, asthma has been linked to
exogenous environmental agents, but usually of an allergenic nature rather
than infectious. I am unaware of any research into the infectious nature,
if any, of asthma.
Additional chronic diseases suggested as candidates with infectious
etiologies were, Kaposi's Sarcoma & its associated herpesvirus [EBV,
Epstein-Barr virus, Multiple Sclerosis and Varicella-Zoster virus, Sudden
Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) [not exactly chronic, Chronic Fatigue
Syndrome (twice, one with a toxic etiology and another with an infectious
etiology), bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and Creutzfeldt-Jakob
Disease (CJD).
Cancer and SV40
------------------
Dorothy Preslar, Director of ProMED-AHEAD, in response to the post on
viruses and cancer, sent me a report from Newsday, December 29, 1998,
entitled "A New Cancer Risk? Monkey Virus Found in Polio Vaccination
Implicated in Study." Briefly, monkey kidney cells were used to culture
polio virus for use in vaccines from 1955-1963. [Though the article does
not say so, the vaccine referred to here is the live attenuated Sabin
vaccine - Mod.JW Use of these rhesus monkeys was halted when simian virus
number 40 (hence the name SV40) was found in the monkeys providing the
kidneys. By that time 98 million Americans had received the vaccine
prepared from them. Government officials have persisted in saying that
little or no risk is involved from having received the vaccine. But a type
of lung cancer, called mesothelioma, previously attributed to asbestos
exposure, is now being attributed to SV40 acquired in the polio vaccine.
This has the classic signs of an emerging disease: the unnatural
introduction of a virus into a host via iatrogenic means (an injection).
Hepatitis and Chlamydia
------------------------
Regarding Chlamydia, a reader informed me that _Chlamydia psittaci_ has
been linked in some cases of psittacosis to hepatitis. This reader stated
that 95% of psittacines (parrot-like and parakeet-like birds) are positive
for _C. psittaci_, which then raises the question, is there more hepatitis
in humans attributable to _C. psittaci_ than is being diagnosed?
Obesity and adenovirus
------------------------
Dr. Nikhil Dhurandhar, one of the primary investigators into the link
between obesity and an adenovirus, wrote back with some additional comments:
"Chickens and mice experimentally infected with the human adenovirus Ad-36
develop obesity and paradoxically, reduce serum cholesterol and
triglycerides. Approximately 70% of the animals inoculated with the virus
develop this syndrome.
"About 30% of the obese humans but only 4% of the non-obese subjects carry
neutralizing antibodies to Ad-36. Among the obese, antibody positive
subjects have significantly lower serum cholesterol and triglycerides
compared to the antibody negative obese subjects.
"Ad-36 causes obesity in animals and is strongly associated with human
obesity. We are currently working in several directions based on these
basic findings."
Koch's postulates and chronic disease
--------------------------------------
Koch's postulates and the conclusion of the series elicited several
comments by readers. Some shared extensive comments and even publications
on the subject of Koch's postulates and the nature of disease. Another
article by Relman addresses directly the issue of Koch's postulates:
Fredericks, D. N., and D. A. Relman. 1996. Sequence-based identification of
microbial pathogens: A reconsideration of Koch's postulates. Clin Microbiol
Rev. 9:18-33.
Some particularly cogent remarks follow:
"In essence using Koch's postulates from the 1880s ... to [approach
problems in the 1990s is precisely analogous to using Freudian techniques
to treat people for psychological problems today. Koch's postulates can't
take into consideration problems like carriage, obligate cell growth,
hit-and-run pathogenesis, and so forth."
"Overall, I find an enormous resistance among the scientific community to
the infectious etiology of some types of chronic diseases. I wonder how
many good ideas get "nipped in the bud" due to these unreasonably
super-high standards expected of projects in this area."
"Re your comments on Koch's postulates (and other scientific practices that
celebrate simplicity): I recently goaded a colleague (an HIV
epidemiologist) by suggesting that the net effects of Occam's razor on
clinical medicine may turn out to be negative. I have in mind the possible
impediments and delays imposed by insisting on giving priority of testing
(and funding) to oversimplified hypotheses, before more complex hypotheses
can be evaluated. I am now slowly ("off duty") doing my homework (reviewing
research literature) to find out whether I can really defend such a
willfully provocative assertion."
Comment
----------
In reading the comments and articles graciously shared with me, [one can
see there are alternative ways in which to approach disease mechanisms.
Koch's postulates are but one way. It would be naive for the
microbiological research community to assume that there will or should be
one way to approach chronic infectious diseases. The nature of acute
disease allowed for the development of "rules" or "postulates." The nature
of chronic disease is likely that there are no rules. What this means is
that there are likely to be many models, paradigms for chronic diseases,
each of which enhances our understanding of particular diseases, but none
of which is applicable to each and every chronic disease.
As for the chronic diseases not covered in this series, consider them
omissions of ignorance. [In line with the mission of ProMED-mail, chronic
diseases with suspected infectious etiologies may fall under the definition
of emerging diseases and therefore be worthy to report. They share certain
elements with the "classical" emerging diseases.
Finally, all respondents to my series were most gracious and applauding.
For that, I am most thankful to you. However, the real champions of this
work are the primary investigators and their teams. It was a relatively
easy task for me to compile the information. The researchers are the ones
hammering out the stories of low-level microbial activity in the middle of
all the other cellular activity going on. My hope is that this series has
called attention to their work.
