A New York City dialysis center was shut down by the state Health
department after one patient tested positive for hepatitis C. Now,
nearly 700 patients of the Life Care Dialysis Center in Manhattan are
being urged to get tested for both hepatitis B and C strains
[viruses], as well as HIV, according to a CBS TV report.

In a press release, the Health Department said they uncovered poor
conditions, including "blood on the treatment chairs and dialysis
machines, lack of proper hand hygiene, and inadequate disinfection of
equipment."

Hepatitis C is a chronic infectious disease of the liver that is most
commonly transmitted by needle-sharing during intravenous drug use,
according to the National Institutes of Health. Worldwide, an
estimated 180 million people have chronic hepatitis C, with more than
4 million of these cases in the United States, the NIH said on its website.

Officials say anyone treated at the center between 23 Jan 2004 and
the present should contact their physicians and get tested, the CBS
news station reported.

[Hepatitis C is a liver disease caused by hepatitis C virus (HCV).
HCV infection sometimes results in an acute illness, but most often
becomes a chronic condition that can lead to cirrhosis of the liver
and hepatic cancer. Contact with the blood of an infected person,
often through sharing contaminated needles to inject drugs, is the
primary route of transmission. There is no vaccine, but some forms of
hepatitis C respond to treatment with interferon and ribavirin.

Hepatitis C virus infection is a recurrent hazard in all medical
operations involving the transmission of blood and administration of
blood-derived products. Previous incidents (see ProMED-mail
references below) have involved hepatitis C virus contamination of
whole blood, various blood products, radioactive isotopes and medical
equipment. Nosocomial transmission occurs rarely. In the current
incident, the source of the contamination has not been identified,
but there appears to have been negligence in handling blood products
and a poor overall standard of hygiene and patient care. The recall
of patients treated as far back as 2004 is indicative of a systemic
problem in this particular unit. - Mod.CP]
