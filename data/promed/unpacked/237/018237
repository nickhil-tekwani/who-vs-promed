The Equine Disease Communication Center reported on 8 Apr 2019 that 4 quarter horses from Polk County, Iowa have tested positive for equine infectious anemia (EIA).

Equine infectious anemia is a viral disease that attacks horses' immune systems. The virus is transmitted through the exchange of body fluids from an infected to an uninfected animal, often by blood-feeding insects such as horseflies. It can also be transmitted through the use of blood-contaminated instruments or needles.

A Coggins test screens horses' blood for antibodies indicative of the presence of the EIA virus. Most U.S. states require horses to have proof of a negative Coggins test in order to travel.

Once an animal is infected with EIA, it is infected for life and can be a reservoir for the spread of disease.

Not all horses show signs of disease, but those that do can exhibit:

Progressive condition loss;
Muscle weakness;
Poor stamina;
Fever;
Depression; and
Anemia.

There is no vaccine and no cure. A horse diagnosed with EIA dies, is euthanized, or must be placed under extremely strict quarantine conditions (at least 200 yards away from unaffected equids) for the rest of its life.

On 8 Apr 2019 the Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported that the Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) has confirmed cases of equine infectious anemia (EIA) in Smith and Van Zandt counties.

Each animal's home premises "will remain under quarantine until requirements for release have been met," the EDCC said. "TAHC staff is working closely with owners and veterinarians to monitor potentially exposed horses and implement biosecurity measures."

[Owners and caretakers should be using horse-specific fly/mosquito repellant. While this does not do a perfect job of keeping the blood sucking insects such as tabanid flies (horseflies) off the animals, it may help.

This is another wicked and unforgiving disease. Our sympathy to those affected. - Mod.TG
