In the space of 2 years, chikungunya has gone from being a disease
known principally to medical specialists to becoming a much-dreaded
pestilence that, even if it doesn't kill, leaves sufferers often
enduring months of crippling pain. [Recent reports have implicated
chikungunya virus infection in occasional deaths (see ProMED-mail
posting 20061014.2953). - Mod.TY]

Starting in early 2005, this disease, which is caused by a virus
spread by mosquitoes, swept through the islands of Comoros, Mayotte,
Seychelles, Reunion, and Mauritius that lie in the south-western
Indian Ocean, not far from the coast of Africa. The epidemic
continued into 2006.

From late 2005 onwards, hospitals in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and
Maharashtra found themselves swamped with patients complaining of
fever and joint pain, which turned out to be chikungunya. Large
numbers of people fell victim to the virus in these states during
2006, and the disease spread to other parts of the country as well.
The statistics on the website of the Union Government's National
Vector-Borne Disease Control Programme show that some 1.4 million
people in the country may have contracted the disease in 2006.

From Kerala to Italy
--------------------
Kerala continued to reel from the disease this year [2007] as well,
and cases of chikungunya have been reported from West Bengal and
Orissa too. A few months ago, Italy discovered, to its alarm, that a
returning resident, who picked up the infection in Kerala, set off a
chain of transmission with local mosquitoes in 2 neighbouring
villages in the north-east of the country. There are now fears that
viral transmission could resume when mosquito numbers increase again
in the spring of 2008. As a result, chikungunya might spread further
in Italy and perhaps to other parts of Europe as well.

Chikungunya is believed to have originated in Africa where
forest-dwelling mosquitoes circulate the virus among wild non-human
primates. "In South Africa, chikungunya is transmitted between
African grey vervet monkeys and also between baboons by mosquitoes
belonging to the _Aedes furcifer/cordellieri_ complex," according to
Peter Jupp, a medical entomologist formerly with the country's
National Institute for Virology (NIV) and National Institute of
Communicable Diseases. "The same mosquitoes feed on man and infect
him when he is present in the same areas where the monkey-mosquito
cycle is occurring," he told this correspondent in an e-mail.
However, the virus was not thought to be endemic in South Africa
itself, but could be entering the country from neighbouring Zimbabwe
and Mozambique, he added.

The chikungunya virus was first isolated from the blood serum of a
patient during a dengue-like epidemic that broke out in Tanzania in
1953. Since then, many outbreaks of the disease have been documented
in Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia.

In India, the 1st recorded outbreak happened in Kolkata in 1963,
followed by epidemics along the east coast and elsewhere during 1964
and 1965. Nearly 4 lakh [400 000] cases were reported in Chennai
alone in 1964. Then there was an outbreak in the small town of Barsi
in Maharashtra in 1973.

"After that [the Barsi outbreak], there was silence," remarked Vidya
Arankalle, senior deputy director of the NIV in Pune, in the course
of a talk she gave during the recent annual meeting of the Indian
Academy of Sciences in Thiruvananthapuram. In view of the long
absence of chikungunya epidemics, it was postulated that the virus
had disappeared from India and Southeast Asia, she observed in a
paper published along [with] her colleagues in the Journal of General
Virology earlier this year [2007].

The virus then re-emerged with a bang. "The scope of the 2005-2007
outbreaks is certainly of unprecedented magnitude," noted Ann Powers
and Christopher Logue of the Division of Vector-Borne Infectious
Diseases of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
in a review paper published this year [2007].

Using the latest tools at their disposal, including the ability to
sequence and scrutinise the viral genes, scientists are trying to
understand how the strain that set off the 2005-2007 outbreaks might
have emerged and what makes this virus so virulent.

Based on their genetic similarities, chikungunya viral strains fall
into 3 groups. 2 of these groups are primarily Africa-based: the
strains of the West African type form one cluster while those from
East, Central, and South Africa (ECSA) form a separate one. The 3rd
group comprises of strains found in Asia.

A team of French scientists sequenced almost the entire genome of 6
viral samples and partially sequenced a single gene of another 127
viral samples from the Indian Ocean island outbreaks. The study
published last year [2006] by Isabelle Shuffenecker and fellow
scientists at the Institut Pasteur in France in collaboration with
clinicians and virologists showed that the same strain had caused
those outbreaks and that it belonged to the ECSA grouping.

"Although, to our knowledge, no outbreak was reported recently in
East Africa, this scenario is compatible with the human population
exchanges between East Africa and Comoros [Island], where the
outbreak is believed to have started," observed the scientists in
their PLoS [Public Library of Science] Medicine paper. But the
possibility of the epidemic strain having been produced by the
evolution of a hitherto animal virus could not be excluded, they
added.

When NIV scientists sequenced viruses involved in outbreaks in 5
Indian States during 2006, they discovered that these too belonged to
the ECSA group. Hitherto, the viral strains that caused previous
outbreaks of chikungunya in the country had been of the Asian type.
Moreover, the 99.9 percent genome sequence similarity between the
strains found in the Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean and in India
"implies circulation of the same strains in both countries,"
concluded the NIV scientists in their journal paper. "It also
indicates a possibility of spread of the current strain from Indian
Ocean islands to India, leading to an explosive epidemic of the ECSA
genotype and not the Asian genotype that circulated earlier," they
added.

But there is another possible origin for the epidemic strain. In
2000, the chikungunya virus had been isolated from a mosquito found
in the town of Yawat in Maharashtra, although no cases were reported
among humans at the time. "This strain has suddenly become very
important for us," remarked Dr Arankalle in her talk at
Thiruvananthapuram. When the genome of this virus was sequenced, it
too was found to belong to the ECSA group and not the Asian variety.
"That means we had the African genotype in India before ... the
epidemic came in 2005," she pointed out.

So might the Yawat strain have continued to circulate quietly in
India since 2000, accumulating mutations till finally it turned into
a form that spread with devastating rapidity and virulence among
humans?

NIV scientists have been re-analysing their samples going back to
2001, taken from patients with dengue-like symptoms but who tested
negative for dengue. They found that sporadic cases of chikungunya
had indeed occurred in India between 2001 and 2004. "Right now what
we are trying to do is to get [the] virus out of these cases," said
Dr Arankalle in Thiruvananthapuram. "If we can get [the] virus from
one of these cases, then we will be able to sort out as to why the
Yawat virus did not produce the disease and what happened
subsequently till 2005 when we had such a bad epidemic."

However, in a brief piece published in the New England Journal of
Medicine this year [2007], Sylvain Brisse, Isabelle Iteman, and Dr
Schuffenecker of the Institut Pasteur took the view that the strain
that caused the outbreak in India was not the same as the one
responsible for the disease on the Indian Ocean islands. Their
analysis was based on comparing the genetic sequences among different
strains for the viral gene that codes for one particular protein
(E1). They also argued against "a direct link" between the Yawat
strain and the strain implicated in the 2005-2006 Indian outbreak.
But the fact that the Indian and Indian Ocean isolates shared 2
changes in their E1 gene sequence indicated a common ancestry for
both, they stated.

Twist in the tale
-----------------
There is, however, a further twist in the tale. E. Sreekumar and his
team at the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology in
Thiruvananthapuram have been examining viral samples from chikungunya
cases in Kerala during 2006 and 2007. They found that the E1 gene
sequence of 4 viral samples from Kerala this year [2007] showed an
extraordinary level of resemblance to that of the Reunion Island
strain. One possibility was that the virus circulating in the State
had mutated, observed Dr Sreekumar. The alternative explanation would
be that a strain that originated in the Indian Ocean islands had a
hand in this year's epidemic in the State. "We need to do more
analysis to answer that question," he told The Hindu.
