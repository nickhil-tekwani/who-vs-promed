State Records First Human Rabies Case in 25 Years
-------------------------------------------------
Minnesota's first case of human rabies since 1975 has been diagnosed in a
47-year-old Becker County man who died yesterday in a Fargo, N.D.,
hospital.
Officials at the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) believe the man was
probably infected with the rabies virus when he was bitten by a bat,
sometime between 20 Sep 2000 and 28 Sep 2000.
The man did not seek appropriate medical attention until it was too late
to receive preventive treatment for rabies, officials said. He did see a
physician on 14 Oct 2000, but the doctors who treated him were not informed
about the bat bite until after he was hospitalized on 19 Oct 2000.
His illness was confirmed as rabies yesterday, based on testing done by
the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta.
The case underscores the importance of seeking prompt medical attention
if you are bitten by an animal that could be infected with rabies,
according to MDH officials.
Rabies can be prevented following exposure to a rabid animal if treatment
is started before symptoms of the illness appear. Once a person develops
symptoms of rabies, the illness is always fatal.
Rabies is rare in humans. Only 3 cases were reported in Minnesota during
the past century. In addition to the 1975 case, human rabies cases were
reported in 1917 and 1964. The Minnesota case was the fourth to be reported
this year in the U.S., following reports of cases in California, Georgia
and New York State. A little over 3 dozen
cases have been reported nationwide since 1980. Of those individuals who
were infected in this country, most had strains of the virus typically
found in bats.
Humans usually become infected with rabies as the result of being bitten
by a skunk, a bat, or some other animal. Two of the other 3 cases
reported this year in the U.S. were caused by virus strains that are
found in bats. Although skunks and bats are the main source of the rabies
virus in Minnesota, dogs, cats and cattle are also among the animal
species most frequently diagnosed with rabies.
Transmission of the virus from one person to another is not considered to
be a significant risk.
People should seek medical attention any time they have been in a
situation where they could have been infected by a rabid bat. That
includes cases where they may have been sleeping while a bat was in the
room, and could have been bitten or scratched without knowing it. The
possibility of an unnoticed bite or scratch is a special concern in the
case of children, the mentally disabled, or individuals who were under
the influence of alcohol or drugs.
Although it's considered rare, you can also be infected if you get
saliva or brain tissue from an infected animal in your eyes, nose or
mouth, or in an open wound.
People who may have been exposed to the rabies virus are given a shot of
rabies immune globulin, and 5 doses of rabies vaccine, given over a
one-month period. Treatment is unnecessary if the suspect animal can be
captured, tested, and found to be free of the virus. In the case of dogs,
cats or ferrets, treatment can often be avoided if the animal is held for
observation, and remains free of symptoms.
Those who may be apprehensive about getting rabies shots should be aware
that the vaccine is no longer given through a series of painful shots in
the abdomen. The current vaccine is administered through a shot in the
arm.
MDH is also reminding people that they should get their household pets
immunized against rabies, MDH officials said. Rabies shots are available
for dogs, cats and ferrets.
People with concerns about possible exposure to rabies, or questions
about the disease, can call MDH at during normal business hours.
