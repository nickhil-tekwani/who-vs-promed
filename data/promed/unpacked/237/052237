Four horses have now been put down in an outbreak of equine herpes virus (EHV). 2 more have shown signs of the disease, and are "undergoing supportive care" in a vet hospital's isolation unit, while another 2 have shown respiratory signs but appear to be recovering. Vets believe the disease is currently contained within one livery yard, on the border of north Hertfordshire and south Bedfordshire.

"Understandably there is considerable concern amongst horse owners," said a statement from Rossdales veterinary practice. "The yard owner and all the liveries, who have been devastated by this unforeseen event, have been careful to follow our guidance with regard to biosecurity. The yard has remained closed and in quarantine since the confirmed diagnosis (8 hours after the 1st signs were reported). Sadly 4 horses have now been euthanised due the neurological presentation of EHV and our thoughts are with their owners at this difficult time."

Rossdales urged owners to be vigilant. "This outbreak serves to remind us only too clearly of the threat of disease and the possible consequences," the practice added. "Sensible biosecurity precautions at shows and training clinics should always be followed. Do not let your horse have unnecessary contact with others, do not share water buckets and do not graze away from home."

The practice said there is currently no need for owners to cancel plans to compete, but Stevenage and District Riding Club cancelled a dressage show due to run yesterday [6 Nov 2016], as it felt it was "no longer responsible to run it". "Thank you for your understanding. Our thoughts are with all those who are affected by this outbreak, and we urge everyone else to stay safe," a statement from the club said.

Under Horserace Betting Levy Board rules, any yard at which there is an EHV outbreak must remain closed for 28 days from the date the last case was identified.

[Equine herpesvirus is a common virus that occurs in horse populations worldwide. The 2 commonest types are EHV-1, which is assumed to be the pathogen behind the event above, which causes respiratory disease in young horses, abortion in pregnant mares, and paralysis in horses of all ages and types, and EHV-4, which usually only causes low-grade respiratory disease but can occasionally cause abortion. Following 1st infection the majority of horses carry the virus as a latent (silent) infection that can reactivate at intervals throughout life.

EHV abortion can occur from 2 weeks to several months following infection with the virus, reflecting either recent infection or recrudescence (reactivation) of latent infection in a carrier horse. Abortion usually occurs in late pregnancy (from 8 months onwards) but can happen as early as 4 months. Respiratory disease caused by EHV is commonest in weaned foals and yearlings, often in autumn and winter. However, older horses can succumb and are more likely than younger ones to transmit the virus without showing clinical signs of infection. It is the continual cycling of EHV respiratory disease in young horses and the periodic reactivation of latent EHV in older horses that maintains the risk of EHV abortion in pregnant mares and EHV neurological disease in horses of all types and ages. Although EHV-1 may cause outbreaks of abortion, particularly in non-vaccinated mares, EHV-4 has only been associated with single incidents and is not considered a risk for contagious abortions.

Occasionally, EHV-1 can cause paralysis, which ranges in severity from a mild incoordination of the hindlimbs to quadriplegia (total paralysis where the horse is unable to stand). The most important risk factors for this form of disease include animals greater than 5 years of age, season (autumn, winter, and spring when animals are more likely to be stabled or UV light levels are low) and perhaps the strain of virus involved. However, although so-called 'neurological' strains have been identified, paralytic signs are seen with both these and 'non-neurological' strains, so this differentiation cannot be relied upon. Therefore, characterising EHV-1 on the basis of the 'neurological' strain marker is not considered useful and control measures should be adopted consistently irrespective of the strain of EHV- 1 involved. Clinically, the onset of paralysis may be sudden, with no prior clinical signs of respiratory disease and usually occurs in the 2nd week following infection.

There are no legal notification requirements for EHV in the UK, although it is recommended that owners inform their national breeders' association if EHV abortion or neurological diseases occur. In the UK, thoroughbred breeders should notify the Thoroughbred Breeders' Association and non-thoroughbred breeders their relevant breed association.

Because the infection may spread easily between horses and can have severe consequences, it is very important to quickly alert owners of horses that might be at risk of infection through contact with infected horse(s) or premises.

EHV respiratory disease is, to a certain extent, endemic among the horse population in the UK. Total freedom from disease can never be confirmed and vigilance is therefore important in the management of breeding stock, particularly pregnant mares, in order to minimize cases of EHV abortion, stillbirth, newborn foal death, and paralysis.

The above and additional updated information on equine EHV in the UK, including vaccination, is available in the "Code of practice for equine herpesvirus" issued by UK's Horserace Betting Levy Board at http://codes.hblb.org.uk/downloads/ehv_2016.pdf.

EHV-1 is listed by the OIE among the equine diseases under the title "Infection with equid herpesvirus-1 (equine rhinopneumonitis)". For the relevant export requirements, please see chapter 12.8 of OIE's Terrestrial Code, at http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_equine_rhinopneumonitis.htm.

EHV-1 is not notifiable by law in the UK. Consequently, no detailed statistics on its occurrence are available; during the years 2014, 2015, and the 1st 6 months of 2016, the disease was "present" (+) in the UK according to its annual and semiannual reports to the OIE. - Mod.AS
