Cyclosporiasis in Germany
-------------------------------
In Germany, cyclospora infections have been observed only sporadically as
the cause of diarrhoea in people returning from travel abroad. The
following report from Germany's national surveillance bulletin is a
reminder that contaminated foods also have to be taken into consideration
as vehicles for _Cyclospora cayetanensis_ (1). Over Christmas 2000 in
Germany's southernmost state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, at least 26 people
became ill after eating at a restaurant. Cases with diarrhoea were reported
to the municipal health authorities after attendance at 4 separate
Christmas parties at the same venue. Examination of stool specimens for
salmonella, shigella, yersinia, campylobacter, adenovirus, rotavirus, and
parasites (cryptosporidia and giardia) were negative. By 18 Jan 2001
further cases had been reported, and some patients were referred to the
outpatient department of a hospital for tropical diseases, where oocysts of
_C. cayetanensis_ were found in some stool specimens.
All 40 people who attended the 4 parties concerned received a standardised
questionnaire and were asked about foods consumed and the nature and
duration of any illness suffered. A total of 30 questionnaires (75%) were
returned to the health authorities, from 18 women and 12 men aged 22 to 65
years (median 41 years).
Of the 30 responders, 26 reported symptoms occurring after the party they
attended. The most frequently reported symptom was diarrhoea (24 cases),
followed by nausea (22), constipation (21), stomach cramps (19), vomiting
(10), and fever (9). Stool specimens were taken from 18 patients, and
_Cyclospora cayetanensis_ oocysts were found in 8 specimens. The onset of
illness ranged between 18 and 27 Dec 2000 for the participants at the first
party; for the following 3 parties between 19 and 25 Dec 2000. The
incubation period ranged from 5 to 14 days after exposure.
The symptoms lasted between 15 and 42 days (median 30) and had not receded
in 7 patients at the time of questioning. Among the 30 responders, 23
sought a physician's advice; the same number reported a weight loss of
between 2 kg and 9 kg (median 4 kg); 11 patients (42%) were unable to work
for 2-24 days (median 5). All guests ordered their food from a menu that
included more than 20 dishes. No association could be found between
consumption of particular foods and illness. Salads (mixed, whole leaf)
inclusive of fresh herbs (dill, chives, parsley, and chervil) were the only
foods eaten by all cases. None of the 3 people who had not eaten salad
became ill. No food specimens were available for testing.
On the basis of the epidemiological data collected it was assumed that the
source of infection was the salad, and its origins were traced. The whole
leaf salad had been sourced from a regional nursery via wholesalers in
France, and the mixed salad had been purchased from a wholesaler in the
Italian province of Bari.

[Anecdotal evidence suggests that sporadic cases of infection with
_Cyclospora cayetanensis_ are seen in Europe. This is the first larger
outbreak reported from Europe, and the data suggest that the source of
infection should be found inside Europe. Infection with _Cyclospora_ is
confirmed if stools are investigated with the modified Ziehl-Neelsen
staining used for identification of _Cryptosporidia_. - Mod.EP
