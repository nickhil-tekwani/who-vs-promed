CDC reports more allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines, but cases remain few
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Health officials reported Wednesday [6 Jan 2021] that 29 people in the United States have developed anaphylaxis after being vaccinated against COVID-19 since the vaccine rollout began, with cases occurring after vaccination using both the Pfizer-BioNTech and the Moderna vaccines.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said at present it looks like anaphylaxis cases are occurring at a rate of about 5.5 per 1 million vaccine doses given, though the agency cautioned that figure may change as the vaccination effort continues.

The allergic reactions do not change CDC's recommendations on who can be vaccinated against COVID-19, with senior officials stressing that the risk of severe illness and death from the disease still outweighs the risk of developing anaphylaxis after vaccination.

"Of course, we all would hope that any vaccine would have zero adverse events. But even at 11 cases per million doses administered, it's a very safe vaccine," said Nancy Messonnier, director of CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. "We're in the setting of 2000 COVID deaths per day. ... I would say it's still a good value proposition for someone to get vaccinated."

Messonnier made her remarks during a press briefing held to explain data in an early assessment of the anaphylaxis cases by CDC scientists. In the article, published Wednesday in CDC's online journal Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, the researchers evaluated 21 cases of anaphylaxis that occurred in the 1st week and a half of the vaccination rollout. At that point, 1.9 million people had been vaccinated, for a rate of 11.1 cases of anaphylaxis per 1 million doses of vaccine used.

The period studied ran from the beginning of the national vaccination campaign to [23 Dec 2020], just 2 days after the Moderna vaccine began to be used. To date, most of the cases have occurred after receipt of the Pfizer vaccine, but whether that's because more of that vaccine has been used is not yet clear. Both vaccines are made using messenger RNA.

Anaphylaxis is a known but rare side effect of vaccination, though the rate at which it occurs following COVID-19 vaccination appears to be higher than it is for some vaccines, such as flu shots. If left untreated, the reaction can be fatal in some cases, though none of the people whose cases were disclosed Wednesday died.

Most of the people who developed the reaction were treated with epinephrine, the drug that is in the EpiPens carried by people who have severe allergies.

The CDC recommends that anyone who had an anaphylactic reaction to the 1st dose of a COVID vaccine should not have the 2nd dose.

Messonnier said there are "tremendous efforts" underway to try to understand why these vaccines are triggering severe reactions in some people. Most, though not all, of the people who developed anaphylaxis had a history of allergies to a variety of things -- nuts, shellfish, some drugs, and wasps -- and several had previously experienced anaphylaxis. Most also developed the reaction within 15 minutes of having been vaccinated.

The CDC did not give a breakdown of how many cases occurred overall with the Pfizer vaccine vs. the one developed by Moderna.

"At this point, we think that it is something that is seen with both vaccines and therefore our recommendations apply to both vaccines," Messonnier said.

Those recommendations include urging all sites where COVID-19 vaccines are being administered to be ready to handle anaphylaxis cases, including by having epinephrine at the ready. People who have been vaccinated should stay to be monitored for 15 minutes if they have no history of allergy and 30 minutes if they do.

There was no geographic clustering of cases and people who developed anaphylaxis were not all vaccinated from the same batch of vaccine, suggesting whatever is causing the reaction was not limited to a single batch of product.

[2] FDA statement on curative SARS-Cov-2 assay
Date: Mon 4 Jan 2021
Source: US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) News [edited]
https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/safety-communications/risk-false-results-curative-sars-cov-2-test-covid-19-fda-safety-communication


The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is alerting patients and healthcare providers of the risk of false results, particularly false negative results, with the Curative SARS-CoV-2 test. Risks to a patient of a false negative result include: delayed or lack of supportive treatment, lack of monitoring of infected individuals and their household or other close contacts for symptoms resulting in increased risk of spread of COVID-19 within the community, or other unintended adverse events.

To reduce the risk of false negative results, it is important to perform the test in accordance with its authorization and as described in the authorized labeling, such as the Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers. When the test is not performed in accordance with its authorization or as described in the authorized labeling, there is a greater risk that the results of the test may not be accurate.

Important recommendations for healthcare providers, patients, and caregivers
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Be aware of the important information regarding the use of the Curative SARS-Cov-2 test, which is described in the test's authorized labeling, including the following:
- Collection of nasal swabs and oral fluid specimens is limited to symptomatic individuals within 14 days of COVID-19 symptom onset.
- Specimen collection must be directly observed and directed during the sample collection process by a trained healthcare worker at the specimen collection site.
- A negative result does not rule out COVID-19 and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or patient management decisions. A negative result does not exclude the possibility of COVID-19.

Healthcare providers: Consider retesting your patients using a different test if you suspect an inaccurate result was given recently by the Curative SARS-CoV-2 test. If testing was performed more than 2 weeks ago, and there is no reason to suspect current SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is not necessary to retest.

Patients and caregivers: Talk to your healthcare provider if you think you were tested with the Curative SARS-CoV-2 test (the test name is displayed on this test's authorized Fact Sheets and, generally, the Fact Sheets must be provided with test result reports) and you have concerns about your test results.

Report any problems you experience with the Curative SARS-Cov-2 test to the FDA, including suspected inaccurate results.

Device description
------------------
The Curative SARS-CoV-2 Assay is a real-time RT-PCR test used to detect SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. This test is authorized for prescription-only use. The test is performed by collecting a throat swab, nasopharyngeal swab, nasal swab, or oral fluid specimen from an individual suspected of COVID-19 by their healthcare provider. Under the Emergency Use Authorization, the specimen is then to be processed at the KorvaLabs, Inc, laboratory, and results are returned to the patient.

Consistent with the test's authorized labeling, collection of nasal swabs and oral fluid specimens is limited to individuals who have shown symptoms of COVID-19 within 14 days of onset of the symptoms. Specimen collection must be directly observed and directed during the sample collection process by a trained healthcare worker at the specimen collection site.

Consistent with the EUA summary, negative results for SARS-CoV-2 RNA from oral fluid specimens should be confirmed by testing of another specimen type authorized for use with this test if clinically indicated.

FDA actions
-----------
The FDA regularly monitors the post-authorization use of tests, including reports of problems with test performance or results, and is providing this information to help educate patients, caregivers, and healthcare providers and reduce the risk of false results.

The FDA will keep the public informed if significant new information becomes available.

Reporting problems with a medical device
----------------------------------------
The FDA encourages stakeholders to report adverse events or suspected adverse events, including problems with test performance or results, through MedWatch, the FDA Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting program.

Generally, as specified in a test's EUA, device manufacturers and authorized laboratories must comply with applicable Medical Device Reporting (MDR) regulations.

[Summary data in the EUA authorization for the Analytical Sensitivity Results for Curative SARS-CoV-2 Assay indicate that the limit of detection is less reliable below 200 viral copies. Secondly, the Inclusivity of the Curative SARS-CoV-2 Assay is based on the established data comprises since it includes only primers and probes designed by CDC from the CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) real-time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel without any changes.

As for cross reactivity, the same explanation is given in the attached insert (https://www.fda.gov/media/137089/download).

It is also noted in the clinical performance section, "The data above does not support use of the Curative SARS-CoV-2, for any individuals for self-collected oral fluid samples when not directly observed and directed by a trained healthcare worker during collection and at the site of collection."

This was an emergency use authorization like so many assays for SARS-CoV2 and the post authorization performance data can help validate the assay as is the case here. - Mod.UBA]

ref: Greaney AJ, Loes AN, Crawford KHD, et al. Comprehensive mapping of mutations to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain that affect recognition by polyclonal human serum antibodies. bioRxiv preprint
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 could impair recognition of the virus by human antibody-mediated immunity. To facilitate prospective surveillance for such evolution, we map how convalescent serum antibodies are impacted by all mutations to the spike's receptor-binding domain (RBD), the main target of serum neutralizing activity. Binding by polyclonal serum antibodies is affected by mutations in 3 main epitopes in the RBD, but there is substantial variation in the impact of mutations both among individuals and within the same individual over time. Despite this inter- and intra-person heterogeneity, the mutations that most reduce antibody binding usually occur at just a few sites in the RBD's receptor binding motif. The most important site is E484, where neutralization by some sera is reduced more than 10-fold by several mutations, including one in emerging viral lineages in South Africa and Brazil. Going forward, these serum escape maps can inform surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 evolution.

Results
-------
In summary, our results suggest that E484 is the site of most concern for viral mutations that impact binding and neutralization by polyclonal serum antibodies targeting the RBD. However, mutations at the other serum antibody epitopes (such as the 443-450 loop and residues around 484 such as 455, 485, 486, and 490) are also worth monitoring, since they also have antigenic impacts.

Discussion
----------
We comprehensively mapped how mutations to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD affected binding by the antibodies in convalescent human serum. One major result is that serum antibody binding is predominantly affected by mutations at just a few dominant epitopes in the RBD. In particular, E484 is the site in the RBD where mutations usually have the largest effect on binding and neutralization -- possibly because E484 is often targeted by antibodies that utilize heavy-chain germline genes that are common among anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies, IGHV3-53 and IGHV3-66 (Barnes et al, 2020a; Greaney et al, 2020; Robbiani et al, 2020; Weisblum et al, 2020; Yuan et al, 2020; Zost et al, 2020b). Mutations at other structurally adjacent sites in the RBD's receptor binding ridge (such as L455, F456, G485, F486, and F490) can also have substantial antigenic effects. Another major epitope centered on the loop formed by residues 443-450 in the RBD's receptor-binding motif, and mutations in this epitope sometimes strongly affect serum antibody neutralization. A third epitope is in the core of the RBD distal from the receptor-binding motif, although mutations here tend to have smaller effects on serum antibody binding. Notably, RBD mutations reported by other studies to have large effects on serum neutralization are also in the epitope centered around E484 or in the 443-450 loop (Andreano et al, 2020; Li et al, 2020; Weisblum et al, 2020).

While the major serum epitopes are targeted by many well-characterized monoclonal antibodies (Barnes et al, 2020a; Baum et al, 2020; Greaney et al, 2020; Hansen et al., 2020; Starr et al, 2020a) , there are also sites where mutations that escape monoclonal antibodies have little effect on serum antibody binding for any sample we tested. For instance, mutations in the S309 epitope footprint (Pinto et al, 2020) and at sites of escape from antibody C135 (such as R346 and N440) (Barnes et al, 2020a; Weisblum et al, 2020) had minimal effects on serum antibody binding (Figures 3, S3). This lack of concordance between the epitopes of serum and monoclonal antibodies is consistent with other studies reporting that the specificities of potent monoclonal antibodies often do not recapitulate the sera from which they were isolated (Barnes et al, 2020b; Weisblum et al, 2020). These antibodies may be rare in polyclonal sera or the epitopes they target may be subdominant (Piccoli et al, 2020). However, these subdominant epitopes may become more important as SARS-CoV-2 evolves: after mutations at immunodominant sites such as E484 partially erode serum antibody neutralization, the remaining neutralization is presumably due to antibodies targeting previously subdominant epitopes.

Another key finding is that there is extensive person-to-person variation in how mutations affect serum antibody binding and neutralization. For instance, the neutralizing activity of several samples was reduced by more than 10-fold by single mutations to site E484, but a few samples were essentially unaffected by E484 mutations. Similarly, mutations at sites in the 443-450 loop (such as G446V) caused a large drop in serum antibody binding and neutralization for some samples but had little effect on others. This inter-individual heterogeneity is further compounded by the fact that the effects of mutations sometimes changed over time for samples longitudinally collected from the same individual.

These temporal changes could be due to a disproportionate decay in one dominant antibody clonotype, or a relative increase in antibodies targeting other epitopes (Gaebler et al, 2020).

There are several limitations to our study. Most importantly, we only examined mutations to the RBD. While we and others (Piccoli et al, 2020; Steffen et al, 2020) have shown that RBD-binding antibodies contribute the majority of the serum neutralizing activity of most convalescent human sera and plasma, antibodies also target other regions of the spike. For example, mutations and deletions in the NTD [N-terminal domain] can affect serum antibody neutralization (Andreano et al, 2020; Kemp et al, 2020b; Liu et al, 2020a; McCarthy et al, 2020; Voss et al, 2020), and are certainly of great importance. In addition, we only mapped samples from 11 individuals at 2 time points. Given the substantial inter- and intra-individual heterogeneity, mapping more samples may identify additional sites of importance. On a technical level, we assayed binding of antibodies to isolated RBD expressed by yeast, which implies several limitations. First, we are unable to map the effects of mutations that alter the spike's overall conformation or affect antibodies spanning quaternary epitopes (Barnes et al, 2020a). Second, our mapping likely overestimates the contributions of antibodies that bind epitopes that are more accessible on isolated RBD than in the context of full spike (such as F456). Finally, the N-linked glycans on yeast-expressed proteins are more mannose-rich than those on mammalian-expressed proteins (Hamilton et al, 2003), which could affect measurements of how N-linked glycans affect antibody binding. However, the general consistency of our mapping with our pseudovirus neutralization assays and the serum-escape mutations reported by others suggest that our study successfully defines the major RBD epitopes of convalescent human serum antibodies.

The comprehensive nature of our mapping makes it possible to begin to assess which circulating RBD mutations are likely to have the greatest impact on human immunity. In particular, emerging lineages in South Africa and Brazil carrying the E484K mutation will have greatly reduced susceptibility to neutralization by the polyclonal serum antibodies of some individuals. In contrast, the N501Y mutation present in the UK lineage is unlikely to greatly affect neutralization by most human sera, although it could contribute to increased viral titer or enhanced transmissibility (Kidd et al, 2020; Public Health England, 2020). The NTD deletions in this lineage, however, may have an antigenic effect (Andreano et al, 2020; Kemp et al, 2020b; McCarthy et al, 2020). More generally, our serum antibody mapping can be used with other functional characterization to assess the likely antigenic impacts of additional viral mutations that emerge in the future.

Our mapping also reveals broader features of antibody immunity that are relevant to SARS-CoV-2 evolution. One reason that influenza virus undergoes such rapid antigenic evolution is that neutralizing human immunity often focuses on just a few residues in hemagglutinin, such that a single mutation can dramatically reduce neutralization (Lee et al, 2019). In contrast, while measles virus can escape neutralization by monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal serum targets multiple co-dominant measles epitopes, meaning that no single mutation has a large effect on neutralization (Muñoz-Alía et al, 2020). Our results show that polyclonal antibody immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD is sometimes focused as for influenza, but in other cases more broadly targets the RBD in a way that mitigates the effect of any single mutation. This heterogeneity in the antigenic impacts of RBD mutations implies that the immunity of different individuals will be impacted differently by viral evolution.

It also suggests that an important area for future work is understanding how viral mutations impact vaccine-elicited immunity, and using this knowledge to design vaccines that are robust to viral antigenic evolution.

[SARS-CoV-2 has developed a substantial number of mutations, especially in the S-protein since its appearance in December 2019. With the advancement of the pandemic, accumulations of further mutations at the S-protein receptor-binding domain could enhance the infectivity and pathogenicity of the virus. Prediction and evaluation of such mutations are essential for understanding the potential development of more pathogenic strains and for COVID-19 management.

Therefore the concept of 'genomic' surveillance becomes very pertinent and countries should be encouraged to sequence at least a small subset of the SARS-CoV-2 samples so that the evolutionary changes can be picked up early and evaluated in terms of vaccine response or monoclonal antibody immuno-therapeutics. - Mod.UBA]

Abstract
--------
Since the 1st wave of coronavirus disease in March 2020, citizens and permanent residents returning to New Zealand have been required to undergo managed isolation and quarantine (MIQ) for 14 days and mandatory testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of [20 Oct 2020], of 62 698 arrivals, testing of persons in MIQ had identified 215 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among 86 passengers on a flight from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, that arrived in New Zealand on [29 Sep 2020], test results were positive for 7 persons in MIQ. These passengers originated from 5 different countries before a layover in Dubai; 5 had negative predeparture SARS-CoV-2 test results. To assess possible points of infection, we analyzed information about their journeys, disease progression, and virus genomic data. All 7 SARS-CoV-2 genomes were genetically identical, except for a single mutation in 1 sample. Despite predeparture testing, multiple instances of in-flight SARS-CoV-2 transmission are likely.

In response to the growing international risks associated with importation of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), on [20 Mar 2020], New Zealand closed its borders to all but New Zealand citizens, permanent residents, and persons with an exemption (1). On [9 Apr 2020], to better control importation risks, New Zealand implemented a system of managed isolation and quarantine (MIQ) at the border. Persons arriving in New Zealand were required to stay in a government-assigned MIQ facility for at least 14 days before entering the New Zealand community. In June 2020, a system of testing persons who were returning to New Zealand and staying in MIQ facilities was instituted; nasopharyngeal swabs were taken on approximately the 3rd and the 12th day of the quarantine period and from anyone in whom symptoms developed or those identified as close contacts of persons with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive test results.

On [29 Sep 2020], flight EK448, which originated in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, with a stop in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, landed in Auckland, New Zealand. During the required 14-day MIQ period, 7 passengers who had traveled on the flight received positive SARS-CoV-2 test results. The 7 passengers had begun their journeys from 5 different countries before a layover in Dubai; predeparture SARS-CoV-2 test results were negative for 5 (Figure 1). These 7 passengers had been seated within 4 rows of each other during the approximately 18-hour flight from Dubai to Auckland. Because recent studies have reported conflicting findings of the risks associated with in-flight transmission (2-4), we undertook a comprehensive investigation to determine the potential source of infection of these travelers.

Figure 1: Countries of travel origins for 7 passengers who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection after traveling on the same flight (EK448) from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, to Auckland, New Zealand, with a refueling stop in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on [29 Sep 2020]. Asterisks indicate where 6 other genetically identical genomes have been reported (5).

Methods
-------
Case details and consent
In New Zealand, COVID-19 is a notifiable disease; all positive cases are reported to the national surveillance system, enabling further public health investigation. All persons with COVID-19 described in this article were contacted, and they provided written or verbal consent for their data to be used in this article. Case data were collected under the Ministry of Health contract for epidemic surveillance. The 7 persons with COVID-19 are denoted here as passengers A-G (Tables 1, 2).

Table 1: Detailed information for 7 passengers with SARS-CoV-2 infection detected after being on flight EK448, Dubai, United Arab Emirates, to Auckland, New Zealand, [29 Sep 2020]
Table 2: Travel times for 7 passengers with SARS-CoV-2 infection detected after being on flight EK448, Dubai, United Arab Emirates, to Auckland, New Zealand, [29 Sep 2020]

Clinical data and sample collection
Case details were sourced from the national notifiable diseases database, EpiSurv (https://surv.esr.cri.nz/episurv/index.php). While in MIQ, all 86 passengers on the flight underwent real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 on day 3 and again on day 12 if the previous test result was negative. Cabin crew members departed New Zealand soon after their arrival and were therefore not tested. Investigations used information from rRT-PCR testing by using the Cepheid GeneXpert system (https://www.cepheid.com) and BD Max (https://www.bd.com). We determined seating plans by consulting the flight manifest for the Boeing 777-300ER aircraft and confirmed them by administering a questionnaire to passengers, asking where they actually sat.

Genome sequencing
Independent viral extracts were prepared by the Institute of Environmental Science and Research (Porirua, New Zealand) from the 7 positive respiratory tract samples in which SARS-CoV-2 was initially detected by rRT-PCR. We extracted RNA from SARS-CoV-2-positive samples and subjected it to whole-genome sequencing by following the 1200-bp amplicon protocol (6) and Oxford Nanopore Rapid barcoding R9.0 sequencing (7). Genomic data are available on GISAID (5) (Table 1).

Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes
The lineage of the genomes obtained from the 7 passengers was determined by using pangolin version 2.0.8 (https://pangolin.cog-uk.io) and compared with genomes from the same lineage available on GISAID (5). Genomes were aligned by using MAFFT version 7 (8) and using the FFT-NS-2 progressive alignment algorithm. We estimated a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree by using IQ-TREE version 1.6.8 (9) and the Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano nucleotide substitution model (10) with a gamma distributed rate variation among sites (HKY+gamma) the best-fit model as determined by ModelFinder (11), and branch support assessment by using the ultrafast bootstrap method (12).

Analysis of disease transmission data
All times and dates reported here were converted to New Zealand daylight savings time (Greenwich mean time + 13 hours) (Table 2). The mean incubation period, defined as the duration between estimated dates of infection and reported symptom onset, has been reported as 5-6 days (range 1-14 days) (13). We assumed a 5-day incubation period for passengers A, B, D, E, F, and G, and a 3-day incubation period for passenger C. We considered the median presymptomatic infectious period to be less than 1-4 days unless a negative PCR result indicated otherwise (14).

Results
-------
The flight
Flight EK448 from Dubai, UAE to Auckland, New Zealand, was an 18-hour, 2-minute flight on a Boeing 777-300ER aircraft. It departed Dubai on [28 Sep 2020], at 5:29 pm; arrived in Kuala Lumpur on [29 Sep 2020] at 12:11 am to refuel; and departed Kuala Lumpur on [29 Sep 2020] at 2:03 am. No passengers entered or exited the aircraft during the 2-hour refueling period in Kuala Lumpur. The flight arrived in Auckland on [29 Sep 2020] at 11:31 am. During the flight and before departure in Dubai airport, mask use was not mandatory; passengers A, B, D, F, and G self-reported mask and glove use while on the airplane but passengers C and E did not. In the days before the flight, these 7 passengers (other than the 2 travel groups, 1 of which comprised passengers A and B and the other passengers F and G) had been in different countries and did not have any form of contact (Figure 1). Similarly, none of the passengers reported having been in close contact at the Dubai airport. Passengers F and G were part of a family travel group of 4, all of whom reported having changed seats within their row during the flight.

All passengers, with the exception of passenger E, were transferred by bus to an MIQ facility in Rotorua, New Zealand. All passengers reported wearing masks during the bus journeys. Passengers A, B, and D were on bus 1; passengers F and G were on bus 2. Passenger C was initially seated on bus 1 but was transferred to bus 2 before transit. Both buses departed Auckland at 12:05 pm and arrived in Rotorua at 3:00 pm. Passenger E traveled on bus 3 to an MIQ facility in Auckland. Seating on all buses was physically distanced where possible, and mask use was mandated.

Testing and disease progression
Five passengers reported having received negative test results before departure (Table 1). A negative test result was mandatory according to airline regulations for passenger C, who traveled from Ukraine.

The 1st 3 passengers to receive positive SARS-CoV-2 test results (passengers A, B, and C) were identified through routine surveillance testing on the 3rd day of the quarantine period in New Zealand (Figure 2). Passengers A and B traveled together from Switzerland; both reported having had negative test results in their country of origin, less than 72 hours before boarding the flight. They departed Zurich, Switzerland, and arrived in Dubai on [28 Sep 2020], at 08:02 am. Passenger A reported symptom onset (general weakness and muscle pain) while in MIQ on [1 Oct 2020], and passenger B reported symptom onset (rhinorrhea, general weakness, cough, and muscle pain) on October 2. Test results for samples collected on October 2 from both persons were positive.

Figure 2: Timeline of likely incubation and infectious periods, indicating testing dates, for 7 passengers who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection after traveling on the same flight (EK448) from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, to Auckland, New Zealand, with a refueling stop in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on [29 Sep 2020].

Test results for passenger C were also positive on [2 Oct 2020], but the passenger did not report symptoms at any time during the infection. This person had traveled from Kiev, Ukraine, and arrived in Dubai on [28 Sep 2020] at 5:59 am.

Test results for passenger D were negative on [2 Oct 2020], but the passenger reported symptoms on the 5th day after arrival in New Zealand. The symptoms progressively worsened, and another test on [7 Oct 2020] returned a positive result. Reported symptoms included coryza, headache, muscle pain, general weakness, irritability, confusion, and a head cold. This passenger had departed from Dublin, Ireland, and arrived in Dubai on [28 Sep 2020] at 9:05 am.

Test results for passenger E were negative on [2 Oct 2020], but the passenger was retested on [6 Oct 2020] as a potential close contact of those on the airplane and found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2. This passenger was not in the same MIQ facility (nor the same city) in New Zealand as the other passengers with reported cases and did not report symptoms during the infection. This passenger had departed from Kochi, India, and arrived in Dubai on [25 Sep 2020] at 6:35 pm.

Test results for passengers F and G (part of a group of 4 family members traveling together) were negative on [2 Oct 2020] in New Zealand. Passenger F became mildly symptomatic (coryza and a cough) on [2 Oct 2020] and self-reported having had a negative test result before leaving South Africa. The group was retested as potential contacts of those on the flight with positive results, and on [8 Oct 2020], results were positive for passengers F and G. Passenger G reported coryza and a sore throat on [9 Oct 2020]. The 4-person travel group had departed from Johannesburg, South Africa, and arrived in Dubai on [28 Sep 2020] at 11:45 am. The 4 family members were seated in 4 adjacent seats in row 24 but interchanged seats within the row, such that no specific seat can be determined for each passenger (Figure 2). Test results were positive for only 2 of the 4 family members; after receiving the positive results, the persons were separated in the MIQ facility.

The 1st person to experience symptoms was passenger A on [1 Oct 2020], consistent with having been infectious while on flight EK448 2 days earlier (Figure 3). The 2nd person to experience symptoms, on [2 Oct 2020], was passenger B, a travel companion of passenger A, which may represent shared exposure to a source A, such that passenger B's infection is not considered a case of in-flight transmission. Passenger C was asymptomatic and received a positive test result on day 3. Symptom onset and positive test result dates for passengers D, E, and F were all consistent with in-flight transmission. Passenger G was a travel companion of passenger F, and their date of symptom onset was consistent with infection during their stay in an MIQ facility, where they resided in the same room. As such, passenger G's infection was not considered a result of in-flight transmission.

Figure 3: Seating arrangement (Boeing 777-300ER) for 7 passengers who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection on flight EK448 from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, to Auckland, New Zealand, with a refueling stop in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on [29 Sep 2020]. Passengers F and G interchanged seats within row 24. Open circles represent nearby passengers who were negative for SARS-CoV-2 on days 3 and 12 while in managed isolation and quarantine. All other seats shown remained empty.

Viral genomic data
All SARS-CoV-2 samples from the 7 passengers were subjected to whole-genome sequencing for surveillance purposes. The sequences obtained were assigned to lineage B.1 and were genetically identical, apart from 1 mutation for the sample from passenger D (Figure 4) (15). By comparing these 7 genomes to the international database (GISAID), we identified 6 additional identical genomes: 4 from Switzerland and 2 from the United Kingdom, sampled during [2-23 Sep 2020]. These findings were consistent with virus introduction onto the airplane from Switzerland by passenger A, B, or both (Figure 5). Nevertheless, accurately identifying the source of this outbreak may be impeded by substantial biases and gaps in global sequencing data (J. Geoghegan, unpub. data, https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.28.20221853v1); hence, we cannot explicitly exclude passenger C as the source.

Discussion
----------
Evidence of in-flight transmission on a flight from the United Arab Emirates to New Zealand is strongly supported by the epidemiologic data, in-flight seating plan, symptom onset dates, and genomic data for this group of travelers who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (passengers A-G). Among the 7 passengers, 2 (A and B) were probably index case-patients infected before the flight, 4 (C, D, E, and F) were probably infected during the flight, and the remaining passenger (G) was probably infected while in MIQ. All 7 passengers were seated in aisle seats within 2 rows of where the presumed index case-patient(s) were seated.

Combined, these data present a likely scenario of 4 or more SARS-CoV-2 transmission events during a long-haul flight from Dubai to Auckland. These transmission events occurred despite reported in-flight use of masks and gloves. Further transmission between travel companions then occurred after the flight, in an MIQ facility.

These conclusions are supported by genome sequencing, an in-flight seating plan, and dates of disease onset. These data do not definitively exclude an alternative exposure event, such as virus transmission at the Dubai airport before boarding (such as during check-in or in boarding queues). However, the close proximity of the relevant passengers on board suggests that in-flight transmission is plausible.

Similar reports of SARS-CoV-2 being transmitted during flight have recently been published. Those reports, along with the findings we report, demonstrate the potential for SARS-CoV-2 to spread on long-haul flights. It must also be noted that the auxiliary power unit of the flight EK448 aircraft was reported as having been inoperative for approximately 30 minutes during the 2-hour refueling stop in Kuala Lumpur, such that the environmental control system would not have been working during this period.

That 3 passengers had positive test results on day 3 of their 14-day quarantine period indicates some of the complexities of determining the value of predeparture testing, including the modality and timing of any such testing. Although not definitive, these findings underscore the value of considering all international passengers arriving in New Zealand as being potentially infected with SARS-CoV-2, even if predeparture testing was undertaken, social distancing and spacing were followed, and personal protective equipment was used in-flight.

[Non-pharmaceutical interventions such as distancing and restricted crew/passenger interaction can contribute to prevention of in-flight COVID-19 transmission, and recent studies speculate that face coverings confer protection.

Sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 can provide valuable information on virus biology, transmission, and population dynamics. Genomic sequencing for cases travelling from 3 different continents strongly supports the epidemiological transmission hypothesis of a point source for this outbreak. The ability of genomics to resolve transmission events may increase as the virus evolves and accumulates greater diversity.

Based on the findings of the report above, the following measures are important to consider:
- when a positive COVID-19 case is linked to a flight, rapid flight contact tracing may prevent onward spread;
- some options include use of digitalised public health passenger locator forms and development of improved systems of tracing.
- enhanced surveillance should include transiting/transfer information to identify potential common links.

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (279 010), Brazil (62 532), and UK (62 322) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 15 335 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (5-6 Jan 2021). Over the past 48 hours the number of cases reported per day has increased by 100 000 per day with over 15 000 deaths reported per day. This could be a catch-up artifact of some data that has now been reported. The worrying trend needs to be closely monitored though.

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (16 countries) include the USA, Brazil, UK, Germany (26 663), France (25 379), Russia (24 217), South Africa (21 832), India (20 460), Italy (20 326), Czechia (17 332), Colombia (16 805), Poland (14 220), Turkey (13 830), Argentina (13 441), Mexico (13 345), and Portugal (10 027). A total of 56 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 28 of the 56 countries that reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 12 are from the Americas region, 9 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 2 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 14.1%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 5.6%.

Impression: The global daily reported cases are over 800 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours and over 84 million cumulative reported cases with almost 1.89 million reported deaths. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts even with reductions in daily case reports due to the period, followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, South East Asia, and Western Pacific regions. - Mod.UBA]
