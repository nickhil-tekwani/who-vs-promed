The Federal Government on [Mon 16 Oct 2017] confirmed 3 fresh cases of monkeypox virus [in Bayelsa], insisting that all cases from Lagos tested negative. The Minister of Health, Isaac Adewole said the 3 suspected samples of the virus sent to Senegal for testing, have been confirmed.

TheNewsGuru.com reports that the samples were sent to the World Health Organization, WHO's laboratory in Dakar, the Senegalese capital. [These are the same 3 confirmed cases in the ProMED-mail post yesterday (16 Oct 2017) see Monkeypox - Africa (10): Nigeria: 20171016.5384844].

TheNewsGuru.com recalls that minister had earlier announced on [Wed 11 Oct 2017] that the Centre for Disease Control had taken samples for laboratory analysis at the Redeemed University in Ede, Osun State, and in Senegal.

In his words: "As of [Fri 13 Oct 2017], there were 17 suspected cases reported from Yenagoa LGA in Bayelsa State. We have received laboratory confirmation for monkeypox virus from 3 of these cases from the WHO Regional Laboratory in Dakar, Senegal. Samples from 12 other cases from Bayelsa were negative. With these results, 4 suspected monkeypox outbreaks in Yenagoa [a Local Government Area in Bayelsa State] have been confirmed with laboratory evidence.

"The most likely source of infection is a primary zoonotic transmission, from an animal, with secondary person-to-person transmission.

"Since our initial announcement, a total of 43 other suspected cases have been reported from 8 other States (Akwa Ibom, Cross River, Ekiti, Lagos, Enugu, Nasarawa, Rivers, and FCT). Of these, 4 cases from Lagos have also been tested and confirmed to be negative for the Monkeypox virus.

"We expect that many of these cases being reported from other states in Nigeria are not caused by the monkeypox virus, but we will continue to investigate all those cases that fit the case definition.

"Further laboratory tests using whole genome sequencing are being carried out by the Africa Centre for Genomics and Infectious Diseases in Redeemers University Ede, Ogun State."

[The number of suspected monkeypox virus cases has increased from 33 reported on 12 Oct 2017 to 43 reported above and the number of reporting states increased from 7 to 8. However, some of these cases have been attributed previously to varicella (chickenpox) virus infections. The numbers of confirmed monkeypox cases mentioned in the above report are conflicting. Although it mentions 4 confirmed cases, only 3 are reported as being confirmed by the WHO reference laboratory in Senegal. The 3 confirmed cases may represent spill-over from monkeypox virus rodent reservoir hosts.

The main reservoirs of monkeypox virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp; an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_). Laboratory confirmation of the etiologies of these 43 suspected cases either as monkeypox, chickenpox or some other pathogen are essential in order to understand what is going on. There may well be more than one pathogen circulating in the 8 states.
