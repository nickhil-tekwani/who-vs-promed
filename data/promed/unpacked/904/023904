The Ministry of Health of C칩rdoba is now reporting 46 cases of [trichinellosis], which is up from the 13 infections the agency reported earlier this month [April 2022].

Most of those ill are from C칩rdoba [capital city] but 5 live in Santa Rosa de Calamuchita and 4 in De치n Funes. Patients have been treated in different healthcare centers.

The Ministry of Health told people to take care when eating or selling pork products, adding that symptoms can initially be confused with the flu or COVID-19. The agency also warned against the consumption of raw meats or homemade sausages that have not been inspected prior to processing.

Public health officials urged people to check the label on all purchased pork products for information including the brand, company name, establishment authorization number, storage conditions, and date of manufacture and expiry.

Patient interviews confirmed the consumption of salami and chorizo but no brand has been identified. The origin of the food could not be established and investigations are ongoing, said authorities.

Past outbreak and about _Trichinella_
-------------------------------------
In late 2021, C칩rdoba had almost 250 cases of trichinosis linked to eating pork products.

Investigations found a link to pork meat, sausages, and salami from different businesses in Villa del Totoral. In some cases, this meat was resold to other vendors. The presence of _Trichinella spiralis_ larvae was confirmed in one test from seized products.

Trichinellosis, or trichinosis, is a disease transmitted by eating raw or undercooked pork contaminated with the parasite Trichinella, which is not visible to the naked eye.

Initial symptoms of infection in people are nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue, fever, and abdominal discomfort. Headaches, fevers, chills, cough, swelling of the face and eyes, aching joints, and muscle pains. Itchy skin, diarrhea, or constipation may follow. Patients may have difficulty coordinating movements and have heart and breathing problems.

Abdominal symptoms can occur one to 2 days after infection. Further symptoms usually start 2 to 8 weeks after eating contaminated meat. Freezing, curing or salting, drying, smoking, or microwaving meat may not kill the organism. The best way to prevent trichinellosis is to cook meat to a temperature of 71 degrees C (160 degrees F).

[Argentina has been struggling with _Trichinella_ infections for the past decade as seen by the ProMED posts listed below. The key issue is the sale of meat from so-called "backyard" pigs, sold on local markets primarily as sausages without veterinary inspection. - Mod.EP
