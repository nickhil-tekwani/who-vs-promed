[The quarterly report (29 pages) has become available on-line since 7
Aug 2009. - Mod.AS]

[1] Summary
-----------
There were no outbreaks officially reported in FMD-free countries
that did not practice vaccination between April and June 2009.
FMD type A in the Middle East
-----------------------------
In the Middle East, the A-Iran-05 strain continues to evolve and
spread to previously unaffected countries. During the present
reporting period it has appeared for the 1st time in Israel and the
Palestinian Autonomous Territories. During the past 2 years 4
distinct sub-lineages have been recognised and named A-Iran-05ARD-07,
A-Iran-05EZM-07, A-Iran-05AFG-07 and A-Iran-05BAR-08. The 1st 2 have
evolved within Turkey and have not spread to the rest of the Middle
East. A-Iran-05AFG-07 has appeared in Afghanistan (2007), Iran
(2008-2009), Pakistan (2008-2009) and Bahrain (2009). A-Iran-05BAR-08
has become the most widespread sub-lineage appearing in Bahrain
(2008), Iran (2009), Pakistan (2009), Lebanon (2009), Iraq (2009),
Israel (2009), Kuwait (2009), Libya (2009) and the Palestinian AT (2009).

FMD type O in Egypt
-------------------
Sequence analysis has shown that outbreaks of FMDV type O appear to
be very closely related to the Egyptian vaccine strain, O1/Sharquia/EGY/72.

FMD type A in China
-------------------
Since its apparent introduction in January 2009, FMD type A continues
to appear sporadically in many parts of the country as does Asia1
(which was apparently introduced in 2005).

FMD type O in Taiwan
--------------------
In February 2009, Taiwan reported the 1st outbreak of type O since
2001. In the last 3 months further outbreaks have been reported.

FMD type Asia 1 in Bahrain
--------------------------
The appearance of Asia 1 in Bahrain in 2009 has been linked to
viruses from India.

FMD types SAT 2 in Botswana
---------------------------
SAT 2 continues to cause problems in the north-east of the country.

Uncharacterised FMD viruses
---------------------------
A number of other outbreaks have occurred where samples have not been
sent to the WRLFMD. It is probable that the countries involved have
performed their own genetic characterisation; however, through the
OIE/FAO laboratory network we would also like to encourage the
submission of samples (or complete VP1 sequences) to the WRLFMD.

WRL vaccine recommendations have changed from the previous report
(Annex 3) [see item 2] to take into account the availability of new
vaccines against the FMDV serotype A Iran-05 strain.

An up-to-date list and reports of FMD viruses characterised by
sequencing can be found at the following website:
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2009.htm>.

[2] Vaccine matching (see also item 4)
--------------------------------------

a. Serotype O, Middle East
--------------------------
4 FMDV type O isolates (O IRN 7 and 14/2009; and O TUR 3 and 35/2009)
from Iran and Turkey collected in 2009 were further characterised by
2 dimensional virus neutralisation test (2dmVNT) and/or LPBE. The
results showed that 2 isolates from Iran were antigenically matched
with O Manisa if a high potency vaccine was used but there was not a
close match to O BFS or O IND R2/75. O TUR 35/2009 was antigenically
relatively close to O 4174 if a high potency vaccine was used. O TUR
3/2009 showed no match with O Manisa, O BFS and O 4174.

b. Serotype A, Middle East
--------------------------
6 FMDV type A viruses (A TUR 7, 14 and 40/2009; A ETH 12 and 13/2009;
and A LIB 14 and 117/2009) from Turkey, Ethiopia and Libya collected
in 2009, were analysed for antigenic relationship with various
vaccine strains by 2dmVNT and/or LPBE. All isolates tested showed
close match to the A TUR 06 vaccine strain but failed to match with
A22 IRQ except A LIB 14/2009 which showed a relative match with A22.
2 viruses isolated from Ethiopia were antigenically close to A
Eritrea 98 vaccine but not to A SAU 41/91, A IRN 99 and A IRN 87. 2
viruses from Turkey showed no antigenic match with A SAU 41/91, A IRN
99 and A IRN 87 while A TUR 40/2009 showed a low match to A Eritrea
98 by LPBE. A LIB 14/2009 gave a match with A SAU 41/91 but not with
A Eritrea 98 while A LIB 117/2009 showed no antigenic relationship
with either A Eritrea 98 or A SAU 41/91.

[3] Detailed information: ASIA - Middle East and Southern Asia, AFRICA - North
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[The respective articles on each of the following, covered countries
include outbreaks' maps and dendograms].

1. Bahrain: 2 FMD Asia 1 viruses were isolated from cattle at Al
Bahama, Manama (20/04/2009). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that they
were distinct from previous viruses found in the region. However,
comparison with recently isolated viruses from India revealed a close
relationship (B. Pattnaik, personal communication, 2009). A single
FMD type A virus isolate (from 2009) belonged to the ASIA topotype,
A-Iran-05BAR-08 strain.

2. Egypt: 16 FMD type O viruses were isolated from samples taken in
2009. All belonged to the ME-SA topotype and were very closely
related to the Egyptian vaccine/reference strain O1/Sharquia/EGY/72.

3. Iran: 8 FMD type O and 8 type A viruses were isolated from
samples collected in 2009. Phylogenetic analyses are in progress.

4. Israel: 26 FMD type O viruses were isolated (25 from 2007 and one
from 2008); phylogenetic analyses are in progress. 18 FMD type A
viruses were isolated from samples collected in 2009. 9 of these have
been sequenced and shown to belong to the ASIA topotype,
A-Iran-05BAR-08 strain.

5. Libya: 3 outbreaks of FMD type A, which occurred in January and
February 2009, were reported to the OIE. They occurred in cattle at
Alhwary, Banghazi (01 Jan 2009), Tamina, Misratah (20 Feb 2009) and
Bair Trfas, Az Zawiyah (23 Feb 2009). Sequence analysis was reported
in the Jan-Mar FMD Reference Laboratory Network Report showing the
viruses to be of the ASIA topotype, Iran-05BAR-08 strain.

6. Nepal: 12 FMD type O viruses were isolated from samples collected
in 2009; phylogenetic analyses are in progress.

7. Palestinian Autonomous Territories: 20 FMD type O viruses,
collected in 2007, were identified; phylogenetic analyses are in progress.
5 FMD type A viruses, collected in 2009, were identified and shown to
belong to the ASIA topotype, A-Iran-05BAR-08 strain.

8. Pakistan: 9 FMD type A viruses were identified, but details of
the geographic origin are not clear. Phylogenetic analyses are in progress.

9. Yemen Arab Republic: 38 type O FMD viruses isolated during the
previous reporting period we analysed and shown to belong to the EA-3
topotype. 25 of the viruses, collected in 2009, were closely related
to Ethiopian viruses also collected in 2009. 6 viruses from 2008 and
5 from 2009 belonged to a different sub-lineage of EA-3 and were most
closely related to viruses from Ethiopia in 2008 and Yemen in 2006.

[4] Recommendations from WRLFMD on FMD virus strains to be included
in FMDV antigen banks* - June 2009
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

High Priority (not in order of importance):
O Manisa (covers panasian topotype)
O BFS or Campos
A24 Cruzeiro
Asia 1 Shamir
A Iran-05 (newly available)
A22 Iraq
SAT 2 Saudi Arabia (or equivalent)

[* The vaccine banks involved is mainly related to the EUFMD member
countries. - Mod.AS]

[The most significant development during the covered period is the
further spread within the Middle East of the new, emerging FMD
serotype A Iran-05 and its homologues. The only country in the region
which has not yet -- reportedly -- been affected is Syria (Jordan
reported this serotype in 2006). In difference with previous serotype
A strains in the Middle East (since 1963), which caused severe
clinical disease in cattle but seemed rather benign for sheep, the 'A
Iran-05' strains seem to clinically affect small ruminants as well.
Their pathogenicity for pigs is not yet known, since no outbreaks in
porcines have been registered so far.

As observed in the field, and confirmed by the data of the WRLFMD --
based upon sero-neutralisation and liquid phase blocking ELISA (LPBE)
tests -- the previous Middle Eastern vaccine strain A22 Irq is
"unlikely to protect" against the new strain. For details, refer to
table C "Antigenic characterisation of FMD field isolates by matching
with vaccine strains by VNT and/or LPBE; r1 value data from 1st April
to 30th June 2009," available on page 24 of the quarterly Report at
the above URL.

Consequently, a specific A-Iran-05 or homologous vaccine has been
recommended by WRLFMD. At least 2 European vaccine manufacturers have
already produced batches of such vaccine. - Mod.AS].
