[The most recent case is in Bolomba. It is becoming increasingly difficult to get current up to date information on the Equateur outbreak. I am, therefore, depending on tweets when they are available. Fortunately, Helen Branswell appears to have good access to the numbers. See her tweet for the latest table of case numbers and deaths. - Mod.LK]

[2] Summary
- Equateur outbreak

The number of reported Ebola cases in western Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has surpassed the African nation's 2018 outbreak numbers in the same region, World Health Organization officials said on Thu 16 Jul 2020.

"There are now 56 cases, and this is of great concern, particularly as it is now surpassing the previous (2018) outbreak in this area, which was closed off and controlled at a total of 54 cases," said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa, referring to DRC's Equateur province, a large region bordering the Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic.

The challenges of responding to Ebola cases amid the COVID-19 pandemic, he added, are exacerbated by inadequate funding and rough terrain. "The current Ebola outbreak is running into headwinds because cases are scattered across remote areas in dense rain forests," he said. "This makes for a costly response, as ensuring that responders and supplies reach affected populations is extremely challenging."

Without ramped-up financial support for health education and community engagement, vaccinations, testing, contact tracing and treatment, the USD 1.75 million in WHO-mobilized funds will last only a few more weeks. WHO also noted some improvements in outbreak response logistics since 2018. Vaccinations began 4 days after the latest outbreak was announced on 1 Jun 2020, in stark contrast to the 2018 outbreak, in which officials waited over 2 weeks to begin vaccinations.

Of the 12 000 vaccinations carried out over the past 6 weeks, 90% were dispensed in local communities, and over 40 000 homes were visited by health workers, a comparatively intensified local response that health care professionals had called for in the wake of prior outbreaks.

Of the 56 reported cases [now 58] in the current outbreak -- the central African country's 11th -- 53 are confirmed, and 3 [now 5] are probable. [At least] 28 of them were reported in the past 3 weeks.

One of the world's most impoverished countries, DRC is also facing the world's largest and fastest-moving measles epidemic, with 310 000 confirmed cases and an estimated 6000 fatalities -- mostly children -- since the beginning of 2019.

COVID-19 has infected more than 8199 in the DRC and has claimed 193 lives, according to Johns Hopkins University.

["The growth in the outbreak concerns the World Health Organization (WHO). Responding to Ebola in the midst of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is complex, but we must not let COVID-19 distract us from tackling other pressing health threats," said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa.

Anne Rimoin (an American epidemiologist who has run a research and training program in DRC for nearly 20 years) retweeted from Dr Krutika <Kuppalli@KrutikaKuppalli> [https://twitter.com/KrutikaKuppalli/status/1284152293437239296]: "The growing #Ebola outbreak in #DRC has taken a backseat to #COVID19. If @WHO doesn't get funds urgently needed to help fight it, they will run out over the next few weeks. Imagine a situation where #Ebola spreads [because] the experts don't have resources."

Ebola and COVID-19 both could explode at any time if community spread occurs, particularly in the absence of an intensive vaccination campaign against Ebola and availability of a vaccine against COVID-19. - Mod.LK]

- Equateur: cases surpass 2018 outbreak

The Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo's (DRC) Equateur Province continues to grow, causing major concern as the World Health Organization (WHO) and partners face critical funding gaps. Confirmed cases have now surpassed the total number recorded during the province's last outbreak in 2018.

The latest outbreak, DRC's 11th, was declared on 1 Jun 2020 after a cluster of cases was detected in Mbandaka area of Equateur Province. The outbreak has since spread to 6 health zones, with 56 cases recorded. The city of Mbandaka and its surroundings were also the site of the country's 9th Ebola outbreak, which lasted from May to July 2018 and in which 54 cases were confirmed.

The ongoing Ebola response is also facing funding shortfalls. So far, WHO has mobilized USD 1.75 million, which will last only a few more weeks. Additional support is needed to rapidly scale up the efforts by WHO, the DRC health authorities, and partners to ensure all the affected communities receive key services including health education and community engagement, vaccination, testing, contact tracing and treatment.

Significant achievements have been made since the outbreak began. In 6 weeks, more than 12 000 people have been vaccinated. During the 2018 outbreak in Equateur, it took 2 weeks to start vaccinations. This time around, vaccinations started within 4 days of the outbreak being declared.

The current response builds on lessons learned from the country's previous Ebola outbreaks, which underscored the importance of working closely with communities. Around 90% of the vaccinators in the ongoing outbreak are from the local communities. The response has also been able to tap into the expertise of laboratory technicians trained during the 2018 outbreak, with 26 laboratory technicians currently supporting diagnostics. Working with local responders is inspiring trust between communities and health workers and making the emergency response more effective.

WHO, along with the Ministry of Health and partners, has been engaging with communities to increase understanding of the virus and local support for response activities. More than 40 000 households have been visited by community health workers, and more than 273 000 people have been provided with health and safety information.
