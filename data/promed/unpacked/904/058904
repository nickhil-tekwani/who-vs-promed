Cambodia: Dengue Fever and Malaria Cases on the Increase
--------------------------------------------------------
Malaria and dengue fever have been prevalent recently in some provinces and
municipalities in Cambodia, said Duong Socheat, Director of the National
Center for Parasitology, Entomology and Malaria Control. He said and the
World Health Organization (WHO) is helping Cambodia eliminate mosquitos
related to the diseases.
The morbidity of malaria and dengue rose steeply in Phnom Penh, and the
Provinces of Kandal, Kompong Cham, and Banteay Meanchey, where a total of
1007 people were found to have contracted the 2 diseases, he said, adding
some of them have been hospitalized and 3 people have died. Malaria and
Dengue have now spread to other provinces such as Takeo and Kampot, and
even Stung Treng Province, where dengue has not been seen during the past 6
years.
The WHO office in Phnom Penh has donated 80 tons of mosquito pesticides to
the affected areas, and it will provide another 40 tons to help kill the pests

New Zealand: Increase in Travel-related Cases of Dengue Fever
-------------------------------------------------------------
More New Zealanders are falling ill with the potentially fatal dengue fever
after failing to take sufficient precautions against mosquito bites while
travelling in the tropics. Dengue fever is an acute mosquito-borne disease
which kills about 25 000 people a year world-wide from an estimated 20
million cases. Typical symptoms include high fevers, muscle aches,
vomiting, exhaustion and often depression, but a severe form, called dengue
hemorrhagic fever, can kill.
In New Zealand dengue fever has been relatively rare, with an average of 14
cases a year between 1995 and 2000. But public health researchers said the
incidence of the disease soared last year, with a record 93 cases reported.
Researchers at the Environmental and Science Research Institute said many
reasons had been suggested for an explosion of dengue fever world-wide,
including increased travel, urbanization, population growth, crowding,
poverty and weaker public health measures. But they remain puzzled by the
surge in cases in New Zealand. Even during the dengue pandemic of 1998
there were only 26 cases reported, which suggested the big number of cases
in New Zealand was not due to factors such as increased travel. Institute
researcher Rabia Khan said it was also not likely the increase was due to
improved diagnosis as an Auckland study had shown that even where a patient
had recently travelled to the tropics, doctors were not initially
considering dengue in making a diagnosis.
The country most commonly visited by dengue fever patients in New Zealand
was Samoa (59 cases), followed by Tahiti (8), Indonesia and Thailand (5
each), Cook Islands, The Tokelaus and East Timor (3 each), Philippines (2),
and Fiji, India and Sri Lanka (one each).
Dengue fever can be transmitted by the _Aedes egypti_, _Aedes albopictus_,
and _Aedes polynesiensis_ mosquitoes, and the first 2 have been among the
dozen interceptions of exotic mosquitos at the border since January 1998.

Guatemala: "Yellow Alert" Declared Due to Dengue in El Salvador
---------------------------------------------------------------
GUATEMALA CITY: Guatemalan health officials declared a permanent "yellow
alert" along the Salvadoran border due to an epidemic of dengue fever in
that country, a government spokesman said on Wed 12 Jun 2002.
Guatemalan Public Health and Social Assistance Ministry spokesman Jose
Candido Barrillas said that a health cordon has been strengthened in the
border region. Barrillas told EFE that the "yellow alert" along the
Guatemalan-Salvadoran border will be permanent due to the constant flow of
Salvadorans into Guatemala.
Only one case of dengue hemorrhagic fever was reported in Guatemala last
year, and so far this year, there have been no cases reported. However,
there have been 818 suspected cases of classic dengue of which 33 have been
confirmed.

El Salvador: State of Emergency Declared in 4 Provinces
----------------------------------------------------------
President Francisco Flores has declared a state of emergency in 4 of El
Salvador's 14 provinces due to a dengue fever outbreak that has caused 4
deaths among 1042 reported cases. "We are declaring a state of emergency in
San Salvador, La Libertad, Santa Ana and Cabanas Departments," Flores said
late on Thu 13 Jun 2002. The state of emergency places the Defense Ministry
in charge of efforts to combat the spread of the epidemic, and frees up
state funds to help affected populations.
Health authorities said that between January and the first week of June
2002, 1042 Salvadorans have contracted dengue fever, 90 of them developing
the more dangerous form -- dengue hemorrhagic fever. So far 4 people have died.
Carried by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, dengue fever causes intense
headaches, vomiting, and muscle and joint pains. In fatal cases, victims
often do not recognize that they are infected and fail to seek proper
treatment. They quickly lose blood plasma and go into shock after the
initial fever passes.

Sri Lanka: More Dengue Fever Cases Reported
-------------------------------------------
COLOMBO: Dengue fever has spread in Sri Lanka with over 2000 confirmed
cases identified in May 2002 and 15 deaths reported, according to the
Health Ministry on Mon 17 Jun 2002. A further 3400 suspected cases of
dengue fever have been reported from different parts of the country since
the beginning of this year with 35 cases in Colombo city.
The epidemic reached its height in 2000 when over 6000 suspected cases were
hospitalized throughout the country and 35 lives were lost. The highest
number of Dengue cases this year have been reported from the Gampaha
district near the capital Colombo.
The Epidemiological unit has called for immediate steps to prevent the
killer disease spreading. An awareness program has been launched regarding
the fever itself and preventive measures are to be adopted. The change in
weather patterns and heavy rains after a long spell of drought is
considered one of the causes for the spread of the fever enabling the
mosquitos to breed freely.
