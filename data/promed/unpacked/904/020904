A mild form of bird flu has broken out in Lower Saxony. Avian influenza virus subtype H7 has been detected in 2 turkey farms in the district of Osnaburg. This was confirmed by the Ministry of Agriculture on Thu 18 Apr 2013. All 27 000 turkeys in these farms must now be culled.

There should not be human health risk by this mild form of avian flu.

[Subtyping of the neuraminidase component of the virus is expected.

As to the human health risk: in view of the recent experience in China, when an LPAI H7 virus strain has been found clearly zoonotic, it deserves to be addressed with caution. Those handling the infected turkeys would probably be liable to clinical follow-up, such as conjunctivitis as possibly reflecting infection.

Another avian influenza outbreak has recently been reported on turkey farms in Suffolk, UK (see ProMED-mail 20130418.1655382). Initially, H5 and H7 have been excluded; subtyping results and the demonstrated pathogenicity rate, are pending. - Mod.AS
