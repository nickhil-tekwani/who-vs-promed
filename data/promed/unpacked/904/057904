There are 4 confirmed H1N1 patients at Shifa International Hospital Islamabad, 1 at CMH [Combined Military Hospital] Rawalpindi and 2 at POF Hospital Wah. 1 at POF hospital Wah Rawalpindi has expired. With the upsurge of cold in some areas of Pakistan, cases of respiratory tract infections are on rise. In response to the request for information by ProMED-mail regarding the rise of ARI [acute respiratory infection] cases in Rawalpindi [Punjab province], a team of epidemiologists also visited the twin hospitals in Rawalpindi and conducted a survey in paediatric wards. The condition seems to be normal as compared to previous years data during cold months.

1) 7 samples of H1N1 pdm09 have been confirmed out of 10 samples received from Bacha Khan Medical Complex Swabi [Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province] in last 15 days. Samples have been confirmed by NIH [National Institute of Health] Islamabad. All the cases are stable and are under treatment. Infectious disease specialist Dr Amjad is treating all the cases.

2) 3 cases of H1N1 pdm09 have been confirmed from Shifa International Hospital Islamabad. Two of them are critical and are in medical ICU. Contacts have been listed and are under observation.

Virus changes -- peak season for influenza may continue into winter break
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Influenza A virus H1N1 has developed a new power. The latest surveillance from Shanghai Center for Disease Control & Prevention found that Shanghai has already entered the peak winter-spring season for influenza. From the end of November [2015], Shanghai influenza virus has changed from influenza A3 virus to A(H1N1). ...

Surveillance shows that A(H1N1) influenza has gradually become the predominant strain circulating [in Shanghai] in December [2015].

US flu activity low, with H1N1 back on the scene and 1 novel case
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Though overall flu activity in the United States is still low, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) today [18 Dec 2015] reported some new developments, including the 2009 H1N1 virus nudging ahead as the predominant strain for the week and the recent detection of a variant H1N1 (H1N1v) case in Minnesota.

Though it's too early to tell how the flu season will play out, periods when the 2009 H1N1 virus dominates can have a greater impact on younger adults and older children, whereas the H3N2 strain is toughest on older people. Results from public health labs last week showed, that among influenza A viruses, 56.7 per cent were 2009 H1N1, 36.7 per cent were H3N2, and 6.7 per cent were unsubtyped.

The numbers were small, however, with only 17 2009 H1N1 and 11 H3N2 isolates confirmed during the week. And H3N2 continues to vastly dominate for the season, constituting 72.4 per cent of 467 influenza A samples, versus 22.3 per cent for H1N1.

Minnesota's H1N1v case-patient lived and worked near swine but didn't have direct contact with them, CDC said. The patient wasn't hospitalized and has recovered, and so far no human-to-human transmission has been detected.

At the national level, flu markers remained low, with the percentage of clinic visits for flulike illness rising slightly, from 1.8 per cent to 1.9 per cent, but still below the national baseline of 2.1 per cent. No pediatric flu deaths were reported, keeping the total at 3 so far this season, and the overall percentage of deaths from flu and pneumonia were below the seasonal baselines.

South Carolina was the only state to report high flu activity, another measure of clinic visits for the disease. Guam was the only area to report widespread geographic spread of flu, with just Puerto Rico, Maryland, and New Hampshire reporting regional spread.

One of 25 2009 H1N1 samples tested for antiviral resistance, none showed resistance to oseltamivir.

[These cases are most likely influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus (pH1N1). H1N1 was 1st detected in 2009 when it was called "swine flu" because the virus was similar to viruses found in pigs. From 2009-2010, this virus caused a pandemic that claimed several hundred lives. The H1N1 virus is currently a seasonal flu virus found in humans. The virus can spread from human to human. Symptoms of swine flu in people are similar to the symptoms of regular human flu and include fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, headache, chills and fatigue.
