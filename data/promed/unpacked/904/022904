Farmers from the villages Belovitsa, Malo Krusevo and Krasnovo blocked this morning for about 2 hours the road to Plovdiv and Strelcha. Protesters want to get the cattle vaccines against nodular dermatitis [Lumpy skin disease, LSD], the earliest. This infectious cow disease was discovered in Belovitsa, where 82 cows and calves were killed and buried on 7 May 2016.

"The state is doing everything possible. In addition to the 1st consignment of 150 000 vaccine doses, 170 000 additional doses of the vaccine will arrive on 16 May and will be immediately applied. I met personally with the protesters and explained to them, but they have a right to worry about the health of the animals, because the movement of the disease is uncontrollable. We do not know how this occurs and where, but what the state is currently doing is adequate and as quickly as possible, "said the head of the Regional Directorate of the Agency for Food, Dr. Kamen Yankov.

According to him, the 1st batch of the vaccine was introduced on the 15th day since the announcement of the disease. The 2nd phase of vaccination will be after 16 May. Other animals in the village Belovitsa will not be killed, said Dr. Yankov. "We have no grounds," he said. On Monday [9 May 2016] it found a suspected case in the village of Trilistnik, confirmed Dr. Yankov. In his words, a sample was taken from the cow, the results of which will become clear on Tuesday [10 May 2016].

[On Mon 9 May 2016, Bulgaria submitted to the OIE a report concerning 2 new LSD outbreaks, on its border with Greece; see, with map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=20114.
The said report does not include information on applied vaccination.

The cummulative Bulgarian LSD epidemiological statistics since the reported start of the event on 12 Apr 2016, are the following:
Total outbreaks = 17 (Submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 589 / 20 / 0 / 589 / 0

Due to the restrictive measures adopted in connection with the spread of LSD, no sheep and goat exhibitions were held during the festive 5th jubilee of the National Meeting of Sheep Breeders in Bulgaria. The remarkable event took place on 6-8 May 2016, close to the Petropavelski Monastery region, near the town of Lyaskovets. Despite the unfavourable weather conditions, more than 100 000 people attended. The different animal species were presented in alternative methods, such as a special photo exhibition (see, with picture, at http://tinyurl.com/znh92qu).

On 6 May 2016, Bulgaria's western neighbor, FYR [Former Yugoslavia Republic] Macedonia, reported 3 new outbreaks of LSD; see, with map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=20148.

According to a Dutch source, the entire transport of cattle from Europe to Turkey has been discontinued, since the only route passes through the infected zone in Bulgaria. Returning lorries may carry the virus (and/or infected arthropods?) back to other European countries. (see -- in Dutch -- at http://veeteelt.nl/gezondheid/nieuws/lumpy-skin-disease-rukt-verder-op-naar-noorden?device=3&device_type=0).

In Greece, LSD has resumed its spread in 2016, also in hitherto unaffected areas. The "emergency vaccination" in late 2015 was applied only in regions already affected, not preventively in neighboring and other areas. - Mod.AS
