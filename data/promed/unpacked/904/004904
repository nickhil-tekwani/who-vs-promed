Serbia reported bovine outbreaks in 2008 and 2011; their outbreaks in 2012 were not placed. ProMED report 20120105.1000977 relates to a series of livestock and human cases in fact in 2011, but published in 2012, and were in Vojvodina in the north. This disease is very sporadic in Serbia, and vaccination is only as needed. - Mod.MHJ
