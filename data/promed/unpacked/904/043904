Shrimp 'look sick,' but remain safe to eat
-------------------------
Many, if not most, South Carolina shrimp have caught black gill syndrome,
biologists say, and shrimp fishermen are worried the parasite, also called
black spot, may be killing their catch.
"I don't want to sound like an alarmist, but in all my years, I've never
seen anything like it," said Jimmy Leland, who owns a commercial dock and
shrimp boat in McClellanville and has spent 35 years in the shrimp
business. "What shrimp I've seen, especially inshore, are weak, and some
are dead when you catch them," he said. "The shrimp just look sick. They
are not acting right."
Infection rates are 80 to 90 percent, said David Whitaker, director of the
Office of Fisheries Management at the S.C. Department of Natural Resources
(DNR).
The shrimp are safe to eat, and most people discard the heads, where the
affected gills are found, said Whitaker. The parasite turns gills black and
hardens them so shrimp can't breathe well. As it grows, a shrimp molts its
infected gills but is quickly reinfected, he said.
Department biologists first saw the syndrome in 1999, and it has reappeared
annually. "This is the first time we have seen it cause this big an
infection," Whitaker said. "It's ubiquitous in the creeks and ocean."
"It's definitely becoming a pretty serious problem," said Rutledge Leland,
co-owner of Carolina Seafood in McClellanville. "We are being turned down
on sales because of it. ... It's ugly." He usually sells a lot of heads-on
shrimp to Oriental and other markets, he said. "They don't like the
appearance." Processing Plants that remove heads and peel shrimp don't mind
and are still buying, he added.
Many shrimp baiters would not even notice the parasite, especially if they
cast on muddy bottoms and shrimp come up looking a muddy brown, Jimmy
Leland said. Experienced cast netters working the Bull's Bay and
McClellanville area report 3/4 of their catch has black spot, he said.
Leland is talking with DNR about the parasite this week. He serves on DNR's
Marine Advisory Committee and on the South Atlantic Fishery Advisory
Council's Shrimp Advisory Committee.
"Something is killing the white shrimp big time," Leland wrote DNR Director
Paul Sandifer. "I took my boat out yesterday and caught shrimp that had
been dead and were already turning pink. I don't mean just a few either.
Almost all of the shrimp inshore have black spot and are either dead or
dying. I hear the same thing up and down the coast. Can anyone tell us what
is going on? This is serious!"
Sandifer responded immediately, said Leland, adding that he offered to take
DNR staff out on a shrimping boat to get samples and see sick and dying shrimp.
"We are anxious to get out on boats and see," said Whitaker, who sent out
word to fishermen Monday. Bad weather kept shrimpers in port Tuesday.
Samples collected within the last 2 weeks will go to Gulf Coast Research
Lab in Pascagoula, Mississippi., which previously identified the parasite.
"We are trying to find out if this is causing mortality," Whitaker said.
"Shrimpers are saying it is. We have not found any dead or dying shrimp in
rivers, creeks or the ocean." If an animal's gills are impaired and it
can't breathe, it is going to have problems, Whitaker added.
"This is urgent, I believe," said Clay Cable, vice president of the S.C.
Shrimpers Association. Cable is trying to find out how far the South
Carolina problem has spread. Leland reports shrimp have the syndrome from
Georgetown to Sapelo Island, Geogia.
"It's not a good prospect," said Ben Gregg, chairman of the state Marine
Advisory Committee. "I am very concerned." Gregg points to development,
drought and other stress on shellfish and the coastal environment. "It's
also an economic concern," he said. "Commercial folks are dependent on
shrimp staying fresh 3 or 4 days. ... These are dying quickly after they
are caught so it is difficult to get them to market."
So little is known about black gill syndrome, Gregg and Whitaker said.
"This is like a flu epidemic. There isn't a whole lot we can do. We can't
treat it. All we can do is document it," Whitaker said.
Gregg added, "This could be the worst of it or just the beginning."

[Black gill syndrome is also known as Black gill disease, Burned gills,
Black spot disease, and Branchiostegite melanization. It is a manifestation
of a number of disease syndromes including ascorbic acid deficiency.
Generally there are multifocal black or brown spots in, or general
discoloration of, the gills, due to melanization at sites of tissue
necrosis. Gill melanization may be visible through the side of the
carapace. There is massive hemocyte accumulation or inflammation, tissue
necrosis, and melanin deposition in affected areas of gills. Secondary
infections of bacteria, fungi, and protozoa may occur.
The syndrome appears to be ubiquitous, but because not much is known about
it, outbreaks are difficult to predict and control. - Mod.TG]
