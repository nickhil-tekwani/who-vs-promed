A man in central China has died as a result of avian influenza virus
infection, the official Xinhua news agency said on Thu 20 Apr 2006,
reporting the country's 12th H5N1 virus death since November 2005.
The World Health Organisation (WHO), which has not confirmed the
death was from avian influenza, said the Chinese authorities had
informed it that the man had died on Wed 19 Apr 2006. "The source of
exposure is under investigation," WHO spokeswoman Maria Cheng said in Geneva.
There have been more than 30 outbreaks in poultry in a dozen
provinces over the past year in China, making it one of the countries
worst-hit by a virus that has spread with surprising speed this year,
with outbreaks [in poultry] in more than 30 countries.
Xinhua, quoting local health authorities, identified the victim as a
21-year-old migrant worker who worked as a security guard in Wuhan,
capital of the central province of Hubei. It said he had returned to
his home outside Wuhan last month to attend a funeral and developed
symptoms of pneumonia on 1 Apr 2006. On Tuesday the Health Ministry
had confirmed that he had [contracted] H5N1 virus, making him the
country's 17th human case. Xinhua said people who had close contact
with the man had shown no abnormal symptoms. It added that there were
no reports of avian influenza outbreaks among poultry in his home
town and the reason for his infection was unknown. "As with all human
cases in China where we haven't first seen H5N1 in animals, this
points to a gap in surveillance which we would like to see resolved,"
said the WHO's Cheng.

With the high interest in the news report from Lampung of a suspected
cluster of avian influenza virus cases [see part (4) of the
ProMED-mail post archived as "Avian influenza, human - worldwide
(49): China, Indonesia, Pakistan, Sudan 20060419.1150"] we want to
caution that the news report contained inaccuracies. The Ministry of
Health may report more fully, but in brief, the full investigation
has ruled out H5 as a cause of illness in this cluster in Lampung.
Epidemiological data also did not support an H5 etiology. Other
diagnoses for this cluster appear far more likely.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) confirmed on Fri 21 Apr 2006 that
there have been 12 human cases of bird flu in Egypt, 4 of them fatal.
This took the global total to 113 deaths out of 204 cases since 2003,
the United Nations agency said.
Egyptian officials had previously announced all 12 cases, including
the 4th fatality, an 18-year-old girl from a province north of Cairo
who died a week ago. In a statement, the WHO said one of its
collaborating laboratories in Britain had now "fully validated" the
test results obtained in Egypt.
The highly pathogenic H5N1 virus was detected in birds in Egypt in
February 2006 and the first human infection was reported in
mid-March. All 4 victims have been women, who are often responsible
for slaughtering and cooking domestic poultry.
"Of the 12 cases in Egypt, 4 patients have died and one remains
hospitalised in stable condition," the WHO said. The remaining 7
patients had fully recovered, it added.
On Thursday, the WHO said a man in neighbouring Sudan suspected to
have bird flu had now tested negative.
