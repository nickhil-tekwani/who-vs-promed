[From January to August 2017, 14 outbreaks of EIA were reported in Germany. These outbreaks were located in the provinces of Bayern/Bavaria (3), Niedersachsen/Lower Saxony (2), Nordhein-Westfalen/North Rhine-Westphalia (3), Hamburg (3), Schleswig-Holstein (1), and Baden-Wurttemberg (2). A total of 20 cases were diagnosed from a susceptible population of 359 animals (equidae). All affected animals (cases) were destroyed. The event was resolved in November 2017. See event summary report and map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=22410.

"Equine infectious anemia (EIA) is a retroviral disease of equids that may be characterized by acute and/or chronic recurring clinical signs, including fever, anemia, edema, and cachexia in some animals. Many horses have very mild or inapparent signs on 1st exposure and carry this virus subclinically. The owners of these animals are unlikely to realize that they are infected unless serological testing is done. All infected horses, including those that are asymptomatic, become carriers and are infectious for life. Infected animals must either be destroyed or remain permanently isolated from other equids to prevent transmission.

There is no evidence that equine infectious anemia is a threat to humans." (http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/equine_infectious_anemia.pdf).- Mod.CRD
