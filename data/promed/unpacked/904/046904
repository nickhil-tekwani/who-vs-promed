[A viral root rot caused by _Cassava brown streak virus_ (CBSV) as
well as cassava mosaic disease (CMD) caused by a number of species of
_Begomovirus_ are known to affect the crop in Uganda. In addition, an
undiagnosed fungal disease was also reported from the country in 2010
(see ProMED-mail post 20100101.0009). Either of these diseases could
be the cause of the problems reported above.

For more information on CBSV and CMD see links and previous posts
listed below.
