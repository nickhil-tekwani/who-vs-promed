Wyoming: Hepatitis B Outbreak in the Casper Area
------------------------------------------------
City of Casper, Natrona County and state health officials stated on Tue 24
Jun 2003 that 57 people have contracted hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C
virus infection, or both [?], in the Casper area since late February and
the number infected will continue to climb. City/County Health Director Bob
Harrington said he decided to make the outbreak public amid concerns it
will continue to spread through sex, contact with blood or body fluids or
intravenous drug use. "Anybody who thinks they might have any risk at all
should come in and get tested," Harrington said.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is sending a prevention
expert to Casper to provide support, according to a release from the
Wyoming Department of Health. Hepatitis B virus is a liver virus that
causes jaundice, abdominal pain and nausea, among other symptoms. Of those
infected, 30 percent show no signs or symptoms, according to the CDC.
Harrington said 8 infected patients have checked into the hospital with
"crushing fatigue" since the outbreak began. There were 59 confirmed
hepatitis B cases in Natrona County from 1999 to 2002. In all of Wyoming,
there were 88 cases of hepatitis B in 2002. The number of hepatitis C
patients was much higher, reaching 408 in Wyoming in 2002. Hepatitis B is a
greater concern because it is easily transmitted through sexual contact,
whereas hepatitis C is generally only transmitted through blood, said Clay
Van Houten, Hepatitis Coordinator for the state Health Department. The CDC
team is curious to see which of the hepatitis B strains is infecting
Casper, Van Houten said.
Hepatitis C virus, a liver virus not related to hepatitis B virus, can lay
dormant for long periods of time. Many of those infected with hepatitis B
virus may have been carrying hepatitis C virus for a while, Harrington
said. "In combination they make for a much more serious illness,"
Harrington said. Health department officials have been tracking patients
and their contacts. Harrington said officials are investigating another 30
people who may have been exposed. "We get new cases coming into health care
facilities regularly," he said.
City/County health officials will start giving the hepatitis B vaccine for
free, or a suggested donation [there is no hepatitis C vaccine - Mod.CP].
Since 1 Mar 2003, the county has given 778 shots to children from 0 to 8
years old and 156 to those older than 19, he said. The vaccine does not
have serious side effects, according to the CDC. Vaccination has been given
to infants since 1996 and is mandatory for [those] attending school and day
care. Casper firefighters, health-care workers, Natrona County sheriff
deputies and others who deal with medical emergencies have also been
vaccinated.
Ken McBain, the chief executive officer of the Community Health Center of
Central Wyoming, said doctors at that facility had not seen a spike in
reports of the illness. Health officials encourage people at risk to see
their doctor or go to the City/County Health Department for confidential
advice, free-of-charge testing and vaccination.

[The number of cases reported in the past 5 months is almost equal to the
number recorded during the entire period 1999 to 2002 in Natrona County.
The reason for vaccination of children in addition to young adults, and the
extent of the involvement of hepatitis C virus infection, are unclear.
Further information on the epidemiology of this outbreak would be welcomed.
