Three children found a bat which they left at the Humane Society
after it died last Tuesday. It was determined the cause of death
was rabies. The Larimer County Department of Health has located
all people who had contact with the bat (3 children, 1 adult) and
determined they are at no risk since there was no salivary contact.
A second bat was found by 2 other children who were not so lucky.
They had carried the dead bat home in their T-shirts to show it to
friends. They will be receiving the rabies vaccine series as
preventitive prophylaxis for their possible exposure.
A third rabid bat was found in Fort Collins (just north of Loveland,
home of Colorado State University) on Monday when a homeowner
caught their dog chewing on it. Since the dog is current on its
rabies vaccinations it will not be euthanized.
Rabies is spread through salivary contact, attacks the immune
system and is always fatal unless the vaccine is given in time.
Symptoms of rabies include disorientation, difficulty swallowing,
altered behavior, paralysis and death.
