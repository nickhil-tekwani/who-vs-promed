The number of hepatitis A cases in Roanoke [Virginia, USA] sits at 76 since the beginning of January [2022]. Billy's Restaurant in downtown Roanoke had the most recent case on Friday [15 Jul 2022]. A waitress told WDBJ7 on Monday [18 Jul 2022] that the restaurant is offering all employees free hepatitis A vaccines after Friday's [15 Jul 2022] case. The Virginia Department of Health stated because the infected employee didn't handle food, customers who ate at the restaurant aren't at risk. This is the 4th restaurant in the Roanoke Health District to have a positive case of hepatitis A.

The district health director for Roanoke City and Allegheny Health districts explained the community is seeing an epidemic. "We are definitely in an epidemic," Cynthia Morrow said. "The term 'outbreak' is more specific when you can identify the specific time frames, locations and subgroups, so outbreaks are types of epidemics."

Because hepatitis A is a fecal-orally transmitted disease that can spread through ingestion and close contact, a food safety lawyer said, explaining how outbreaks at restaurants can be dangerous and deadly. "It's likely that in the one-week period of time the employee is infectious, that restaurant may have thousands of patrons," Bill Marler said.

In the fall of 2021, Famous Anthony's [a restaurant in Roanoke] had a hepatitis A outbreak that led to 4 deaths and 49 positive cases among customers.

The health department previously saw 2 to 4 cases of hepatitis A per year, but now cases have gone up to 2 to 4 cases per week. Morrow explained there is a direct correlation between the rise in drug usage and the rise in hepatitis A cases. "Those who have had a history of drug abuse don't always have access to proper hygiene like showers and soap," Morrow said. "Unfortunately, once hepatitis A is embedded in the community, it is really challenging to get back to our baseline."

Dr Anthony Baffoe-Bonnie, infectious disease clinician at Carilion Clinic, explained the best way to protect yourself is by washing your hands often and getting vaccinated. "If you stay in a community where there is high transmission of hepatitis A, and you have not received a hepatitis A vaccine, I think it's a no-brainer to look into that with your primary doctor," Baffoe-Bonnie said.

The health department is offering free doses of the hepatitis A vaccine Tuesday [19 Jul 2022] at the Roanoke Health Department at 1513 Williamson Road, NE Roanoke, from 11 a.m. until 2 p.m. In a statement, the health department said the vaccination clinic is being held out of an abundance of caution from the rise in recent cases.

[Since the hepatitis A virus (HAV) outbreak in the state of Virginia was reported on 1 Jan 2019, as of 5 Jul 2022 there have been 728 cases in the outbreak cohort (intravenous substances users, homeless people) with 451 (62%) hospitalizations and 6 deaths. Nationwide, as of 5 Jul 2022, there have been a total of 44 709 cases with 27 347 (61%) hospitalizations and 423 deaths since the outbreak involving 37 states was first reported in California in November 2016 (https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/outbreaks/2017March-HepatitisA.htm).

To prevent restaurant-associated outbreaks from occurring, although still not mandated or even advocated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (ref), food handlers can be immunized against hepatitis A virus (HAV). In the USA, HAV immunization is part of the routine pediatric vaccination program, but this only began in 2006 so many adults in the USA remain susceptible.
