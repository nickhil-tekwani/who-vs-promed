We have faced a similar problem as reported about Leishmaniasis in dogs
(Canine Leishmaniasis, CanL) in Pennsylvania in North-West Italy at the
feet of the Alps. Cases of CanL were reported by colleagues from veterinary
cabinets in dogs that had never moved from the area.
Apparently no known vectors were present in an area more than 150 Km far
from the coastal zone where sand flies and CanL are reported. After 3
months of sand flies capture we found _Phlebotomus perniciosus_, a major
vector of CanL in Italy, in an area 7x8 Km wide.
It is very difficult to say if sand flies are autochthonous in the area or
are were accidentally introduced by humans activities. Has anyone
identified the species of _Leishmania_ involved in the outbreak? It would
be of great help to understand the source of infection and which species of
vector can be involved.
I suggest you test with the ELISA K39 all the dogs in the focus area and
you may want to start your search for sand flies immediately with the
coming of the warm weather. (Pennsylvania climatic conditions seems to be
similar to the one in North-West Italy, so you can expect to find sand
flies for the second half of June).

_Leishmania donovani's_ life history is quite involved and host specific.
In the Indian epidemics, the particular sandflies (Silvery Sandly or
_Phlebotomus argentipes_) involved need to feed on a particular type of
nectar or fruit juice (raisins were used in the lab) to permit the
protozoan's life cycle to proceed.
It took 38 years to prove this with many false and embarassing trails (e.g.
bed bugs). There is a wonderful account of this in Dr Robert Desowitz's
book "The Malaria Capers" for those who may be interested.
One would think that the conditions must be absolutely on target for _L.
donovani_ to become established in sandflies in the US. In spite of this,
some veterinarians have suggested the disease could be brought to this
country by reptile intermediate hosts. In the absence of the right kinds of
flies and conditions, its jump to humans is not very likely or is it?

With all the discussion going on about leishmaniasis in dogs, wouldn't it
be reasonable to expect that, if the parasite were really there, and being
transmitted by sandflies, then there should also eventually be cases of
human infection? Or are there species/strains of _Leishmania_ which are
purely zoophilic?
