The United Kingdom and Italy have in recent days sounded an alarm about a new disease with possible links to novel coronavirus. France has more than a dozen cases of children with inflammation around the heart after Britain sounded an alarm about a new disease with possible links to novel coronavirus. French health minister Olivier Veran said there was not enough evidence to confirm a link with the coronavirus sweeping the globe, but France was taking the cases "very seriously."

Britain's state-run National Health Service issued the alert at the weekend about a small number of children presenting an unusual set of symptoms, including abdominal pain and inflammation that required admission to intensive care. In London, health minister Matt Hancock on Tuesday [28 Apr 2020] spoke of "early signs that in rare cases, there is an impact of an auto-immune response in children that causes a significant disease. It's a new disease that we think may be caused by coronavirus and the COVID-19 virus," he said.

But he said that while some of the children who have it tested positive for the virus, others did not. Cases have also been reported in Italy, Spain, and Switzerland, Mr Veran told Franceinfo news radio, adding he had received an alert from Paris concerning "about 15 children of all ages."

"To my knowledge, fortunately no child has died from these complications, which are fairly rare illnesses that can come with inflammation of the heart," Mr Veran said (see following media report in section [2]).

Some of the cases "in France as in England, but not all, have turned out to carry the coronavirus," causing "some concern and watchfulness."
"I am taking this very seriously. We have absolutely no medical explanation at this stage. Is it an inflammatory reaction that sets off a pre-existing condition in children who have this virus, or is it another infectious disease? There are a lot of questions."

Mr Veran urged international and French experts to gather as much data as possible to establish if a link can be made between the coronavirus and the new symptoms, "which until now had not been seen anywhere."

France intends to re-open primary schools from [11 May 2020], and the minister noted that children had largely escaped COVID-19 infection and that serious cases involved those with underlying conditions.

A rare inflammatory syndrome that researchers believe to be linked to COVID-19 is a concern, although it has not led to any deaths of children in the United Kingdom so far, Britain's health ministry said on Tuesday [28 Apr 2020].

Italian and British medical experts are investigating a possible link between the coronavirus pandemic and clusters of severe inflammatory disease among infants who are arriving in hospitals with high fevers and swollen arteries.

Doctors in northern Italy, one of the world's hardest-hit areas during the pandemic, have reported extraordinarily large numbers of children under age 9 with severe cases of what appears to be Kawasaki disease, more common in parts of Asia.

Asked about the syndrome on LBC, Hancock appeared to say that some children with no underlying health conditions had died from it. But the British health ministry later clarified that he had been speaking about COVID-19 more generally. "We are not aware of any confirmed cases of children dying from this syndrome," a ministry spokesman said. "The minister did not say that there are confirmed cases of children dying from this syndrome."

Hancock had said the condition was a new disease believed to have been caused by coronavirus and the COVID-19 virus. "We're not 100% sure because some of the people who got it hadn't tested positive, so we're doing a lot of research now, but it is something that we're worried about," Hancock said.

Children were until now thought to be much less susceptible than their parents or grandparents to the most deadly complications wrought by the novel coronavirus, though the mysterious inflammatory disease noticed in Britain, Spain, and Italy may demand a reassessment. "It is rare, although it is very significant for those children who do get it; the number of cases is small," Hancock, one of the ministers leading Britain's COVID-19 response, said.

Kawasaki disease, whose cause is unknown, is associated with fever, skin rashes, swelling of glands, and in severe cases, inflammation of arteries of the heart. Britain's National Health Service says the syndrome only affects about 8 in every 100 000 children every year, with most aged under 5. There is some evidence that individuals can inherit a predisposition to the disease, but the pattern is not clear.

Children either testing positive for COVID-19 or for its antibodies have presented gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea in the last 2 weeks, the Spanish Pediatric Association said on Monday [27 Apr 2020]. Though the children were otherwise in good health, their condition could evolve within hours into shock, featuring tachycardia and hypotension even without fever.

Most cases were detected in school-age or teenage minors, and sometimes overlapped with Kawasaki disease or toxic shock syndrome (TSS). Parents should be vigilant, junior British interior minister Victoria Atkins said. "It demonstrates just how fast moving this virus is and how unprecedented it is in its effect," Atkins told Sky News.

Several children in the United States who tested positive for the coronavirus have also experienced a rare inflammatory condition, similar to one health officials in Europe have recently warned about, according to a report from Reuters.

A specialist who treated the 3 children at Columbia University Medical Center in New York told the outlet the patients, ranging in age from 6 months to 8 years, experienced fever and inflammation of the heart and gut.

"Right now, we're at the very beginning of trying to understand what that represents," Columbia's Mark Gorelik, a pediatric rheumatologist and immunologist, told Reuters. Gorelik was called in to evaluate whether the cases were Kawasaki disease, a rare childhood illness that causes the walls of blood vessels in the body to become inflamed. Gorelik told the outlet the cases are likely not Kawasaki disease, but a similar process that shares an underlying mechanism with the disease.

The cases in New York come after a report from Stanford University, where a 6-month-old who was hospitalized with Kawasaki disease later tested positive for COVID-19. [Jones VG, Mills M, Suarez D, et al. COVID-19 and Kawasaki disease: novel virus and novel case. Hosp Pediatr. 2020; doi: 10.1542/hpeds.2020-0123. (https://hosppeds.aappublications.org/content/early/2020/04/06/hpeds.2020-0123)]. While the cause of Kawasaki disease is unknown, several pathogens have been suggested as a possible trigger, including some coronaviruses, Reuters reports.

The report comes after Britain's Paediatric Intensive Care Society issued an alert from the National Health Service (NHS) England to doctors earlier this week, explaining in the past three weeks there has been an increase in the number of children with "a multi-system inflammatory state requiring intensive care," in London and other parts of the country. The health group said there was growing concern that a COVID-19-related syndrome was emerging in children, "or that there may be another as yet unidentified infectious pathogen associated with these cases."

"The cases have in common overlapping features of toxic shock syndrome and atypical Kawasaki disease with blood parameters consistent with severe COVID-19 in children," the statement said. "Abdominal pain and gastrointestinal symptoms have been a common feature as has cardiac inflammation." Health officials said some of these children had tested positive for COVID-19, while some had not. Similar warnings have come from health officials in Spain and Italy, with Italian physicians reporting an unusual increase in the number of patients with Kawasaki disease, including some children who had COVID-19 or had contact with confirmed cases.

The virus that causes COVID-19 has largely spared children, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said children diagnosed with coronavirus typically experience mild cases.

[4] WHO investigating
Date: Wed 29 Apr 2020

The World Health Organization is investigating whether the coronavirus causes some children to develop a rare inflammatory disease, WHO officials said Wednesday [29 Apr 2020].

Health officials in the U.K. warned doctors over the weekend that COVID-19 could be causing a rare inflammatory condition in children. Britain's Pediatric Intensive Care Society said Monday [27 Apr 2020] the National Health Service alerted it to a small number of critically ill children presenting with "an unusual clinical picture."

The society noted that many -- but not all -- of the children with symptoms of the new inflammatory disease had been diagnosed with COVID-19. The condition was likened to toxic shock syndrome and Kawasaki disease. "We are aware of this report that came out of the United Kingdom about a small number of cases amongst children with this inflammatory response," WHO's lead scientist on COVID-19, Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, said Wednesday [29 Apr 2020]. "We're looking at this with our clinical network."

Toxic shock syndrome is a rare, life-threatening condition caused by bacteria getting into the body and releasing harmful toxins. Symptoms include a high temperature, a sunburn-like rash, and flu-like symptoms such as a headache and sore throat. Kawasaki disease causes swelling of the heart's blood vessels and mainly affects children under the age of 5, according to the UK's NHS. Symptoms include a rash, swollen glands in the neck, dry or cracked lips, and red fingers or toes. The Mayo Clinic says it is usually treatable.

It remains unclear what the relationship is between COVID-19 and the inflammatory conditions, but Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, told reporters Monday [27 Apr 2020] it is "entirely plausible" that COVID-19 causes the illness. "There are some recent rare descriptions of children in some European countries that have had this inflammatory syndrome, which is similar to the Kawasaki syndrome," Van Kerkhove said. "But it seems to be very rare."

The WHO has asked its global network of clinicians to be "on alert" for such cases around the world. The coronavirus, which is primarily a respiratory disease, is affecting more than just the lungs, as 1st thought, said Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO's emergencies program. "Obviously it's causing inflammation and attacks tissue other than lung tissue," he said. "We are in a situation where clinicians are looking at what those other effects of having this coronavirus infection are."

It's "very important" that researchers look further into such reports to better understand the nature of the virus and the disease it causes, Ryan said. He added that the condition remains very rare.

"Kawasaki syndrome is a syndrome that's been around for a long time," he said. "It's a rare condition. It happens. It usually resolves itself." The WHO emphasized the condition appears to be rare.

[It appears as though we are now in a "seek and ye shall find" mode of trying to further identify this syndrome and further define if this is yet another syndrome on the spectrum of COVID-19 presentations. Fortunately, it appears as though this is relatively rare, but countries are starting to look for this in their pediatric populations.

More information on this syndrome and identification of cases in other countries would be greatly appreciated, as well as further viral laboratory results, especially in children with negative PCRs for the SARS-CoV-2. - Mod.MPP
