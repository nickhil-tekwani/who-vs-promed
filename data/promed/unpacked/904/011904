The potential case of bird flu was identified in the Kgatleng district of Botswana. The country's ministry of agriculture has banned the movement of live birds, eggs, meat, and feathers within and out of the Bokaa area to contain the outbreak.

Poultry producers are also being told to improve biosecurity protocols in their facilities and prevent contact between poultry and wild birds.
