Tak Province Husbandry Bureau announced yesterday [2 Oct 2015] that Mae Sot Cattle Market would be temporarily closed. This is Thailand's largest market for exports of yellow cattle and water buffalo to China. But recently a strange infectious disease has appeared in the market causing the feet and mouths of many cattle to rot, and even death. The local authorities are unable to control the outbreak and could only suspend trading.

The Animal Husbandry Bureau said yesterday [2 Oct 2015] that they would temporarily close Mae Sot Cattle Market because many cattle have been infected with a strange illness recently causing feet and mouths to rot with some deaths.

Local authorities are now unable to control or treat the illness, and are concerned that if the diseased cattle move to other places the outbreak will spread. So, they temporarily closed the market for a week. Once the authorities control the outbreak it will reopen.

Local reporters have said that in an effort to cut expenses, cattle traders have moved cattle from neighboring countries into Thailand, and these cattle have not undergone inspections. It is very likely that they carry illness. Investigations found that there are 10 such black markets in Tak Province.

Local authorities say that they will request experts to research a vaccine and do their best to curb expansion of the outbreak to reduce losses and return to cattle trading as quickly as possible. At the same time, they will seriously investigate some of the black markets.

[Maps of Thailand can be seen at https://www.welt-atlas.de/datenbank/karten/karte-6-934.gif and https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=3690692,42941. Thailand has borders with the following countries: Laos, Myanmar, Cambodia, Viet Nam, and Malaysia. Tak province in north western Thailand has a long boundary with Myanmar (Burma), mainly with Kayin State.

The clinical signs as described in the report may be indicative of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), a disease endemic in Thailand and all its neighbours, as the most plausible candidate. Confirmation or otherwise is requested. In case confirmed, serotyping results and clarification of the severe (international trade related?) measures applied are requested. In case FMD is ruled out, the definite diagnosis of this event is urgently needed.

According to the statistics available at the (commendable, exemplary) regional website SEAFMD (Southeast Asia FMD; http://www.arahis.oie.int/reports.php?site=seafmd), accessed 5 Oct 2015, the following information from Thailand and Myanmar in relation to FMD is currently available for 2015:

As of October 2015, a total of 51 FMD outbreaks have been reported from Thailand, including 10 which started before 1 Jan 2015 and were regarded ongoing. Of the said 51 foci, 35 have been serotyped FMDV-O, 7 FMDV-A, 3 remain untyped and 6 were not sampled. No outbreaks have apparently been reported for August and September. It deserves to be noted that the date of the most recently submitted monthly report is not available.

Out of Thailand's 76 provinces (and the "special administrative area" Bangkok) , 16 provinces of Thailand have reported FMD during the said period. The most affected provinces were Nakhon Ratchasima (12 outbreaks), Sarabori (8), and Nakhon Si Thammarat (6). Not a single outbreak was reported from Tak province.

During the same period, Myanmar reported 9 outbreaks in 2 of its 15 main administrative subdivisions, of which 6 isolates serotyped FMDV-O and 3 not sampled. Out of the 9 outbreaks, 2 were reported for August 2015, in the Province Mandalay (both serotyped O). No outbreaks have been reported from the territories bordering Thailand -- Shan, Kayah, Kayin, and Taninthary.

The Southeast Asia Foot and Mouth Disease Campaign (SEAFMD) involves the coordinated control of foot-and-mouth disease by 8 countries in the ASEAN region. These countries are Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam. The campaign is coordinated through an OIE (Office International des Epizooties) Regional Coordination Unit in Bangkok with the generous support of the Australian Government's overseas aid program, administered by AusAID.
