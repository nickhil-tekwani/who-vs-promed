The Missouri Departments of Agriculture [MDA], Conservation [MDC] and
Health and Senior Services [DHSS] and the US Department of Agriculture
[USDA] announced late today [19 Oct 2011] that a captive white-tailed
deer in Macon County has tested positive for chronic wasting disease
[CWD], a neurological disease found in deer, elk, and moose.

"We have a plan in place and our team is actively working to ensure
that this situation is addressed quickly and effectively," said state
veterinarian Dr Linda Hickam. "Fortunately there is no evidence that
CWD poses a risk to humans, non cervid livestock, household pets, or
food safety.

"The animal that tested positive for CWD was a captive white-tailed
deer inspected as part of the state's CWD surveillance and testing
program. Preliminary tests were conducted by the USDA National
Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa.

Upon receiving the confirmed CWD positive, Missouri's departments of
agriculture, conservation and health and senior services initiated
their CWD Contingency Plan that was developed in 2002 by the Cervid
Health Committee, a task force comprised of veterinarians, animal
health officers, and conservation officers from USDA, MDA, MDC, and
DHSS working together to mitigate challenges associated with CWD.

In February 2010 a case of CWD was confirmed in Linn County on a
captive hunting preserve operated by the same entity, Heartland
Wildlife Ranches, LLC. The Linn County facility was depopulated and no
further infection was identified at that facility. The current case
was identified through increased surveillance required by the
management plan implemented from the previous CWD incident.

CWD is transmitted by live animal to animal contact or soil to animal
contact. The disease was first recognized in 1967 in captive mule deer
in the Colorado Division of Wildlife captive wildlife research
facility in Fort Collins, Colorado. CWD has been documented in deer
and/or elk in Colorado, Illinois, Kansas, Maryland, Michigan,
Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota,
Oklahoma, South Dakota, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and
the Canadian Provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. There has been no
evidence that the disease can be transmitted to humans.

"Missouri's proactive steps to put a testing protocol in place and
create a contingency plan years ago is proving beneficial. We are in a
solid position to follow pre-established steps to ensure Missouri's
valuable white-tailed deer resource remains healthy and strong," said
Jason Sumners Missouri's deer biologist, Missouri Department of
Conservation.

[The article only provides a hint that the premises may be
depopulated, as that was done at the previous captive facility with a
CWD diagnosis.

One has to wonder what risk factors were involved with this premises
for CWD to be found in a captive herd? This article does not tell us
if this herd was in a monitoring plan, but likely it was, as they did
find the disease. We just do not know how long it was monitored or how
the herd was acquired. - Mod.TG
