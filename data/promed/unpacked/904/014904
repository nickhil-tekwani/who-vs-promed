Classical swine fever, Japan
-----------------
Information received on [and dated] 5 Jul 2019 from Dr Norio Kumagai, Director, Chief Veterinary Officer, Animal Health Division, Food Safety and Consumer Affairs Bureau, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Tokyo, Japan

Report type: Follow-up report No. 31
Date of start of the event: 3 Sep 2018
Date of confirmation of the event: 5 Jul 2019, 9 Sep 2018
Report date: 5 Jul 2019
Date submitted to OIE 5 Jul 2019.

[The report presents data on 3 new outbreaks in domestic pig holdings and 71 in wild boar; for the detailed statistics related to each of the said 74 outbreaks, please refer to the source's URL.]

Epidemiological comments:
1. The 27th affected farm (Seki city in Gifu):
On 22 Jun 2019, some pigs were found to be dead or with high fever and low appetite. That was reported to the Gifu Livestock Hygiene Service Centre (LHSC). Official veterinarians of the LHSC immediately visited the farm to conduct a clinical inspection and sampling. The samples were tested for classical swine fever (CSF) virus by RT-PCR at the LHSC. The samples were found to be positive on 23 Jun 2019. On 25 Jun 2019, stamping out, disinfection of contaminated materials, tools and facilities were completed at the 27th affected farm.

2. The 28th affected farm (Nishio City in Aichi):
On 28 Jun 2019, some pigs were found to be dead or with high fever and low appetite. That was reported to the Aichi Livestock Hygiene Service Centre (LHSC). Official veterinarians of the LHSC immediately visited the farm to conduct a clinical inspection and sampling. The samples were tested for classical swine fever (CSF) virus by RT-PCR at the LHSC. The samples were found to be positive on 29 Jun 2019. The epidemiologically related farms were identified. Stamping out and disinfection of contaminated materials, tools and facilities are being carried out at the affected farm and epidemiologically related farms.

3. The 29th affected farm (Ena City in Gifu):
On 2 Jul 2019, some pigs were found to have high fever and low appetite. That was reported to the Gifu Livestock Hygiene Service Centre (LHSC). Official veterinarians of the LHSC immediately visited the farm to conduct a clinical inspection and sampling. The samples were tested for classical swine fever (CSF) virus by RT-PCR at the LHSC. The samples were found to be positive on 3 Jul 2019. Stamping out and disinfection of contaminated materials, tools and facilities are being carried out at the affected farm.

4. Lift of shipment restriction zone (SRZ) and movement restriction zone (MRZ) at 16th affected farm (Tahara City in Aichi):
- On 00:00 of 17 Jun 2019, shipment restrictions, which were established within a 3-10 km radius of the affected farm, were lifted as 17 days had passed after the completion of full implementation of control measures (stamping out, disinfection etc.) and all the results of active surveillance program to lift shipment restriction zone (SRZ) and movement restriction zone (MRZ) were negative.

- On 00:00 of 21 Jun 2019, shipment restrictions, which were established within a 3-10 km radius of the affected farm and movement restrictions, which were established within a 3 km radius of the affected farm, were lifted as 28 days had passed after the completion of full implementation of control measures (stamping out, disinfection etc.) and all the results of the active surveillance program to lift shipment restriction zone (SRZ) and movement restriction zone (MRZ) were negative.

[5 & 6. Lift of shipment restriction zones (SRZ) and movement restriction zones (MRZ) at 3 of the farms which had undergone CSF infection, followed by complete implementation of the prescribed control measures (stamping out, disinfection etc). For the full details, please refer to the source URL].

7. Summary of the wild boar surveillance.
As of 4 Jun 2019, 1548 wild boars (307 dead and 1241 captured) in Gifu prefecture have been tested, and 693 (230 dead and 463 captured) were found to be positive for CSF virus (CSFV) by RT-PCR since 13 Sep 2018. 561 wild boars (28 dead and 533 captured) in Aichi prefecture have been tested, and 35 were found to be positive (12 dead and 23 captured) for CSFV by RT-PCR since 14 Sep 2018. 29 wild boars (6 dead and 23 captured) in Ehime prefecture have been tested, and 4 were found to be positive (0 dead and 4 captured) for CSFV by RT-PCR since 14 Sep 2018.

Among the other prefectures, 343 wild boars (296 dead and 47 captured) in 40 prefectures were tested, and all were found to be negative for CSFV by RT-PCR since 14 of Sep 2018.

Note: Vaccination policy in Japan is that vaccination for domestic animals only is prohibited. Since 24 Mar 2019, oral vaccine (bait vaccine) has been applied to wild boars in the selected area in Gifu and Aichi prefecture where CSF positive cases have been found in wild boars.

[OIE's summary of Japan's CSF event, as of 5 Jul 2019, is the following:

Total outbreaks = 688 (Submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Swine / 118 687 / 217 / 34 / 118 653 / 0
Wild boar / not available / 710 / 231 / 479 / 0

The outbreak reportedly started on 3 Sep 2019 when fattening pigs were found dead in Gifu and reported to the local authorities by a veterinarian. On 9 Sep 2019, sequencing analysis of the virus RNA was completed, and the National Institute of animal health (NIAH) confirmed CSF, excluding the feared possibility of African swine fever (ASF). Based upon genotyping, the source of infection was found likely to be China; the route of introduction has not been established. From the onset of the event, wild boars were found infected in the same region and were suspected to play a significant, though not exclusive, role in the further spread of the virus.

The CSF event in Japan may be viewed as a drill for an unfortunate future introduction of ASF virus, most likely by contaminated pork products, and indicative of the possible role of wild boar in its epidemiology. Swill feeding is not widely used in Japan, while its use is liable to heat treatment. Japan has applied severe measures in air and seaports to prevent the ASF virus, currently circulating throughout China and its neighbors, from being introduced by passengers.

Since March 2019, oral vaccination of wild boars, which have become the CSF virus reservoir in Japan, is being applied in affected areas. Unfortunately, no vaccine is yet available against ASF.
