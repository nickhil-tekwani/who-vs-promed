Monthly Notifiable Disease Surveillance Report - May 2022
---------------------------------------------------------
There were 12 cases of leptospirosis (9 confirmed and 3 under investigation) notified in [May 2022], compared with 7 cases for the same month in 2021. The 9 confirmed cases ranged in age from 25 to 70 years, 8 were male and 1 was female.

Seven confirmed cases reported exposure to animals (4 due to the nature of their occupation as farmers) and 4 had contact with rural streams, rivers, or lakes. Hospitalisation [status] was recorded for 7 of the confirmed cases, of which 6 (85.7%) were hospitalised. The serovar was identified for 4 confirmed cases; 2 were _Leptospira_ [serovar] Hardjo, 1 was _L_. [serovar] Ballum and 1 was _L_. [serovar] Copenhageni.

[Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that is distributed worldwide. Although more common in tropical areas of the world, leptospirosis is also found in temperate areas. Leptospirosis is transmitted to humans by direct contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes with the urine of infected animals or by contact with wet soil, vegetation, or fresh (not salty) water that has been contaminated with infected animal urine. These animals are mostly asymptomatic but chronically infected with one of more than 250 serovars of _Leptospira_ species, with multiple serovars being endemic in a given geographic area. Protective immunity against _Leptospira_ infection is predominantly serovar-specific.

Many species of wild and domestic animals (including rodents, dogs, cattle, swine, and perhaps river otters) are susceptible to chronic urinary infection with _Leptospira_. In carrier animals with chronic renal infections, leptospiruria persists for long periods or for life, and _Leptospira_ bacteria shed in urine may survive in fresh water or moist soil for weeks to months.

Leptospirosis is an occupational hazard for people who work outdoors or with animals; for example, workers in wet agricultural settings (such as rice field workers), ranchers, slaughterhouse workers, trappers, loggers, sewer workers, veterinarians, fishery workers, dairy farmers, or military personnel. Leptospirosis is also a risk from household exposure to infected pet animals or rodents.

Leptospirosis is a risk during recreational activities such as camping, freshwater swimming, canoeing, kayaking, rafting, golfing, and trail biking that involve exposure to water in lakes, rivers, or ponds contaminated by urine from _Leptospira_-infected animals. Inadequate disposal of trash and debris provides a suitable habitat for rat infestation in urban settings. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers.

The diagnosis of leptospirosis requires confirmation by MAT (microscopic agglutination test) serology, but an IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), IgM dipstick, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have been used to confirm the diagnosis (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3939550/). Dr. Jan Clement has cautioned (see ProMED post Leptospirosis - Australia (03): (QL) comment 20210525.8380596) that Seoul hantavirus infection, also transmitted by rats, may be misdiagnosed as leptospirosis because its clinical manifestations mimic those of leptospirosis.

Treatment with antibiotics (penicillin and doxycycline) can be effective, especially if started early in the disease. Doxycycline (200 mg orally, once weekly) has been shown to be effective for short-term prophylaxis in high-risk environments (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM198402233100805) for those exposed to contaminated floodwater or soil (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2018/infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/leptospirosis). Each 200-mg dose provides a benefit for up to 7 days, so the dose may be repeated if high-risk conditions persist longer than this. However, a Cochrane review of clinical research, testing whether taking doxycycline can prevent leptospirosis, found that data from trials, which "targeted different kinds of people -- travelers and people who live in at risk areas, encompassing soldiers, farmers, and students -- did not support the practice in all cases, though short-term travelers with a potential for high-risk exposure may be helped." (https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007342.pub2).

Although vaccines are available for immunizing non-human animals against some serovars of _Leptospira_ and are available in some countries for humans, no vaccine against leptospirosis is available for use in humans in the United States. - Mod.ML
