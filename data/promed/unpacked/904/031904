Bird flu hits central Viet Nam
---------------------------------
Almost 250 ducks in central Viet Nam have been killed by the bird flu
virus since 1 May 2007, the country's 1st outbreak of the disease in
more than a month, local health authorities reported.
Animal health staff in Nghe An Province have culled the remaining 360
ducks from the infected flock. The group had not been vaccinated
against bird flu.
Dien Tho commune, where the flock was raised, has now been
quarantined and disinfected.
The tests showed the ducks were infected with H5 virus, and further
tests will be carried out to determine whether it is H5N1, the deadly
strain that has killed 42 Vietnamese, the world's 2nd highest death
toll after Indonesia's 74.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said last month [April 2007] that
Viet Nam and 5 other developing countries would receive up to USD 2.5
million from donations made by the US and Japan.
The United Nations health agency also urged Viet Nam to accelerate
poultry vaccinations and target more ducks in its anti-bird flu
campaign. Thanks to the campaign, Viet Nam has had no human cases
since November 2005.

8500 chickens culled in 3 Savar farms
-------------------------------------------
Some 8500 chickens were culled in 3 poultry farms here [Unb, Savar]
Friday [4 May 2007] evening following detection of bird flu in a nearby farm.
Joint forces and livestock officials culled 4000 chickens in Masum
Poultry Farm of Abdul Karim, 2500 chickens in Lamia Poultry Farm of
Anwar Hossain and 2000 chickens in Patuakhali Poultry Farm-2 of Joynal Abedin.
On Thursday [3 May 2007], 1500 chickens were culled in Patuakhali
Poultry Farm in Rajason area following detection of bird flu.
After that, the government took a decision to cull the chickens of
the farms within a one-km area of the affected farm, and reported the
decision to the farm owners through a notification.
It also imposed a ban on transportation of poultry products in the
affected area.
On Thursday [3 May 2007] night, 2000 chickens of Khulna Poultry Farm
of Maulana Alamgir Hossain at Rajason were also culled.
The farm owners, however, claimed the disease to be "Ranikhet" [see comment].

["Ranikhet" is one of several synonyms used for Newcastle disease
(ND). The name, one of several names of ND, is derived from the
history of the disease, which was initially reported in 1926 from
Java and soon thereafter from Ranikhet in India, Colombo in Sri Lanka
and Newcastle in Britain (arriving there by ship from the Far East,
which docked at Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, unloading rubbish containing
chicken carcasses, which were fed to local chickens). ND ("Ranikhet")
is endemic in Bangladesh, contrary to Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI).
ND virus (NDV) belongs to the family _Paramyxoviridae_ (genus
_Avulavirus_), while HPAI belongs to the family _Orthomyxoviridae_
(genus _Influenzavirus A_). The clinical signs of NCD are rather
similar to those of HPAI (previously called also "Fowl Plague"); this
is reflected in other synonyms of NCD, such as Pseudo-Fowl Pest,
Pseudo-Poultry Plague, Avian pest and Korean Fowl Plague.
Avian influenza seems to continue its spread in Bangladesh, where it
reportedly started on 5 Feb 2007, was confirmed on 22 Mar 2007, and
was notified to the OIE on 30 Mar 2007. A follow-up report was
submitted on 30 Apr 2007. - Mod.AS]
