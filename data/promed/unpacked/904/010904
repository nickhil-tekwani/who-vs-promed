Horse owners and veterinarians in Alberta are on alert after an outbreak of Potomac horse fever, which causes death in up to 30 percent of cases.

The disease causes diarrhea, depression and intestinal problems and can occur after horses ingest snails, slugs, and insects in their food.

Sue McIntosh thought her horse, Finnegan, looked a bit off, so she rushed him to a veterinary clinic a couple of weeks ago. The 13-year-old horse was diagnosed with Potomac horse fever, a disease capable of killing horses in up to 30 per cent of cases. An outbreak of the illness has been declared in Alberta.

"He was in critical care for 3 days, and then he was there for another couple of days on IV with his ice boots on," says McIntosh, who runs a horse therapy program at Cremona, northwest of Calgary. "It's not just our family that's affected, because people are very connected to these animals, and they were worried." Finnegan recovered and was sent home, where he nuzzled with McIntosh during a recent interview.

The Moore Equine Veterinary Centre, just north of Calgary, treated Finnegan and several other horses with the illness. "The ones we see are typically the very sick horses," Dr. Gillian Haanen said, while checking on a patient. Fluid dripped into the horse from 2 large clear bags connected to the ceiling of a stall.

"Treatment is trying to kill the bacteria with an antibiotic, lots of fluids," Haanen says, adding boots filled with ice are also put on the horse's hooves to help with inflammation.

"In the more serious cases, they kind of go into this downward spiral where they're not feeling well. So those horses generally need aggressive treatment."

Potomac horse fever produces mild colic, fever and diarrhea in horses of all ages, as well as abortions in pregnant mares. The bacteria live inside snails, slugs and aquatic insects, such as mayflies and caddisflies. Horses eat the bugs while drinking water or eating hay or grass. Infected animals can lose up to 100 litres of fluid per day.

The disease was 1st identified in 1979 in the eastern United States near the Potomac River, but it has since been identified in various other locations in the United States, as well as in Alberta and Ontario.

"You might have clusters of cases, and that's what we're really seeing in Alberta this year [2020]," says Dr. Ashley Whitehead, a senior equine specialist at the University of Calgary. "At the clinic I worked at, we've probably had about 16 cases come in the last 2 months. It may not seem like too much, but it's a significant amount, because we're seeing the worst of the worse cases."

Whitehead says the university is participating in a study at the University of Guelph, which is looking into a 2nd bacterium also capable of causing the illness.

Some horses appear to be more susceptible to getting the fever, says Whitehead. It could be something disrupting the loads of bacteria in a horse's gastrointestinal tract. "Anything changing the harmony ends up causing the potential for something else to get in and overtake it," says Whitehead. "Anything stressing the horse can change the bacterial population in there."

Jennifer Maciej has her own theory. Maciej lost a horse, Sultan, to Potomac horse fever 5 years ago. "It was absolutely horrific. He went from the diarrhea, depressed, not wanting to eat and all of that," she said from her home east of Edmonton. "You could see the emotion. You could tell he was still there. But the 3rd time I went and saw him, he was done. It was like, 'I'm so sorry. I'm done fighting."'

Maciej says horses are attuned to the emotions of their owners. And during the COVID-19 pandemic, many people have been upset in their personal lives. "We've got a lot of people stressed, especially this year [2020] with COVID. And when people are stressed, it transfers over to the animals. And they can only take so much," she says. "It's like with people; we're more susceptible to getting sick when we're stressed. I believe animals are exactly the same."

Although horses can get a form of coronavirus, there's been no record of equine cases of COVID-19.

["Potomac horse fever (PHF) is an acute enterocolitis syndrome producing mild colic, fever, and diarrhea in horses of all ages, as well as abortion in pregnant mares. The causative agent is _Neorickettsia risticii_. The infection of enterocytes of the small and large intestine results in acute colitis, which is one of the principal clinical signs of PHF. The disease is usually seen in spring, summer, and early fall and is associated with pastures bordering creeks or rivers. The epidemiology of PHF has been shown to involve a trematode vector. Sporadic disease caused by _N risticii_ has been reported in dogs and cats; cattle appear to be resistant to infection."

"_N risticii_ is a gram-negative obligate intracellular bacterium with a trophism for monocytes. Initial morphologic studies of this organism isolated from cell culture, as well as the serologic responses of _N risticii_, caused this bacterium to be assigned to the genus _Ehrlichia_. However, DNA analyses have shown _N risticii_ is most closely related to _N helminthoeca_, the agent of salmon poisoning in dogs, and _Ehrlichia sennetsu_, a disease of people in Japan. The organism is not visible in monocytes in blood films from clinical cases, in contrast to _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_, which is readily identifiable in granulocytes of infected horses.

"_N risticii_ has been identified in freshwater snails and isolated from trematodes released from the snails. _N risticii_ DNA was detected in 13 species of immature and adult caddisflies (Trichoptera), mayflies (Ephemeroptera), damselflies (Odonata, Zygoptera), dragonflies (Odonata, Anisoptera), and stoneflies (Plecoptera). Transmission studies using _N risticii_-infected caddisflies have reproduced the clinical disease. One route of exposure is believed to be inadvertent ingestion of hatched aquatic insects that carry _N risticii_ in the metacercarial stage of a trematode. The incubation period is around 10-18 days. The causative organism is present in the feces of experimentally infected horses, but the biologic significance of this is unknown. Clinically ill horses are not contagious and can be housed with susceptible horses. Additional studies are needed to determine the exact role of the vector and helminth hosts in the complex maintenance cycle of _N risticii_."

Potomac horse fever presents with clinical signs of mild depression, anorexia and fever, decreased intestinal sounds. These are followed by diarrhea which may be mild to moderate, or very watery. Horses at this point may have colic or abdominal discomfort. Some horses have dehydration and sepsis. These clinical signs are frequently indistinguishable from the clinical signs of _Salmonella_. Other clinical signs may include laminitis. Abortion may occur in pregnant mares.

Treatment with the antibiotic oxytetracycline should result in signs of improvement and a reduction of fever in approximately 12 hours. Antimicrobial therapy, fluids and non-steroidals should continue for a minimum of 5 days but may be longer.

There is a vaccine for the prevention of this disease. "Several inactivated, whole-cell vaccines based on the same strain of _N risticii_ are commercially available. Although vaccination has been reported to protect 78 percent of experimentally infected ponies, it has been marginally protective in the field. Vaccine failure has been attributed to antigenic and genomic heterogeneity among the over 14 different strains of _N risticii_ isolated from naturally occurring cases. Furthermore, vaccine failure may also be due to lack of antibody protection at the site of exposure, because the natural route of transmission has been determined to be oral ingestion of the agent. Minimizing insect ingestion in stabled horses by turning off barn lights at night, which normally attract the insects, has been suggested."

This disease is definitely hard on the animal and any caring owner, but it is not necessarily a death sentence to the animal as some other diseases are. As with any illness, early detection of your animal being off his/her best and early treatment are important.

There are several other names by which Potomac horse fever has been called. Those names include equine monocytic ehrlichiosis, ditch fever, Shasta River crud, and equine ehrlichial colitis. You will note that some of these synonyms are descriptive of the water as well as the condition.

Despite the name, this disease is fairly widespread, and if the disease is in your area, consult your veterinarian regarding vaccination of your animal. - Mod.TG
