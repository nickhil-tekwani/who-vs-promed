The TV show I saw last night showed American Crows and House Finches dying in New York City.
These and most other species that nest in the NYC area -- and thus would have the longest exposure
to transmission of the virus -- do not migrate very far, and go toward the southeastern USA, not as
far as Puerto Rico.
Migrant birds that have West Nile-like virus may not be able to fly very far and might well die
before reaching PR.
Very few migrant birds (perhaps 1% of the population of any one species) would pass through the
NYC area and of those, most would be exposed for a very short period of time in NYC -- just a
few days to refuel. Fall migration is much more leisurely for most species of birds (in contrast
to the spring when they are racing to get to prime breeding territories ). For example, Barn
Swallows (_Hirundo rustica_) nest in the NYC area, but individuals are thought to mix with flocks
of other swallow species and spend a few days here and there feeding at several spots before
showing up in the tropics. Barn Swallows from North America will hang around PR for a few weeks
before heading to Brazil. Having said that, nobody knows for sure how long individual small
landbirds will linger before heading to S America.
Banding data is not very helpful on this point. I reviewed USF&WS [US Fish & Wildlife Service
birdbanding data for all birds banded in North America and later recovered in PR since the 1930's.
There were no recoveries for any of the small landbirds. For example for one common migrant
warbler (Parulidae) that winters in PR, over 15 000 have been banded this century, but only 15 have
been recovered anywhere on their wintering ground, and none in PR. So we don't know much about
where individual breeding landbird populations winter, let alone how long individuals linger in NYC
or anywhere else.
But the bottom line is that to the extent to which the outbreak is limited to the NYC area, the
chances of this virus reaching PR any time soon are vanishingly small.
Just to illustrate my points above: I saw [27 species of sea, water & land birds on 30 Aug 1999 in a
walk around Central Park [New York City. None migrate to Puerto Rico or South America except
as rarities, except for:
Northern Parula _Parula americana_
Black-and-white Warbler _Mniotilta varia_
American Redstart _Setophaga ruticilla_
These 3 species are common migrants that winter in woodlands in PR, but not in South America.
However, they require woodland habitat and I don't know that any breed in NYC. They do breed in
woodlands at the fringes of metro NYC.
Canada Warbler _Wilsonia canadensis_
This warbler breeds in mountains in upstate NY and was just a migrant in Central Park. Winters in
northern South America.
