Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - Kuwait 23 Sep 2015
----------------------------------------------------------------------
On [19 Sep 2015], the National IHR Focal Point of Kuwait notified WHO of one additional fatal case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection.

Details of the case
A 78-year-old male from Kuwait city developed symptoms on [8 Sep 2015] and, on [13 Sep 2015], was admitted to hospital. The patient, who had comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on [14 Sep 2015]. The patient owned dromedary camels and had a history of frequent contact with them. He had no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. The patient passed away on [19 Sep 2015]. Contact tracing of household and healthcare contacts is ongoing for this case.

Globally, WHO has been notified of 1570 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 555 related deaths.

[This is the 4th case of MERS-CoV infection reported by Kuwait since the beginning of MERS-CoV identification in 2012. Previously, there were 2 cases reported in November 2013 and 1 case in March 2014 (see MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (17): Kuwait, UAE, Saudi Arabia, WHO, RFI 20140320.2345849; MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (88): Kuwait, WHO, Spain 20131119.2062587; and MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (86): Kuwait, 1st rep, susp, RFI 20131113.2052320 for details). In total there have been 2 fatalities reported, including this current case.

Possible high risk exposures of the earlier cases (those reported in 2013 and 2014) were not available in the prior reports. From the report above it appears as though this current case will be classified as a zoonotic transmission.

It would be interesting to know if serosurveys for MERS-CoV antibody prevalence in populations are being conducting in other countries in the Middle East where cases have been reported, such as Kuwait, Qatar, and Oman and where the dromedary camel is present, farmed, and raced. It seems curious that there have been significantly fewer cases reported from these countries (Kuwait 4, Qatar 13, Oman 8 -- from the ECDC Communicable Disease threats report of 19 Sep 2015, available at http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/communicable-disease-threats-report-19-sep-2015.pdf).

[3] Camels and the Hajj, ban - media report 19 Sep 2015

For the 1st time, the Ministry of Hajj has banned all campaigns from organizing visits to camel barns and stockades.

Pilgrims, especially those coming to the Kingdom for the 1st time, arrange visits and activities at archaeological and historical tourist sites in Makkah and Madinah.

The government directive comes after the authorities designated camels as the "main source" of Middle East Respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) following "scientific evidence."

The Ministry of Health confirmed camels are not permitted to enter or be present at any Haj site or surrounding area for any reason and are banned from being used for sacrifice.

Since 2012, 1240 coronavirus cases have been reported. Of them, 664 have been cured, 52 are undergoing treatment and/or are isolated in their homes. 524 people have died [see section [1] above for statistics as of 23 Sep 2015].

[As a reminder, earlier last week (week of 14 Sep 2015), the Ministry of the Hajj banned slaughtering of camels in the Hajj sites. The ban above against visiting camel barns is not surprising as there have been cases of MERS-CoV in individuals who had a history of visiting camel barns/farms and drinking raw camel milk in the 14 days prior to onset of their illness. From the media report in section [4] below, one wonders if these bans can be 100 percent effective. - Mod.MPP]

[4] Camels and the Hajj, in spite of the ban - media report 23 Sep 2015

Despite frequent Ministry of Health's warnings against contact with camels and a ban on slaughtering of camels, pilgrims, and Hajj establishment staff eat 100 camels a day, Makkah daily reported.

It seems that the lovers of camel meat are not scared of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) although several studies have linked the disease to camels. Moreover, restaurants serving camel meat continue to be crowded with camel meat lovers who refuse to believe there is a link between the virus and the meat of their beloved animal.

[One camel salesperson] says one should not worry or feel scared about eating camel meat because restaurants in Makkah slaughter camels outside Makkah as per the instructions and directives of Makkah Emir's Office.

A veterinary doctor, who requested anonymity, said camel meat is not banned and the measures taken currently are precautionary in their nature and are related to slaughter of camels in Makkah. Therefore, one can have a camel slaughtered outside Makkah and bring its meat here, especially small camels which showed no link with coronavirus.

Dr Muhammad Fawtawi, director of environment health at Makkah Municipality, confirmed that the measures are precautionary, noting that camel meat is tested before and after slaughter.

"There are no health risks from eating camel meat at restaurants serving small camel meat. The real danger lies in getting in direct contact with people or animals suspected of having coronavirus. Generally, the situation is under control and there is no need to worry," he said.
