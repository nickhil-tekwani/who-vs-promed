TICKS IN MADAGASCAR? (02)
=========================
[see: Ticks in Madagascar? 970517222528.
A quick perusal of the 4 posting below indicates that ticks do exist in
Madagascar, which was the query in the original posting. - mod. p.c.]

Here are some references from my database re ticks & lemur in Madagascar.
Contact the Institute pasteur in Anntanarivo, they will also have information.

1985 Madagascar
*:Antibodies have frequently been detected to flaviviruses in lemurs.
Experimental infections with YF & WNV were performed. Infections resulting
were inapparent with a 3-4 day long viremia for YF & 4-6 with WN. Authors
conclude that lemurs could act as amlifying hosts for WN virus if it were
introduced & hosts for YF if introduced. Brief dicussion of Aedes
potential vectors. (8 refs)

*:5 strains of CCHF were isolated from ticks taken from beef carcasses at a
slaughter house. This appears to be the first isolation of the virus from
the country.

*:381 adults tested by IIF for antibodies against Ebola, Lassa, CCHF and
RVF. Highest prev. to Ebola=3D4.5% [I have left this unedited but am sure
this is a computer translation error of some kind. Mod. pc]. Possibly a
less pathogenic strain forund
on the island as no sevre symptoms seen. In absence of Mastomys and
Praomys on island, no surprise that there was no Lassa. CCF and RVF
relatively low. Also no reactions to Marburg.

Ornithodoros moubata Borrelia duttoni
tick borne diseases ticks
relapsing fever
*:Authors believe that relapsing fever caused by B. duttoni has disappeared
from the country as no cases have been reported for 30 years. The vector
has also become very rare and people did not recognize the tick. Authors
believe that the reduction in the growing of pigs and the house-spraying by
the mosquito vector control programmes are the reason for the disappearence
of the Borellia. (13 refs)

There certainly are ticks on Madagascar - a staightforward Medline search
picks out over 20 references over the last 30 years or so. The argasid
_Ornithodorus moubata_ is present and a number of hard tick genera,
Boophilus, Haemaphysalis, Amblyomma and Ixodes.
Particularly useful references would appear to be:
Fontenille et al 1985, Archives Institute Pasteur Madagascar 52 171- 80 and
1984 51. 161-202. Hoogstraal 1973 J Parasitol. 59 1099-1117.

There are ticks on the island of Madagascar and other islands in the
Malagasy region.
See: Harry Hoogstraal, 1953, Ticks (Ixodoidea) of the Malagasy Faunal
Region (excepting the Seychelles), Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative
Zoology at Harvard College, Vol III, No. 2: 37-113. This work discusses
both native and introduced species.

From: "Dr. Norman Ronald" <n-ronald@TVMDL.TAMU.EDU>
There are no listings for tick borne diseases of man for Madagascar. Q
fever has been reported there but I suspect the transmission was by routes
other than tick borne. I suspect there may be host specific ticks such as
_Boophilus microplus_ which have been introduced to the island.
