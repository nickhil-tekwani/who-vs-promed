Enzootic patterns of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in imported African and local Arabian dromedary camels: a prospective genomic study.

Summary

1. Background
The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a lethal zoonotic pathogen endemic to the Arabian Peninsula. Dromedary camels are a likely source of infection and the virus probably originated in Africa. We studied the genetic diversity, geographical structure, infection prevalence, and age-associated prevalence among camels at the largest entry port of camels from Africa into the Arabian Peninsula.

2. Methods
In this prospective genomic study, we took nasal samples from camels imported from Sudan and Djibouti into the Port of Jeddah in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia over an almost 2-year period and local Arabian camels over 2 months in the year after surveillance of the port. We determined the prevalence of MERS-CoV infection, age-associated patterns of infection, and undertook phylogeographical and migration analyses to determine intercountry virus transmission after local lineage establishment. We compared all virological characteristics between the local and imported cohorts. We compared major gene deletions between African and Arabian strains of the virus. Reproductive numbers were inferred with Bayesian birth death skyline analyses.

3. Findings
Between 10 Aug 2016, and 3 May 2018, we collected samples from 1196 imported camels, of which 868 originated from Sudan and 328 from Djibouti, and between 1 May, and 25 Jun 2018, we collected samples from 472 local camels, of which 189 were from Riyadh and 283 were from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Virus prevalence was higher in local camels than in imported camels (224 [47·5%] of 472 vs 157 [13·1%] of 1196; p less than 0·0001). Infection prevalence peaked among camels older than 1 year and aged up to 2 years in both groups, with 255 (66·9%) of 381 positive cases in this age group. Although the overall geographical distribution of the virus corresponded with the phylogenetic tree topology, some virus exchange was observed between countries corresponding with trade routes in the region. East and west African strains of the virus appear to be geographically separated, with an origin of west African strains in east Africa. African strains of the virus were not re-sampled in Saudi Arabia despite sampling approximately 1 year after importation from Africa. All local Arabian samples contained strains of the virus that belong to a novel recombinant clade (NRC) 1st detected in 2014 in Saudi Arabia. Reproduction number estimates informed by the sequences suggest sustained endemicity of NRC, with a mean Re of 1·16.

4. Interpretation
Despite frequent imports of MERS-CoV with camels from Africa, African lineages of MERS-CoV do not establish themselves in Saudi Arabia. Arabian strains of the virus should be tested for changes in virulence and transmissibility.

[From the discussion chapter of the paper, the following 2 sections have been extracted:

"The present study provides further insight into the diversity of MERS-CoV. By analysing a large number of strains of MERS-CoV imported into Saudi Arabia from major African trade ports, we showed that Arabian strains of the virus are isolated from African strains and identify African MERS-CoV clades that were not as clearly distinguished in previous studies. Although all African strains of the virus share common ancestors in east Africa, only clade C1 presently appears in west and north Africa. Even if all African clades are represented in east Africa, no single place sampled so far in east Africa represents the whole diversity of MERS-CoV variants. Phylogeographical and social network analyses suggest that the present distribution of African clades is not predominantly shaped by transregional exchange but mainly reflects the phylogenetic tree structure. Camel trade, such as via the Sahel route connecting east and west Africa, corresponds with the present location of C1.1 strains but does not seem to cause a bidirectional exchange of strains between east and west Africa. Only for the clustering of Moroccan with west African strains and some strains from Kenya and Djibouti, the geographical distance between sites exceeds that of the attributed genetic distance, suggesting recent exchange through trade routes. Our phylogenetic tree structure shows that only parts of the diversity of clades C1 and C3 are represented in Sudan. Recombination between these clades is not observed, despite co-occurrence in Sudan. Therefore, Sudan appears to be a frequent recipient of viral lineages from other regions although we did not identify any strictly Sudan-specific lineages."

"Our study had several limitations including restricted geographical coverage in terms of camels studied in Africa and Saudi Arabia, an absence of age-related data in 15% of camels, and an absence of data on local MERS-CoV circulating strains in Sudan. Thus, some of our interpretations might need to be updated based on intensified sampling efforts in the future.

All MERS-CoV strains we isolated in Saudi Arabia belong to clade NRC circulating since 2014. Previously, clades in camels have subsequently been replaced by other clades, corresponding to a pattern of enzootic acute infections with short waves of prevailing individual subtypes. Although our data are not representative for all of Saudi Arabia, the evidence we collected by sampling from 2 sites as remote from each other as Jeddah and Riyadh indicates prolonged circulation of the recombinant MERS-CoV clade as a dominant strain. The increased detection rate of MERS-CoV RNA in camels from the Arabian Peninsula reported in this and previous studies points towards differences in transmission dynamics and selection pressure. Further studies across a wider geographical area should be undertaken to understand potential changes in virulence and transmissibility associated with this strain. These studies should include direct comparisons between African and Arabian strains."

Since June 2012, when the MERS-CoV event started, and as of the end of November 2019, a total of 2494 laboratory-confirmed human cases of the syndrome have been reported globally by the WHO, including 858 associated deaths (case-fatality rate: 34.4%). Cases were reported from 27 countries, but, by far, most of them (2012 cases) were from Saudi Arabia (including 780 related deaths, with a case-fatality rate of 37.1%).

Dromedary camels have been confirmed by several studies to be the reservoir of the MERS-CoV infection in humans. Zoonotic transmissions of MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans were reported on multiple occasions. MERS-CoV has never been reported as a disease in camels, though in experimental infections, MERS-CoV has been associated with mild upper respiratory signs.

The MERS virus has been identified in dromedary camels in several countries, including Burkina Faso, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Jordan, Kenya, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Mali, Morocco, Nigeria, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Spain (Canary Islands), Somalia, Sudan, Tunisia, and the United Arab Emirates. There is further evidence suggesting the MERS-CoV is widespread in dromedary camels in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia.

The gap between human incidence rates in the Arabian Peninsula compared to other countries is striking. Over 70% of infected dromedaries are found in Africa, but all known zoonotic cases of MERS have occurred in the Arabian Peninsula, with none being reported in Africa. The results of the presented research may contribute to the unravelling of the enigma; for this end, and as indicated by the authors, the Arabian MERS-CoV strains should be tested for changes in virulence and transmissibility. - Mod.AS]
