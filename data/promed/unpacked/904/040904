[1] FDA: Pfizer-BioNTech booster

People over age 65 and adults at high risk of severe COVID-19 can receive a booster dose of the Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE vaccine, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said, opening a new and more controversial phase of the US immunization campaign.

The emergency-use authorization also allows boosters for people 18 and older whose occupational exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus puts them at elevated risk of serious complications. Booster doses can be given any time at least 6 months after a person received their 2nd shot, the FDA said in a statement.

Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock said the authorization would allow people such as teachers and daycare staff, as well as healthcare and grocery workers, to get the 3rd shot. The authorization applies only to the Pfizer-BioNTech shot, the agency said.

The emergency clearance is in line with a recommendation last week from FDA advisers but narrower than the full approval that Pfizer and its German partner had sought. It means that the Biden administration will have to move more slowly on its planned wider rollout of boosters proposed last month [August 2021].

Third doses were previously authorized for certain people with compromised immune systems. "We believe boosters have an important role to play in addressing the continued threat of this disease, alongside efforts to increase global access and uptake among the unvaccinated," Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla said in a statement. "Today's FDA action is an important step in helping the most vulnerable among us remain protected from COVID-19."

While less broad than some had hoped, the authorization leaves the door open for the FDA to consider broader use of boosters, including in younger adults, as more data on their safety and efficacy become available. And it assures that many of the older Americans who were first in line for the initial shots will be among the earliest to get additional protection.

A surge in virus infections caused by the delta variant has coincided with fears that vaccine potency will fade as the weather turns colder. Scientists have been divided on the need for boosters. Real-world studies suggested that the efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine diminished somewhat this summer, especially in preventing mild breakthrough cases, though it is hard to distinguish waning immunity from the effects of the highly infectious delta variant.

But other data have suggested that the shot provides lasting protection against severe disease leading to hospitalization and death, and some researchers have said that boosters for most people could be put off for some time. Pfizer shares rose 0.8% in after-hours trading on Wednesday [22 Sep 2021], while shares of BioNTech gained 0.5%.

The FDA said it authorized the booster in part because of an analysis from Pfizer showing that people who got the vaccine earlier in a clinical trial showed "a modest decrease in the efficacy" in July and August [2021] compared with those who had received the vaccines later.

In addition, the agency considered real-world effectiveness data on the vaccine's efficacy from the UK, USA and Israel. Safety of the booster doses was studied in over 300 people, most of them ages 18-55. The most common side effects were pain and swelling at the injection site, fatigue, headache and muscle pain. Swollen lymph nodes in the armpit were more common after the booster dose than the first 2 doses, the agency said.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is expected to meet Thursday [23 Sep 2021] to make its own recommendations about who should receive the additional dose. The panel, made up of outside vaccine experts, met Wednesday [22 Sep 2021] for a general review of vaccine efficacy over time and booster-shot science.

Some members raised the question of whether people who had received a Moderna Inc. or Johnson & Johnson vaccine for their primary immunization should receive the Pfizer booster, or whether they should wait to match with a supplemental dose of the shot they first received. FDA vaccine official Doran Fink told the panel on Wednesday that the agency is "working as rapidly as possible" to review Moderna's booster submission. Since the FDA said 13 Aug 2021 that people with weakened immune systems can receive a 3rd shot, more than 2 million Americans have gotten one, according to CDC data.

The clearance for now leaves booster shots off the table for younger recipients of the Pfizer shot, which was approved for ages 16 and up earlier this year [2021] and can be given to adolescents from 12-15 under an emergency authorization. There has been concern among some scientists, including members of the FDA's vaccine advisory panel, about the risk of heart-related side effects from the vaccine, particularly in younger males.

Use of a 3rd shot to protect vulnerable people was backed by recent evidence from other countries. An Israeli study in the New England Journal of Medicine showed a 3rd dose of the Pfizer vaccine can dramatically cut rates of COVID-related illness in people 60 and older. Additionally, a Pfizer study suggested that the efficacy of its first 2 shots waned in a matter of months, and that booster doses are an effective way to combat the spread of the virus and new variants.

Some critics have said that booster shots should wait until immunizations are more widespread globally. World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has argued that uneven vaccine distribution will be the world's biggest obstacle to ending the pandemic and recovering. Prior to last week's meeting of the vaccine advisory panel, top scientists and 2 FDA officials, in a review published in The Lancet, questioned the scientific support for a 3rd shot, saying available doses would be better used to immunize the unvaccinated.

["Moderna said at the beginning of September [2021] that it has submitted initial data on its booster to the FDA. The company is developing a 3rd dose that contains half the amount of mRNA, the genetic code that provokes an immune response, as the original shots. Clinical testing showed this booster, when given 6 months after the completion of initial immunization, prompted a strong antibody response to the coronavirus, including the delta variant.

"Johnson & Johnson, whose vaccine is given as one shot, said in August [2021] that it has evidence that a booster shot prompts a strong immune response in people 6 months after their initial shot.

"On Tuesday [21 Sep 2021], Johnson & Johnson released more information on use of a booster dose: Giving people a 2nd shot 2 months after the 1st one boosted protection against moderate to severe disease from about 75% to as much as 100%.

"In addition, the company said waiting to give that 2nd shot until 6 months after the 1st shot boosts antibody levels even more than giving it after 2 months -- by 12-fold versus 4-fold to 6-fold. The results suggest that waiting longer for that 2nd shot provides stronger protection.

"Johnson & Johnson said it has given the information to the FDA and plans to submit it to other regulators as well" (https://n.pr/3lVULRX). - Mod.LK]

[2] Israel: booster warning
Date: Tue 21 Sep 2021 17:00 EDT

https://www.science.org/content/article/israel-s-struggles-contain-covid-19-may-be-warning-other-nations


Israel, among the 1st countries to launch coronavirus vaccinations and the 1st to roll out booster shots on a large scale, is offering a disturbing glimpse of what could be in store for other rich nations if they begin to give boosters this fall [2021]. Israel launched its pioneering booster campaign in late July, prompted by a surge in cases reflecting the extreme contagiousness of the delta variant, the loosening of restrictions, and an apparent waning of protection from vaccines given in early winter. But cases have risen even higher since, suggesting boosters are far from a panacea when children and others remain unvaccinated.

Since 30 Jul 2021, Israel has given a 3rd shot of messenger RNA vaccine to more than 3 million people, including a majority of those 40 and older. Yet Israel is "stuck in a status quo of 1000 or 900 new cases per million per day," says Ran Balicer, chief innovation officer at Clalit Health Services, Israel's largest health maintenance organization, "which is a very bad status quo to be stuck at."

Public health experts differ about exactly why a country of 9.3 million that is vaccinating so aggressively still has one of the highest rates of reported infections per capita in the world, more than twice that of the United States. Extensive testing and social factors may play a role. But David Dowdy, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, says it's a sign that "providing booster shots alone does not dramatically change the course or trajectory of transmission at a country level. Because the majority of transmission is still occurring from people who are unvaccinated." Israel's vaccination rate -- 64% of its population has received at least 2 doses -- puts it ahead of the United States but behind some 30 other countries.

Israel's experience is feeding into booster discussions such as last Friday's [17 Sep 2021] meeting of advisers to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which voted unanimously to recommend a booster dose of Pfizer and BioNTech's SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, but only for people 65 and older and those at high risk of severe disease.

Among Israelis 60 and older who received a booster, the risk of infection fell 11-fold in August [2021] and the risk of severe disease 20-fold compared with their twice-vaccinated peers, according to a study of 1.1 million Israelis published in The New England Journal of Medicine last week and discussed by the FDA committee. At the meeting, Ron Milo, a systems biologist at the Weizmann Institute of Science, presented data showing that during August, the virus' ability to spread -- its so-called reproduction number -- fell by 30%, until each infected person was infecting slightly less than one additional person, a threshold that's essential for ultimately ending an outbreak.

But Israel's recent case counts don't reflect that trend, noted advisory committee member Amanda Cohn, chief medical officer at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's respiratory disease center. "Why is it that if your [reproduction number] went below one...you're at your highest [new case] rates right now?" she asked at the meeting.

The paradox reflects social realities, Sharon Alroy-Preis, director of public health services for Israel's Ministry of Health, told the meeting. Public schools opened on 1 Sep 2021 and the Jewish High Holy Days, with their attendant travel and family gatherings, stretch from 6 to 27 Sep 2021. (Many Israelis do not wear masks at indoor family gatherings.)

Balicer, who is chair of the expert committee that advises the Israeli government on pandemic response, agrees. "The combination of [unvaccinated] children meeting in school followed up by large family gatherings is the recipe for mass dissemination of the disease," he told Science.

A significant portion of the new infections is occurring in the 2 million Israeli children who are younger than 12, for whom vaccines are not yet approved. Whereas this group represented 24% of new infections on 14 Aug 2021, that number had risen to 42% in the week ending 16 Sep 2021. "There are 2 parallel forces driving this proportion up: school opening, and gradually increased protection of the older population," Balicer says. More than three-quarters of Israelis who are 60 and older have received boosters.

Israel's case count likely reflects a 3rd factor, too -- extensive testing, says Dvir Aran, a biomedical data scientist at the Israel Institute of Technology (Technion). "Since school started, children must get tested if there was a confirmed case in their class. This means that many more children are getting tested." (His 2-year-old daughter is now in quarantine with her mother, separated from him and her siblings, because a preschool classmate tested positive.)

Even as infections surge in children, daily new severe cases have declined from between 90 and 100 in late August to about 70 so far in September [2021]. Because children are less likely to get severely ill from COVID-19, "We are seeing a lot of new cases, but we don't see a lot of new severe patients," says Dror Mevorach, a physician who cares for COVID-19 patients at Hadassah Hospital Ein Kerem and advises the government.

The booster campaign has also dramatically shifted the vaccination status of people who do get seriously ill. In mid-August, after vaccine efficacy had started to wane and before the effects of boosters had taken hold, 59% of severe patients were fully vaccinated. By mid-September, 70% of new cases of severe illness were in the unvaccinated. "All [our] severe and critical patients below 60 are nonvaccinated," Mevorach says of his hospital.

Dowdy cautions that Israel may be an outlier rather than a harbinger for Western nations. Schools have reopened in dozens of other countries that are not experiencing equivalent surges -- and many nations with very low levels of vaccination aren't facing outbreaks akin to Israel's. "What's happening in Israel isn't happening really anywhere else in the world," he says. Ruth Hershberg, an evolutionary microbiologist at Technion, thinks Israel's high rate of testing could be a factor. "We are better at detecting cases [than most other countries]," she says.

But Aran worries an Israel-like situation awaits nations that began vaccination campaigns later, even if they begin to offer boosters. "Beware," he says. "The combination of delta and waning immunity is bound to create very harsh outbreaks in other countries as well, not just in Israel."

Israeli experts hope a continuing booster drive will help the country emerge from the current holding pattern. "The majority of Israelis over 40 have [received] a booster. But it's a minority under 40. And infections all over the world are driven by the young," Hershberg says.

The country is also turning to other measures to contain its surge. Beginning on 3 Oct 2021, to gain access to sporting and cultural events, restaurants, hotels, gyms, bars, universities, and religious services of 50 or more, people 12 and older will need to show proof they were fully vaccinated no longer than 6 months ago -- or that they have received a booster.

[3] USA: R.1 variant in 47 states
Date: Wed 22 Sep 2021 12:48 EDT

https://www.newsweek.com/dangerously-mutated-covid-r1-variant-detected-47-us-states-1631614


A new COVID variant that infected vaccinated residents and staff at a Kentucky nursing home has been detected in 47 US states, according to data. The R.1 variant spread through 45 residents and staff at the nursing home after an unvaccinated staff member triggered the infections in March [2021], the Kentucky Department of Public Health revealed.

Due to its mutation, the variant, first detected in Japan, was able to bypass the antibody protection present in the fully vaccinated. According to Outbreak.info, a website that collects data on COVID variants, as of 21 Sep 2021, R.1 has now infected more than 10 567 people around the world and has been detected in 47 states.

Maryland was found to have the highest number of cases, with 399 cases being detected since it was first found in the country. In total, 2259 Americans have been found with the R.1 strain, which was first detected in the country on 15 Mar 2020. The latest case to be detected in the USA was on 6 Aug 2021 and was found in 0.5% of cases. Outbreak.info also reported the strain has been found in at least 31 countries worldwide, including China, India and many nations in western Europe.

Despite the low number of infections, former Harvard Medical School professor William A. Haseltine said the new mutations found in the R.1 variant could help it spread more easily. Writing in Forbes, Haseltine said the 5 variations found in R.1 can lead to "increased resistance to antibodies." This means it could make the variant better at evading those antibodies that are created by having the vaccine and in those who have already been infected.

R.1 contains the W152L mutation in a region of the spike protein that is the target of antibodies that could reduce their effectiveness, according to the CDC. The W152L mutation was also present in a minor variant of the delta strain that was detected in India.

R.1 also shares a mutation with other variants, namely, C241U, NSP12: P323L, and D614G. D614G causes increased infections while it is not known what effect the other 2 have. All 3 mutations have been detected in strains that superseded the original Wuhan strain.

Data from John Hopkins University found that, as of Tuesday [21 Sep 2021], the COVID-19 pandemic had killed more than 4.55 million people and had infected some 229 million.

The World Health Organization continues to monitor COVID-19 strains and classifies them based on their rate of infections. Eta, iota and kappa were recently downgraded from being "variants of concern" to "variants under monitoring" after their circulation was hindered by other variants.

["R.1 is a variant to watch. It has established a foothold in both Japan and the United States. In addition to several mutations notably in the spike and nucleocapsid protein in common with variants of concern, R.1 has a set of unique mutations that may confer an additional advantage in transmission, replication, and immune suppression" (https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamhaseltine/2021/09/20/a-new-usjapan-variant-to-watch). - Mod.LK]
