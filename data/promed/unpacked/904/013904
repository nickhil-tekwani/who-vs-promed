The 1st case of scrapie has been diagnosed in the Falkland Islands. It was
found at Cape Dolphin in a 7 year old, home-bred ewe which has always bred
naturally and has not been involved in any AI [artificial insemination] or
ET [embryo transfer] program.
However, this case has been confirmed as being of a type called atypical
scrapie, as it does not follow the normal pattern shown in sheep with
classical scrapie.
Although classical scrapie has been known for over 250 years, the 1st case
of atypical scrapie was diagnosed in Norway in 1998. Because of the
worldwide interest in this disease, sheep have been subjected to far
greater scrutiny than in the past, with the result that new conditions are
being diagnosed.
More details about this condition will be given in the December edition of
the Wool Press, but in the meantime I would refer you to an article written
on the subject in the Wool Press of November 2004. We need your help in
discovering how widespread this condition is in the Falkland Islands.
In the meantime there is no need to be overly concerned, as the diagnosis
of this single case is not likely to affect the export of wool or sheep
meat. There may be longer-term consequences for the export of live sheep
and their genetic material.

[Scrapie is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy. The atypical form,
according to some pathologists, may be a sporadic form. This is not yet
proven, but it is speculated. The exact risk to other animals as well as to
humans from this atypical form is not yet defined. Atypical cases of
scrapie have been reported, since 2003, also from Norway, France, the UK
and Switzerland. So far, the scrapie strains involved in these cases have
not been shown to be related to BSE (bovine spongiform encephalitis). - Mod.TG]
