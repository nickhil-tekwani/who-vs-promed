Virus starts cancer in koalas
-------------------------------
A virus that jumped to koalas, possibly within the past 200 years, is
responsible for the astonishingly high incidence of koala cancer,
Australian researchers have found.
In a peculiar scientific twist, the virus is similar to those that trigger
leukemia in cats and gibbon apes. The virus is not known in other marsupial
species. "The initiating factor is the viral infection itself," virologist
Paul Young said yesterday [17 Jul 2004]. "That leads to cancers like
leukemia and lymphoma, and, also, to immune suppression and subsequent
infections like chlamydia," said Dr. Young, leader of the University of
Queensland team that identified the virus.
According to Dr. Young and his colleagues -- doctoral student Rachael
Tarlinton and veterinary scientist Joanne Meers -- fewer than 1 percent of
humans die of leukemia or lymphoma. However, up to 70 percent of captive
koalas, and 3 to 5 percent of wild koalas, die of cancer.
The killer virus -- an endogenous gamma retrovirus called KoRV -- was
identified 4 years ago by another UQ group. Dr. Young and his colleagues
then looked for the virus in 150 koalas, half of which were wild animals
brought to clinics, including Moggill Koala Hospital near Brisbane. The
remaining koalas live in the colony at Dreamworld, on the Gold Coast, which
helped fund the research. Every koala tested positive for KoRV, which is
inherited. But, those with cancers, and immunosuppressive diseases, had
high viral levels. "What we're trying to do now is find [out] if certain
strains of the virus are more or less likely to cause disease, and, try to
select those animals for breeding or translocation programs," Ms. Tarlinton
said.
The findings were presented at DNA7, an international conference on ancient
DNA in Brisbane this week [week ending Sun 18 Jul 2004]. The team also
hopes to obtain DNA from historical koalas to pinpoint when koalas were 1st
infected. Because KoRV is so close to the gibbon virus, it is suspected
that it jumped to both apes and koalas from another species.

[Endogenous retroviruses are thought to have arisen as a result of
infection of germ-line cells and now are inherited as Mendelian genes. It
was established previously by Hanger et al. in Brisbane that the Koala
retrovirus (KoRV) is an endogenous retrovirus, morphologically similar to
mammalian C-type retroviruses. KoRV was detected initially by electron
microscopy in mitogen-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures
from numerous koalas and in lymphoma tissue from others. Viral mRNA, viral
genomic RNA, and reverse transcriptase activity were present in koala serum
and cell culture supernatants. Sequences analysis of these RNAs and
Southern blot analysis of koala tissue genomic DNA using labelled KoRV
probes demonstrated banding consistent with an endogenous retrovirus.
Complete (and truncated) proviruses were detected in DNA of both clinically
normal koalas and those with hematopoietic disease. KoRV-related viruses
were not detected in other marsupials, and phylogenetic analysis showed
that KoRV clustered with gibbon ape leukemia virus. The close similarity
between gibbon ape leukemia virus and KoRV indicated unexpectedly that
these viruses are closely related and that cross-species transmission may
have occurred in the recent past. Gibbon leukemia virus is a replication
competent member of the genus _Gammaretrovirus_, which includes both
exogenous viruses (like murine leukemia virus) and endogenous viruses like
KoRV. The new data presented in the above report do not shed any direct
light on the origin of KoRV. A striking finding of this new research is the
difference in disease incidence between wild koalas and those maintained in
captivity. It remains to be established whether this difference is
determined by genetic divergence or by environmental factors. - Mod.CP]
