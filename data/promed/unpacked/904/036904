The Public Health Agency of Canada is warning the public about an outbreak of a potentially deadly form of _E. coli_ after at least 24 people became infected and 5 of them ended up being hospitalized.

The 24 cases of _Escherichia coli_ O157 occurred between 12 Jul 2015 and 8 Aug 2015, with the "peak of illnesses" reported between 25 Jul 2015 and 1 Aug 2015, according a statement from PHAC. The source of the illnesses has not yet been identified, and the investigation is ongoing.

Most of those who became ill (63 percent) were male, had an average age of 24, and were located in the following 4 provinces: Alberta (1 case), Nova Scotia (2 cases), Ontario (7 cases) and Quebec (14 cases).

_E. coli_ O157 can lead to severe stomach cramps, watery or bloody diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, headache and slight fever. Symptoms usually occur within 10 days of coming into contact with the bacterium. "While most will recover completely, others may suffer permanent health effects, like kidney damage, and some may die," according to PHAC.

_E. coli_ O157 killed 7 people and sickened more than 2300 in 2000 in Walkerton, Ontario, where the drinking water supply was tainted. In March 2015, a cluster of a dozen _E. coli_ infections across Canada were thought to have been caused by contaminated leafy green vegetables, PHAC said at the time. The primary sources of _E. coli_ are raw or undercooked meat or dairy products, or fruits and vegetables that have come in contact with feces from infected animals.
