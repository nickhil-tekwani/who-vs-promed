Encephalitis, warning - Australia (NT) 20000414062504

Media release: 14 Apr 2000 Territory Health Services, Darwin Northern
Territory, Australia. This follows an earlier warning of sentinel chicken
seroconversion in Central Australia.

This morning [14 Apr 2000 a case of Australian Encephalitis (AE; [Murray
Valley encephalitis), [caused by a mosquito-transmitted [virus, was
confirmed in a 3-month old Central Australian child now hospitalised in
Adelaide. There are 6 other suspect cases, all from Central Australia, 2 of
whom have been transferred to Adelaide. Three of these suspected cases are
children 2 months to 4 years in age and the ages of the 3 suspect adults
range up to 70 years.
This highlights the continued warning to residents throughout the Territory
to be aware that there is widespread AE activity.
The areas most at risk presently are Victoria River region, Barkly and
Central Australian. This is due to exceptionally high numbers of the
transmitting mosquitoes there and the widespread detection of AE activity
in Alice Springs areas and Tennant Creek via the sentinal chicken surveillance.
In the Top End this year as in most years, AE viruses [Murray Valley
encephalitis and Kunjin viruses are seasonally detected in the sentinel
chickens and therefore all NT residents are at risk. The last case of AE
diagnosed in the NT was in 1993. All cases since 1987 have been detected
only between March and July.
Western Australia has also issued further warnings today following 4 cases
of AE diagnosed there and wide spread AE activity particularly in the
Gascoyne, Murchison, Kimberley and Pilbara.
Symptoms of AE include severe headache, neck stiffness, high fevers,
seizures (especially in young children) and in some cases progression to
delirium and coma. People experiencing these symptoms should seek medical
attention at once. People most at risk are babies, young children and
newcomers to the region via employment or travel.
Efforts to control mosquitoes and mosquito breeding sites are in place but
the area is so large and breeding sites so extensive or inaccessible that
effective mosquito control is not possible and commitment to personal
mosquito bite protection and providing protection for young children is
absolutely required There is no specific treatment and no vaccine for AE.

[Once again there is confusion regarding the etiologic agent of these
illnesses. I inserted "Murray Valley encephalitis" above, assuming the
etiologic agent of these first cases has been Murray Valley encephalitis
virus, not Kunjin virus. I don't suppose they call Murray Valley
encephalitis "Australian encephalitis" in Papua New Guinea or in other
non-Australian countries.
The statement "the widespread detection of AE activity in Alice Springs
areas and Tennant Creek via the sentinel chicken surveillance." is not a
correct one, strictly speaking. One cannot detect human encephalitis (i.e.,
what some Australians call "AE") caused by Murray Valley encephalitis or
Kunjin encephalitis viruses using chickens. One can only detect the
presence of these viruses, i.e., not human illness. This is what comes of
using poor terminology.
Still, this is a troubling report of a widespread distribution and
apparently (we have not seen comparative data) increased mosquito infection
rates and there likely will be more human infections before this is over
for the year.
Does anyone know whether Japanese encephalitis virus vaccine protects
against infection with Murray Valley encephalitis virus? My guess is that a
West Nile virus vaccine would protect against Kunjin virus infection. -
