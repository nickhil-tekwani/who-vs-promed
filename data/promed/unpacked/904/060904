The recent posting on California encephalitis in equines did have
significant weaknesses, as was so capably pointed out by Charlie Calisher
[California encephalitis, equine - USA (Louisiana) (04). However, I think
the possibility of encephalitis occurring in equines in North America due
to one or more members of the California (CAL) serogroup of viruses is very
real. I would like to relate our experiences in Canada with regards to
implicating the snowshoe hare (SSH) member of the CAL serogroup as a
pathogen of horses.
In July 1983, we demonstrated a seroconversion to CAL serogroup viruses
with highest titre to SSH virus by 3 serological tests (hemagglutination
inhibition, complement fixation and neutralization) in a symptomatic
yearling stallion in Ontario. We reported this in JAVMA (Volume 186, page
389, 1985) but knowing many horses in Ontario get exposed to CAL serogroup
viruses, we conservatively stated that it was unclear whether the
encephalitis in the horse was due to a CAL serogroup virus or whether the
viral infection was concurrent with illness due to another causative
factor. Subsequently we became more convinced of the involvement of the CAL
serogroup.
We documented a second seroconversion to a CAL serogroup virus closely
related or identical to SSH virus in a symptomatic yearling equine from
Saskatchewan in 1987 (reference: Heath et al. Can Vet J 30: 669-671,1989).
We found CAL serogroup antibodies in sera and CSF from numerous equines
with neurological signs in Ontario (reference: Keane et al Can J Vet Res
52: 229-235, 1988).
I hope any criticisms about the original posting of California encephalitis
in equines in Louisiana will not obscure the very real possibility of this
occurring. I would hate to see the baby thrown out with the bath water.
Based on our findings in Canada, I believe it is important we consider the
possibility of infection due to CAL serogroup viruses in equines presenting
with neurological signs in mosquito season. Given the concern over the
possibility of West Nile encephalitis in horses, we have a very real chance
of obtaining a significant amount of sera from symptomatic horses during
mosquito season. I would strongly encourage diagnosticians to include CAL
serogroup in their testing battery for all of these suspect equines.
