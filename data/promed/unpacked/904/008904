[ProMED-mail awaits more information regarding the source of this strain of _S._ Typhimurium strain with an unusual MLVA pattern. Multiple-locus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) is a method used to perform molecular typing of particular microorganisms. It utilizes the naturally occurring variation in the number of tandem repeated DNA sequences found in many different loci in the genome of a variety of organisms. - Mod.LL
