In this update:
South Korea, H5N1
New Case of Bird Flu Reported in Kyonggi Province
-----------------------------------------------------
The country reported another case of bird flu over the weekend at a
chicken farm in Yangju, Kyonggi Province. It is the 1st case in about
6 weeks.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry said on Sunday that chickens
at the farm tested positive for the highly contagious avian flu, or
H5N1 virus.
The case is the first of its kind since the bird flu was last
detected in Chonan, South Chungchong Province, 5 Feb 2004.
The new case was reported at a time when South Korea is recovering
from the bird flu shock, which had a devastating impact on the
poultry industry early in 2004, causing the consumption of chickens
and ducks to nose-dive.
According the ministry, local authorities in Kyonggi Province
immediately imposed quarantine measures on the Yangju farm in a bid
to prevent the virus from spreading to neighboring farms.
Over the weekend, the authorities sealed off areas within a 3-km
radius of the infected farm and slaughtered some 400 000 chickens in
the area. They are also recalling 1570 chickens that have already
been distributed in the market.
In a separate case, the ministry reported that some magpies were
found to have died of the avian flu in Yangsan, South Kyongsang
Province.
More than 3 million chickens and ducks have so far been slaughtered
and buried in South Korea since the nation first reported the
outbreak of the disease on 5 Dec 2004.
However, health officials reaffirmed that there is little chance for
bird flu to cross over to humans.
The H5N1 virus discovered in the country has a different genetic
sequence from the one found in Viet Nam and other Southeast Asian
countries.
