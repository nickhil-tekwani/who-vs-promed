For this year's [2020] World Mosquito Day, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) called attention to the "worrying" spread of _Anopheles stephensi_ -- an urban mosquito that spreads quickly in human-made habitats.

According to CDC, in recent years _A. stephensi_ has spread from its native habitat of Southern Asia to Eastern Africa, where its arrival in Djibouti was followed by a "startling increase" in urban malaria cases. "The simultaneous emergence of _A. stephensi_ and the rise in urban malaria cases raises the possibility that the newly introduced species is responsible for increased malaria transmission," CDC said.

There were 228 million cases of malaria worldwide in 2018, including 405 000 deaths, according to CDC. There are an estimated 3000 types of mosquitos, covering a wide variety of different habitats and feeding on people and animals.

"The introduction of any new mosquito into an area with malaria is a concern," CDC said. "The fact that _A. stephensi_ occupies a different niche from _Anopheles arabiensis_" -- a primary vector of malaria in Eastern Africa -- "means that public health workers may need to carry out more intensive mosquito control in urban areas."

[This above report is recognition of a publication in CDC's Emerging Infectious Disease journal in July 2019 (reference below) expressing concern about the invasion of Ethiopia and Djibouti by the Asian urban malaria vector mosquito _Anopheles stephensi_. This report states, "In 2016, _An. stephensi_ mosquitoes were found for the 1st time in Ethiopia, where this species has since become established (6). This discovery followed earlier reports of the species in neighboring Djibouti (7). _An. stephensi_ mosquitoes are native to southern and western Asia, where the species serves as an efficient malaria vector (8). Unlike other malaria vectors in Africa, _An. stephensi_ mosquitoes are found not only in rural areas but also in cities, where they breed in manmade water containers, such as household water storage containers and garden reservoirs. The _An. stephensi_ mosquito is considered to be the main malaria vector in urban centers in India and Pakistan (8). Recently, the species was recorded for the 1st time in Sri Lanka, demonstrating its ability to disperse across large bodies of water and establish successfully in new geographic regions (9).

"Because Africa currently does not have a malaria vector adapted to urban centers, establishment of _An. stephensi_ mosquitoes on the continent poses considerable health risks. If the species disperses beyond its current distribution in eastern Ethiopia and successfully invades large cities, such as Khartoum, Sudan; Mombasa, Kenya; and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, the region could face malaria outbreaks of unprecedented size. Because of relatively high levels of malaria prevalence in persons of all ages in rural areas, high mobility between rural and urban areas, and inadequate healthcare, countries in Africa are unprepared to deal with rapid spread of malaria in their cities and towns by a vector species well adapted to urban infrastructures."

If control of this urban mosquito proves to be as difficult as control of the urban _Aedes aegypti_ has, eradication will not be possible with current technology, and control will be costly in countries with limited resources.
