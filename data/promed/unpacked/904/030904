African swine fever rampant in North Ossetia
--------------------------------------------
The spread of African swine fever [ASF] in Northern Ossetia can pose
a worse threat than avian flu. More than 1500 animals have already
died as a result of this disease. In spite of the state of emergency
declared in Northern Ossetia, the spread continues. Experts predict
that the disease will soon cover the whole country without effective
means to control it.

The 1st cases of this exotic disease have been recorded also in the
Orenburg region, and there is danger of the disease, carried by
swine, [mechanically] by humans, animal feed and transport [vehicles].

Astrakhan veterinarians are already preparing for the possible
advance of the deadly disease, and local officials there have
increased security measures. The authorities are applying a radical
approach, appealing to the local population with the proposal, as a
matter of urgency, to slaughter their pigs and immediately consume their meat.

Bashkiria introduced quarantine
-------------------------------
ASF has spread into the Orenburg area, where 300 swine have [as of 5
Aug 2008] died. Since Bashkiria borders Orenburg, Komsomolskaya
Pravda newspaper staff tried to find out what is the risk for
Bashkiria to get the virus from neighbors. They report that
quarantine and checkposts have been operated cooperatively by the
Veterinary Service and the police on Orenburg's borders. Since 25 Jul
2008, no imports of animal products and vegetables have been allowed.
These measures will remain in force for at least a month.

It is underlined that ASF does not infect humans.

[Since our previous posting on the ASF situation in the Caucasus,
subscribers have become -- due to unfortunate circumstances -- more
familiar with the region's geography and political divisions; see map at
<http://www.colorado.edu/ibs/waroutcomes/pics/ethnicMap.jpg>.

Since mid 2007, ASF has spread throughout Abkhazia, Georgia (most
probably including South Ossetia), Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh,
Chechnia, North Ossetia and Orenburg. The latter -- more than 1000
km (620 miles) distant from North Ossetia -- illustrates the
potential of the disease to spread further.

The prospects of controlling the disease, meager anyway, have become
even worse due to the severe deterioration of the political situation
in the region. If refugees take with them pigs and pork, the pace of
the virus' spread will be enhanced. - Mod.AS]
