Bluetongue serotype 8 in Norway
-------------------------------
In late February 2009, bluetongue virus infection (serotype 8) was
detected for the 1st time in Norway. 2 bovine dairy herds in the
county of Vest-Agder were tested positive after analyses of bulk milk
samples collected in December 2008. The samples were collected in a
routine BTV surveillance program. None of the positive animals have
displayed clinical signs of the disease.

Following the initial detection of BTV, 3370 farms have been sampled.
Approximately 2800 bovine bulk milk samples, 8872 blood samples from
cattle and 16 516 blood samples from sheep and goats revealed BTV
infection in 2 additional cattle herds in the counties of Vest-Agder
and Aust-Agder in southern Norway. In total, 31 animals have been
tested positive for antibodies against BTV, and 28 of these were
positive using rRT-PCR.

Herd/ No of animals/ Positive antibodies/Positive PCR
Herd L/ 64/ 25/ 24
Herd K/ 51/ 3/ 3
Herd U/ 74/ 1/ 1
Herd N/ 430/ 2/ 0

A total of 25 of the 32 seropositive animals were from farm L, and 24
of these were rRT-PCR positive with CT values ranging from 24 to 37.
Viral RNA was detected by rRT-PCR in 2 calves in this herd. One calf
born 13 Aug 2008 had CT values of 35 on 6 Mar 2009 and of 34 on 30
Mar 2009. The other calf, born 29 Dec 2008, had CT values of 24 and
27 on the respective dates. Results from the latter calf indicate
transplacental transmission of virus and it seems to have stayed
viraemic for more than 3 months. This would imply that the virus can
survive the winter period even in areas with a relatively long vector
free season.

For 2008-2009, the vector free period in Norway has been defined from
7 Nov 2008 to 15 Apr 2009. This long period, combined with a
relatively low density of susceptible animals, and limited trade of
live animals, makes the situation in Norway different from many other
European countries. With the present situation of only 4 positive
herds, the Norwegian authorities have chosen a control strategy based
on surveillance, and culling of high risk animals. High risk animals
are defined as seropositive animals expected to calf before 10 Jun
2009, and their offspring. At the moment this amounts to 6 cows and 3 calves.

Any decision to change strategy and initiate vaccination will be
based on a continuous evaluation of the risk of spread of the
disease. Results from serological and entomological surveillance,
combined with meteorological data and time of the year, will be taken
into consideration.

The source of the bluetongue outbreak is unknown. Bluetongue was
detected in Denmark and Sweden in 2008. The overseas distance from
the location of the northernmost outbreak in Denmark (Ringkobing),
and the distance from the closest outbreak in Sweden (Varberg), to
the seropositive herds in Norway are both approximately 250 km [155
miles]. Both Denmark and Sweden have initiated extensive vaccination programs.
