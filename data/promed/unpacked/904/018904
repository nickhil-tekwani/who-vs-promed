[Both of these pathogens can cause severe disease in their respective
crops. _Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_ , a bacterial
pathogen, causes the serious potato ring rot disease, which requires strict
sanitation measures for disease management. Plum pox disease, also called
sharka, infects many stone fruits such as plum, peach, almond, cherry, and
apricot, causing severe malformation and discoloration of fruit and
consequent economic losses. More information on these two pathogens can be
obtained at the following URLs:
