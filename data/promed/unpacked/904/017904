Epidemiological comments
------------------------
The premises where the disease was diagnosed is in the Fraser Valley
in the province of British Columbia, where an important event of
highly pathogenic avian influenza occurred in 2004. British Columbia
is located at the westernmost limit of Canada.

Birds from this farm were submitted by the veterinary private
practitioner to the Animal Health Centre (AHC - British Columbia
Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries) as a routine submission
for a respiratory related problem with no significant mortality. The
AHC is a member of the Canadian Avian Influenza Laboratory Network.
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) National Center for
Foreign Animal Diseases confirmed the diagnosis (conventional PCR H5
positive) on samples initially processed by the AHC.

Results of gene sequencing indicate a low path cleavage site
(NVPQRETR/GLFGAIA). The sequence is 99 percent related to another H5
virus (H5N2) from California in 2007. Closest match in Genbank is
A/American green-winged teal/ California/HKWF609/2007(H5N2),
accession number: CY033444

Additional tests are underway. The index premises and all premises
within 3 km [1.86 miles] of this premises have been placed under
quarantine. Trace out investigations are underway and all significant
contacts will also be quarantined. Surveillance and control
activities have started in accordance with the CFIA Notifiable Avian
Influenza Hazard Specific Plan.

Note by the OIE Animal Health Information Department: H5 and H7 avian
influenza in its low pathogenic form in poultry is a notifiable
disease as per Chapter 10.4. on avian influenza of the Terrestrial
Animal Health Code (2008).

Control measures
----------------
Measures applied:
Quarantine

[ProMED wonders if they are contemplating culling all nearly 60,000
birds? Canada slaughtered 13.7 million poultry in the 2004 HPAI scare
