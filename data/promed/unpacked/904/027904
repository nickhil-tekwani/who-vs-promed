Bird flu virus spreads to Papua
-----------------------------------
The bird flu virus has now reached easternmost Papua after attacking
poultry populations in Java and Sumatra in the western section of the
country. [Papua is the eastern of the 2 provinces in Indonesia's
Western New Guinea. Indonesia officially reported to the OIE, on 24
Apr 2006, an outbreak in the other province within Western New
Guinea, namely Irian Jawa Barat, to the northwest of Papua. This
outbreak had started in March 2006, affecting "traditionally raised
native chickens" in the Manokwari regency. See commentary below as
well as archived post 20060518.1398 and
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/aIS_21.htm#Sec2>.

About 174 chickens are believed to have died of the H5N1 virus in
Mimika regency as of 11 Jul 2006, while 414 others were culled due to
suspected infection. [Map at <http://www.answers.com/topic/westpapua1-png>].
Based on a lab analysis from the Bogor Veterinary Research Center
conducted on 19 Jul 2006, 3 of 37 birds tested were positive for
H5N1, an official said Monday [7 Aug 2006].
"Test results showed that 3 of the chickens contain the H5N1 virus;
one of them was from SP3 Timika Jaya and 2 were from the traditional
market," head of the Papua Husbandry Office AR Pintadewa told The
Jakarta Post in Jayapura.
According to Pintadewa, officers from the Mimika Husbandry Office
received a report from a farmer in Sempan village, Timika, on 11 Jul
2006 that his chickens were sick.
They found 40 birds with H5N1 symptoms at the farm.
Inspections of the traditional market also found many chickens with
symptoms of the disease.
"The place was immediately treated with disinfectant, and chickens
showing clinical symptoms of infection with the virus were culled to
prevent an outbreak ..."
He said most vulnerable to the virus were the Indonesian Thai game
variety, known locally as ayam Bangkok, that came from outside
Timika. "We are still examining where they came from. The virus can
be spread by air."
To prevent the spread of the virus to other areas, Pintadewa said the
Mimika regent issued a circular banning transportation of chickens
out of the regency.

[New Guinea, the world's 2nd largest island after Greenland, is
politically divided into independent (east) and Indonesian (west)
territories. The eastern, independent (since 1975) territory is Papua
New Guinea; the western, Indonesian territory is divided (since 2003)
into 2 provinces: West Irian Jaya and Papua; map at
