Rabbit collected from Cape May County tests positive for deadly disease
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
A 1-year-old spayed female rabbit tested positive for Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus Type 2, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service said Friday [13 May 2022].

Known as RHDV2, the infection is a foreign animal disease caused by multiple virus strains. It is highly contagious and can be fatal to domestic and wild rabbits.

It cannot, however, be transmitted from animals to humans, the department said.

The rabbit death's reportedly happened [8 May 2022]. A laboratory test confirmed the infection on [12 May 2022], the department said.

Another rabbit from the premises also died from what is being considered potentially RHDV2 related, the department said.

Another rabbit on the premises has been quarantined and isn't showing the disease's signs, the department said.

The outbreak's source has not yet been identified, and there is no evidence of infection in other locations, the department said.

[This illness does not affect human beings but can be quite lethal to rabbits. Other rabbit diseases may affect human beings.

In the 1980s, European rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_) populations were devastated by a virus that caused an extremely lethal and highly contagious disease, rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD). The 1st outbreak of this new disease was reported in 1984 in China's Jiangsu Province within a group of commercially-bred Angora rabbits imported from Germany. As the virus spread worldwide, naturally occurring RHD outbreaks were reported in geographically distant regions, such as Cuba, Uruguay, and Reunion Island.

RHD is a highly pathogenic lagovirus endemic in Europe and Australasian populations of the European rabbit, _O. cuniculus_. It has also caused several unexplained disease outbreaks in domestic European rabbits in North America. The disease has also spilled to wild cottontail rabbits and jackrabbits.

RHD is characterized by high morbidity and high mortality (70-90%) in European rabbits, and spreads very rapidly by direct and indirect transmission. Infection can occur by nasal, conjunctival or oral routes. Transmission of RHD is facilitated by the high stability of the virus in the environment. Lesions are primary liver necrosis and a massive disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in all organs and tissues. The most severe lesions are in the liver, trachea and lungs.

In 2010, a new genotype of RHD (RHD-2) emerged, and where it propagated it replaced the original strain. This new variant causes lethal infections also in juvenile (<2 months old) and RHD-vaccinated rabbits. After its 1st detection in France, RHD-2 spread rapidly and infections were reported in several European countries, North America, the Middle East, and Australia.

This disease, as mentioned earlier is extremely lethal to rabbits and can spread exceedingly easily.

If you have rabbits, carefully watch your animals for any signs of illness. This disease can kill the animal rapidly. It spreads very rapidly by direct and indirect transmission. Infection can occur by nasal, conjunctival, or oral routes. If you own or work with rabbits, do not visit other facilities, or friends having rabbits. Take biosecurity measures to protect your animals. Avoid interacting with rabbits other than your own. - Mod.PMB/TG
