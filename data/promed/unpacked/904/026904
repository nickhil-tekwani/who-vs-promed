[2] Chikungunya and dengue virus co-infections

Dengue and Chikungunya co-infection associated with more severe clinical disease than mono-infection.

Abstract
Background: Dengue and chikungunya infections appear to be increasing in India. While _Aedes aegypti_ is the transmitting vector for both viruses, and co-infection occurs in the same communities, studies on the clinical significance of co-infection are limited.

Materials and Methods: We conducted a retrospective case-control analysis of consecutive hospitalized patients presenting with febrile illness to the Sassoon General Hospital/BJ Medical College in Pune, India, who were screened for serologic evidence of dengue and chikungunya [virus] infection. Fischer's Exact test and Mann-Whitney test were used to compare mortality and morbidity between patients with dual and mono-infection.

Morbidity outcomes included lowest blood pressure (in 1st 5 days of admission), requirement for intensive care and mechanical ventilation, blood product transfusion requirement, as well as complete blood count.

Result: Co-infected patients had a higher overall mortality than mono-infected patients (12 percent vs. 2 percent, p=0.04). Requirement for mechanical ventilation and number of blood units transfused were greater for co-infected vs. mono- infected patients (2 percent vs. 0 percent, p = 0.02 and median 6 vs. 4 units, p=0.03, respectively).

Conclusion: Our study suggests that dual infection with dengue and chikungunya viruses is associated with more severe clinical disease than mono infection. Further studies are required to determine whether our findings are associated with simultaneous or sequential co-infections, as well as to study the underlying pathogenesis of this association.

[This study provides evidence that co-infection by dengue and chikungunya viruses results in more severe disease than infection by just one of these viruses. It would have been interesting to know whether these patients had experienced a previous dengue virus infection, with the possibility of immune enhancement adding to the severity of the observed disease. However, the retrospective design precluded that opportunity. - Mod.TY]
