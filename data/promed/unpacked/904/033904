Thailand: death of mother attributed to person to person transmission
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Thai health authorities are trying to find out whether a girl passed the
avian influenza A (H5N1) virus to her mother [and] aunt. They are anxiously
awaiting test results from [the mother] who died on Monday -- possibly from
avian influenza virus infection. They fear she could be the first case of
human to human [transmission of] infection. "This is quite a big issue and
crucial to confirming the existence of human to human infection [of avian
influenza]," said Dr Charal Trinwuthipong, acting permanent secretary of
the Public Health Ministry and director-general of the Disease Control
Department.
If test results confirm that the 26 year old woman [was infected by avian
influenza A (H5N1) virus], it means the virus has mutated and can be passed
from human to human, he said, adding that the woman had not been in contact
with infected animals. The woman fell ill and died in Nonthaburi about a
week after having close physical contact with her 11 year old daughter, who
died of symptoms similar to avian influenza virus infection on 12 Sep 2004,
Charal said. The girl died after a week in hospital. The mother was with
her the entire time, he said.
The girl's aunt was also ill with flu-like symptoms, he said, adding that
she had also not [been in contact with any] infected poultry. [Henry Niman
has added a note to indicate that the aunt is still alive].
Charal said the chances of detecting the H5N1 virus in the mother are
rather slim. Her body has already been injected with formalin. The girl had
not been listed as a suspected bird flu case until her mother died, said Dr
Wirat Phuthi-methee, Kamphaeng Phet's chief health officer.
The authorities have also unearthed another suspected case, a 13 year old
boy living in Khanu Woralak-saburi, the same district the girl lived in.
The boy died last Monday [21 Sep 2004], said Nakhon Sawan health chief
officer Dr Buares Sriprataksa. Wirat conceded that the 2 children had not
been listed as suspected cases earlier due to lax screening measures.
Hospitals might not have been aware they could have been infected with
avian influenza virus. Doctors failed to ask if they had been in contact
with dead chickens due to the fact their homes were not in designated bird
flu control areas.
Public health minister Sudarat Keyuraphan has now ordered all hospitals to
use comprehensive screening measures on every patient and to ask if they
had touched birds or lived in the areas where poultry had died. "We can no
longer just wait for updates of new control areas from the Livestock
Development Department]," she said. The minister will today lead a team of
health officials on a visit to Kamphaeng Phet. She also ordered urgent
disinfecting of areas in the province suspected of having the bird flu
virus. Test results of the 4 cases, except the girl, who has already been
cremated, are expected in 3 days.

[I am indebted to Nati Elkin <Elkin@poultrymed.com> for pointing out that
the WHO website currently lists 13 confirmed cases of avian influenza A
(H5N1) virus infection in Thailand, 9 of whom have died. If the 4 suspected
cases described above are confirmed the total would become 17, 12 of whom
have died.

Thailand: statement by WHO representative on possibility of human to human
transmission
--------------------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization said on Sat 25 Sep 2004 that it was
"suspecting human to human transmission" of avian influenza virus had
occurred in northern Thailand, marking what could be the first such
transmission of this virus. From the existing data we are suspecting human
to human transmission of avian influenza virus, WHO's acting Thailand
representative Kumara Rai told Agence France Presse after studying
information from Kamphaeng Phet province where the deaths of a girl and boy
are suspected to have been caused by avian influenza virus. The 11 year old
girl's mother, who lived near Bangkok but traveled north to visit her
daughter in hospital and then attend her funeral, returned to the Thai
capital where she too fell ill and died. Her death is also on the suspect list.
[Avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection] is suspected but has not been
confirmed in these cases, and laboratory tests on the 3 fatalities, as well
as of the girl's aunt (who has been admitted to hospital with severe
pneumonia), were being conducted to determine whether they carried the
virus. Rai said the WHO was "very much concerned, but we are awaiting
laboratory confirmation", which is expected as early as Mon 27 Sep 2004. He
said he had contacted the UN health agency's headquarters in Geneva to urge
them to send experts to Thailand to assist in the field investigation.
The avian influenza A (H5N1) virus has killed 28 [29 according to WHO as of
9 Sep 2004 - Mod.CP] people in Vietnam and Thailand this year in 2 waves of
Asian outbreaks which also caused the death or culling of more than 100
million chickens. WHO fears H5N1 could mutate into a highly contagious form
that triggers a global human flu pandemic. When asked if a confirmed virus
leap between humans in the Thai cases would mark the first step in such a
feared mutation, Rai said "I think so." Health ministry officials have
confirmed the girl and the 13 year old boy in Kamphaeng Phet had come into
contact with their households' chickens that fell ill and died, but Rai and
others have said it was not clear whether the mother and the aunt had
contact with the animals. On Fri 24 Sep 2004 Rai met with field
epidemiologists, Thai-based officials from the US Centers for Disease
Control, and senior Thai health ministry officials to establish whether the
women had come into contact with fowl.
"We are still almost firm [sure? - Mod.SH] that there was no contacts with
sick birds," Rai said. Thailand has been put on full bird flu alert as a
precautionary measure, said health minister Sudarat Keyuraphan, who along
with other officials has acknowledged that concern has mounted that the
mother and aunt may have contracted bird flu directly from the girl.
Sudarat sought to downplay fears, stressing that preliminary tests on the
aunt had not confirmed avian influenza virus infection.

[It seems premature to conclude that person to person transmission of avian
influenza virus may have occurred, while it still has to be confirmed
unequivocally that avian influenza virus was responsible for the deaths of
any of the 3 deceased. Tests on the surviving patient appear to have been
negative so far. - Mod.CP
ProMED-mail is grateful to all who have sent us information about these
developments. We now await the definitive diagnosis, which we hope will be
available by Monday. Readers may find the Thai Ministry of Public Health
