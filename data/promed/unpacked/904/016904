In 9 days, outbreaks of bluetongue increased by 300 percent, from 26 on 16 Aug to 104 today [25 Aug 2021]. The news was given by Coldiretti Sardegna [National Confederation of Direct Farmers, Sardinia] who underlined how "these numbers and the speed with which it is expanding tell us that it is not the time for controversy but for the responsibility in which damage must be minimized by avoiding the repetition of stories that made us shiver in the recent past and that we would no longer like to see".

The new epidemic started in the 1st 10 days of August in Bari Sardo on 2 farms. After 20 days it concerns 32 municipalities (mainly involving the provinces of Nuoro and Ogliastra and Oristano), 28 404 animals affected, with 2290 presenting symptoms and 107 deaths. There are also 12 suspected outbreaks, involving 2198 animals of which 13 present symptoms.

"The sudden increase of outbreaks is evidence that bluetongue disease is spreading like wildfire" -- says the president of Coldiretti Sardegna Battista Cualbu. "This means that now it is necessary to concentrate efforts to stop the disease and start to vaccinate where not yet done, in the areas most at risk."

"With an immediate and massive intervention, it is possible to limit the damage avoiding losses and images that in the recent past have hurt everyone -- according to the director of Coldiretti Sardegna Luca Saba. At the same time, however, it is necessary to program reimbursements for farmers who have suffered the loss of sheep."

In case vaccination is not completed urgently, the BTV-4 strain is expected to continue its spread in Sardinia throughout the remaining summer and early fall months, during which the vectors are (seasonally) active. The Sarda local breed of dairy sheep, which counted 2 317 000 lactating ewes as of 31 Dec 2019, is known to be highly susceptible to bluetongue.

The following summary on bluetongue is derived from OIE's terrestrial Manual (chapter 3.1.3), for subscribers' convenience:

"Bluetongue (BT) is an infectious, primarily vector-borne viral disease that affects wild and domestic ruminants such as sheep, goats, cattle, buffaloes, deer and most species of African antelope, and camelids as vertebrate hosts. The virus is primarily transmitted between susceptible vertebrate hosts by competent species of _Culicoides_ midges, and the global distribution of the disease is largely determined by the distribution of competent vectors. Infection with bluetongue virus (BTV) is inapparent in the vast majority of animals but can cause fatal disease in a proportion of infected sheep, deer, and wild ruminants. Infection of cattle is usually subclinical, with the exception of BTV-8 infection. Cattle are particularly significant in the epidemiology of the disease due to the prolonged viraemia that occurs following infection. When apparent, clinical signs of BT are mainly attributable to an increase in vascular permeability and include fever, hyperaemia and congestion, facial oedema and haemorrhages, erosion of the mucous membranes, coronitis and laminitis, and pleural and pericardial haemorrhages.

"BTV is the type member of the _Orbivirus_ genus of the family Reoviridae. There are 27 recognised BTV serotypes and several recently isolated but as yet unclassified unique 'atypical' strains. Virus serotype identification traditionally requires isolation and amplification of the virus in embryonated chicken eggs, _Culicoides_ cells or other tissue culture, and the subsequent application of serogroup- and serotype-specific tests including virus neutralisation assays. The reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay has permitted rapid amplification of BTV cDNA in clinical samples and well validated real-time RT-PCR-based systems for virus detection are now routine, allowing for more rapid and sensitive diagnostic testing. The combination of RT-PCR amplification and capillary sequencing or whole genome sequencing now offers relatively rapid unequivocal agent identification at the genome level. Collectively, these procedures augment the classical virological techniques to provide information on virus serogroup, serotype, and topotype".

BTV-4 has recently been recorded in sentinel animals on the Balearic Islands (Mallorca), a Spanish territory located about 450 km (about 280 mi) west of south Sardinia (see map at http://tinyurl.com/a2xvpzsh). It will be interesting to note if both events involve a similar topotype; both may have been affected by infected wind-borne _Culicoides_ midges originating in North Africa. A recent outbreak in Algeria has not yet been serotyped (20210810.8584084). - Mod.AS
