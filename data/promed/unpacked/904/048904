A second-within-a-week case of anthrax has been recorded in Kazakshtan. An
official in the republican Agency for Emergencies told Itar-Tass on
Thursday that Natalya Koval, 68, a local resident, had been placed at the
hospital of the town of Karatau, the district centre of Jambul region, with
an anthrax diagnosis. The woman got infected when dressing the meat of a
sick animal.
The patient applied for medical aid to the local polyclinic, complaining
about indisposition and following an examination by a district
practitioner, was urgently hospitalised. She now undergoes an intensive
therapy course and her health is out of danger. Several people, who had
direct contact with her, are under medical supervision.
A team of veterinarians and epidemiologists has left for the town to
monitor the epidemiological situation. They will take measures to prevent
this dangerous disease. Experts believe that the infection was provoked by
failure to observe elementary rules of veterinary supervision, by
anti-sanitary conditions and disregard for medical recommendations.
The first such case was recorded on September 21, when Dmitry Belyayev, 23,
a resident of Kaskabulak township, was brought to the Karatau hospital with
the same diagnosis. The disease was caused by the eating of infected beef.

[Karatau is close to the Kyrgyzstan border in SE Kazakhstan. From the road
density in the area it must have a significant local population. Although
the Itar-Tass report hints at enteric anthrax the outbreak characteristics
so far are more typical of cutaneous anthrax. As it usually takes two-three
people to slaughter, dress and butcher a steer or cow, we may presume that
the other people mentioned above were similarly occupied as anthrax is not
a contagious disease. The Itar-Tass reporter was misinformed or
mistranslated on this. - MHJ
