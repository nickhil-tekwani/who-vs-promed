A human infective nematode found in remote northern areas of Australia has been identified in canine carriers for the 1st time [in Australia].

Flinders University environmental health researchers, with experts in the USA, have found a form of the soil-borne strongyloides worm in faeces collected from dogs.

Strongyloidiasis, carried by several kinds of _Strongyloides_ spp., is estimated to infect up to 370 million people around the world, mainly in places with poor sanitation in developing or disadvantaged communities.

The infection in the gut remains hidden but can cause abdominal pain, diarrhoea and bloating. Some people may experience nausea, vomiting, weight loss, weakness or constipation, but doctors may not check for the condition. In chronic infections, skin and chest symptoms can persist, but the condition often goes unchecked.

In the Australian study, 273 dog faeces samples compared to 4 human samples were screened using real-time PCR, of which 47 dog and 4 human DNA samples were then amplified by conventional PCR with further sequencing. The complete set of amplified sequence variants (ASVs) was then analysed.

"Ultimately, we were able to confirm for the 1st time potentially zoonotic _S. stercoralis_ populations are present in Australia and suggest dogs might represent a potential reservoir of human strongyloidiasis in remote Australian communities," says Flinders PhD candidate Mira Beknazarova.

"Our study was able to independently support previous reports of at least 2 genetically distinct groups of _S. stercoralis_; one infecting both dogs and humans, and another group is specific to dogs," she says.

Flinders University environmental health senior lecturer Dr Kirstin Ross, who regularly consults with remote Indigenous communities in Australia, says the study does not show direct transmission from dogs to humans, or vice-versa, but builds on the need for further investigations into preventative measures including better sanitation.

"Much needs to be done if you consider the risk to older and younger residents of Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities in northern Australia who are at risk of infection," says Dr Ross, who has studied strongyloidiasis for many years.

"The latest results strongly support moves to treat both humans and dogs for the infection," she says.

The Australian study is similar to a separate study in Cambodia where _Strongyloides_ sp, was found in dog faeces.

The infective form of the worm, the larva, lives in soil that has been contaminated by faeces of an infected person. If a person comes into contact with this soil, the larvae can burrow through the person's skin and make its way to the lungs and then the gut where they eventually become adult worms.

Testing and treating for the larvae in human blood or faeces is often delayed by the slow acceleration of symptoms.

[In human beings, strongyloidiasis is a disease caused by a nematode, or a roundworm, in the genus _Strongyloides_ spp. Though there are over 40 species within this genus that can infect birds, reptiles, amphibians, livestock and other primates, _Strongyloides stercoralis_ is the primary species accounting for human disease. It sometimes infects primates, dogs and cats, and some dog and primate infecting strains have been shown to be capable of causing human infection. We do not know if cat-infecting strains can infect humans or not. The larvae are small; the longest reach about 600 um in length, making them very difficult to see with the naked eye.

_Strongyloides stercoralis_ is classified as a soil-transmitted helminth. This means that the primary mode of infection is through contact with soil that is contaminated with free-living larvae. When the larvae come in contact with skin, they are able to penetrate it and migrate through the body, eventually finding their way to the small intestine where they burrow and lay their eggs. Unlike other soil-transmitted helminths such as hookworm and whipworm, whose eggs do not hatch until they are in the environment, the eggs of _S. stercoralis_ hatch into larvae in the intestine. Most of these larvae will be excreted in the stool, but some of the larvae may mature and immediately re-infect the host either by burrowing into the intestinal wall, or by penetrating the skin around the anus. This characteristic of _S. stercoralis_ is termed auto-infection. The significance of auto-infection is that unless treated for _S. stercoralis_, persons may remain infected throughout their lifetime.

In addition to contact with soil and auto-infection, there have been rare cases of person-to-person transmission in the following:

**Organ transplantation
**Institutions for people with cognitive disability requiring assistance with daily living
**Long-term care facilities
**Daycare centers

Most people do not know when their exposure occurred. For those who do, a local rash can occur immediately. The cough usually occurs several days later. Abdominal symptoms typically occur approximately 2 weeks later, and larvae can be found in the stool about 3 to 4 weeks later.

The best way to prevent _Strongyloides_ spp. infection is to wear shoes when you are walking on soil, avoid contact with fecal matter or sewage, and clean up after dogs. Proper sewage disposal and fecal management are keys to prevention.

The life cycle of _Strongyloides_ is basically comprised of 2 parts: a free-living cycle outside of the host as rhabditiform larvae and a parasitic life cycle as infective filariform larvae (filariae). During the free-living cycle in the soil, _Strongyloides_ transform from rhabditiform larvae into infective filariform larvae, which penetrate the human skin and proceed into the submucosa, then into the venous circulation, and then toward the right heart and lungs. During the maturation process, _Strongyloides_ larvae induce alveolar capillary bleeding and potent eosinophilic inflammation, resulting in eosinophilic pneumonitis. From the alveoli, the larvae continue to migrate up the pulmonary tree and trachea. The cough reflex helps to push the larvae out of the bronchial tree and trachea. However, once the larvae reach the larynx, they are swallowed and travel to the stomach and small bowel. Inside the GI tract, _Strongyloides_ larvae mature into diminutive adult females that measure approximately one tenth of one inch (i.e. 220-250 um). Adult female worms embed themselves in the mucosa of the small bowel and produce eggs via parthenogenesis. Within the intestinal lumen, the eggs hatch into noninfective rhabditiform larvae, which are excreted, along with stool, into the environment (i.e. soil).

In dogs, _Strongyloides stercoralis_ is a small, slender nematode that when fully mature is about 2 mm long, located at the base of the villi in the anterior half of the small intestine of dogs and cats. The worms are almost transparent and all but impossible to see grossly at necropsy. Usually, infections are associated with warm, wet, crowded, unsanitary housing. The species found most often in dogs is identical to that found in people.

The parasitic worms are all females. The eggs embryonate rapidly, and most larvae hatch before being passed in the feces. Under appropriate conditions of warmth and moisture, development in the environment is rapid; the third larval stage may be reached in little more than a day. Some of these larvae develop into infective filariform larvae; others develop into free-living worms that mate and produce progeny similar to that of the parasitic female. The filariform larvae penetrate the skin but also may infect a host via ingestion. Transmammary transmission is possible. Progeny may be shed in the feces 7-10 days after infection. Autoinfection caused by larvae that developed to the infective stage within the GI tract can result in infections in which dogs shed larvae for lengthy periods.

The presence of clinical signs indicates that a heavy infection has been building up for some weeks. A blood-streaked, mucoid diarrhea, usually seen in young animals during hot humid weather, is characteristic. Emaciation is often prominent, and reduced growth rate may be one of the first signs. Appetite usually is good, and the dog is normally active in the earlier stages of the disease. In the absence of concurrent secondary infections, there is little or no fever. Usually in advanced stages, there is shallow, rapid breathing and fever, and the prognosis is grave. Autoinfection may be induced by the use of corticosteroids or other factors that affect immunocompetence. There may be larvae in tissues, and these dogs are more likely to die. At necropsy, there can be evidence of verminous pneumonia with large areas of consolidation in the lungs as well as marked enteritis with hemorrhage, mucosal exfoliation, and much secretion of mucus.

Poor sanitation and mixing of susceptible with infected dogs can lead to a rapid buildup of the infection in all dogs in a kennel or pen. Dogs with diarrhea should be promptly isolated from dogs that appear healthy. Direct sunlight, increased soil or surface temperatures, and desiccation are deleterious to all free larval stages. Thorough washing of wooden and impervious surfaces with steam or concentrated salt or lime solutions, followed by rinsing with hot water, effectively destroys the parasite. Because the disease in people can be serious, caution should be exercised when handling infected dogs. The disease in people (as in dogs) is much more likely to be severe if the person is immunosuppressed.

Infections in dogs can be treated with ivermectin (0.2 mg/kg, SC or PO, once, with a 2nd dose 4 weeks later; 0.8 mg/kg, PO, once), fenbendazole (50 mg/kg/day, PO, for 5 days, repeated 4 weeks later), or thiabendazole (100-150 mg/kg/day, PO, for 3 days, repeated weekly until larvae are not detected in feces; toxicity may be seen with this regimen). In cats, fenbendazole (50 mg/kg/day, PO, for 3 days) can be used. These are not approved regimens in either cats or dogs. In all animals, feces should be examined regularly for at least 6 months after treatment to confirm efficacy.

Clearly, this situation has been known in other countries for some time. However, it appears this is the 1st time it has been associated with indigenous people and dogs in Australia.

Likely a similar situation exists in other countries and indigenous people. Sanitation of areas where dogs and people are, as well as avoidance as much as possible of contaminated waters, seem to be key to avoiding this situation. If contaminated water must be walked through, a sturdy pair of shoes may be helpful in preventing this disease.

_Strongyloides stercoralis_ is a nematode which easily infects humans and can remain asymptomatic in the human host for decades. It can cause a fulminant, fatal infection in immunocompromised persons. - Mod.TG
