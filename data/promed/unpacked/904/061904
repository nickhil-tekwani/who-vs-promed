FEVER & BIRDWATCHING - SEYCHELLES, TANZANIA (10)
================================================

In one previous response to the FUO after traveling to the Seychelles
incident, the possibility of leptospirosis was raised. Since
leptospirosis is very common in the Seychelles and I believe they had
an outbreak last year, was a leptospirosis serology ever done?
