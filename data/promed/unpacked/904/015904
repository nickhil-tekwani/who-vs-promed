Africa has documented 1597 suspected cases of monkeypox since the start of 2022, of which 66 have been fatal, the acting director of Africa's top public health agency Ahmed Ogwell Ouma said on Thursday [16 Jun 2022].

The disease has not yet been contained on the continent, he said, adding that when a smallpox vaccination campaign starts to contain monkeypox worldwide it should begin in Africa.

"Our position is that vaccination is an important tool and needs to start here in Africa," Ouma said during a weekly briefing by the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.

"Here... the burden is larger, the risk higher and the geographical spread is also broader," he said.

African countries that have reported confirmed cases are Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Congo Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria, Morocco, Ghana, Liberia and Sierra Leone, Ouma said.

The World Health Organization is due to convene an emergency committee next week to assess whether the monkeypox outbreak represents a public health emergency of international concern.

Monkeypox is endemic in parts of Africa. More than 30 countries where the viral disease is not endemic have reported outbreaks this year [2022], most of them in Europe.

Epidemiological summary
- Since September 2017, Nigeria has continued to report sporadic cases of monkeypox (MPX).

- On 26 May 2022, a monkeypox National Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) was activated in response to the risk assessment conducted, which put Nigeria at high risk for a monkeypox outbreak. The essence of the activation was to improve the coordination of related preparedness/response activities across the country.

- There were 31 new suspected cases reported in Epi week 23, 2022 (6-12 Jun 2022) from 13 states -- Lagos (5), Katsina (4), Ondo (4), Bayelsa (4), Nasarawa (3), Ogun (3), Oyo (2), Akwa Ibom (1), Delta (1), Edo (1), Kaduna (1), Kano (1), and Imo (1).

- There were 4 new positive cases in Epi week 23, 2022 from 4 states -- Lagos (1), Delta (1), Oyo (1) and Nasarawa (1).

- From 1 Jan to 12 Jun 2022, there have been 141 suspected cases in total and 36 confirmed cases from 15 states -- Lagos (7), Adamawa (5), Delta (3), River (3), Cross River (2), FCT (2), Kano (2), Bayelsa (2), Edo (2), Imo (2), Plateau (2), Nasarawa (1), Niger (1), Oyo (1) and Ondo (1). One death was recorded in a 40-year-old man with co-morbidity that was receiving immunosuppressive drugs.

- Overall and from September 2017 to 12 Jun 2022, a total of 653 suspected cases have been reported from 33 states in the country.

- Of the reported cases, 262 (40.1%) have been confirmed in 23 states -- Rivers (55), Bayelsa (45), Lagos (37), Delta (32), Cross River (16), Edo (12), Imo (10), Akwa Ibom (7), Oyo (7), FCT (8), Plateau (5), Adamawa (5), Enugu (4), Abia (3), Nasarawa (3), Benue (2), Anambra (2), Ekiti (2), Kano (2), Niger (2), Ebonyi (1), Ogun (1) and Ondo (1).

- In addition, from September 2017 to 12 Jun 2022, a total of 9 deaths have been recorded (CFR = 3.4%) in 6 states -- Lagos (3), Edo (2), Imo (1), Cross River (1), FCT (1) and Rivers (1).

- Errata: The SITREP for Epiweek 22 wrongly captured the case count for Epiweek 22 as 10 instead of 11 (1 case from Niger state was missed), and the total for the year as of Epiweek 22 was captured as 31 cases instead of 32 cases.

Response activities [See URL for activities to date and next steps for]:
Coordination
Surveillance
Case management
IPC
POE
Laboratory
Risk communication

Challenges with monkeypox surveillance
1. Non-prioritisation of monkeypox as a disease of public health importance due to low-risk perception

Recommendations
1. Risk communication and social mobilization

Key activities
Coordination
1. The multi-agency MPX Emergency Operation Centre coordinates monkeypox activities at NCDC.

Epidemiology/Surveillance
1. Deployment of the one-health human and animal surveillance team to Adamawa state to support the State response

Next steps
1. Conduct active case searches in facilities and communities that have been reporting positive cases
2. Weekly follow-up calls/emails to the state's surveillance team and MPX treatment facilities.

Notes on this report
Data source: Information for this disease was case-based data retrieved from the National Monkeypox Emergency Operations Centre.

Case definitions
Suspected case: An acute illness with fever > 38.3 deg C [101 deg F], intense headache, lymphadenopathy, back pain, myalgia, and intense asthenia followed 1 to 3 days later by a progressively developing rash often beginning on the face (most dense) and then spreading elsewhere on the body, including soles of feet and palms of the hand.

Probable case: A case that meets the clinical case definition, is not laboratory-confirmed but has an epidemiological link to a confirmed case.

Confirmed case: A clinically compatible case that is laboratory confirmed.

Contact: Any person who has been in direct or indirect contact with a confirmed case since the onset of symptoms, i.e., contact with skin lesions, oral secretions, urine, faeces, vomitus, blood, sexual contact, sharing a common space (anyone who has been in close proximity with or without physical contact with a confirmed case).

Calculations
Case fatality rate (CFR) for this disease is reported for confirmed cases only.

The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that the African country of Ghana has joined the list of countries reporting monkeypox infection among humans in the African region.

On 8 Jun 2022, the country reported 5 confirmed cases detected out of 12 suspected cases sampled between 24 May and 8 Jun 2022. The cases were reported from the Eastern, Western, and Greater Accra regions.

According to a Crisis24 report [https://bit.ly/3mXRWRh], monkeypox does not naturally occur in Ghana; most cases are reported in West and Central Africa, primarily in the DRC, Nigeria, and Cameroon among individuals who report contact with animals which may harbor the disease.

Monkeypox is a disease caused by the monkeypox virus. It is a viral zoonotic disease, meaning that it can spread from animals to humans. It can also spread between people.

Symptoms of monkeypox typically include a fever, intense headache, muscle aches, back pain, low energy, swollen lymph nodes and a skin rash or lesions. The rash usually begins within 1 to 3 days of the start of a fever. Lesions can be flat or slightly raised, filled with clear or yellowish fluid, and can then crust, dry up and fall off. The number of lesions on one person can range from a few to several thousand. The rash tends to be concentrated on the face, palms of the hands and soles of the feet. They can also be found on the mouth, genitals and eyes.

Symptoms typically last between 2-4 weeks and go away on their own without treatment. If you think you have symptoms that could be monkeypox, seek advice from your health care provider. Let them know if you have had close contact with someone who has suspected or confirmed monkeypox.

[Cases occur sporadically throughout the year in Nigeria and across the country except to the far northeast. Individuals infected with monkeypox [MPX] virus have traveled to other countries with their infections. The above report in item 2 does not indicate which of the 2 clades of MPX virus is responsible for the cases. The reported case fatality rate of 3.4% is higher than the usual 1% for the West African clade but lower than the up to 10% for the Central African clade.

The report does not indicate if the reported cases are due to person-to-person transmission or to contact with infected wild mammals. Monkeys are not the reservoirs of the virus, despite the name that the virus has received. Studies of the prevalence of MPX virus in populations of rodent hosts are not mentioned in this or previous reports. The main reservoirs of MPX virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp, an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_. Halting the bushmeat trade and consumption of wild animals to halt MPX virus exposure will be culturally and economically difficult, so continued occurrence of cases can be expected. MPX virus has been shown to be transmitted between people in Africa, but not readily. - Mod.TY
