[With the continuing decline in the number of cases in the human
population of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease -- abbreviated
previously as vCJD or CJD (new var.) in ProMED-mail -- it has been
decided to broaden the scope of the occasional ProMED-mail updates to
include other prion-related diseases. Data on vCJD cases and other
forms of CJD: sporadic, iatrogenic, familial, and GSS
(Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease) are included also when they
have some relevance to the incidence and etiology of vCJD. - Mod.CP]

Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease statistics as of 4 Aug 2008
-------------------------------------------------------------
The number of suspect cases of vCJ referred to the CJD surveillance
unit in Edinburgh and the number of deaths of definite and probable
variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [abbreviated in ProMED-mail as CJD
(new var.) or vCJD], the form of the disease thought to be linked to
BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) remain unchanged since the
previous monthly report; i.e., the number of definite or probable
vCJD cases (dead and alive) remains 167.

This situation is consistent with the view that the vCJD outbreak in
the UK is in decline. The 1st cases were observed in 1995 and the
peak number of deaths was 28 in the year 2000, followed by 20 in
2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in 2003, 9 in 2004, 5 in 2005, 5 in 2006, 5 in
2007, and only one so far in 2008.

Totals for all types of CJD cases in the year 2008
--------------------------------------------------
As of 4 Aug 2008 in the UK, so far there have been 78 referrals, 44
deaths from sporadic CJD, 4 deaths from iatrogenic CJD, 3 from GSS,
one from familial CJD, and one from vCJD.

Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease statistics as of 30 Jun 2008
--------------------------------------------------------------
This document has not been updated for the month of July 2008. The
data are repeated here to allow comparison with the corresponding
data from the UK (above) and the USA (below). During the period 1992
to 2008 there were 23 cases of vCJD, all now deceased. They occurred
between 1996 and 2007: one case in 1996, one in 2000, one in 2001, 3
in 2002, none in 2003, 2 in 2004, 6 in 2005, 6 in 2006, 3 in 2007,
and none so far in 2008. There were 12 male and 11 female patients.

Their ages at time of death ranged from 19 to 58 years (mean 39); 6
of the patients resided in the Ile-de-France [Paris area] and 17 in
the provinces. All the cases were met-met homozygotes for codon 129
of the prion protein gene. No special risk factors were evident,
which distinguished these patients from those with other forms of CJD
(sporadic, genetic, iatrogenic). However one patient had visited the
UK at regular intervals.

Totals for all types of CJD cases in the year 2008
--------------------------------------------------
As of 30 Jun 2008 in France, so far in 2008 there have been 722
referrals, 26 deaths from sporadic CJD, one death from iatrogenic
CJD, 3 from familial CJD, none from GSS, and none from vCJD,

Cases examined - as of June 2008
--------------------------------
During the period 1997 to 2008, 2 cases of vCJD were reported, both
contracted overseas. The 1st case was recorded in 2004, disease
contracted in the UK, and the 2nd in 2006, disease contracted in Saudi Arabia.

Totals for all types of CJD cases in the year 2008
--------------------------------------------------
So far in 2008 there have been 191 referrals, 95 cases of prion
disease, 44 cases of sporadic CJD, 10 cases of familial CJD, no cases
of atrogenic CJD and no cases of vCJD.

Overall during the period 1997 to 2008, there have been 2877
referrals, 1638 cases of prion disease, 1358 cases of sporadic CJD,
239 cases of familial CJD, 4 cases of iatrogenic CJD and no
indigenous cases of vCJD.

[It is unclear whether the recently characterised 'novel' form of CJD
described in the following reports is included in these data. - Mod.CP]

[4] 'Novel' CJD

'New CJD type' discovered in US
-------------------------------
A new form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) may have been uncovered
in a handful of patients in the US. So far, 10 people have died from
a fast-advancing form of fatal dementia called PSPr, according to a
report in New Scientist [see (4) below]. Patients develop the
trademark brain damage associated with CJD -- the type not linked to
BSE -- but scientists believe there may be a genetic cause [familial CJD].

Experts in the UK are now checking records to see if any cases have
happened across the Atlantic. There are between 50 and 100 new cases
of so-called sporadic CJD diagnosed in the UK every year. Unlike
"variant CJD," the human form of BSE in cows contracted by eating
contaminated brain tissue in the 1980s and 1990s, the cause of most
cases of sporadic CJD is unknown.

The new cases were referred to CJD surveillance units in the US
because they were a suspiciously fast-advancing form of dementia with
additional symptoms such as the loss of the ability to speak and
move, even though traditional tests that normally help diagnose CJD
proved negative. Post-mortems on those who died revealed the familiar
"spongy" brain tissue, covered with tiny holes. These are thought to
be caused by the accumulation of "prions," a misshapen version of a
normal brain protein.

Dr. Pierluigi Gambetti, director of the US National Prion Disease
Pathology Surveillance Center, in Ohio, said that he believed the
newly discovered type had probably "been around for years,
unnoticed." He suggested one interesting common factor was that the
patients came from families with a history of dementia, suggesting a
genetic cause, but did not carry the gene traditionally associated
with a small number of sporadic CJD cases.

Dr. Mark Head, from the UK's National CJD Surveillance Unit, in
Edinburgh, said the finding had prompted scientists to start
reviewing cases of sporadic CJD in this country to see if there were
any of the newly discovered version. He said: "What is interesting
about this is that it may mean there are other genes out there
waiting to be found which are associated with prion disease, and
looking at these patients in the US could help find them.

[5] 'Novel' CJD

New CJD-like disease kills 10 people
------------------------------------
A new form of fatal dementia has been discovered in 16 Americans, 10
of whom have already died of the condition. It resembles
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease -- with patients gradually losing their
ability to think, speak and move -- but has features that make it
distinct from known forms of CJD.

No one yet knows how the disease originates, or under what conditions
it might spread. Nor is it clear how many people have the condition.
"I believe the disease has been around for many years, unnoticed,"
says Pierluigi Gambetti, director of the US National Prion Disease
Pathology Surveillance Center at Case Western Reserve University in
Cleveland, Ohio. Cases may previously have been mistaken for other
forms of dementia.

Since Gambetti's team wrote a paper describing an initial 11 cases
referred to his centre between 2002 and 2006 (Annals of Neurology,
vol 63, p 697), another 5 have come to light. "So it is possible that
it could be just the tip of the iceberg," Gambetti says.

As in other spongiform encephalopathies, such as CJD and mad cow
disease (BSE), the brain tissue of victims is full of tiny holes.
This damage is thought to be caused by the accumulation of prions,
misfolded versions of a brain protein called PrP that can convert
normal PrP molecules into their own misshapen form.

Some features of the new disease are different, however. All known
disease-causing prions resist degradation by proteases -- enzymes
which digest the normal form of PrP. But prions from patients with
the new disease are broken down by the enzymes.

Some very rare forms of CJD run in families and are caused by
mutations in the gene for PrP. A total of 6 of the cases described in
Gambetti's paper were from families with a history of dementia,
suggesting a genetic cause. However, these people had no mutations in
their PrP genes. "Maybe there are other genes that have an influence
on the disease," suggests James Ironside of the UK's National CJD
Surveillance Unit in Edinburgh.

Most forms of CJD develop spontaneously, for unknown reasons, but can
be spread if someone is exposed to brain material from people with
CJD, for instance, by neurosurgery using inadequately sterilised instruments.

One variant of CJD has been linked to the consumption of contaminated
meat from cattle with mad cow disease. If the new condition is
similarly caused by something in the victims' diet, or another
environmental cause, new measures might be needed to protect public
health. Gambetti is now conducting experiments in mice to see how the
disease is transmitted. He suspects that there is no cause for alarm.
"I believe the disease occurs naturally, and is not due to
environmental causes, he says.

[In submitting this report, Terry S. Singeltary Sr. draws attention
to the steady increase in the "type unknown" category, which,
according to their definition, comprises cases in which vCJD could be
excluded. The total of 26 cases for the current year (2007) is
disturbing, possibly symptomatic of the circulation of novel agents.
Characterization of these agents should be given a high priority. - Mod.CP]

[6] Prions and sewage treatment

Prions Are Not Degraded By Conventional Sewage Treatment Processes
------------------------------------------------------------------
Scientists in Wisconsin are reporting that typical wastewater
treatment processes do not degrade prions. Prions, rogue proteins
that cause incurable brain infections such as Mad Cow Disease and its
human equivalent, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, are difficult to
inactivate, resisting extreme heat, chemical disinfectants, and
irradiation. Until now, scientists did not know whether prions
entering sewers and septic tanks from slaughterhouses, meatpacking
facilities, or private game dressing, could survive and pass through
conventional sewage treatment plants.

Joel Pedersen and colleagues used laboratory experiments with
simulated wastewater treatment to show that prions can be recovered
from wastewater sludge after 20 days, remaining in the "biosolids," a
byproduct of sewage treatment sometimes used to fertilize farm
fields. Although emphasizing that prions have never been reported in
wastewater treatment plant water or biosolids, the researchers note
that existing tests are not sufficiently sensitive to detect the
extremely low levels of prions possible in those materials.
