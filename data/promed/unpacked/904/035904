As a people pathologist, I'm very curious about the nature of the sores
that Pfiesteria causes on fish and possibly on humans. I understand that
in it's dinoflagellate form it secretes the toxins that kill the fish, but
at some point it changes to an ameboid form that causes the sores.
I'd like to know whether that's true or not, but am more curious about
whether either form is confined to the skin or might be invasive. Could
one of the little beasties invade the blood stream and eat up some internal
organs? The liver, maybe?
If there are fish pathologists around, I'd very much appreciate it if you
could steer me in that direction somehow.

Pfiesteria piscicida secretes potent toxin which can cause severe damage
(epithelial sloughing) to the skin of fish. The amount of toxin(s)
produced depend upon the life stage and probably other currently unknown
ecological factors. We do not yet know if different life stages secrete
different types of toxins although certain stages (eg., vegetative and
amoeboid stages) appear to be more potent toxin producers than others.
Whether fish exposed to Pfiesteria toxin will die acutely or instead suffer
from chronic damage (eg., skin ulcers) depends upon the dosage of toxin and
probably the type of toxin released since there appears to be at least 2
toxins produced.
Whether Pfiesteria can can skin damage to humans or other mammals is not
clear, but we will be undertaking studies shortly to examine this question.
It should be noted that fish skin is very different physiologically from
mammalian skin. Mammalian skin has a thick layer of dead cells on the
surface while fish skin is completely alive, making it more like a mucosal
surface.
There is no evidence whatsoever and it is highly unlikely that Pfiesteria
can invade internal organs. This speculation grew out of the observation
that Pfiesteria can phagocytize fish and human bloods cells in vitro.
However, since this organism survives by ingesting small prey (i.e., cells)
this is not a surprising finding, since the blood cells would just be
another food item. Pfiesteria has never been observed in the internal
organs of fish, nor has it even been seen attached to the surface of a fish.
