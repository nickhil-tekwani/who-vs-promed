[_Francisella tularensis subsp. tularensis_ (Type A) is associated with lagomorphs (rabbits and hares). Wild rodents are also frequently infected, and occurrence of human cases is usually linked to these host species. _F. tularensis_ is transmitted primarily by ticks and biting flies, and is highly virulent for humans and domestic rabbits.

Tularemia is largely confined to the Northern Hemisphere and is not normally found in the tropics or the Southern Hemisphere. However, there is a known natural focus of tularemia in Central Europe, which is considered an endemic area. The tick implicated there is _Dermacentor reticulatus_.

In addition to vector transmission, tularemia may be spread contact with infected animals or environmental fomites by inhalation, or by ingestion of the poorly cooked flesh of infected animals or contaminated water. - Mod.PMB
