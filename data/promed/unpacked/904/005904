From: Paul Levett <levett@sunbeach.net>

There have been many point-source outbreaks of leptospirosis in the USA
over the years. Many reports suggest that the infections occurred after
periods of drought and hot weather. This applies to ponds as well as
running-water outbreaks. This would appear to be the case also in the
Illinois episode.
Obviously the hot weather raises the water temperature and allows better
survival/growth of pathogenic leptospires, but no-one has yet explained the
significance of reduced rainfall.
Does anybody have any suggestions?
