With Respect to the posting by James Krahel and the relevance of the toxin
mycolactone to other mycobacterial diseases such as TB and Leprosy.
We did not mean to imply that a molecule with the same activities as
mycolactone might be present in _M. leprae_, but simply that molecules of
the same chemical class..i.e., polylketide-derived macrolides may be
present. This class of compounds includes immunosupressants, cytostatins
and cell biological agents which have a profound effect on intracellular
trafficking pathways. These include brefeldin and cytochalasin.
Intracellular mycobacteria seem to alter intracellular pathways and are
found in vacuoles arrested in their progress through the endosomal
pathway..i.e., mycobacterial vacuoles do not fuse with lysosomes.
Macrolides are a class of compounds with activities which suggest they
could play a role in this phenotype.
With regards to TB we would hypothesize three possible phenotypes that
would be consistent with polyketide activities:
1) cellular damage in active disease; Barry Bloom's work with mice
suggests that damage by _M. tuberculosis_ is not simply due to the immune
response.
2) immunosuppression
3) avoidance of phago-lysosomal fusion
