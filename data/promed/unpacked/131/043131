A retrospective study carried out in 2005 has
shown that Switzerland has been affected by the
lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) outbreaks that
have occurred in several western European
countries. 11 cases have been diagnosed to date.
The 1st diagnosed case of LGV in Switzerland was
identified by a private laboratory in Jun 2005,
which notified the health authorities (1, 2). The
patient was a gay man in Geneva who presented
with anorectal syndrome. Subtyping by molecular
techniques (PCR-RFLP) confirmed an infection with
_Chlamydia trachomatis_ serovar L2.

Heightened awareness of LGV infections in Europe
(3, 4) led a Swiss physician, who had previously
taken rectal swabs found to be positive for _C.
trachomatis_ from gay male patients, to initiate
a retrospective analysis of rectal swabs taken
between Jan 1999 and May 2005. The 37 specimens
were collected by private general physicians from
35 men who had sex with men (MSM) aged between 25
and 56 years, and were tested for _C.
trachomatis_ by PCR at a laboratory in Zurich (5).

Subtyping was done by amplification of the omp1
(momp) gene and partial sequencing of the product
(6). The serotype L2 was confirmed in 12
specimens, collected from 10 patients. Non-LGV
serotypes were identified in the remaining 25
swabs (Table - [see original URL above for table
- Mod.LL]).

The physicians were asked to provide further
clinical information about the patients, based on
the patients' notes. Proctitis, often described
as hemorrhagic or purulent, was the most common
clinical manifestation observed in the LGV
patients (8 of 10). The other 2 patients with LGV
presented with anal discharge. Lymphadenopathy
was not reported in any of the cases.

Clinical manifestations were also reported for 16
of the 25 patients infected with a non-L2
serotype. Most common was proctitis (in 6
patients) and anal discharge (in 5 patients).
Other clinical manifestations in this group were
proctalgia, proctodynia, peri-anal ulceration and
rectal gonorrhoea. One of the 10 LGV patients had
a _Neisseria gonorrhoea_ co-infection, 7 had HIV
co-infection, and 1 had early syphilis.

6 of the 10 LGV patients in the retrospective
study had reported the likely place of infection:
Thailand (2003), and 5 western European cities,
London, Amsterdam, Belgium (all 2003), Berlin and
Zurich (both 2005).

Although all 10 patients in the retrospective
study were from Zurich and Lucerne, and 6 of them
presented in 2003, there is no evidence that they
were directly linked.

Notification of _C. trachomatis_ infections is
mandatory in Switzerland, but subtype information
is not generally available, and cases of LGV,
caused by one of the serotypes L1, L2 or L3, are
not mandatorily notifiable as such. Because the
necessary diagnostic laboratory techniques have
not been available until recently, it is likely
that the cases identified so far represent only a
small fraction of the cases that have actually
occurred. This hypothesis is supported by the
recent finding that the same LGV strain (L2b)
that was later identified at many places in
Europe had been present in San Francisco in the
early 1980s (7).

The LGV epidemic in MSM is a serious public
health concern. Like other ulcerative venereal
diseases, LGV enhances the susceptibility to, and
facilitates the transmission of HIV and other
sexually transmitted infections (8). The fact
that many patients with LGV were reportedly
HIV-positive points to an increase of risky
sexual practices among MSM, possibly related in
part to wrong assumptions regarding risk
management (9-11).

Measures have been taken to increase awareness
among general physicians and in the gay community
as well, including publications in the bulletin
of the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health,
reaching all private practitioners in
Switzerland, with recommendations on treatment
and follow-up, and information material targeted
at MSM that can be distributed by national and
local NGOs working in HIV/AIDS prevention.

[The LGV organism gains entrance through skin
breaks or abrasions, or crosses the epithelial
cells of mucous membranes. Traveling via the
lymphatics, it multiplies within mononuclear
phagocytes in the regional lymph nodes.
Transmission is predominantly sexual. However,
transmission by fomites, nonsexual personal
contact, or laboratory accidents has been
documented. The creation of aerosols has been
associated with infection in combination with
pulmonary symptoms.

The disease occurs in 3 stages. The majority of
infections in the primary and secondary stages
may go undetected. The primary stage is marked by
the formation of a painless herpetiform
ulceration at the site of inoculation. The
secondary stage classically is described as the
inguinal syndrome, and it is characterized by
painful inguinal lymphadenitis and associated
constitutional symptoms:

Tender inguinal lymphadenopathy, usually
unilateral, is the most common clinical
manifestation.

Heterosexual men are affected most often in the
inguinal lymph nodes. Homosexual men and women
who are receptive to anal sex may develop
perirectal and pelvic lymph node involvement. In
women, these nodes may be involved as a result of
lymphatic spread from the cervix and posterior
vaginal wall.

Suppurative granulomatous lymphadenitis and
perilymphadenitis occur over time with matting of
the nodes. Frequently, these nodes coalesce to
form stellate abscesses. Histologically, these
abscesses are nearly diagnostic, but they may be
similar to those seen in other infections,
including cat scratch fever and mycobacterial
granulomatous infections.

The tertiary stage of LGV occurs years after the
initial infection. In this stage, an
anogenitorectal syndrome may occur, with
resultant rectal stricture or elephantiasis of
the genitalia. This syndrome is found
predominantly in women and homosexual men,
because of the location of the involved
lymphatics. This late stage is characterized by
proctocolitis, which is caused by hyperplasia of
intestinal and perirectal lymphatic tissue. This
inflammation forms perirectal abscesses,
ischiorectal abscesses, rectovaginal fistulas,
anal fistulas, and rectal stricture. In very
late stages, fibrosis and granulomas are
characteristic. Chlamydial organisms are scarce
at this stage. - Mod.LL]
