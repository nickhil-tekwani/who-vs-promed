Health officials warned of a possible anthrax epidemic after more than
40 cases of infections related to the disease were reported in 2
different places in northern Luzon in the past few weeks. In Bangued,
Abra, according to the town officials, 38 people were hospitalized and
confined since 8 May 2010 after being infected with anthrax. According
to reports, residents acquired the virus [sic] after eating 2 infected
carabaos in the town of Villaviciosa.

No deaths were reported due to timely aid given to the infected
individuals by health sectors.

However, provincial veterinarian Diosdado Taverner said the
Villaviciosa cases were isolated, and the spread of the [pathogen] was
in control.

Taverner also led a group of officials from the Department of Health
to investigate further the cases. Taverner warned the public from
eating livestock from the area at the moment, because of the high risk
of acquiring the virus from local animals. To stop spread of the
disease, the provincial officials started vaccinating livestock in the
area.

Head of the Animal Services of the Livestock division of the
Department of Agriculture Dr. Arlene Sagayo visited the area and
further investigated the condition of the livestock in Bangued to help
prevent possible outbreaks in the area.

In the northern part of Ilocos, another suspected case of anthrax was
reported after livestock, including carabaos and pigs, started dying
in the area. However, officials have yet to confirm the cause of death
but still put the possibility of anthrax as top priority in their
investigation.

The Center for Health Development in the Cordillera warned the people
to avoid eating local livestock until further proof of the virus is
studied well.

Meanwhile, Dr. Amelita Pangilinan of the regional DOH based in Baguio
said the Abra cases were "suspected" as anthrax from symptoms
exhibited by the victims. Pangilinan said if the animal is already
dead, it should not be eaten, because the animal might have had an
illness before it died.

Anthrax is caused by _Bacillus anthacis_ bacteria found in animals
like carabaos and cows. It can be transmitted through the eating of
meat. It is an airborne disease, and even going near or holding the
infected animal may cause the infection. It can also kill when not
immediately prevented and cured.

[Much of this is a repeat of what we have read before, though the
level of confirmation seems to have slipped to "suspected." Also, a
2nd area, northern Ilocos, is now under investigation, and this series
involves pigs as well as carabaos. As wandering domestic pigs will
scavenge dead animals, this is rather to be expected. In many parts of
the world, pigs are used at the village level as trash collectors,
eating any garbage that they can access.

OIE has 36 449 carabaos in Abra and 23 336 in Ilocos Norte.
