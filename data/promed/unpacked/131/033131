Although towards the end of the press report there is indeed some confusion,
to be fair to the authors they do make the distinction by saying early on
'However, the newly identified form of beef-related (sic) [nvCJD can
theoretically pass from person to person and could be more infectious than
"classic" CJD. '
The magnitude of the risk is indeed dependent on how many cases of nvCJD the
future may hold, which at present nobody can forecast. However, the _hazard_
that could potentially give rise to a risk, is based, not on belief of
number of nvCJD cases, but on considerations set out in the SEAC report from
its meeting on 26 October 1997.

SPONGIFORM ENCEPHALOPATHY COMMITTEE - ADVICE TO MINISTERS: HUMAN BLOOD AND
BLOOD PRODUCTS
"The Committee have recently concluded that the transmissible agent of nvCJD
is indistinguishable from that of BSE but distinctly different from any of
the forms of classical CJD. Recent research (some unpublished) suggests that
the pathogenesis of nvCJD differs from that of classical CJD and the former
may have more involvement of lymphoreticular tissues possibly involving
circulating lymphocytes.
"Therefore it is logical to seek to minimise any risk from blood or blood
products by reducing the number of lymphocytes present. SEAC recommends that
the Government should consider a precautionary policy of extending the use
of leuco-depleted blood and blood products as far as is practicable. It will
be for the National Blood Authority to devise a strategy to implement such a
policy. It will take time to achieve full implementation and SEAC recommends
that planning begins soon while the risk assessments suggested below are
carried out.
"It is not possible at present to estimate accurately the risk of
transmitting nvCJD by blood transfusion. The magnitude of the risk will
depend, inter alia, on the number of blood donors who are incubating nvCJD
and this is not known. However, SEAC recommends that risk assessments,
making assumptions of various possible incidences of nvCJD, be carried out
to inform decisions on any measures which may be necessary to protect
recipients. "

This dovetails with work by Adriano Aguzzi's group at Zurich [Nature 390,
687-690, 18/25, December 1997, 687, "A crucial role for B cells in
neuroinvasive scrapie" They reported a series of experiments on mice
stripped of their immune systems, which demonstrated how the agent needed
the immune system to pass from the gut to the brain. This work pointed to
the possible "bridge" from gut to brain: first the agent passes to the lymph
system, to follicular dendritic cells. From there it may pass to white blood
cells, notably lymphocytes, and then to the peripheral nervous system and
thence to the brain. This work was unpublished at the time of the SEAC
report, and is probably the "unpublished recent research" to which the SEAC
report referred.
