Headlines
Summary of newly-reported viruses this week:
- Afghanistan:
1 new case of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) reported in Kandahar province.
2 new WPV1 positive environmental samples reported, 1 collected from Kandahar province, and 1 from Nangarhar province.

Afghanistan
- 1 new case of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) was officially reported this week, from Shawalikot district, Kandahar province. Onset of this latest case was [3 Dec 2017]. The total number of officially reported WPV1 cases in Afghanistan in 2017 is now 13.
- 2 new WPV1 positive environmental samples were reported this week, one collected from Kandahar district, Kandahar province on [6 Dec 2017], and one from Behsud district, Nangarhar province, on [26 Nov 2017].
- A vaccination campaign using bOPV is scheduled to take place later this month [January 2018], targeting over 5 million children.

Pakistan
- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week.
- The total number of officially reported WPV1 cases in Pakistan in 2017 remains 8.
- A vaccination campaign using bOPV is scheduled to take place later this month [January 2018], targeting over 36 million children.

Nigeria
- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [21 Aug 2016] in Monguno Local Government Area, Borno.
- Nigeria continues to implement an emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) strains affecting the country (last detected in 2016).
- The next round of sub-national immunization days is planned for late [January 2018].
- Detection of polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission. As part of the emergency response, subnational surveillance continues to be strengthened.

Lake Chad Basin
- The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) (Borno state, Nigeria in 2016) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) (Borno and Sokoto states in 2016) continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin.
- Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.
- These activities include efforts to vaccinate children at markets, in internally displaced persons camps, and at international borders.
- Phase 3 of outbreak response is going ahead in [January 2018], taking into account many of the recommendations made at the recent Outbreak Response Assessment and Technical Advisory Group meetings. The objective is to maintain and improve the multi-national, regional outbreak response across the Lake Chad region.

Central Africa
- No new cases of type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) were reported this week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The total number of officially reported cVDPV2 cases in the DRC in 2017 remains 12.
- The most recent cVDPV2 case (by date of onset) was reported in Ankoro district, Tanganika province, with onset on [17 Nov 2017].
- Outbreak response continues to take place across the country, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols.
- Surveillance and immunization activities continue to be strengthened in neighbouring countries.

Middle East
- No new cases of cVDPV2 were reported this week. The most recent case (by date of onset) was reported in Boukamal district, with onset on [21 Sep 2017].
- The total number of officially reported cVDPV2 cases in Syria in 2017 remains 74.
- Planning continues for the 2nd phase of the outbreak response. GPEI continues to assist the Syrian Ministry of Health in the planning process.
- The 2nd phase of the outbreak response will use mOPV2 and IPV in 2 additional immunization rounds, through house-to-house and fixed vaccination center strategies.

Officially reported cVDPV cases as of 2 Jan 2018
Total global cases in 2017: 86 (compared with 3 for the same period in 2016)

[It is not surprising to have a continued reporting of cases into the New Year (2018) that had onset last year (2017) as the time lag from date of onset of illness to date of laboratory confirmation can be several weeks to a few months. Looking at the above information, there is still reason for optimism in the continued efforts of the polio eradication effort, with the 2017 total number of WPV1 attributed cases at the lowest ever reported - 27 cases.

Unfortunately the same cannot be said for cases attributable to cVDPV2, with a major outbreak in Syria (74 cases) and outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (12 cases involving 2 outbreak locations).

All areas with continued polio activity (both WPV1 and cVDPV) are areas with civil unrest that has led to significant pockets of unvaccinated individuals facilitating the circulation of the polioviruses in the population. We do not have the dates of the positive environmental samples in Afghanistan but it is highly suggestive there is continued circulation of the WPV1 in both Kandahar province and Nangarhar province.
