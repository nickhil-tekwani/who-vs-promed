In ProMED post 20091018.3582 Crimean-Congo hem. fever - Iran (04):
abattoir workers, official veterinarian Dr Hamid Ebrahimzadeh wrote:

"Iran has more than 50 autonomous abattoirs comprising modern meat
processing facilities for halal slaughter, emergency slaughter,
refrigeration, condemned meat disposal, hide and skin storage, offal
disposal, edible fat collection, meat trimming rooms, changing rooms,
and veterinary offices. ... I wish to point out that the CCHF virus,
and nairoviruses in general, are sensitive to pH changes.
Consequently, when rigor mortis ensues (pH about 5.8), the carcasses
of cattle in particular will be free of virus infectivity. Thus, the
lapse of time between slaughter and consumption ensures that the meat
will be free of infectivity and is an important factor in risk
management."

[A study by Dr Sadegh Chinikar (in Ergonul O & Whitehouse CA (eds)
2007 Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever: A Global Perspective, OUP NY)
found that only 16/233 cases of CCHF in Iran were in slaughterhouse
workers, compared with 38 in butchers, raising the question as to why
butchers were at higher risk when presumably they would be receiving
meat from the slaughterhouse with low pH, which would therefore be
non-infectious. ProMED asked for further details, and Dr Chinikar
replied as follows]

In reply to your question about the high number of butchers affected
by CCHF, if butchers used only correctly slaughtered commercial
livestock, they would be at lesser risk of CCHF infection than
slaughterhouse workers. But when we check their history in the rural
areas, some butchers sacrifice livestock themselves in addition to
using commercially slaughtered livestock; this issue should not be
forgotten. Those butchers would certainly increase their CCHF
infection risk this way. The virus can persist in livestock liver for
about 40 days because the pH in the liver does not drop at the same
rate as in muscle, and some people eat uncooked liver.
