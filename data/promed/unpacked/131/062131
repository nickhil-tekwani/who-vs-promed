The Ministry of Agriculture says American foul brood disease has been
reported at 33 apiaries in St Thomas [one of the parishes of Surrey County
- in the east of the island. - Mod.SH]. The disease, which affects honey
bees, is caused by _Bacillus larvae_, a spore foaming organism [bacterium -
Mod.TG] possessing highly persistent characteristics.

The ministry says it has quarantined the affected apiaries and has sent a
team of scientists to further inspect other apiaries in the parish. This is
with a view to identify and destroy all hives, wooden structures and
production equipment that are confirmed or suspected to be carriers of the
spores. The Research and Development Unit says it has also intensified its
efforts to train bee keepers in the prevention, detection, treatment and
eradication of the disease, which is said to be eliminated through the
destruction of whole colonies and hives by burning.

The presence of foul brood disease can be identified by the emergence of
holes in some of the affected cells, scattered brood patterns similar in
appearance to black pepper, and an oily appearance of the brood. Foul brood
disease is not uncommon in Jamaica. The 1st case was reported in 1918;
however, the disease was detected in St Thomas and St Elizabeth in 1989.

[American foul brood (AFB), caused by the spore-forming bacterium _Bacillus
larvae_, is the most widespread and destructive of the bee brood diseases.
Bee larvae up to 3 days old become infected by ingesting spores that are
present in their food. Spores germinate in the gut of the larva, and the
vegetative form begins to grow, taking its nourishment from the larva.
Spores will not germinate in larvae over 3 days old. Bacterial growth
causes the eventual death of the larva. The vegetative form of the
bacterium will die but not before it produces many millions of spores. Each
dead larva may contain as many as 100 million spores.

Disease spreads rapidly throughout the hive as the bees, attempting to
remove the spore-laden dead larvae, contaminate brood food. Nectar stored
in contaminated cells will contain spores, and soon the brood chamber
becomes filled with contaminated honey. As this honey is moved up into the
supers, the entire hive becomes contaminated with spores. When the colony
becomes weak from AFB infection, robber bees may enter and take
contaminated honey back to their hives, thereby spreading the disease to
other colonies and apiaries. Beekeepers also may spread disease by moving
equipment (frames or supers) from contaminated hives to healthy ones.

American foul brood spores are extremely resistant to desiccation and can
remain viable for more than 40 years in honey and beekeeping equipment.
Therefore, honey from an unknown source should never be used as bee feed,
and used beekeeping equipment should be assumed contaminated unless known
to be otherwise.

Terramycin (oxytetracycline) is the only drug approved for use against AFB.
When present in the food given to susceptible bee larvae, this antibiotic
is effective in preventing germination of AFB spores. The bees are then
able to develop and mature normally. Terramycin will not kill the spores
and is not a means for sterilizing either the bees or the equipment. If a
colony contains AFB spores and is maintained in a healthy condition through
treatment with terramycin, the disease will recur when the drug treatment
is discontinued.

It is a good practice to treat with terramycin (TM) on a preventative
basis. The terramycin should be mixed with powdered sugar in a ratio which
depends on the strength of the drug. Treatment of a beehive consists of
sprinkling 2 tablespoons of the TM and sugar mixture over the tops of the
brood frames. Preventative treatment should consist of 2 treatments about
one week apart in the spring, at least 4 weeks before putting on surplus
honey supers and another one or 2 treatments in the fall after taking off
the honey supers.

To treat a diseased colony, apply 3 to 4 treatments of the TM-sugar mixture
at about weekly intervals. If these treatments must be done during the
summer with the honey supers on, they should be left on the colony over the
winter for bee feed, because the terramycin will get into the honey supers
and, therefore, contaminate the honey. Diseased colonies that do not
respond to 3 or 4 treatments of terramycin should be destroyed.

Diseased colonies that must be destroyed can be killed with resmethrin
insecticide that comes in an aerosol can and is available from bee supply
dealers. Bees should be killed at a time when there is no flight. The
frames and combs should be burned in a pit and the ashes covered. The heavy
woodenware (supers, tops and bottoms, etc) may be sterilized by scraping
them clean (the scrapings should be burned) and scorching the inside
surfaces. The scorching can be done with a propane torch; particular
attention must be paid to cracks and corners. If large quantities of supers
are to be scorched, they may be stacked and painted inside with kerosene
and lit. Keep a cover handy to extinguish the flames when the wood is
sufficiently scorched. To sterilize large quantities of equipment, it might
be worthwhile to set up a barrel with a boiling lye solution of 1 lb. of
lye to 10 gallons of water. The woodenware should be immersed in the
solution and boiled 5 to 10 minutes or until clean.

Frames may also be sterilized in this manner. Lye is a very caustic
solution; use extreme care in this process.

Most beekeepers who have had any experience with AFB in their hives will
agree that the best approach is to treat with terramycin on a preventative
basis and inspect colonies regularly. Colonies that show signs of AFB
should be destroyed and the equipment sterilized.

No method of treatment for AFB is completely effective for permanent
control. Beekeepers should inspect their colonies regularly and always be
alert for possible recurrence.
