Unknown Disease Causes Fear in Turkey
----------------------------------------
An unknown disease found in Turkish northern province of Tokat has caused
fear in the region, reported the Turkish Daily News on Wednesday.
In the province, 4 people have died of the mysterious disease and 4 other
people are receiving treatment in Cumhuriyet University Research Hospital,
said Tokat Governor Mehmet Gundogdu. "Pesticide traces were found in the
examination of one patient," he said, adding, however, viral infections and
vein disease are also possible. So far, the [cause of the] disease could not
be confirmed.
The governor has sent a warning letter to neighboring Samsun, Ordu, Amasya,
Gorun, Yozgat and Sivas governorships, relating to the unknown disease in
Tokat last month. He said that it was important to give information to the
neighboring provinces, including the symptoms of the disease.
