Horse owners in the north have gone into lock-down in a bid to prevent the spread of a highly contagious equine disease.

An outbreak of strangles has been reported at controversial pony trekking firm Highlands Unbridled, which moved its headquarters from Sutherland to Ross-shire [Scotland] last year [2015].

A neighbouring yard has also reported that a number of its horses are thought to have caught the infection.

Two north horse shows have now been postponed and Lairg Crofters' Show, which is set to take place tomorrow [Sat 27 Aug 2016; see http://www.visitsutherland.org/whats-on/event/lairg-crofters-show/], has also called off its horse section.

Highland Council and other public agencies have become involved including the Animal and Plant Health Agency, Scottish SPCA and the British Horse Society (BHS).

Worried horse owners have taken to the internet in droves to voice their concern.

Ruaridh Ormiston of Newtonmore Riding Centre is urging people to campaign to make strangles a notifiable and controlled disease.

Strangles is a bacterial infection of the upper respiratory tract of horses and its name is derived from the ability of the disease to essentially "strangle" a horse. It is fatal in one per cent of cases.

It is one of the most common equine respiratory infections in the world and is spread by both direct contact between horses and indirect contact via clothing, hands, shared drinking water and feet or tack and equipment.

It is understood vets were called in to Highlands Unbridled's yard at Fendom, Tain, on the weekend of 12-13 Aug [2016] when some horses showed signs of illness.

Strangles was subsequently confirmed and the yard was shut with closed notices placed on signboards.

The Northern Times has been told that, as of this week, 8 of Highlands Unbridled's 40 horses have been infected.

The company specialises in long distance trekking. It is understood treks have taken place since the disease was confirmed, although the horses involved are not thought to have been stabled at the Fendom yard.

A spokeswoman for a local veterinary practice said: "We can confirm there is a premises north of Inverness with cases of strangles (bacterial infection of the upper respiratory tract in horses caused by _Streptococcus equi equi_)."

She added: "Strangles is an endemic disease which is constantly circulating within the horse population of the United Kingdom and there are sporadic cases in the Highlands."

Following the outbreak at Highlands Unbridled, owners of a neighbouring private yard, North Wilds, said 3 of their horses were also suspected to be affected.

Sandra Miller, who runs the yard with partner Lloyd Roberts said a Shetland, Highland mare and Clydesdale had come down with the disease.

Ms Miller said: "Any yard can have strangles, it is how you deal with it that is the issue."

Organisers of Lairg Crofters' Show made it known last week that it had been decided not to go ahead with the traditional horse show.

And Richard Pumphrey, owner of Hollingswells Riding Centre, Edderton, who was set to have a riding show in Tain last Sunday, decided to postpone it.

Also postponed was the fundraising Sutherland Riding Show, held annually at Doll, Brora.

Highland Council said it was aware of the outbreak at Highlands Unbridled and has also been informed of other suspected cases in the north.

A spokesperson said: "The council is liaising with Highlands Unbridled to ensure appropriate disease control and biosecurity steps are being taken.

"The licensed premises in Tain (Highlands Unbridled) have closed their yard and the manager is implementing the BHS code on strangles as advised by their vet. Officers are liaising with the business to ensure that appropriate controls are being taken regarding their trail riding activities."

The spokesperson added: "Our officers are in contact with various organisations including the government's Animal and Plant Health Agency, Scottish SPCA, British Horse Society and veterinary practices to ensure that all necessary procedures are being undertaken to contain the disease.

"Horse yard operators are also recommended to consider the premium assured strangles scheme initiative launched by SAC Consulting Veterinary Services."

Highlands Unbridled moved its headquarters from Strathsteven, Brora, to Fendom in September last year after Highland Council threatened to shut down the centre for failing to comply with planning legislation. The firm has also faced criticism over health and welfare issues as well as its use of public paths and byways for treks.

Its riding licence is up for renewal in December [2016].

Highland Council said: "As with any licensed riding establishment, the council will take appropriate action if they (Highlands Unbridled) are not in compliance with their licence conditions.

"It should be noted, however, that the council do not have powers to suspend a licence under the current riding establishments acts. The council is seeking improvements to the legislation."
