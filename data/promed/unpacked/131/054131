E. COLI O157:H7 INFECTIONS, HUMAN - USA (OREGON): CORRECTION

E. coli O157:H7 infections, human - USA (Oregon) 980404084323

From: S. Jue <rjue@otc.isu.edu>

The table in the Results section of SPORADIC CASES OF HEMORRHAGIC
ESCHERICHIOSIS from Oregon Health Division's CD Summary was not received
correctly. For each "Year of Onset" (the tables X-axis) the number of "O157
infections" were the Y-axis increments from 0 to 250! The actual cases
from the table by year are as follows- year [number of cases: 1991 [110,
1992 [150, 1993 [250, 1994 [100, 1995 [95, 1996 [100, 1997 [95.

The number of cases is estimated from the table "O157 Infections by Year,
Oregon, 1991-97." As posted, indeed, Oregon appeared to have an interesting
case trend.

Thanks for the correction. The original posting was cross-posted from
FSNET, and posted exactly as received from the contributor. Our moderator
(MHJ) had noted below the table in question that the data seemed to be
lacking a case number for 1997. We are pleased to have this cleared up. -
