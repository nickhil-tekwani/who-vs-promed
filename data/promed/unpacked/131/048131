First West Nile Virus Death in Alabama; Fifth in USA
----------------------------------------------------
A 44-year-old man has become the first person in Alabama to die from West
Nile virus infection, state health officials said on Fri 16 Nov 2001. The
man, who was not identified, died on 30 Oct 2001 after becoming infected in
late August, state veterinarian Bill Johnston said.
The man is the fifth person in the nation to die from the mosquito-borne
virus this year, following a 70-year-old man in Massachusetts, a 45-year-old
man in New Jersey, a 71-year-old woman in Georgia and a Connecticut woman in
her 90s.
The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention didn't confirm the
Alabama case until Thu 15 Nov 2001 because of a backlog caused by the
anthrax investigation, Johnston said.
West Nile virus, first detected in the Western Hemisphere in 1999, is spread
by mosquitoes that become infected when they feed on infected birds. It
causes flu-like symptoms in the mildest cases.
