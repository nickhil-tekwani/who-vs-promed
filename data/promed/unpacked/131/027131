Grain growers are being urged to check wheat crops after reports of
Victoria's 1st stripe rust outbreak this season [2009]. The Department of
Primary Industries [DPI] senior plant pathologist Dr Grant Hollaway said
the outbreaks, in the Mallee [low rainfall area with small trees and shrub
vegetation], were not unexpected, following reports of the disease in
Queensland and northern New South Wales [ProMED-mail post 20090312.1019].

This season's [2009] early break and sowing of crops, coupled with wetter
seasonal conditions had been favourable for rust development, Dr Hollaway
said. Croppers need to begin checking their paddocks and be ready to spray
if necessary. The disease is better managed by applying fungicides early in
the epidemic rather than later.

Last season [2008], stripe rust was detected in [Victoria] regions at
tillering [ProMED-mail post 20080916.2897] and a spray was required in many
varieties to protect green leaf area until the onset of adult plant
resistance, which starts around ear emergence in certain varieties.

[Stripe rust, also called yellow rust, of cereals is caused by the fungus
_Puccinia striiformis_ var. _striiformis_. It causes yellow leaf stripes
and stunting of plants with yield losses of 40 to 100 per cent. It affects
wheat, some barley varieties, triticale, and a number of wild grasses.
Spores are wind dispersed in several cycles during the cropping season.
Grasses and volunteer crop plants may generate a "green bridge" providing
inoculum for the next crop. Disease management includes the use of
resistant varieties, fungicide applications, and control of volunteer crops.

New stripe rust strains with increased virulence have been reported in
recent years from Europe, North America, Australia, India, and are also
suspected to have emerged in China. Disease monitoring is important to
recognise new pathogen strains, and continuous resistance breeding is
required to keep ahead of pathogen adaptation.

In Australia, stripe rust outbreaks were reported in 2008 in several
states, which may have increased the available inoculum for the current
crops. Earlier in 2009, the disease was reported for flood-affected
northern New South Wales and the Esperance region of Western Australia, and
an alert was issued for the 2009 South Australian broadacre crops due to
the risk of interstate spread.
