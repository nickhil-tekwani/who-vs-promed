From 2012 through 30 April 2019, a total of 2428 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection and 839 associated deaths were reported globally to WHO under the IHR. The associated deaths reported to WHO were identified through follow-up with affected member states.

WHO risk assessment
Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high morbidity and mortality. Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with infected dromedary camels. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans, especially from close, unprotected contact with infected patients. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in healthcare settings.

The notification of these additional cases does not change WHO's overall risk assessment of MERS. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to dromedary camels, animal products (e.g., consumption of camel's raw milk), or humans (e.g., in a healthcare setting).

WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.

WHO advice
Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all member states to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Infection prevention and control (IPC) measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in healthcare facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV infection early because, as with other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS are non-specific. Therefore, healthcare workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection. Contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS. Airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol-generating procedures.

Early identification, case management, and isolation, together with appropriate infection prevention and control measures, can prevent human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.

WHO recommends that comprehensive identification, follow-up, and testing of all contacts of MERS patients be conducted, if feasible, regardless of the development of symptoms, since approximately 20% of all reported MERS cases have been reported as mild or asymptomatic. The role of asymptomatic MERS-CoV infection in transmission is not well understood. However, reports of transmission from an asymptomatic MERS patient to another individual have been documented.

MERS causes more-severe disease in people with underlying chronic medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and compromised immune systems. Therefore, people with these underlying medical conditions should avoid close unprotected contact with animals, particularly dromedary camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.

Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking camel's raw milk or camel urine or eating camel meat that has not been properly cooked.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

[Of the 9 cases reported during the period 9-30 Apr 2019, none were in healthcare workers, 5 were classified as secondary cases, and 4 were classified as primary cases (2 with a history of camel contact). Diabetes was a co-morbidity for 6 of the 9 cases, but in only 1 of the 3 fatal cases.

Globally, as of 30 Apr 2019, there have been 2428 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported to WHO, including 839 associated deaths, for an overall reported case fatality rate of 34.6%. - Mod.MPP]

[3] Study on healthcare-associated outbreaks

Study of healthcare-linked MERS outbreaks finds variation, useful lessons
------------------------------------------
An analysis of 11 MERS-CoV hospital outbreaks from 2015-2017 found substantial differences among them, highlighting complex factors that lead to case clusters. Researchers from France, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, and the World Health Organization (WHO) reported their findings [14 May 2019] in Scientific Reports [see abstract below].

The 11 outbreaks included 423 lab-confirmed MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) cases. Ten outbreaks occurred in Saudi Arabia and 1 in South Korea, an event triggered by a traveler returning from the Middle East that sickened 186 people. The investigators defined a healthcare outbreak as one that had 5 or more lab-confirmed, epidemiologically linked cases documented in a single facility with no more than 14 days between patients' symptom onsets.

The researchers found that the length and epidemic profiles of the outbreaks varied, some starting with a sharp rise in cases, with others beginning more slowly with isolated cases detected for a few weeks before a cluster emerged. Also, their analysis revealed that some outbreaks had a sharp decline in cases, though others had a long tail lasting several weeks after the peak.

The reproduction number (R0) early in the outbreak was as high as 5.7 in South Korea, which the team notes probably reflects multiple superspreading events at 2 hospitals.

A key public health lesson is how long it took to bring the outbreaks under control, the group wrote. All of the events reached an R0 value below 1 within 2-6 weeks after the 1st cases were identified, highlighting the timeframe in which hospital and health ministry officials can put control measures in place to stop hospital-related outbreaks.

The authors said the differences in outbreak size and duration might reflect variations in how quickly cases were suspected and the timing of interventions. Also, the factors were affected by superspreading events early in some outbreaks. Also, the study confirmed earlier findings that age and underlying health conditions relate to increased risk of death. Investigators also found that being a healthcare worker was protective, which they said might be explained by younger age, fewer chronic health conditions, and earlier illness identification.

Sci Rep. 2019 May 14; 9(1): 7385. doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-43586-9. (Full article available at https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-43586-9.)

Abstract:
"Since its emergence in 2012, 2260 cases and 803 deaths due to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have been reported to the World Health Organization. Most cases were due to transmission in healthcare settings, sometimes causing large outbreaks. We analyzed epidemiologic and clinical data of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases from 11 healthcare-associated outbreaks in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Republic of Korea between 2015-2017. We quantified key epidemiological differences between outbreaks. Twenty-five percent (n = 105/422) of MERS cases who acquired infection in a hospital setting were healthcare personnel. In multivariate analyses, age [greater than or equal to] 65 (OR 4.8, 95%CI: 2.6-8.7) and the presence of underlying comorbidities (OR: 2.7, 95% CI: 1.3-5.7) were associated with increased mortality, whereas working as healthcare personnel was protective (OR 0.07, 95% CI: 0.01-0.34). At the start of these outbreaks, the reproduction number ranged from 1.0 to 5.7; it dropped below 1 within 2-6 weeks. This study provides a comprehensive characterization of MERS HCA-outbreaks. Our results highlight heterogeneities in the epidemiological profile of healthcare-associated outbreaks. The limitations of our study stress the urgent need for standardized data collection for high-threat respiratory pathogens, such as MERS-CoV."

An expression that comes to mind here is that once you've seen one healthcare-associated outbreak, you've seen one healthcare-associated outbreak, given the heterogeneity of the epidemiology of the outbreaks. Walk-away observations are that 25% of healthcare-associated cases are in healthcare workers; severity of disease and poor outcomes are associated with age over 65 years and underlying co-morbidities. Healthcare workers have better outcomes not unrelated to their younger ages and absence of co-morbidities. The observed case fatality rates among healthcare workers was 2%, compared with 36% among non-healthcare workers.

While the median number of reported cases per outbreak was 10, the range of cases was from 5-186; the median duration of the outbreaks was 20 days, with the range being 10-57 days. The larger outbreaks were associated with superspreaders.

The authors highlight that they "continue to encourage the policy of identifying, following, and testing of all high-risk contacts of MERS patients in HCA-outbreaks. The natural history of asymptomatic infection and role of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic HCP (healthcare personnel) in transmission of the virus between patients requires detailed scientific studies to better understand their potential role in transmission." - Mod.MPP]
