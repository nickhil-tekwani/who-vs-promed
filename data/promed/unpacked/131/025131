As of 14:00 [2:00 PM] today [Fri 9 Jun 2017], there have been a total of:
1648 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including
668 deaths [reported case fatality rate 40.5 percent],
943 recoveries, and
37 currently active cases/infections.

[As previously mentioned, the numbers of deaths, recoveries and currently active cases come from my spreadsheet tallies and differ from those listed on the Saudi MOH website; my spreadsheet counts asymptomatic infections. - Mod.MPP]

Since the last ProMED-mail update [Thu 8 Jun 2017], there have been a total of:
6 newly confirmed cases/infections [6 asymptomatic contacts]
0 newly reported fatalities, and
1 newly reported recovery.

Information on newly confirmed cases
6 asymptomatic infections
- all expat females
- all from Riaydh [Riyadh Region]
- all in healthcare workers
- all listed as currently stable
- all classified as secondary healthcare acquired cases in healthcare workers.)

Ages of the 6 newly confirmed infected individuals:
26-years-old
28-years-old
31-years-old
34-years-old
48-years-old
27-years-old

Information on newly reported recovery:
- A 58-year-old expat male, non-healthcare worker from Riyadh [Riyadh region] with a history of pre-existing co-morbidities. [most likely the 58-year-old expat male reported as a newly confirmed asymptomatic infection yesterday 8 Jun 2017 at which time he was noted to be in stable condition. He was classified as a secondary hospital acquired case in a patient. - Mod.MPP]

[Nosocomial transmission in Riyadh continues with 6 newly confirmed asymptomatic infections in healthcare workers. Of interest was a report carried on CIDRAP (the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy of the University of Minnesota) published yesterday [Thu 8 Jun 2017] which mentioned that according to "Maria Van Kerkhove, PhD, an epidemiologist who is the WHO's technical lead for MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus), the cases are from different Riyadh hospitals. She added that Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Health (MOH) is conducting extensive contact tracing, which includes testing high-risk contacts, even if they don't have symptoms." (see http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2017/06/saudi-arabia-probing-several-hospital-mers-clusters-riyadh). Shedding light on the observation that there are multiple foci of transmission ongoing in Riyadh at this time.

Since 1 June 2017 there have been 34 reports of newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection in Saudi Arabia of whom all but 3 were reported from Riyadh, with 23 of these reports involving asymptomatic contacts of confirmed clinically ill MERS-CoV infected individuals.

I repeat my question of yesterday [Thu 8 Jun 2017] - what is going on here? Are there improved testing protocols for asymptomatic contacts? Has the virus undergone change that permits easier transmissibility among human hosts?
