[Re: ProMED-mail Salmonellosis - Australia: (WA) papaya 20090917.3263]

The _Salmonella enterica_ serotype associated with this pawpaw
(papaya) outbreak in Western Australia is _Salmonella_ Saintpaul. A
case series investigation found that 11 recent Western Australian _S._
Saintpaul cases reported eating pawpaw during their incubation period.
As pawpaw is not frequently eaten (0 of 47 previously investigated
_Salmonella_ cases, various serotypes, reported eating pawpaw), pawpaw
sampling was conducted, and _S._ Saintpaul was detected on 3 of 6
whole pawpaws collected from a fruit market. At this stage
contamination is linked to one grower, and pawpaw from this grower has
been withdrawn.

A previous _Salmonella_ Litchfield outbreak in 2006 [see ProMED ref.
below] in Western Australia was caused by contaminated pawpaw from the
same growing region, and in this previous outbreak dipping fruit in
untreated river water to add fungicide was the likely cause of
contamination.

Environmental investigation has commenced to determine the source of
contamination with this new outbreak.

_S. enterica_ serotype involved in this outbreak. - Mod.LL]

[It is interesting that the fruit concerned could be contaminated with
fungicide as well as salmonella. - Mod.JW]
