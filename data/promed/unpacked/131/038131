News Release from the Texas Animal Health Commission [edited]
Water, Water Everywhere Raises Risk of Livestock Disease
----------------------------------------------------
Rushing water, stagnant ponds, or even the dry stages after wet
periods can lead to outbreaks of livestock disease. Mosquitoes and
biting flies, capable of carrying and transmitting diseases, thrive
in the damp weather, and naturally-occurring anthrax can take a toll
on livestock and wildlife when pastures dry after prolonged wet periods.
Horse owners should take precautions against mosquito-transmitted
diseases by having their animals vaccinated against West Nile virus
(WNV) and the reportable diseases Eastern and Western equine
encephalitis (EEE and WEE). "If you wait until cases of 'sleeping
sickness' occur in your area, you may have waited too long to
vaccinate," said Dr. Bob Hillman, Texas' state veterinarian and head
of the Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC), the state's livestock
and poultry health regulatory agency.
"You need time for the vaccine to do its job, which is to build the
animal's immunity to a particular disease," he said. "Vaccine can
provide the best disease protection possible, but it's also crucial
to keep up with booster shots, as recommended by the vaccine
manufacturer or your private veterinary practitioner. In 2006, 111
horses were confirmed to have West Nile Virus in Texas. So far this
year [2007], the disease has been confirmed in one horse, located in
Willacy County."
A total of 3 cases of Potomac horse fever, which is not a regulatory
disease, have been confirmed in Kerr County by the Texas Veterinary
Medical Diagnostic Laboratory. Potomac horse fever, first detected in
Maryland in l979, is not typically found in Texas. Clinical cases
usually are found near rivers, streams, ponds or canals. The
infection involves tiny flukes that are parasites of water
snails. The flukes hatch their offspring into the water, and these
are then picked up by aquatic insects that molt into flying insects,
including caddis flies and mayflies. Horses can become exposed to
Potomac horse fever when they eat or drink anything contaminated with
the insects.
Kerr County equine veterinarians are urging all owners to call their
practitioner if equine animals exhibit signs of Potomac horse fever,
which can include a reluctance to eat, fever, diarrhea, colic or
inflammation around the hoof. Treatment includes antibiotics and
supportive care.

[Texas has had an unusually high amount of rain of this year [2007].
It appears it is a mixed bag of blessings, bring more insects and
flooding than many residents have seen in years.
Potomac horse fever (PHF) is an acute enterocolitis syndrome
producing mild colic, fever, and diarrhea in horses of all ages, as
well as abortion in pregnant mares. The causative agent, formerly
known as _Ehrlichia risticii_, has recently been renamed
_Neorickettsia risticii_ because of its lesser genetic relationships
to other Ehrlichia groups. The infection of enterocytes of the small
and large intestine results in acute colitis, which is one of the
principal clinical signs of PHF. The disease is seen in spring,
summer, and early fall and is associated with pastures bordering
creeks or rivers. Recently, the epidemiology of PHF has been shown to
involve a trematode vector. Sporadic disease caused by _N risticii_
has been reported in dogs and cats; cattle appear to be resistant to
infection. PHF has been reported in many areas of the USA and Canada
using an indirect fluorescent antibody test as evidence of exposure;
however, recent studies indicate a high rate of false-positive titers
with this test, and the true geographic range of distribution is not
known. Isolation or detection of the causative agent from clinical
cases of PHF using conventional cell culture or PCR assay has been
reported only from California, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland,
Michigan, New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas,
and Virginia.
_N risticii_ is a gram-negative obligate intracellular bacterium with
a trophism for monocytes. Initial morphologic studies of this
organism isolated from cell culture, as well as the serologic
responses of _N risticii_, caused this bacterium to be assigned to
the genus Ehrlichia. Recent DNA analyses have revealed _N risticii_
is most closely related to _N helminthoeca_ , the agent of salmon
poisoning in dogs, and _Ehrlichia sennetsu_, a disease of humans in
Japan. The organism is not visible in monocytes in blood films from
clinical cases in contrast to _Ehrlichia (Anaplasma) equi_ , which is
readily identifiable in granulocytes of infected horses.
Recently _N risticii_ has been identified in freshwater snails and
isolated from trematodes released from the snails. _N risticii_ DNA
was detected in 13 species of immature and adult caddisflies
(_Trichoptera_), mayflies (_Ephemeroptera_), damselflies (_Odonata_,
_Zygoptera_), dragonflies (_Odonata_, _Anisoptera_), and stoneflies
(_Plecoptera_). Transmission studies using _N risticii_ -infected
caddisflies have reproduced the clinical disease. One route of
exposure is believed to be inadvertent ingestion of aquatic insects
that carry _N risticii_ in the metacercarial stage of a trematode.
The incubation period is about 10-18 days. The causative organism is
present in the feces of experimentally infected horses, but the
biologic significance of this is unknown. Clinically ill horses are
not contagious and can be housed with susceptible horses. Future
studies are needed to determine the exact role of the vector and
helminth hosts in the complex maintenance cycle of _N risticii_.
The clinical features of PHF are typified initially by mild
depression and anorexia, followed by a fever ranging from 102-107 DEG
F (38.9-41.7 DEG C). At this stage, intestinal sounds can be
decreased. Within 24-48 hours, a moderate to severe diarrhea, with
feces ranging in consistency from that usually seen in cows to
watery, develops in approximately 60 percent of affected horses. The
onset of diarrhea is often accompanied by mild abdominal discomfort.
Some horses develop severe toxemia and dehydration. Laminitis can
supervene as a severe complication of PHF in up to 40 percent of
affected horses. Hematologic findings vary in the early stage of PHF
from leukopenia (characterized by neutropenia and lymphopenia) to a
normal hemogram, despite evidence of systemic toxicity. A common
finding in cases of PHF is a marked leukocytosis, which is normally
observed within a few days of onset. PHF may present with all or any
combination of these clinical signs.
Several months following clinical disease in pregnant mares, abortion
due to fetal infection with _N risticii_ may occur. Experimentally,
pregnant mares infected at 100-160 days of gestation abort at 190-250
days of gestation. The abortion is accompanied by placentitis and
retained placenta. Fetal lesions include colitis, periportal
hepatitis, and lymphoid hyperplasia of mesenteric lymph nodes and
spleen. Necropsy findings in nonpregnant horses with enterocolitis
are nonspecific and reveal diffuse inflammation, mainly in the large
intestines.
Diagnosis:
A provisional diagnosis of PHF often is based on the presence of
typical clinical signs and the seasonal and geographic occurrence of
the disease. A definitive diagnosis of PHF should be based on
isolation or detection of _N risticii_ from the blood or feces of
infected horses. Serologic testing is of limited value as a
diagnostic tool, although many infected horses have high antibody
titers at the time of infection. Because of the high prevalence of
false-positive titers, interpretation of the indirect fluorescent
antibody test in individual horses is difficult. Isolation of the
agent in cell culture, although possible, is time-consuming and not
routinely available in many diagnostic laboratories. A recently
developed real-time PCR assay allows the detection of _N risticii_
DNA within 2 hours, making this a much more feasible test for routine
diagnostic examination. To enhance the chances of detection of _N
risticii_, the assay should be performed on a blood as well as a
fecal sample, as the presence of the organism in blood and feces may
not necessarily coincide.
Treatment:
PHF can be treated successfully with oxytetracycline (6.6 mg/kg, IV,
bid), if given early in the clinical course of the disease. A
response to treatment is usually seen within 12 hours. This is
associated with a drop in rectal temperature, followed by an
improvement in demeanor, appetite, and borborygmal sounds. If therapy
is begun early, clinical signs frequently resolve by the 3rd day of
treatment. Generally, antimicrobial therapy is for no more than 5
days. In animals exhibiting signs of enterocolitis, fluids and NSAID
should be administered. Laminitis, if it develops, is usually severe
and often refractory to treatment.
Prevention:
Several inactivated, whole-cell vaccines based on the same strain of
_N risticii_ are commercially available. Although vaccination has
been reported to protect 78 percent of experimentally infected
ponies, it has been marginally protective in the field. Vaccine
failure has been attributed to antigenic and genomic heterogeneity
among the more than 14 different strains of _N risticii_ isolates
from naturally occurring cases. Furthermore, vaccine failure may also
be due to lack of antibody protection at the site of exposure,
because the natural route of transmission has been determined to be
oral ingestion of the agent. Reduction of snail numbers in rivers and
ditches may be attempted to lessen sources of infection. No zoonotic
risk is known.
