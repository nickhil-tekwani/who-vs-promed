In response to the report of China Daily dated 18 Dec 2004, please note
that HKSAR has recorded a case of brucellosis in Oct 2004. The woman was
infected in Mainland China.
A human case of brucellosis
----------------------------
In late Oct 2004, CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch (PHLSB)
confirmed a case of human brucellosis. The patient was a 34-year-old
housewife, who suffered from recurrent headache and fever since mid Sep
2004. She was admitted to a hospital on 7 Oct 2004 because of pyrexia of
unknown origin without other focal symptoms or signs. Blood tests were
grossly normal except for liver derangement (ALT 280). Blood culture
yielded slow-growing Gram-negative coccobacilli, which was later identified
as _Brucella_ species in PHLSB, with species identification result
pending. The patient recalled a history of handling and consuming sheep
placenta outside Hong Kong. She was discharged on 26 Oct 2004 and put on
antimicrobial therapy including doxycycline and rifamipicin. Laboratory
staff who handled the specimens were asymptomatic.
