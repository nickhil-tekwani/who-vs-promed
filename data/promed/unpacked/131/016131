Death toll from encephalitis B [Japanese encephalitis] rises to 19
-----------------------------------------------
The death toll from an outbreak of encephalitis B [the current name:
Japanese encephalitis or JE], has risen to 19, with 38 people infected in
Yuncheng City of Shanxi Province, the local health authorities said on
Saturday [12 Aug 2006].
The city reported the summer's 1st case of encephalitis B [JE] on 13 Jul
2006, said the city's disease prevention and control center.
Encephalitis B [JE] causes an inflammation of the brain that can be
contracted by people of all ages. It is usually the result of a viral
infection passed to humans by mosquitoes. The illness begins with flu-like
symptoms and severe headaches.
Nine out of the 13 counties of the city, which has a population of 5
million, have reported cases of encephalitis B [JE], said the center.
The patients are receiving treatment in hospitals of Yuncheng and Yongji
cities and Linyi County.
Among the 12 patients who are being treated at the No. 2 Hospital of
Yuncheng, 8 are in serious condition, and doctors are trying to save their
lives, said Zhang Dinglin, deputy head of the hospital.
The Shanxi Provincial Health Department has allocated 400 000 [doses of]
encephalitis B [JE] vaccines to Yuncheng, which had only 20 000 doses on
hand, said Wang Jinsheng, deputy director of the center.
The vaccines will be allocated to different counties according to the
severity of the epidemic, Wang said.
The vaccinations will be given away free, but people will be charged 3 yuan
[USD 0.37] to administer the injection, according to Wang.
The people in Yuncheng are being told in a media blitz to clean up their
neighborhoods by sweeping away pools of standing water in which mosquitoes
can breed. Yunchang's hot weather and frequent rains have provided ideal
conditions for mosquitoes to breed. As temperatures drop next month
[September 2006], so will the number of cases of encephalitis, said Feng
Lizhong, an official with the Shanxi Provincial Health Department.
Six experts from the China Disease Prevention and Control Center (CDPCC),
dispatched by China's Ministry of Health, arrived at Yuncheng on Friday [11
Aug 2006]. They have visited patients and collected samples of the virus
for laboratory analysis.
The team of experts are working with the Shanxi Provincial Health
Department on urgent measures to prevent the spread of the deadly disease.
Over 80 percent of the victims found in the city are people over the age of
30, said Liang Guodong, leader of the team of experts and director of the
virus research institute of the CDPCC.

Encephalitis kills 14 more in Henan
-----------------------------------------
An outbreak of mosquito-borne encephalitis B [JE] has killed another 14
people in China, adding to 26 deaths already reported, a state newspaper
said on Friday [25 Aug 2006].
Health authorities in central Henan province said the fatalities were among
437 people who had been infected [by JE] since July 2006, a sharp jump from
the number of infections reported in the 1st half of the year, the Beijing
News said.
The peak period for infections of the disease, which causes inflammation of
the brain, had passed, and there would not likely be another big outbreak
this year [2006], it added.
The report gave no reason for the sudden spike in infections.
Earlier this month [August 2006], Chinese media reported that the disease
had killed 19 people in the northern province of Shanxi and 7 in
neighboring Shaanxi, infecting more than 200 others in both provinces.

Henan, Shanxi and Shaanxi share borders in the central part of China, as shown.
JE is caused by JEV-infected mosquitoes. JEV is transmitted to humans by
infected mosquitoes. Wild birds are the vertebrate reservoirs of the
virus. Pigs often serve as amplifying hosts. Prevalence of JEV infection
is more likely in rural settings yet could take place readily in the
suburban or peri-urban areas of a typical metropolitan city like Shanghai,
where traditional agricultural activities exist, such as rice fields
submerged in shallow water.
_Culex tritaeniorhynchus_, _Cx.gelidus_, and related vector species often
breed in abandoned rice fields, puddles, or other wet areas that can be
found in rapidly expanding suburban areas in developing countries. Henan is
a typical agricultural province, where the majority of the over 100 million
inhabitants are farmers.
JE can be prevented by vaccines. To avoid epidemics, regular public
awareness campaigns by local health authorities about the importance of
eliminating mosquito breeding grounds during the rainy season are of great
importance for public health. - Mods.RY and TY]
