Bird Flu Alarm In Turkey; Turkey, Romania slaughter more
fowl to combat bird flu
-----------------------------------------------
Mustafa Altuntas, chairman of the Turkish Veterinarians'
Union, has indicated on Tuesday [11 Oct 2005] that, aside
from the Manyas region in the north western city of
Balikesir, bird flu cases may be seen in other wetlands. "We
must take the necessary measures and inform the public about
bird flu," said Altuntas.
Altuntas remarked that Turkey is the 25th country to
experience bird flu cases. "The bird flu virus spreads by
migrating birds. As Turkey welcomes thousands of migrating
birds, there is a great possibility that the bird flu virus
will spread to other wetlands in Turkey," said Altuntas.
According to Altuntas, the bird flu virus can spread by
excrement and glandular secretions of sick animals. To date,
over 7000 animals (chickens and turkeys combined) have been
culled in Turkey.
Altuntas stressed that the bird flu is not a temporary
problem in Turkey. "Since birds fly into the northern
hemisphere from the south during spring, the Turkish
Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs must take the
necessary steps to deal with the epidemic and increase the
number of veterinarians to about 6000 from the present
2000," said Altuntas.
Meanwhile, Turkish Minister of Agriculture and Rural Affairs
Mehdi Eker has expressed that the bird flu detected in
Balikesir has been exaggerated. "We are witnessing a war of
words. Everyone tries to make a statement. Some of these
statements are being exaggerated and made news stories that
are far from reality," noted Eker.
Eker commented that so far there has only been one case of
bird flu detected in Manyas, Balikesir. He added that the
Turkish government has taken all the measures to avoid the
spread of bird flu. "We are ready to deal with bird flu in
every way."

Romania finds no new bird flu cases, keeps culling
--------------------------------------------------
Romania has found no new cases of avian flu in dead birds so
far, but will continue culling poultry in the Danube delta
near the Black Sea to prevent the disease from spreading,
authorities said on Tuesday [11 Oct 2005].
3 ducks that tested positive for bird flu on Friday [7 Oct
2005] remain the only birds in which disease antibodies have
been detected. But officials said testing of suspect cases
would go on with the help of European Union experts.
"There was no other positive case," Agriculture Ministry
spokesman Adrian Tibu said. "Dozens of samples are tested
each day." He said EU experts were helping local scientists
isolate the virus and send samples from the ducks to Britain
to discover whether they are dealing with the H5N1 strain
deadly for humans.
If the Romanian cases do turn out to be H5N1, it will be the
1st evidence the virus has spread to Europe from Asia, where
it has killed 65 people and millions of birds since 2003.
EU veterinary officers are due to meet in Brussels on
Wednesday [12 Oct 2005], by when the results of bird flu
tests from Romania and Turkey, which has also reported an
outbreak, should be known. Romania hopes to join the bloc in
2007. Experts fear the bird flu virus could mutate into one
which spreads easily between humans, creating a pandemic
that could kill millions of people worldwide.
Romanian officials said tens of thousands of domestic birds
would be killed in villages in the delta, which is Europe's
largest wetland and a major migratory area for wild birds
coming from Russia, Scandinavia, Poland, and Germany.
Television stations showed veterinarians wearing protective
suits and masks walking from house to house, sparking
protests from villagers in Ceamurila de Jos, where the bird
flu cases were found last week [1st week October 2005].
"All 17 000 birds in this village will be killed as a
precautionary measure," veterinarian Emil Trocan from the
affected county of Tulcea told Reuters. "People will receive
damages." He said around 45 000 domestic birds in the
region, which relies heavily on poultry for food, would have
to be culled.
The government allocated one million lei (USD 337 359) on
Monday [10 Oct 2005] to compensate those whose birds are
killed and also promised to help people with food and water
from state reserves.

Virus not confirmed, but bird flu hysteria goes on
--------------------------------------------------
Although a verdict on the existence of a bird flu epidemic
in Romania has not yet been given, the related hysteria has
already settled in. With the virus not yet confirmed,
poultry are being sacrificed in high numbers, to breeders'
despair. Breeders are making calculations and bracing up for
major losses, with possible drops in poultry prices, while
an increasing number of countries are taking extreme
protection measures.
Media agencies claim at least 13 countries have suspended
meat imports from Romania, yet Bucharest authorities deny
such information, claiming no official notification in this
respect has been received. "There is an International
Epizooties Organisation; no restrictive measure can be taken
without this organization notifying the presence of some or
another animal disease type. This is not the case with
Romania, and we haven't been officially informed by
neighboring states or the European Union," says minister
delegate for commerce Iuliu Winkler.
International norms require that such restrictive measures
should be officially notified, and this can only be done
upon the advice of the International Epizooties Organisation
[OIE]. The European Union is expected to take a decision
only today [12 Oct 2005] regarding the poultry imports from
Romania, because for the time being, there are no
indications confirming bird flu in Romania. For the moment,
European authorities have temporarily suspended imports from
Turkey, where the presence of bird flu has been confirmed.
Press agencies claim that Hungary, Poland, Greece, Austria,
Ukraine, Bulgaria, Albania, Bosnia Herzegovina, Croatia,
Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro, and Kosovo have already
taken this measure. Yesterday [11 Oct 2005], Swissinfo
announced that Switzerland joined the countries that
embargoed imports from Romania.
Bulgaria in its turn is investigating the causes of the
deaths of 3 birds in the northern part of the country, but
authorities in Sofia say there can be various causes. The
dead birds have been found in various areas of the Pleven
region, about 100 km away from the Romanian border, and they
were sent to the Bulgarian capital for analysis. "So far,
there are no bird flu cases in Pleven," a specialist with
the Bulgarian Regional Veterinary Authority announced.
Authorities added that the tests were only run for safety
purposes after Romania and Turkey had reported suspected
cases of bird flu. "We ordered bird examination, but we have
no reasons to believe it is bird flu," an official with the
Public Health Ministry also stated.
Bird elimination necessary
In the meantime, authorities carry on the confiscation and
killing of birds in the Ceamurlia de Jos area (Tulcea),
where the 3 suspect birds had been found. All other fowl in
the village will be seized and killed -- that is, over 15
000. Expected to arrive in Ceamurlia de Jos are also British
experts who will come to analyze the situation and collect
new samples. Veterinarians brought from 3 counties in
Romania state that elimination of the birds is an absolute
requirement, although the presence of the virus was not yet
confirmed. The National Veterinary Authority pointed out
that the dead birds in counties such as Botosani, Galati and
Iasi have nothing to do with bird flu, and they died either
of food poisoning or of hunger. 20 dead chickens were found
yesterday [11 Oct 2005] evening in a village in Botosani,
yet specialists stated the most likely cause of the deaths
was a disease people know as "bird plague." ["fowl plague"
used to be synonymous with highly pathogenic avian
influenza; the author/translator might have rather meant
"fowl cholera," an infectious disease of poultry, avian
pasteurellosis, caused by _Pasteurella multocida_, which
affects all types of birds, often fatal. - Mod.AS]
Precautionary measures, compensation
As a precaution, an emergency ordinance prohibiting hunting
in the Danube Delta and Tulcea area was endorsed by the
government on Monday (10 Oct 2005) night. Moreover, all
vehicles traveling from Tulcea to Constanta are stopped and
disinfected. The veterinary experts' intervention is
monitored by gendarme troops to avoid any incidents.
Police and gendarme forces have already been deployed in
Tulcea County, and they frequently had to face the anger of
villagers who opposed bird confiscation. On Monday night,
the Government decided on the amount of compensation to be
paid to people whose poultry had been sacrificed. Thus,
compensations will range from ROL 60 000 to 80 000 (USD 2.00
to 2.67) per kg of live bird, depending on the damages
incurred in each case. The total amount earmarked for
compensation funding reaches ROL 10 billion (USD 334 286).
Also in Monday's meeting, the government decided to allocate
another ROL 40 billion (USD 1 337 240) to the National
Veterinary Authority for procurement of protection,
disinfecting and bird flu testing equipment.

The European Union has said it has so far found no evidence
of the presence of bird flu in Romania. A spokesman said
tests on suspected cases had come back negative, and experts
were hopeful that further examination would confirm this.
Romania culled thousands of birds amid fears of an outbreak
of the H5N1 virus, deadly to humans, after 3 ducks were
found dead in a remote village.
Test results on separate samples from Turkey are expected
later in the week [2nd week October 2005]. Ankara is racing
to contain a suspected outbreak at a turkey farm in the
western town of Kiziksa.
Meanwhile, fears about a Bulgarian outbreak have so far
proven unfounded, although the authorities there are
carrying out tests on 3 dead wild birds.
No import ban:
EU veterinary experts are expected to meet later on
Wednesday [12 Oct 2005] to review the latest test results.
"All the virological tests carried out to date in Romania
have failed to identify the presence of the avian influenza
virus. Every day that passes ... reassures us that avian
influenza is not in fact present in Romania," said spokesman
Philip Tod.
Both Turkey and Romania fear the spread of H5N1, which has
killed more than 60 people in South East Asia over the past
2 years. There is no evidence so far of the strain being
passed between humans.
The Balkan neighbors of Romania and Turkey have banned
imports of poultry from the 2 countries, as have Ukraine and
Switzerland. The EU banned imports of live birds and
feathers from Turkey, but says it has no similar plans for
Romania.

Bird flu delegation tours model Thai farm
-----------------------------------------
Top US and UN health officials toured a Thai chicken farm on
Tuesday [11 Oct 2005] touted as a model for Asian nations
fighting a deadly bird flu virus that threatens to trigger a
global human pandemic.
Clad in rubber boots, white smocks and face masks, the
group, led by US health secretary Mike Leavitt in Thailand
on the 1st leg of a 4 nation tour, inspected biosecurity
measures on a small poultry farm 120 km (75 miles) north of
Bangkok. "Obviously we have seen good practices here, and
we'll see places where they are not so good," Leavitt said,
after trooping through a chicken shed on Sumali Srinual's
8000 bird farm.
Experts say the farm's shoe bath, disinfectant room and
plastic netting could be copied in a region where the virus
has thrived since late 2003 despite the slaughter of
millions of birds. They argue Asian farming methods, which
have seen people living cheek-to-jowl with their birds for
millennia, must change before the virus, now endemic in
Thailand, Cambodia, Viet Nam and Indonesia, can be stamped
out.
But these efforts have been ignored in the rush to find a
vaccine and stockpile antiviral drugs, said Alejandro
Thiermann, president of the International Animal Health Code
[commission] at the Paris-based animal health body OIE.
"There is much talk about humans but not about birds," he
said, adding that 10 per cent of the money spent on drug
research could have a big impact on fighting bird flu at the
farm level. "If we do it, we may never see the pandemic, and
we may never need those vaccines," said Thiermann, who is
accompanying Leavitt on the tour of Thailand, Cambodia,
Laos, and Viet Nam.
The UN Food and Agriculture Organization appealed in
February 2005 for USD 100 million from donor countries to
improve surveillance and control programs in South East
Asia. But only USD 30 million has been received or pledged
so far.
Old ways hard to change
Sumali paid 20 000 baht (USD 500) to upgrade her farm, which
is under contract to poultry exporter Chareon Pokphand. The
firm sets guidelines for its bird suppliers and can help
arrange bank loans to pay for the improvements. "I am afraid
of bird flu, but I have good protection," said Sumali,
dressed in a blue smock, black rubber boots and hair net.
Her farm is among 11 000 commercial farms that have boosted
security since bird flu began ravaging Thai poultry flocks
in late 2003, all but wiping out markets for what was then
the world's 4th largest poultry exporter.
"We are changing the way poultry farming is done," said
Agriculture Ministry official Nirandorn Uangtrakulsook. But
10 000 farms, mostly small and medium sized, have not made
upgrades despite the offer of low-interest loans through
state-owned banks. Many farmers complain they don't have
enough collateral.
Reforming Thailand's one million backyard farms -- where 10
million birds are raised for food or as fighting cocks and
live in close proximity with their owners -- is a bigger
challenge. "We cannot force them. We have been seeking the
cooperation of villagers to keep chickens away from where
they live," Nirandorn said.
The US delegation, which flew to Cambodia later on Tuesday
[11 Oct 2005], has urged countries in the region to step up
their surveillance to ensure new outbreaks are detected
quickly to prevent a wider spread of the disease.
But Thiermann feared farmers would not report cases if they
got little or no compensation for their culled flocks.
"These people have a lot to lose. If nobody is going to
compensate them, why should they report?," he said.

[Dr Thiermann has indeed hit a right, critical spot related
to avian influenza control efforts; the cooperation of
farmers is essential for any disease control or eradication
program. Without their confidence in secured, realistic
compensations, timely payable if flocks are to be stamped
out, information on suspected disease cases will be
withheld. This simple truth has been demonstrated in the
past in developed as well as in developing countries in
relation to various animal diseases; it is apparent also in
the current news items from Romania and Turkey. Combined
with efficient, properly equipped and well-manned veterinary
services, independent of political pressures and backed by
the necessary diagnostic capabilities, success might be
expected. - Mod.AS]
