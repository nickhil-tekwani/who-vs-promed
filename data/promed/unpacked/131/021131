Horses that attended high school rodeo events at Laramie, Rock Springs, or Big Piney should be monitored.

On 27 Apr 2018, the Wyoming Livestock Board received negative laboratory results for equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) in a blood sample from a horse in Carbon county. The horse had been showing hind limb neurologic signs. Nasal swabs had not been taken.

Still concerned about equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM), the owners were advised to impose a self-quarantine and closely monitor all horses for EHM signs, including taking temperatures on all horses twice daily. The attending veterinary clinic was advised to maintain isolation on the horse and to resubmit both blood and nasal samples.

On [2 May 2018], the results on nasal swab were reported as positive for EHV-1 wild type.

The premises was placed under quarantine with continued close monitoring on all 16 horses.

The affected horse had attended high school rodeos at Laramie on 7-8 April 2018, and Rock Springs on [14-15 Apr 2018]. Horses at either of these events potentially could have been exposed and should be monitored closely, preferably having temperatures taken twice daily. Any horses with a fever (101.5 deg F [38.6 deg C] or higher) or showing respiratory or neurologic signs should be isolated immediately and a veterinarian consulted as to ongoing management.

One horse from this premises had not showed any signs of infection or disease attended the high school rodeo at Big Piney. While risk is minimal, horses at that event should be monitored as well.

A 2nd case of a highly contagious, but rare horse disease has been confirmed in South Dakota, and officials in the region are urging horse owners to do what they can to help prevent the spread of the potentially fatal disease.

State Veterinarian Dustin Oedekoven said [Fri 4 May 2018] that the most recent case of equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy [EHM] was confirmed on [Mon 30 Apr 2018] and involved a horse that belonged to a member of the South Dakota State University rodeo team in Brookings.

The horse had just been at 2 rodeos over the weekend [28-29 Apr 2018] in Lincoln and Hastings, Nebraska, he said.

The other case, also involving a rodeo horse, was reported [10 Apr 2018] near Sioux Falls [South Dakota]. Both horses were treated and able to recover.

However, in the North Dakota case reported last month [April 2018], the horse had to be euthanized and was also tied to rodeos as it belonged to a member of a rodeo team in the southwest part of the state. Oedekoven also said they were previously aware of 2 cases in Wyoming near Gillette in recent months.

Oedekoven and Minnesota Board of Animal Health equine program manager Courtney Wheeler are urging horse owners to be vigilant, especially if they are traveling to rodeo and other public exhibition events.

In both South Dakota and Minnesota, the 2 said certificates of veterinary inspection and health are required for horses traveling out of state.

This verifies the horse has been examined by a veterinarian and is free from signs of communicable and contagious diseases.

Oedekoven said there is a vaccine for EHM -- which has a neurological and often fatal effect to it -- as well as for other forms of the disease. One of the related diseases found in younger animals is a respiratory form of the disease that can often be cured. Another form can affect mares and can cause abortions. Vaccines are also available for those forms of the disease.

EHM, however, is much more rare. For example, Oedekoven said the last case [in South Dakota] may have been as long ago as 2014. Wheeler said the last case in Minnesota that was reported was in 2015.

Wheeler, who is worried about Minnesota horses since the 3 cases reported in the Dakotas, said if a Minnesota horse is confirmed to be EHM positive or has been determined to be exposed to the disease, it must be quarantined. The board then works with herd veterinarians and horse owners to carry out testing and observation protocols defined in the control plan before the quarantines can be released.

Horse owners attending events need to adhere to rigorous and routine biosecurity practices to prevent the further spread of EHM and other contagious diseases, Wheeler and Oedekoven said.

Both of these articles are associated with rodeos. There is no indication in either that the horses were at the same rodeo, but clearly this type of congregating of equines and the stress of these sporting events are putting a great deal of horses at risk. While a certificate of veterinary inspection is appropriate, it is not a guarantee of health. The horse may be healthy when examined by the veterinarian but a week or so later may be incubating or presenting at another veterinarian's office with an illness.

While vaccines are available against the reproductive and respiratory forms of EHV-1, vaccination has not proven effective in preventing EHM from developing. Somewhere, it would seem a new vaccine protective against EHM could be developed. - Mods.TG/JH]
