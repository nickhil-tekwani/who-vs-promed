Iran: 2 Dead with Suspected Avian Influenza Symptoms
-----------------------------------------------
Two people have died in Iran showing possible symptoms of avian influenza
virus infection, a health official in the northwestern province of
Kermanshah said. "Four people have been hospitalized, among them a woman
and her husband, who have died. There are suspicions of bird flu symptoms,"
said the head of the University Hospital in the city, according the news
agency ISNA. "Their tests have been sent to medical centers inside the
country and abroad to clarify the issue," said the official, named only as
Dr. Izadi. "Another one of those hospitalized is in critical condition."
Iran announced in February 2006 that 135 wild swans found dead on the
Caspian Sea coast had tested positive for the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain
of avian influenza, in the 1st cases of the virus to be confirmed in the
Islamic Republic. The outbreak occurred in Gilan province, further north
[and east] from Kermanshah [see: Avian influenza - Eurasia (28): Syria,
Iran, planning 20060121.0203].
If the cases are confirmed in Kermanshah, they would be the 1st human
cases. The province of the same name borders Iraq, where at least 2 people
have died of avian influenza.
Iranian health and veterinary officials have been on high alert since
January 2006, after bird flu struck neighboring Turkey, with tens of
thousands of domestic birds destroyed along the border.

Iran: 2 Deaths Attributed to Avian Influenza Virus infection
-----------------------------------------------
Tests in Iran on the dead bodies of a 41-year-old man and his 26-year-old
sister showed they had the lethal H5N1 strain of bird flu, an Iranian
medical official who requested anonymity told Reuters on Monday [22 May
2006]. Serum samples from the 2 victims in the northwestern Iranian city of
Kermanshah would be sent abroad for further testing, the ISNA students news
agency reported earlier. If confirmed in international laboratories, these
would be the 1st human bird flu deaths in Iran.
The Islamic Republic 1st detected cases of bird flu inside the country in
February 2006, when the virus was found in wild swans. ISNA quoted a doctor
at Kermanshah's medical university as saying 4 patients had been tested, 2
of whom had died and one of whom was in critical condition.
The H5N1 virus remains mainly a virus of birds, but experts fear it could
change into a form easily transmitted from person to person and sweep the
world, killing millions within weeks or months. The virus has killed 123
people since late 2003, most of them in Asia, according to the most recent
figures from the World Health Organization. Iraq and Egypt have also
reported deaths from the virus in recent months. So far, most human cases
can be traced to direct or indirect contact with infected birds.

The province of Kermanshah lies to the west of Teheran and borders Iraq,
the city of Kermanshah being close to the border just north of Baghdad.
Gilan province, where the H5N1 outbreak in wild birds occurred, lies at a
distance to the northeast and borders the Caspian sea. The diagnosis of
avian influenza in the human patients in Kermanshah appears to be mainly on
the bias of signs and symptoms. The results of independent laboratory
testing abroad are not yet available. If confirmed, these cases will be the
1st human cases in Iran, and the Islamic Republic will become the 11th
country to report human cases of avian influenza. - Mod.CP]
