In the light of my experience as a former director of the CDC dengue lab in
San Juan, Puerto Rico, I would like to offer the following comments about
controlling the exploding dengue situation in Brazil.
When the situation reaches this level, government mosquito control efforts
can never be sufficient to deal with it. While ground or air spraying with
insecticide may kill 90% of the mosquitoes out in the open, many mosquitoes
are indoors and protected from the spray, and each day billions of new
mosquitoes hatch from protected breeding spots in discarded
water-containing bottles, cans and plastic containers, in pet and domestic
animal water dishes, flower vases in homes and cemeteries, and discarded
tires.
The only way to get rid of all these mosquitoes is for each householder to
take responsibility for cleaning up their own homes, gardens and property.
Thousands of sanitary guards can't do this, only the householders
themselves.
Let the sanitary guards take care of the abandoned properties, waste dumps,
tire dumps and streets. Instead of spending precious money on more spray
trucks, spend it on fixing transportation for the guards to do that, and
let the homeowner take care of the home.
Get the homeowners to put out by the road all the discarded containers and
tires that are in and around their homes, and arrange for trucks to pick
them up at no more than 3-day intervals (if you leave it longer, they will
just keep on breeding mosquitoes). Then dump them far from the city. If
you don't have enough trucks, appeal to the local Lions Club, social club
or trucking company to loan trucks for special weekend pickups. Announce
neighborhood cleanup campaigns on radio and TV, and ask the local brewery
to provide free beer for a party for the whole neighborhood at the end of
it -- this was very successful in Puerto Rico! Yes, Puerto Rico still has
dengue, but that is because people lost interest in these campaigns between
epidemics.
Gorgas succeeded in ridding Cuba and Panama of the yellow fever/dengue
mosquito, and Soper with the Brazilian government got rid of it in Brazil,
by imposing stiff fines on householders who did not keep their premises
free of mosquitoes. I am not advocating fines, but it proves that it is
the householders, not the government, who are the key to getting rid of
dengue -- and protecting Brazilian cities against the even greater threat
of urban yellow fever.
