Detection of _Pantoea stewartii_ in Italy
-----------------------------------------
In Italy, _Pantoea stewartii_ (EPPO A2 List) was detected during official surveys carried out in maize (_Zea mays_) fields in Friuli-Venezia Giulia region. In June 2017, a total of 8-10 symptomatic leaves were sampled from 1-5 maize plants growing in the same field (sample size varied according to the plant size). In August 2017, the identity of the bacterium was confirmed in symptomatic leaf samples.

Further surveys are being carried out to determine the distribution of the bacterium in Friuli-Venezia Giulia region. It is noted that in the infected area (7 ha) [17.3 acres] and its surroundings, maize is grown for forage only. The source of this outbreak is still unknown, but investigations are being carried out to clarify the origin of the seeds which have been used.

[Stewart's wilt of maize is caused by the bacterium _Pantoea stewartii_ subsp. _stewartii_. (Pss; previously _Erwinia stewartii_). The pathogen is indigenous to the Americas but has been introduced to other parts of the world with maize seed. Symptoms vary on different host varieties but may include leaf stripes, wilting, necrosis of tassels and spots on husks of cobs. Plants may be killed at the seedling stage, infection later in the growth cycle can lead to serious yield losses. Many grassy hosts are susceptible and may serve as pathogen reservoirs.

Primarily, the bacterium is transmitted by and overwinters in insect vectors, but it can also be seed transmitted at a low rate and occasionally overwinters in soil, manure or maize stalks. Insect vectors are mostly responsible for local spread, while infected seed is considered the main route of long distance spread and therefore a quarantine risk. Disease management may include insecticides to reduce vector populations, use of certified disease-free seed and use of resistant maize cultivars.

Pss also causes a leaf blight of rice and is considered an emerging pathogen of that crop (as is _P. ananatis_, ProMED-mail post 20170504.5012251). Pss fruit bronzing is considered an emerging disease of jackfruit in southern Asia (ProMED-mail posts 20170905.5294905 & 20171123.5460703).

The genus _Pantoea_ belongs to the family of _Enterobacteriaceae_, which also comprises genera pathogenic to animals or humans. However, the majority of its members are plant-associated. Other species in the genus can cause diseases on a number of crops, such as leaf blights of cereals (_P. agglomerans_), pink disease of pineapple (_P. citrea_), brown stalk rot of maize (_P. ananatis_ and a novel _Pantoea_ species), or center rot of onion (_P. ananatis_). The effects of different bacterial strains on hosts can vary dramatically. The bacteria are generally transmitted by insect vectors, plant material, and infected seed, making them a quarantine risk.
