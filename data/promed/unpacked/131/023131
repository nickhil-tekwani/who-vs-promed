VESICULAR STOMATITIS - USA (02)

The sharp eyes of Andy Comer, CDC, saw that I had posted the above without
realizing the etiologic agent was being reported as vesicular stomatitis
Indiana virus (family _Rhabdoviridae-, genus _Vesiculovirus_). Given that
this virus has not been isolated in the U.S. for more than 30 years, that was
clearly an oversight on my part and I apologize for not writing a footnote.
Andy is willing to write, for ProMED-mail, a small summary of the history of
vesiculoviruses in the U.S. but we both wanted to be certain that the virus
really is VS Indiana before we did so.
I found a telephone number through USDA's web site and spoke with someone who
was willing to provide what information he has. It was not at all
convincing, so we are withholding any postings (other than this one) and will
reserve comment until we have confirmatory information from National
Veterinary Services Laboratory or some other authority.

[This virus, VSI, is dear to my heart. In 1965 I was involved in an
investigation of vesicular stomatitis in Abiquiui, New Mexico. Bernie
Fields, Dan Sudia, and I published the first report of the isolation of this
virus from mosquitoes, _Aedes dorsalis_ if my memory serves. -- Mod CHC]
