Abstract
----------
1: The common hippopotamus _Hippopotamus amphibius_ (hippo) is a keystone species whose foraging activities and behaviour have profound effects on the structure and dynamics of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems within its habitat.

2: Although hippos are typically regarded as obligate herbivores and short-grass grazing specialists, field studies have demonstrated that hippos are facultative carnivores that consume flesh and intestinal tissues from the carcasses of other animals. Carnivory by hippos is not an aberrant behaviour restricted to particular individuals in certain localities, but a behaviour pattern that occurs within populations distributed in most of the hippo's current range in eastern and southern Africa. Carnivory is frequently associated with communal feeding involving multiple individuals or entire social groups of hippos.

3: The observed tendency of hippos to feed on carcasses, including those of other hippos, has important implications for the ecology and epidemiology of anthrax and other ungulate-associated zoonotic diseases in African landscapes. Scavenging and carnivory by hippos may explain why the spatiotemporal patterns and dynamics of anthrax mortality among hippos often differ markedly from those of other anthrax-susceptible herbivores within the same habitats, and why levels of hippo mortality from anthrax may be orders of magnitude higher than those of other anthrax-susceptible ungulate populations within the same localities.

4: Recognition of the role of carnivory as a key factor in modulating the dynamics of mass anthrax outbreaks in hippos can provide a basis for improved understanding and management of the effects of anthrax outbreaks in hippo and human populations.

Conclusions
------
Mass anthrax outbreaks in hippo populations can occur in the absence of evident contemporaneous anthrax mortality among other anthrax-susceptible herbivore species within the same habitat, or asynchronously and at orders-of-magnitude higher levels than that recorded among elephants, buffalo, and other anthrax-susceptible ungulate species within their habitats. We hypothesise that the observed anomalies associated with mass anthrax outbreaks among hippos can be attributed, at least in part, to carnivory and scavenging of anthrax-infected animal carcasses by hippos, including, but not limited to, those of dead hippos.

The available data indicate that carnivory by hippos is an inherent dimension of their fundamental ecological niche. The available data do not allow us to identify factors contributing to the expression of carnivory, as the behaviour was observed in different situations. Carnivory by hippos has been observed during droughts with putative nutritional stress, and also in situations of superabundant opportunistic resources, such as during mass anthrax outbreaks in hippos or mass drowning of wildebeest crossing the Mara River. Further observational studies and field experiments should be conducted to evaluate the behavioural response of hippos at different sites to the presence of nearby animal carcasses, and whether such a response varies seasonally. Additionally, the use of stable isotope analyses should be investigated. Such analysis could help us to identify the contribution of animal tissues to hippo diets, as has been done in chimpanzees (Fahy et al. 2013), in order to test whether carnivory in hippos has a nutritional relevance beyond an increased likelihood of anthrax infection.

Our hypothesis that carnivory and scavenging by hippos may serve as a principal driver for mass anthrax outbreaks in hippo populations has important implications for the management of anthrax outbreaks. The findings of this review indicate that the standard practice of burying or burning suspected anthrax-infected animal carcasses may be especially effective for the control of mass anthrax outbreaks in hippo populations, and that the effect of this measure should be scientifically evaluated.
