Wheat crops in Dorset are starting to show widespread levels of septoria, the crop's biggest yield-robbing disease. Todd Jex of agronomy group Agrii says the wet-loving disease has developed quickly due to the mild winter followed by rain during February [2019] in areas of Dorset and southern Wiltshire.

"For this time of the year, there is an awful lot of septoria around in crops, even those that were late drilled." Worryingly, those winter wheat varieties with good resistance to the disease are seeing high levels of septoria, adds Mr Jex. "We are seeing the disease more than we would have thought," he says.

Good establishment in the mild autumn has produced crops with lush leaf canopies leading to high humidity levels within the growing crop. This has helped the spread of disease. He is suggesting with plenty of septoria around it may worthwhile using a protectant fungicide along with a systemic one towards the end of March [2019].

[Septoria leaf blotch of cereals is caused by fungi in the septoria species complex, which includes _Zymoseptoria tritici_ (previously _Septoria tritici_), _Mycosphaerella graminicola_ and _Phaeosphaeria nodorum_ (previously _Stagonospora nodorum_). They affect mainly wheat, but also barley and oats and occasionally rye and some grass species. Symptoms on wheat and barley are very similar and may occur at any time during the growth cycle and on any portion of the plant. They include blotches on both leaves and glumes, which reduce the photosynthetic ability of the host. Disease development is favoured by humid conditions. Up to 50 percent yield losses have been reported on susceptible varieties.

Spores can be spread by infected plant material, wind, water (rain splash) and mechanical means. The pathogens can overwinter on crop debris and on autumn sown crops or volunteers. Disease management includes fungicide treatments aimed at preventing the disease becoming established on the upper 3 leaves of the crop canopy (where it would affect the ears most), removal of inoculum sources and use of resistant varieties. After the cereal rusts, the disease is considered the most important challenge to plant breeders (see ProMED-mail post 20120831.1274190) and a threat to food security worldwide.

Pathogen strains with high levels of resistance to many fungicides are emerging, for example, in the UK and other parts of Europe (ProMED-mail post 20160516.4225677), as well as Australia and New Zealand (ProMED-mail posts 20161031.4598540 and 20140417.2410219). With high disease levels reported above on wheat cultivars currently considered to be resistant to the pathogens, host resistance break down or emergence of new fungal strains in the area may be a possibility.
