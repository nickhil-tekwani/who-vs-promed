Tajikistan: Disease's reappearance pits authorities against NGO
-----------------------------------------------
At least 15 people have been hospitalized in Tajikistan with a
potentially deadly bacterial disease called leptospirosis. The
disease is generally transmitted through contact with animals or
tainted water. The flu-like symptoms can be nearly nonexistent or
nonspecific, but the risk to humans is very real. Experts say about
one in 10 patients may suffer major organ damage, and 3-5 percent of
cases are fatal. The Tajik cases represent the 1st outbreak in this
part of Central Asia in more than a decade. All of the cases so far
have occurred in a district that lies about 50 km east of the
capital, Dushanbe.
Health officials at the scene suspect the sudden infections might be
the result of recent work on the public water system. In a strange
twist, the replacement of old pipes had been financed by the Aga Khan
Foundation, a nonprofit group that has spent a decade doing good
deeds in the region. Officials appear to have seized on that
organization's role to deflect potential public anger.
Deputy Health Minister Nigina Sharofova stressed the local nature of
the outbreak at a news conference on 19 Apr 2006. "So that there
won't be any panic: The reason [for the outbreak] was that the Aga
Khan Foundation installed water pipes in that area, and it happened
that new pipes were connected to old pipes," Sharofova said. "And
many dead rats as well as other filth was found in those [old] pipes,
and in those parts where the [new and old] pipes were connected --
where the old pipes ended -- that is where the outbreak was registered."
The Aga Khan Foundation has worked for more than 10 years in
Tajikistan and neighboring Kyrgyzstan helping to repair damaged or
old sections of the infrastructure. It has backed improvements to
water pipes and power supplies as well as provided farming aid to
rural communities.
RFE/RL's Tajik Service contacted a representative of the Aga Khan
Foundation in the Tajik capital Dushanbe. Representative Mizrob
Amirbekov told RFE/RL's Tajik Service that it was not his
foundation's work, but unsanitary conditions that spread the disease.
"According to our representatives, that [outbreak] is not related to
our pipelines. There is no evidence that the pipes have microbes or
viruses," Amirbekov said.
The deputy head of Tajikistan's national epidemiological center,
Issakhan Gurezov, tended to discount the supposition that the pipes
were responsible. There have been occasional outbreaks of
leptospirosis in Central Asia in the past. But the last time Tajik
authorities recorded a case was the early 1990s.

The source of leptospirosis here is likely water-borne, but the exact
mechanism of spread is being debated.
