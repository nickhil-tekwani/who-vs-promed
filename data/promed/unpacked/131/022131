Latest information on avian influenza
-------------------------------------
An outbreak of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in poultry has
been suspected in Indonesia during the preceding month. The recent outbreak
in Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) appeared to be caused by
H7. Although the number of outbreaks appeared to be falling as it did
during 2004, the need for vigilance to find potential new cases and isolate
them rapidly remains a high priority. Biosecurity in domestic poultry
production systems must also be rechecked during this period.
Country situation
Cambodia:
4 fatal human cases have been confirmed since the end of January 2005, all
from Kampot Province. In the case of a 28 year old man, numerous deaths
among chickens in the area have been reported and samples taken from sick
chickens have tested positive for avian influenza. In the case of an 8 year
old girl, poultry deaths occurred in this Tram Sasor village, Bantey Meas
district in February. As for a 20 year old woman, there was no mortality of
poultry in her village, but poultry deaths occurred in a village where the
woman used to go to school. In Kampol Meas village, poultry deaths were
observed in late March/early April and continued into Khmer New Year (14-15
Apr 2005). A couple of chickens also died in nearby Phnom Srongab village.
Viet Nam:
No new outbreak of HPAI has been reported since 2 Apr 2005. But of more
than 10 000 random duck and geese samples gathered from poultry farms
across 10 Mekong Delta provinces, 71 per cent tested positive so far in
2005, according to a Government official. The virus was found in about 26
per cent of duck samples. A national conference on reviewing HPAI control
and prevention activities during the past 2 years was held on 18 Apr 2005
outlining a series of measures including readjustment of the poultry
production system and trading, slaughtering, processing, and transportation
of poultry and poultry products; strengthening the veterinary system at
farm level; completing the regulatory system to bring the disease under
control by 2006 or 2007, and eliminating the disease by 2010. On 19 Apr
2005, a ban on poultry farming in Vietnam's urban areas was extended from
Ho Chi Minh City to 15 cities and urban areas (Hanoi, the central cities of
Hue and Danang Provinces, Quang Ninh Province, and Can Tho Province), and
other measures were announced such as closure of small markets dealing in
live poultry in urban areas to be replaced by big slaughterhouses;
isolation of fowl production establishments from residential areas; a ban
on hatching and raising waterfowl extended to the end of 2005; and
restriction on the freedom of local farmers to breed waterfowl in fields.
Trials of inactivated vaccines are currently being carried out, and a trial
with 600 000 doses of a recombinant vaccine has been approved in HCMC. A
pilot vaccination in 2 provinces (Tien Giang and Nam Dinh) is planned for
July and August. Based on the outcome of the trials, a nationwide
vaccination strategy will be designed and a targeted vaccination
countrywide will be considered for October 2005. Since 30 Dec 2004, there
were 41 confirmed cases in Viet Nam reported by WHO, of which 16 were fatal.
Thailand:
The last outbreak was on 12 Apr 2005 at Lop Buri Province. The National
Strategic Plan for Avian Influenza Control Thailand was approved by the
Thai Cabinet on 25 Jan 2005 and has been operational. The plan includes:
development of a disease-free poultry management system; analysis of the
situation and preparation for use of vaccines for prevention of the disease
in poultry; disease surveillance and response during outbreaks; knowledge
generation and management; capacity building of organizations and manpower;
improvement of understanding and participation of the civil society and
private sectors; and development of sustainable integrated management
systems and mechanisms. Chicken exports this year [from] Thailand are
expected to reach 300 000 tonnes due to the easing of the bird flu
outbreak, according to the Thai Broiler Processing Exporters Association.
The poultry meat export from Thailand before HPAI crisis was 624 000 tonnes
(2003, FAOSTAT). The shipment will be mainly cooked products, since raw
poultry meat has been banned in big export markets such as Japan and Europe.
Indonesia:
30 chickens were found dead recently in Sidomulya subdistrict, Samarinda,
East Kalimantan near the end of April 2005. A university scientist in east
Java detected H5N1 virus in throat swabs and blood samples from a pig in
Surabaya by RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction).
Inactivated RNA isolates have been sent to the Tokyo University, where 8
fragments (HA, NA, PA, PB1, PB2, M, NP, NS) were sequenced. Results showed
that the virus was similar to the avian influenza virus from poultry,
characterised by high pathogenicity (based on the study regarding the
cleavage site). The gene for haemagglutinin of the isolated virus was more
than 98 per cent identical to samples taken from infected Indonesian
chickens and quail. The agriculture department will carry out sampling from
several pig farms.

[Teams from VSF-CICDA (Agronomes et Veterinaires sans Frontieres, or
Agronomists and Veterinarians without Borders) in Viet Nam and Cambodia, in
cooperation with FAO, prepared a new illustrated guide (36 pages) for
village animal health workers or paravets, titled "Prevention and Control
of Avian Flu in small-scale poultry: A Guide for veterinary
paraprofessionals". The manual is expected to be translated in several
South East Asian countries and will be distributed to veterinary
para-professionals. This practical guide should enable paravets to better
deal with avian influenza in backyard or small-scale poultry units. The
full English text is available at
