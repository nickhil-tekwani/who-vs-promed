Recent detections of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N8) in East Asia and Europe, A(H5N8) and A(H5N2) in North America, and A(H5N6) in East and Southeast Asia have prompted the WHO/OIE/FAO H5 Evolution Working Group (with input from OFFLU) to review and update the H5 haemagglutinin (HA) clade nomenclature (Refs 1-4), which was last revised based on sequence data available prior to December 2012 (4). [For details on the membership/affiliations of the Working Group and OFFLU, see footnotes (a) and (b) in the commentary].

Although a detailed report describing the update of the existing nomenclature is in preparation, considering the high likelihood that these viruses will continue to be detected and reported, timely communication of the new clade designation is warranted. The phylogenetic analysis of H5 HA sequences from these viruses revealed extensive divergence and indicated the need to update the clade nomenclature for H5N1, H5N2, H5N5, H5N6, and H5N8 subtype viruses clustering in this HA group. After careful analysis of all available H5 sequence data, this group of HA gene segments has been designated as clade 2.3.4.4, and use of this unified classification is recommended. The virology, animal and public health communities are encouraged to adopt this clade designation for these H5 HAs and discontinue use of the provisional clade 2.3.4.6 designation, which was assigned tentatively during the WHO Vaccine Virus Consultation in September 2014 in reviewing and selecting candidate vaccine viruses of this emerging group of viruses (5).

[ProMED-mail is grateful for the above firsthand information addressing H5 haemagglutinin (HA) clade nomenclature. We are glad to be instrumental in the early distribution of the essential data to relevant virology, animal and public health communities worldwide.

The 2.3.4.4 clade seems to be widely distributed, apparently circulating in Asia, Europe as well as North America. This calls for further epidemiological investigations into the mode of spread.

(a) The WHO/OIE/FAO H5 Evolution Working Group was established in 2007. It consists of representatives from international agencies (WHO, OIE, FAO) and academic institutes. Since its establishment, the committee has provided a framework and regular updates for the H5 nomenclature system.

(b) OFFLU is the OIE-FAO network of expertise on animal influenzas, which is a global network of animal influenza experts established in 2006 to support international efforts to control animal and zoonotic influenza viruses and to reduce pandemic risks. http://www.offlu.net/. - Mod.AS]

[For a proper understanding of this announcement interested readers should access the WHO September statement, which provides the background to this recommendation and in particular for a diagram of the structure of Clade 2.3.4.
