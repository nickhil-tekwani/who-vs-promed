Gov't confirms 6th outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease
-----------------------------------------------------
The government said Saturday [30 Jan 2010] it has confirmed the
country's 6th outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] this year at a
dairy cattle farm in Pocheon north of Seoul. The farm, located 3.8 km
[2.3 miles] away from where the 1st outbreak was confirmed on 7 Jan
2010, reported blisters on some of its animals on Friday, the
agriculture ministry said.

On-site quarantine officials had ordered the culling of all 81 head
of milk cows on the farm as a preventive measure while cloven-hoofed
livestock within a 500 meter radius of the outbreak are being
slaughtered and buried to contain the spread of the highly contagious disease.

The latest case is the 5th FMD cased confirmed in the Pocheon region,
located about 45km [28 miles] from Seoul. One other case was
confirmed in nearby Yeoncheon, 62 km [38.5 miles] north of Seoul. It
is also the 1st outbreak to be reported in the country since 18 Jan 2010.

The animal disease affects all cloven-hoofed animals such as cattle,
hogs, goats and deers causing blisters on the feet and mouths of
livestock and sometimes leading to death. It can be spread via air,
feed and imported farm products that have not been sterilized.
Humans, though not affected by the disease, can be [mechanical] carriers.

South Korea was hit twice before by the FMD disease in 2000 and 2002.
Losses from the 2000 outbreak centered on cattle and reached 300.6
billion won (USD 259.8 million), while the 2002 outbreak cost 143.4
billion won as the disease spread through pigs. The government
declined to give the exact size of damages incurred in the latest
outbreak, although over 3500 cows, pigs, goats, deers have been culled so far.
