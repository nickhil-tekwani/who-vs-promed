A disease that threatens to wipe out the wild population of Tasmanian
devils has triggered an abrupt change in their breeding habits, a study shows.

Devil facial tumour disease (DFTD) has led to the animals mating at an
unusually young age and females having just one litter, say scientists. The
observed changes in the creatures' life cycle could affect the chances of
saving the iconic species, they added. The findings appear in the
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
(<http://intl.pnas.org/content/early/2008/07/07/0711236105.abstract>).

A team of Australian scientists said they believed it to be the 1st known
case of an infectious disease leading to increased early reproduction in a
species of mammal. The researchers, led by Dr Menna Jones from the
University of Tasmania, analyzed data from 5 sites where devil
(_Sarcophilus harrisii_) populations had been studied before and after the
arrival of the disease. "Devils have shown their capacity to respond to
this disease-induced increased adult mortality with a 16-fold increase in
the proportion of individuals exhibiting precocious sexual maturity," they
reported.

Devil dynamics
--------------
At all 5 sites, DFTD had significantly changed the age structure of the
devil populations. The team noted that before the arrival of the disease,
there was a much higher proportion of adults more than 3 years old.

They also observed that the disease appeared to influence the number of
litters female devils produced. Before the emergence of DFTD at one of the
sites, the Freycinet Peninsula on the east coast of the island, a typical
female began breeding aged 2, and went on to produce annual litters for 3
years, before dying in its 5th or 6th year.

"Females now generally have one breeding opportunity and may not survive
long enough to rear that litter. Hence they are now largely semelparous
[breed only once]."

Symptoms of DFTD were first reported in 1996, and by 2007 the disease had
spread to more than half of the species' range on Tasmania.

The cause of the disease, which first appears as lumps or lesions around
the mouth, is unknown. There are no historical records describing
disfigured devils; although cancer was normal in the creatures, it was
usually internal.

There are a number of theories explaining the rapid emergence of the
disease, including pesticides, population dynamics, and a dormant virus in
the animals. "This consistently fatal disease is an infectious cancer...
with tumour cells spread directly between devils biting," the researchers
explained. "Evidence shows that most penetrating biting injuries occur
among adult males and females in the mating season."

Populations in areas where the disease has spread have experienced declines
of up to 89 per cent, with the tumours primarily affecting adults aged 2 or
more, killing the animal within 5 months of manifestation.

The team suggested that the disease may be frequency-dependent, meaning
that it did not disappear even when the number of hosts fell to very low
levels. As a result, they added, there were concerns that the world's
largest carnivorous marsupial could become extinct in the wild within 20-25
years. "This novel disease could have catastrophic consequences for the
Tasmanian devil," they warned.

Devil facts
----------
Average weight: males 11 kg (24 lb), females 7 kg (15 lb)
Jaws are more powerful than a tiger's
Opportunistic feeders, not specialized predators
Can smell food for up to 1 km (0.6 mi) away
Devils have at least 11 distinct vocal calls
Became "devils" in 1803 when sailors reported "unearthly" calls

the tumor pressures are causing earlier breeding and earlier deaths, there
is no report that indicates what is being done to develop a vaccine or a
treatment. If this cancer is associated with a virus, then a vaccine should
be possible. On the other hand, if the animals could develop immunity it
would be preferable, but at the apparent rate of deaths, that does not seem
to be happening. - Mod.TG
