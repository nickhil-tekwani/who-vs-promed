A mumps outbreak has been identified among university students in
Adelaide. The highly infectious disease has been diagnosed in at
least 8 students in the past 2 weeks, with more cases likely. All
lived in the same student accommodation, which houses about 180
people. Health authorities have advised the unidentified university
on isolating those affected and have offered mumps vaccine to all
unvaccinated residents.
Mumps in adults is an uncommon condition which in rare cases can lead
to meningitis, hearing loss and sterility. Health Department acting
chief medical officer Professor Paddy Phillips said the disease could
take up to 3 weeks to become evident after being exposed. "I wouldn't
be a bit surprised if there were more cases, because it's got such a
long incubation period," he said yesterday [30 Oct 2007]. Most of
those affected have been overseas students aged 18 to 24.
Symptoms include swelling of the sides of the face and jaw line.
Inflammation of the testicles occurs in about 20 per cent of adult
male cases and inflammation of the ovaries in 5 per cent of adult
females. Almost 1/3rd of people will have mild or no symptoms but
will still be infectious. These apparently well students could be
infecting others who will not show signs of the disease for a
fortnight or more.
Professor Phillips said none of the ill students had required
hospital treatment. "That's a quite uncommon complication," he said.
"Most people have a self-limited, slightly unpleasant illness, no
residual effects." He said many were not fully protected because they
received only one of the required 2 courses of vaccine in childhood.
Although more than 50 doses of vaccine had since been administered to
students, it will take weeks for them to develop immunity. SA has
recorded 11 mumps cases this year [2007], compared with 20 for all of
last year. Before a vaccine was introduced in the early 1980s, it was
normal for most of the population to acquire the virus. Treatment for
those affected includes paracetamol for pain and fever and isolation
until 9 days after symptoms disappear.

[This outbreak has similarity to an outbreak in Canada earlier in the
year, when mumps was disseminated among students across Canada from a
university in Nova Scotia (see references below). Again in Adelaide
Australia, introduction of infection by overseas students has
revealed deficiencies in the vaccine status of a considerable number
of young students. It is to be hoped that the measures taken will be
sufficient to contain the outbreak to the student population of
Adelaide. - Mod.CP]
