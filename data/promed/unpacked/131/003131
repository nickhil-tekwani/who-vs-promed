The growing menace of chikungunya [virus] has hit more than 300 people and
has claimed one person's life in Annechakanahalli in Holenarsipur taluk
[administrative division] of Hassan district. The deceased has been
identified as a 55 year old man. But sadly, the taluk health officer claims
that he is unaware of the prevalent situation.

The officer, Dr Rajesh, said that though the menace began almost a month
ago, he was not aware of the attacks in the village. While clarifying that
he yet hasn't received any complaint with this regard, he notified that he
got to know about this only on Friday [30 Apr 2010] and he had directed Dr
Sidde Gowda to visit the village on Saturday [1 May 2010]. However, Dr
Sidde Gowda said he had treated all the cases.

The village comes under the Doddakadanuru Primary Health Centre (PHC). The
inhabitants of the village stated that they had visited Doddakadanuru PHC
sometime ago, to report the symptoms of chikungunya [virus infection], but
the medical officer didn't respond to them in a proper manner. Now, the
disease has engulfed the whole village, just within a month.

A resident said chikungunya has affected him and 3 others in his family. He
said that the doctors did not bother to visit the village even after they
were informed about the death of the man a week ago, due to chikungunya.
[Another man] said that in his house 3 persons were down with chikungunya.
Another villager said that since one month, he was taking several people
from the village to the Doddakadanuru PHC for treatment.

When contacted, district health officer Thimmappa said that on Friday [30
Apr 2010], Zilla Panchayat chief executive officer MR Balakrishna convened
a meeting in this regard and sent medicines to the village.

[It is not clear if any of these cases, and especially the fatality, have
been laboratory confirmed. Fatalities from chikungunya virus infection are
extremely rare. Chikungunya and dengue virus infections are not easily
distinguished from each other, especially by the lay public, in the absence
of laboratory tests. No mention is made in this report of acute arthralgia,
which would suggest chikungunya virus infection. Chikungunya virus
continues to circulate in India over the past year, including in Karnataka
state.
