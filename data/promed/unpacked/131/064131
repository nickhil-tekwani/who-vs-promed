The Memphis Commercial Appeal reported this week that a "highly contagious
and rapidly growing strain" of tuberculosis unexpectedly emerged in 1994
along the Tennessee-Kentucky border in the foothills of the Great Smoky
Mountains. In a 2-year period there were 21 cases of the more virulent
form of the disease, and 337 positive skin tests in asymptomatic persons.
"This is something we haven't seen before. The lab people have no record of
any TB bug growing like this one," CDC spokesperson Sarah Valway told the
New York Times. She said that in laboratory tests the strain multiplies one
thousand times faster than a typical TB bacterium [this is actually
impossible; what she must have said is that it multiplies to a 1000-fold
higher titer - Mod.JW].
However, the strain has not become resistant to antibiotics.
The medical director of the Lake Cumberland District Health Department in
Somerset, Kentucky, Christine Weyman, said that the number of recent cases
had diminished. "Right now, we're on a plateau ... I hope and pray it's
past its peak."
The center of the outbreak has been Picket County in north central Tennessee
and Clinton County in south central Kentucky.
