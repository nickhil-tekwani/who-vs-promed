The [Nebraska] Central District Health Department [CDHD] reported [Wed 20 Nov 2019], a multi-state outbreak of hepatitis A that has been linked to eating blackberries and potentially to strawberries purchased at Fresh Thyme grocery stores. The berries were distributed in 3 states [I believe they mean cases have occurred in these states - Mod.LL], including Nebraska as well as Indiana and Wisconsin. The department noted that these same berries were also distributed in Iowa, Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, Minnesota, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.

"The strawberries and blackberries would have been purchased at Fresh Thyme grocery stores between 9 and 30 Sep 2019. If you didn't freeze these berries you probably won't have any left. However, if you purchased and froze berries during this time period, either throw them out or return them for a refund," said Teresa Anderson, Health Director.

Hepatitis A is a contagious liver infection caused by the hepatitis A virus and can range from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a severe illness lasting several months. Hepatitis A can cause death in some people but is rare. Hepatitis A usually spreads when a person unknowingly ingests the virus from objects, food, or drinks contaminated by small, undetected amounts of stool from an infected person, according to officials. Symptoms begin somewhere between 2 and 7 weeks after exposure. Individuals are considered most contagious during the 2 weeks before and one week after onset of symptoms. Officials said those diagnosed with hepatitis A or persons symptomatic after a known exposure should not work or prepare food for one week after symptoms begin and until symptoms are gone for longer than 24 hours.

"We continue to work with CDC and FDA officials in this investigation and will advise the public of any updates. "If you have any questions about potential exposure to hepatitis A, call your health professional or call us at CDHD. If you were recently exposed to hepatitis A virus and have not been vaccinated against hepatitis A, you might benefit from an injection of either hepatitis A vaccine or immune globulin. Your health provider can help you decide what is best based on your age," Anderson added.

Fresh Thyme Farmers Market released the following statement to NTV on [Wed 20 Nov 2019]:

"The Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control, in conjunction with other state and local agencies, have contacted us concerning a recent hepatitis A outbreak in 3 states in the Midwest affecting an unspecified number of individuals. These agencies are investigating and believe that affected people may have consumed fresh conventional (non-organic) blackberries between [9 and 30 Sep 2019]. We are fully cooperating with these agencies on the investigation and are awaiting next steps.

"At this time, there is no reason to believe that any of the product was contaminated via handling in our stores. In addition, the agencies are ONLY concerned with product purchased between [9 and 30 Sep 2019]; product purchased or consumed outside of these dates are NOT subject to the investigation. We are working with these agencies to identify our suppliers and isolate the source of this contamination. Fresh Thyme takes the health and safety of our customers and our team members very seriously. Fresh Thyme Farmers Market has a stringent process for ensuring compliance to all local, state and federal health and hygiene regulations.

"Should any customers have any of the fresh conventional blackberries purchased between [9 and 30 Sep 2019], remaining in their refrigerators or freezers, they should be discarded immediately or returned to Fresh Thyme for a refund. In Douglas County, NE, if you purchased any of these berries between [9 and 30 Sep 2019], and still have them, please take them to the local health department for testing.

"Again, Fresh Thyme is committed to the health and safety of our customers, and we will continue to work closely with these agencies to determine the source of the contamination."

[Most of the hepatitis A outbreaks associated with berries have been related to frozen ones. The source of the berries is not stated. It would be interesting to know if the berries originated in one of the states in the USA with ongoing outbreaks of HAV and if the strain analysis matches the outbreak strain in those states. - Mod.LL
