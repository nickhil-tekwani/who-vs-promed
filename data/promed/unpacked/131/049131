From: Jack Woodall <promed@usa.healthnet.org>

In the course of being interviewed about this outbreak by a journalist for
the Brazilian newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo today, I learned two things:
- since the beginning of September, Brazilian airlines have been spraying
all inbound flights from New York with insecticide before landing, to kill
any possibly infected mosquitoes on board;
- there is concern that, with the fall migration just beginning, birds
flying south from New York state could bring the virus with them to South
America.
Although WNV is know to produce a long-lasting viremia, my feeling is that
passerine birds take so long to reach South America (a week or more) that
they will either have died of the virus en route or will have cleared the
virus from their blood-stream before they arrive here, and so will be unable
to infect local mosquitoes. Faster-flying species such as swallows have
not, so far, been implicated as WNV hosts. But while this may hold for
Brazil, it is possible that birds flying south from New York state could
infect mosquitoes in more southerly states of the USA.
Would any knowledgeable ornithologist care to comment?
