=95Sustained Transmission of Nosocomial Legionnaires Disease - Arizona and
Ohio:
In 1996, two hospitals reported sustained transmission of nosocomial
Legionnaires disease (LD). The hot water distribution systems in each
hospital were implicated as the sources of infection. This report
summarizes investigations in these two hospitals by hospital personnel,
state and local health officials, and CDC and efforts to control
transmission.
MMWR Editorial Note: The findings in these and other recent
investigations indicate the capacity for legionellae to colonize
hospital plumbing systems for long periods and, in the absence of
effective preventive measures, to represent an ongoing risk for
infection. Colonization rates are higher in large hospitals with older,
large hot-water tanks in which water is held at lower temperatures.
Hospital X served a large bone marrow and organ transplant patient
population, and nosocomial legionellae transmission resulted in
substantial morbidity and mortality during at least a 17-year period in
this group of immunocompromised patients. Standard respiratory disease
infection-control measures (high efficiency particulate air filtered
positive-pressure rooms, patient use of surgical masks while out of the
room, and use of sterile water in respiratory therapy equipment) were
insufficient to prevent transmission within hospital X.
At hospital Y, long-term interruption of transmission had not been achieved
since recognition of legionellae transmission in 1977, despite use of a
variety of strategies including hyperchlorination, thermal disinfection, and
metal ionization. In addition, incomplete plumbing system records resulted
in delayed treatment of appropriate potable water systems...
L. pneumophila and other legionellae requires culture, paired serum
antibody titers, or direct fluorescent antibody testing for diagnosis.
The decision to initiate an environmental investigation should consider
both the type of patient population exposed and the level of risk for
nosocomial transmission. Routine culturing of potable hospital water has
been advocated even in the absence of identified LD transmission;
however, additional data are needed to define the relation between water
culture results and risk for disease.
Legionellae are found in natural and man-made aquatic environments, but
growth to high concentrations occurs most often at water temperatures of
77 F-108 F (25 C- 42 C). Concern about the risk for scalding injuries
has prompted some jurisdictions to regulate temperatures in hospital hot
water systems at levels conducive to legionellae growth. Additions and
alterations to hospital plumbing systems in response to changing
hospital facility needs may create areas of stagnation and sediment
buildup, factors also shown to enhance legionellae colonization. These
stagnant areas may be resistant to chlorination, thermal disinfection,
and ionization. Respiratory therapy equipment should be rinsed only with
sterile (not distilled) water. When water distribution systems are
suspected as the source of nosocomial LD, patient exposure to potable
water aerosols and ingestion of potable water should be minimized.
Standard decontamination procedures for potable hot water systems
include thermal disinfection and hyperchlorination.
Because eradication of legionellae from water distribution systems
generally is not possible, a maintenance program to minimize regrowth of
legionellae should also be implemented. Raising the water temperature to
120 F-125 F (49 C-52 C) at the fixture (although higher temperatures may
increase the risk of scalding) and infusion of chlorine to maintain
consistent levels of 1-2 mg/L have been employed to achieve long-term
decontamination in many hospitals. Although metal ionization systems may
be effective, whether they offer an advantage over conventional methods
is unclear; in hospital Y, nosocomial transmission persisted after
installation of an ionization system. Detailed guidelines on the
prevention of nosocomial LD, including decontamination procedures for
contaminated potable water and cooling systems, have been published and
are available electronically on the World-Wide Web at
