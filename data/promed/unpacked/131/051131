After a male nurse from Jodhpur [Rajasthan state] fell prey to an unidentified virus and died on Sunday night [18 Jan 2015], the 2nd patient, also a male nurse, also succumbed to multiple organ failure on Wednesday morning [21 Jan 2015]. He died 2 days after rushing him to AIIMS, New Delhi. He was said to be suffering from viral hemorrhagic fever caused by an unknown viral infection.

On the other hand, the medical and health department has ordered complete closure of the private hospital in Jodhpur for the fumigation of the entire building and has taken samples from the ICU. "We have ordered a complete closure of one part of the hospital building and have got the ICU sampling done by a team of microbiology laboratory from S N Medical College," said CMHO Yuddhveer Singh.

Also, 2 other patients, male nurses in the same hospital, have been diagnosed for dengue. [One of them] is undergoing treatment at Apollo Hospital in Ahmedabad [Gujarat state]. "We contacted both of them and checked their medical reports. Both of them have been diagnosed for dengue and both are recovering fast due to a proper treatment," Singh confirmed.

All of these patients were serving as the male nurse at the ICU of a private hospital here. [Samples of one of the fatal cases] viscera has been sent to the National Institute of Virology, Pune.

On the insistence of relatives, the [2nd case] was rushed to AIIMS by air ambulance by the hospital administration. But he also succumbed to the unidentified viral infection on Wednesday [21 Jan 2015]. Both the deceased have not reported as infected with the dengue virus.

The hospital administration, however, has refused [denied?] any viral infection [occurred] in the hospital but according to Singh, the cause of the deaths could only be found after the receipt of the detailed reports from Pune and AIIMS respectively.

Meanwhile, the Private Hospital Nursing Association, which organized a tribute at the main gate of the hospital on Wednesday afternoon, has demanded compensation from the hospital administration.

Terming it to be either some vector borne disease or a dengue like virus, director of the hospital, Anand Goyal, said the proposal would definitely be considered on humanitarian ground as both of them were their long serving employees. "It is our duty to look after their families," Goyal said.

[Until the results of the laboratory tests become available, it is difficult to suggest which etiological agent might be involved in these fatal cases. Apparently, dengue hemorrhagic fever has been ruled out. The report indicated that a virus was responsible, but no details are given to substantiate that diagnosis. However, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus is a likely candidate. Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) is unlikely because Rajasthan is in northwestern India and KFD occurs in the southeast. Although ProMED has not reported CCHF cases previously in Rajasthan, cases have occurred recently in Gujarat state, which is to the immediate south of Rajasthan state. As noted in comments in ProMED-mail archive no. 20141124.2986269 and in the report above, CCHF has been an ongoing public health problem in Gujarat state over the past 3 years. Studies have shown that there is relatively high antibody prevalence in domestic animals in this area. A published study cited in ProMED-mail archive no. 20140920.2790245 stated: "This disease is asymptomatic in animals. CCHF was 1st confirmed in a nosocomial outbreak in 2011 in Gujarat State. Another notifiable outbreak occurred in July 2013, in Karyana Village, Amreli district, Gujarat State. Anti-CCHF virus (CCHFV) immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were detected in domestic animals from the adjoining villages of the affected area, indicating a considerable amount of positivity in domestic animals. Antibodies were detected in all the 15 districts surveyed; with positivity of 12 per cent, 41 per cent, and 34 per cent in bovines, sheep, and goats, respectively."

As Mod.CP noted (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20100810.2732), CCHF virus is tick-borne, and in the genus _Nairovirus_, family _Bunyaviridae_. The virus can cause severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent. The virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp. ticks or through contact with infected human blood or animal blood and tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Exposure in health care facilities also occurs, as was the likely situation in these 2 cases. The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days.

If these turn out to be CCHF infections, fatalities among medical staff in the hospitals indicate that barrier nursing and personal protection have not been adequate. Usually, humans acquire the infection from the bite of a _Hyalomma_ tick or from direct contact with blood or tissues of infected animals. ProMED would appreciate receiving the results of the laboratory tests as soon as they become available.
