Abstract
Bagaza virus (BAGV) has not been reported in birds in South Africa since 1978. We used phylogenetic analysis and electron microscopy to identify BAGV as the likely etiology in neurologic disease and death in Himalayan monal pheasants in Pretoria, South Africa. Our results suggest circulation of BAGV in South Africa.

[According to the paper, all affected birds were adults that were locally bred from parents imported from Belgium more than 2 years before. The mentioned previous report on BAGV in birds in South Africa, in 1978, addressed an outbreak of meningoencephalitis in turkeys (Ref 1). Its summary follows:

"Turkey meningo-encephalitis is a neuroparalytic disease of turkeys 1st described and shown to be caused by a flavivirus in Israel. During 1978, a similar disease was observed in South Africa. In addition to the lesions described in Israel, myocarditis, regression of the ovary, and egg peritonitis were constant findings. The similarity in host range, symptoms, and pathological changes produced by the virus isolated locally and in Israel and the serological cross-reaction between the 2 virus isolates indicate that they are identical."

The 1960 turkey meningoencephalitis (TME) event in Israel was described as a neuroparalytic disease that, under field conditions, affected birds older than 10 weeks (Ref 2). This flavivirus, coined TME, continued its periodic recurrences, with a seasonal pattern, ever since. In 2003, studies of its transmission by several vectors in Israel, including mosquitoes, were reported (Ref 3).

BAGV was initially isolated in 1966 from mosquitoes in Bagaza, Central African Republic, and later from mosquitoes in other Western African countries, as well as in India. In 2010, BAGV emerged for the 1st time in Europe, causing an outbreak in game birds in southern Spain with high mortality rates in partridges and pheasants (Ref 4). In 2014, TMEV was suggested to be identical with Bagaza virus (BAGV); the authors proposed that both viruses be designated by a new unified name: Avian meningoencephalomyelitis virus (Ref 5).

Recently, countrywide outbreak of TME has been reported from Israel, affecting commercial turkey farms (ProMED-mail archive no. 20191025.6746703). Reportedly, at least 8 farms have been affected, the age of affected flocks being 14 weeks and older. The diagnostic technique applied is described in Ref 6. - Mod.AS
