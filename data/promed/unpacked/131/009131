The patient has fully recovered from his illness with resolution of
his acute renal failure. No other cases have occurred as far as I
know.

The organism was confirmed to be _Vibrio cholerae_ by both the New
York City and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention labs. It was
non-O1, non-O139 and also did not agglutinate using the other O
antigen testing available at CDC, O141 and O75. In addition, the
organism was tested by PCR for the presence of cholera toxin gene
(ctxA) and was determined to be negative for this gene, so it was
non-toxigenic for the cholera toxin.

[This patient clinically had cholera, losing more than 10 per cent of
his body weight. Overall, non-O1, non-O139 strains of _V. cholerae_
tend to (but, as in this case, not always) cause milder
gastrointestinal illness and also can have bacteremic, non-diarrhea
presentations.

In almost all cases, non-O1, non-O139 _V. cholerae_ isolates do not
possess the genes for either cholera toxin or the toxin-coregulated
pilus (TCP). Yet, some isolates can cause substantial diarrhea (1-4).
The type III secretion system (TTSS) is a mechanism for Gram negative
bacilli to introduce effector proteins into host cell cytoplasm (5).
Recently, it has been reported that a functional TTSS is required for
at least some non-O1, non-O139 isolates to induce diarrhea in an
animal model associated with small bowel damage and production of
proinflammatory cytokines (6). In addition, TTSS contributes to
virulence even in the presence of cholera toxin and TCP (6).
