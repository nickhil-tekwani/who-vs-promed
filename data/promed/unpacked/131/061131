--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Significance
------------
Zika virus (ZIKV) has been identified as a cause of microcephaly. However, the mechanisms by which ZIKV disrupts neurogenesis and causes microcephaly remains poorly understood. Here, we first report that ZIKV exposure causes neural progenitor cell pyroptosis, mediated by activation of caspase-1 and gasdermin D in vivo as well as in vitro, which links ZIKV to the development and progression of microcephaly. Consistent with this notion, caspase-1 deletion or treatment with caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765 reduced ZIKV-induced inflammatory responses and pyroptosis, and robustly attenuated neuropathy and brain atrophy. Taken together, our findings provide unique perspectives on ZIKV-associated neuropathogenesis and potentially clinically applicable options for its treatment.

Abstract
--------
Mounting evidence has associated Zika virus (ZIKV) infection with congenital malformations, including microcephaly, which raises global alarm. Nonetheless, mechanisms by which ZIKV disrupts neurogenesis and causes microcephaly are far from being understood. In this study, we discovered direct effects of ZIKV on neural progenitor cell development by inducing caspase-1- and gasdermin D (GSDMD)-mediated pyroptotic cell death, linking ZIKV infection with the development of microcephaly. Importantly, caspase-1 depletion or its inhibitor VX-765 treatment reduced ZIKV-induced inflammatory responses and pyroptosis, and substantially attenuated neuropathology and brain atrophy in vivo. Collectively, our data identify caspase-1- and GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis in neural progenitor cells as a previously unrecognized mechanism for ZIKV-related pathological effects during neural development, and also provide treatment options for ZIKV-associated diseases.

How Zika affects the extracellular matrix
-----------------------------------------
In some cases, Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy leads to a series of severe defects in the fetus collectively known as congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). These include microcephaly, defective neuronal migration, and impaired cortical development. Aguiar et al. combined genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic analyses of blood and postmortem brains and demonstrated that ZIKV-infected neonates showed a reduction in collagen expression and an increase in adhesion factor expression, alterations in the extracellular matrix consistent with the brain defects seen in CZS. Together, these datasets form a useful resource for those investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying CZS in humans.

Abstract
--------
Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy can cause a set of severe abnormalities in the fetus known as congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). Experiments with animal models and in vitro systems have substantially contributed to our understanding of the pathophysiology of ZIKV infection. Here, to investigate the molecular basis of CZS in humans, we used a systems biology approach to integrate transcriptomic, proteomic, and genomic data from the postmortem brains of neonates with CZS. We observed that collagens were greatly reduced in expression in CZS brains at both the RNA and protein levels and that neonates with CZS had several single-nucleotide polymorphisms in collagen-encoding genes that are associated with osteogenesis imperfecta and arthrogryposis. These findings were validated by immunohistochemistry and comparative analysis of collagen abundance in ZIKV-infected and uninfected samples. In addition, we showed a ZIKV-dependent increase in the expression of cell adhesion factors that are essential for neurite outgrowth and axon guidance, findings that are consistent with the neuronal migration defects observed in CZS. Together, these findings provide insights into the underlying molecular alterations in the ZIKV-infected brain and reveal host genes associated with CZS susceptibility.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
Background
Since 2015, the arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) Zika and chikungunya have spread across the Americas causing outbreaks, accompanied by increases in immune-mediated and infectious neurological disease. The spectrum of neurological manifestations linked to these viruses, and the importance of dual infection, are not known fully. We aimed to investigate whether neurological presentations differed according to the infecting arbovirus and whether patients with dual infection had a different disease spectrum or severity.

Methods
We report a prospective observational study done during epidemics of Zika and chikungunya viruses in Recife, Pernambuco, a dengue-endemic area of Brazil. We recruited adults aged 18 years or older referred to Hospital da Restauracao, a secondary-level and tertiary-level hospital, with suspected acute neurological disease and a history of suspected arboviral infection. We looked for evidence of Zika, chikungunya, or dengue infection by viral RNA or specific IgM antibodies in serum or CSF. We grouped patients according to their arbovirus laboratory diagnosis and then compared demographic and clinical characteristics.

Findings
Between 4 Dec 2014 and 4 Dec 2016, 1410 patients were admitted to the hospital neurology service; 201 (14%) had symptoms consistent with arbovirus infection and sufficient samples for diagnostic testing and were included in the study. The median age was 48 years (IQR 34-60), and 106 (53%) were women. 148 (74%) of 201 patients had laboratory evidence of arboviral infection. 98 (49%) of them had a single viral infection (41 [20%] had Zika, 55 [27%] had chikungunya, and 2 [1%] had dengue infection), whereas 50 (25%) had evidence of dual infection, mostly with Zika and chikungunya viruses (46 [23%] patients). Patients positive for arbovirus infection presented with a broad range of CNS and peripheral nervous system (PNS) disease. Chikungunya infection was more often associated with CNS disease (26 [47%] of 55 patients with chikungunya infection vs 6 [15%] of 41 with Zika infection; p=0.0008), especially myelitis (12 [22%] patients). Zika infection was more often associated with PNS disease (26 [63%] of 41 patients with Zika infection vs 9 [16%] of 55 with chikungunya infection; p less than or equal to 0.0001), particularly Guillain-Barre syndrome (25 [61%] patients). Patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome who had Zika and chikungunya dual infection had more aggressive disease, requiring intensive care support and longer hospital stays, than those with mono-infection (median 24 days [IQR 20-30] vs 17 days [10-20]; p=0.0028); 8 (17%) of 46 patients with Zika and chikungunya dual infection had a stroke or transient ischaemic attack, compared with 5 (6%) of 96 patients with Zika or chikungunya mono-infection (p=0.047).

Interpretation
There is a wide and overlapping spectrum of neurological manifestations caused by Zika or chikungunya mono-infection and by dual infections. The possible increased risk of acute cerebrovascular disease in patients with dual infection merits further investigation.

[Interestingly, a 21 Oct 2020 article published in Viruses (https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/10/1201/htm) reported 6 cases of Zika/dengue virus coinfection among a cohort of 2017 participants in Brazil. The clinical outcomes were suggestive for both DENV and ZIKV infection. No coinfected patient had neurological clinical manifestation, warning signs, or need for hospitalization.

The report above indicates that Zika/chikungunya virus coinfections that were studied were more serious because of neurological complications than the 6 Zika/dengue virus infections that had no reported neurological consequences. - Mod.TY]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Zika virus epidemics have potential large-scale population effects. Controlled studies of mice and nonhuman primates indicate that Zika affects fecundity, raising concerns about miscarriage in human populations. In regions of Brazil, Zika risk peaked months before residents learned about the epidemic and its relation to congenital anomalies. This spatiotemporal variation supports analysis of both biological effects of Zika infection on fertility and the effects of learning about Zika risk on reproductive behavior. Causal inference techniques used with vital statistics indicate that the epidemic caused reductions in birth cohort size of approximately 1/4, 18 months after Zika infection risk peaked but 10 months after public health messages advocated childbearing delay. The evidence is consistent with small but not statistically detectable biological reductions in fecundity, as well as large strategic changes in reproductive behavior to temporally align childbearing with reduced risk to infant health. The behavioral effects are larger for more-educated and older women, which may reflect facilitated access to information and to family planning services within high-risk, mosquito-infested urban locations as well as perceptions about the opportunity costs of risks to pregnancy and infant survival.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Several hundred thousand Zika cases have been reported across the Americas since 2015. Incidence of infection was likely much higher, however, due to a high frequency of asymptomatic infection and other challenges that surveillance systems faced. Using a hierarchical Bayesian model with empirically-informed priors, we leveraged multiple types of Zika case data from 15 countries to estimate subnational reporting probabilities and infection attack rates (IARs). Zika IAR estimates ranged from 0.084 (95% CrI [credible interval]: 0.067-0.096) in Peru to 0.361 (95% CrI: 0.214-0.514) in Ecuador, with significant subnational variability in every country. Totaling infection estimates across these and 33 other countries and territories, our results suggest that 132.3 million (95% CrI: 111.3-170.2 million) people in the Americas had been infected by the end of 2018. These estimates represent the most extensive attempt to determine the size of the Zika epidemic in the Americas, offering a baseline for assessing the risk of future Zika epidemics in this region.

Author summary
--------------
During the recent Zika epidemic in the Americas millions of people were likely infected, but the true size of the epidemic is unknown because of gaps in the surveillance system. The infection attack rate (IAR) -- defined as the proportion of the population that was infected over the course of the epidemic -- has important implications for the longer-term epidemiology of Zika in the region, such as the timing, location, and likelihood of future outbreaks. To estimate the IAR and the total number of people infected, we leveraged multiple types of Zika case data from 15 countries and territories where subnational data were publicly available. Datasets included confirmed and suspected Zika cases in pregnant women and in the total population, Zika-associated Guillain-Barre syndrome cases, and cases of congenital Zika syndrome. We used a hierarchical Bayesian model with empirically-informed priors that leveraged the different case report types to simultaneously estimate national and subnational reporting probabilities, the fraction of symptomatic infections, and subnational IARs. In these 15 countries and territories, estimates of Zika IAR ranged from 0.084 (95% CrI: 0.067-0.096) in Peru to 0.361 (95% CrI: 0.214-0.514) in Ecuador. Totaling these infection estimates across these and 33 other countries and territories in the region, our results suggest that 132.3 million (95% CrI: 111.3-170.2 million) people in the Americas were infected with ZIKV by the end of 2018.

[Estimating the number of infected individuals is challenging in the outbreak where 80% of those infected with the virus are asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms that make it unlikely that they would seek medical attention. The approach above provides such an estimate of previously infected individuals, the proportion that they make up of the total population, and the proportion uninfected and hence, susceptible to future infection. - Mod.TY]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses share similar disease features, rendering them difficult to distinguish clinically. Incapacitating arthralgia/arthritis is a specific manifestation associated with chikungunya virus infection. However, the profile of arthralgia/arthritis in Zika virus (ZIKV) cases has not been well characterized. Articles were extracted from PubMed and Scopus databases reporting original data from patients with arthralgia/arthritis, according to the Cochrane Collaboration. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, 137 articles reporting ZIKV-associated joint symptoms were reviewed. Arthralgia was more frequently reported (n=124 from case studies, n=1779 from population-based studies) than arthritis (n=7 and n=121, respectively). Arthralgia was resolved in less than 1 week in 54%, and within 1-2 weeks in 40% of cases. The meta-analysis of cases in population-based studies identified a pooled prevalence of 53.55% for arthralgia. The pooled prevalence of arthralgia/arthritis during outbreaks depended on the geographic location, with a higher joint symptom burden observed in the Americas compared to South East Asia (Brazil: 60.79%; Puerto Rico: 68.89% and South East Asia: 26.46%). We conclude that non-specific constitutional arthralgia is the most common joint manifestation during ZIKV infection, being present in nearly half of cases but resolving by 2 weeks in more than 90% of these. We found no evidence of chronic rheumatic manifestations following ZIKV infection.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
KPNA2/importin-alpha1 (karyopherin subunit alpha 2) is the primary nucleocytoplasmic transporter for some transcription factors to activate cellular proliferation and differentiation. Aberrant increase of KPNA2 level is identified as a prognostic marker in a variety of cancers. Yet, the turnover mechanism of KPNA2 remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that KPNA2 is degraded via the chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) and that Zika virus (ZIKV) enhances the KPNA2 degradation. KPNA2 contains a CMA motif, which possesses an indispensable residue Gln109 for the CMA-mediated degradation. RNAi-mediated knockdown of LAMP2A, a vital component of the CMA pathway, led to a higher level of KPNA2. Moreover, ZIKV reduced KPNA2 via the viral NS2A protein, which contains an essential residue Thr100 for inducing the CMA-mediated KPNA2 degradation. Notably, mutant ZIKV with T100A alteration in NS2A replicates much weaker than the wild-type virus. Also, knockdown of KPNA2 led to a higher ZIKV viral yield, which indicates that KPNA2 mediates certain antiviral effects. These data provide insights into the KPNA2 turnover and the ZIKV-cell interactions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
Background
Prospective studies of Zika virus in pregnancy have reported rates of congenital Zika syndrome and other adverse outcomes by trimester. However, Zika virus can infect and damage the fetus early in utero, but clear before delivery. The true vertical transmission rate is therefore unknown. We aimed to provide the 1st estimates of underlying vertical transmission rates and adverse outcomes due to congenital infection with Zika virus by trimester of exposure.

Methods
This was a Bayesian latent class analysis of data from 7 prospective studies of Zika virus in pregnancy. We estimated vertical transmission rates, rates of Zika-virus-related and non-Zika-virus-related adverse outcomes, and the diagnostic sensitivity of markers of congenital infection. We allowed for variation between studies in these parameters and used information from women in comparison groups with no PCR-confirmed infection, where available.

Findings
The estimated mean risk of vertical transmission was 47% (95% credible interval 26 to 76) following maternal infection in the 1st trimester, 28% (15 to 46) in the 2nd, and 25% (13 to 47) in the 3rd. 9% (4 to 17) of deliveries following infections in the 1st trimester had symptoms consistent with congenital Zika syndrome, 3% (1 to 7) in the 2nd, and 1% (0 to 3) in the 3rd. We estimated that in infections during the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd trimester, respectively, 13% (2 to 27), 3% (-5 to 14), and 0% (-7 to 11) of pregnancies had adverse outcomes attributable to Zika virus infection. Diagnostic sensitivity of markers of congenital infection was lowest in the 1st trimester (42% [18 to 72]) but increased to 85% (51 to 99) in trimester 2, and 80% (42 to 99) in trimester 3. There was substantial between-study variation in the risks of vertical transmission and congenital Zika syndrome.

Interpretation
This preliminary analysis recovers the causal effects of Zika virus from disparate study designs. Higher transmission in the 1st trimester is unusual with congenital infections but accords with laboratory evidence of decreasing susceptibility of placental cells to infection during pregnancy.

[Accruing reliable quantitative data for in utero teratogenic effects under conditions of an outbreak is difficult, especially if the diagnostic tests employed vary. The study above indicates that the risk of vertical transmission is higher than previously thought, but is in agreement with previous studies that indicated that there is higher transmission during the 1st trimester of pregnancy. - Mod.TY]
