Vermont Health Department is investigating a cluster of patients who tested positive for Legionnaires' disease. A total of 5 patients who live in Franklin or Grand Isle counties tested positive for _Legionella_ in August [2022]. Health officials say there is no known common source of exposure among the 5 patients, although all of them spent time in Franklin County during their incubation periods.

Legionnaires' disease is a bacterial pneumonia spread by inhaling droplets of contaminated water. It can be fatal. Signs and symptoms can include cough, shortness of breath, muscle aches, headache, and fever. Most people get sick within 10 days of exposure, though the incubation period can be as long as 14 days.

Back in 1977, just one year after the bacteria was first discovered, there was a major outbreak of Legionnaires' disease at what was then called the Medical Center Hospital in Burlington. More than 50 people were sickened and 17 died. The outbreak was traced back to the air conditioning system on the hospital campus.

[Grand Isle and Franklin counties are 2 adjacent counties in northwestern portion of the US state of Vermont, bordering New York State (USA) to the west and the province of Quebec (Canada) to the north (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Isle_County,_Vermont and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_County,_Vermont). Four of Grand Isle's 5 towns are located entirely on islands in Lake Champlain, to the west of Franklin County. A map showing the locations of Grand Isle and Franklin counties can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Grand+Isle+County,+VT.

For discussions of Legionnaires' disease, please see my moderator's comments in prior ProMED posts: Legionellosis - USA (02): (CA) fatal, RFI 20220313.8701956; Legionellosis - USA (03): (HI) hotel 20220328.8702268; and Legionellosis - Australia: (NS) 20220527.8703505.

We are not told if genotyping of clinical or environmental (water) isolates has been done. Genotyping the isolates of _Legionella_ from patients will help establish whether this is a common source outbreak, if their genotypes match each other. However, if the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping.

Also, if genotyping of _Legionella_ isolated from the water samples, matching the genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_ will identify the environmental source for the individual cases.

More information on this cluster of cases of legionellosis, if available, would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
