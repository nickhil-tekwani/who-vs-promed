Ron St. John's observation on the unauthorized sale of DDT to tobacco
farmers in the Philippines during the 1970s introduces the important issue
of DDT for agriculture versus public health. In November, the director of
a national malaria control program told me that cacao exporters within his
country warned rural families to not allow house spraying for malaria
control because the country's cacao export business was threatened by trace
amounts of DDT in cacao exports. In response to this problem, malaria
control personnel worked with rural populations to explain why houses
should be sprayed; also that cacao should not be stored inside sprayed
houses. I relate this story to show a major disconnect between regulatory
policies and the health/welfare needs of rural populations. National and
international regulations promote the elimination of DDT for agriculture,
the same regulations also discourage use of DDT for malaria control.
Indonesia has a long history of using DDT to control malaria. Historically,
when large numbers of houses were sprayed malaria rates declined, and when
few houses were sprayed malaria rates increased. Indonesia banned the
public health use of DDT in 1992, not because it was damaging human health
or damaging the environment; but because it was being illegally used in
agriculture and was endangering the country's agricultural export business
(Ministry of Health, Indonesia, report presented in New Delhi, 20-24 March
1995).
With international enforcement of residue tolerances, one can understand
why agri-businesses work to eliminate DDT for both agriculture and public
health. However, is the health and welfare of impoverished rural
populations an ethical tradeoff? In part, this moral dilemma exists
because of confusion about the cause of resurgent malaria. Global warming
is only the most recent in a long list of proposed reasons for increasing
malaria, e.g., vector resistance to insecticides, parasite resistance to
antimalarials, sociological perturbations, etc. The role of these
variables as a cause of resurgent malaria is undefined, but the data from
many countries show the causal link between increasing or decreasing
numbers of houses sprayed with DDT and decreasing or increasing numbers of
malaria cases, respectively. For this reason, the progressive decline in
house spray programs is implicit in the global resurgence of malaria.
[NOTE: The term "resurgent malaria" is probably applicable only to trends
in malaria rates for countries that have a history of national malaria
control programs. Countries without such programs are less likely to have
data for defining changes in malaria rates over time.
The causal link between sprayed houses and malaria rates is ignored in the
Global Malaria Control Strategy (GMCS), which de-emphasizes vector control
measures. The GMCS sends a clear and erroneous message to government
programs that DDT is not needed. At different intervals during the last 9
years, Mexico and Ecuador made spectacular use of DDT to control their
resurgent malaria problems. [NOTE: Success was achieved in Mexico in spite
of wide spread DDT resistance in vector populations. The experiences of
Mexico and Ecuador stand in marked contrast to the continuing upward spiral
in numbers of malaria cases in many other countries of the Americas. In
spite of their successes, only these two countries were specifically
criticized for noncompliance with the GMCS in the 1997 PAHO report on the
Status of Malaria in the Americas.
Many malaria control issues require close and objective examination, not
least of which is the GMCS and regulations that block financial aid to
country programs that use DDT for malaria control. As suggested by an
Environmental Protection Agency colleague, there should be "prescription"
use of DDT for public health that imposes some form of government
accountability (by user governments) for its proper use?
