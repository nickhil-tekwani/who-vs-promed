According to the local newspaper the Times of India, 4 10-month-old
babies died within minutes of being administered an anti-measles
vaccine at 2 medical camps in Tamil Nadu state of India on Wednesday
[23 Apr 2008].

3 baby girls died at a center in Pennalurpettai village, about 75
kilometers (47 mi) from Chennai, the capital city of Tamil Nadu. The
4th, a baby boy, died after getting the shot in Venkatapuram village
in Tiruttani town of the state.

After getting the shocking news, the state administration suspended 2
public health nurses as well as the measles immunization program
across the state. Meanwhile, the Indian Health Ministry rushed a team
of experts to the spots. Samples from various batches of the vaccine
allocated to Tamil Nadu have been sent to the Central Research
Institute (CRI) for testing.

Eyewitnesses said the 3 baby girls started frothing at the mouth,
turned blue and died just after they were given the injection. Even
worse was the fact that there was no provision to take the babies to
hospital in case of emergencies. "We did not plan for an ambulance or
medical support," a health official said, adding that it was supposed
to be a routine program of immunization.

At least 10 states, which were to use the measles vaccine produced by
Human Biologicals Institute (Hyderabad) [HBI] in its routine
immunisation programme, have been asked by the Centre to immediately
stop its use.

On Wednesday [23 Apr 2008], 4 infants in Tiruvallur district of Tamil
Nadu died soon after the vaccine was administered to them at a
primary health centre (PHC). Health ministry records show that
besides Tamil Nadu, the vaccine was also sent to Maharashtra,
Rajasthan, Assam, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand,
Madhya Pradesh, and Bihar for use on 9-month-old children. According
to health minister, A Ramadoss, use of 45 lakh [4 500 000] doses of
the measles vaccine made by HBI has been suspended till an inquiry
into its efficacy and safety is completed.

A stockpile of the vaccine, supplied to the ministry by Serum
Institute, will be used across the country till then. Pawan Murti of
the National Polio Surveillance Project, who was sent to Tamil Nadu
on Wednesday [23 Apr 2008] for initial investigations, told The Times
of India (TOI) from Chennai, "It could have been because of a human
error in case nurses at the PHC by mistake mixed the vaccine with
chemical vials of antibiotic, adrenalin, or muscle relaxants, as all
the vials look the same.

It could also have been because the vaccine, after being
reconstituted, was kept out in the open causing bacterial growth and
contamination. The post-mortem reports of the 4 children will come
tomorrow and we will get an idea then." The ministry purchases 350
lakh [35 000 000] doses of the vaccine annually for its immunisation
programme. While 80 percent of its requirement was to be met by Serum
this year [2008], the rest was to come from HBI.

Meanwhile, a team of experts comprising the director general of
health services Dr R K Srivastava, National Institute of Communicable
Diseases director Dr Shiv Lal and officials from the Indian Council
of Medical Research and Drug Controller General of India left for
Chennai on Thursday evening [24 Apr 2008] to investigate the deaths.
They have been asked to give their preliminary assessment report
within a week. Ramadoss told TOI that if the vaccines, which are
being tested at CRI Kasauli, are found to be contaminated and unsafe,
the ministry will immediately blacklist HBI.

Ramadoss, who held an emergency meeting on Thursday [24 Apr 2008],
which was attended by officials from the health ministry, DGHS
[Director General of Health Services], DCGI [Drug Controller General
of India], NICD [National Institute of Communicable Disease], and
ICMR [Indian Council of Medical Research], said, "The vaccines were
tested before they were released to states. So we aren't sure if the
vaccine caused the deaths because the same batch was administered to
other children. However, if found contaminated, we will waste no time
in suspending further orders. We allowed HBI to supply us with the
vaccine because it was a PSU [Public sector undertakings of India]."
Ramadoss, who was confident that the national measles programme would
not suffer due to the deaths, added, "I have asked a high-level team
to visit the area and enquire about the incident including testing
the quality of vaccine, status of the cold chain, quality of
diluants, distribution and administration of the vaccine including
any human error that could have led to this adverse event following
immunisation."

The minister said experts of the polio programme had already been
deputed to Tamil Nadu to assist the state in investigating the
deaths. The polio programme has been undertaking detailed
surveillance for measles since last year [2007]. Alongside polio,
surveillance for measles was underway in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka,
Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Gujarat, and West Bengal.

[This incident appears to be something other than rare cases of
anaphylactic reactions following measles vaccination. The results of
the investigation in progress are awaited with interest.
