See also: 6 July 2001, 11 February 2000
(Date of last previously reported outbreak in the State of Selangor:
March 2000).
Emergency report
Information received on 20 July 2001 from Dr Mohd Nordin Mohd
Nor, Director General, Department of Veterinary Service, Ministry of
Agriculture, Kuala Lumpur:
Report date: 16 July 2001.
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, post-mortem and laboratory.
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 21 June 2001.
Estimated date of first infection: 13 June 2001.
Outbreaks: Location/No. of outbreaks
Sg. Kelambu, Mukim Tanjung Dua Belas, Kuala Langat district, State of
Selangor (2ยบ 47' N - 101ยบ 33' E)/ 1
Total number of animals in the outbreak:
Species/ susceptible/ cases/ deaths/ destroyed/ slaughtered
Bov/ 40/11*/ 0/ 0/ 0
* aged 6 to 18 months.
Diagnosis: foot and mouth disease (FMD) infection was detected upon
investigation of a complaint by a farmer on 20 June 2001 that 3 out of
40 cattle he owned were hypersalivating and limping. The next day, 1
out of 2 examined had ulcers on the tongue and dental pad as well as
interdigital erosion and hoof separation at the coronary band.
Subsequent visits to the farm on 22 June detected a total of 11 cattle
with clinical signs.
A. Laboratory where diagnosis was made: on 26 June, samples were
sent to the Regional Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, Kota Bharu,
State of Kelantan (the results were received on 1 July), and duplicate
samples for subtyping were sent to the World Reference Laboratory for
FMD, Pirbright, United Kingdom (results not yet received).
B. Diagnostic tests used: epithelial tissue of 2 out of 8 cases was
positive to ELISA(1) for antigen detection.
C. Causal agent: FMD virus type O.
Epidemiology:
A. Source of agent / origin of infection: endemic situation whereby
susceptible unvaccinated young cattle were infected.
B. Other epidemiological details: further investigations conducted
several days later on all herds sharing common grazing grounds,
detected 36 (out of a total of 514) with clinical signs compatible with
FMD. Samples were taken for laboratory diagnosis.
Control measures:
- isolation of cattle with FMD signs and other in-contact cattle from the
rest of the herd;
- quarantine, and movement control of animals from/into infected areas;
- disinfection of infected areas;
- daily monitoring of herds within the vicinity and isolation of any new
cases detected;
- ring vaccination of local cattle within a 5-km radius of the focus;
- control programme covering the whole country.
(1) ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

[Previous FMD outbreaks in Selangor state have been attributed to
movement of livestock across the border with Burma (Myanmar) -- see
ref. above -- but the authorities now appear to consider the disease to
be endemic in Selangor -- see Epidemiology A. above. - Mod.JW
