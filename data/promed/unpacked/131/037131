Thanks for highlighting this one. I go back to Kabul on 12 Jan 2008
[He was on R&R in France. - Mod.MHJ]. I'll try and see if any attempt
has been made to make an accurate diagnosis of this suspected outbreak.
It would seem to me to be unlikely to find only one single camel
affected; I would have expected that sheep would be more likely to
pick the disease up if there were spores around on the surface of the
ground, and then the multiplication effect might allow the outbreak
to spill over to other species. You are right that the disease was
always thought to be more common in the north and east of
Afghanistan. But there have been no real accurate records made or
kept for about 30 years, so the pattern may have changed from the
times when things like that were better documented. My project is
trying to put in place a refurbished laboratory diagnostic service as
well as a disease reporting system. At the moment, the disease
reports are based on clinical suspicion, which is very unreliable, as
Afghan vets and "paravets" tend to jump to conclusions without really
analysing the signs of the disease or the case histories of the
affected animals. But we hope to gradually improve that once we see
what they start to report and once we get some specimens into
laboratories for a laboratory diagnostic confirmation. [Because of
these limitations], we base the disease reporting system at this
stage on clinical signs observed, rather than a presumptive
diagnosis, in order to try to overcome this problem.
There are many Kuchi in the south of Afghanistan, and at this time of
year, they should be living in their traditional winter locations.
They will migrate towards the mountains in the spring. Those living
in Nimroz at the moment would be most likely to migrate towards the
north and east (Uruzgan, Ghor) as the spring approaches, but this
will depend on the security situation. They may well have to go to
less risky areas, so it is difficult to predict exactly where they will go.

I only returned to Kabul yesterday evening and read your message this
morning. From what I have been told, the Ministry of Public Health
ran some tests here in their Central Diagnostic Labs as well as sent
some samples to CDC for confirmation. From what I was told, the
samples tested positive here, and I anticipate that CDC will confirm this.
I cannot confirm where all of the animal cases of anthrax have been
reported in the past, but from what the veterinary practitioners and
provincial veterinarians have told me, I believe that it is pretty
much throughout the country. The government is currently
manufacturing anthrax vaccine in its Animal Vaccine Production
Facility, and it is sold throughout the country.

[Our thanks to John and Bob for their updates and information.
Clearly, John, his Afghan colleagues, and Bob have their work cut out
for them in getting the Afghan veterinary service back to what it was
30 years ago. About 35 years ago, a friend and colleague of mine,
Bill Miller, was stationed in Kabul working with their veterinary
service, which was competent, though not of the highest standard. A
few years later, after the Soviet invasion, at an FAO meeting in
Rome, I met the Russian appointed head of the Afghan national
brucellosis eradication programme. He was not up to standard. Such
events rip a service apart, and it takes decades to rebuild. The
present situation in the country does not make it easier. - Mod.MHJ]
