The Manitowoc County (WI) Health Department has determined the probable
source of infection for 6 of the 7 _E. coli_ [O157:H7] cases reported to
the department between 30 Aug and 11 Sep 2006, according to a statement
released by the department today, 6 Oct 2006.
One case, involving the death of a 77-year-old woman, was linked to the
multi-state spinach outbreak, one to animal exposure at a private farm, and
4 to exposure at the Manitowoc County Expo Grounds during the Manitowoc
County Fair. Of the 4 individuals linked to the Manitowoc County Expo
Grounds, 2 had direct contact with animals and the others had no direct
exposure to animals.
As part of the investigation, health officials collected samples from 50
sites in the dairy and show barns and tested them for _E. coli_ bacteria.
Two samples collected in the bleachers of the show barn were positive for
_E. coli_ and matched bacteria from 2 of the cases and was similar to a
3rd. Additionally, the environmental isolates matched 2 samples of _E.
coli_ from Washington County, from people who attended an event at the
Manitowoc County Expo Grounds on 1 Jul 2006.
Based on this information, the probable source of infection for the 3
Manitowoc County and 2 Washington County cases was transfer from the
environment, according to the health department. The 4th fair attendee had
no laboratory connection to any other case or environmental sample.
The public works department cleaned the bleachers in the show barn with a
disinfecting cleaner after the samples were taken. Additional measures to
prevent disease associated with animals in public settings will be
implemented in the near future, according to the release.

[One of the notable observations here is that several of the cases had no
direct exposure to the farm animals at the county fair, and the exposure
was related to a contaminated environment. A previous report suggested a
similar conclusion. (Varma JK, Greene KD, Reller ME, et al:An Outbreak of
_Escherichia coli_ O157 Infection Following Exposure to a Contaminated
Building. JAMA 2003;290: 2709-12) The abstract of this publication is below.
"Objectives. To determine risk factors for _E. coli_ O157 infection during
an outbreak investigation at a county fair and to evaluate environmental
contamination as a possible cause of the outbreak.
Design, Setting, and Participants. Case-control study of 23 patients
(median age, 15 years) and 53 age-matched controls who had attended the
Lorain County, Ohio, fair between 20 and 26 Aug 2001. Case-patients had
laboratory-confirmed _E. coli_ O157 infection, hemolytic uremic syndrome,
or bloody diarrhea within 7 days of attending the fair; controls attended
the fair and did not have diarrhea.
Main Outcome Measures. Risk factors for infection and isolates of _E.
coli_ O157 from environmental specimens.
Results. 6 (26 percent) case-patients were hospitalized and 2 (9 percent)
developed hemolytic uremic syndrome. Case-patients were more likely than
controls to have visited building A (a multipurpose community facility on
the fairgrounds; matched odds ratio [MOR], 21.4 [95 percent confidence
interval {CI}, 2.7-170.7]). Among visitors to building A, illness was
independently associated with attending a dance in the building (MOR, 7.5;
95 percent CI, 1.4-41.2), handling sawdust from the floor (MOR, 4.6; 95
percent CI, 1.1-20.0), or eating and/or drinking in the building (MOR, 4.5;
95 percent CI, 1.2-16.6). 24 (44 percent) of 54 specimens collected from
building A 6 weeks after the fair grew Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_
O157. Isolates from sawdust, the rafters, and other surfaces were identical
by molecular fingerprinting to patient isolates. Sawdust specimens
collected 42 weeks after the fair also grew the same _E. coli_ O157 strain.
Conclusions. Absence of evidence implicating specific food or beverage
sources and the recovery of _E. coli_ O157 from the rafters suggest that
airborne dispersion of bacteria contributed to the contamination. Because
_E. coli_ O157 can survive in the environment for more than 10 months,
humans may be at risk of infection long after an environment is initially
contaminated."
A similar scenario may well have occurred in this Wisconsin outbreak.

Manitowoc County can be found on the central eastern edge of the
state. Washington County is south and west of Manitowoc but not adjacent
to it. - Mod.LL]
