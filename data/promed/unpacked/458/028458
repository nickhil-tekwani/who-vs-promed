A baby on a small Pacific island has become the 1st person given a vaccine delivered by a commercial drone. UNICEF arranged for the drone to be flown some 40 km (25 mi) across rugged mountains in Vanuatu that otherwise take hours to cross. About 20% of children in Vanuatu don't receive important vaccinations because the supply is too difficult. The UN children's organisation hopes that drone delivery will in the future be of vital importance in remote areas.

"Today's small flight by a drone is a big leap for global health," UNICEF executive director Henrietta Fore said. "With the world still struggling to immunize the hardest-to-reach children, drone technologies can be a game changer for bridging that last mile to reach every child."

While drones have been used before to deliver medicine, UNICEF says this was the 1st time globally that a country had contracted a commercial drone company to get vaccines to remote areas.

Two companies competed for the project on Vanuatu, and it was Australia's Swoop Aero that won the bid after successful trials earlier this month [December 2018]. Its drone carried the vaccines in a Styrofoam box with ice packs and a temperature logger to a remote village on the island of Erromango, from Dillon's Bay on the west of the island to Cook's Bay on the east. The medicine was then used by local nurse Miriam Nampil to vaccinate 13 children and 5 pregnant women.

Without the drone, Cook's Bay is only accessible on foot or by boat; both of those options take hours compared to the 25 minutes it took for the drone to reach the village. Medical supplies also have to be kept at a cold temperature.

"It's extremely hard to carry ice boxes to keep the vaccines cool while walking across rivers and mountains, through the rain, and across rocky ledges," Ms Nampil said. "As the journey is often long and difficult, I can only go there once a month to vaccinate children. But now, with these drones, we can hope to reach many more children in the remotest areas of the island."

A one-month-old baby in Vanuatu has become the 1st person in the world to be immunised using vaccines delivered by a commercial drone, the United Nations said, raising hopes that the method could save lives in other far-flung areas. The drone flew for 25 minutes across 40 km (24 miles) of mountainous terrain to get to the Cook's Bay area on the island of Erromango, which would otherwise have taken hours to reach on foot or by boat.

Vanuatu is the world's 1st government to contract a commercial drone company to deliver vaccines, according to the UN children's agency, UNICEF, which called the successful trial on Tuesday [18 Dec 2018] a "big leap for global health". A nurse picked up the vaccines, including those that immunize against polio and tuberculosis, and administered them to 13 children and 5 pregnant mothers.

"It is very innovative. I hope it will extend to a wider region," said Gina Dehinavanua, of humanitarian agency CARE International, on Wednesday [19 Dec 2019]. "It will help our kids and ensure those aged between zero and 5 have all the necessary vaccines to grow up as a child," she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from Vanuatu's capital, Port Vila.

The Pacific island nation, with about 280 000 people spread across roughly 80 islands, is one of the world's poorest countries. Only about a 3rd of its inhabited islands have airfields and proper roads. Out of every 1000 babies born in Vanuatu, 28 die before they reach the age of 5, according to UNICEF data from 2016, while only one in 5 children is fully immunised.

Vaccines are difficult to transport as they need to be kept at specific temperatures. During the drone flight, they were kept in Styrofoam boxes with ice packs and a temperature sensor.

"With the world still struggling to immunise the hardest-to-reach children, drone technologies can be a game changer for bridging that last mile to reach every child," UNICEF executive director Henrietta Fore said in a statement. Drone deliveries will be tested in more villages across the archipelago before Vanuatu's government decides if the method will be used more widely. Although drones have been used to deliver medicines before, they have yet to be deployed on a large scale for humanitarian purposes.

[Every so often there is an uplifting event that is reported in the media. This is one of them. This will potentially permit the transport of vaccines and medicines to more remote areas that frequently take days to get to. What is not specifically mentioned is the need to have trained personnel on the ground where the supplies are going, to guarantee the safe administration of the vaccines (and/or medications). The article states there was a nurse in the area prepared to administer the vaccines to children and pregnant women.

Nevertheless, a happy note as we approach the end of 2018.

Checking our archives, we reported on UNICEF's use of drones to map out cholera cases and photograph areas showing latrines and water sources in the capital city in Malawi (see Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery update (06): Africa, Asia, Oceania 20180216.5633227). In 2016, the US Fish and Wildlife Service used drones to "shoot" vaccine-covered M&Ms to protect the endangered black-footed ferret from a plague epidemic in Montana (see Plague, animal - USA (08): (MT) ferret, prairie dog, drone-delivered vaccine 20160714.4345331 for more details on this activity).

"Vanuatu, the Republic of Vanuatu (French: Republique de Vanuatu, Bislama: Ripablik blong Vanuatu) is a Pacific island country located in the South Pacific Ocean. The archipelago, which is of volcanic origin, is 1750 km (1090 mi) east of northern Australia, 540 km (340 mi) northeast of New Caledonia, east of New Guinea, southeast of the Solomon Islands, and west of Fiji.

"Vanuatu was 1st inhabited by Melanesian people. The 1st Europeans to visit the islands were a Spanish expedition led by Portuguese navigator Fernandes de Queiros, who arrived on the largest island in 1606. Since the Portuguese and Spanish monarchies had been unified under the king of Spain in 1580 (following the vacancy of the Portuguese throne, which lasted for 60 years, until 1640, when the Portuguese monarchy was restored), Queiros claimed the archipelago for Spain, as part of the colonial Spanish East Indies, and named it La Austrialia del Espiritu Santo.

"In the 1880s, France and the UK claimed parts of the archipelago, and in 1906, they agreed on a framework for jointly managing the archipelago as the New Hebrides through an Anglo-French condominium. An independence movement arose in the 1970s, and the Republic of Vanuatu was founded in 1980. Since independence, the country is a member of the United Nations, Commonwealth of Nations, Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, and the Pacific Islands Forum."
