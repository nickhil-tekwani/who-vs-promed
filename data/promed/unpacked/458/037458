[1 Bird-to-Man Transmission Affirmed, South China Morning Post, 10 Dec 1997
Deputy Health Director Dr. Paul Saw Thian-aun told this paper that the 2
children infected by H5N1 [1 fatality, 1 recovery "caught it through
direct contact with birds." This statement was based on tests done at CDC
in Atlanta. Dr. Saw reported, however, that the families of the 2 children
are "adamant" that they did not ever have close contact with birds. [On the
other hand, a major wire service reported yesterday that the children had
contact with chickens on a farm. - DP.
Other developments reported by the South China Morning Post:
12,000 tablets of amantadine (Symmetrel) are being flown in on an emergency
basis, after there was a "run on the drug in the past two days ... and
private practitioners are unable to buy supplies from the limited stocks of
manufacturers." This shipment, enough to treat 1200 persons, will not
arrive until next week.

[2 Call for Widespread Blood Tests, Hong Kong Standard, 10 Dec 1997
Provisional legislator Edward Leong Che-hung called for the administration
of a new blood test to a random sample of 1-2 thousand people in Hong Kong
to see if, or how many, others may have contracted the virus. But,
according to Dr. P.Y. Lam, another director in the Hong Kong Health
Department, this is not yet feasible because the test has not yet been
released for use and probably would not be ready for "some time". Dr Lam
agreed that a survey using the test could possibly indicate antibodies to
the virus in healthy people which would suggest wide circulation of the
virus without epidemic consequences. If this were true, he said, "Then the
harm is much less." [I would like to know what this new test is.
Interpreting the results of a field survey with a newly and possibly
hastily developed test may not clarify the situation, only confuse it. -
Mod. PC Dr. Lam will be passing on the legislator's suggestion to CDC
specialists, three more of whom are scheduled to arrive.
Other developments reported by the Hong Kong Standard:
The hospital authority has advised barrier nursing for staff who came in
contact with the victims. Staff members who have already developed flu
symptoms are being treated with amantadine, are scheduled for virological
tests, and are barred from duties
"until symptoms subside."

[3 Adult Fatality Was Dentist, South China Morning Post, 9 Dec 1997
According to this report, the 54-year-old man who died from H5N1 was a
dentist who treated patients during the week before his death.
Complicating the attempt by health authorities to trace the patients is the
fact that the dentist was practicing illegally.
