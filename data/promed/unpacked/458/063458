University of Minnesota equine specialists have been working to curb an outbreak of a highly-contagious, airborne virus that can hinder brain and spinal cord function in horses.

Five of 7 horses on a central Minnesota farm have shown signs of neurologic equine herpes virus-1, which damages blood vessels in the brain and spinal cord. One of the horses has been euthanized, and another remains hospitalized in quarantine at the Large Animal Hospital on the St. Paul, according to a report from the University's College of Veterinary Medicine. The other 2 have been returned to their home after showing improvement.

There were 3 other horses on the farm, one mildly affected and 2 believed to be unaffected. They are being closely monitored by their owners, the report said.

Last fall, the virus hit several states in the U.S. and caused the cancellation of dozens of equine events across the nation. An Illinois' racetrack has seen 48 positive tests since mid-October 2012, according to the Daily Racing Forum.

The herpes virus in horses is passed from horse to horse contact through the respiratory tract, according to a report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The disease cannot spread to humans, but they can transport virus from horse to horse through their clothes, according to CVM. The virus can also spread between horses from sharing equipment like bridles or water and feed buckets.

A spokesperson from the University Equine Center said the virus is unlikely to spread to other horses in the University area because the infected horses are being kept in special quarantine.

Clinical signs to look for in horses with the virus include fever, weakness, incoordination and urine dribbling or the inability to urinate, according to the USDA.

[Equine herpesvirus (EHV-1) infection in horses can cause respiratory and neurological disease, abortion in mares, and neonatal foal death. The neurological form of the disease is known as equine herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHM) and has the potential to cause high morbidity and mortality.

EHV-1 is easily spread and typically has an incubation period between 2-10 days. Respiratory shedding of the virus generally occurs for 7-10 days but may persist longer in infected horses. For this reason, the isolation period recommendation for confirmed positive EHM cases is 21 days. Clinical signs of EHM in horses may include nasal discharge, incoordination, hindquarter weakness, recumbency, lethargy, urine dribbling, and diminished tail tone. The prognosis for EHM positive horses depends on the severity of signs and the period of recumbency. Employing supportive treatment with intravenous fluids, anti-inflammatory drugs, anti-viral drugs, and other supportive measures may be beneficial, since there is no specific treatment for EHM.
