E. coli O157, prevalence in livestock - UK 20010915.2225
Date: 16 Sep 2001
From: Dr. Oddgeirsson <fcc@ooddgeirsson.freeserve.co.uk>

I read with interest comments about _E. coli_ O157 in your last mail. I
certainly agree it is important to look at the whole chain, from producer
to procedures in the kitchen, however I would like to emphasize 1 part of
the chain which was not commented in your mail, which is slaughter hygiene.
Proper dressing of cattle is not an easy task at the best of times, but
heavily contaminated cattle are almost impossible to dehide without some
contamination.
I would like to propose 2 main avenues of action, both of which require no
new rules or regulation, they are already there. The first, and perhaps
the most important, is to accept only clean animals for slaughter, the
second is to tighten up on procedures during dehiding and evisceration of
cattle. Both could be achieved through the existing system of official
veterinarians in the slaughterhouses.
Contaminated cattle should not pass through ante-mortem inspection and
official veterinarians must accept only the highest standard of slaughter
hygiene in the premises they supervise and in the case of breach of such
standards, make an increased use of stopping the slaughter process.
The routines in the kitchen and restaurants are certainly important and
should not be underestimated, but I disagree that it is the most important
line of defense. The further down the distribution chain you go, the
higher the number of people you have to educate. It is not acceptable to
allow this kind of contamination to arrive in the kitchen in the first
place. We have to find ways and means of stopping the "distribution of
contamination" before it arrives in the kitchen.

[Without question, the further down the food chain, the more people there
are to educate. But this is easily taught in schools, in homes and even
demonstrated in schools and homes. Likewise, if dehiding is a concern, then
perhaps you should look at policy of washing the animals before they arrive
for slaughter or before the carcass has its hide removed. All of this takes
more time than most slaughter houses are willing to spend. Although this
may well be an important step in decreasing the contamination, it does not
diminish the need to teach and practice hygiene in the kitchen. Until there
is further evidence of this outbreak, this thread is cut. - Mod.TG
