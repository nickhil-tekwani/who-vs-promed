So far 4 cases of mysterious illness in Northern Virginia horses have been
attributed to equine herpesvirus (EHV) myeloencephalopathy, a rare
neurological version of EHV type 1 infection, which is typically recognized
in its respiratory form as rhinopneumonitis. Besides 3 horses at Fox Chase
Farm in Middleburg that have been euthanized, one pony is recovering at the
farm under supportive care. The incidents have concerned horse owners in
the area about travel and exposure of their horses, and veterinarians are
alert for any other unusual symptoms.
Test results at the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer
Services' Warrenton Regional Animal Health Laboratory and the National
Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa, have been "inconclusive," but
scientists have ruled out other possible neurologic diseases and have
strong evidence from clinical signs and histopathology reports that EHV is
what caused the disease.
"In this instance, we do have negative tests for West Nile virus, equine
encephalitis, and for EPM (equine protozoal myeloencephalitis)," said
Joseph P Garvin, DVM, laboratory director of the Warrenton lab. "There are
still tests pending, and I have my fingers crossed that we'll have
definitive answers. The results have been very suggestive of equine
herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy."
Garvin explained tests of the tissue are conclusive only if EHV-1 is grown
out from the tissue or its DNA is found through one of many very sensitive
laboratory tests. To complicate the matter, the virus might not be present
in the horses by the time of their deaths, so tests might come back
negative. "The organism causing equine herpesvirus-1 can cause 3 different
forms of the disease," he explained, "rhinopneumonitis, a respiratory
disease of mostly young horses, abortions in pregnant mares, and this
neurologic disease." There are at least 7 other strains of equine
herpesviruses, named in order of their discovery (see article #32 at
for more on herpesviruses).
Typically, horses suffering from EHV-1 myeloencephalopathy have a fever
prior to developing neurologic disease symptoms. According to Garvin, the
Virginia horses did not have fever. However, each displayed "hindlimb
ataxia, loss of control of their bladder, a flaccid tail, and they
eventually went down. One of the horses had forelimb ataxia, which occurs a
certain percentage of the time," he explained. "The horse that had the
forelimb ataxia also had a head tilt and histologic lesions on the brain."
"With the history, clinical signs, and the tests that we've run, it all
fits together very nicely," Garvin said. "It seems like (the horses) read
the textbook as far as the signs they showed."
The first affected horse was not submitted for testing. Signs were
recognized in the second horse on 19 Apr 2002 and the horse was euthanized
on 22 Apr 2002. The third horse became affected on 24 Apr 2002 and was
euthanized on 26 Apr 2002. The neurological form of EHV-1 infection often
is curable with supportive care, but unfortunately once a horse is down, it
is difficult to nurse the horse back to health, and owners and
veterinarians elected to euthanize these 3 animals.
According to reports, the horses were vaccinated regularly for
rhinopneumonitis, so horse owners have, naturally enough, asked why the
horses were infected. Veterinarians have said no vaccine manufacturer has
made a vaccine saying it will prevent the neurological form of EHV-1 from
occurring. The duration of immunity to EHV is not as long as it is with
some other viruses, so generally veterinarians vaccinate twice a year.
The source of infection remains unknown, but reports have suggested one of
the horses might have contracted the virus at a horse show. The Virginia
Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services has made no recommendation
as to whether shows should be cancelled or farms quarantined in the light
of the incomplete test results, but many farms [including Fox Chase Farm]
have taken precautionary measures and have not moved horses.
