Since the official confirmation of lumpy skin disease (LSD) in central Sumatra in March 2022, the spread of the disease had been tightly restricted to the northern half of Sumatra until it was confirmed near Semarang in Central Java in September [2022].

In an earlier article, [the author] speculated that the reason for the failure of the disease to spread south and east out from central [Sumatra] was due to the monsoonal wind direction (https://www.beefcentral.com/news/why-isnt-lumpy-skin-disease-spreading-the-answer-is-blowin-in-the-wind/).

LSD has now been confirmed in East Java near the city of Blitar with many other unofficial reports across a broad area from southern Sumatra (Bandar Lampung) to West Java (Jakarta area) and other parts of East Java, including near the city of Malang, capital of Java's main dairy district [see map at https://www.beefcentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/LSD-in-East-Java-1.png].

The number 17 in the yellow circle [on the map] is the official data on the number of LSD cases near Semarang in Central Java. The new confirmations are in Blitar located between Malang and Kendari. Note Darwin in the bottom right of the map.

Given the wind direction during this current northeast monsoon, it seems likely that this insect-borne disease is likely to continue to spread in a southerly and easterly direction towards Timor and subsequently northern Australia [see map showing wind direction for the northeastern monsoon: October to May, at https://www.beefcentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/LSD-in-East-Java-2.png].

There are very little hard data on the real progress of LSD, as the government has been so busy dealing with the foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreak that LSD has quite rightly been a secondary concern. In addition, the Indonesian government has a policy of not publicising these disease outbreaks, so even when disease information is collected it may not be made available to the public.

This reluctance to provide open access to information relating to the progress of LSD makes attempts to predict its future movements very difficult. In addition to these policy matters, the disease itself also appears to be behaving in unexpected ways [see comment below].

For instance, when individual animals are infected, other animals in the same group often remain clinically unaffected. Despite the fact that insect numbers during an equatorial, Indonesian monsoon season are astronomical, the disease does not appear to spread as quickly as you would expect if the transmission was a simple matter of biting insects moving on from one animal to others in the group or nearby.

There is so much we don't know about LSD. Since the origin of the disease in Africa and its spread through the Middle East, Turkey, Central Asia, Russia, China then down through Southeast Asia, LSD has never infected a country that is a major exporter of beef. As a result the disease has been managed through the use of a relatively effective live vaccine. Very little research appears to have been conducted in these locations to assist in understanding how this disease is spread. Also all these countries have cattle and buffalo populations that are under close individual management. Earlier in 2022 [the author] had imagined the LSD virus moving in an epidemic wave of insects infecting large numbers of cattle in its path. Instead, what we are seeing at the moment is low rates of random and unpredictable spread resulting in small numbers of infected animals separated by large distances.

If the disease reaches Australia, this will be the 1st time that it has infected a major beef exporter where a large proportion of the herd is managed in remote areas where individual animal care is not generally available. For all the countries infected between Africa and Indonesia, the disease is only a minor to moderate threat to their domestic beef industries. The threat to Australia is totally different.

The introduction of FMD would be a catastrophic event causing massive and immediate animal welfare and commercial losses, which could subsequently be halted by intensive biosecurity measures which would almost certainly lead to eradication in 1 or 2 years. By contrast, LSD will be a long-term, chronic problem where losses are moderate compared with FMD, but ongoing with little hope of eradication. Vaccination programs in northern Australia are invariably incomplete. The total losses from LSD over many decades may well match the one-off cost of an FMD incursion and eradication.

Even if there are only a small percentage of animals infected in northern Australia, the cumulative cost of the losses over time will be huge: reduced conception rates, abortions, fever, reduced appetite and growth rates, reduced milk yield, secondary infections of the skin and respiratory tract, reduced serving capacity by affected bulls. Even if there are only 5% of animals in northern Australia affected, the impact of these losses spread over the entire domestic herd for decades would be enormous. Then add the additional costs of vaccinations and other management attempts to address the problems such as increasing resources for fly control. Don't forget this disease had a major impact on the dairy industry in the cold climate of northern China, so the impact in Australia would be seen from Darwin to the bottom of Tasmania with no areas escaping infection.

Australian government experts have estimated that there is a 28% likelihood of an outbreak of LSD in the next 5 years. [The author doesn't] have the same information that they have, but if the insects carrying the virus can't manage to fly from Timor to Darwin then we just have to wait until they work their way around the islands to the east then pass through New Guinea and then complete the short flight across the Torres Strait.

If a betting man, [the author] would be prepared to wager that LSD has a 100% chance of reaching Australia during the next 5 years.

[The behaviour of LSD in Indonesia is probably less "unexpected" than suggested. Two illustrative historical events follow:

The 1st description of the clinical signs of LSD dates to 1929, communicated from Northern Rhodesia (to become Zambia in 1968), where it was coined "Pseudo urticaria." Its 1st detailed epidemiological studies, pointing at viral etiology, came from South Africa. The virus arrived there in 1944 and got its final name, lumpy skin disease (in Afrikaans, "Knopvelsiekte"). The disease presented "peculiar epizootiological features" (Weiss et al, 1968; https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-662-39771-8.pdf).

Between its initial introduction to Transvaal in 1944 until mid-1946, LSD spread widely, reaching the Cape region in "unexplained" long-range leaps. Until 1949, the estimated number of affected cattle reached 6 million. Sporadic outbreaks of the disease continued to appear throughout the ensuing years in widely separated parts of South Africa, especially during the summer months, although fresh outbreaks have also been reported during mid-winter. At irregular intervals of several years, the disease assumed epizootic proportions, probably due to the buildup of a sufficiently large susceptible population. Although the disease also affected beef cattle in the ranching areas, most of the outbreaks occurred in the dairying districts with dense cattle populations. It was stated that the worst cases involved cattle breeds with thin skin, that is, mainly the milk breeds (Holstein, Jersey, Guernsey). The disease was found to be more prevalent during the wet summer months, particularly in low-lying areas and along water courses, where its spread could not be controlled effectively by quarantine measures. However, several investigators stated that LSD could spread in the absence of insects and even under conditions where direct or indirect contact of infected with susceptible animals did not exist, though fomites were suspected. Morbidity rates, within an affected holding, ranged from 5% to 45%, though even lower rates were recorded.

The 1st LSD outbreak in Israel, in 1989, involved the village Peduyim and included 17 dairy farms. On 20 Aug 1989, the village's vet was called to check 2 cows in 2 different farms that presented an unusual skin condition. He suspected allergy. Blood count of both cows was normal. During his next visit, 24 Aug 1989, the skin lesions of both cows became more pronounced; "allergy" was replaced by "urticaria." One of the cows presented edema of lungs and legs, and its differential blood count indicated neutrophilia (N 78, L 20, J 1, M 1, Eos 0). The other cow was also neutrophilic, to a lesser extent. On 15 Sep 1989, this cow also presented edema and severe neutrophilia; eosinophilia remained absent. At that date, additional similar cases were reported from other farms. Experts' advise was sought, leading to suspicion of LSD, a disease never recorded or suspected in Israel before.

Following lab confirmation, LSD was officially recognized and it was decided to try eradicating the emerging epizootic by culling and disposal of all clinically affected animals and to slaughter all remaining cattle, in affected and unaffected farms, compensating the farmers. During the 37 days that elapsed since the start of the event and the date of slaughter, the disease became recorded in 14 of the 17 farms, in which (clinical) morbidity rates varied from 1.1% to 75% (mean, 11.4%). One animal was emergency-slaughtered. From 2 adjacent villages, 1 and 4 cows, respectively, were reported having similar skin lesions. AII 5 were culled. It was assumed that this was an iatrogenic infection, transmitted by an injector used earlier in Peduyim. All depopulated cowsheds in Peduyim were disinfected, allowing their repopulation more than 3 months later. A single vaccination of all dairy cattle, with a sheep-pox vaccine, was applied in municipalities within a 10-km (6.2 mi) radius around the outbreak. Israel remained free of LSD until 2006.

A year earlier (1988), LSD was reported in Egypt for the 1st time, including outbreaks in the Nile Delta, Ismailiya on the Suez canal and El Arish in northern Sinai. It was hypothetized that LSDV could have reached Peduyim by infected vectors (stable flies?) carried by the wind from one of the said locations. Meteorological data supported such possible scenario, which remains theoretical. Egypt became endemically infected since 1988, applying annual mass vaccination against LSD.

Both primary events, in South Africa and Israel, presented epidemiological similarities to the recent event in Indonesia: odd cases in some affected holdings, slow spreading between farms in a village and inter-village, in contrast with the spreading rate/speed expected when biting insects are involved.
