At least 4 cases of monkeypox were confirmed in Nigeria in July 2021, according to a report by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC).

A 2017 outbreak spread to at least 14 states and sparked nationwide panic, but it became largely forgotten until a man tested positive in the United States after arriving from Nigeria early last month [July 2021]. The NCDC said it was notified of the case and is supporting the relevant state governments in Nigeria to carry out outbreak investigation and response.

A total of 17 monkeypox cases have been confirmed in Delta (6), Lagos (4), Bayelsa (3), Rivers (3), and Edo (1) since the beginning of the year [2021], with no deaths.

This year's haul is already more than double the 8 cases that were confirmed last year [2020]. Of the nearly 500 cases reported since the 2017 outbreak, 209 have been confirmed in 18 states, with 8 deaths in 4 years.

Monkeypox response in Nigeria is coordinated by a multi-agency Technical Working Group at NCDC, with offsite support provided to states. Low utilisation of health facilities by patients due to stigmatisation, cost, and low mortality rate, as well as low sample-collection rate in reporting states, have been identified as significant challenges to the national response.

[Nigeria continues to have substantial numbers of monkeypox (MPX) cases this year (2021). The previous report on 10 Jun 2021 indicated that a total of 32 suspected cases had been reported from January and May [2021]. Of these suspected cases, 7 were confirmed from 5 states -- Delta (2), Bayelsa (2), Lagos (1), Edo (1), Rivers (1) -- and no deaths were recorded.

The continued increase in MPX cases in July 2021 is not surprising. As noted previously, MPX virus is endemic in Nigeria and widespread there geographically and can be a source of infection for travelers. A man with MPX virus infection traveled from Nigeria to Texas, USA, and another infected man traveled to the UK recently this year (2021). One wonders if many of the reported suspected cases in Nigeria that have not been laboratory confirmed may be chickenpox, caused by varicella-zoster virus. There is no specific information about the circumstances under which these cases acquired their infection. Contact with infected carrier rodents may be the source of MPX virus transmission.

Monkeys are not the reservoirs of the virus, despite the name that the virus has received. Studies of the prevalence of MPX virus in populations of rodent hosts are not mentioned in this or previous reports. The main reservoirs of MPX virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp, an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_. Halting the bushmeat trade and consumption of wild animals to halt MPX virus exposure will be culturally and economically difficult, so continued occurrence of cases can be expected. MPX virus can be transmitted between people but not readily. - Mod.TY
