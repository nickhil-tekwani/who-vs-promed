Leafy brassica greens: emergency fungicide registration for downy mildew
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA) recently announced the
approval of an emergency use registration for Rampart [trademark of
Loveland Products, Inc.] fungicide (potassium salts of phosphorous
acid) for suppression of downy mildew on leafy brassica greens in
Ontario because of a severe downy mildew outbreak combined with a low
supply of registered fungicides in eastern North America. Crops
include mustard greens, bok choy, pak choy, yow choy, gai choy,
collards, kale, mizuna, mustard spinach, and rape greens.

Ontario leafy brassica producers have identified downy mildew as a
top disease priority for several years. Although there are a few
registered downy mildew fungicides, the supplies of the key
fungicides were used up very quickly in 2009 due to widespread
disease outbreaks on several major crops. Without access to Rampart
fungicide, the Ontario leafy brassica crops industry faced the risk
of very serious losses to downy mildew in 2009 and in fact the risk
of serious losses remains critical.

The emergency use registration of Rampart fungicide will help in the
interim to manage the current downy mildew outbreak; however
management of downy mildew requires a comprehensive Integrated Pest
Management (IPM) and resistance management program with access to all
available tools and strategies. Fungicide should be used in an IPM
program and in rotation with other management strategies to
adequately manage resistance.

[Downy mildew of _Brassica_ species is caused by the fungus
_Hyaloperonospora parasitica_ (previously _Peronospora parasitica_).
It affects a range of crops in the family of _Brassicaceae_,
including all types of cabbages, turnips, radish and oilseed rape.
Infection and disease development are favoured by cool, wet weather.
The pathogen mainly attacks foliage leading to yellowing and
premature leaf drop. It may also be responsible for substantial
losses in seedling production.

Spores are produced on the underside of leaves overnight and
dispersed by wind and rain splash. The fungus is known to survive on
seed and on several species of cruciferous weeds, and also as
oospores in plant debris in the soil from one crop to the next. For
disease management, as mentioned above, an integrated approach is
most effective, including cultural practices to reduce leaf wetness,
use of clean seeds or seedlings, and fungicides.
