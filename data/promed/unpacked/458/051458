Poultry infected with avian flu, Ag Forte turkeys carried mild
strain, other flocks, humans not threatened.
-----------------------------------------------
Ag Forte, an Aurora-based poultry company, has quarantined, and will
slaughter, a flock of 14 000 turkeys, after the birds tested positive
for a strain of avian influenza.

The strain of bird flu detected, H3N2, poses no risk of transfer to
humans, said David Compton, Barry and Lawrence County emergency
management director. "There's not [a] threat to anybody or any other
flocks," Compton said on Tuesday [14 Sep 2004]. "This was handled
very appropriately. Ag Forte, as a matter of prevention, quarantined
that flock."

After slaughter, the turkeys will be sold for meat, and that meat is
safe for consumption, said Rick Vanderspek, general manager and chief
operating officer for Ag Forte. The meat will go into "further
processed" foods, such as turkey pot pies, or other foods using
turkey as an ingredient.

This strain of the bird flu, as well as most others detected in North
America, are considered low pathogenic and are fairly mild compared
with the high-pathogenic flu in Asian countries. The Asian strains
have been devastating to that region's poultry industry and have
caused some human deaths.

The affected turkeys in Missouri were breed stock for Ag Forte, a
company that produces turkey eggs, hatches those eggs, and sells the
baby turkeys, or poults, to other companies. The poultry companies
that buy the poults will then grow the birds until they are at
slaughter weight, Vanderspek said.

It is common for Ag Forte to slaughter its breeder turkeys after
they've produced eggs for a certain amount of time. These turkeys,
however, will be slaughtered earlier than usual because of the
detection of avian influenza.

This low-pathogenic avian flu strain is usually found among swine.
Low pathogenic viruses cause less severe or no illness when they
infect poultry.

Ag Forte had some signs of the disease in its birds, before a routine
test for the virus detected it. "We check monthly for the virus. We
test in our own labs and submit it to the state," Vanderspek said.
"Before that, we'd noticed our egg production wasn't what we
expected. That was a warning sign."

Ag Forte owns the farm and the turkeys where the flu was detected.

For at least 30 days after the detection of avian influenza, Lawrence
County, and counties adjacent to it, will not be able to export
poultry to Russia, Vanderspek said. "Russian export laws say that if
any avian flu shows up, that state cannot export to Russia," he said.
In this case, the ban is limited to Lawrence and adjacent counties.

The detection of this low pathogenic flu is not expected to further
affect southwest Missouri's poultry industry, Compton said.

Ag Forte will lose some income as a result of the early slaughter of
the breeder turkeys, which were capable of producing eggs for several
more weeks. "We'll have some financial impact, though it won't be
devastating," Vanderspek said.

Ag Forte has about 250 000 breeding birds in its total operation.

[Although this is a low pathogenic version of the flu, depopulation
is the right move. It helps to stop the spread of the disease and
limits the effects on commerce. Also, low pathogenic strains can
mutate into highly pathogenic strains. It is not likely to happen
with this strain, but, certainly, depopulation will prevent it from
happening. - Mod.TG]
