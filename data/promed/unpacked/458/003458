[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Berger for the summary of imported human West
Nile virus infections. Although these infected individuals pose no
threat as a source for ongoing transmission, they are an interesting
indication of where these infections were acquired. Most were
acquired in the USA, which is not surprising since the virus has
become endemic there after its introduction in 1999. One case was
acquired in Nicaragua. WNV human clinical cases are rarely reported
in Central America and none has come to the attention of ProMED. The
4 cases originating in Djibouti indicate virus transmission in that
East African country in 2005, and leads one to wonder if there were
more cases among local residents who did not travel to France (see
ProMED-mail archive no. 20050607.1585), hence, went undiagnosed or
unreported. These cases are good examples of how infected individuals
can move great distances quickly, and could serve as sources of
outbreaks of those viruses that can be transmitted among humans in
situations where ongoing transmission mechanisms are in place. - Mod.TY]
