A cholera outbreak in Tanzania's commercial capital, Dar es Salaam, has
killed 5 people and affected 820 others, mostly women and children, who
have been hospitalized in the last few weeks, heath officials said on Mon,
13 Nov 2006.
"We call upon the public to observe health precautions by keeping their
environment clean, boiling drinking water and making use of toilets," Tatu
Mwaruka, a health officer in the city's Ilala Municipality, said. Ilala is
one of the districts forming the Dar es Salaam region with Kinondoni and
Temeke. All combine to make the city of Dar es Salaam.
Mwaruka said the outbreak was worse in the suburbs because of the public's
"reluctance to observe hygiene".
Health officials in Tanzania's semi-autonomous island of Zanzibar have also
recorded the hospitalization of least 16 people following an outbreak of
dysentery and diarrhea in Stone Town, capital of the island.
"We have cases of diarrhea and dysentery, but no cases of cholera and
deaths," Omar Suleiman, the director of information policy in Zanzibar's
Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, said on Mon, 13 Nov 2006.
In Aug 2006, health officials in Zanzibar reported that at least 454
children had been admitted to the main Mnazi-Mmoja Hospital, suffering from
severe dysentery and diarrhea.
Cholera and diarrhea outbreaks started in Mar 2006, resurfaced in late May
and June 2006 and again in July and August 2006 in most areas of the
Zanzibar Municipality and Pemba Island.

[2] Cholera - Uganda

Nine districts in western, northwestern and central Uganda have been hit by
an outbreak of cholera, which has killed 7 in a northern district.
The affected districts are Nebbi, Arua, Yumbe, Koboko, Moyo and Adjumani in
northwestern region, Kasese, and Bundibugyo in western and the capital
Kampala in the central.
In Kampala, the outbreak has spread to the city suburbs of Katwe,
Mengo-Kisenyi, Namuwongo, Luzira, Katanga, Kalerwe and Kawempe. Local media
reported earlier this week that the epidemic had killed 7 residents and
left over 176 others hospitalized in Arua district, north of Uganda, since
12 Jul 2006.
Sam Okware, the acting director in-charge of health services at the
ministry of health quoted by the state-owned New Vision on Fri, 17 Nov
2006, attributed the rise of cholera cases to the continuous rains during
this rainy season.
"Kampala has always had low-grade cholera. I think the rains have made the
problem worse. Having 5 cases of cholera is not good. Even 1 case of
cholera is an epidemic," he said.
Five people were admitted at the country's major referral hospital, Mulago
Hospital, where a special unit was set up to handle cholera cases. The
first case in the city was reported on 4 Nov 2006. He said the state of
hygiene in most of the slums around Kampala where the reported cases
originated from was very poor and urged residents there to be extra careful.
The country's ministry of health has warned the public to be on the alert
and report any suspected cases to the nearest health unit.

The soaring cholera prevalence in Arua has claimed lives of 7 residents and
left 176 others hospitalized, health officials and political leaders have said.
Ms Norah Fuathum, the town health inspector, on Fri, 11 Nov 2006 said the
epidemic had mostly ravaged River Oli Division in the
municipality. According to the up-dated health bulletin, 130 dwellers in
Oli had contracted cholera since the epidemic re-emerged in the urban
neighborhood on 12 Jul 2006.
River Oli Division is the most populated area of Arua town with inadequate
sanitation facilities and harboring mainly people with modest means.
"The continued prevalence of cholera means that people are still eating
contaminated food and I cannot understand why," Mr Charles Asiki, the
municipality mayor said.
According to the statistical break down from Oli Health Centre where all
cholera patients are being treated, only 3 cases of the disease were
registered from the urban Arua Hill division. Daily Monitor has learnt
that in Ayivu County, 48 cases of the epidemic have been reported from the
sub-counties of Dadamu, Oluko, Pajulu and Manibe over the last 4 months.
