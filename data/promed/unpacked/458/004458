Health officials are suspecting that the 7 children who fell ill in Doraguda village under Laxmipuram Panchayat of Munchingiput mandal in Alluri Sitarama Raju (ASR) district might have been infected with anthrax. Officials sent the blood samples to the King George Hospital at Visakhapatnam for tests.

"The tribals of the remote village on the Andhra Odisha Border (AOB) had consumed the meat of a dead cattle 10 days ago. After this, 7 children showed symptoms of anthrax," officials said. Officials said the staff of the PHC at Labburu identified the suspected symptoms of anthrax among these children at a medical camp held at a weekly shandy in Laxmipuram. [A shandy is an agricultural market organised by farmers. - Mod.MHJ]

Additional district medical and health officer of ASR district Dr Leela Prasad and others visited the affected village by trekking the hilly terrain to take stock of the situation. "We have collected the samples and sent them to KGH. We have administered prophylactic doses of antibiotics to all the villagers. The health staff will do the follow-up for 7 more days," she said.

[I suspect that these children have cutaneous anthrax from carrying the raw contaminated meat home from the shandy. Cutaneous anthrax is readily diagnosed and carries a modest mortality risk. On the other hand, gastro-enteric anthrax is very severe and frequently lethal.

The best samples to take are swabs of the lesion or of the bloody fluid under the lesion, which can be extracted by a hypodermic syringe. The vegetative cells in a blood sample will not survive more than 3 days, so cultures will be negative no matter how competent the laboratory. Even so, we hope that there is a follow-up on this outbreak and on the nature of the livestock source and any veterinary actions.

"Alluri Sitharama Raju district, also known as Alluri district and by its initials as ASR district, is a district in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. The headquarters of the district is located at Paderu. Named after Alluri Sitarama Raju, a revolutionary in the Indian independence movement who hailed from the region, the district was effective since 4 Apr 2022 and became one of the 26 districts in the state."
