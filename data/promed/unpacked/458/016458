Great apes at risk from Ebola virus
-----------------------------------
Some scientists believe that Ebola virus may have killed thousands of apes
in the last few years. The warning comes from the World Conservation Union
(IUCN), which represents 10 000 government and non-government scientists
from 180 countries. Dr William Karesh, of the US Wildlife Conservation
Society (WCS), co-chairs the veterinary specialist group of IUCN's Species
Survival Commission. He believes that the Ebola outbreak in the Republic of
the Congo has affected tens of thousands of square kilometres over the last
5 or 6 years. In that time it has killed hundreds of people, and Dr Karesh
says there is "a real possibility" that thousands of great apes have also
succumbed. He said: "For years, many of us have been trying to point out
that disease and health (whether wildlife, domestic animals, or human) are
critical factors that have to be included in effective conservation
planning." Dr Jean-Christophe Vie, of IUCN's Species Programme, said:
"Diseases affecting wildlife have not always been properly taken into
account in conservation planning in the past. "Chimpanzees and gorillas are
already endangered, and Ebola virus adds yet another threat to those
already facing these species, such as deforestation and the wild meat trade."
Ebola haemorrhagic fever is described by the World Health Organization as
"one of the most virulent viral diseases known, causing death in 50 to 90
per cent of all clinically ill cases". The virus was confirmed in Congo in
December 2002. Six gorillas, all from one family group which had been
followed by researchers for 10 years, were found dead at the time in a
sanctuary covering roughly 11 000 square kilometres (4250 square miles) in
the north west of the Republic of the Congo, near Gabon. Local people have
been involved in establishing the sanctuary as a protected area to prepare
gorillas for the arrival of tourists. At the end of January 8 gorilla
families were found to have disappeared over the previous 2 months:
conservationists reported what IUCN calls "the quasi-disappearance" of the
species from the sanctuary.
IUCN says primates are especially susceptible to many diseases affecting
humans, apart from Ebola fever, because of their close relationship to us.
It says: "The transmission of Ebola virus from the forest near the affected
villages follows contact between hunters and the carcasses of great apes.
"Infected hunters have reported eating the dead gorillas and chimpanzees
(although it is illegal to do so)." [It should be emphasized that Ebola
virus would be destroyed by normal cooking methods and any transmission of
infection must occur at the time of slaughter and harvesting of meat. - Mod.CP]
Several organisations have been working for some years to monitor the
health of the region's gorillas. They include WCS, Ecofac (Conservation and
Rational Use of Central African Forest Ecosystems), and CIRMF (Primatology
Centre, International Medical Research Institute, Gabon). Dr Karesh said
managing the problem was near-impossible because of the region's
instability. He urged a programme of Ebola research and prevention. Lowland
gorillas, which are classed as endangered, live in tropical rain forests in
the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Republic of the Congo
(Congo-Brazzaville), Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, Cameroon, and the Central
African Republic.
