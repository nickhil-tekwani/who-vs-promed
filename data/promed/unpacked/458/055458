Epidemiological comments This event was not associated with a
visible die-off of finfish. This finding represents a new geographic
location and a new species (brown bullhead, _Ameiurus nebulosus_). On
25 Sep 2010, sick fish were found in Hamilton harbour. The water
temperature at the time of collection was 19 degrees Celsius. 7 adult
brown bullheads were sent to Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) for
diagnostic work up. Another sample, 16 morbid adult brown bullheads,
was submitted to DFO from the same location on 2 Nov 2010. On both
submissions fish had deep ulcers on the head, base of fins and belly.
Histological findings include severe mycotic ulcerative dermatitis and
necrotizing granulomatous sub-acute myositis. Fungal structures were
non-septate with occasional branching hyphae. No reproductive fungal
structures were seen. Ulcerative lesions were also infected with
bacteria.

Control measures
Measures applied:
* Movement control inside the country
* No vaccination
* No treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied Zoning Surveillance outside containment and/or
buffer zone

Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type Freshwater Institute (National laboratory)
Tests and results
Species Brown bullhead (_Ameiurus nebulosus_)
Test histological test
Test date 28 Feb 2011
Result Positive

Species Brown bullhead (_Ameiurus nebulosus_)
Test polymerase chain reaction (PCR
Test date 28 Feb 2011
Result Positive

Future Reporting: The event is resolved. No more reports will be
submitted.

[This is not the 1st report of this disease in Canada, but it is an
expansion of the disease

Epizootic ulcerative syndrome (EUS) is a seasonal epizootic condition
of wild and farmed, fresh- and brackishwater fish. Of complex
infectious aetiology, it is characterized by the presence of invasive
_Aphanomyces_ infection and necrotising ulcerative lesions typically
producing a granulomatous response. The disease is now endemic in
South-east and south Asia, and has recently extended to West Asia. EUS
is indistinguishable from red spot disease of eastern Australia and
mycotic granulomatosis of Japan.

Diagnosis is based on clinical signs and histological evidence of the
typical aggressive invasiveness of the non-septate fungal hyphae,
within the context of high mortality. Isolation of the fungus allows
its characteristic growth profile to be used as an aid to
identification.

Control of EUS in natural waters is probably impossible. In outbreaks
occurring in small, closed water bodies, liming of water and
improvement of water quality, together with removal of infected fish,
is often effective in reducing mortality.

The initial sign is usually mass mortality associated with distinct
dermal lesions including ulcers. Surviving fish typically have lesions
of varying degrees of severity. These may appear as red-spots,
blackish burn-like marks, or deeper ulcers with red centers and white
rims. Some fish, especially snakeheads survive a long time with such
ulcers, which may erode so deeply as to expose the vertebrae, brain
and viscera.

Histological occurrences include necrotizing, granulomatous
dermatitis and myositis associated with invasive, non-septate fungal
hyphae, 10-20 um in diameter. The fungus may penetrate visceral
organs, such as the kidney and liver, after it has spanned the
musculature.

The fungus can be isolated and cultured without difficulty, provided
measures are taken to exclude bacterial and other fungal contaminants.
Besides their typical vulnerability to temperature above 30C, _A
invaderis_ and _A. piscicida_ are very similar to non-pathogenic
opportunistic _Aphanomyces_ spp. that readily contaminate the surface
of affected fish and often interfere with isolation attempts. In the
laboratory, the fungus has also been shown to be pathogenic to a wide
range of fish, inducing similar pathology and mortality under various
predisposing experimental conditions.
