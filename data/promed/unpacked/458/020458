Anthrax outbreak hits northern Alberta
--------------------------------------
Warnings have been issued of an anthrax outbreak in MacKenzie County, northern Alberta, in hot, dry conditions favorable to the disease. Anthrax in grazing cattle was confirmed at 4 pastures and at one bison ranch. Since the 1st report on [14 Jul 2022], 31 cattle and 3 bison have died out of about 1700 endangered animals, a spokesman for the province's Ministry of Agriculture said in an email.

No further deaths have been observed or reported since [2 Aug 2022]. All but 2 producers with about 115 animals have vaccinated their cattle against the disease since the outbreak. Others were in the vaccination process.

According to Alberta Beef Producers, several isolated cases of anthrax occur in western Canada almost every year. Animals become ill by eating infected soil, food, or water, resulting in death within hours. Conditions that increase the risk of soil use -- tillage, drought, and short-cut hay -- may also increase risk.

"Initial symptoms include weakness, depression, difficulty breathing, lack of coordination, lying down and convulsions," ABP said in a statement. "Due to the rapid nature of the disease, death is often the 1st sign producers see."

The group also said vaccination is a good way to protect cattle from anthrax [In fact the only way. - Mod.MHJ]. The disease can be treated with antibiotics if caught early, but antibiotics do not offer long-term protection. Animals should not be treated with antibiotics within 8 days of vaccination.

When anthrax infects a herd, carcasses must be handled with extreme care to avoid additional contamination. "The carcass should be carefully covered and secured to prevent scavengers from accessing the carcass and possibly further spreading the anthrax spores," ABP said. "Incineration is the preferred disposal method. Check with your veterinarian or rural community to find out if incineration is legal in your area and decide on the best fuel, safest way to incinerate, and then clean up properly."

Burial may be an option if cremation isn't an option, but spores can survive in the soil for decades, requiring the carcass to be buried quickly and deep -- 6 to 8 feet [1.8 to 2.4 m]. Be careful in wetlands and do not bury carcasses in flood-prone areas. Write down the coordinates of all burial or cremation sites.

"Do not move or come into direct contact with the carcass unless absolutely necessary," ABP said. "If you have no other choice, wear gloves and long sleeves, cover any open wounds, and wash your hands and arms thoroughly when you're done." Launder exposed clothing and disinfect boots that may have come into contact with contaminated soil."

In a statement, the province said anthrax poses little risk to the general public or food safety.

"Alberta's chief provincial veterinarian is working with local veterinarians to ensure affected animals are properly disposed of and that producers are using other necessary herd management procedures to reduce the risk of spread."

[MacKenzie County is in the NW corner of Alberta and adjoins the Wood Buffalo National Park to its east. (See: https://www.google.com/maps/@58.7615394,-117.1436467,7z?hl=en and https://www.bing.com/maps?q=Mackenzie%20County&satid=id.sid%3A4d841a9f-a4c6-ce37-8b04-306fde7aaa9d). This is an area where the local Indians provide summer grazing for cattle from central & southern Alberta. Anthrax broke out there around 15 years ago with the westerly migration of wood bison from the Peace River Delta, an enzootic hot spot for anthrax.

The wording of this report is somewhat confusing. I suspect that the authors meant that 115 cattle have been vaccinated and the other herds in the area are scheduled to be vaccinated. As it is 3 weeks since the last death was noted, unfortunately the owners may feel that there is no longer any urgency. In the past we have had more specific reporting of what happened where and when in Alberta.

Burning 34 carcasses (31 cattle and 3 bison) is not an easy thing to do, even with the local Hot Shots experts. If you have access to the necessary equipment for digging deep trenches or cattle graves, this would be quicker and easier. As this government-based report avoids such details I suspect that Edmonton does not know what actually happened. - Mod.MHJ
