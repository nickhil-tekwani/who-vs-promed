Unverified Rumors of Viral Hemorrhagic Fever in Democratic Republic of Congo
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The onset of the outbreak of Ebola hemorrhagic fever in Gulu, Uganda has
heightened awareness of viral hemorrhagic fevers in the region. As a
result, WHO has been investigating periodic rumors of similar outbreaks in
the surrounding countries.
In Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), WHO has investigated rumors in
Dungu, Bengadi, Isiro, Buta, Nyankunde and Bunia, and samples have been
negative for Ebola virus.
As part of these ongoing operations, WHO is currently investigating
unverified reports of 2 additional cases for which few clinical details
have been reported, in Bunia, DRC.
The WHO Outbreak Response Team in Gulu has been in contact with WHO Office,
Goma, Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF), Goma and the WHO sub-office in Bunia
regarding these unverified rumors. A WHO surveillance officer at the Bunia
sub-office is investigating the reports. In addition, a team from MSF and
WHO will travel to Bunia early next week. Previously 3 suspected cases were
reported in Bunia, one in early August, one in mid-November and a third in
late-November 2000. WHO investigations demonstrated that these rumors were
unfounded.
