Human Plague Case Confirmed in Santa Fe County
----------------------------------------------
The New Mexico Department of Health announced today, 23 Sep 2015, a laboratory-confirmed case of plague in a 73-year-old woman from Santa Fe County. The case was confirmed at the Department of Health's Scientific Laboratory Division. This is the 4th human case of plague in New Mexico in 2015 and the 2nd in Santa Fe County. The woman was hospitalized and is back home recovering. The other cases in the state occurred in a 52-year-old woman from Santa Fe County, who died from the illness, and in a 65-year-old man and a 59-year-old woman, both from Bernalillo County, who have recovered.

"This is the 4th case of plague in New Mexico with the patient presenting clinical signs of septicemic plague," said Department of Health Secretary Retta Ward, MPH. "Though septicemic plague is less common and harder to recognize than the more common form of bubonic plague, health care providers need to consider plague in their diagnosis when the patient has a fever of unknown origin and when the patient is from plague endemic areas of the state."

Septicemic plague accounts for approximately 20-25 percent of New Mexico cases. No detectable swollen lymph node (bubo) is found.

Plague is a potentially fatal illness in people that occurs in many parts of New Mexico. It is caused by a bacterium found in rodents, especially ground squirrels, rabbits and pack rats. Most human cases of plague are acquired through the bite of infected fleas. Dogs and cats are also susceptible to plague and are infected either through bites of infected fleas or by eating an animal that has died from the disease.

"Several of our plague cases in 2015 have most likely been exposed to plague-infected rodent fleas brought into the home and bedroom by dogs and cats that are allowed to roam and hunt and aren't treated with a flea control product, said Paul Ettestad, state public health veterinarian with the Department of Health.

In addition to the 4 human cases, there have been 8 cases of plague in 2015 in dogs and cats, including pets from Bernalillo, Santa Fe, and Torrance counties.

[This continues to be a "banner year" for _Yersinia pestis_ infections in the USA with 15 cases and 4 deaths. In recent decades, an average of 7 human plague cases have been reported each year (range: 1-17 cases per year) with 0-2 deaths.

The following was extracted from Prentice MB, Rahalison L: Plague. Lancet. 2007; 369(9568): 1196-207, with the citations removed:

"Some plague cases (10-25 percent) present with primary septicemia (hypotension, shock) without lymph nodes being obviously affected and these patients have higher mortality than those with bubonic plague. The term septicemic plague can be confusing, since most patients with buboes have detectable bacteremia at some stage and can also have high-density bacteremia with systemic signs of sepsis. Debate about whether septicemic plague is always secondary to frank or subclinical bubonic or pneumonic disease continues, but work in mice lends support to the existence of a syndrome of septicemic disease without histological changes in lymph nodes in a few animals infected by flea bites."
