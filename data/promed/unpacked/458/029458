[This is the 24th reported case of rabies in northern Greece since 15 Oct 2012, when the surveillance was launched. So far, 20 red foxes, 3 dogs (including the one reported in the current notification) and one cat have been found rabid.

An accumulated report, including a map indicating the locations and affected animal species in each event, is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000013677_20130627_155427.pdf.

Control of the disease in Greece, which has been regarded free of rabies for decades, will be feasible only if coordinated with neighbouring, rabies-endemic countries. - Mod.AS
