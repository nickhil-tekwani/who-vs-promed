1st report of _Globodera pallida_ in Denmark
--------------------------------------------
In Denmark, official inspections, soil sampling and testing for the presence of potato cyst nematodes (_Globodera rostochiensis_ and _G. pallida_, both EPPO A2 List) have been regularly carried out by the NPPO [National Plant Protection Organisation]. These official surveys are conducted in all fields proposed for seed potato production and in a selected range of ware potato fields. In addition, outdoor plant nurseries are officially tested for the presence of potato cyst nematodes before they enter production.

For the last 25 years prior to 2012, _G. pallida_ had never been found in Denmark. However in 2012, _G. pallida_ was detected for the 1st time in 4 ware potato fields (belonging to 2 growers) in the south western part of Denmark. These 2 outbreaks are currently under eradication.

[Both golden (_Globodera rostochiensis_, with at least 5 races) and pale (_G. pallida_) potato cyst nematodes (PCNs) cause serious crop losses in potato. Other solanaceous crops (such as tomato) and weeds may serve as pathogen reservoirs. PCN symptoms on potato include stunting, yellowing, and wilting of leaves as well as a reduced root system. PCNs may lead to complete crop failure. Diseased plants first occur in isolated patches and these become larger with each new crop.

The nematodes can survive in soil for up to 20 years as cysts. Spread occurs via infected soil, water, wind, or on plant material. Disease management includes exclusion, long crop rotation with non-host species, use of crop cultivars resistant to specific PCN races, and nematicides. These control measures can be combined to keep nematode levels below economic thresholds. Both PCNs have been included on the quarantine lists of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO).

In the Eurasian area, golden PCN is widespread but pale PCN has a more restricted distribution and its report in Denmark is of significance to the region.
