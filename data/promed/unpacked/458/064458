The WHO/FAO Collaborating Center for Reference and Research on
Leptospirosis, Brisbane, Queensland Health Scientific Services had been
involved with the Ministry of Health, Palau Region and the CDC, Atlanta
from 1995 to 1999 investigating leptospirosis in the Palau region. Case
control studies of selected households had been conducted to establish
incidence rates and also asymptomatic infections.

Up to 1999 the reference laboratory had tested over 2000 human and animal
sera to gain the true incidence of the disease in the Palau communities.
Isolates were also recovered from human and animal sources. This
investigation identified the key infecting serovars for the region most
likely to be causing human leptospirosis. Likely sources for the disease
were also able to be determined. Serological tests conducted for the region
by the reference laboratory were by MAT and the ELISA. The sera were tested
against a panel of 21 serovars.
Local health authorities should ensure that any screen test positives are
tested against the Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT) and against a
serovar panel representative of the region. The MAT will assist in
confirming the leptospirosis diagnosis by excluding false positives.
Isolates recovered from the region would be useful for inclusion in the MAT
panel and provide a more definitive result. We are happy to make these
isolates available to a testing laboratory.
