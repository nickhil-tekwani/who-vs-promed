Killer algae target fish in Arizona lakes; experts working to prevent spread
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thousands of fish in 11 area lakes have gone belly up, as
swift-killing algae have engulfed waters and choked out lake
inhabitants.
There have been 8 reported cases of golden algae killing fish in
urban lakes, and the microorganism has seeped into Saguaro, Apache
and Canyon lakes, Larry Riley, Arizona Game and Fish Department
fisheries chief, said on Friday [27 May 2005].
Experts have been scrambling to rid waters from Gilbert to Phoenix of
the deadly algae. "We've been really busy trying to track this stuff,
where it's popped up," Riley said.
Golden algae, or _Prymnesium parvum_, secrete toxins that attack
exposed cells in fish gills, causing inflammation, hemorrhaging and
eventual suffocation. The algae, which have troubled western Texas
waters for 2 decades, thrive in cooler temperatures and have killed
fish weighing up to 50 pounds.
Golden algae post some health threats to humans if infected fish are
eaten, according to the Texas Department of Health. It also causes
ecological damage by how fast it spreads. "Algae, literally, can
double and triple [in quantity] in 24 hours," said Rick Amalfi, vice
president of Aquatic Consulting and Testing, a state-licensed
laboratory and water-consulting firm in Tempe that has been flooded
with water samples from private lake managers in recent months. "It
just spreads everywhere, . . . and that's where you get the
devastating kills."
Some believe the algae were either hibernating or simply had gone
undetected in Arizona. "We had been overlooking this species for
years. It may have been here for longer," Amalfi said.
The algae were 1st identified in Gilbert in March 2005, where they
wiped out more than 1000 trout, bass and catfish in the Riparian
Preserve at Water Ranch's 5-acre lake. Arizona Game and Fish
officials say it was the 1st appearance of golden algae in Arizona.
Soon after, algae were detected in Saguaro Lake and recently spread
to nearby Apache and Canyon lakes, Riley said.
While the devastation is greatest in the smaller lakes, those waters
can be treated with chemicals, including copper-based algaecides.
Officials detected the algae in Phoenix's Cortez Lake earlier this
month [May 2005], began immediate algacide treatments and prevented
an outbreak.
"If you can find this thing, detect it early, there are chemicals and
algaecides that can be used to knock this thing back," said Eric
Swanson, Arizona Game and Fish urban fisheries manager. However,
massive reservoirs like Saguaro, Apache and Canyon present different
problems, because workers are limited in performing large-scale
chemical treatments, Riley said.
The widespread fish deaths could have some economic and
quality-of-life impacts. Over the past 5 years in Texas, 20 million
fish have died, and officials have spent about USD 1 million annually
to research the algae, said Phil Durocher, director of inland
fisheries for Texas Parks and Wildlife. Fish hatcheries have also
lost millions of dollars because waters were infected, Durocher said.
Riley said the economic impact in Arizona could be "significant,"
particularly at smaller lakes that heavily rely on fishing to draw
people. However, there are still "thousands and thousands" of fish in
the larger reservoirs for anglers, he said. "Yeah, it's a problem.
(But) it shouldn't keep us from going out and recreating. It isn't a
risk to us, health-wise," Riley said.
Officials have been diligently monitoring water systems for several
months now, but experts say the algae can't be fully eliminated.
Amalfi said cooler temperatures in the future would tell whether
officials can control future algae outbreaks. "We'll be kind of
holding our breath this fall," he said.

[Golden algae are estuarine-based (saltwater-tolerant) organisms that
are very small (10 um long x 5 um wide). They are generally oval
shaped with 2 cup-shaped golden plastids running the length of each
side of the cell.
These tiny organisms, when in great number, can cause water to be
discolored, ranging from yellow to coppery brown. They may be present
in mud and cause problems with inland- or pond-raising of fish.
Golden algae do not seem to go away as does red tide.
Large concentrations of golden algae (blooms) can often be toxic to
fish. The toxins affect the gills of the fish, which are the
breathing system, thus limiting the fishes' ability to take in
oxygen. Death is from asphyxiation, just as it is with red tide. -
