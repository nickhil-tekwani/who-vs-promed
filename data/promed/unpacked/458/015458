Mystery disease kills 30 children
----------------------
30 children have died of an undiagnosed disease at Kurdgachi,
Kuchidanga, Kadamtala, Janardanpur, Gabaparda, Balagachi, and
Natundiyara villages in Nasipore area of Lalgola, Murshidabad
district, West Bengal, India, over the last 10 days. Their ages are
between 8 months to 6 years.
About 100 children have been affected by the disease, whose symptoms
include high fever, breathlessness, convulsion, increased salivation,
followed by stiffening of jaws within 5-6 hours of the onset of the
disease and death.

[While the description of a high fever leads to thinking about
possible infectious agents that might be responsible for this
clinical picture, the remainder of the description is less likely to
be an infectious agent. The mention that the course of the illness
is rapid, with duration of time from onset of symptoms to death at
approximately 5-6 hours is suggestive of a possible toxic exposure.
As the age group involved is young children, one wonders about a
possible contamination of milk supplement, perhaps a powdered milk
substitute that may be used. More information on possible exposures
or other epidemiologic features of this outbreak would be
appreciated. - Mods.TG/MPP]
