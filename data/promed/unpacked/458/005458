Listeria outbreak in meat - Factory forces meat goods recall
-----------------------------------------------
Byrnes Quality Meats has recalled part of its smallgoods range after it was
discovered the products contained harmful Listeria bacteria. The products to
be recalled are 250g vacuum packs of sliced beef, pork and lamb, and
silverside, ham, salami and chicken roll.
The contamination is thought to be caused by a Listeria outbreak in the
company's factory in the Atherton Tableland in north Queensland [by which I
suppose they mean contamination rather than an outbreak among the factory
workers. - Mod.JW].
The outbreak may force the company out of the sliced meat business, due to
the financial strains of the recall and the expensive measures for
protection against bacteria such as Listeria. [Strange logic -- surely all
meat processing factories must by law implement protection against microbial
contamination? - Mod.JW]
Listeria is a bacterium capable of causing serious illness in people,
especially the very young, the elderly, and the immunocompromised [and
pregnant women -- it can pass to the fetus in utero. - Mod.JW].

[ProMED would appreciate any further information on this outbreak,
particularly on the extent of distribution of the products, and whether any
cases of illness result -- the median incubation period is estimated to be 3
weeks. - Mod.JW]
