In the rural village of Koktal, East Kazakhstan region, compensation is being paid for dead animals. The head of the region, Danial Akhmetov, wrote about it on his social network page, Sputnik Kazakhstan reports.

Akhmetov noted that he was aware of the situation in the village of Koktal, Urjar district, and a special commission from the region is investigating the situation.

"Now that the quarantine regime has been introduced in the region, security measures have been tightened in the districts and villages. I want to say that whatever the results of the analysis, appropriate assistance will be provided. Livestock losses will be reimbursed," the head of the region said.

To date, 253 dead animals have been registered. Along with the population, 4 farms were affected.

"According to my decision, in the near future we will pay KZT 260 000 [USD 613] per head of cattle, KZT 150 000 [USD 371] per one-year-old animal [born] in 2019, and KZT 50 000 [USD 116] per head of calves [born] this year [2020]," Akhmetov added.

It's worth noting that earlier it was reported that cattle died due to unknown reasons in Koktal rural district of Urjar district. Employees of the East Kazakhstan regional territorial veterinary inspection and the veterinary department of the regional akimat are conducting a study.

[According to information received from a reliable source, and as stated and shown by the Kazakh TV (a video clip may be shared through whatsapp upon request), the animals reportedly manifested drooling during 1-2 days prior to death.

Acute death in cattle of all ages may be caused by infectious and non-infectious (e.g., toxicological) agents; it may also have an iatrogenic etiology. Gross pathological changes are of particular interest to exclude rinderpest (not likely, in the absence of diarrhea); lab and epidemiological investigation results are anticipated with interest.

Koktal, a village, in the East Kazakhstan region, is situated about 58 km [36 mi] distant from China's border to its east (map at https://tinyurl.com/y7oc8f6l. - Mod.AS]
