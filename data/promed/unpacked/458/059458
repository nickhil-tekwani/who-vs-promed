A Response to Michael Silvers' Comment
---------------------------------------
According to the CDC press release, [See:
<http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/pressrel/r010702.htm>
_Aedes albopictus_ (AKA, tiger mosquito) is "...not widely seen in the
United States".... and... "...a species previously not seen in California."
Perhaps Michael Silvers has data they should review?
For the epidemiologically curious: The tiger mosquito is a voracious biter
and can effectively transmit many viral agents that are not normally
indigenous to Canada and the United States but are potentially harmful to
humans and animals. In addition, the mosquito can transmit viral diseases
that already exist in Canada and the U.S., such as Eastern Equine
encephalitis, Western Equine encephalitis, and La Crosse encephalitis,
which can cause disease in humans and animals.

A Second Response
-----------------
Is someone going to answer Mr. Silvers' question on the logic of import
embargo re _Aedes albopictus_? Perhaps the embargo logic entails a worry
that the foreign-born mosquitos are carrying a "foreign" disease. We are
all still wondering just "how" West Nile virus entered the USA.

[Michael Silvers' questioning of the logic of the embargo on importation of
_Dracaena_ spp. plants in standing water, because of risk of introduction
of _Ae. albopictus_ mosquitoes was posted as "Ae. albopictus, imported -
USA (Oregon) (02) 20010813.1914." Unless there is a response from the
instigators of the embargo, this thread is now cut. - Mod.CP
