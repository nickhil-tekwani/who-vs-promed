Rabbit hem. dis. virus introduced - New Zealand (07) (not yet archived)]
30 August 1997
The New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture has received the first confirmed
positive laboratory result for rabbit calicivirus disease (RCD) in the
Canterbury area. One dead rabbit from near Culverden, north of Christchurch,
has tested positive for the disease. This is the most northern result to
date. The disease is now widespead in the McKenzie basin and Central Otago.
There have been no confirmed cases of RCD in the North Island, and aeriel and
ground surveillance has found nothing unusual, although some farmers have
reported releasing the virus in rabbit prone areas of the North Island.
MAF REASSURES PET OWNERS:
The New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture is advising pet owners worried
about the possible effects of rabbit calicivirus disease on their pets not
to worry.
Chief Veterinary Officer Dr Barry O'Neil said RCD had existed in more than
40 overseas countries - mainly in Europe - for more than a decade, and had
been on the Australian mainland for nearly two years. "During that time,
we are not aware of any reports of animals other than European rabbits
getting sick, let alone dying, after killing and eating rabbits suspected
to have died of the disease."
Dr O'Neil said these overseas reports indicate the risk from fresh rabbit
meat is extremely low, and the risk from processed commercial petfood is
even lower. "I therefore believe that, although we can never realistically
say that the chance of any disease crossing species is absolute zero, the
risk from RCD is so low that it can be considered safe. The risk is
certainly lower than for some other viruses currently in New Zealand, such as
parvovirus and distemper - or indeed of a dog or cat being run over crossing
the road."
However, Dr O'Neil cautioned pet owners against feeding to their pets dead
rabbits which had died from RCD. "I say this simply because it is always
unwise to feed the carcass of any animal which has died of any disease to
another animal, because of the risk of bacterial contamination."
Dr O'Neil recommended concerned owners of pet rabbit get their animals
vaccinated, particularly those in the South Island. The disease has not been
confirmed in the North Island at this stage, although there had been reports
that farmers in some rabbit prone areas in the North Island have released the
virus on their properties.
Vaccinations are available through and must be administered by registered
veterinarians.
