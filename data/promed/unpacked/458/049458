With 4 deaths, the toll of Japanese encephalitis [virus; JEV] victims
has now been raised to 379 in the northern Indian state of Uttar
Pradesh, a senior Indian Health official said Saturday. "A total of
2182 patients suffering from the deadly vector-borne disease were
admitted to Baba Raghav Das Medical College in the recent past in
Gorakhpur in the eastern part of the state. According to latest
reports, 379 patients have died so far this year. The condition of
some patients are also serious and the toll may mount," the official said.

[The death toll continues to climb from 356 reported in ProMED
archive 20091001.3420 to 379 currently in the Gorakhpur area of Uttar
Pradesh. This report does not indicate if these cases were laboratory
confirmed as JEV. Previous reports have attributed some of the cases
to JEV infection and others to an acute encephalitis syndrome of
unidentified etiology not caused by JEV. The current report indicates
that the cases are caused by JEV.
