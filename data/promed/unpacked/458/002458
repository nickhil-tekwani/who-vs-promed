Error forces rethink on bird flu risk zone
-----------------------------------------------
* Scientists mistook bird flu infected whooper swan for a native mute swan.
* Migratory whooper swans pose higher risk of spreading infection in UK.
* 600 whooper swans tested for bird flu as authorities consider quarantine.
Key quote: "We are considering that question in our discussions with
ornithologists and epidemiologists. We will take whatever information
we have to consider and introduce a proportionate approach," says
Charles Milne, Scotland's chief veterinary officer.
Sweeping new bird flu restrictions may have to be imposed across
large parts of Britain after scientists discovered they had wrongly
identified the type of swan found dead in Fife the Scottish Executive
admitted yesterday [11 Apr 2006].
DNA tests on the bird showed that, rather than being a resident mute
swan, as officials 1st believed, it was a migratory whooper swan,
which may have carried the disease around the UK. The mistake was
blamed on the creature's state of decomposition. Urgent discussions
are taking place to establish whether the government needs to upgrade
its risk assessment.
According to Ross Finnie, the Scottish environment minister, the
initial confusion over the species recovered from Cellardyke harbor
was caused by the extent of decomposition and the fact that it had
been partly eaten by other animals so that the head was missing. Once
tests confirmed it had the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain of bird flu,
samples were sent for DNA testing, which revealed it was a whooper
swan. There are believed to be more than 8000 whooper swans scattered
around Britain over-wintering after flying in from Iceland, Russia
and Scandinavia. Scotland has significant populations around the
Forth and on Loch Leven. More than 600 whooper swans from around
Britain have already been tested for the virus.
The problem facing the government is that it does not know whether
the Cellardyke bird made it to the UK and came into contact with
other birds or died offshore and drifted to land. Experts are split
on the significance of the information. Professor Hugh Pennington, of
Aberdeen University, said it was possible that Britain's 1st case of
H5N1 was a one-off. "This whooper swan probably came from Germany and
may have died off the Scottish coast as it struggled across the sea,"
the leading microbiologist said.
But Bob McCracken, a past-president of the British Veterinary
Association, said it was equally possible that the swan was alive and
infected when it arrived in Britain. If so, he said, "we must accept
that other birds in the Fife area may also have acquired infection.
We need to assume the worst until we can prove otherwise."
Dr Martin Fowlie, of the British Trust for Ornithology, said while it
was possible that the Cellardyke swan wintered on the Continent and
was making its way back to Iceland to breed when it died, it was
equally possible it had reached the UK -- probably wintering in
southern England -- and contracted the virus from another bird before
dying as it moved north.
Yesterday [11 Apr 2006], Scotland's chief vet, Charles Milne, said it
was impossible to say whether the bird had caught the disease in
another country or in the UK. But he said the fact that the swan was
not a native bird was not necessarily good news. "Whooper swans are
long-distance migrants. They potentially move around more than mute
swans," he said. He said the authorities needed more time to consider
the implications of the DNA test results before looking at the
possibility of further restrictions. He said: "We need to consider
the implications and what other measures may be necessary."
After confirmation that the Fife swan had succumbed to the HN51
strain of bird flu
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/en/>,
the authorities set up a 1.8-mile protection zone around Cellardyke
in which birds were to be tested, a 6-mile surveillance zone in which
the movement of poultry was restricted and a
1000-square-mile-wild-bird risk area in which bird owners were told
to keep flocks indoors.
Asked whether there was a need for similar restrictions in other
parts of the country where whooping swans over-wintered, Mr. Milne
said: "We are considering that question in our discussions with
ornithologists and epidemiologists. We will take whatever information
we have to consider and introduce a proportionate approach." He said
it was difficult to say whether the new information made it more or
less likely that other birds had been infected.

UK's bird tests may be missing flu virus
-----------------------------------------------
When France reported its 1st case of H5N1 bird flu in February 2006,
the UK's response was adamant: samples had been taken from more than
3500 wild birds, and those tested so far showed the disease was not
yet in the UK. Additional precautions, such as moving poultry
indoors, were unnecessary, said the authorities.
Last week, scientists found H5N1 bird flu for the 1st time in the UK,
in a dead swan in Fife, Scotland. The UK's environment ministry DEFRA
again stated that all wild birds tested so far were negative for flu,
so it was unlikely to be widespread. Now, an investigation by New
Scientist suggests that all those tests were flawed, meaning no one
really knows just how widespread infection among British wild birds
might be.
Suspicions have been raised because DEFRA's tests revealed none of
the ordinary flu that ducks and geese normally carry. Of the 3343
fecal samples from wild birds taken for DEFRA by the conservation
group the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (WWT) in December [2005], only
2 were shown to contain low-pathogenicity bird flu (0.06 percent). In
a parallel study for DEFRA conducted by hunters, bird flu was found
in only 3 of 423 freshly shot ducks, or 0.7 percent. "We thought
there was an unusually low level," says Ruth Crommie of the WWT, "but
perhaps that happens in some bird populations."
Flu experts contacted by New Scientist disagree. "There's something
wrong with those numbers," says Bjorn Olsen of the University of
Kalmar in Sweden, who tests up to 10 000 wild birds per year in
Europe's biggest monitoring program for avian flu. Normally, he says,
around 10 percent of dabbling ducks and one percent of geese should
be carrying low-pathogenicity bird flu in Europe in December.
Richard Slemmons of Ohio State University in Columbus has tested 2000
to 3000 water birds per year for 20 years. His chief technician,
Jacqueline Nolting, told New Scientist that "at least 6 or 7 percent
should be positive" at any time.
The problem may have been DEFRA's method of collecting samples.
Crommie says DEFRA told WWT samplers to moisten a sterile swab on a
stick with saline, take a fecal sample from the bird, then put the
swab back in its dry plastic tube. The tubes were then kept at
refrigerator temperature and taken to the testing laboratories the
next day.
Both Nolting and Olsen are adamant that swabs must be immediately
immersed in a saline or preservative solution, and also frozen
quickly. "If you left a swab in the refrigerator in its sheath like
that, it would dry out and you'd lose all your virus," says Olsen. He
says whoever planned the tests "should have talked to us." DEFRA has
not done large-scale flu surveys before.
"If you just want to identify the viruses present, you could put it
in a nutrient solution or in ethanol, but you need a transport
medium," says Nolting. "We never take dry swabs." Both groups also
quickly freeze samples.
DEFRA declined to comment on whether its sampling method would
deliver intact virus to the testing labs. It says different results
in previous surveys "did not invalidate the present survey."
Meanwhile, Olsen says H5N1 was most likely carried to the UK by
migratory ducks, which could have spread the virus to wintering
grounds all over the country. DEFRA's tests would probably not have
picked it up.

[It will be interesting to compare UK surveillance data with those
available on the Danish and German national websites (see
20060412.1085). Unfortunately, the data of the UK surveillance in
wild birds could not be traced on the DEFRA or VLA websites. If this
moderator has missed available data, he will be glad to stand
corrected. - Mod.AS]
[One must emphasize that migratory birds are just one of the routes
by which H5N1 travels. Commercial poultry traveling whole or in part
are still held to be a higher economic risk. - Mod.MHJ]
