Parkinson's disease or parkinsonism have been described after infections by viruses, such as influenza A, Epstein-Barr virus, varicella zoster, hepatitis C virus, HIV, Japanese encephalitis virus, or West Nile virus. We report a patient with probable Parkinson's disease, who was diagnosed after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.

A 45-year-old Ashkenazi-Jewish man was hospitalised in Samson Assuta Ashdod University Hospital (Ashdod, Israel) on 17 Mar 2020 because of dry cough and muscle pain. A few days before admission, he had also noticed a loss of smell. His symptoms had started on 11 Mar 2020, 2 days after returning to Israel from a week-long trip to the USA. He might have been exposed to the virus on the flight back to Israel, as he recalled that a passenger sitting behind him was coughing repeatedly. His previous medical history included hypertension, treated daily with 200 mg labetalol, 80 mg valsartan, and 5 mg amlodipine, and asthma, treated with salbutamol sporadically and at admission. He was found positive for SARS-CoV-2 by use of a real-time RT-PCR test after a nasopharyngeal swab was done on the day of admission. His complete blood count and CRP measures were normal (CRP 1.5 mg/L).

During his hospitalisation in the COVID-19 ward, the patient had fatigue, shortness of breath, and chest pain without fever, and was treated for 3 days as an inpatient, mostly with salbutamol inhalations as needed for mild asthma symptoms, with no need for systemic medications, oxygen supplementation, or mechanical ventilation. The patient was then isolated on 20 Mar 2020 in a COVID-19 facility. He tested negatively on nasopharyngeal swabs done on 25 Mar 2020 and 30 Mar 2020. However, during the isolation period of 3 weeks, he noticed that his handwriting had changed and become smaller and less readable than previously. He started having difficulties speaking and writing text messages on his mobile phone. He also had episodes of tremor in his right hand. After returning home, he continued to have these symptoms and was eventually admitted to the Department of Neurology at Shaare Zedek Medical Center (Jerusalem, Israel) about 2 months after initially testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We diagnosed parkinsonism, meeting the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale criteria for the diagnosis of probable Parkinson's disease.

Parkinson's disease is often preceded by anosmia, which is a common feature of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Immune activation in the olfactory system might eventually lead to the misfolding of alpha-synuclein and the development of Parkinson's disease. This mechanism is supported by post-mortem studies, showing increased levels of TNF, IL1, and IL6. Moreover, patients with Parkinson's disease had an elevated CSF antibody response to seasonal coronaviruses, compared with age-matched healthy controls.

In Ashkenazi-Jewish people with Parkinson's disease, about one-third are carriers of either a GBA or a LRRK2 mutation. A genetic analysis for these mutations and 62 other mutations associated with the disease was negative, and our patient had no previous family history of Parkinson's disease. However, we cannot exclude an interaction between other, less frequent mutations and SARS-CoV-2.

The temporal association between the episode of SARS-CoV-2 infection and parkinsonian symptoms, which appeared during the acute infection, is intriguing. Before his admission to the Department of Neurology, the patient had tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 on real-time RT-PCR on 2 occasions; however, he was then found positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in serum but negative for these antibodies in CSF. Nonetheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 entered the CNS, particularly in view of the olfactory involvement and borderline pleocytosis.

Experts warn coronavirus may cause "wave" of neurological conditions, including Parkinson's disease.

Key points:
- Researchers are warning some well-known COVID-19 symptoms indicate there may be long-term neurological impacts of the disease.
- There is a fear a "silent wave" of Parkinson's disease will follow the COVID-19 pandemic, as it did after the Spanish flu in the early 20th century.
- Medical experts have designed a smell test to improve the early detection of Parkinson's disease and treatment options.

COVID-19 can cause worrying neurological symptoms like a loss of smell and taste, but Australian scientists are warning the damage the virus causes to the brain may also lead to more serious conditions such as Parkinson's disease. It has happened before. Five years after the Spanish flu pandemic in the 1910s, there was up to a 3-fold increase in the incidence of Parkinson's disease.

Kevin Barnham from the Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health said he believed a similar "silent wave" of neurological illness would follow this pandemic. "Parkinson's disease is a complex illness, but one of the causes is inflammation, and the virus helps to drive that inflammation," he said. "Once the inflammation gets into the brain, it starts a cascade of events which can ultimately lead to Parkinson's disease.

Researchers outlined their concerns in a study published in the Journal of Parkinson's Disease. The process is known as the "2-hit hypothesis". The brain gets inflamed from something like a virus, then something else comes along later causing more damage and eventually Parkinson's disease develops. "Evidence is already suggesting the triggers for Parkinson's disease are there with this virus," Professor Barnham said.

Medical experts said it was too early to know how many people who had COVID-19 would go on to develop the disease. "I believe the risk is real," Professor Barnham said. "We can't put a number on it, but with 30 million people worldwide affected by this virus, even a small shift in the risk of getting Parkinson's would lead to many more people being diagnosed. "We know COVID-19 has short-term effects, but we are realising more about the potential long-term effects."

Six million people worldwide have Parkinson's disease, and the figure is expected to double in the next 20 years. "Add to that the silent wave from COVID, and those numbers will explode and there will be serious societal and economic consequences from that," Professor Barnham said.

Extract:
The third "wave" of the COVID-19 pandemic
There may be a myriad of potential long-term neurological and neuropsychiatric complications secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection, including a potential link to worsening parkinsonism in patients with Parkinson's disease and possibly even delayed neurological effects including parkinsonism. It remains to be seen whether COVID-19 viral infections will be later linked to parkinsonism as is the case in other viruses. Also, unlike many neurological conditions, such as neuropathy, there are emerging tools available to identify parkinsonism early in the disease process. As such, this review serves as a "call to arms" for the neurology community in preparation of a potential wave of parkinsonism to come.

Abstract
--------
This Viewpoint discusses insights from basic science and clinical perspectives on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)/severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the brain, with a particular focus on Parkinson's disease. Major points include that neuropathology studies have not answered the central issue of whether the virus enters central nervous system neurons, astrocytes or microglia, and the brain vascular cell types that express virus have not yet been identified. Currently, there is no clear evidence for human neuronal or astrocyte expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the major receptor for viral entry, but ACE2 expression may be activated by inflammation, and a comparison of healthy and infected brains is important. In contrast to the 1918 influenza pandemic and avian flu, reports of encephalopathy in COVID-19 have been slow to emerge, and there are so far no documented reports of parkinsonism apart from a single case report. We recommend consensus guidelines for the clinical treatment of Parkinson's patients with COVID-19. While a role for the virus in causing or exacerbating Parkinson's disease appears unlikely at this time, aggravation of specific motor and non-motor symptoms has been reported, and it will be important to monitor subjects after recovery, particularly for those with persisting hyposmia.

[See URL above for full report and references. This paper presents a different perspective on viral causation of parkinsonism, concluding there is little evidence for causation of this disorder by SARS-CoV-2. But it seems like evidence is mounting for this rare occurrence, where Parkinson's symptoms appear relatively quickly after infection. As time goes on, we may see more Parkinson's disease (PD) following apparent recovery. But it may be difficult to identify causation since the incidence of Parkinson's is increasing. Mayo Clinic researchers reported in a study in JAMA Neurology the incidence of PD and parkinsonism increased significantly in 30 years from 1976 to 2005 (Savica R, Grossardt BR, Bower JH, et al. Time trends in the incidence of Parkinson disease. JAMA Neurol. 2016; 73(8): 981-9. https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2529538). The authors of this perspective rightfully conclude, "It will be important to follow up and clinically monitor patients infected by COVID-19 virus, particularly those who developed specific neurological disturbances, such as sustained hyposmia, syncope, and persistent confusion, given the relevance of these conditions to PD and PD dementia." - Mod.LK]

[D] Viral etiology of Parkinson's review

Despite over 200 years since its 1st description by James Parkinson, the cause(s) of most cases of Parkinson's disease (PD) are yet to be elucidated. The disparity between the current understanding of PD symptomology and pathology has led to numerous symptomatic therapies, but no strategy for prevention or disease cure. An association between certain viral infections and neurodegenerative diseases has been recognized, but largely ignored or dismissed as controversial, for decades. Recent epidemiological studies have renewed scientific interest in investigating microbial interactions with the central nervous system (CNS). This review examines past and current clinical findings and overviews the potential molecular implications of viruses in PD pathology.

Despite over 2 centuries of investigation, the cause(s) of most cases of PD are still unknown. Epidemiological studies suggest there is a gene-environment interaction involved in the development of sporadic/idiopathic PD (iPD). Previous studies suggest a correlation between iPD development and exposure to pesticides or heavy metals, traumatic brain injury, and viral/bacterial infection. The purpose of this review is to revisit historical conclusions, provide a comprehensive update on recent clinical findings, and overview of the potential molecular and cellular implications of neurotropic viruses in PD pathology.

The 1st suggestion of a relationship between viral infections and PD was the 1920-1930s influenza epidemic, which was associated with encephalitis lethargica (EL). Since the EL epidemic, numerous cases of post-encephalitic Parkinsonism (PEP) after certain viral infections (H5N1, coxsackie virus, Japanese encephalitis B., St. Louis viral encephalopathy, and HIV) have been reported, but these cases of Parkinsonism often do not exhibit the same cellular or molecular pathologies as seen in PD and are suggested to be "phenocopies" of PD. Although these acute cases of viral infection did not present with classical PD, these findings (along with the believed EL association with PD) led to multiple clinical studies in the late 1970s and early 1980s investigating the relationship between viral infections and PD. Studies examining the relationship between viruses and PD are detailed in Table 1 [see Table at source URL above].

Further investigation of viral infections (specifically HSV-I and influenza A) should be conducted to determine if intervention can suppress the long-term consequences in the CNS and possibly mitigate the association between viral infections and incidence of PD.

Summary
------
What is already known about this topic?
Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a rare but severe complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and adolescents. Since June 2020, several case reports and series have been published reporting a similar multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults (MIS-A).

What is added by this report?
Cases reported to CDC and published case reports and series identify MIS-A in adults, who usually require intensive care and can have fatal outcomes. Antibody testing was required to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection in approximately one-third of 27 cases.

What are the implications for public health practice?
Clinical suspicion and indicated SARS-CoV-2 testing, including antibody testing, might be needed to recognize and treat adults with MIS-A. Further research is needed to understand the pathogenesis and long-term effects of this condition. Ultimately, the recognition of MIS-A reinforces the need for prevention efforts to limit spread of SARS-CoV-2.

---
During the course of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, reports of a new multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) have been increasing in Europe and the USA (1-3). Clinical features in children have varied but predominantly include shock, cardiac dysfunction, abdominal pain, and elevated inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, D-dimer, and interleukin-6 (1). Since June 2020, several case reports have described a similar syndrome in adults; this review describes in detail 9 patients reported to CDC, 7 from published case reports, and summarizes the findings in 11 patients described in 3 case series in peer-reviewed journals (4-6). These 27 patients had cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, dermatologic, and neurologic symptoms without severe respiratory illness and concurrently received positive test results for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or antibody assays indicating recent infection. Reports of these patients highlight the recognition of an illness referred to here as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults (MIS-A), the heterogeneity of clinical signs and symptoms, and the role for antibody testing in identifying similar cases among adults. Clinicians and health departments should consider MIS-A in adults with compatible signs and symptoms. These patients might not have positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR or antigen test results, and antibody testing might be needed to confirm previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Because of the temporal association between MIS-A and SARS-CoV-2 infections, interventions that prevent COVID-19 might prevent MIS-A. Further research is needed to understand the pathogenesis and long-term effects of this newly described condition.

[...The] working MIS-A case definition used in this report included the following 5 criteria: 1) a severe illness requiring hospitalization in a person aged 21 years or older; 2) a positive test result for current or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection (nucleic acid, antigen, or antibody) during admission or in the previous 12 weeks; 3) severe dysfunction of one or more extrapulmonary organ systems (e.g., hypotension or shock, cardiac dysfunction, arterial or venous thrombosis or thromboembolism, or acute liver injury); 4) laboratory evidence of severe inflammation (e.g., elevated CRP, ferritin, D-dimer, or interleukin-6); and 5) absence of severe respiratory illness (to exclude patients in which inflammation and organ dysfunction might be attributable simply to tissue hypoxia). Patients with mild respiratory symptoms who met these criteria were included.

Cases in 9 patients reported to CDC (Table 1) and 7 published case reports (Table 2), originating from 7 US jurisdictions and the United Kingdom, met the working case definition. The 16 patients ranged in age from 21 to 50 years and included 7 men and 9 women.

Discussion
----------
Findings indicate that adult patients of all ages with current or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection can develop a hyperinflammatory syndrome resembling MIS-C. Although hyperinflammation and extrapulmonary organ dysfunction have been described in hospitalized adults with severe COVID-19, these conditions are generally accompanied by respiratory failure (7). In contrast, the patients described here had minimal respiratory symptoms, hypoxemia, or radiographic abnormalities in accordance with the working case definition, which was meant to distinguish MIS-A from severe COVID-19; only 8 of 16 patients had any documented respiratory symptoms before onset of MIS-A.

The pathophysiology of MIS in both children and adults is currently unknown. Eight of 27 (30%) adults described in this report and 45% of 440 children with MIS-C reported to CDC through 29 Jul 2020 (1) had negative PCR and positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody test results, suggesting MIS-A and MIS-C might represent postinfectious processes. However, in some patients, persistent infection outside the upper respiratory tract is possible; SARS-CoV-2 has been identified in multiple organs, including the heart, liver, brain, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract (7). Additional proposed mechanisms for extrapulmonary dysfunction in COVID-19 include endothelial damage and thromboinflammation, dysregulated immune responses, and dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (7).

The interval between infection and development of MIS-A is unclear, adding to uncertainty regarding whether MIS-A represents a manifestation of acute infection or an entirely postacute phenomenon. In patients with COVID-19, dyspnea is typically experienced a median of 5-8 days and critical illness 10-12 days after onset of symptoms (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-guidance-management-patients.html). In patients who reported typical COVID-19 symptoms before MIS-A onset, MIS-A was experienced approximately 2-5 weeks later. However, 8 MIS-A patients reported no preceding respiratory symptoms, making it difficult to estimate when initial infection occurred.

Given the high proportion of MIS-C patients with negative PCR testing, clinical guidelines recommend the use of both antibody and viral testing to assist with diagnosis (8-10). In patients with atypical or late manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including MIS-A, positive antibody results might be crucial to augment clinical recognition of this condition and guide treatment. In addition, the use of a panel of laboratory tests for inflammation, hypercoagulability, and organ damage (e.g., CRP, ferritin, D-dimer, cardiac enzymes, liver enzymes, and creatinine) might assist in the early identification and management of this COVID-19-associated condition.

All but one of the patients with MIS-A described in this report belonged to racial or ethnic minority groups. Long-standing health and social inequities have resulted in increased risk for infection and severe outcomes from COVID-19 in communities of color (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/health-equity/race-ethnicity.html). MIS-C has also been reported disproportionately in these communities (1). Because patients described in this review represent a convenience sample from a small number of jurisdictions, conclusions cannot be made regarding the true burden or determinants of MIS-A in different groups; further research is needed.

In the process of learning more from MIS-A cases, the working case definition might need to be revised in order to systematically conduct a call for cases. Further research is needed to understand the pathogenesis and long-term effects of this newly described condition. Ultimately, the recognition of MIS-A reinforces the need for prevention efforts to limit spread of SARS-CoV-2.

[Seek and ye shall find. When the description of the case definition for the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) was reported, there was a media report (Washington Post) describing a compatible illness in young adults (see Undiagnosed pediatric inflammatory syndrome (06): COVID-19, heart, young adults 20200522.7364506). My comment at that time was: "Note that the case definition proposed by CDC for this syndrome includes a history of COVID-19 which may influence the proportion of cases with history of COVID-19, and limits the age of presentation to less than 21 years of age. I suspect that like following the 1st announcement of this syndrome, we may move from a 'don't look and it isn't there' surveillance in young adults to a 'seek and ye shall find' surveillance." Clearly that has happened. I would safely say that in 9 months of experience with this virus we've learned a lot, not the least being we have much more to learn about it, and the virus keeps educating us on a daily basis.

- The Americas region reported 37.5% of daily case numbers and 55.4% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, maintaining its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 16.7 million cases. The USA and Brazil remain dominant, followed by Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru. Other countries reporting more than 1000 new cases in the past 24 hours include Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, and Ecuador.

- The European region reported 23.5% of daily case numbers and 13.5% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 6.0 million. Countries not reporting cases today (2 Oct 2020) include Israel, Kazakhstan and Belgium. The dominant country is France, followed by Spain, Russia, the UK, Czech Republic, Ukraine, Netherlands, Germany, Italy, and Romania. Other countries reporting more than 1000 new cases in the past 24 hours include Italy, Poland, Turkey, Hungary, and Republic of Moldova.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 8.0% of daily case numbers and 7.8% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of greater than 2.4 million cases. Morocco is the dominant country, followed by Iraq, Iran, Lebanon, the UAE, Jordan, Pakistan, and Tunisia. Other countries reporting more than 500 new cases but fewer than 1000 include Bahrain, Libya, and Palestinian Authority. Many of these countries had not reported any cases yesterday (1 Oct 2020), so large numbers may reflect 2 days of reports.

- The African region reported 1.3% of daily case numbers and 2.6% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.1 million cases. South Africa is again the dominant country, followed by Ethiopia, Kenya, Algeria, Mozambique, Uganda, Nigeria, Angola, Namibia, and Cabo Verde. However, all reporting countries outside of South Africa reported fewer than 1000 cases.

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.1% of daily case numbers and 1.1% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.61 million cases. The Philippines continues to dominate, followed by Japan, Malaysia, South Korea, and Guam.

- The South East Asia region reported 28.6% of the daily newly reported cases and 19.8% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 7.0 million cases. India continues to dominate followed by Indonesia, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Myanmar.

[The USA, India, and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations, with India in the 2nd position followed by Brazil. In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (77 866), followed by the USA (54 652) and Brazil (33 002) -- account for over half (54.3%) of all confirmed cases globally and 48.7% of all newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, having gone down from 50.4% yesterday (1 Oct 2020). As the daily reports from each of the 3 countries have been dropping, other countries are reporting more newly confirmed cases. A global total of 5541 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (2-3 Oct 2020).

Countries reporting more than 5000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (9 countries) include India, USA, Brazil, Spain (32 200), Argentina (14 687), France (12 148), Russia (9412), UK (6968), and Colombia (6192). A total of 36 countries have reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 14 of the 36 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region and 9 were from the Americas region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is a decrease in case counts by 0.04%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 7.5%.

Impression: While the global 7-day averages appear to have plateaued, when one looks at the country-by-country figures, the 3 major countries -- the USA, India, and Brazil -- have decreased their daily newly confirmed cases, but other countries have increased transmission, especially in Europe and elsewhere in the Americas, with global daily new cases over 350 000. - Mod.MPP]
