- A World Health Organization (WHO) senior leadership team, led by Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, today [28 Jan 2020] met President Xi Jinping of the People's Republic of China in Beijing. They shared the latest information on the outbreak and reiterated their commitment to bring it under control.
- The discussions focused on continued collaboration to improve containment measures in Wuhan, to strengthen public health measures in other cities and provinces, to conduct further studies and transmissibility of the virus, to continue to share data, and for China to share biological material with WHO. These measures will advance scientific understanding of the virus and contribute to developments such as vaccines and treatments https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/28-01-2020-who-china-leaders-discuss-next-steps-in-battle-against-coronavirus-outbreak.
- WHO is launching a Global 2019-nCoV Clinical Data Platform to allow Member States to contribute anonymized clinical data in order to inform the public health clinical response.
- WHO is continually monitoring developments, and the Director-General can reconvene the Emergency Committee on very short notice as needed. Committee members are regularly informed of developments.

Technical Focus - Clinical Management:
Patients with 2019-nCoV infection, are presenting with a wide range of symptoms. Most seem to have mild disease, and about 20% appear to progress to severe disease, including pneumonia, respiratory failure and in some cases death. Clinical care of suspected patients with 2019-nCoV should focus on early recognition, immediate isolation (separation), implementation of appropriate infection prevention and control (IPC) measures and provision of optimized supportive care.

WHO is convening a bi-weekly call with clinical experts around the globe, to better understand, in real time, the clinical presentation and treatment interventions. WHO has published interim clinical care guidance for hospitalized patients and for mildly ill patients at home, and developed a standardized clinical case record form (CRF) that will be available on the website.

To facilitate the aggregation of standardized clinical data, WHO is launching a Global 2019-nCoV Clinical Data Platform to allow Member States to contribute anonymized clinical data in order to inform the public health clinical response. As there is currently no known effective antiviral therapy for 2019-nCoV, the WHO R&D blueprint is conducting a systematic review to evaluate potential therapeutics and develop master clinical protocols that are necessary to accelerate this globally. WHO has also updated the Disease Commodity Package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment, medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV. In addition, a notification was sent out to the Emergency Medical Teams network requesting an expression of interest for clinical operations support teams to support triage, referral systems, clinical care and IPC.

[6] New countries confirming imported cases: UAE, United Arab Emirates; Finland

A family in the United Arab Emirates, arriving from China's central city of Wuhan, has been diagnosed with a case of the new coronavirus, the health ministry said on Wednesday [29 Jan 2020].

It is the 1st known confirmed case in the UAE of a virus that has killed at least 132 people in China. The UAE is a major air transport hub with its Dubai International airport ranked the world's 3rd busiest, and the hub of Emirates airline.

It was not immediately clear how many people had been infected. The ministry of health and the government communications office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Those diagnosed with the virus were in stable condition and under medical observation, the ministry said in a statement carried by state news agency WAM.

The statement did not say where the family was being treated. The UAE is a country of 7 emirates, though the majority of the population lives in Abu Dhabi and Dubai.

Chinese authorities have said the total number of deaths from the flu-like virus has risen by 26 to 132, while the number of confirmed cases has risen by 1459 to a total of 5974.

The number of cases in China now exceeds the 5327 infected there with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus that killed about 800 people worldwide in 2002-2003.

Major UAE airports in Dubai and Abu Dhabi last week said passengers arriving in China would be screened on arrival, a precaution taken by airports elsewhere.

Fears of the spreading virus have already pushed airlines to reduce flights to China. Emirates said on Wednesday [29 Jan 2020] that its flights were operating normally.

Dubai's DP World is among the companies worldwide that have restricted employee travel to China.

[8] Countries evacuating nationals from China - Australia, Japan, USA

https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/evacuated-aussies-to-go-to-christmas-island-for-quarantine/news-story/


Australian travellers, elderly people and children will be evacuated from the coronavirus-stricken city of Wuhan and sent to Christmas Island for quarantine.

Scott Morrison revealed that the government has decided to start evacuations from Wuhan this morning [29 Jan 2020] after the US, South Korea and Japan began their own repatriations.

Qantas will provide the charter planes for the assisted departures, which the Prime Minister said would be on a "last in, 1st out" basis.

Children, elderly people and short-term travellers who have no support base in Wuhan will be prioritised for the flights.

A plane carrying 206 Japanese officials repatriated from Wuhan has now landed in Tokyo, and South Korea says a plane for their citizens [will arrive?] in Wuhan tomorrow.

All Australians rescued would spend 14 days in the Christmas Island processing centre -- famously used for asylum seekers -- for quarantine.

A Qantas spokesman confirmed they were working with the government to bring the Australians home from Wuhan. But he said the Qantas 747 would not be able to land at Christmas Island, so arrangements were still being finalised. That could mean the residents landed in Darwin or Perth and travelled to Christmas Island from there.

[9] Travel advisory for citizens: UK
Date: Tue 28 Jan 2020

https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/china


The FCO continue to advise against all travel to Hubei Province, and now advise against all but essential travel to the rest of mainland China (not including Hong Kong and Macao).

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all travel to Hubei Province due to the ongoing novel coronavirus outbreak. If you're in this area and able to leave, you should do so.

The FCO advise against all but essential travel to the rest of mainland China (not including Hong Kong and Macao). The Chinese government continues to impose further restrictions on movement within China in response to the coronavirus outbreak. It may become harder over the coming weeks for those who wish to leave China to do so. If you feel that you may want to leave China soon, you should consider making plans to do so before any further restrictions may be imposed.

Due to increasing travel restrictions and difficulty accessing medical assistance, the FCO is working to make an option available for British nationals to leave Hubei Province. This may happen quickly and with short notice. If you're a British national in Hubei Province and need assistance, contact our 24/7 number +86 (0) 10 8529 6600 or the FCO in London on (+44) (0)207 008 1500 to register your desire to leave before 29 Jan 2020 at 11am local time. You will be contacted once arrangements are confirmed.

On 23 Jan 2020, the Wuhan authorities closed all transport hubs including airports, railway and bus stations. Some shops and amenities are closed; public events have been cancelled and Chinese authorities have advised the public to avoid crowds. Travel restrictions are also in place in other cities in Hubei Province.

[10] Africa Preparedness
Date: Tue 28 Jan 2020

Across Africa, countries are ramping up airport screenings of passengers arriving from China in efforts to prevent the spread of coronavirus on a continent already facing multiple outbreaks, including Ebola and measles.

This comes amid the 2019-nCoV outbreak, which was 1st reported in a cluster of individuals from Wuhan city, Hubei Province, in China in December 2019 and has since spread across the country and internationally.

While the World Health Organization has refrained from calling the outbreak a global emergency, it is a national emergency in China, with multiple cities shutting down public transportation including railway and airport stations in efforts to curb the spread of the virus, which has now infected over 4000 individuals across the country and killed 106 people, according to the latest report by China's National Health Commission.

"The key message at the moment is there are so many unknowns about the transmission of this virus, so there needs to be a high level of alertness and readiness."

[11] ECDC Statement
Date: Tue 28 Jan 2020
Source: ECDC [edited]
https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/ecdc-statement-following-reported-confirmed-case-2019-ncov-germany


German health authorities confirmed a case of 2019-nCoV in Bavaria on 27 Jan 2020. This brings the cases reported in Europe to 4. The cases in France had a direct link to Wuhan, China.

Based on current information, the infection in Germany followed a close contact with a visitor from China during a stay in Germany (diagnosed with 2019-nCoV after return to China) who had previously been visited by relatives from the Wuhan area. The German authorities are investigating this case and taking the necessary steps to trace and inform any contacts.

At this stage of the on-going outbreak in Hubei province in China, it is likely that there will be more imported cases in Europe. As a consequence, it could be expected to see (limited) local transmission in Europe. A single detected case in Europe does not change the overall picture for Europe, nor does it change the assessment that there is currently a moderate likelihood of importation of cases of 2019-nCoV to the EU/EEA. As more and more cases are reported globally, this also increases the probability of sporadically imported cases to EU/EEA countries.

Based on this, EU/EEA countries should ensure that timely and rigorous infection prevention and control measures (IPC) are applied around any detected nCoV cases in the EU/EEA in order to prevent further spread in the community and healthcare settings. Healthcare workers in the EU/EEA need to be aware and vigilant in order to detect possible nCoV cases early and apply appropriate infection control measures when handling patients.

Right now, the focus still should be on the development of the outbreak in China and the related information on the characteristics of the virus.

The source of infection is unknown and could still be active. Human-to-human transmission has been confirmed, but more information is needed to evaluate the full extent of this mode of transmission and understanding how the virus spreads. As this is a rapidly evolving situation, ECDC is revising its risk assessment for Europe.

Doherty Institute scientists are 1st to grow and share Wuhan coronavirus. This is the 1st time the virus has been grown in cell culture outside of China.

The Royal Melbourne Hospital's Dr Julian Druce, Virus Identification Laboratory Head at the Doherty Institute, said this was a significant breakthrough as it will allow accurate investigation and diagnosis of the virus globally.

The virus was grown from a patient sample that arrived at the Royal Melbourne Hospital's Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory (VIDRL) at the Doherty Institute on Fri 24 Jan [2020].

"We've planned for an incident like this for many, many years, and that's really why we were able to get an answer so quickly," said Dr Catton.

Dr Catton also credited the success to Australia's network of laboratories and public health authorities effectively working together.

"We are very pleased at how it has come together and are glad we were able to respond quickly, which we will continue to do so."
