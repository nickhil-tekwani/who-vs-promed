Wheat farmers told to watch for tan spot
----------------------------------------
Farmers in Canterbury are being advised to keep an eye out for a wheat disease, tan spot, after recent discoveries across the region. Tan spot develops in the stubble of harvested wheat and affects crops when they are replanted over 2 consecutive seasons.

Rob Craigie, Foundation for Arable Research [FAR], said the widespread discovery was a surprise, but it had been found in south and central Canterbury and in Methven over the past 3 seasons.

He said crops under drought or nutrient stress appeared to be more affected, and it could reduce yield by up to half. "It can be quite damaging if the right management or spray program isn't undertaken," he said.

He said the weather had more than likely played a part in the spike of tan spot. "If we have a wetter winter, it will start cycling." But he said there was no way to know why in particular it was being seen more this [2015] season. "It could be that it's just been ticking away for 2 or 3 years and maybe farmers aren't recognising what diseases they've got and it might be expanding that way."

Mr Craigie said the foundation would carry out further work to discover which cultivars were more resistant, but he said good stubble management would help reduce the risk -- including ploughing the stubble, or burning it, before replanting.

[Tan spot (also called yellow leaf spot or blotch) is caused by the fungus _Pyrenophora tritici-repentis_. It affects wheat but can also attack barley, triticale, rye, and some grasses. Tan spot may cause yield losses of up to 50 per cent in favourable environments, especially under minimum tillage systems. Symptoms include characteristic tan leaf lesions with dark centre and yellow surrounds, which may merge to form large necrotic areas; discolouration of glumes and seeds leading to downgrading of grain; and short, spindly plants with reduced tillering and root development. Plants may be fully defoliated soon after flowering. Symptoms are generally seen later in the season in the middle and upper canopy, but young plantlets from infected seed can show leaf spots.

The pathogen survives mainly as dormant mycelium on stubble and crop debris. Wet conditions are necessary for spore production and infection of growing plants resulting in rapid development of the epidemic within a crop. Long distance spread to other crops and areas may occur by strong winds, with infected seed or other plant material. Disease management includes cultural measures (removal of stubble by ploughing or burning, as mentioned above), crop rotation, and fungicides as seed treatments and foliar applications. Host field resistance is poorly understood and many commercial wheat cultivars are susceptible.

The related fungus _Pyrenophora teres_ causes net type (f. _teres_) and spot type (f. _maculata_) of net blotch of domestic and wild barleys (_Hordeum_ spp.).
