A report released on Wednesday [10 Nov 2010] by the Prefecture of Vienne in
France concluded that 500 people, mostly middle school and high school
students in Poitiers, were made ill to varying degrees between 19-22 Oct
2010, after eating hamburgers containing salmonella.

Most are young people from 3 middle schools and a high school in Poitiers
and about 20 people had to be hospitalized.

At Saint-Cyr (Haute-Vienne), 12 cases (7 from Annecy) were identified at a
holiday resort, and a dozen were identified in a nursing home for the elderly.

The investigation, led by the Departmental Direction of Population
Protection, has identified the offending food as a batch of frozen beef
patties produced by an Italian company.
