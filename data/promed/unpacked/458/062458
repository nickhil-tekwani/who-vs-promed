AVIAN INFLUENZA - EURASIA (37): SAUDI ARABIA, FALCON

The 1st confirmed case of avian influenza subtype H5N1 in Saudi
Arabia [earlier than January 2006, probably in December 2005]
involved a saker falcon (_Falco cherrug_) that had been in the
country for the past 2 years. It had a history of anorexia, for 2
days, and passing green feces. The falcon died overnight. A few days
later, it was confirmed that the falcon had died of avian influenza
and had tested positive for H5N1.
The virus might have been introduced from illegally imported falcons
from China and Mongolia early in the season.
The authorities were updated at a later date.

[This information provides the background to the decision of the
Saudi authorities to carry out tests in the involved falcon center in
Riyadh and -- subsequent to obtaining several positive H5 results --
to cull (all?) 37 falcons therein.
These unofficial but reliable data should be brought to the attention
of all those involved in the maintenance, handling and healthcare of
falcons and other captive birds in the Middle East and elsewhere.
Hopefully, it will help in enhancing the alertness of authorities
responsible for control upon international trade in avians, with
special attention to captive birds. Earlier H5N1 incidents related to
such trade have been recorded in Taiwan, Belgium, the UK and probably
elsewhere. - Mod.AS]
