Reacting to a food poisoning outbreak is like fighting a fire. You start by trying to smother the flames yourself, but you have to be ready to use a fire extinguisher and, if things get out of hand, call in the fire department. Similarly, Toronto Public Health is currently heading up the investigation into reported cases of foodborne illness at the CNE [Canadian National Exhibition], which as of Thu 22 Aug 2013, were nearing 100. But there is a slew of agencies waiting in the wings should the outbreak continue to grow, setting off a domino-chain of intervention that could eventually bring in the WHO.

For now, Epic Burgers and Waffles has been shut down and public health has sent food samples from the CNE booth to the lab for testing. Results are expected in 48 to 72 hours. "In the time that we've been operating at the CNE we have had a clean bill of health and all our staff have been fully trained in food safety," the company said in a statement posted on its Facebook page. "We buy our products from only the top suppliers and we've never had any issues in the past, nor do we wish to have any in the future."

Dr Lisa Berger, the city's associate medical officer of health, said that, "based on information to date, Toronto Public Health has concentrated our investigation around one food premise located at the CNE. However, all possible sources of illness are being investigated." She said "overall risk to the general public is low."

Many of those who fell sick point to the cronut burger, a croissant-doughnut-cheeseburger hybrid that the Star's food tester Michele Henry described as "a cheese swiped beef patty slapped between 2 cinnamon sugar croissant-doughnut halves and topped generously with homemade 'maple bacon jam.'"

Asked about the food poisoning, Mayor Rob Ford worried that it would affect attendance at the CNE. "Probably now it's safer than ever. Now that we've had all the health inspectors through, I encourage people to go there. And if people are still getting sick, then we have a real severe problem on our hands" that will need to be reviewed quickly, he said.

In any foodborne outbreak, epidemiologists follow a well-established procedure to track down the source of the illness, eliminate the immediate risk and prevent it from recurring. "It's really a cookbook approach," said Dr Arlene King, chief medical officer of Health for Ontario. "Excuse the pun."
