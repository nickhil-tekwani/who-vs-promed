Jaundice outbreak blamed on contaminated water supply
-----------------------------------------------------
Residents here are continuing to fall ill and one has died after
contracting jaundice, which may be attributed to a contaminated
drinking water supply, a Diligent Media Corporation reported.

The 12 Mar 2010 story said around 400 families have been consuming
the water for one month and about 65 people have become ill with the
disease. A 58-year-old resident is one of the people with jaundice
and he lost his daughter-in-law to the disease on 23 Feb 2010.

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) distributed chlorine to
purify the water. In January [2010], BMC collected a total of 2143
water samples, 10 of which tested positive for _E. coli_. Then, in
February [2010], 1987 water samples were taken and 36 samples tested
positive for _E. coli_.

Ganpat Tambe, secretary of the housing society, said in the story,
"Even we have cleaned our water tanks twice, but nothing seems to
solve the problem. In the morning when the water supply starts, we
get contaminated water in our homes every day."

A civic official, who wished to remain anonymous, said in the story,
"Normally complaints of water contamination or water-borne disease
increase during the monsoon season, but this is strange."

[The recurrent detection of _E. coli_ organisms in the water supply
of a Mumbai suburb is an indication of fecal contamination in the
supply system. The occurrence of jaundice is suggestive of hepatitis
A virus infection, which has been frequently associated with
contaminated drinking water supplies. Water-borne outbreaks of
jaundice, though infrequent, are usually associated with
sewage-contaminated or inadequately treated water. Casual contact
among people does not spread hepatitis A virus.

The symptoms of hepatitis A virus infection range from mild to
severe, and can include fever, malaise, loss of appetite, diarrhoea,
nausea, abdominal discomfort, dark-colored urine and jaundice. Not
everyone who is infected will have all of the symptoms. Adults have
signs and symptoms of illness more often than children, and the
severity of disease and mortality increases in older age groups, with
jaundice occurring in more than 70 percent of cases. Most people
recover in several weeks -- or sometimes months -- without
complications. There is no specific treatment for hepatitis A, but
several effective hepatitis A virus vaccines are available. Further
