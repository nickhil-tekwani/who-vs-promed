Growers are warned about possible damage to tomatoes. Along the route
Angol-Renaico [northern Araucania], tomato plants are drying out from
a strange disease. It seems that the disease is not yet under control
and it can produce big losses for small farmers in that region.

[So far,] 300 hectares [approx 740 acres] have been affected. Local
growers [usually] take bank loans over 30 and 60 days, but this
catastrophe is making it very difficult to pay their debts.

[Drying out of tomato plants can be due to a number of fungal and
bacterial wilt and root rot pathogens. With the limited information
provided above it is not possible to determine the cause of the
problem. We would be grateful for further information.
