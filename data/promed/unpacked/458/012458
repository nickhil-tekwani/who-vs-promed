In the UK the Department of Health issues an annual press statement
advising pregnant women to avoid close contact with sheep during the
lambing season. Preganant women are at rsik from hlamydiosis, toxoplasmosis
and listeriosis which can occur in some ewes. Close contact can be defined
as help with lambing, milking ewes, contact with newborn or aborted lambs,
contact with placenta and membranes and contact with clothing that has been
in contact with ewes or lambs.
