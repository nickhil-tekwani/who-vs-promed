Thirty-three people in Russia's Volgograd region have died and another 559
have been sickened with meningitis since the outbreak of the epidemic
caused by West Nile virus, officials said on Tuesday.
The infection spreads through mosquitoes, with insects catching it from
water fowl, the officials from Russia's State Sanitary and Epidemiological
Service told [reporters. The virus is mostly found in Africa, but there
are natural contagion areas both in Europe and Russia, they said.

[It may be that West Nile virus infections are comprising an emerging
disease. A spate of recent outbreaks, posted as noted above, as well as a
few cases in the Czech Republic
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol5no4/letters.htm#HubÃ¡lek>, may only
reflect better surveillance (doubtful). 559 sick and 33 dead seems like a
huge number of cases of illness caused by this virus in one place at one
time. Can anyone tell us who did the laboratory diagnosis (virus
isolations? serology only?)? Having a virus isolate to sequence would be
epidemiologically useful. Vincent Deubel, Pasteur Institute, Paris, likely
would be interested in obtaining an isolate for such comparisons. - Mod.CHC
