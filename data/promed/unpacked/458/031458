Foot and mouth invades Russia from China
----------------------------------------
Foot and mouth disease [FMD] has crossed from China into Russia's Far East,
forcing a trade ban on the infected Amur region.
The outbreak of the disease was registered in the village of Busse, where
an immediate quarantine was enforced, regional emergency ministry officials
said Thursday [16 Jun 2005].
Most of the sick animals belonged to small farms, which would not receive
any compensation for the destroyed livestock.
FMD is a highly contagious illness that affects cows, sheep, pigs and
horses [sic; equines are resistant to FMD. - Mod.AS]. Humans are not at
risk from the disease.
In 2001, a large-scale outbreak of the disease spread across Europe after
originating in Britain. [In fact, after reaching Britain within the
intercontinental spread of PanAsia FMD O strain or Middle-East/Southern
Asia (ME-SA) topotype. - Mod.AS]
The last FMD outbreak was registered in the Amur region during the summer
of 2004, when over 2000 infected cows and pigs were destroyed. [See
commentary below].

[The 2 official reports of Russia to the OIE on the 2004 outbreak mentioned
a total number of 141 dairy cows (12 months old) exposed to the virus,
which was identified as serotype O of the pan-Asian group. 87 of them were
clinically affected; 890 animals -- including in-contact animals -- were
destroyed. The current media-derived data concerning 2004's outbreak are
somewhat different, particularly in regard to the alleged involvement of
pigs. Clarifications will help.
As to the current outbreak, caused by a different serotype (Asia 1), here
also there are discrepancies between official and unofficial data,
particularly regarding the numbers of affected animals. The 2 affected
bovines mentioned in the official notification might reflect the number of
sampled animals tested in the laboratory. It will be helpful to obtain the
number of exposed and clinically affected animals, and to exclude -- or
otherwise -- the possibility that pigs are involved as well. - Mod.AS]
