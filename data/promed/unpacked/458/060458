Scotland hospitals hit by Viral Gastroenteritis
--------------------------------------------------
A number of patients and members of staff have suffered from gastric flu at
Dykebar hospital in Paisley. So far 12 wards at the hospital, which treats
patients with mental illness, have been closed. Experts have identified the
bug as [small round structured viruses, otherwise known as "Norwalk-like
viruses]. [The same virus is thought] to have contributed to the deaths of
2 elderly patients at Perth Royal Infirmary earlier this week.
Initially some 133 people were affected at Dykebar, but a spokesman said an
outbreak control team had met on Friday afternoon and there were now just
10 patients affected by the virus. All the patients were said to be
displaying "mild to moderate" symptoms. The spokesman said: "The sharp
decline in numbers is because those who have been affected by the illness
are kept under observation for a further 48 hours after their symptoms
cease and only then are they given the all-clear.
NHS Tayside said a further 11 people at the Perth hospital had been
affected by the illness, taking the total number of cases to 59. Officials
believe the bug came into the Earn Ward, a 24-bed elderly care assessment
unit, from outside the affected wards. Dr Mike Roworth, NHS Tayside's
public health medicine consultant, said: "While the appearance of this
infection in another ward at PRI is naturally of concern to us, it is not
surprising given that this kind of viral infection appears to be very
common in the community at present. "There is no evidence, however, that
this infection has spread to Earn Ward from another part of the hospital
and it appears it may have come into the ward from the community."
The virus outbreak at both hospitals means that as many as 103 patients and
30 staff were affected by the virus at Dykebar hospital, and 59 people are
affected by the virus at Perth Royal Infirmary. As of 27 Sep 2002, 6 new
cases have been reported at PRI and those infected staff have been sent home.
The virus symptoms include diarrhea, vomiting, and stomach cramps and
usually improve within 48 hours. There is no specific treatment for the
symptoms other than taking in plenty of liquids to prevent dehydration.
