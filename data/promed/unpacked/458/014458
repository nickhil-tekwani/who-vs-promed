Japanese encephalitis outbreak feared in Uttarakhand
----------------------------------------------------
Doctors of Haldwani district in Uttarakhand fear an outbreak of the
much-dreaded Japanese encephalitis fever, as 5 patients complaining
about fever have been admitted in a local hospital.

The medical officials have sent few blood samples of the infected
patients to National Institute of Communicable diseases in New Delhi
for examination.

The officials are eagerly awaiting the results so that they can
ensure proper immunization before the disease grips the state.

"Few blood samples of the patients have been sent to Delhi of which
[3 are from patients from the medical division and 2 are from
[Memorial Forest division]. After their reports come [we will be
able] to say whether they are suffering from Japanese encephalitis or
not," said Balbir Chabbra, medical superintendent, Sushila Tiwari
Memorial Forest Hospital, Haldwani.

The symptoms of Japanese encephalitis virus [infection] are seemingly
mild, but the disease can cause meningitis and inflammation of the
heart in newborn babies.

India's worst encephalitis outbreak in 2005 claimed over 1500 lives.

According to doctors, the death rate due to Japanese encephalitis
[infection] is 28-56 percent.

The deadly Japanese encephalitis fever is caused by a virus found in
pigs and wild birds and transferred to humans by mosquito bite. It
affects the brain and causes headaches, convulsions, high fever, and
respiratory distress.

Many survivors are left mentally or physically handicapped.

[Establishing a diagnosis of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV)
infection in these cases will require laboratory confirmation.
ProMED-mail requests information concerning the laboratory results
when they become available.

Uttar Pradesh is experiencing an outbreak of encephalitis cases,
presumably due to JEV infection.

Uttarakhand is approximately 210 km (130 miles) north of Delhi, and
nearly 500 km (310 miles) northwest of Gorakhpur, where an
encephalitis outbreak, also presumably due to JEV, has caused almost
372 cases and 88 deaths.

The Uttar Pradesh state health minister indicated that vaccine sent
to the state was unfit for human use, with a resulting delay in the
JEV vaccination drive, leaving many individuals unimmunized and
susceptible to JEV infection (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20080918.2924).
