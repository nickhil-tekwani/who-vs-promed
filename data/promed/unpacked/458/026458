In January [2021], Rosemont Court, an affordable housing complex for seniors in North Portland, saw its 1st residents fall sick with Legionnaires' disease, an illness spread by bacteria in tiny water droplets. The county confirmed 6 cases and suspected 4 others based on symptoms. By June, another 3 seniors had gotten sick. Leaders with Northwest Housing Alternatives, a nonprofit that owns the building, said they would pay residents' relocation costs while they worked to find the source of the outbreak. But some seniors say Northwest Housing Alternatives and the company that runs the building, Income Property Management, haven't addressed the real problem: they can't afford to live anywhere else.

[Everywhere] either had a years-long waitlist or was charging double or triple current rent of USD 380 a month. Often, it was both. (Northwest Housing Alternatives receives a federal tax credit to keep Rosemont Court affordable for low-income seniors.) Experts say the wait times for permanent affordable housing for seniors in the region range between 2 and 5 years. [Seniors] say they are stuck at Rosemont Court -- now home to one of the largest and longest-lasting Legionnaires' outbreaks in Multnomah County history.

Typically, people only hear about Legionnaires' disease when there's an outbreak on a cruise ship or a nursing home. In reality, the bacteria are commonly found in low concentration in fresh water. Most healthy people who inhale the bacteria never know. That's part of what makes the source of an outbreak so hard to find -- the bacteria are everywhere.

Ten months after the 1st case was reported to Multnomah County health officials, regulators said they believe the outbreak is limited to the building. But they still don't know precisely where the bacteria are coming from within the complex, a collection of studio, 1-bedroom and 2-bedroom apartments.

The organisms cluster and multiply in places where water stagnates such as a water tank or pipe. As the colony [of _Legionella_] grows, chunks can break off and flow into residents' homes through tap faucets or shower heads.

Michele Swanson, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Michigan, said it's common for health officials to struggle to find the source of an outbreak. In 25 years studying Legionnaires', Swanson said she's heard of outbreaks that stretch anywhere from months to decades. In these cases, health experts will often treat the water in a building with chlorine to knock down the number of bacteria. But the colonies [of _Legionella_] can be stubborn -- due, in part, to a thick outer shell the organisms grow that shield them from the treatment. Within a few months, the population will start to grow back. In a notorious years-long outbreak in an Illinois veteran's home beginning in 2015, officials gave up on tinkering with the plumbing and demolished the dorms. By then, 14 residents had died.

Older people with weakened immune systems are much more likely to get sick with a severe type of pneumonia. Roughly one in 10 people who get sick with the disease will die. Swanson said that if her family members were living in a senior home like Rosemont, she would not let them wait around for the outbreak to be resolved. "I would get them out of there," she said.

County health officials, the Portland Water Bureau, and the building owner all say they're trying to keep the property as safe as possible for the seniors living there. They have emptied the water lines, installed special filters to showerheads and faucets, and added chlorine and a new disinfecting system. A notice posted inside the building's elevator from February [2021] informs residents that the treatment is "almost certainly more than sufficient to make sure your home was safe." But the building still isn't safe. Roughly one month after the notice in the elevator went up, [one] resident was treated for Legionnaires' for the 2nd time.

[This resident's] 1st case, one of the earliest at Rosemont Court, was diagnosed in January [2021]. [The man], 77, said he was hospitalized for 2.5 months. While he was in the hospital, the county moved about 100 of his neighbors to hotels while they tried to trace the outbreak. By March, [he] and the rest of the seniors had returned to Rosemont Court. Within a month, he had been diagnosed again with Legionnaires'.

[In June 2021, ProMED posted a report (Legionellosis - USA (04): (OR) fatal, apt. complex, more cases after remediation 20210625.8475267) of this outbreak involving 13 cases of Legionnaires' disease that occurred in the 6 months between January 2021 and 23 Jun 2021 in residents of an apartment building (Rosemont Court) for seniors that included one death; 3 of the 13 cases occurred between 17 Mar 2021 and 23 Jun 2021 after attempts at remediation in the apartment building. The news report above says that the total remains at 13 cases, with no new cases apparently having occurred since 23 Jun 2021. We have not been told if additional attempts at remediation have occurred since June to explain the absence of new cases.

Eradication of _Legionella_ bacteria from plumbing systems is often difficult. Long-term persistence within these water systems is favored by the intracellular location of _Legionella_ within several species of protozoa, where _Legionella_ replicate and which provide protection from environmental stressors, like biocides and heat treatment; the formation of biofilms allows adherence of _Legionella_ to the inner surfaces of the plumbing systems (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5835138/).

_Legionella pneumophila_, the usual _Legionella_ species causing legionellosis in the USA, has been shown to persist for long periods in biofilms in a viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state after exposure to a biocide or heat treatment (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515819/). Monitoring _L. pneumophila_ in water systems usually done by culture would miss VBNC _Legionella_, which can be revived by the subsequent addition of ameba (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18839249).

Rosemont Court is described as "an older historic building" with studio, 1-, and 2-bedroom apartments (https://www.rent.com/oregon/portland-apartments/rosemont-court-4-lnp001E000000nye2DIAQ).
