Rabies Alert Issued In Seminole County Florida
4 Animals Test Positive Over Past Few Days
--------------------------------------------
The Seminole County Health Department has issued a rabies alert for
residents of the county. According to health officials, 4 animals have
tested positive for rabies since 14 Jan 2001, including 2 raccoons, a fox
and a horse. The health department has issued the following guidelines:
Every dog, cat and ferret must be vaccinated against rabies and pets must
also be kept on a leash or in a fenced yard. [The alert also stated that
residents should not leave pet food outside or feed animals outside; that
property should be kept free of garbage; that residents should not keep
wildlife as pets or interact with strange or sick domestic pets (including
stray cats), livestock, or wild animals. - Man. Ed. DS]
Health officials said residents should call [Seminole County] Animal
Services immediately [407-665-5201] if they notice a stray animal in their
neighborhood. Anyone who is bitten by an animal should wash the wound
immediately with soap and water and report the incident to Animal Services.
The alert will remain in effect for 60 days, unless otherwise changed by
the health department.

[It is surprising the official alert did not include vaccinating horses.
Horses may acquire rabies through inadvertent contact with wild animals.
Horses come into contact with so many people by nature of their companion
animal status. Horses should have been included in this alert. - Mod. TG]
