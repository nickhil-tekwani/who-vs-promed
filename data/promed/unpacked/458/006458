Statement to the press by Dr Hans Henri P Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Globally, with 9 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and over 400 000 deaths reported to WHO, the pandemic continues to accelerate, with a record number of new coronavirus cases reported on Sunday [21 Jun 2020], with 183 020 confirmed in 24 hours.

Over 2.5 million cases have been reported from Europe. While the European Region is reporting a decreasing proportion of global cases than earlier in the year, the Region continues to report close to 20 000 new cases and over 700 new deaths daily. Last week [week of 15 Jun 2020], Europe saw an increase in weekly cases for the 1st time in months.

For weeks I have spoken about the risk of resurgence as countries adjust measures. In several countries across Europe, this risk has now become a reality -- 30 countries/territories have seen increases in new cumulative cases over the past 2 weeks. In 11 of these countries/territories [see below], accelerated transmission has led to very significant resurgence that if left unchecked will push health systems to the brink once again in Europe.

Countries such as Poland, Germany, Spain, and Israel have responded quickly to dangerous outbreaks of COVID-19 associated with schools, coal mines, and food production settings that have occurred over the past several weeks. Where new clusters of cases appeared, these have been controlled through rapid and targeted interventions. This is very good news! Bravo to the authorities!

And on another positive note, several Ministers of Health reported a change in people's behaviour, namely that they are adhering to physical distancing and wearing facial masks. Bravo to the people!

At the same time, we need to get smarter in using the evidence and the information we have from our COVID-19 surveillance systems to improve the only way we have to minimise transmission: find, isolate, test, and care for every case. Trace and quarantine every contact.

Here, digital technology can play a leading role, not least to support contact tracing. Austria, Georgia, and North Macedonia are among the 27 countries that have released national solutions for digital contact tracing in Europe; with at least another 4 countries (Andorra, Finland, Ireland, Portugal) having solutions underway.

Digital technology and artificial intelligence have also proved to be effective in other aspects of pandemic response. In France, an artificial intelligence-based virtual phone assistant is able to respond to more than a thousand people at the same time. Italy is trialling use of an AI-based technology that utilizes a smartphone app and camera to capture vital statistics such as heart rate, heart rate variability, oxygen saturation, and respiration rate in real time. In Sweden, telemedicine has been used to support traditional care, particularly in rural settings, and is now being used for enhanced COVID-19 response. Digital technologies have proved to be powerful tools to fight COVID-19. However, these same technologies have exposed us to a tsunami of information and have raised many issues around data protection and privacy.

Here, I wish to convey 3 messages:
First, go digital but go wisely. Digital helps health systems cope with delivery of essential health care, particularly during emergencies. But integrating digital health must be done carefully and wisely, in partnership with the public and patients.

Second, it's all about trust. Digital tools rely on public trust. Interventions must consider the privacy and security of individuals and their data. Fundamental human and gender rights must be preserved in digital environments and must not be forgone in times of a pandemic. It is the responsibility of governments to address data ownership, use, consent, and protection.

Third, we cannot afford to have people that cannot afford digital health. Not all social groups are equally able to harness the potential of digital technologies to combat the virus. In the European Region, national data on household internet access varies from 74% to 87%, with greater variation at subnational levels and between population groups. We cannot afford a digital divide on top of the social and economic divide.

So, 3 messages:
1. Go digital, but go wisely
2. Build trust by respecting privacy
3. Address the digital gap.

The full potential of digital health is yet to be realized. It is about empowering people to make healthy life style decisions to create a European culture of health. Ultimately, it is about leaving no one behind.

[According to BBC (thanks to Mary Marshall <mjm2020@googlemail.com> for submitting the article), "The 11 countries and territories were later identified by the WHO as Armenia, Sweden, Moldova, North Macedonia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kyrgyzstan, Ukraine, and Kosovo." These are areas we have flagged in the Worldometer section of our posts as places to keep an eye on. Basically, the Balkan States and the Newly Independent States seem to be heavily represented in this group. - Mod.MPP

[2] Africa: female community health workers
Date: Thu 25 Jun 2020 2:12 AM EAT
Source: Thompson Reuters Foundation [edited]

Armed with a face mask, notebook and pen, Everlyne Akinyi Omondi sets out each morning from her one-room home in Nairobi's informal settlement of Kawangware to do a job few others would contemplate in a pandemic. As cases of the new coronavirus climb and Kenyans are told to stay home and avoid human contact, 38-year-old Omondi moves house to house through Kawangware's maze of narrow lanes.

Standing at the doorways of the cramped, corrugated houses, she talks about COVID-19, shows residents how to wash hands or don a mask, patiently answering their questions. "I know there are risks of contracting the virus, but I don't feel so scared. I have made a pledge to keep my community safe," said Omondi, turning to reprimand a group of children crowded around her for not maintaining social distancing rules. "You see how small and close together the places where we live are. We have to make sure people understand how they can stop corona from spreading. Here, if one person gets it, everyone can."

The mother of 3 is not a doctor, nurse, or medic of any sort -- just one of tens of thousands of ordinary African women who, without fanfare, battle the virus in their communities. Poorly paid or not at all, these unsung armies of mostly female community health workers have for years doled out advice and health services to families living in remote villages and urban slums who lack formal support.

Recruited and trained by government and charities -- they are found from Kenya to Tanzania, Ethiopia to Malawi, Liberia to South Africa -- the women go door to door, dispensing advice on everything from family planning to immunisations. Now, as transmission of the new coronavirus spreads, women like Omondi are essential foot soldiers in the war on COVID-19.

Charities such as Catholic Relief Services, which is supporting coronavirus training for about 5000 community health volunteers in Kenya, say this workforce is key. "Community health volunteers are not given the recognition they deserve, but they are important frontline workers. They have a wide range of knowledge and experience from dealing with cholera outbreaks to malaria prevention," said Moses Orinda, CRS's senior project officer in Kenya.

"For COVID-19, they have the ability to contact trace, provide support to home-based patients and conduct essential prevention and control activities," Orinda said.

Community transmission
----------------------
The COVID-19 virus has infected close to 10 million people and killed almost half a million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University.

Initially, the virus multiplied more slowly in Africa than in Asia or Europe, but all 54 nations on the continent are now infected, with more than 330 000 cases and over 8800 deaths combined, says the African Union's Centre for Disease Control. South Africa, Egypt, and Nigeria have recorded most cases, but experts say true numbers may be much higher as many nations lack reliable diagnostic or testing capabilities.

With densely-packed slums, poor access to water, widespread disease, and weak health systems, many countries will struggle to control the fast-spreading virus, they add. "For now, Africa still only accounts for a small fraction of cases worldwide," said Matshidiso Moeti, the World Health Organization (WHO) Africa director, earlier this month [June 2020]. "But the pace of the spread is quickening. Swift and early action by African countries has helped to keep numbers low, but constant vigilance is needed to stop COVID-19 from overwhelming health facilities."

More than half of African countries have witnessed community transmission -- cases where patients have no travel history or known contact with infected people -- suggesting the virus is moving undetected in the population, says WHO. This is not hard to believe. Many cities are home to sprawling, overcrowded settlements, housing tens of thousands of people, where the key to containing the spread -- hand-washing and social distancing -- are a luxury.

In Kawangware, there is scant access to water or the space for self-isolation. Families of 5 live in 1-room shacks. There is no piped water and households share toilets. According to the United Nations, only 14% of Kenyans have the facilities to wash their hands at home with soap and water.

The warning from WHO is stark: up to 190 000 Africans could die if containment measures such as contact tracing, isolation, personal hygiene, and distancing are not improved.

'Invisible' armies
------------------
Already known and respected, community health workers are a perfect 1st-line response to a pandemic, say health experts. Raj Panjabi, of Harvard Medical School and CEO of Last Mile Health, said community health workers showed their value when another deadly virus hit in Liberia. "When Ebola threatened to bring humanity to its knees, informal community providers stepped up to learn the signs and symptoms of Ebola, to team up with nurses and doctors, to go door to door to find the sick and get them into care," he said.

"You couldn't have stopped the epidemic without a ground force of these community members." One of their key jobs is busting myths and slaying stigmas. A belief that only whites get the virus or that it can be cured with hot, sweet tea is rampant, while mass testing is elusive due to the stigma a positive result can carry.

Government health officials say the women have built up trust through years of contact so locals are happy to pay heed. "We know that they can pass messages on which sometimes the government cannot. They live in the same communities and have good social standing, so it is much easier for them to do provide information," said Catherine Mugo, a sub-county community strategy coordinator at Kenya's ministry of health. Mugo isn't far wrong.

As Omondi wends through the knot of narrow alleys that make up Kawangware, residents rush out to greet her, children give chase, and women break off from hanging washing for her advice. What to do if there is no money for soap? Borrowing a bucket, water, and bleach, she shows them how to make a safe chlorine solution strong enough to kill the virus.

Some can't afford to buy face masks for running errands. Stay home, she orders; send out somebody who does own one. "Everlyne is good. She has brought us new information," said resident [PG]. "She has shown us new ways."

Health professionals and charity workers say governments need to value this workforce -- to give them a living wage as well as the personal protective equipment needed to work safely. Omondi, who has been working as a community health volunteer for 10 years without pay and is responsible for 100 households in her neighbourhood, would welcome some recognition.

"Having a salary or some stipend would be really useful," said Omondi, whose 5-strong family struggles to get by. "But you know, most of us are doing this work because we have something in (our) heart that tells us that we cannot let our neighbour suffer."

[Two days ago, we had an upbeat report of the relative success in Thailand through the help of community volunteer health workers. This report is very similar, reflecting on the value of the cadre of predominantly female community health workers in Africa, and the impact they have in their communities, especially more able to assist in education efforts, contact tracing, and seeing to self quarantine compliance, in resource poor areas (see COVID-19 update (278): Thailand, China, WHO, global 20200623.7500399 [1] Thailand, what has been working so far....). These healthcare volunteers have the trust of their communities -- a critical factor in helping spread the word on do's and don'ts during the pandemic, and what is feasible and realistic in the community.

Cadres of these community health workers have had success in pre- and post-natal care and education helping to markedly reduce the incidence of neonatal tetanus to less than 1 per 1000 live births in many countries around the world.

A recent article in the New York Times mentioned the problems the new cadre of contact tracers were having in New York City, unable to locate infected individuals or get information from them on their contacts. Both challenges that this community based cadre of health volunteers in other countries can overcome as they have the trust of their communities and access to the homes, something strangers do not easily have (see https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/21/nyregion/nyc-contact-tracing.html for more details).

Something more countries should think about for public health interventions moving forward, and now. - Mod.MPP

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 25 Jun 2020.

Highlights
----------
- Speaking at the [24 Jun 2020] media briefing on COVID-19, the Director-General highlighted work by WHO and UN partners to ensure global supplies of oxygen for treating patients and discussed the difficult choices all countries must make in holding gatherings of large numbers of people.

- The government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo today declared the end of the country's 10th outbreak of Ebola virus disease. Many of the public health measures that have been successful in stopping Ebola remaining essential for suppressing COVID-19. Healthcare workers trained in clinical management, and infection prevention and control, as part of the Ebola response, are redeploying to fight COVID-19.

- As cases of COVID-19 in the Americas remain high, WHO's Regional Director for the Americas, Dr Carissa F Etienne cautioned that "We must be realistic about the future: all of us must adjust to a new way of life and redefine our sense of normal." She reiterated "though we rejoice when one country successfully flattens its COVID-19 epidemic curve, the risk of re-emergence will always remain unless we flatten the curve regionally and globally."

Today's 'subject in focus' discusses an update on the interim guidance on Critical preparedness, readiness, and response actions for COVID-19.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
-----------------------------------------
The Americas region reported 58.1% of the global newly reported cases and 68.6% of newly reported deaths for this 24-hour period. Brazil reported 40.6% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, the USA reported 35.2%. Mexico 6.5%, Chile 3.8%, Peru 3.5%, Colombia 2.5%, and Argentina 2.4%. The same 5 countries remained at the top; The USA and Brazil are usually numbers 1 and 2 although they vary for which of the 2 positions they hold, but Argentina is continuing to increase its proportional representation within the region..

The European region reported 11.3% of the global newly reported cases and 8.3% of the newly confirmed deaths in the region. Russia reported 37.5% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Turkey and Sweden 7.9%, Ukraine 5.2%, Armenia 4.1%, the UK 3.4%, Germany 3.3%, Azerbaijan 3.1%, Italy 3.0%, Kazakhstan 2.7%, and Belarus 2.4%. Again, the same countries with the addition of Sweden, minor juggling of orders and percentages day by day, although the proportion of cases represented by Russia has fallen. Note the appearance of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan joining Sweden, Ukraine, and Belarus as 6 out of the 11 countries mentioned in Section [1] above.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 11.3% of the global newly reported cases and 10.6% of global newly reported fatalities. Pakistan reported 21.4% of the regional newly reported cases followed by Saudi Arabia 16.5%, Iran 13.4%, Iraq 11.6%, Egypt 7.5%, Qatar 6.3%, and Oman 6.0%. Same countries, minor juggling of positions.

The African region reported 5.4% of the global newly reported cases and 2.8% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 63.1% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Nigeria 7.2%, Ghana 4.9%, Cote d'Ivoire 2.9%, Kenya 2.8%, Cameroon 2.5%, and Ethiopia and DR Congo 2.1% each. While South Africa and Nigeria are usually numbers 1 and 2 in terms of the 24-hour increase in cases, other countries have less consistent reporting patterns and vary considerably from day to day although Cameroon, Ethiopia, DR Congo, and Mauritania (1.9%) bear watching.

The Western Pacific region reported 0.51% of the global newly reported cases and 0.47% of global deaths. The Philippines reported 55.7% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Singapore 22.6%, Japan 10.%, Australia 3.4%, South Korea 3.3%, and China 2.5%. The outbreak associated with the Beijing Seafood markets continues to bring China to prominence in terms of daily newly confirmed cases. That said, the Philippines and Singapore are consistently numbers 1 and 2, respectively, and the other countries, including Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Australia, vary in daily reporting.

The South East Asia region reported 13.3% of the global newly reported cases and 9.2% of global deaths. India reported 76.4% of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 15.6%, Indonesia 5.0%, and Nepal 2.8%. Same countries, same order as in previous days, with India continuing to be the driving force in the regional growth in cases.

Impression: Europe seems to be stabilizing at a significantly lower rate, although Russia is still reporting 7000+ new cases a day (down from 8000+ per day), and while the former hotspots have been decreasing their cases, new areas are increasing such as Sweden, the Baltic states, and the Newly Independent States. The Eastern Mediterranean had surpassed the European region in the past few days, but is slightly behind for the past 48 hours (24 and 25 Jun 2020), with Pakistan reporting around 4000+ cases a day and Saudi Arabia reporting around 4000+ cases a day (over 3100 today 25 Jun 2020). South East Asia has overtaken both the European and Eastern Mediterranean regions, with India reporting 8000-10 000+ cases a day (over 16 000 cases today 25 Jun 2020). The Americas region is usually reporting around 70 000 cases a day (over 97 000 cases today 24 Jun 2020), with Brazil usually reporting 25 000-30 000+ cases a day (over 39 000 cases today 25 Jun 2020) and the USA at 20 000-25 000+ a day (over 34 000 today 25 Jun 2020). In the Africa region, the regional proportion is slowly climbing, with South Africa reporting in the 3000-4000+ range daily (over 5000 today 25 Jun 2020), and the Western Pacific region is maintaining a very low rate compared with the other regions, with the Philippines averaging 500+ cases per day (over 400 cases today 25 Jun 2020). (Singapore had been reporting twice as many cases per day for a period of time but has dropped back over the past couple of weeks).

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 25 Jun 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. Europe has significantly decreased. The Americas region continues to increase, as does South East Asia, in terms of daily newly confirmed cases; the African region is noticeably increasing as well. The Americas region continues to greatly outnumber all other regions for daily reporting. - Mod.MPP]

[*On 2 Jun 2020, France completed a review of all positive lab tests reported and removed all duplicate tests on individuals who were counted more than once. This led to a decrease in cumulative case counts.
In the table above, NA is "not applicable"; those countries whose 1st case was reported after 1 Mar 2020 did not have cases on 1 Mar 2020. - Mod.MPP]

Countries with more than 5000 cases not on the list above (as the list has grown longer, we froze the list and maintain a list of countries passing the 5000-case mark):

[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of reported cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 9 710 205, with reports of cases by 217 countries and territories worldwide. The global case count rose by 1.9% in the past 24 hours. The USA, with more than 2.50 million confirmed cases, now represents 25.8% of the global cases of COVID-19, and Brazil, having crossed the 1 million mark (more than 1.23 million cases), represents 12.7% of the global cases of COVID-19. Other countries such as Chile, Peru, Mexico, India, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Pakistan are reporting increased numbers of new and cumulative cases as well. A global total of 491 783 deaths have been reported, an increase of 6827 deaths in the past 24 hours. A reminder that in the absence of well-developed contact-tracing activities with testing of asymptomatic and mildly ill contacts, numbers of SARS-CoV-2 virus infections are significantly underreported: actual numbers may be 10-20 times larger. There are also individuals who stay at home throughout their illness, sometimes, unfortunately, dying at home, who are never officially confirmed as infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These data are presented to provide relative indicators of the situations in each of the countries and comparisons between countries and regions of the world.

In descending rank order, the USA is number 1 for cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19, followed by Brazil, Russia, India, the UK, Spain, Peru, Chile, Italy, and Iran at number 10. China is number 21. In descending rank order, The USA is number 1 for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by Brazil, India, Russia, South Africa, Mexico, Chile, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Peru, all countries that are currently experiencing major community-based transmission and considered global hot spots.

The top 20 countries in terms of cumulative cases include 7 from the European region, 6 from the Americas region, 5 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 1 from the South-East Asia region, and 1 from the African region, an increase in 1 from the Eastern Mediterranean region and decrease of 1 from the South East Asia region. There are no countries from the Western Pacific region. The top 20 countries in terms of numbers of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours include 8 from the Americas region, 6 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 3 from the European region, 2 from the South East Asia region, and 1 from the African region, unchanged in the past 24 hours. Again, there are no countries from the Western Pacific region. This listing very much reflects the "hot spots" in terms of countries and regions with ongoing high transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. - Mod.MPP]
