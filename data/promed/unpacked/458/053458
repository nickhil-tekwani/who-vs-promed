About 2 million Zambians have bilharzias
----------------------------------------
The government [of Zambia] has disclosed that about 2 million people are
currently affected with bilharzia in the country. The minister of
education, Geoffrey Lungwangwa, said that the bilharzia prevalence rate is
currently estimated at 90 per cent in some communities, a situation that
has affected the performance of pupils and growth of children.

Professor Lungwangwa disclosed this today when he officially opened a
training workshop for teachers on bilharzia and soil transmitted infections
in Lusaka. He said it is important to treat bilharzia and intestinal worms
at an early stage because it could affect fertility in women and kidney
damage in men. Professor Lungwangwa noted that bilharzia was found in all
the provinces and districts in Zambia, particularly those found near lakes
and rivers.

He added that infections such as intestinal worms are very common
throughout the country, which might result in children and pregnant women
having anemia. Professor Lungwangwa said the training of teachers will go a
long way in fighting the prevalence of the disease at the source among
communities. He said at the end of the training workshop, the teachers will
have the capacity to assist in fighting the diseases in the country.

And speaking at the same occasion, Egyptian Ambassador to Zambia, Nuri
Betel Mal expressed happiness at the turnout of teachers and urged them to
ensure that they disseminate information in their communities and schools.

Mr Mal said that the training has been sponsored by the Arab League Fund,
which is aimed at providing technical assistance to African countries in
fighting diseases such as bilharzia.

[The data cited come from a report from a workshop held on 22-25 Jan 2009
in Lusaka "Schistosomiasis, HIV and Reproductive Health". The prevalence
data on schistosomiasis in Zambia are probably correct but the prevalence
is very uneven with areas with a very high rate of infection and other
areas with a low rate of infection.

At present WHO recommends 2 indicators for schistosomal morbidity -- namely
gross haematuria and ultrasound detectable changes in affected organs. WHO
recommends management of cases and to regularly treat school aged children
and other high-risk groups.

One of the conclusions from the workshop was that there is a lack of
information on co-morbidity and co-infections in, for instance,
schistosomiasis and HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). Further studies are
needed to find out whether schistosomiasis increases the risk of HIV
transmission and whether HIV infection increases pathology of
schistosomiasis. ProMED-mail wishes to thank Dr Birgitte Vennervald and
Thomas Kristensen from the Danish Center for Health Research and
Development for commenting on the report.
